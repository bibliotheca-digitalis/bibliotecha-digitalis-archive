00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello again, the gays.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,880
Welcome to my garden party fantasy.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,560
Straight people, you're of course welcome

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,440
to tag along too, provided you're emotionally damaged.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
Hi, hey, how are you?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,560
Cringe, let's talk about it.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,520
The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
It just pops into my head all the time.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,020
Like, when I randomly remember that month back in 2013

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,160
when all of my Facebook posts were just lyrics

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,320
to Ke$ha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,160
Why?

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,880
What audience was that for?

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,760
Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,840
Cringe, mega cringe.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,040
I think I say this word like 50 times a day.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,620
Cringe, cringe, cringe.

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,760
And I'm not the only one.

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,480
Google Trends shows that in the US,

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
search interest in the word cringe

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,200
has dramatically increased over the last decade,

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160
peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since.

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,760
And if you look at worldwide trends,

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,440
search interest in cringe is at an all-time high

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
the month I'm making this video.

26
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,000
So what is cringe?

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,480
Well, let's start with some examples.

28
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,760
There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled,

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
What Things Really Make You Cringe?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,160
And here's some of the most upvoted responses.

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,920
The time I was talking too loud at a wedding

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,280
when I wasn't supposed to,

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,800
and everyone at the wedding turned around

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,720
to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,240
Recordings of my own voice.

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,840
When I remember that I did the,

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,120
I do have a boyfriend, he just goes to another school thing.

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,980
Early teen me, so many cringe stuff I did.

39
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,440
I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.

40
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
This happened about two years ago.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
I ordered some pizza hot online,

42
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,040
and when it was delivered,

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,840
the lady handed me the pizza boxes.

44
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,920
I said, thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,320
I said, oh, and then she hands me the receipt

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,440
to sign and leave a tip,

47
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,060
and I spend 30 seconds trying to get the pen to work.

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,240
She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,140
I said, oh, and then she reaches to get the receipt

50
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,720
and tells me the pizza smells good.

51
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,280
Then I said, you too,

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,040
and then I closed the door and killed myself.

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,120
All of these responses illustrate exactly

54
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
what writer Melissa Dahl says in her book,

55
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.

56
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,260
According to Dahl, the moments that make us cringe

57
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,520
are when we're yanked out of our own perspective

58
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,180
and we can suddenly see ourselves

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,080
from somebody else's point of view.

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,440
She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter,

61
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,700
who in the 60s did a study of the Biame tribe in New Guinea,

62
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,400
where he showed them mirror, video,

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,960
and photographic images of themselves for the first time

64
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
and described the results.

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
They were paralyzed.

66
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,520
After their first startled response,

67
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
covering their mouths and ducking their heads,

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,160
they stood transfixed, staring at their images,

69
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,840
only their stomach muscles, betraying great tension.

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,080
So basically, they cringed at themselves.

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
Like, pretty much everyone seems to hate

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,400
the sound of their voice when they hear a recording

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
for the first time.

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
I guess because it sounds different

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,600
from the way you hear it resonating in your head.

77
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
So when you hear the recording, you realize,

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,680
oh God, that's how other people hear me all the time.

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
And you're suddenly aware of this clash

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
between the way you appear to yourself

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,480
and the way you appear to other people.

82
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,920
That's when you cringe, the feeling Dahl describes

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,580
as the intense visceral reaction produced

84
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,960
by an awkward moment, an unpleasant kind

85
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,760
of self-recognition, where you suddenly see yourself

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
through someone else's eyes.

87
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,640
It's a forced moment of self-awareness,

88
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,360
and it usually makes you cognizant

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
of the disappointing fact that you aren't measuring up

90
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,600
to your own self-concept.

91
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,320
When you're talking too loud at a wedding

92
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,840
and suddenly everyone turns around

93
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,800
to see what asshole wouldn't shut up,

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,960
you suddenly realize how you look to them,

95
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,240
because we've all at some point turned around

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,360
But this time, you're the asshole, cringe.

98
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,560
Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm

99
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,840
that makes us cringe.

100
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,580
There's no law of state or even of etiquette

101
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,880
that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed

102
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,920
to speak at a wedding.

103
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,720
It's something you have to intuit based on context.

104
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,360
How loud are other people speaking?

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Is the ceremony about to begin

106
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,000
and we're all supposed to be quiet now?

107
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,340
According to YouTuber Vsauce, Michael here,

108
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,960
the function of awkwardness is that

109
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,640
it sands social dynamics by smoothing out

110
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,560
what even etiquette doesn't rule on.

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,800
Cringe is the electric shock,

112
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,920
the emotional punishment for being awkward.

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,920
It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior

114
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,780
by wounding the ego.

115
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,440
And memories of your cringy moments

116
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,240
are often just as painful as the moments themselves.

117
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,360
10 years later, you'll be trying to fall asleep

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,860
and for no reason at all,

119
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,800
your brain will decide to remind you

120
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,080
of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding

121
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,040
and of the stupid thing you were saying

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,200
when everyone turned around to stare at you

123
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,680
and you'll cringe all over again.

124
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,520
That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
because you look back and you realize,

126
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years.

127
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,600
Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone

128
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,000
who remembers me before, I don't know, November?

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,100
Now all the examples we've considered so far

130
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,560
involve self-cringe,

131
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,360
but usually when we talk about cringe on the internet,

132
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,720
we're talking about cringing at other people.

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
Popular subreddits like r slash cringe,

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,120
cringepix, and cringetopia host videos and images

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,200
of people behaving in cringey ways.

136
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
For instance, a maternity photo

137
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
that looks like a hostage crisis,

138
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,560
grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry,

139
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,040
during his first encounter with black people.

141
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Who let the dogs out?

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
Who, who?

143
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,600
Ugh, watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire.

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
It makes me want to crawl out of my body

145
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,920
and escape into another dimension.

146
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others.

147
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,080
For me, it's uncomfortable to the point

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,720
where I will reflexively pause a video like that

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
because I just can't stand it.

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos,

151
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
which, sweaty, if you put that shit on,

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,200
I will leave the room.

153
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,040
So why is it that cringing at other people hurts

154
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,280
in the same way as cringing at yourself?

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,720
Well, one theory is that cringing at other people

156
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,240
is simply vicarious embarrassment,

157
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
or secondhand embarrassment.

158
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,760
Basically, it's a form of empathy.

159
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,000
When you cringe at someone,

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,780
you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,

161
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,420
just as if if you watch someone fall down the stairs,

162
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,120
you might wince empathetically with their pain.

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
But there's a problem

164
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,360
with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,

165
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,840
or at least a complication,

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
which is that in the purest examples of cringe,

167
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,120
the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed.

168
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,320
In fact, often they're super confident,

169
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,520
and it's actually their lack of self-awareness

170
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,600
about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Like when a woman posts

172
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,280
a ridiculously over-facetuned picture of herself

173
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,780
as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,

174
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,500
or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy

175
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,360
when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,040
So in the internet sense of the word,

177
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,040
cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.

178
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,840
Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,900
and I do feel embarrassed for her,

180
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,320
but she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed.

181
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
You guys are just standing up

182
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,880
because you feel bad that I fell,

183
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,920
and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.

184
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,040
Nothing about this is cringe.

185
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,160
Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.

186
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,800
Maybe she looks back on it, and it's still embarrassing,

187
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,080
but I don't cringe at her.

188
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,460
and cringing with them.

190
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,520
When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her

191
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,140
in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.

192
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,560
My feelings mirror what she's feeling.

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,840
But when I'm cringing at someone,

194
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm feeling something very different

195
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,360
to what they're feeling.

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here

197
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,040
because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.

198
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Another example is bad American Idol auditions,

199
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,160
which are quintessential cringe content.

200
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,400
People try out for American Idol

201
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,680
because they think they're good enough singers

202
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
to compete in a national competition,

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,280
so they're effectively revealing their own delusions

204
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,440
when they show up and sing like this.

205
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,440
♪ Is this the real life or is this just fantasy ♪

206
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,680
It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.

207
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,560
Most of us are bad singers, right?

208
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,720
When people sing Happy Birthday at a party,

209
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,600
usually they're singing in three different keys

210
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,960
at no particular tempo.

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
But that's not cringe because the point

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,520
of singing Happy Birthday is not to sound amazing.

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
Bad American Idol auditions are cringe

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,840
because of the contestants' misplaced confidence.

215
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Who are you as good as, in your opinion?

216
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,600
The lead singer from Queen.

217
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,360
It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,040
when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog.

219
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,620
♪ Frozen, see ♪

220
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,400
I admit that watching Red,

221
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him.

222
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,120
I laugh at his ludicrous performance,

223
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
just like the judges do.

224
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
And because he's so cocky,

225
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,680
and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,

226
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,340
there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys

227
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,220
his failure.

228
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,040
There's almost a sense of karma,

229
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,240
a sense that because of his tragic hubris,

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,840
he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.

231
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,640
And my sense that he deserves it

232
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,160
suppresses my compassionate response,

233
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,080
and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have

234
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,860
about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.

235
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,520
Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant,

236
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,440
Misha, who's there with her mom,

237
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,960
and they both seem like such sweethearts.

238
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I do believe in her talent, very much.

239
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,640
And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,

240
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
but I'm rooting for her,

241
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
and when she embarrasses herself,

242
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe.

243
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,680
♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me ♪

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
Yikes.

245
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,040
My differing reactions to Red and Misha

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,280
track a distinction that Doll makes

247
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,800
between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.

248
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,360
Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification

249
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,120
with the person you're cringing at.

250
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,040
Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves

251
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,560
in the cringeworthy moment,

252
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,420
you still feel the embarrassment they would feel,

253
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,140
or perhaps ought to feel,

254
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,420
if they were aware of how other people were perceiving them.

255
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,580
Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,

256
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,860
involves an emotional distancing

257
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,500
from the person you're cringing at.

258
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,300
Just like with compassionate cringe,

259
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,380
you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,

260
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,260
but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,

261
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,420
you feel annoyance and disgust at them,

262
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,380
and maybe even a little schadenfreude.

263
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,420
So these are actually two very different

264
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,420
emotional responses, vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.

265
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,260
We call both feelings cringe,

266
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,220
not because they're similar feelings,

267
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,820
but because they're responses

268
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,780
to the same type of situation,

269
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,380
people lacking self-awareness embarrassing themselves

270
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,580
without realizing it.

271
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,020
Now embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,

272
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,020
like pretty unpleasant feelings.

273
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,460
So why are we so fascinated by content

274
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,020
that makes us feel this way?

275
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,540
Why do these cringe subreddits

276
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,460
have more than a million members?

277
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,340
Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos

278
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,180
so popular on YouTube?

279
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,420
Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?

280
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,900
Well, I think the answer to that question

281
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,620
depends on whether we're cringing

282
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,900
compassionately or contemptuously.

283
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,540
When I read that Ask Reddit thread

284
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,660
where all the people share their cringe stories,

285
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,300
I cringe compassionately.

286
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,460
That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.

287
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,580
And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity

288
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,180
and camaraderie with them.

289
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,980
I recognize myself in them,

290
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,500
and I'm reassured to hear that other people

291
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,140
are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.

292
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm not the only one who cringes at my past

293
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,060
or at videos of myself.

294
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm not the only one who sometimes says,

295
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,580
you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.

296
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,900
When we collectively laugh at these situations,

297
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,580
we're bonding over our shared human frailty.

298
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,660
We're recognizing that we all say the wrong thing sometimes,

299
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,660
that we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion

300
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,460
only to later educate ourselves

301
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,700
and realize how ignorant and wrong we were,

302
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,340
that we've all tried to present ourselves

303
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,060
as cool and likable, as beautiful and talented and badass,

304
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,460
only to totally miss the mark

305
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,260
and completely embarrass ourselves.

306
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,860
And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity,

307
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,740
our ridiculous pretenses, it makes us feel less alone.

308
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,780
Now this is all, of course,

309
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,260
assuming that we're cringing compassionately.

310
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,660
But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet

311
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,580
does not encourage compassion.

312
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,580
And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact

313
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,300
because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.

314
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,220
This is the 21st century, right?

315
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,820
Pillories and freak shows and public floggings,

316
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,060
these are barbaric practices from the dark ages, right?

317
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,180
Surely no one on the internet would ever

318
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,180
entertain themselves by humiliating people, right?

319
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,620
We've got maniacs!

320
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,060
We've got wackadoos!

321
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,980
We've got schizos, fatties, and spergs!

322
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,380
Come see sexual deviants on display!

323
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,420
That's right, folks, we've got cackling perverts

324
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,740
of every denomination.

325
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,500
Come see the panty sniffer!

326
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,780
He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings!

327
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,420
Come see the skeleton girl!

328
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,380
She hasn't had a bite in 30 days!

329
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,580
That's right, we've got real, live lesbians!

330
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
And I'll be your master of ceremonies.

331
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,340
Half man, half woman, all freak.

332
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,020
Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.

333
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,060
Welcome to the dark side of cringe.

334
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,420
Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture,

335
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,380
and by that I mean there's whole channels making content

336
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,780
that centers the experience of cringing.

337
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,100
And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content,

338
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,060
including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.

339
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,020
I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,

340
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,180
which was the heyday of the Feminist Cringe Compilation,

341
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,580
or SJW Cringe Compilation, remember those?

342
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,860
This is ancient history by YouTube standards,

343
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,060
but in 2016, the word cringe was most associated

344
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,540
with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.

345
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,640
His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video,

346
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,220
which means he would play someone else's content,

347
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,900
then pause it to rant and voiceover about how cringe it is.

348
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,580
♪ No makeup with some sweatpants ♪

349
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,900
Oh my God, it's so fucking bad!

350
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,540
He looks like he's gender fluid,

351
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,380
he looks like a fucking lesbian!

352
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,340
This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,

353
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,060
and it was picked up by a rational herd

354
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,940
of skeptical beasts and free-thinking tuxedos.

355
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,340
What even is this thing?

356
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
It must be one of the 76 genders.

357
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,500
I didn't realize retarded was a gender.

358
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,340
Sorry my dudes, you are on the cringe side of history.

359
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,180
Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.

360
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,240
The logical antelope isn't inviting you

361
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,540
to foster a shared sense of humanity

362
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,140
by recognizing your own weakness

363
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,300
and the embarrassment of screeching feminists.

364
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,220
No, this is an invitation to contempt.

365
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,660
Here's a YouTube video titled

366
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,100
Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.

367
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,180
You'd expect from the title that it would be a video

368
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,640
of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways,

369
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,700
but it isn't.

370
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,260
It's literally just a compilation

371
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,980
of fat people doing things.

372
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,220
This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.

373
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,820
Is this cringe?

374
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,460
What is cringe about it?

375
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,000
Earlier we defined cringe

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,740
as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt

377
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,180
for someone who lacks awareness

378
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,740
about the way others are perceiving them.

379
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,980
But in this video of a swimming fat woman,

380
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,180
there's no context,

381
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,780
so we don't know anything about her mental state.

382
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,180
And we certainly don't know

383
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,900
whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.

384
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,260
If there is an interview where she talks

385
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,740
about how she looks like a supermodel

386
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,700
or if she tried to Photoshop herself

387
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,260
to look like a size four,

388
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,040
okay, maybe that would be cringe.

389
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,380
But that's not what's going on in this clip.

390
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,460
She's just existing in water.

391
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,540
What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?

392
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,020
Presumably something along the lines of,

393
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,900
ew, fat people, gross.

394
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,020
It's literally just disgust, right?

395
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,700
Disgust and contempt for a type of person,

396
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,860
a type of body.

397
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,460
Here's another cringe compilation.

398
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,500
This one titled gender-fluid non-binary cringe.

399
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,180
And we're watching a young teenager

400
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,020
discuss their plans to start vlogging

401
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,140
about their gender-fluid identity.

402
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,060
Honestly, it's kind of terrifying

403
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,060
because gender-fluid people just aren't accepted.

404
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,380
Yeah, apparently not.

405
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,780
And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this

406
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,460
in a cringe compilation,

407
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,540
it seems that the person in this video

408
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,020
was dead on about how people would perceive them.

409
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,940
But despite that self-awareness,

410
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,780
we're being invited to cringe

411
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,020
because I guess being gender-fluid,

412
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,780
like being fat, is cringe in and of itself.

413
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,180
Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.

414
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,960
This is not real cringe, I wanna say.

415
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,920
Cringe has to involve a clash

416
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,640
between self-perception and perception by others.

417
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,140
But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt

418
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,720
is so widespread that there's really no point

419
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
in objecting to it.

420
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,500
If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia,

421
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,480
one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,

422
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,640
you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow,

423
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,760
a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper.

424
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,680
These are subcultures associated

425
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,880
with nerdy social outcasts.

426
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,400
They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online.

427
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,380
I'd like to share with you a list that I put together

428
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,200
of groups that are often considered to be cringe.

429
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,040
Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels,

430
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,840
neckbeards, fedora tippers, gamers, TikTok teens,

431
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
not-like-other-girls girls, fanfic writers,

432
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,720
beat poets, SGWs, feminists, magas,

433
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,680
trans people, non-binary people,

434
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,760
transtrenders, queer AFAB ukulele players,

435
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,620
autistic people, fat people,

436
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,120
the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled.

437
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,840
Now I'm searching for some thread

438
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,640
that all these groups have in common,

439
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
and a handful of themes do jump out.

440
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,340
Deviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.

441
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,080
A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.

442
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,200
The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.

443
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Obsessive interest in unconventional hobbies.

444
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
Low social status.

445
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,700
It's pretty easy to wind up

446
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,560
in the cringe category these days.

447
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,620
If you add up all the groups on this list,

448
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,340
I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.

449
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,140
It includes me three or four times.

450
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm of course a fedora tipping,

451
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,980
queer AFAB ukulele playing TikTok teen.

452
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,020
Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe

453
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,740
and try to be like compassionate or whatever?

454
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,700
Fuck no.

455
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,980
The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.

456
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,620
Oh no, this is social reject battle royale.

457
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,420
Clearly, contemptuous cringing

458
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,700
is rewarding to people in some way,

459
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,020
and I want to explore what the rewards might be.

460
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
Let's start by looking at the role of cringe

461
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,460
in internet politics,

462
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,860
where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.

463
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,220
At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,

464
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,060
you couldn't escape clips of this woman known as Big Red,

465
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,980
a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event

466
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,020
and read off a list of feminist theses

467
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,580
while swearing profusely.

468
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,140
It's part of patriarchy, part of patriarchy.

469
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,460
I don't know if you're noticing a theme, patriarchy.

470
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,260
I'm reading, fuck face.

471
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,660
Mr. Entitled, Mr. Ego, patriarchy, fuck face.

472
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,140
She's one of these people who generates memeable phrases

473
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,340
at an amazing rate.

474
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,200
I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,

475
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,100
but I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia.

476
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,980
Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,

477
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,820
reaction videos, remixes,

478
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,260
and even anti-feminist video essays.

479
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,540
Often Big Red was framed as like the feminist,

480
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,460
the mascot of feminism,

481
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,620
a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists,

482
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,860
which is highly dishonest

483
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,420
considering she's not even a high-profile activist

484
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,260
or thinker.

485
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,820
She was literally some random woman

486
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,140
on the streets of Toronto.

487
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,500
But because of this amusing 12-minute video,

488
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,060
it was insisted upon that we all take a stand

489
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,860
on this random woman who, we were told,

490
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,940
exemplified feminism in its purest form.

491
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,660
I call this strategy mascotization,

492
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,340
the construction of a straw man nemesis.

493
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,100
What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person

494
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,340
and you appoint them the mascot

495
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,180
of an opposing political team.

496
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,260
It's very simple, but very effective.

497
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,780
And it's best paired with memification.

498
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,540
That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,

499
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,620
you freeze it, and you declare

500
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,100
that that moment fully represents a person.

501
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,180
Then, through mascotization,

502
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,500
you declare that this memified person

503
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,820
represents an entire group or movement.

504
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,300
Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester,

505
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,140
You're fucking a white male!

506
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,140
Memified as AIDS Skrillex,

507
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,460
and this protester,

508
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,660
Can't you hate me? I'm a killer!

509
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,620
Can't you hate me? I'm a killer!

510
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,940
who was memified as Drigglypuff.

511
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,260
The two of them symbolized the wretchedness

512
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,300
of beta new male cuckoldry

513
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,220
and the hysteria of social justice crybullies, respectively.

514
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,540
I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,

515
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,940
about whom hundreds of hours

516
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,460
of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.

517
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,900
Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,

518
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,740
as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb-tier casual,

519
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,260
throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.

520
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,100
But other times,

521
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,460
it was almost a super-villainous caricature,

522
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,900
this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype

523
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,980
threatening to confiscate your video games

524
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,860
and engulf you in her eunuch abyss.

525
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,620
Now, it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies

526
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,020
as super-villainous is effective,

527
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,560
though it comes at the risk of backfiring

528
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,660
by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,

529
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,400
a little too badass.

530
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,700
But the subtler strategy of symbolizing

531
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,220
your political enemies not with an evil,

532
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,460
but with a cringe-worthy mascot,

533
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,900
works because it connects with a wide audience

534
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,980
in an intense, emotional way.

535
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,260
Most people have a primal terror

536
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,660
of becoming the target of public ridicule.

537
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,940
And if someone has been made a laughingstock,

538
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,860
it's much safer to take the side

539
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,660
of the people doing the laughing

540
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,440
than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.

541
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,620
To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.

542
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,280
And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,

543
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content

544
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,360
is that our brains want us to learn

545
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,680
how to avoid being laughed at.

546
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,240
When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,

547
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,440
laughing at someone and ridiculing them,

548
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,080
we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.

549
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,400
Don't act like that, or people will laugh at you.

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,040
This is a powerful tool for anyone

551
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,200
who wants to control human behavior.

552
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,120
It's why public humiliation has, in many societies,

553
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,860
been a punishment for criminals.

554
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,660
You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory,

555
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,500
at the whipping post, you see the mob jeering

556
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,340
and throwing rotten vegetables,

557
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,060
and it sends a powerful message.

558
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,840
Don't do whatever that guy did.

559
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,340
I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness

560
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,260
about the fact that the fear of public humiliation

561
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,720
rules us like it's the 17th century.

562
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,860
There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks,

563
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,220
but instead, there's teenage YouTubers

564
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,060
making cringe reaction videos.

565
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,980
There's ex-boyfriends revenge-posting

566
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,300
their girlfriends' nudes.

567
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,180
There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming

568
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,100
just about anyone for alleged breaches of wokeness.

569
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,460
Public humiliation is a powerful force,

570
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,460
and it's usually, it's not a good force,

571
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,500
but there are some rare exceptions.

572
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,280
Back in the Gamergate era, Gamergate itself, of course,

573
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,300
being a study in public humiliation,

574
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,740
slut-shaming on a massive online scale,

575
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,260
YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated

576
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,780
by anti-feminism.

577
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,420
As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks,

578
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,420
and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers

579
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,640
who were constantly mobbed and harassed.

580
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,000
What I see as one of the turning points

581
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,420
in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days

582
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,980
to the left-tube world of today

583
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
was a handful of videos uploaded

584
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,540
by then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis,

585
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,140
in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual

586
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,100
called Davis Aurini.

587
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,260
Come on, Davis, we have to,

588
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,660
no, stop lecturing me about ethics,

589
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,500
we have to get out of here,

590
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,740
and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?

591
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,940
In his YouTube videos,

592
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,980
Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women

593
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
while posing in front of a toy skull

594
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,040
and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.

595
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,140
Men of the West, women in our culture

596
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,700
have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

597
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,140
And so in discussing sluts versus whores,

598
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,580
I would start with the premise

599
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,340
that all women are whores.

600
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views,

601
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,220
and a fairly positive response

602
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,700
even from a mostly male gamer audience,

603
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,540
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.

604
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,340
Why did these videos work with this audience

605
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,060
where so many others didn't?

606
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,380
Well, I think it's because Harry

607
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,940
didn't moralistically call out Davis

608
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,900
for being problematic or misogynistic.

609
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,180
Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact

610
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,160
that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.

611
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,780
And Davis was a perfect target

612
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,620
because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.

613
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
He had no self-awareness about the fact

614
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,580
that pretty much everyone saw through his absurd posturing

615
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,700
as a badass tough guy by day,

616
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,060
profoundly dark philosopher by night.

617
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,420
We exist in a world with feminized legislation.

618
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,100
I've spoken to men and boys who've told me

619
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,060
that Harry's videos inspired

620
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,620
the beginning of a feminist awakening in them,

621
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,380
not just because they cringed at Davis Arrini,

622
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,740
but also because they recognized

623
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,340
a little bit of Davis in themselves,

624
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,200
and they cringed at that too.

625
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,500
Recognizing part of yourself in a cringe-worthy person

626
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,780
induces self-cringe, which can motivate you

627
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,980
to change your behavior, your beliefs,

628
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,240
or even your own self-concept.

629
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,220
And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance

630
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,140
of a recognizable stock character on the internet,

631
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,060
namely the fedora tipper,

632
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,220
basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader

633
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,060
for traditional masculinity,

634
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,220
but who's basically just a pasty nerd

635
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,420
who can't relate to women.

636
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,860
Davis was such an extreme version of this,

637
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,260
and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments

638
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,660
so frequently that I would classify him

639
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,860
as what the internet calls a lolcow.

640
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,100
Lolcow is old 4chan lingo.

641
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,540
It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric

642
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,020
or foolish behavior can be milked for lols.

643
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,300
Milking in this context can mean

644
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,500
simply watching a lolcow's behavior and laughing at them,

645
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,360
or it can mean making reaction videos

646
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,640
where you make fun of them,

647
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,300
or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them

648
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,940
to get a response that you find entertaining.

649
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,100
I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,

650
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,300
or my old videos about the Golden One,

651
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,820
as lolcow milking content with a political angle.

652
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,300
It was essentially an argument from ridicule,

653
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,940
an argument from cringe,

654
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,900
with the aim of convincing people,

655
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,660
don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs,

656
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,660
but also, and I'll just speak for myself here,

657
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,860
I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer,

658
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,620
and I wanted people to laugh.

659
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,420
There doesn't need to be a political agenda

660
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,960
behind milking lolcows, in fact, usually, there isn't.

661
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,780
The purest example of a lolcow I can think of

662
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,160
is actually someone from way before the internet,

663
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,340
namely Florence Foster Jenkins.

664
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,300
Jenkins, or Lady Florence, as she liked to be called,

665
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,220
was an American soprano who attracted a cult following

666
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,500
in New York City during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,

667
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,580
due to her being such a terrible singer

668
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,260
that people went to her concerts essentially for the lols.

669
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,340
She was described as the world's worst opera singer.

670
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,960
No one, before or since, has succeeded

671
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,420
in liberating themselves quite so completely

672
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,820
from the shackles of musical notation.

673
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,840
Behold this fucking camp queen.

674
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Oh, we have no choice but to stan.

675
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made.

676
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Ah!

677
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
Ah!

678
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
Ah!

679
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,040
Ah!

680
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,860
Cringe.

681
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,840
She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,

682
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,240
the William Hung of her age.

683
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,040
Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence

684
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,640
until 1944, when she was 76 years old

685
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,200
and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert

686
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,500
to which newspaper critics showed up.

687
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,720
The next morning, the New York Sun reported,

688
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,040
much of her singing was hopelessly lacking

689
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,040
in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was

690
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,680
from its proper elevation,

691
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,400
the more the audience laughed and applauded.

692
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,760
And five days later, she had a heart attack and died.

693
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,920
I find something very touching about this story.

694
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,840
I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone

695
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,

696
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,160
but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.

697
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,400
It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty

698
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,040
of Simon Cowell, at least he tries to stop these people

699
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,440
before things get out of hand.

700
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,480
I think it's normal to have mixed feelings

701
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,560
about a lolcow.

702
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,160
Like, yes, this is hilarious, but on the other hand,

703
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,880
doth not a lolcow bleed?

704
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,720
On some level, we know it's wrong

705
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,040
to entertain ourselves this way,

706
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,560
but on the other hand,

707
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,200
other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.

708
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,960
There's a good book about this called The Joy of Pain,

709
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,600
Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature

710
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,720
by Richard Smith.

711
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,040
Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take

712
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,480
in other people's misery,

713
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,800
and Smith argues that we experience it

714
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,560
because psychologically, we gain something

715
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,880
when other people lose.

716
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,400
We're constantly evaluating our own worth

717
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,720
by comparing ourselves to other people,

718
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,480
so we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,

719
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,040
a pleasant feeling of superiority,

720
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,760
from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,

721
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,160
especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.

722
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,880
Maybe I'm not perfect, but at least I'm not this lolcow.

723
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
And we also get a boost when people who are socially

724
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,800
above us, whom we envy, get brought down a peg.

725
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,880
James Charles' canceled party lolol.

726
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,920
I think Schadenfreude basically accounts

727
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,120
for just a huge percentage of the things

728
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,280
that happen on YouTube.com.

729
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,240
Smith uses the word humilitainment for this type of media,

730
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,520
like reality TV shows designed to produce

731
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,800
spectacular moments of embarrassment.

732
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,000
YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,

733
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,280
or some kind of carnival sideshow.

734
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,280
Take a look around you.

735
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,400
We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who,

736
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
at the time I'm making this video,

737
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
remains apparently in total denial

738
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,440
about her eating disorder and continues to make videos

739
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,880
modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.

740
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,600
We have Wings of Redemption, a bad-tempered gamer

741
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,080
who for a long time was essentially confined

742
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,320
by poverty, obesity, and depression

743
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,160
to streaming video games all day

744
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,800
to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him.

745
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,600
We have Onision, a habitual allege,

746
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
abuser of women and teenage girls,

747
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,960
who earlier this year essentially performed

748
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,240
his own mental breakdown on YouTube

749
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,080
after Patreon banned him for doxing an accuser.

750
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,400
I love kombucha!

751
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,040
Woo, woo, woo, woo!

752
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,620
Whose idea was it to give hundreds

753
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,040
of pathological narcissists access to video equipment?

754
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,160
What kind of sick social experiment are we living in?

755
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,040
And the viewers are no better than the performers.

756
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,520
Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick.

757
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,920
Oh, you people love nothing more

758
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,720
than to watch one of us poor, helpless egomaniacs

759
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,080
completely lose our minds live on camera.

760
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,680
Is this what you want, huh?

761
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,080
Is this what, you wanna total meltdown?

762
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,480
You know, as a creator, you have to be aware

763
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,800
that you're a circus performer,

764
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,940
and the crowd may in fact be more entertained

765
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,660
if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers.

766
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,760
Online media today is full of Lady Florences,

767
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,280
anti-celebrities with anti-fans.

768
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,420
To be clear, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

769
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,920
with indulging now and then

770
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,720
in a little bit of light contempt.

771
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
Cringing at Davis or Rini or bad American Idol auditions

772
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,460
seems pretty harmless, but it can be taken too far,

773
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,760
and there's no better case study of taking it too far

774
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,520
than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler.

775
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,840
If you don't know what's coming,

776
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,320
you might wanna strap in, gorge,

777
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,880
because this is coconuts.

778
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
It's bananas.

779
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
It's a full fruit salad.

780
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,640
God, how do I even begin to explain this?

781
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,760
Well, Christine Weston Chandler,

782
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,840
more commonly known on the internet as Chris-Chan,

783
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,720
is the victim of what is quite possibly

784
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,440
the longest-running and most obsessive

785
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,000
internet trolling saga of all time.

786
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,880
She's the lolcow of lolcows.

787
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Hello, everybody, this is Christine Chandler

788
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,020
coming to you live from home once again.

789
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,060
Chandler is an autistic trans woman,

790
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,540
and yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,

791
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,580
which I paused to explain

792
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,420
because I don't think I've ever seen anyone

793
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,660
actually take her transition seriously.

794
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,060
Most people seem to regard it

795
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,460
as simply another absurd symptom

796
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,300
of her hilarious mental condition.

797
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,660
In fact, a bunch of trans people

798
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,900
will probably get real salty with me

799
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,500
for making trans people look bad

800
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,020
by including Chris-Chan in our, oh,

801
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,500
our very prestigious and exclusive club.

802
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,340
Oh, please.

803
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,660
Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty.

804
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,740
This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.

805
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,100
God, how did trannies get so snobbish?

806
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,420
Look, is Chris-Chan really trans?

807
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,660
I don't know, and I don't care.

808
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,220
If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman,

809
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,260
I for one support her journey.

810
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,300
But it doesn't matter.

811
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,180
The relevant thing about Chris-Chan is not Chris-Chan.

812
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,340
It's the fact that for the last 13 years,

813
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,740
nearly every aspect of her life

814
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,380
has been obsessively archived online

815
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,540
by thousands of voyeurs known as Christorians.

816
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,980
Chancellor first acquired this anti-fandom

817
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,720
several internet centuries ago, back in 2007,

818
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,620
when 4chan took notice of her comic book series Sonichu,

819
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,340
a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu.

820
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,640
The comic is set in Quickville,

821
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,300
CWC being Chris-Chan's initials.

822
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,260
The protagonist is a self-insert

823
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,820
who references Chandler's real-life quote, love quest

824
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,340
to find a quote, boyfriend-free girl,

825
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,140
which apparently involved posting bizarre attraction signs

826
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,940
around her community college.

827
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,340
For this story to make sense, you have to keep in mind

828
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,580
that Chandler identified and presented as male until 2015.

829
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,260
So these trolls saw her as like,

830
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,860
the ultimate autistic incel man-child.

831
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,740
Just to give you a feel for this person,

832
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
here's Christine in 2018,

833
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,460
holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait,

834
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,980
note the Sonichu medallions.

835
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,720
Here's the bedroom she lived in,

836
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,580
and here she is in recent years,

837
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,720
giving us a full BronyCon eleganza.

838
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,180
Pegasister snapped.

839
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,820
Basically, she's the entire Cringetopia subreddit

840
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,660
condensed into a single person.

841
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,340
So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit,

842
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,820
because of course they did,

843
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,420
and they began tormenting her

844
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,060
by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,

845
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,780
posting candid photos of her, et cetera.

846
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,580
Chandler reacted to the trolls,

847
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,700
which of course encouraged them more,

848
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,980
and the harassment escalated and escalated.

849
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,100
They hacked her accounts,

850
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,420
or tricked her into giving out passwords,

851
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,460
they posted all her emails online,

852
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,060
they showed up in person and photographed her house,

853
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,220
they called her parents,

854
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,300
posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers,

855
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,420
in order to extract as much information

856
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,620
about her as possible.

857
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,280
And of course, they contacted Chandler herself,

858
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,380
which was very rewarding for trolls,

859
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,300
because she has no filter,

860
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,060
and was very naive and trusting.

861
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,020
So she was very willing to divulge,

862
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,300
or easily manipulated into divulging,

863
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,900
mortifying information about herself.

864
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,580
Sexual, psychological, scatological,

865
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,180
there's not really any limits or boundaries to this.

866
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,900
For all the information they gathered,

867
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,060
the trolls created a wiki, called the Quickie,

868
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,440
devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris-Chan data.

869
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,620
It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,

870
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,660
entire articles about all members

871
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,860
of her immediate and extended family,

872
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,540
pages of psychiatric records she was tricked

873
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,900
into sending them, and that's only the beginning.

874
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,280
In their more grandiose moods,

875
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,620
the Christorians have speculated that Chris-Chan

876
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,260
is the most documented life in all human history,

877
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,060
comparing their social experitainment to the Truman Show.

878
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,880
It's a level of obsession that surpasses

879
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,660
the wildest excesses of Stan culture.

880
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,340
It's a gaze into the abyss that does not blink.

881
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,860
Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,

882
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,340
or on one occasion, sex workers, to the Chandler household.

883
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,240
Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates

884
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,340
with Chris-Chan, of course, secretly wearing wires

885
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,080
to record their conversations.

886
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,020
Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends

887
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,180
so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.

888
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,900
These things must be archived, don't you understand?

889
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,380
Chris-Chan must be documented.

890
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,580
The absolute low point came when some trolls

891
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,580
encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl

892
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,540
and have phone sex with Chris-Chan and record it.

893
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,780
In other words, they groomed a child

894
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,860
to deceive an autistic person into performing sex acts

895
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,340
for their entertainment.

896
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,900
Now, to contemporary Christorians,

897
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,400
this sort of sadistic interference in Christine's life

898
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,460
is frowned upon.

899
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,260
Not so much because it's immoral,

900
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,940
so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,

901
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,500
a bit attention-seeking.

902
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,100
No, to the sophisticated Christorian,

903
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,460
the real pleasure in all this is supposed to lie

904
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,460
in quietly spectating, savoring the fine notes of cringe.

905
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,380
Now, I take it I don't even need to comment

906
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,740
on the morality of all this.

907
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,580
The real question to me is why?

908
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,180
Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession

909
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,980
with Christine Chandler?

910
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,740
And yes, it is an obsession.

911
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,140
Just to give you a sense of a single individual's

912
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,280
personal investment in this, the YouTuber Gino Samuel,

913
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,140
one of very few Christorians with the audacity

914
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,500
to show his face, has been working for more than two years

915
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,020
to produce an eventual 100-episode documentary series

916
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,420
about the life of Chris-Chan.

917
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,100
Gino has completed 36 episodes so far,

918
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,620
and each episode is around 40 minutes long,

919
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,460
meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video

920
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,060
about the life of what is essentially a random stranger.

921
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,900
I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.

922
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,220
I'll call it morbid cringe,

923
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,420
defined as an obsessive and addictive

924
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,900
contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group.

925
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,380
Why does morbid cringe happen?

926
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,940
Well, I've spent some time

927
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,100
poring over Christorians' conversations with each other,

928
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,740
and I've even interrogated a couple of them,

929
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,340
and this is what I've found.

930
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,580
The first thing they'll tell you

931
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,140
is that they just think it's funny and entertaining,

932
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,520
that Christine's strange life and mind

933
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,420
simply appeals to their morbid curiosity,

934
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,340
and I'm sure that's true.

935
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,020
But a lot of things are funny and entertaining

936
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,740
and morbidly interesting.

937
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,540
Why fixate on this particular person?

938
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Well, for a lot of them, it's a reassurance

939
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,820
that there's someone out there worse than them.

940
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,600
Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,

941
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,200
but at least this defenseless punching bag called Chris-chan

942
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,460
is here for them to assert their superiority over.

943
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,500
It's pretty much common knowledge

944
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,280
that a lot of Christorians,

945
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
including some of the most vocal haters,

946
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,620
are autistic themselves.

947
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,660
And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris-chan

948
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,980
is that she's giving autistics a bad name.

949
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,980
In recent years, there's also been a small contingent

950
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,180
of transgender trolls who are likewise prone to say,

951
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,540
he's not a real transgender like me

952
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,020
and he's making us all look bad.

953
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh yeah, because people who troll Chris-chan,

954
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,620
you guys look amazing.

955
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,420
It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this

956
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,180
about why trolling Chandler is justified, righteous even,

957
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,020
because at the end of the day, trolls are people too.

958
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,660
And a lot of them actually do

959
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,980
have a guilty conscience about this,

960
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,620
which they suppress by insisting

961
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,380
that Chris-chan is a horrible person

962
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,380
who deserves to be tormented.

963
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
But trolls who protest too much

964
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,660
about the evils of Chris-chan,

965
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,940
and therefore reveal the excess

966
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,400
of their emotional investment in this,

967
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,500
are known in the community as A-logs.

968
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,700
A-log is the name of a troll

969
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,260
who attracted the ire of other trolls

970
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,140
by ranting about Chris-chan's crimes,

971
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,300
comparing her to Hitler,

972
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,600
and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.

973
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,800
Among the trolls, this kind of behavior

974
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,540
is considered an embarrassment to all of them

975
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,100
because they want to feel like they're just cruelly

976
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,380
and casually toying with this person.

977
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,300
You know, just for laughs.

978
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,260
Not a big deal.

979
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,260
This is all perfectly healthy, and normal, and fine.

980
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,080
It's fine.

981
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,660
But A-log gave the lie to that illusion

982
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,020
because it was obvious that his Chris-chan obsession

983
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,380
wasn't healthy, or normal, or fine.

984
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,380
So the other trolls turned on A-log,

985
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,900
and they made him into Chris-chan 2.0,

986
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,820
and they uncovered his autism,

987
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,740
and his furry porn collection,

988
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,520
and his cringy, erotic fan fiction.

989
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,020
So why would someone as similar to Chris-chan as A-log

990
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,820
obsessively hate on her?

991
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,980
Well, there's two explanations.

992
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,300
One is troll-shielding.

993
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,900
That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris-chan

994
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,000
and spearheaded the trolling efforts

995
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,900
in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls.

996
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,160
The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob

997
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,900
by waving your pitchfork the hardest.

998
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,440
Obviously, this did not work.

999
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,400
The other explanation is that A-log saw himself

1000
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,480
reflected in Chris-chan,

1001
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,680
and sort of projected his own shame

1002
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,200
and self-contempt onto her.

1003
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,680
A-log hated Chris-chan because he saw part of himself

1004
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,240
in her, and the other trolls hated A-log

1005
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,300
because they saw part of themselves in him.

1006
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,640
To quote Margaret Pless,

1007
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,400
who covered this story for New York Magazine

1008
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,440
a few years ago,

1009
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,280
I think it might be A-log's all the way down.

1010
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,400
People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-chan

1011
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
because to them she's a symbol

1012
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,680
of something they hate about themselves,

1013
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,120
something they're ashamed of.

1014
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,520
Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum,

1015
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,000
or being a socially awkward recluse.

1016
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,800
Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents,

1017
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,520
or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons,

1018
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,120
or embarrassing sexual proclivities,

1019
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,720
or all of the above.

1020
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,180
This is how scapegoating works, right?

1021
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,760
You repress your uncomfortable feelings

1022
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,120
of shame and insecurity and self-loathing,

1023
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,220
and you displace them onto someone else,

1024
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,060
usually someone you can feel superior to.

1025
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,340
Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat,

1026
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,840
transforming your painful shame and self-loathing

1027
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,280
into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.

1028
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,420
It's pretty safe to assume that a large percentage

1029
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,300
of Christorians and trolls

1030
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,020
are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris-chan.

1031
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,340
So bonding together over their shared contempt

1032
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,620
for Chris-chan is a way of processing the shame and anxiety

1033
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,800
of social rejection and exclusion.

1034
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,620
And I think for a lot of people, even normal people

1035
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,420
who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,

1036
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,980
contemptuous cringing helps us cope

1037
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,220
with our own shame and insecurity.

1038
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,060
Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious empathizing

1039
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,420
with other people and find a way to make this all about me.

It's very that.

1052
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,180
I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.

1053
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,980
Cringe is failed seriousness.

1054
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,920
In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am

1055
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,960
of being a transgender lesbian.

1056
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,840
Cringe.

1057
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,760
Shame.

1058
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,720
At the end of that video,

1059
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,080
I talk about how I sense that my shame

1060
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,040
is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel

1061
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,040
for a lot of other trans lesbians,

1062
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,240
particularly those of the heck-and-stripey-sock-nya-nya

1063
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,600
catgirl variety.

1064
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,000
But I confess to periodically sinking

1065
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,640
into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing

1066
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,560
at embarrassing trans lesbians.

1067
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,940
I want to return to that thought

1068
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,960
and kind of psychoanalyze myself

1069
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,200
as a kind of first-person case study

1070
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,860
of a morbid cringe obsession.

1071
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,640
So, catgirl trans girls are,

1072
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,860
okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.

1073
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,600
They're trans women, usually attracted to women,

1074
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,600
who express their identity online

1075
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,600
through cloying, neotenous, otaku memery.

1076
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,280
And my conscious reason for cringing at them

1077
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,560
is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls

1078
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,160
as a kind of visual baby talk,

1079
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,920
an infantilized and unrealistic representation

1080
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,840
of femininity and womanhood

1081
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,600
that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.

1082
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,280
So when trans women identify with it, I cringe.

1083
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,040
Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily.

1084
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,320
Fuck your dreams.

1085
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,280
Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked

1086
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,320
with a discussion of whether my opinions

1087
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,680
about catgirls are fair or correct.

1088
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,720
So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.

1089
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.

1090
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,560
Listen to the contempt beneath my words.

1091
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,840
Because even if everything I'm saying is true,

1092
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,880
catgirls are being cringe online

1093
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,640
is a situation so inconsequential

1094
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,560
that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much.

1095
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,440
So why do I have this cringe fixation?

1096
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,000
Well, according to the A-log theory of morbid cringing,

1097
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,720
we form obsessive and addictive contempt

1098
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,280
for people who have traits in common with us,

1099
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,160
people who make us uncomfortable

1100
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,880
because we see something of ourselves in them.

1101
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,560
So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?

1102
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,320
Well, we're both trans women.

1103
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,960
We're both attracted to women.

1104
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,920
I do like anime, but I don't like the anime they like, okay?

1105
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,280
I like good anime that has mature,

1106
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,040
three-dimensional female characters.

1107
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,520
Look, I'm a real transgender, okay?

1108
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,480
I'm not like you.

1109
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,320
It's also not lost on me that this is like

1110
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,960
the seventh time on this channel

1111
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,080
I've dressed as a catgirl to make fun of them.

1112
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,640
I have posted cringe.

1113
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,520
You should all be laughing at me right now.

1114
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,800
Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.

1115
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,960
So I do think there's some truth to the idea

1116
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,840
that I'm A-logging these catgirls.

1117
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,760
I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.

1118
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,720
Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe

1119
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,480
at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,

1120
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
because of how these catgirls are acting.

1121
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,960
So let's make another distinction

1122
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,880
between in-group cringe and out-group cringe.

1123
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,680
In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone

1124
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,080
who belongs to the same group identity as you,

1125
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,960
for example, your family, your romantic partnership,

1126
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,680
your ethnicity, or your country,

1127
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,040
particularly if they're embarrassing themselves

1128
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,200
in front of outsiders to the group.

1129
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,760
Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets

1130
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,520
if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends.

1131
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,120
Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get

1132
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,320
when we talk to foreigners

1133
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,040
about Donald Trump being our president.

1134
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,440
Or think about these phrases.

1135
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,680
She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.

1136
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,720
They're making trans people look bad.

1137
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,200
He's giving autistics a bad name.

1138
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,400
When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,

1139
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,800
we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment,

1140
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
we feel embarrassment,

1141
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,280
because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too.

1142
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,080
So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,

1143
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,260
because you're cringing at your membership

1144
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,060
in an embarrassing group.

1145
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,260
Nothing has ever triggered

1146
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,860
this kind of in-group embarrassment more for me

1147
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,660
than a cringe video that went viral last year

1148
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,900
in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum

1149
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,460
over being misgendered in a GameStop.

1150
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,020
You're gonna give me my fucking money back.

1151
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,980
Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.

1152
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,900
Excuse me, it's ma'am.

1153
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,180
It is ma'am.

1154
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,700
This video is excruciating for me to watch.

1155
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,420
Motherfucker, take it outside.

1156
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,740
If you wanna call me sir again,

1157
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,980
I will show you a fucking sir.

1158
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,820
Motherfucker.

1159
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,300
The paradoxical absurdity

1160
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,980
of trying to brutishly intimidate people

1161
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,720
into seeing you as a woman.

1162
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,820
Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this

1163
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,060
and say Natalie hates trans women who don't pass.

1164
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,100
But passing is really not what this is about.

1165
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,020
It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior

1166
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,420
from a trans woman accompanied by

1167
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,100
apparently total delusion about how she's presenting.

1168
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,980
Well, I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time

1169
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,780
to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not.

1170
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,780
It's really not that clear, Gorge.

1171
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,100
And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?

1172
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,820
The incongruity between her thinking

1173
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,500
that she's serving women

1174
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,740
while bellowing like a drill sergeant.

1175
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,380
By the way, what I'm doing right now,

1176
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,180
this is cringe reaction content.

1177
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,540
I don't really do that on this channel,

1178
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,460
but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.

1179
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,820
And it feels good, like intoxicatingly good.

1180
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,980
I can see how you could get addicted to this.

1181
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,580
I'm imagining myself right now surrounded by cis people

1182
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,780
and I am leading the righteous mob

1183
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,780
as we point and laugh at some delusional manly dump truck.

1184
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,260
I am a real transgender, a true transgender,

1185
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,820
a good transgender.

1186
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,860
Father finally approves of me.

1187
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,780
This would be the unconscious archetypal father.

1188
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,940
Jot that down in my progress notes, please, doctor.

1189
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,720
Okay, so why does this feel so good?

1190
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,060
Well, let me talk you through my feelings.

1191
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,940
When I watched that GameStop video,

1192
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,380
for the first few seconds,

1193
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,660
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.

1194
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,860
I can even relate,

1195
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,200
because in the first couple months of my transition,

1196
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,540
there was an occasion

1197
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,740
where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction

1198
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,100
where the guy at the desk was calling me sir the entire time.

1199
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,740
And there's something very humiliating

1200
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,660
about trying to present female,

1201
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,420
like wearing a dress and makeup,

1202
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,420
and yet being called sir.

1203
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,340
It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept

1204
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,980
and the way other people are seeing you.

1205
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,100
And the memory of it is painful to me,

1206
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,900
but what I cling to is that,

1207
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,100
while I may have looked like a man,

1208
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,700
at least I didn't act like a man.

1209
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,340
I didn't threaten to take anyone outside

1210
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,780
and show them a sir.

1211
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,100
In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy.

1212
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,620
So as the GameStop video progresses,

1213
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,460
my sympathy runs out fast.

1214
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,340
And instead of compassionate cringe,

1215
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,420
I feel group embarrassment for trans women,

1216
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,500
including myself.

1217
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,180
And I feel contempt toward this individual

1218
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,780
for making us all look bad.

1219
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,100
I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear.

1220
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,720
What if I'm as delusional as that trans woman?

1221
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,680
I don't look and sound like that, do I?

1222
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,700
I feel like I have to do a sanity check.

1223
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,840
I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,

1224
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,620
listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure.

1225
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,420
And that fear motivates me to distance myself

1226
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,920
from that person in the video.

1227
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,520
I don't feel compassion for her,

1228
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,360
because that would mean putting myself

1229
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,000
in her size 16 shoes.

1230
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,480
And I don't want to do that,

1231
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,760
because I'm horrified and repulsed by the thought

1232
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,880
that I'm like her in some way.

1233
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,440
So I want to push away.

1234
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,800
And contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself.

1235
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,480
And if I express that contempt by publicly shaming

1236
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,680
and condemning her,

1237
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,360
then I'm also socially distancing myself.

1238
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,040
Accidental COVID jokes.

1239
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,880
Oops.

1240
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,080
Guess it's, uh, contagious.

1241
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,040
I think many people who are stigmatized

1242
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,640
or who have been humiliated long

1243
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,240
for the experience of being a normal,

1244
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,440
surrounded by fellow normals,

1245
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,040
judging and humiliating a freak.

1246
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,160
And if you take a look around trans YouTube,

1247
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,800
a lot of the biggest creators in the platform

1248
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,200
have channels basically devoted

1249
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,060
to exactly this type of cringe-reaction humilitainment.

1250
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,320
The YouTuber Calvin Guerra is a trans guy

1251
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,240
who's best known for what are essentially

1252
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,920
cringe-reaction videos,

1253
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,240
mostly aimed at people he deems trans-trenders.

1254
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,520
That is, people who claim to be trans,

1255
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,600
but who aren't real transgenders like Calvin.

1256
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,720
He's especially bothered by girly, AFAB,

1257
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,720
trans and non-binary teenagers,

1258
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,760
or by anyone who blurs the line

1259
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,640
between lesbian and trans-masculine identities.

1260
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,360
Sometimes he'll do a long-form reaction

1261
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,760
to a specific person who grinds his gears.

1262
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,680
So this person is an asexual, non-binary,

1263
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,680
transgender lesbian who uses he, they, it, thons pronouns.

1264
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,640
According to my calculations, you are a trans-trender.

1265
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,560
And other times he'll basically just laugh

1266
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,800
at cringy trans TikTok teens.

1267
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,120
No, no, I'm turning off the video.

1268
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,440
I can't watch this.

1269
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,200
He has a couple justifications for making these videos.

1270
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,440
One is that he's actually helping

1271
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,840
the people he's cringing at,

1272
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,780
because if a trender transitions,

1273
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,420
then they'll get dysphoria and have to detransition.

1274
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,820
But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people

1275
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,460
really help them figure out whether they're trans or not?

1276
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,740
His other justification is that trans-trenders

1277
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,180
are giving real trans people a bad name.

1278
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,100
They're the reason people are transphobic.

1279
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,860
This is why they hate us.

1280
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,300
It's because of the trenders.

1281
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,940
Wow, I love that idea of a true-scum furry.

1282
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,700
Isn't that just, isn't that just wonderful?

1283
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,820
A true-scum furry!

1284
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,100
But it's not, though.

1285
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,580
I mean, transphobia existed long before

1286
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,460
there were people you could plausibly describe

1287
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,700
as trans-trenders.

1288
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,660
So trans-trenders aren't the reason

1289
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,780
society hates trans people, Calvin.

1290
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,740
They're the reason you hate trans people, right?

1291
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,260
Or at least the trans community.

1292
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,060
And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting

1293
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,740
that feeling onto society at large,

1294
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,020
and you're saying, oh, this is the reason

1295
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,340
people are transphobic.

1296
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,020
And to be fair, I get that it's not just a projection.

1297
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,100
Like back in 2016, the SJW cringe era,

1298
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,420
it was cis people mocking trans people

1299
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,700
with all these tropes.

1300
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,620
Attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders,

1301
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,820
special snowflakes.

1302
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,980
But now, they're used by trans people

1303
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,740
trying to distance themselves,

1304
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,140
trying to ghettoize the most laughed-at people

1305
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,940
in the community under the label of trans-trenders.

1306
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,500
And Calvin, there may be some truth

1307
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,780
to what you're saying about there being confused teenagers

1308
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,500
who think they're trans when they're not.

1309
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,460
I mean, I wouldn't know.

1310
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,500
I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life,

1311
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,860
and I don't hang out with teenagers.

1312
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,420
But even if it is true, Calvin,

1313
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,600
your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me.

1314
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,520
Like, you return to this topic to cringe again,

1315
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,200
and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.

1316
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,240
It's like you're picking at a wound.

1317
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,840
It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession.

1318
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,360
And I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you.

1319
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,060
This could be me projecting, of course,

1320
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,180
but I wonder if the way you feel

1321
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,800
about girly, sparkle-gender AFABs

1322
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,680
is similar to the way I feel

1323
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,400
about otaku, trans-bian cat girls.

1324
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,760
And it might be worth considering that

1325
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,400
I don't cringe at the sparkle-genders the way you do.

1326
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,000
I mean, I'm with you on wondering

1327
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,320
what a he-they-zeer-gender-flux-lesbian-demi-boy is,

1328
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,880
but unlike you, Calvin,

1329
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,140
I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession

1330
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,040
with feminine AFAB trans people.

1331
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,840
They can identify as however many genders

1332
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,080
they want for all I care.

1333
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,640
I may not always understand it,

1334
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,840
but I support their journey.

1335
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,360
I guess it doesn't bother me,

1336
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,000
because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me

1337
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,520
because of how they behave.

1338
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,200
I don't feel in-group cringe.

1339
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,280
Now it's a different story.

1340
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,440
If I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit

1341
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,200
and I see a comment like,

1342
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,760
pre-transition trans-lesbian here.

1343
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,280
I wish I had titties.

1344
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,920
Girl, dick, nya nya.

1345
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,600
Get the fuck out of here, Billy.

1346
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,000
You're giving real trans-lesbians a bad name.

1347
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,560
This is why they hate us.

1348
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,080
See, now I have strong feelings.

1349
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,160
Now I'm in-group cringing.

1350
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,760
And intellectually, I do think my feelings are correct

1351
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,720
to some extent.

1352
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,600
Like, I don't think a general lesbian community

1353
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,500
is the appropriate forum for a trans woman

1354
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,980
who's effectively still living as a man

1355
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,980
to take the mic and whine about wanting titties

1356
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,100
or rhapsodize about girl dick.

1357
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,780
But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this

1358
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:29,180
because of my own dysphoria and my own shame.

1359
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,780
And honestly, my own self-loathing.

1360
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,400
Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps

1361
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,100
because I feel like a fake woman

1362
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,300
imposing myself on real women.

1363
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,420
That's where my head is at.

1364
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,160
So where does this pre-transition trans-lesbian

1365
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,600
get the audacity?

1366
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,440
You know, it makes me feel in-group cringe

1367
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,280
about an identity, trans-lesbianism,

1368
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,880
which for me is already a pain point of insecurity

1369
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,760
and embarrassment and shame.

1370
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,320
So Calvin, maybe, and again, I could just be projecting,

1371
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,280
but maybe that's kind of like

1372
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,140
how you feel about these trenders.

1373
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,880
When you make these videos condemning them

1374
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,540
as not really trans, aren't you essentially exiling them

1375
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,140
from the in-group so you no longer feel the pain

1376
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,560
of in-group cringe?

1377
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,580
Or perhaps, Calvin Garrah,

1378
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,040
what you're really trying to destroy

1379
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,120
is the trender within.

1380
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,920
And again, I could be full of shit here.

1381
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,080
At the end of the day,

1382
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,200
this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met.

1383
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,760
So feel free to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin,

1384
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,560
but still, I guess I invite you to consider

1385
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,800
whether producing trans-trender humilitainment

1386
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,640
is actually helping anything

1387
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,540
or whether it's really just an addictive way

1388
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,240
to scratch some kind of emotional itch.

1389
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,520
All right, I've said my piece about Calvin.

1390
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,360
Who's next?

1391
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,120
Oh, how about Vanessa?

1392
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,680
We meet again, gorge.

1393
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,000
And once again, I'm wearing some kind

1394
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,040
of embarrassing anime hairpiece.

1395
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,600
Vanessa is a trans woman who is

1396
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,760
the second most popular political trans YouTuber.

1397
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,560
At least that's what I wrote in the script

1398
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,240
when I had more subscribers than her

1399
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,520
and was fully prepared to be a cunt about it,

1400
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,640
but since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again.

1401
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,680
Good for her.

1402
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,680
Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel

1403
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,960
back when SJW cringe was fashionable.

1404
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,280
She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,

1405
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,820
but the most consistent theme was trans-trenders

1406
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,240
and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name.

1407
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,640
They're making us look bad.

1408
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,440
This is why people hate us.

1409
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,080
So what we can now recognize

1410
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,680
as a standard in-group cringe fixation.

1411
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,360
But Vanessa focused in particular

1412
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,400
on a strident, SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis.

1413
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,880
And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her

1414
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,600
where she made a point of misgendering Riley

1415
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,880
and dismissing her as a fake transgender

1416
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,240
who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to.

1417
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,120
You know, if you went on estrogen,

1418
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,480
your sex drive wouldn't be so high

1419
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,840
and you wouldn't be guilt-tripping people

1420
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
into having sex with you.

1421
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,680
Just saying.

1422
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,480
Then, Riley made a video revealing

1423
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,120
that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year

1424
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,480
and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery.

1425
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,480
This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video

1426
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,760
where she not only apologized to Riley

1427
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,400
and acknowledged her transition,

1428
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,480
but she actually went beyond the script

1429
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,200
of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube video

1430
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,280
and opened up about having experienced herself

1431
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,560
the cruelty she directed at Riley.

1432
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,280
And I'm someone who's had my transition

1433
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,800
picked apart online.

1434
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,000
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads

1435
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,800
with hundreds of comments on it

1436
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,720
of people trying to prove that I'm not trans

1437
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,480
because I haven't done this or that

1438
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,080
or, you know, digging up my old pictures.

1439
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,760
And so the thought that this entire time

1440
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,800
I've done that exact same thing to someone else

1441
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,400
and pushed that off on someone else

1442
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,120
fucks with me and I'm fucking sorry.

1443
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,040
Vanessa actually managed, for one fleeting moment,

1444
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,160
to make a connection between her own past hurt and trauma

1445
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,520
and the pain she'd inflicted on another person,

1446
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,000
which is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event

1447
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,920
on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths

1448
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,960
who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child

1449
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,440
and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists

1450
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,040
who consume human misery like a glutton,

1451
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,000
gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet.

1452
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,400
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson

1453
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,080
that I should really try to stick to ideas,

1454
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,240
opinions, policy.

1455
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,480
However, this lesson would not last.

1456
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,680
Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content

1457
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,680
well past the point it had become passé,

1458
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,560
making a video with Big Red in the thumbnail

1459
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,800
as recently as 2019.

1460
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,280
I admit, I thought she was fading into irrelevance,

1461
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,480
but once again, I underestimated Vanessa.

1462
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,180
In July 2019, her channel rocketed

1463
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,320
to a new level of success when she released a video

1464
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,200
titled Exposing Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

1465
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,120
In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman,

1466
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,920
or rather, she believes, a man posing as a trans woman

1467
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,120
called Jessica Yaniv.

1468
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,440
Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?

1469
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,200
Well, as far as I can tell,

1470
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,880
everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true.

1471
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,500
Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal

1472
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,480
to close down several beauty salons

1473
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,880
that had refused to wax her hairy balls

1474
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,600
after she approached them about it

1475
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,320
in an awkward and creepy way.

1476
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,920
She has a long history of sending

1477
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,960
extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls.

1478
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,760
And she attempted to host a topless pool party

1479
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,000
for unchaperoned children.

1480
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,640
Basically, Yaniv is someone who appropriates

1481
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,840
the language of transgender acceptance and equality

1482
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,120
to cloak predatory behavior toward minors.

1483
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,280
And my read on Yaniv, by the way,

1484
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,880
is not that she's a cunning manipulator,

1485
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,000
but that this is someone who is mentally

1486
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,080
not playing with a full deck.

1487
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,320
After the success of her initial video,

1488
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,960
Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv

1489
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,960
rebranding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen,

1490
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,960
exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them.

1491
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,120
And at first, I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa.

1492
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,960
At least now she's finally picking on someone

1493
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,040
who deserves it.

1494
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,280
But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have.

1495
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,540
One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story

1496
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,400
and the lack of attention given to it

1497
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,320
by other trans public figures

1498
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,640
as an indictment of trans activists,

1499
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,800
who Vanessa thinks should spend more time

1500
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,680
sounding the alarm about

1501
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,880
TRANSGENDER PREDATORS.

1502
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,840
And I'm willing to admit,

1503
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,400
there's probably a valid point in there somewhere.

1504
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,620
Like, some trans people really are so paranoid

1505
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,920
about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts

1506
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,280
that they basically look the other way

1507
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,440
and refuse to acknowledge the small but real subset

1508
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,280
of trans people who are, in fact, dangerous perverts.

1509
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,800
But Blair, you talk about the Yaniv situation

1510
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,960
like it's urgent breaking news,

1511
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,640
like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name,

1512
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,840
but for the stubborn silence of trans activists.

1513
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,160
But why?

1514
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,320
Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv?

1515
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,740
There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults

1516
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,560
reported to American law enforcement every year.

1517
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,800
The literal president of America

1518
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,360
is a bit of a sexual predator himself.

1519
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,280
Why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep?

1520
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,400
I guess you could argue that since Yaniv

1521
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,560
is a trans-identified predator, a tip.

1522
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,040
We as real trans people have a responsibility

1523
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,440
to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her.

1524
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,660
Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that.

1525
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,240
And again, I think there's maybe some truth to that.

1526
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,920
Like, initially, the LGBT website Pink News

1527
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,360
straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination,

1528
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,080
which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics,

1529
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,520
but I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates

1530
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,960
about the transgender threat

1531
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,380
is really the best optics for us either.

1532
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,280
Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place?

1533
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,960
Is it simply because she cares deeply

1534
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,200
about the well-being of children

1535
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,920
and she thought making a video

1536
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,860
exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way to protect them?

1537
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,080
I mean, I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children,

1538
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,480
but it's still a YouTube video, and you have to ask,

1539
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,480
is the primary intention here really to stop a predator?

1540
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle?

1541
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,000
Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published,

1542
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,440
Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel

1543
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,440
titled Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

1544
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,680
This got two million views.

1545
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,520
Is this what you do

1546
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,680
with someone you've just accused of pedophilia?

1547
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,000
You host a live event debating the pedophile

1548
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,640
on your YouTube channel?

1549
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,120
What's to debate?

1550
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,120
I don't need to be scared in my own house

1551
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,400
that I'm gonna get fucking attacked

1552
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,160
and I'm gonna have to pay money,

1553
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,400
which is illegal in Canada, just saying, but.

1554
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,960
You think that was, like, cute?

1555
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,640
Was that a moment for you?

1556
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,800
Then, of course, you sell T-shirts

1557
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,720
featuring the meme that resulted

1558
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,520
from your YouTube pedophile debate.

1559
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,960
I mean, that makes sense.

1560
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,000
If you're gonna catch a predator,

1561
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,640
you gotta sell pedophile debate merch.

1562
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,360
And of course, you gotta follow

1563
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,360
the pedophile's makeup tutorial, you know, for the children.

1564
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,440
Now, I hate to be overly critical,

1565
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,040
but when I look at this,

1566
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,640
I don't see a high-minded activist

1567
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,120
working to protect children and trans people's image.

1568
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,240
I see a tabloid entertainer

1569
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,480
who's discovered a way to monetize milking lols

1570
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,880
from a mentally defective pervert.

1571
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,960
And I have to say, Blair, as a connoisseur of trash myself,

1572
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,240
I'm very entertained by all of this.

1573
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,280
Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial?

1574
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,040
That's genius.

1575
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,560
I wish I'd thought of that.

1576
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,240
But just be honest.

1577
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,920
This isn't activism.

1578
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,080
This isn't justice.

1579
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,880
It's a lolcow cult.

1580
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,520
It's like one of Mari's transsexuals took over the show,

1581
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,960
and I love that for her.

1582
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,920
I love that for her.

1583
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,240
But Blair, I can't help but notice

1584
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,620
you're still hitting all the same beats

1585
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,640
your videos have always hit.

1586
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,680
Attention, everyone.

1587
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,000
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

1588
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,360
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

1589
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,960
It's very important that we all gather around

1590
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
to condemn this bad transgender

1591
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,920
who is not a real transgender.

1592
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,560
And Blair, I'll give you this.

1593
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,920
You are getting better at choosing your targets.

1594
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,760
The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture

1595
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,160
and Jessica Yeniv is good casting for the part.

1596
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,040
She's a transphobe's boogeyman come to life,

1597
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,600
and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her.

1598
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,640
But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously

1599
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,260
as anything more than a smarter version

1600
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,800
of the same in-group cringe humilitainment

1601
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,480
you've always made.

1602
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,920
And by the way, you may wanna check in

1603
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,480
on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.

1604
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,680
Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber

1605
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,840
who produces a series called Trans Stupid.

1606
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,320
Hi, everyone, and welcome to another edition

1607
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,440
of Trans Stupid, the show where I take a look

1608
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,480
at the wonderful world of LGBTQIA++ news

1609
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,960
because stupidity is intersectional.

1610
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,880
Transgender?

1611
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,740
More like trans-retarded.

1612
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,180
More like trans-gay.

1613
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,800
Trans-gay, I love that.

1614
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,300
I'm literally, I just realized I'm literally trans-gay.

1615
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,540
Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses

1616
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,940
of trans ideology and activism,

1617
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,100
which in theory I do think is a perspective

1618
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,100
worth including in the conversation.

1619
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,500
But in practice, well, let's just say,

1620
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,140
Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary

1621
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,260
about why Chris Chan is not a real transgender.

1622
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,460
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

1623
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,980
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

1624
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,300
I'm getting pretty tired of this.

1625
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,100
And here's her transition advice

1626
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,540
to trans women just beginning their journey.

1627
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,980
You probably have this image in your head

1628
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:45,100
that you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman.

1629
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,460
Like, effectively, you're going to be this seal.

1630
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,620
Like, look at this seal.

1631
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,740
Isn't this seal adorable?

1632
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,500
Look, you're so cute.

1633
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,140
But the truth is, you're probably not looking

1634
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,940
like this seal right now, are you?

1635
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,180
You're probably more like this big bull seal

1636
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,620
barging your way into women's bathrooms saying,

1637
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,580
this is a woman's body.

1638
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:10,400
Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase.

1639
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,180
In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.

1640
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,180
Rose, no.

1641
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,820
Do not simp for Vanessa.

1642
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,260
It only encourages her.

1643
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:22,960
She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv,

1644
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,520
which seems like kind of a lot, Gorge.

1645
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,000
Would I be wrong to say I'm getting

1646
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,560
a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe?

1647
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,760
In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's

1648
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,880
numerous crimes and wrongdoings,

1649
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,760
but she also cannot resist making it very clear

1650
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,600
how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance.

1651
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,640
The irony being that this kind of tweet

1652
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,720
came from someone who you can smell

1653
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,800
just by looking at a picture of them.

1654
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,440
I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest

1655
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,000
at all in white knighting for Yaniv.

1656
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,680
I do not support her journey.

1657
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,340
As far as I'm concerned, she can eat shit,

1658
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,640
and maybe she does.

1659
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,000
I wouldn't be surprised.

1660
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,920
No, my point is that part of the catharsis

1661
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,240
that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive

1662
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,740
from making this kind of content

1663
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,280
comes from contrasting themselves

1664
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,480
as good, presentable, real trans people

1665
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,480
with the hideousness of the wretched fake trans dump truck.

1666
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,520
A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves.

1667
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,280
On one half, Vanessa.

1668
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,620
Looking fish, looking cunt.

1669
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,320
Always with her lip gloss in the live streams.

1670
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,760
And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast,

1671
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,680
the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig.

1672
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,180
And I'm allowed to say dump truck

1673
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,000
because before I transitioned,

1674
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,900
I was one of Vanessa's dump trucks.

1675
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,180
I was one of, hashtag, her dump trucks.

1676
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,880
Look, I happen to possess a little thing

1677
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,320
you probably haven't heard of it

1678
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,640
called inner beauty.

1679
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,620
That's right, sweetie, my pancreas, unclockable.

1680
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,480
♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ah ♪

1681
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,720
Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself

1682
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,480
with this cartoon, okay,

1683
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,960
straight up refers to Yaniv as the tubby trune

1684
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,280
and the titanic tranner of Canada.

1685
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,640
A particular titanic tranner of Canada.

1686
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,120
The titanic tranner of Canada.

1687
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,800
Tranner and trune being pejoratives for transgender

1688
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,080
that I associate with 4chan,

1689
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,300
where I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time.

1690
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,640
As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness,

1691
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,680
well, I'm guessing that must be another important part

1692
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,360
of stopping a predator, right?

1693
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,920
It seems almost taboo to condemn people

1694
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,440
for how rough they look

1695
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,280
when I think that that tough love in a way is needed

1696
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,480
because I look at what I looked like

1697
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,800
when I first transitioned

1698
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,240
and Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.

1699
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,840
Like, I looked bad.

1700
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,200
Like, I was overweight.

1701
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,320
I had a poor taste in clothes.

1702
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,640
Like, I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything.

1703
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,280
It was mostly t-shirts and jeans.

1704
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,320
You're probably more like this big bull scene

1705
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,920
barging your way into women's bathrooms

1706
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,720
saying, this is a woman's body.

1707
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,200
Now, you might never reach me.

1708
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,920
You'd see the face, in fact,

1709
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,240
very few of us turn out to look like black whites.

1710
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,320
And I want to make it very clear

1711
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,440
that when I'm talking about transition,

1712
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,200
I don't mean that you're-

1713
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,120
Rose, are you okay?

1714
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,760
No, you're not okay.

1715
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,160
None of us are okay.

1716
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,920
No trans woman remotely in the public eye

1717
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,720
is in any way okay.

1718
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,640
And look, I don't want to take the psychoanalysis too far

1719
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,120
because I don't know from watching YouTube videos

1720
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,760
what's going on in someone's head,

1721
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,480
but I can try to make intelligent inferences.

1722
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,320
And I think it's pretty revealing

1723
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,160
that this is how Rose introduces the topic

1724
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,520
of Jessica Yaniv.

1725
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,200
I think, well, one of the biggest characters

1726
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,720
in the whole fucking world at the moment,

1727
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,040
which is Jessica Yaniv.

1728
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,440
Rose, Gorge,

1729
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,960
Jessica Yaniv is not one of

1730
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,040
the biggest characters in the whole world at any moment.

1731
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,520
This is not a world historical figure.

1732
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,840
At the end of the day,

1733
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,680
this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend

1734
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,760
off the streets of Vancouver, BC.

1735
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,960
The only reason anyone has heard of her at all

1736
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,760
is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch a predator

1737
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,360
and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.

1738
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,640
She is not one of the most important characters

1739
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,480
in the world,

1740
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,720
but it sounds like what she is, Rose,

1741
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,920
is one of the most important characters in your brain.

1742
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,560
This is distorted thinking.

1743
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,320
It's like A-Log comparing Chris-Chan to Hitler.

1744
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,720
You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession

1745
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,320
that you've lost perspective.

1746
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,000
And I'm sure you have what seemed to you

1747
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,880
like perfectly logical reasons

1748
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,040
why you're devoting so much attention to this.

1749
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,520
And I know videos about Yaniv get a lot of views,

1750
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,120
so I'm sure that's a factor too.

1751
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,240
But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession

1752
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,120
when I see one.

1753
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,400
And I know that being a visible trans woman on the internet

1754
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,000
is more difficult than most people can imagine.

1755
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,640
And I know that pretty much every trans person

1756
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,760
is bullied or shamed or humiliated

1757
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,360
at some point in our lives.

1758
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,680
And I know how good it can feel

1759
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,600
to take all the horrible things transphobes and bullies

1760
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,640
and TERFs have said about us

1761
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,640
and repeat them verbatim about some big, fat, fake,

1762
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,440
dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist.

1763
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,320
Oh, it feels good to be the TERF for once.

1764
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,760
It feels good to be the judge rather than the judged.

1765
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,000
Because when you point the finger at someone else,

1766
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,280
you're also pointing away from yourself.

1767
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,280
And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles,

1768
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,640
queer people are often treated

1769
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,240
like suspected sex criminals by default.

1770
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,940
So there's safety in being the one who spearheads

1771
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,440
the think-of-the-children type moral crusade.

1772
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,560
And when you expose a trans predator,

1773
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,240
you get that feeling of safety plus the relief

1774
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,040
of having someone in particular to blame

1775
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,440
for the shame and stigma we all feel.

1776
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,760
Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us,

1777
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,160
but that's just not true.

1778
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,000
It's a simple answer to a complicated problem.

1779
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,640
It's scapegoating.

1780
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,760
When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube,

1781
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,600
I see a community trying to cope with stigma

1782
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,280
and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief.

1783
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,080
It's basically a blood sacrifice.

1784
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,520
It's not rational.

1785
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,000
It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction.

1786
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,960
It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame.

1787
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,480
And Yaniv is simply the latest and most deserving

1788
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,680
in a long line of bad transgenders

1789
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,920
who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name

1790
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,520
and are the reason people hate us

1791
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,760
and must be condemned and destroyed.

1792
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,840
But when Yaniv is finally gone,

1793
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,440
when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is,

1794
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,600
you're just gonna find a new scapegoat to take her place.

1795
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,800
And the shame cycle continues.

1796
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,360
The humiliation and bullying we've experienced

1797
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,040
is internalized as shame.

1798
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,240
When we project that shame onto scapegoats

1799
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,800
and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt,

1800
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,440
and we voice that contempt by shaming other people,

1801
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,280
which starts a new cycle.

1802
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,440
So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags,

1803
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,360
new shame dumps, new lolcows,

1804
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,040
and you can end up like one of the people

1805
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,000
who's been archiving Chris Chan for 13 years,

1806
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,160
but that will never really heal us.

1807
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,920
God, how do I get out of this video?

1808
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,400
Ugh, I'm trying to have a serious conversation

1809
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,360
dressed as some sort of catgirl degenerate.

1810
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,320
Cringe.

1811
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,160
Shame.

1812
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,540
I'm ashamed.

1813
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,380
Don't look at me.

1814
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,040
You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers.

1815
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,840
Thank you, yes, I suppose it is groundbreaking.

1816
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,480
All right, children, let's review our notes on cringe.

1817
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,560
The word cringe really describes two different emotions,

1818
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,680
either embarrassment or contempt.

1819
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,040
You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else.

1820
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,720
When you're embarrassed for someone else,

1821
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,600
we call that vicarious embarrassment.

1822
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,440
And that can mean cringing with someone

1823
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,720
who is embarrassed themselves,

1824
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,680
which I've argued is excluded

1825
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,760
in the internet usage of the word cringe.

1826
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,920
Or it can mean embarrassment for someone

1827
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,920
who isn't embarrassed themselves,

1828
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,440
in which case we say we're cringing at them.

1829
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,240
Now if someone who's part of your in-group

1830
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,680
is embarrassing themselves,

1831
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,180
and by proxy, embarrassing the in-group that includes you,

1832
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,080
you feel in-group cringe,

1833
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,880
which can involve both vicarious embarrassment

1834
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,920
and a kind of self-cringe.

1835
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,200
And on the contempt side,

1836
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,240
contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you,

1837
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,480
particularly if they're traits

1838
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,480
you have contempt for in yourself,

1839
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,800
can develop into morbid cringe,

1840
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,960
which is that obsession with a lolcow,

1841
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,560
that addiction to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror

1842
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,840
in which you see reflected

1843
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,080
everything you hate about yourself or about your in-group.

1844
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,080
Now I wanna end this video by reflecting

1845
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,440
on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful.

1846
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,960
And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good.

1847
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,360
Embarrassment serves a social purpose.

1848
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,880
It helps us interact smoothly with each other

1849
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,780
by telling us what not to do.

1850
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,300
And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories

1851
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,360
can be cathartic.

1852
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,600
It can make you feel closer to other people,

1853
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,480
more alike, less alone.

1854
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,840
I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe

1855
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,840
is very healthy.

1856
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,560
It shows you're self-aware,

1857
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,220
and you care at least a little bit what other people think.

1858
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:22,760
You know, I've met people who never cringe at themselves,

1859
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,000
and let's just say they're not my kind of people.

1860
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,120
They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves,

1861
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,560
regardless of how they're actually coming across.

1862
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,240
But I think partly out of fear

1863
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,340
of ending up like one of those people,

1864
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,400
I've overcompensated, and I cringe too much,

1865
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,680
both at myself and at other people.

1866
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,160
It's a habit that's kind of making me hate myself,

1867
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,460
and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others.

1868
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,060
And when I take a look around the internet,

1869
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,000
like I've done in this video,

1870
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,400
I find that I'm not alone in this situation,

1871
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,720
and it's not cute.

1872
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,880
So how do we cringe less?

1873
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,240
Well, the cliche solution is self-love,

1874
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,560
which our culture places a lot of value on.

1875
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,560
Self-love and self-esteem.

1876
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,800
You know, I don't care what haters and losers say.

1877
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,200
I'm a bad bitch.

1878
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,840
I look like a supermodel.

1879
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,440
I'm a genius.

1880
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,040
We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way,

1881
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,540
but it doesn't work, because it's not realistic.

1882
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:20,440
You don't look like a supermodel, and you're not a genius.

1883
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,720
And when you realize that,

1884
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,640
you fall from one extreme to the other

1885
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,000
of what Chris Fleming calls

1886
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,160
the self-esteem tower of terror.

1887
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,560
You go from self-love to self-hate.

1888
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,760
But self-hate is also a distortion.

1889
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,680
Recently, I was listening

1890
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,760
to a David Foster Wallace interview.

1891
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,280
Yeah, I know, cringe.

1892
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,840
And he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked.

1893
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,760
There's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.

1894
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,280
How dare you notice that?

1895
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,560
I'm in this photo, and I don't like it.

1896
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,880
But it's true.

1897
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,000
Time spent cringing at yourself

1898
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,040
is still time spent obsessing over yourself.

1899
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,800
And it's hard not to, because humans are animals,

1900
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,040
so our perspective is egocentric by nature.

1901
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,280
But we can still learn to appreciate

1902
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,320
that the world is bigger than us.

1903
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,480
I mean, I've heard rumors.

1904
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,920
In that book we started with, Cringeworthy,

1905
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,400
Melissa Dahl advocates not self-love or self-hate,

1906
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,320
but what she calls self-indifference.

1907
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,160
She says,

1908
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,920
Self-indifference is the relief of realizing

1909
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,480
that you are simply not that big a deal.

1910
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,920
So yeah, I was pretty cringey in the past,

1911
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,520
and I'm still pretty cringey now.

1912
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,960
But you know what?

1913
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,360
Everyone else is pretty cringey too.

1914
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,840
And the world's probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway,

1915
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,560
so I don't know if I would call this good news,

1916
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,020
but if it's any consolation,

1917
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,080
nothing matters.

1918
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,000
Nothing matters.

1919
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,800
Nothing matters.

1920
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,480
Nothing matters.

1921
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,240
Nothing matters.

1922
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,120
Nothing matters.

1923
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,080
Nothing matters.

1924
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,400
Nothing matters.

1925
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,000
Nothing matters.

1926
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,840
Nothing matters.

1927
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,720
Nothing matters.

1928
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,720
Nothing matters.
