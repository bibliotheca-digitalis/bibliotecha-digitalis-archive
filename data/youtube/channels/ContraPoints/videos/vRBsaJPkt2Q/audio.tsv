0	4760	Hello again, the gays.
4760	6880	Welcome to my garden party fantasy.
6880	8560	Straight people, you're of course welcome
8560	12440	to tag along too, provided you're emotionally damaged.
12440	14440	Hi, hey, how are you?
14440	16560	Cringe, let's talk about it.
16560	19520	The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately.
19520	21840	It just pops into my head all the time.
21840	25020	Like, when I randomly remember that month back in 2013
25020	27160	when all of my Facebook posts were just lyrics
27160	30320	to Ke$ha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter.
30320	31160	Why?
31160	32880	What audience was that for?
32880	35760	Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?
35760	37840	Cringe, mega cringe.
37840	40040	I think I say this word like 50 times a day.
40040	41620	Cringe, cringe, cringe.
41620	42760	And I'm not the only one.
42760	44480	Google Trends shows that in the US,
44480	45920	search interest in the word cringe
45920	48200	has dramatically increased over the last decade,
48200	51160	peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since.
51160	52760	And if you look at worldwide trends,
52760	55440	search interest in cringe is at an all-time high
55440	57120	the month I'm making this video.
57880	59000	So what is cringe?
59000	61480	Well, let's start with some examples.
61480	63760	There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled,
63760	66000	What Things Really Make You Cringe?
66000	68160	And here's some of the most upvoted responses.
68160	69920	The time I was talking too loud at a wedding
69920	71280	when I wasn't supposed to,
71280	72800	and everyone at the wedding turned around
72800	74720	to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.
74720	76240	Recordings of my own voice.
76240	77840	When I remember that I did the,
77840	81120	I do have a boyfriend, he just goes to another school thing.
81120	83980	Early teen me, so many cringe stuff I did.
83980	86440	I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.
86440	88000	This happened about two years ago.
88000	89800	I ordered some pizza hot online,
89800	91040	and when it was delivered,
91040	92840	the lady handed me the pizza boxes.
92840	95920	I said, thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.
95920	98320	I said, oh, and then she hands me the receipt
98320	99440	to sign and leave a tip,
99440	102060	and I spend 30 seconds trying to get the pen to work.
102060	105240	She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.
105240	108140	I said, oh, and then she reaches to get the receipt
108140	109720	and tells me the pizza smells good.
109720	111280	Then I said, you too,
111280	113040	and then I closed the door and killed myself.
113040	115120	All of these responses illustrate exactly
115120	117120	what writer Melissa Dahl says in her book,
117120	119400	Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.
119400	122260	According to Dahl, the moments that make us cringe
122260	124520	are when we're yanked out of our own perspective
124520	126180	and we can suddenly see ourselves
126180	128080	from somebody else's point of view.
128080	130440	She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter,
130440	133700	who in the 60s did a study of the Biame tribe in New Guinea,
133700	135400	where he showed them mirror, video,
135400	137960	and photographic images of themselves for the first time
137960	139440	and described the results.
139440	140680	They were paralyzed.
140680	142520	After their first startled response,
142520	144480	covering their mouths and ducking their heads,
144480	147160	they stood transfixed, staring at their images,
147160	149840	only their stomach muscles, betraying great tension.
149840	152080	So basically, they cringed at themselves.
152080	154720	Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.
154720	156360	Like, pretty much everyone seems to hate
156360	158400	the sound of their voice when they hear a recording
158400	159280	for the first time.
159280	160640	I guess because it sounds different
160640	162600	from the way you hear it resonating in your head.
162600	164700	So when you hear the recording, you realize,
164700	167680	oh God, that's how other people hear me all the time.
167680	169760	And you're suddenly aware of this clash
169760	171840	between the way you appear to yourself
171840	173480	and the way you appear to other people.
173480	175920	That's when you cringe, the feeling Dahl describes
175920	178580	as the intense visceral reaction produced
178580	180960	by an awkward moment, an unpleasant kind
180960	183760	of self-recognition, where you suddenly see yourself
183760	185360	through someone else's eyes.
185360	187640	It's a forced moment of self-awareness,
187640	189360	and it usually makes you cognizant
189360	191920	of the disappointing fact that you aren't measuring up
191920	193600	to your own self-concept.
193600	195320	When you're talking too loud at a wedding
195320	196840	and suddenly everyone turns around
196840	198800	to see what asshole wouldn't shut up,
198800	200960	you suddenly realize how you look to them,
200960	203240	because we've all at some point turned around
204000	205040	to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.
205040	208360	But this time, you're the asshole, cringe.
208360	211560	Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm
211560	212840	that makes us cringe.
212840	215580	There's no law of state or even of etiquette
215580	217880	that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed
217880	218920	to speak at a wedding.
218920	221720	It's something you have to intuit based on context.
221720	223360	How loud are other people speaking?
223360	224920	Is the ceremony about to begin
224920	227000	and we're all supposed to be quiet now?
227000	229340	According to YouTuber Vsauce, Michael here,
229340	230960	the function of awkwardness is that
230960	233640	it sands social dynamics by smoothing out
233640	236560	what even etiquette doesn't rule on.
236560	238800	Cringe is the electric shock,
238800	241920	the emotional punishment for being awkward.
241920	244920	It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior
244920	246780	by wounding the ego.
246780	248440	And memories of your cringy moments
248440	251240	are often just as painful as the moments themselves.
251240	253360	10 years later, you'll be trying to fall asleep
253360	254860	and for no reason at all,
254860	256800	your brain will decide to remind you
256800	259080	of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding
259080	261040	and of the stupid thing you were saying
261040	263200	when everyone turned around to stare at you
263200	264680	and you'll cringe all over again.
264680	267520	That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful
267520	269280	because you look back and you realize,
269280	274280	damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years.
274520	276600	Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone
276600	280000	who remembers me before, I don't know, November?
280000	282100	Now all the examples we've considered so far
282100	283560	involve self-cringe,
283560	286360	but usually when we talk about cringe on the internet,
286360	288720	we're talking about cringing at other people.
288720	291040	Popular subreddits like r slash cringe,
291040	294120	cringepix, and cringetopia host videos and images
294120	296200	of people behaving in cringey ways.
296200	297800	For instance, a maternity photo
297800	299240	that looks like a hostage crisis,
299240	301560	grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry,
301560	303600	and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate
303600	306040	during his first encounter with black people.
306040	307120	Who let the dogs out?
307120	307960	Who, who?
308840	312600	Ugh, watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire.
312600	314600	It makes me want to crawl out of my body
314600	316920	and escape into another dimension.
316960	319960	I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others.
319960	322080	For me, it's uncomfortable to the point
322080	324720	where I will reflexively pause a video like that
324720	326160	because I just can't stand it.
326160	328560	In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos,
328560	330960	which, sweaty, if you put that shit on,
330960	332200	I will leave the room.
332200	335040	So why is it that cringing at other people hurts
335040	337280	in the same way as cringing at yourself?
337280	339720	Well, one theory is that cringing at other people
339720	342240	is simply vicarious embarrassment,
342240	343840	or secondhand embarrassment.
343840	345760	Basically, it's a form of empathy.
345760	347000	When you cringe at someone,
347000	349780	you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,
349780	352420	just as if if you watch someone fall down the stairs,
352420	355120	you might wince empathetically with their pain.
355120	355960	But there's a problem
355960	358360	with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,
358360	359840	or at least a complication,
359840	362240	which is that in the purest examples of cringe,
362240	366120	the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed.
366120	368320	In fact, often they're super confident,
368320	370520	and it's actually their lack of self-awareness
370520	373600	about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.
373600	374600	Like when a woman posts
374600	377280	a ridiculously over-facetuned picture of herself
377280	379780	as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,
379780	382500	or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy
382500	385360	when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.
385360	387040	So in the internet sense of the word,
387040	390040	cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.
390040	392840	Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,
392840	394900	and I do feel embarrassed for her,
394900	398320	but she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed.
398320	399480	You guys are just standing up
399480	400880	because you feel bad that I fell,
400880	402920	and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.
402960	405040	Nothing about this is cringe.
405040	407160	Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.
407160	409800	Maybe she looks back on it, and it's still embarrassing,
409800	412080	but I don't cringe at her.
412080	414960	Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone
414960	416460	and cringing with them.
416460	419520	When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her
419520	422140	in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.
422140	424560	My feelings mirror what she's feeling.
424560	426840	But when I'm cringing at someone,
426840	428400	I'm feeling something very different
428400	429360	to what they're feeling.
429360	432120	I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here
432120	436040	because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.
436040	438920	Another example is bad American Idol auditions,
438920	441160	which are quintessential cringe content.
441160	443400	People try out for American Idol
443400	445680	because they think they're good enough singers
445680	447680	to compete in a national competition,
447680	450280	so they're effectively revealing their own delusions
450280	452440	when they show up and sing like this.
452440	457440	♪ Is this the real life or is this just fantasy ♪
458920	461680	It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.
461680	463560	Most of us are bad singers, right?
463560	465720	When people sing Happy Birthday at a party,
465720	467600	usually they're singing in three different keys
467600	468960	at no particular tempo.
468960	470720	But that's not cringe because the point
470720	473520	of singing Happy Birthday is not to sound amazing.
473520	475680	Bad American Idol auditions are cringe
475680	478840	because of the contestants' misplaced confidence.
478840	481720	Who are you as good as, in your opinion?
481720	483600	The lead singer from Queen.
483600	487360	It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury
487360	490040	when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog.
490040	492620	♪ Frozen, see ♪
494080	495400	I admit that watching Red,
495400	497960	I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him.
497960	500120	I laugh at his ludicrous performance,
500120	501480	just like the judges do.
501480	503480	And because he's so cocky,
503480	506680	and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,
506680	509340	there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys
509340	510220	his failure.
510220	512040	There's almost a sense of karma,
512040	514240	a sense that because of his tragic hubris,
514240	517840	he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.
517840	519640	And my sense that he deserves it
519640	522160	suppresses my compassionate response,
522160	525080	and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have
525080	527860	about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.
527860	530520	Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant,
530520	532440	Misha, who's there with her mom,
532440	534960	and they both seem like such sweethearts.
534960	537960	I do believe in her talent, very much.
537960	540640	And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,
540640	542480	but I'm rooting for her,
542480	544800	and when she embarrasses herself,
544800	548880	I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe.
548880	553680	♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me ♪
553680	554520	Yikes.
554520	557040	My differing reactions to Red and Misha
557040	559280	track a distinction that Doll makes
559280	562800	between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.
562800	566360	Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification
566360	568120	with the person you're cringing at.
568120	570040	Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves
570040	571560	in the cringeworthy moment,
571560	574420	you still feel the embarrassment they would feel,
575060	576140	or perhaps ought to feel,
576140	579420	if they were aware of how other people were perceiving them.
579420	581580	Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,
581580	583860	involves an emotional distancing
583860	585500	from the person you're cringing at.
585500	587300	Just like with compassionate cringe,
587300	590380	you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,
590380	593260	but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,
593260	596420	you feel annoyance and disgust at them,
596420	598380	and maybe even a little schadenfreude.
598380	600420	So these are actually two very different
600420	604420	emotional responses, vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.
604420	606260	We call both feelings cringe,
606260	608220	not because they're similar feelings,
608220	609820	but because they're responses
609820	611780	to the same type of situation,
611780	614380	people lacking self-awareness embarrassing themselves
614380	615580	without realizing it.
615580	619020	Now embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,
619020	621020	like pretty unpleasant feelings.
621020	623460	So why are we so fascinated by content
623460	625020	that makes us feel this way?
625020	626540	Why do these cringe subreddits
626540	628460	have more than a million members?
628460	631340	Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos
631340	633180	so popular on YouTube?
633180	636420	Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?
636420	637900	Well, I think the answer to that question
637900	639620	depends on whether we're cringing
639620	641900	compassionately or contemptuously.
641900	643540	When I read that Ask Reddit thread
643540	645660	where all the people share their cringe stories,
645660	647300	I cringe compassionately.
647300	650460	That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.
650460	653580	And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity
653580	655180	and camaraderie with them.
655180	656980	I recognize myself in them,
656980	659500	and I'm reassured to hear that other people
659500	662140	are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.
662140	664540	I'm not the only one who cringes at my past
664540	666060	or at videos of myself.
666060	667740	I'm not the only one who sometimes says,
667740	670580	you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.
670580	672900	When we collectively laugh at these situations,
672900	675580	we're bonding over our shared human frailty.
675580	678660	We're recognizing that we all say the wrong thing sometimes,
678660	681660	that we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion
681660	683460	only to later educate ourselves
683460	686700	and realize how ignorant and wrong we were,
686700	688340	that we've all tried to present ourselves
688340	693060	as cool and likable, as beautiful and talented and badass,
693060	694460	only to totally miss the mark
694460	696260	and completely embarrass ourselves.
696260	699860	And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity,
699860	703740	our ridiculous pretenses, it makes us feel less alone.
703740	704780	Now this is all, of course,
704780	707260	assuming that we're cringing compassionately.
707260	711660	But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet
711660	713580	does not encourage compassion.
713580	715580	And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact
715580	719300	because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.
719300	721220	This is the 21st century, right?
721220	724820	Pillories and freak shows and public floggings,
724820	728060	these are barbaric practices from the dark ages, right?
728060	730180	Surely no one on the internet would ever
730180	734180	entertain themselves by humiliating people, right?
734180	738620	We've got maniacs!
738620	740060	We've got wackadoos!
740060	742980	We've got schizos, fatties, and spergs!
742980	746380	Come see sexual deviants on display!
746380	749420	That's right, folks, we've got cackling perverts
749420	750740	of every denomination.
750740	752500	Come see the panty sniffer!
752500	755780	He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings!
755780	757420	Come see the skeleton girl!
757420	759380	She hasn't had a bite in 30 days!
759380	763580	That's right, we've got real, live lesbians!
763580	765580	And I'll be your master of ceremonies.
765580	769340	Half man, half woman, all freak.
770340	774020	Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.
774020	776060	Welcome to the dark side of cringe.
776060	779420	Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture,
779420	782380	and by that I mean there's whole channels making content
782380	784780	that centers the experience of cringing.
784780	788100	And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content,
788100	792060	including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.
792060	795020	I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,
795020	798180	which was the heyday of the Feminist Cringe Compilation,
798180	801580	or SJW Cringe Compilation, remember those?
801580	803860	This is ancient history by YouTube standards,
803860	807060	but in 2016, the word cringe was most associated
807060	809540	with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.
809540	812640	His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video,
812640	815220	which means he would play someone else's content,
815220	818900	then pause it to rant and voiceover about how cringe it is.
818900	820580	♪ No makeup with some sweatpants ♪
820580	823900	Oh my God, it's so fucking bad!
823900	825540	He looks like he's gender fluid,
825540	827380	he looks like a fucking lesbian!
827380	831340	This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,
831340	834060	and it was picked up by a rational herd
834060	836940	of skeptical beasts and free-thinking tuxedos.
836940	838340	What even is this thing?
838340	840540	It must be one of the 76 genders.
840540	843500	I didn't realize retarded was a gender.
843500	846340	Sorry my dudes, you are on the cringe side of history.
846340	850180	Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.
850180	852240	The logical antelope isn't inviting you
852240	854540	to foster a shared sense of humanity
854540	856140	by recognizing your own weakness
856140	858300	and the embarrassment of screeching feminists.
858300	861220	No, this is an invitation to contempt.
861220	862660	Here's a YouTube video titled
862660	865100	Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.
865100	867180	You'd expect from the title that it would be a video
867180	870640	of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways,
870640	871700	but it isn't.
871700	873260	It's literally just a compilation
873260	874980	of fat people doing things.
874980	877220	This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.
877220	878820	Is this cringe?
878820	880460	What is cringe about it?
880460	882000	Earlier we defined cringe
882000	884740	as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt
884740	886180	for someone who lacks awareness
886180	887740	about the way others are perceiving them.
887740	889980	But in this video of a swimming fat woman,
889980	891180	there's no context,
891180	893780	so we don't know anything about her mental state.
893780	895180	And we certainly don't know
895180	897900	whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.
897900	899260	If there is an interview where she talks
899260	900740	about how she looks like a supermodel
900740	902700	or if she tried to Photoshop herself
902700	904260	to look like a size four,
904260	906040	okay, maybe that would be cringe.
906040	908380	But that's not what's going on in this clip.
908380	911460	She's just existing in water.
911460	914540	What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?
915340	917020	Presumably something along the lines of,
917020	919900	ew, fat people, gross.
919900	922020	It's literally just disgust, right?
922020	924700	Disgust and contempt for a type of person,
924700	925860	a type of body.
925860	927460	Here's another cringe compilation.
927460	930500	This one titled gender-fluid non-binary cringe.
930500	932180	And we're watching a young teenager
932180	934020	discuss their plans to start vlogging
934020	936140	about their gender-fluid identity.
936140	938060	Honestly, it's kind of terrifying
938060	943060	because gender-fluid people just aren't accepted.
943660	945380	Yeah, apparently not.
945380	947780	And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this
947780	949460	in a cringe compilation,
949460	951540	it seems that the person in this video
951540	954020	was dead on about how people would perceive them.
954020	955940	But despite that self-awareness,
955940	957780	we're being invited to cringe
957780	961020	because I guess being gender-fluid,
961020	964780	like being fat, is cringe in and of itself.
964780	968180	Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.
968180	970960	This is not real cringe, I wanna say.
970960	972920	Cringe has to involve a clash
972920	975640	between self-perception and perception by others.
975640	979140	But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt
979140	981720	is so widespread that there's really no point
981720	982960	in objecting to it.
982960	985500	If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia,
985500	987480	one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,
987480	990640	you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow,
990640	994760	a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper.
994760	996680	These are subcultures associated
996680	998880	with nerdy social outcasts.
998880	1002400	They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online.
1002400	1005380	I'd like to share with you a list that I put together
1005380	1008200	of groups that are often considered to be cringe.
1008200	1012040	Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels,
1012040	1015840	neckbeards, fedora tippers, gamers, TikTok teens,
1015840	1018400	not-like-other-girls girls, fanfic writers,
1018400	1021720	beat poets, SGWs, feminists, magas,
1021720	1023680	trans people, non-binary people,
1023680	1026760	transtrenders, queer AFAB ukulele players,
1026760	1028620	autistic people, fat people,
1028620	1031120	the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled.
1031120	1032840	Now I'm searching for some thread
1032840	1034640	that all these groups have in common,
1034640	1036880	and a handful of themes do jump out.
1036880	1040340	Deviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.
1040340	1044080	A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.
1044080	1047200	The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.
1047200	1050000	Obsessive interest in unconventional hobbies.
1050000	1051440	Low social status.
1051440	1052700	It's pretty easy to wind up
1052700	1054560	in the cringe category these days.
1054560	1056620	If you add up all the groups on this list,
1057480	1059340	I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.
1059340	1061140	It includes me three or four times.
1061140	1063500	I'm of course a fedora tipping,
1063500	1065980	queer AFAB ukulele playing TikTok teen.
1065980	1068020	Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe
1068020	1072740	and try to be like compassionate or whatever?
1072740	1073700	Fuck no.
1073700	1076980	The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.
1076980	1080620	Oh no, this is social reject battle royale.
1080620	1082420	Clearly, contemptuous cringing
1082420	1084700	is rewarding to people in some way,
1084700	1088020	and I want to explore what the rewards might be.
1088020	1090020	Let's start by looking at the role of cringe
1090020	1091460	in internet politics,
1091460	1094860	where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.
1094860	1098220	At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,
1098220	1102060	you couldn't escape clips of this woman known as Big Red,
1102060	1104980	a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event
1104980	1107020	and read off a list of feminist theses
1107020	1108580	while swearing profusely.
1108580	1112140	It's part of patriarchy, part of patriarchy.
1112140	1114460	I don't know if you're noticing a theme, patriarchy.
1115220	1116260	I'm reading, fuck face.
1116260	1119660	Mr. Entitled, Mr. Ego, patriarchy, fuck face.
1119660	1122140	She's one of these people who generates memeable phrases
1122140	1123340	at an amazing rate.
1123340	1125200	I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,
1125200	1128100	but I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia.
1128100	1130980	Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,
1130980	1132820	reaction videos, remixes,
1132820	1135260	and even anti-feminist video essays.
1135260	1138540	Often Big Red was framed as like the feminist,
1138540	1140460	the mascot of feminism,
1140460	1143620	a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists,
1143620	1144860	which is highly dishonest
1144860	1147420	considering she's not even a high-profile activist
1147420	1148260	or thinker.
1148260	1149820	She was literally some random woman
1149820	1151140	on the streets of Toronto.
1151140	1153500	But because of this amusing 12-minute video,
1153500	1156060	it was insisted upon that we all take a stand
1156060	1158860	on this random woman who, we were told,
1158860	1161940	exemplified feminism in its purest form.
1161940	1164660	I call this strategy mascotization,
1164660	1167340	the construction of a straw man nemesis.
1167340	1170100	What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person
1170100	1172340	and you appoint them the mascot
1172340	1174180	of an opposing political team.
1174180	1176260	It's very simple, but very effective.
1176260	1178780	And it's best paired with memification.
1178780	1181540	That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,
1181540	1183620	you freeze it, and you declare
1183620	1186100	that that moment fully represents a person.
1186100	1188180	Then, through mascotization,
1188180	1190500	you declare that this memified person
1190500	1192820	represents an entire group or movement.
1192820	1196300	Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester,
1196300	1198140	You're fucking a white male!
1198140	1200140	Memified as AIDS Skrillex,
1200140	1201460	and this protester,
1201460	1203660	Can't you hate me? I'm a killer!
1203660	1205620	Can't you hate me? I'm a killer!
1205620	1207940	who was memified as Drigglypuff.
1207940	1210260	The two of them symbolized the wretchedness
1210260	1212300	of beta new male cuckoldry
1212300	1216220	and the hysteria of social justice crybullies, respectively.
1216220	1219540	I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,
1219540	1220940	about whom hundreds of hours
1220940	1223460	of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.
1223460	1225900	Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,
1225900	1229740	as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb-tier casual,
1229740	1232260	throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.
1232260	1233100	But other times,
1233100	1235460	it was almost a super-villainous caricature,
1235460	1238900	this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype
1238900	1240980	threatening to confiscate your video games
1240980	1242860	and engulf you in her eunuch abyss.
1242860	1245620	Now, it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies
1245620	1248020	as super-villainous is effective,
1248020	1250560	though it comes at the risk of backfiring
1250560	1253660	by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,
1253660	1255400	a little too badass.
1255400	1257700	But the subtler strategy of symbolizing
1257700	1260220	your political enemies not with an evil,
1260220	1262460	but with a cringe-worthy mascot,
1262460	1264900	works because it connects with a wide audience
1264900	1266980	in an intense, emotional way.
1266980	1269260	Most people have a primal terror
1269260	1271660	of becoming the target of public ridicule.
1271660	1273940	And if someone has been made a laughingstock,
1273940	1275860	it's much safer to take the side
1275860	1277660	of the people doing the laughing
1277660	1280440	than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.
1280440	1283620	To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.
1283620	1287280	And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,
1287280	1290720	I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content
1290720	1293360	is that our brains want us to learn
1293360	1295680	how to avoid being laughed at.
1295680	1299240	When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,
1299240	1301440	laughing at someone and ridiculing them,
1301440	1305080	we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.
1305080	1308400	Don't act like that, or people will laugh at you.
1308400	1310040	This is a powerful tool for anyone
1310040	1312200	who wants to control human behavior.
1312200	1315120	It's why public humiliation has, in many societies,
1315120	1316860	been a punishment for criminals.
1317440	1319660	You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory,
1319660	1322500	at the whipping post, you see the mob jeering
1322500	1324340	and throwing rotten vegetables,
1324340	1326060	and it sends a powerful message.
1326060	1327840	Don't do whatever that guy did.
1327840	1330340	I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness
1330340	1333260	about the fact that the fear of public humiliation
1333260	1335720	rules us like it's the 17th century.
1335720	1338860	There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks,
1338860	1341220	but instead, there's teenage YouTubers
1341220	1343060	making cringe reaction videos.
1343060	1344980	There's ex-boyfriends revenge-posting
1344980	1346300	their girlfriends' nudes.
1346700	1349180	There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming
1349180	1352100	just about anyone for alleged breaches of wokeness.
1352100	1354460	Public humiliation is a powerful force,
1354460	1358460	and it's usually, it's not a good force,
1358460	1360500	but there are some rare exceptions.
1360500	1363280	Back in the Gamergate era, Gamergate itself, of course,
1363280	1365300	being a study in public humiliation,
1365300	1367740	slut-shaming on a massive online scale,
1367740	1370260	YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated
1370260	1371780	by anti-feminism.
1371780	1374420	As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks,
1374420	1377420	and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers
1377420	1379640	who were constantly mobbed and harassed.
1379640	1382000	What I see as one of the turning points
1382000	1385420	in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days
1385420	1387980	to the left-tube world of today
1387980	1389980	was a handful of videos uploaded
1389980	1392540	by then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis,
1392540	1395140	in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual
1395140	1397100	called Davis Aurini.
1397100	1398260	Come on, Davis, we have to,
1398260	1399660	no, stop lecturing me about ethics,
1399660	1400500	we have to get out of here,
1400500	1403740	and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?
1403780	1404940	In his YouTube videos,
1404940	1407980	Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women
1407980	1409980	while posing in front of a toy skull
1409980	1413040	and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.
1415300	1418140	Men of the West, women in our culture
1418140	1421700	have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.
1421700	1424140	And so in discussing sluts versus whores,
1425340	1427580	I would start with the premise
1427580	1430340	that all women are whores.
1434660	1439660	Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views,
1440340	1442220	and a fairly positive response
1442220	1444700	even from a mostly male gamer audience,
1444700	1447540	who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.
1447540	1450340	Why did these videos work with this audience
1450340	1452060	where so many others didn't?
1452060	1453380	Well, I think it's because Harry
1453380	1455940	didn't moralistically call out Davis
1455940	1458900	for being problematic or misogynistic.
1458900	1462180	Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact
1462180	1465160	that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.
1465160	1466780	And Davis was a perfect target
1466780	1469620	because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.
1469620	1471620	He had no self-awareness about the fact
1471620	1474580	that pretty much everyone saw through his absurd posturing
1474580	1476700	as a badass tough guy by day,
1476700	1479060	profoundly dark philosopher by night.
1479060	1482420	We exist in a world with feminized legislation.
1482420	1485100	I've spoken to men and boys who've told me
1485100	1487060	that Harry's videos inspired
1487060	1489620	the beginning of a feminist awakening in them,
1489660	1492380	not just because they cringed at Davis Arrini,
1492380	1494740	but also because they recognized
1494740	1497340	a little bit of Davis in themselves,
1497340	1499200	and they cringed at that too.
1499200	1502500	Recognizing part of yourself in a cringe-worthy person
1502500	1505780	induces self-cringe, which can motivate you
1505780	1507980	to change your behavior, your beliefs,
1507980	1510240	or even your own self-concept.
1510240	1513220	And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance
1513220	1516140	of a recognizable stock character on the internet,
1516140	1518060	namely the fedora tipper,
1518060	1521220	basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader
1521220	1523060	for traditional masculinity,
1523060	1525220	but who's basically just a pasty nerd
1525220	1526420	who can't relate to women.
1526420	1528860	Davis was such an extreme version of this,
1528860	1531260	and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments
1531260	1533660	so frequently that I would classify him
1533660	1536860	as what the internet calls a lolcow.
1536860	1539100	Lolcow is old 4chan lingo.
1539100	1541540	It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric
1541540	1545020	or foolish behavior can be milked for lols.
1545020	1547300	Milking in this context can mean
1547300	1550500	simply watching a lolcow's behavior and laughing at them,
1550500	1552360	or it can mean making reaction videos
1552360	1553640	where you make fun of them,
1553640	1557300	or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them
1557300	1559940	to get a response that you find entertaining.
1559940	1562100	I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,
1562100	1564300	or my old videos about the Golden One,
1564300	1567820	as lolcow milking content with a political angle.
1567820	1570300	It was essentially an argument from ridicule,
1570300	1571940	an argument from cringe,
1571940	1573900	with the aim of convincing people,
1573900	1576660	don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs,
1576660	1579660	but also, and I'll just speak for myself here,
1579660	1583860	I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer,
1583860	1585620	and I wanted people to laugh.
1585620	1587420	There doesn't need to be a political agenda
1587420	1590960	behind milking lolcows, in fact, usually, there isn't.
1590960	1593780	The purest example of a lolcow I can think of
1593780	1596160	is actually someone from way before the internet,
1596160	1598340	namely Florence Foster Jenkins.
1598340	1602300	Jenkins, or Lady Florence, as she liked to be called,
1602340	1605220	was an American soprano who attracted a cult following
1605220	1608500	in New York City during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,
1608500	1610580	due to her being such a terrible singer
1610580	1614260	that people went to her concerts essentially for the lols.
1614260	1617340	She was described as the world's worst opera singer.
1617340	1619960	No one, before or since, has succeeded
1619960	1622420	in liberating themselves quite so completely
1622420	1624820	from the shackles of musical notation.
1624820	1627840	Behold this fucking camp queen.
1627840	1629520	Oh, we have no choice but to stan.
1629520	1632400	Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made.
1632400	1633800	Ah!
1633800	1635160	Ah!
1635160	1636000	Ah!
1637200	1638040	Ah!
1638040	1638860	Cringe.
1638860	1640840	She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,
1640840	1643240	the William Hung of her age.
1643240	1646040	Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence
1646040	1649640	until 1944, when she was 76 years old
1649640	1652200	and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert
1652200	1654500	to which newspaper critics showed up.
1654500	1656720	The next morning, the New York Sun reported,
1656760	1659040	much of her singing was hopelessly lacking
1659040	1662040	in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was
1662040	1663680	from its proper elevation,
1663680	1666400	the more the audience laughed and applauded.
1666400	1669760	And five days later, she had a heart attack and died.
1669760	1671920	I find something very touching about this story.
1671920	1673840	I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone
1673840	1675440	if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,
1675440	1679160	but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.
1679160	1681400	It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty
1681400	1684040	of Simon Cowell, at least he tries to stop these people
1684040	1685440	before things get out of hand.
1685440	1687480	I think it's normal to have mixed feelings
1687480	1688560	about a lolcow.
1688560	1692160	Like, yes, this is hilarious, but on the other hand,
1692160	1693880	doth not a lolcow bleed?
1693880	1695720	On some level, we know it's wrong
1695720	1698040	to entertain ourselves this way,
1698040	1699560	but on the other hand,
1699560	1702200	other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.
1702200	1704960	There's a good book about this called The Joy of Pain,
1704960	1707600	Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature
1707600	1708720	by Richard Smith.
1708720	1711040	Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take
1711040	1712480	in other people's misery,
1712480	1714800	and Smith argues that we experience it
1714800	1717560	because psychologically, we gain something
1717560	1718880	when other people lose.
1718880	1721400	We're constantly evaluating our own worth
1721400	1723720	by comparing ourselves to other people,
1723720	1726480	so we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,
1726480	1729040	a pleasant feeling of superiority,
1729040	1731760	from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,
1731760	1735160	especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.
1735160	1738880	Maybe I'm not perfect, but at least I'm not this lolcow.
1738880	1741600	And we also get a boost when people who are socially
1741600	1745800	above us, whom we envy, get brought down a peg.
1745800	1749880	James Charles' canceled party lolol.
1749880	1752920	I think Schadenfreude basically accounts
1752920	1755120	for just a huge percentage of the things
1755120	1757280	that happen on YouTube.com.
1757280	1761240	Smith uses the word humilitainment for this type of media,
1761240	1763520	like reality TV shows designed to produce
1763520	1765800	spectacular moments of embarrassment.
1765800	1769000	YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,
1769000	1771280	or some kind of carnival sideshow.
1772000	1773280	Take a look around you.
1773280	1775400	We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who,
1775400	1777000	at the time I'm making this video,
1777000	1778800	remains apparently in total denial
1778800	1781440	about her eating disorder and continues to make videos
1781440	1783880	modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.
1783880	1786600	We have Wings of Redemption, a bad-tempered gamer
1786600	1789080	who for a long time was essentially confined
1789080	1791320	by poverty, obesity, and depression
1791320	1793160	to streaming video games all day
1793160	1795800	to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him.
1795800	1799600	We have Onision, a habitual allege,
1799600	1801600	abuser of women and teenage girls,
1801600	1803960	who earlier this year essentially performed
1803960	1806240	his own mental breakdown on YouTube
1806240	1809080	after Patreon banned him for doxing an accuser.
1809080	1812400	I love kombucha!
1812400	1815040	Woo, woo, woo, woo!
1815040	1816620	Whose idea was it to give hundreds
1816620	1820040	of pathological narcissists access to video equipment?
1820040	1823160	What kind of sick social experiment are we living in?
1823160	1826040	And the viewers are no better than the performers.
1826040	1829520	Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick.
1830400	1831920	Oh, you people love nothing more
1831920	1834720	than to watch one of us poor, helpless egomaniacs
1834720	1837080	completely lose our minds live on camera.
1837080	1838680	Is this what you want, huh?
1838680	1843080	Is this what, you wanna total meltdown?
1843080	1845480	You know, as a creator, you have to be aware
1845480	1847800	that you're a circus performer,
1847800	1850940	and the crowd may in fact be more entertained
1850940	1853660	if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers.
1853660	1856760	Online media today is full of Lady Florences,
1856760	1859280	anti-celebrities with anti-fans.
1860040	1863420	To be clear, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong
1863420	1864920	with indulging now and then
1864920	1866720	in a little bit of light contempt.
1866720	1870240	Cringing at Davis or Rini or bad American Idol auditions
1870240	1873460	seems pretty harmless, but it can be taken too far,
1873460	1876760	and there's no better case study of taking it too far
1876760	1881520	than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler.
1881520	1882840	If you don't know what's coming,
1882840	1884320	you might wanna strap in, gorge,
1884320	1886880	because this is coconuts.
1886880	1888000	It's bananas.
1888000	1889600	It's a full fruit salad.
1889600	1891640	God, how do I even begin to explain this?
1892600	1895760	Well, Christine Weston Chandler,
1895760	1898840	more commonly known on the internet as Chris-Chan,
1898840	1903720	is the victim of what is quite possibly
1903720	1906440	the longest-running and most obsessive
1906440	1909000	internet trolling saga of all time.
1909000	1911880	She's the lolcow of lolcows.
1911880	1913880	Hello, everybody, this is Christine Chandler
1913880	1916020	coming to you live from home once again.
1916020	1918060	Chandler is an autistic trans woman,
1918060	1920540	and yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,
1920540	1922580	which I paused to explain
1922580	1924420	because I don't think I've ever seen anyone
1924420	1926660	actually take her transition seriously.
1926660	1928060	Most people seem to regard it
1928060	1930460	as simply another absurd symptom
1930460	1932300	of her hilarious mental condition.
1932300	1933660	In fact, a bunch of trans people
1933660	1935900	will probably get real salty with me
1935900	1938500	for making trans people look bad
1938500	1941020	by including Chris-Chan in our, oh,
1941020	1944500	our very prestigious and exclusive club.
1944500	1945340	Oh, please.
1945340	1948660	Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty.
1948660	1951740	This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.
1951740	1954100	God, how did trannies get so snobbish?
1954100	1957420	Look, is Chris-Chan really trans?
1957420	1960660	I don't know, and I don't care.
1960660	1963220	If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman,
1963220	1965260	I for one support her journey.
1965260	1966300	But it doesn't matter.
1966300	1969180	The relevant thing about Chris-Chan is not Chris-Chan.
1969180	1972340	It's the fact that for the last 13 years,
1972340	1974740	nearly every aspect of her life
1974740	1977380	has been obsessively archived online
1977380	1981540	by thousands of voyeurs known as Christorians.
1981540	1983980	Chancellor first acquired this anti-fandom
1983980	1987720	several internet centuries ago, back in 2007,
1987720	1991620	when 4chan took notice of her comic book series Sonichu,
1991620	1995340	a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu.
1995340	1997640	The comic is set in Quickville,
1997640	2000300	CWC being Chris-Chan's initials.
2000300	2002260	The protagonist is a self-insert
2003080	2005820	who references Chandler's real-life quote, love quest
2005820	2008340	to find a quote, boyfriend-free girl,
2008340	2012140	which apparently involved posting bizarre attraction signs
2012140	2013940	around her community college.
2013940	2016340	For this story to make sense, you have to keep in mind
2016340	2020580	that Chandler identified and presented as male until 2015.
2020580	2023260	So these trolls saw her as like,
2023260	2026860	the ultimate autistic incel man-child.
2026860	2028740	Just to give you a feel for this person,
2028740	2030740	here's Christine in 2018,
2030740	2033460	holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait,
2033460	2034980	note the Sonichu medallions.
2034980	2036720	Here's the bedroom she lived in,
2036720	2038580	and here she is in recent years,
2038580	2041720	giving us a full BronyCon eleganza.
2041720	2043180	Pegasister snapped.
2043180	2045820	Basically, she's the entire Cringetopia subreddit
2045820	2047660	condensed into a single person.
2047660	2050340	So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit,
2050340	2051820	because of course they did,
2051820	2053420	and they began tormenting her
2053420	2056060	by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,
2056060	2058780	posting candid photos of her, et cetera.
2058780	2060580	Chandler reacted to the trolls,
2061420	2062700	which of course encouraged them more,
2062700	2064980	and the harassment escalated and escalated.
2064980	2066100	They hacked her accounts,
2066100	2068420	or tricked her into giving out passwords,
2068420	2070460	they posted all her emails online,
2070460	2073060	they showed up in person and photographed her house,
2073060	2074220	they called her parents,
2074220	2078300	posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers,
2078300	2080420	in order to extract as much information
2080420	2081620	about her as possible.
2081620	2084280	And of course, they contacted Chandler herself,
2084280	2086380	which was very rewarding for trolls,
2086380	2088300	because she has no filter,
2088300	2090060	and was very naive and trusting.
2090060	2092020	So she was very willing to divulge,
2092020	2094300	or easily manipulated into divulging,
2094300	2096900	mortifying information about herself.
2096900	2100580	Sexual, psychological, scatological,
2100580	2103180	there's not really any limits or boundaries to this.
2103180	2104900	For all the information they gathered,
2104900	2108060	the trolls created a wiki, called the Quickie,
2108060	2112440	devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris-Chan data.
2112440	2115620	It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,
2115620	2117660	entire articles about all members
2117660	2119860	of her immediate and extended family,
2120620	2122540	pages of psychiatric records she was tricked
2122540	2125900	into sending them, and that's only the beginning.
2125900	2128280	In their more grandiose moods,
2128280	2131620	the Christorians have speculated that Chris-Chan
2131620	2135260	is the most documented life in all human history,
2135260	2139060	comparing their social experitainment to the Truman Show.
2139060	2141880	It's a level of obsession that surpasses
2141880	2144660	the wildest excesses of Stan culture.
2144660	2148340	It's a gaze into the abyss that does not blink.
2149340	2153860	Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,
2153860	2157340	or on one occasion, sex workers, to the Chandler household.
2157340	2160240	Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates
2160240	2163340	with Chris-Chan, of course, secretly wearing wires
2163340	2165080	to record their conversations.
2165080	2168020	Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends
2168020	2172180	so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.
2172180	2175900	These things must be archived, don't you understand?
2175900	2178380	Chris-Chan must be documented.
2178380	2181580	The absolute low point came when some trolls
2181580	2186580	encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl
2186660	2189540	and have phone sex with Chris-Chan and record it.
2189540	2192780	In other words, they groomed a child
2192780	2196860	to deceive an autistic person into performing sex acts
2196860	2198340	for their entertainment.
2198340	2200900	Now, to contemporary Christorians,
2200900	2204400	this sort of sadistic interference in Christine's life
2204400	2205460	is frowned upon.
2205980	2207260	Not so much because it's immoral,
2207260	2210940	so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,
2210940	2212500	a bit attention-seeking.
2212500	2216100	No, to the sophisticated Christorian,
2216100	2219460	the real pleasure in all this is supposed to lie
2219460	2224460	in quietly spectating, savoring the fine notes of cringe.
2224860	2227380	Now, I take it I don't even need to comment
2227380	2228740	on the morality of all this.
2228740	2232580	The real question to me is why?
2232580	2236180	Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession
2236180	2237980	with Christine Chandler?
2237980	2239740	And yes, it is an obsession.
2239740	2242140	Just to give you a sense of a single individual's
2242140	2246280	personal investment in this, the YouTuber Gino Samuel,
2246280	2249140	one of very few Christorians with the audacity
2249140	2253500	to show his face, has been working for more than two years
2253500	2258020	to produce an eventual 100-episode documentary series
2258020	2260420	about the life of Chris-Chan.
2260420	2263100	Gino has completed 36 episodes so far,
2263100	2265620	and each episode is around 40 minutes long,
2265620	2269460	meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video
2269460	2273060	about the life of what is essentially a random stranger.
2273060	2275900	I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.
2275900	2278220	I'll call it morbid cringe,
2278220	2280420	defined as an obsessive and addictive
2280420	2284900	contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group.
2284900	2287380	Why does morbid cringe happen?
2287380	2288940	Well, I've spent some time
2288940	2292100	poring over Christorians' conversations with each other,
2292100	2294740	and I've even interrogated a couple of them,
2294740	2296340	and this is what I've found.
2296340	2297580	The first thing they'll tell you
2297580	2300140	is that they just think it's funny and entertaining,
2300140	2302520	that Christine's strange life and mind
2302520	2305420	simply appeals to their morbid curiosity,
2305420	2307340	and I'm sure that's true.
2307340	2310020	But a lot of things are funny and entertaining
2310020	2311740	and morbidly interesting.
2311740	2315540	Why fixate on this particular person?
2315540	2318540	Well, for a lot of them, it's a reassurance
2318540	2321820	that there's someone out there worse than them.
2321820	2324600	Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,
2324600	2328200	but at least this defenseless punching bag called Chris-chan
2328200	2331460	is here for them to assert their superiority over.
2331460	2333500	It's pretty much common knowledge
2333500	2335280	that a lot of Christorians,
2335280	2337680	including some of the most vocal haters,
2337680	2339620	are autistic themselves.
2339620	2343660	And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris-chan
2343660	2346980	is that she's giving autistics a bad name.
2346980	2349980	In recent years, there's also been a small contingent
2349980	2354180	of transgender trolls who are likewise prone to say,
2354180	2356540	he's not a real transgender like me
2356540	2359020	and he's making us all look bad.
2360180	2364360	Oh yeah, because people who troll Chris-chan,
2365260	2367620	you guys look amazing.
2367620	2371420	It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this
2371420	2376180	about why trolling Chandler is justified, righteous even,
2376180	2381020	because at the end of the day, trolls are people too.
2381020	2382660	And a lot of them actually do
2382660	2384980	have a guilty conscience about this,
2384980	2387620	which they suppress by insisting
2387620	2390380	that Chris-chan is a horrible person
2390380	2392380	who deserves to be tormented.
2392380	2394380	But trolls who protest too much
2394380	2396660	about the evils of Chris-chan,
2396660	2398940	and therefore reveal the excess
2398940	2401400	of their emotional investment in this,
2401400	2404500	are known in the community as A-logs.
2404500	2406700	A-log is the name of a troll
2406700	2409260	who attracted the ire of other trolls
2409260	2412140	by ranting about Chris-chan's crimes,
2412140	2414300	comparing her to Hitler,
2414300	2418600	and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.
2418600	2420800	Among the trolls, this kind of behavior
2420800	2423540	is considered an embarrassment to all of them
2423540	2427100	because they want to feel like they're just cruelly
2427100	2430380	and casually toying with this person.
2430380	2433300	You know, just for laughs.
2433300	2435260	Not a big deal.
2435260	2440260	This is all perfectly healthy, and normal, and fine.
2441980	2443080	It's fine.
2444300	2447660	But A-log gave the lie to that illusion
2447660	2451020	because it was obvious that his Chris-chan obsession
2451020	2455380	wasn't healthy, or normal, or fine.
2455380	2457380	So the other trolls turned on A-log,
2457380	2459900	and they made him into Chris-chan 2.0,
2459900	2461820	and they uncovered his autism,
2461820	2463740	and his furry porn collection,
2463740	2466520	and his cringy, erotic fan fiction.
2466520	2470020	So why would someone as similar to Chris-chan as A-log
2470020	2471820	obsessively hate on her?
2471820	2473980	Well, there's two explanations.
2473980	2476300	One is troll-shielding.
2476300	2479900	That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris-chan
2479900	2482000	and spearheaded the trolling efforts
2482000	2485900	in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls.
2485900	2489160	The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob
2489160	2491900	by waving your pitchfork the hardest.
2491900	2494440	Obviously, this did not work.
2494440	2498400	The other explanation is that A-log saw himself
2498400	2500480	reflected in Chris-chan,
2500480	2503680	and sort of projected his own shame
2503680	2506200	and self-contempt onto her.
2506200	2509680	A-log hated Chris-chan because he saw part of himself
2509680	2513240	in her, and the other trolls hated A-log
2513240	2516300	because they saw part of themselves in him.
2516300	2517640	To quote Margaret Pless,
2517640	2519400	who covered this story for New York Magazine
2519400	2520440	a few years ago,
2520440	2523280	I think it might be A-log's all the way down.
2523280	2526400	People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-chan
2526400	2528400	because to them she's a symbol
2528400	2530680	of something they hate about themselves,
2530680	2532120	something they're ashamed of.
2532120	2534520	Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum,
2534520	2537000	or being a socially awkward recluse.
2537000	2539800	Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents,
2539800	2543520	or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons,
2543520	2546120	or embarrassing sexual proclivities,
2546120	2547720	or all of the above.
2547720	2550180	This is how scapegoating works, right?
2550180	2552760	You repress your uncomfortable feelings
2552760	2556120	of shame and insecurity and self-loathing,
2556120	2559220	and you displace them onto someone else,
2559220	2562060	usually someone you can feel superior to.
2562060	2565340	Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat,
2565340	2568840	transforming your painful shame and self-loathing
2568840	2572280	into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.
2572280	2575420	It's pretty safe to assume that a large percentage
2575460	2577300	of Christorians and trolls
2577300	2581020	are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris-chan.
2581020	2584340	So bonding together over their shared contempt
2584340	2588620	for Chris-chan is a way of processing the shame and anxiety
2588620	2590800	of social rejection and exclusion.
2590800	2593620	And I think for a lot of people, even normal people
2593620	2596420	who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,
2596420	2598980	contemptuous cringing helps us cope
2598980	2601220	with our own shame and insecurity.
2601220	2604060	Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious empathizing
2604060	2607420	with other people and find a way to make this all about me.
2607420	2609420	♪♪♪
2617420	2619420	♪♪♪
2634060	2636060	♪♪♪
2638700	2639820	Meow meow.
2639820	2642460	Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?
2642460	2646100	Would you like to meet my boyfriend's boyfriend?
2646100	2646940	That's right, honey,
2646940	2649220	I'm giving you fujoshi realness, nya.
2649220	2651540	He's gonna stay right here as a grim reminder
2651540	2653140	of the things that you have seen.
2653140	2655240	Actually, I identify as a trap.
2655240	2656080	It's very that.
2656080	2659180	I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.
2659180	2660980	Cringe is failed seriousness.
2660980	2663920	In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am
2664780	2665960	of being a transgender lesbian.
2665960	2666840	Cringe.
2666840	2667760	Shame.
2667760	2668720	At the end of that video,
2668720	2671080	I talk about how I sense that my shame
2671080	2674040	is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel
2674040	2676040	for a lot of other trans lesbians,
2676040	2679240	particularly those of the heck-and-stripey-sock-nya-nya
2679240	2680600	catgirl variety.
2680600	2683000	But I confess to periodically sinking
2683000	2686640	into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing
2686640	2688560	at embarrassing trans lesbians.
2688560	2689940	I want to return to that thought
2689940	2691960	and kind of psychoanalyze myself
2691960	2694200	as a kind of first-person case study
2694200	2695860	of a morbid cringe obsession.
2695860	2700640	So, catgirl trans girls are,
2700640	2702860	okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.
2702860	2705600	They're trans women, usually attracted to women,
2705600	2708600	who express their identity online
2708600	2713600	through cloying, neotenous, otaku memery.
2713760	2716280	And my conscious reason for cringing at them
2716280	2719560	is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls
2719600	2722160	as a kind of visual baby talk,
2722160	2724920	an infantilized and unrealistic representation
2724920	2726840	of femininity and womanhood
2726840	2729600	that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.
2729600	2733280	So when trans women identify with it, I cringe.
2733280	2737040	Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily.
2737040	2738320	Fuck your dreams.
2738320	2740280	Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked
2740280	2742320	with a discussion of whether my opinions
2742320	2744680	about catgirls are fair or correct.
2744680	2747720	So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.
2747720	2750720	Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.
2750720	2753560	Listen to the contempt beneath my words.
2753560	2756840	Because even if everything I'm saying is true,
2756840	2759880	catgirls are being cringe online
2759880	2762640	is a situation so inconsequential
2762640	2766560	that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much.
2766560	2769440	So why do I have this cringe fixation?
2769440	2773000	Well, according to the A-log theory of morbid cringing,
2773000	2775720	we form obsessive and addictive contempt
2775720	2778280	for people who have traits in common with us,
2778280	2780160	people who make us uncomfortable
2780160	2782880	because we see something of ourselves in them.
2782880	2786560	So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?
2786560	2789320	Well, we're both trans women.
2789320	2791960	We're both attracted to women.
2791960	2796920	I do like anime, but I don't like the anime they like, okay?
2796920	2800280	I like good anime that has mature,
2800280	2802040	three-dimensional female characters.
2802040	2803520	Look, I'm a real transgender, okay?
2803520	2804480	I'm not like you.
2804480	2806320	It's also not lost on me that this is like
2806320	2807960	the seventh time on this channel
2807960	2812080	I've dressed as a catgirl to make fun of them.
2815200	2816640	I have posted cringe.
2816640	2818520	You should all be laughing at me right now.
2818520	2820800	Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.
2820800	2822960	So I do think there's some truth to the idea
2822960	2824840	that I'm A-logging these catgirls.
2824840	2827760	I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.
2827760	2830720	Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe
2830720	2833480	at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,
2833480	2835480	because of how these catgirls are acting.
2835480	2836960	So let's make another distinction
2836960	2839880	between in-group cringe and out-group cringe.
2839880	2841680	In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone
2841680	2844080	who belongs to the same group identity as you,
2844080	2846960	for example, your family, your romantic partnership,
2846960	2848680	your ethnicity, or your country,
2848680	2851040	particularly if they're embarrassing themselves
2851040	2853200	in front of outsiders to the group.
2853200	2855760	Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets
2855760	2858520	if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends.
2858520	2861120	Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get
2861120	2862320	when we talk to foreigners
2862320	2865040	about Donald Trump being our president.
2865040	2866440	Or think about these phrases.
2866440	2868680	She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.
2868680	2870720	They're making trans people look bad.
2870720	2873200	He's giving autistics a bad name.
2873200	2876400	When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,
2876400	2878800	we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment,
2878800	2880800	we feel embarrassment,
2880800	2884280	because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too.
2884280	2888080	So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,
2888080	2890260	because you're cringing at your membership
2890260	2892060	in an embarrassing group.
2892060	2893260	Nothing has ever triggered
2893260	2895860	this kind of in-group embarrassment more for me
2895860	2898660	than a cringe video that went viral last year
2898660	2901900	in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum
2901900	2904460	over being misgendered in a GameStop.
2904460	2906020	You're gonna give me my fucking money back.
2906020	2908980	Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.
2908980	2910900	Excuse me, it's ma'am.
2910900	2912180	It is ma'am.
2912180	2915700	This video is excruciating for me to watch.
2915700	2917420	Motherfucker, take it outside.
2917420	2918740	If you wanna call me sir again,
2918780	2920980	I will show you a fucking sir.
2920980	2921820	Motherfucker.
2924300	2926300	The paradoxical absurdity
2926300	2928980	of trying to brutishly intimidate people
2928980	2930720	into seeing you as a woman.
2933420	2934820	Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this
2934820	2937060	and say Natalie hates trans women who don't pass.
2937060	2940100	But passing is really not what this is about.
2940100	2945020	It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior
2945020	2947420	from a trans woman accompanied by
2947420	2951100	apparently total delusion about how she's presenting.
2951100	2952980	Well, I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time
2952980	2956780	to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not.
2956780	2958780	It's really not that clear, Gorge.
2958780	2961100	And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?
2961100	2963820	The incongruity between her thinking
2963820	2965500	that she's serving women
2965500	2968740	while bellowing like a drill sergeant.
2968740	2970380	By the way, what I'm doing right now,
2970380	2972180	this is cringe reaction content.
2972180	2973540	I don't really do that on this channel,
2973540	2976460	but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.
2976460	2979820	And it feels good, like intoxicatingly good.
2979820	2981980	I can see how you could get addicted to this.
2981980	2985580	I'm imagining myself right now surrounded by cis people
2985580	2987780	and I am leading the righteous mob
2987780	2992780	as we point and laugh at some delusional manly dump truck.
2992860	2996260	I am a real transgender, a true transgender,
2996260	2997820	a good transgender.
2997820	2999860	Father finally approves of me.
2999860	3002780	This would be the unconscious archetypal father.
3002780	3004940	Jot that down in my progress notes, please, doctor.
3004940	3006720	Okay, so why does this feel so good?
3006720	3009060	Well, let me talk you through my feelings.
3009060	3010940	When I watched that GameStop video,
3010940	3012380	for the first few seconds,
3012380	3014660	I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.
3014660	3015860	I can even relate,
3015860	3018200	because in the first couple months of my transition,
3018200	3019540	there was an occasion
3019540	3022740	where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction
3022740	3027100	where the guy at the desk was calling me sir the entire time.
3027100	3028740	And there's something very humiliating
3028740	3030660	about trying to present female,
3030660	3032420	like wearing a dress and makeup,
3032420	3034420	and yet being called sir.
3034420	3037340	It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept
3037340	3038980	and the way other people are seeing you.
3038980	3041100	And the memory of it is painful to me,
3041100	3043900	but what I cling to is that,
3043900	3046100	while I may have looked like a man,
3046100	3048700	at least I didn't act like a man.
3048700	3051340	I didn't threaten to take anyone outside
3051340	3052780	and show them a sir.
3052780	3056100	In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy.
3056100	3058620	So as the GameStop video progresses,
3058620	3060460	my sympathy runs out fast.
3060460	3062340	And instead of compassionate cringe,
3062340	3064420	I feel group embarrassment for trans women,
3064420	3065500	including myself.
3065500	3069180	And I feel contempt toward this individual
3069180	3070780	for making us all look bad.
3070780	3075100	I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear.
3075100	3077720	What if I'm as delusional as that trans woman?
3077720	3079680	I don't look and sound like that, do I?
3079680	3081700	I feel like I have to do a sanity check.
3081700	3083840	I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,
3083840	3086620	listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure.
3086620	3089420	And that fear motivates me to distance myself
3089420	3090920	from that person in the video.
3090920	3092520	I don't feel compassion for her,
3092520	3094360	because that would mean putting myself
3094360	3096000	in her size 16 shoes.
3096000	3097480	And I don't want to do that,
3097480	3099760	because I'm horrified and repulsed by the thought
3099760	3101880	that I'm like her in some way.
3101880	3103440	So I want to push away.
3103440	3106800	And contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself.
3106800	3109480	And if I express that contempt by publicly shaming
3109480	3110680	and condemning her,
3110680	3113360	then I'm also socially distancing myself.
3113360	3115040	Accidental COVID jokes.
3115040	3115880	Oops.
3115880	3118080	Guess it's, uh, contagious.
3118920	3121040	I think many people who are stigmatized
3121040	3123640	or who have been humiliated long
3123640	3126240	for the experience of being a normal,
3126240	3128440	surrounded by fellow normals,
3128440	3131040	judging and humiliating a freak.
3131040	3133160	And if you take a look around trans YouTube,
3133160	3135800	a lot of the biggest creators in the platform
3135800	3138200	have channels basically devoted
3138200	3142060	to exactly this type of cringe-reaction humilitainment.
3142060	3144320	The YouTuber Calvin Guerra is a trans guy
3144320	3146240	who's best known for what are essentially
3146240	3147920	cringe-reaction videos,
3148760	3151240	mostly aimed at people he deems trans-trenders.
3151240	3153520	That is, people who claim to be trans,
3153520	3156600	but who aren't real transgenders like Calvin.
3156600	3159720	He's especially bothered by girly, AFAB,
3159720	3161720	trans and non-binary teenagers,
3161720	3163760	or by anyone who blurs the line
3163760	3166640	between lesbian and trans-masculine identities.
3166640	3168360	Sometimes he'll do a long-form reaction
3168360	3170760	to a specific person who grinds his gears.
3170760	3174680	So this person is an asexual, non-binary,
3174680	3179680	transgender lesbian who uses he, they, it, thons pronouns.
3181640	3185640	According to my calculations, you are a trans-trender.
3185640	3187560	And other times he'll basically just laugh
3187560	3189800	at cringy trans TikTok teens.
3189800	3194120	No, no, I'm turning off the video.
3194120	3195440	I can't watch this.
3195440	3198200	He has a couple justifications for making these videos.
3198200	3199440	One is that he's actually helping
3199440	3200840	the people he's cringing at,
3200840	3202780	because if a trender transitions,
3202780	3205420	then they'll get dysphoria and have to detransition.
3205420	3208820	But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people
3208820	3211460	really help them figure out whether they're trans or not?
3211460	3213740	His other justification is that trans-trenders
3213740	3216180	are giving real trans people a bad name.
3216180	3218100	They're the reason people are transphobic.
3218100	3219860	This is why they hate us.
3219860	3222300	It's because of the trenders.
3222300	3224940	Wow, I love that idea of a true-scum furry.
3224940	3227700	Isn't that just, isn't that just wonderful?
3227700	3229820	A true-scum furry!
3229820	3231100	But it's not, though.
3231100	3233580	I mean, transphobia existed long before
3233580	3235460	there were people you could plausibly describe
3235460	3236700	as trans-trenders.
3236700	3238660	So trans-trenders aren't the reason
3238660	3240780	society hates trans people, Calvin.
3240780	3242740	They're the reason you hate trans people, right?
3242740	3244260	Or at least the trans community.
3244260	3246060	And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting
3246060	3247740	that feeling onto society at large,
3247740	3250020	and you're saying, oh, this is the reason
3250020	3251340	people are transphobic.
3251340	3254020	And to be fair, I get that it's not just a projection.
3254020	3257100	Like back in 2016, the SJW cringe era,
3257100	3259420	it was cis people mocking trans people
3259420	3260700	with all these tropes.
3260700	3263620	Attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders,
3263620	3264820	special snowflakes.
3264820	3266980	But now, they're used by trans people
3266980	3268740	trying to distance themselves,
3268740	3271140	trying to ghettoize the most laughed-at people
3271140	3273940	in the community under the label of trans-trenders.
3273940	3275500	And Calvin, there may be some truth
3275500	3277780	to what you're saying about there being confused teenagers
3277780	3279500	who think they're trans when they're not.
3279500	3280460	I mean, I wouldn't know.
3280460	3282500	I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life,
3282500	3283860	and I don't hang out with teenagers.
3283860	3285420	But even if it is true, Calvin,
3285420	3288600	your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me.
3288600	3291520	Like, you return to this topic to cringe again,
3291520	3294200	and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.
3294200	3296240	It's like you're picking at a wound.
3296240	3298840	It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession.
3298840	3302360	And I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you.
3302360	3304060	This could be me projecting, of course,
3304060	3306180	but I wonder if the way you feel
3306180	3308800	about girly, sparkle-gender AFABs
3308800	3310680	is similar to the way I feel
3310680	3313400	about otaku, trans-bian cat girls.
3313400	3315760	And it might be worth considering that
3315760	3318400	I don't cringe at the sparkle-genders the way you do.
3319160	3320000	I mean, I'm with you on wondering
3320000	3323320	what a he-they-zeer-gender-flux-lesbian-demi-boy is,
3323320	3324880	but unlike you, Calvin,
3324880	3327140	I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession
3327140	3329040	with feminine AFAB trans people.
3329040	3330840	They can identify as however many genders
3330840	3332080	they want for all I care.
3332080	3333640	I may not always understand it,
3333640	3335840	but I support their journey.
3335840	3337360	I guess it doesn't bother me,
3337360	3340000	because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me
3340000	3341520	because of how they behave.
3341520	3343200	I don't feel in-group cringe.
3343200	3344280	Now it's a different story.
3344280	3346440	If I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit
3346600	3348200	and I see a comment like,
3348200	3350760	pre-transition trans-lesbian here.
3350760	3352280	I wish I had titties.
3352280	3353920	Girl, dick, nya nya.
3353920	3355600	Get the fuck out of here, Billy.
3355600	3358000	You're giving real trans-lesbians a bad name.
3358000	3359560	This is why they hate us.
3359560	3362080	See, now I have strong feelings.
3362080	3364160	Now I'm in-group cringing.
3364160	3367760	And intellectually, I do think my feelings are correct
3367760	3368720	to some extent.
3368720	3371600	Like, I don't think a general lesbian community
3371600	3374500	is the appropriate forum for a trans woman
3374540	3376980	who's effectively still living as a man
3376980	3379980	to take the mic and whine about wanting titties
3379980	3382100	or rhapsodize about girl dick.
3382100	3385780	But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this
3385780	3389180	because of my own dysphoria and my own shame.
3389180	3391780	And honestly, my own self-loathing.
3391780	3395400	Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps
3395400	3397100	because I feel like a fake woman
3397100	3399300	imposing myself on real women.
3399300	3400420	That's where my head is at.
3400420	3404160	So where does this pre-transition trans-lesbian
3404160	3405600	get the audacity?
3405600	3407440	You know, it makes me feel in-group cringe
3407440	3410280	about an identity, trans-lesbianism,
3410280	3413880	which for me is already a pain point of insecurity
3413880	3415760	and embarrassment and shame.
3415760	3419320	So Calvin, maybe, and again, I could just be projecting,
3419320	3421280	but maybe that's kind of like
3421280	3423140	how you feel about these trenders.
3423140	3424880	When you make these videos condemning them
3424880	3428540	as not really trans, aren't you essentially exiling them
3428540	3431140	from the in-group so you no longer feel the pain
3431140	3432560	of in-group cringe?
3432600	3435580	Or perhaps, Calvin Garrah,
3435580	3438040	what you're really trying to destroy
3438040	3440120	is the trender within.
3441960	3443920	And again, I could be full of shit here.
3443920	3445080	At the end of the day,
3445080	3448200	this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met.
3448200	3450760	So feel free to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin,
3450760	3454560	but still, I guess I invite you to consider
3454560	3457800	whether producing trans-trender humilitainment
3457800	3459640	is actually helping anything
3459640	3462540	or whether it's really just an addictive way
3462540	3465240	to scratch some kind of emotional itch.
3465240	3467520	All right, I've said my piece about Calvin.
3467520	3468360	Who's next?
3468360	3472120	Oh, how about Vanessa?
3472120	3473680	We meet again, gorge.
3473680	3475000	And once again, I'm wearing some kind
3475000	3477040	of embarrassing anime hairpiece.
3477040	3479600	Vanessa is a trans woman who is
3479600	3482760	the second most popular political trans YouTuber.
3482760	3484560	At least that's what I wrote in the script
3484560	3486240	when I had more subscribers than her
3486240	3488520	and was fully prepared to be a cunt about it,
3488520	3492640	but since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again.
3492640	3493680	Good for her.
3493680	3496680	Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel
3496680	3498960	back when SJW cringe was fashionable.
3498960	3501280	She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,
3501280	3503820	but the most consistent theme was trans-trenders
3503820	3507240	and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name.
3507240	3508640	They're making us look bad.
3508640	3510440	This is why people hate us.
3510440	3512080	So what we can now recognize
3512080	3514680	as a standard in-group cringe fixation.
3514680	3517360	But Vanessa focused in particular
3517400	3522400	on a strident, SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis.
3522520	3525880	And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her
3525880	3528600	where she made a point of misgendering Riley
3528600	3531880	and dismissing her as a fake transgender
3531880	3536240	who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to.
3536240	3539120	You know, if you went on estrogen,
3539120	3540480	your sex drive wouldn't be so high
3540480	3541840	and you wouldn't be guilt-tripping people
3541840	3543840	into having sex with you.
3543840	3544680	Just saying.
3544680	3547480	Then, Riley made a video revealing
3547480	3550120	that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year
3550120	3553480	and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery.
3553480	3556480	This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video
3556480	3558760	where she not only apologized to Riley
3558760	3560400	and acknowledged her transition,
3560400	3562480	but she actually went beyond the script
3562480	3565200	of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube video
3565200	3568280	and opened up about having experienced herself
3568280	3570560	the cruelty she directed at Riley.
3570600	3573280	And I'm someone who's had my transition
3573280	3574800	picked apart online.
3574800	3577000	There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads
3577000	3578800	with hundreds of comments on it
3578800	3580720	of people trying to prove that I'm not trans
3580720	3582480	because I haven't done this or that
3582480	3585080	or, you know, digging up my old pictures.
3585080	3587760	And so the thought that this entire time
3587760	3591800	I've done that exact same thing to someone else
3591800	3594400	and pushed that off on someone else
3594400	3597120	fucks with me and I'm fucking sorry.
3597120	3601040	Vanessa actually managed, for one fleeting moment,
3601040	3605160	to make a connection between her own past hurt and trauma
3605160	3607520	and the pain she'd inflicted on another person,
3607520	3610000	which is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event
3610000	3613920	on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths
3613920	3616960	who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child
3616960	3619440	and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists
3619440	3622040	who consume human misery like a glutton,
3622040	3626000	gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet.
3626000	3628400	You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson
3628400	3632080	that I should really try to stick to ideas,
3632080	3634240	opinions, policy.
3634240	3637480	However, this lesson would not last.
3637480	3640680	Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content
3640680	3643680	well past the point it had become passé,
3643680	3646560	making a video with Big Red in the thumbnail
3646560	3648800	as recently as 2019.
3648800	3652280	I admit, I thought she was fading into irrelevance,
3652280	3655480	but once again, I underestimated Vanessa.
3655480	3658180	In July 2019, her channel rocketed
3658180	3661320	to a new level of success when she released a video
3661320	3666200	titled Exposing Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.
3666200	3670120	In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman,
3670120	3673920	or rather, she believes, a man posing as a trans woman
3673920	3676120	called Jessica Yaniv.
3676120	3679440	Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?
3679440	3682200	Well, as far as I can tell,
3682200	3685880	everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true.
3685880	3689500	Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal
3689500	3691480	to close down several beauty salons
3691480	3693880	that had refused to wax her hairy balls
3693880	3695600	after she approached them about it
3695600	3697320	in an awkward and creepy way.
3697320	3698920	She has a long history of sending
3698920	3702960	extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls.
3702960	3706760	And she attempted to host a topless pool party
3706760	3709000	for unchaperoned children.
3709000	3711640	Basically, Yaniv is someone who appropriates
3711640	3714840	the language of transgender acceptance and equality
3714840	3718120	to cloak predatory behavior toward minors.
3718120	3720280	And my read on Yaniv, by the way,
3720280	3722880	is not that she's a cunning manipulator,
3722880	3726000	but that this is someone who is mentally
3726000	3728080	not playing with a full deck.
3728080	3730320	After the success of her initial video,
3730320	3732960	Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv
3732960	3736960	rebranding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen,
3736960	3741960	exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them.
3742320	3747120	And at first, I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa.
3747120	3748960	At least now she's finally picking on someone
3748960	3750040	who deserves it.
3750040	3754280	But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have.
3754280	3757540	One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story
3757540	3759400	and the lack of attention given to it
3759400	3761320	by other trans public figures
3761320	3764640	as an indictment of trans activists,
3764640	3766800	who Vanessa thinks should spend more time
3766800	3768680	sounding the alarm about
3768680	3771880	TRANSGENDER PREDATORS.
3771880	3773840	And I'm willing to admit,
3773840	3777400	there's probably a valid point in there somewhere.
3777400	3779620	Like, some trans people really are so paranoid
3779620	3782920	about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts
3782920	3785280	that they basically look the other way
3785280	3788440	and refuse to acknowledge the small but real subset
3788440	3792280	of trans people who are, in fact, dangerous perverts.
3792320	3795800	But Blair, you talk about the Yaniv situation
3795800	3797960	like it's urgent breaking news,
3797960	3800640	like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name,
3800640	3803840	but for the stubborn silence of trans activists.
3803840	3805160	But why?
3805160	3808320	Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv?
3808320	3810740	There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults
3810740	3813560	reported to American law enforcement every year.
3813560	3815800	The literal president of America
3815800	3818360	is a bit of a sexual predator himself.
3818360	3822280	Why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep?
3822280	3824400	I guess you could argue that since Yaniv
3824400	3827560	is a trans-identified predator, a tip.
3827560	3831040	We as real trans people have a responsibility
3831040	3833440	to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her.
3833440	3836660	Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that.
3836660	3839240	And again, I think there's maybe some truth to that.
3839240	3842920	Like, initially, the LGBT website Pink News
3842920	3846360	straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination,
3846360	3850080	which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics,
3850080	3853520	but I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates
3853520	3855960	about the transgender threat
3855960	3858380	is really the best optics for us either.
3858380	3861280	Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place?
3861280	3863960	Is it simply because she cares deeply
3863960	3866200	about the well-being of children
3866200	3867920	and she thought making a video
3867920	3872860	exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way to protect them?
3872860	3876080	I mean, I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children,
3876800	3880480	but it's still a YouTube video, and you have to ask,
3880480	3884480	is the primary intention here really to stop a predator?
3884480	3889480	Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle?
3889760	3893000	Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published,
3893000	3895440	Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel
3895440	3900440	titled Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.
3900640	3902680	This got two million views.
3902680	3904520	Is this what you do
3904520	3907680	with someone you've just accused of pedophilia?
3907680	3912000	You host a live event debating the pedophile
3912000	3913640	on your YouTube channel?
3913640	3915120	What's to debate?
3915120	3917120	I don't need to be scared in my own house
3917120	3918400	that I'm gonna get fucking attacked
3918400	3920160	and I'm gonna have to pay money,
3920160	3923400	which is illegal in Canada, just saying, but.
3923400	3924960	You think that was, like, cute?
3927120	3928640	Was that a moment for you?
3928640	3930800	Then, of course, you sell T-shirts
3930800	3932720	featuring the meme that resulted
3932720	3935520	from your YouTube pedophile debate.
3935520	3936960	I mean, that makes sense.
3936960	3939000	If you're gonna catch a predator,
3939000	3941640	you gotta sell pedophile debate merch.
3941640	3943360	And of course, you gotta follow
3943360	3948360	the pedophile's makeup tutorial, you know, for the children.
3949120	3951440	Now, I hate to be overly critical,
3951440	3954040	but when I look at this,
3954040	3956640	I don't see a high-minded activist
3956640	3960120	working to protect children and trans people's image.
3960120	3963240	I see a tabloid entertainer
3963240	3967480	who's discovered a way to monetize milking lols
3967480	3969880	from a mentally defective pervert.
3969880	3973960	And I have to say, Blair, as a connoisseur of trash myself,
3973960	3976240	I'm very entertained by all of this.
3976240	3980280	Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial?
3980280	3982040	That's genius.
3982040	3983560	I wish I'd thought of that.
3983560	3985240	But just be honest.
3985240	3986920	This isn't activism.
3986920	3989080	This isn't justice.
3989080	3990880	It's a lolcow cult.
3990880	3994520	It's like one of Mari's transsexuals took over the show,
3994520	3995960	and I love that for her.
3995960	3997920	I love that for her.
3997920	4001240	But Blair, I can't help but notice
4001240	4003620	you're still hitting all the same beats
4003620	4005640	your videos have always hit.
4005640	4007680	Attention, everyone.
4007680	4011000	There is a bad transgender in our midst.
4011000	4015360	The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.
4015360	4018960	It's very important that we all gather around
4019840	4021840	to condemn this bad transgender
4021840	4023920	who is not a real transgender.
4023920	4025560	And Blair, I'll give you this.
4025560	4027920	You are getting better at choosing your targets.
4027920	4031760	The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture
4031760	4035160	and Jessica Yeniv is good casting for the part.
4035160	4038040	She's a transphobe's boogeyman come to life,
4038040	4040600	and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her.
4040600	4043640	But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously
4043640	4046260	as anything more than a smarter version
4046260	4048800	of the same in-group cringe humilitainment
4049640	4050480	you've always made.
4050480	4052920	And by the way, you may wanna check in
4052920	4055480	on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.
4055480	4058680	Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber
4058680	4061840	who produces a series called Trans Stupid.
4061840	4064320	Hi, everyone, and welcome to another edition
4064320	4066440	of Trans Stupid, the show where I take a look
4066440	4070480	at the wonderful world of LGBTQIA++ news
4070480	4072960	because stupidity is intersectional.
4072960	4074880	Transgender?
4074880	4077740	More like trans-retarded.
4077740	4080180	More like trans-gay.
4080180	4083800	Trans-gay, I love that.
4083800	4086300	I'm literally, I just realized I'm literally trans-gay.
4086300	4089540	Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses
4089540	4091940	of trans ideology and activism,
4091940	4095100	which in theory I do think is a perspective
4095100	4097100	worth including in the conversation.
4097100	4100500	But in practice, well, let's just say,
4100500	4103140	Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary
4103140	4106260	about why Chris Chan is not a real transgender.
4106260	4109460	There is a bad transgender in our midst.
4109460	4113980	The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.
4113980	4115300	I'm getting pretty tired of this.
4115300	4117100	And here's her transition advice
4117100	4119540	to trans women just beginning their journey.
4119540	4120980	You probably have this image in your head
4120980	4125100	that you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman.
4125100	4127460	Like, effectively, you're going to be this seal.
4127460	4128620	Like, look at this seal.
4128620	4130740	Isn't this seal adorable?
4130740	4132500	Look, you're so cute.
4132500	4135140	But the truth is, you're probably not looking
4135140	4136940	like this seal right now, are you?
4136940	4140180	You're probably more like this big bull seal
4140180	4143620	barging your way into women's bathrooms saying,
4143620	4146580	this is a woman's body.
4146580	4150400	Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase.
4150400	4153180	In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.
4153180	4155180	Rose, no.
4155180	4156820	Do not simp for Vanessa.
4156820	4158260	It only encourages her.
4158260	4162960	She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv,
4162960	4165520	which seems like kind of a lot, Gorge.
4165520	4167000	Would I be wrong to say I'm getting
4167000	4169560	a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe?
4169560	4171760	In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's
4171760	4173880	numerous crimes and wrongdoings,
4173880	4177760	but she also cannot resist making it very clear
4177760	4181600	how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance.
4181600	4183640	The irony being that this kind of tweet
4183640	4185720	came from someone who you can smell
4185720	4187800	just by looking at a picture of them.
4187800	4191440	I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest
4191440	4194000	at all in white knighting for Yaniv.
4194000	4195680	I do not support her journey.
4195680	4198340	As far as I'm concerned, she can eat shit,
4198340	4199640	and maybe she does.
4199640	4201000	I wouldn't be surprised.
4201000	4203920	No, my point is that part of the catharsis
4203920	4206240	that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive
4206240	4208740	from making this kind of content
4208740	4211280	comes from contrasting themselves
4211280	4214480	as good, presentable, real trans people
4214480	4219480	with the hideousness of the wretched fake trans dump truck.
4219520	4224520	A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves.
4224640	4227280	On one half, Vanessa.
4227280	4229620	Looking fish, looking cunt.
4235040	4237320	Always with her lip gloss in the live streams.
4237320	4240760	And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast,
4240760	4244680	the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig.
4244680	4246180	And I'm allowed to say dump truck
4246180	4248000	because before I transitioned,
4248000	4249900	I was one of Vanessa's dump trucks.
4249900	4253180	I was one of, hashtag, her dump trucks.
4253180	4256880	Look, I happen to possess a little thing
4256880	4258320	you probably haven't heard of it
4258320	4259640	called inner beauty.
4259640	4263620	That's right, sweetie, my pancreas, unclockable.
4263620	4265480	♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ah ♪
4265480	4268720	Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself
4268720	4272480	with this cartoon, okay,
4272480	4275960	straight up refers to Yaniv as the tubby trune
4276000	4278280	and the titanic tranner of Canada.
4278280	4280640	A particular titanic tranner of Canada.
4280640	4282120	The titanic tranner of Canada.
4282120	4285800	Tranner and trune being pejoratives for transgender
4285800	4288080	that I associate with 4chan,
4288080	4291300	where I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time.
4293040	4296640	As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness,
4296640	4299680	well, I'm guessing that must be another important part
4299680	4301360	of stopping a predator, right?
4301360	4304920	It seems almost taboo to condemn people
4304920	4306440	for how rough they look
4306440	4310280	when I think that that tough love in a way is needed
4310280	4312480	because I look at what I looked like
4312480	4313800	when I first transitioned
4313800	4317240	and Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.
4317240	4319840	Like, I looked bad.
4319840	4321200	Like, I was overweight.
4321200	4324320	I had a poor taste in clothes.
4324320	4326640	Like, I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything.
4326640	4328280	It was mostly t-shirts and jeans.
4328280	4331320	You're probably more like this big bull scene
4331320	4333920	barging your way into women's bathrooms
4333920	4336720	saying, this is a woman's body.
4337720	4340200	Now, you might never reach me.
4340200	4341920	You'd see the face, in fact,
4341920	4344240	very few of us turn out to look like black whites.
4344240	4345320	And I want to make it very clear
4345320	4347440	that when I'm talking about transition,
4347440	4349200	I don't mean that you're-
4349200	4352120	Rose, are you okay?
4352120	4353760	No, you're not okay.
4353760	4355160	None of us are okay.
4355160	4357920	No trans woman remotely in the public eye
4357920	4359720	is in any way okay.
4359720	4362640	And look, I don't want to take the psychoanalysis too far
4362640	4365120	because I don't know from watching YouTube videos
4365120	4366760	what's going on in someone's head,
4366760	4369480	but I can try to make intelligent inferences.
4369480	4371320	And I think it's pretty revealing
4371320	4374160	that this is how Rose introduces the topic
4374160	4375520	of Jessica Yaniv.
4375520	4378200	I think, well, one of the biggest characters
4378200	4380720	in the whole fucking world at the moment,
4380720	4383040	which is Jessica Yaniv.
4383040	4385440	Rose, Gorge,
4386320	4388960	Jessica Yaniv is not one of
4389040	4394040	the biggest characters in the whole world at any moment.
4394280	4396520	This is not a world historical figure.
4396520	4397840	At the end of the day,
4397840	4400680	this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend
4400680	4402760	off the streets of Vancouver, BC.
4402760	4404960	The only reason anyone has heard of her at all
4404960	4407760	is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch a predator
4407760	4411360	and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.
4411360	4413640	She is not one of the most important characters
4413640	4414480	in the world,
4414480	4416720	but it sounds like what she is, Rose,
4416760	4419920	is one of the most important characters in your brain.
4419920	4421560	This is distorted thinking.
4421560	4424320	It's like A-Log comparing Chris-Chan to Hitler.
4424320	4426720	You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession
4426720	4428320	that you've lost perspective.
4428320	4430000	And I'm sure you have what seemed to you
4430000	4431880	like perfectly logical reasons
4431880	4434040	why you're devoting so much attention to this.
4434040	4436520	And I know videos about Yaniv get a lot of views,
4436520	4438120	so I'm sure that's a factor too.
4438120	4441240	But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession
4441240	4442120	when I see one.
4442120	4445400	And I know that being a visible trans woman on the internet
4445400	4448000	is more difficult than most people can imagine.
4448000	4450640	And I know that pretty much every trans person
4450640	4452760	is bullied or shamed or humiliated
4452760	4454360	at some point in our lives.
4454360	4456680	And I know how good it can feel
4456680	4459600	to take all the horrible things transphobes and bullies
4459600	4461640	and TERFs have said about us
4461640	4466640	and repeat them verbatim about some big, fat, fake,
4466660	4470440	dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist.
4470440	4473320	Oh, it feels good to be the TERF for once.
4473320	4476760	It feels good to be the judge rather than the judged.
4476760	4479000	Because when you point the finger at someone else,
4479000	4482280	you're also pointing away from yourself.
4482280	4485280	And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles,
4485280	4486640	queer people are often treated
4486640	4489240	like suspected sex criminals by default.
4489240	4491940	So there's safety in being the one who spearheads
4491940	4494440	the think-of-the-children type moral crusade.
4494440	4497560	And when you expose a trans predator,
4497560	4501240	you get that feeling of safety plus the relief
4501240	4504040	of having someone in particular to blame
4504040	4506440	for the shame and stigma we all feel.
4506440	4509760	Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us,
4509760	4511160	but that's just not true.
4511160	4514000	It's a simple answer to a complicated problem.
4514000	4515640	It's scapegoating.
4515640	4518760	When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube,
4518760	4522600	I see a community trying to cope with stigma
4522600	4526280	and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief.
4526280	4529080	It's basically a blood sacrifice.
4529080	4530520	It's not rational.
4530520	4534000	It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction.
4534000	4536960	It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame.
4536960	4540480	And Yaniv is simply the latest and most deserving
4540480	4543680	in a long line of bad transgenders
4543680	4546920	who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name
4546920	4548520	and are the reason people hate us
4548520	4550760	and must be condemned and destroyed.
4550760	4552840	But when Yaniv is finally gone,
4552840	4555440	when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is,
4555440	4558600	you're just gonna find a new scapegoat to take her place.
4558600	4560800	And the shame cycle continues.
4560800	4563360	The humiliation and bullying we've experienced
4563360	4565040	is internalized as shame.
4565040	4567240	When we project that shame onto scapegoats
4567240	4570800	and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt,
4570800	4574440	and we voice that contempt by shaming other people,
4574440	4576280	which starts a new cycle.
4576280	4579440	So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags,
4579440	4581360	new shame dumps, new lolcows,
4581360	4583040	and you can end up like one of the people
4583040	4586000	who's been archiving Chris Chan for 13 years,
4586000	4588160	but that will never really heal us.
4588160	4589920	God, how do I get out of this video?
4589920	4592400	Ugh, I'm trying to have a serious conversation
4592400	4594360	dressed as some sort of catgirl degenerate.
4594360	4595320	Cringe.
4595320	4596160	Shame.
4596160	4597540	I'm ashamed.
4597540	4598380	Don't look at me.
4599320	4603040	You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers.
4603040	4605840	Thank you, yes, I suppose it is groundbreaking.
4605840	4609480	All right, children, let's review our notes on cringe.
4609480	4612560	The word cringe really describes two different emotions,
4612560	4614680	either embarrassment or contempt.
4614680	4618040	You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else.
4618880	4619720	When you're embarrassed for someone else,
4619720	4621600	we call that vicarious embarrassment.
4621600	4623440	And that can mean cringing with someone
4623440	4624720	who is embarrassed themselves,
4624720	4626680	which I've argued is excluded
4626680	4628760	in the internet usage of the word cringe.
4628760	4630920	Or it can mean embarrassment for someone
4630920	4632920	who isn't embarrassed themselves,
4632920	4635440	in which case we say we're cringing at them.
4635440	4637240	Now if someone who's part of your in-group
4637240	4638680	is embarrassing themselves,
4638680	4642180	and by proxy, embarrassing the in-group that includes you,
4642180	4644080	you feel in-group cringe,
4644080	4646880	which can involve both vicarious embarrassment
4646880	4648920	and a kind of self-cringe.
4648920	4650200	And on the contempt side,
4650200	4653240	contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you,
4653240	4654480	particularly if they're traits
4654480	4656480	you have contempt for in yourself,
4656480	4658800	can develop into morbid cringe,
4658800	4660960	which is that obsession with a lolcow,
4660960	4664560	that addiction to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror
4664560	4665840	in which you see reflected
4665840	4669080	everything you hate about yourself or about your in-group.
4669080	4671080	Now I wanna end this video by reflecting
4671080	4674440	on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful.
4674440	4677960	And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good.
4677960	4680360	Embarrassment serves a social purpose.
4680360	4682880	It helps us interact smoothly with each other
4682880	4684780	by telling us what not to do.
4684780	4687300	And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories
4687300	4688360	can be cathartic.
4688360	4690600	It can make you feel closer to other people,
4690600	4692480	more alike, less alone.
4692480	4694840	I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe
4694840	4695840	is very healthy.
4695840	4697560	It shows you're self-aware,
4697560	4700220	and you care at least a little bit what other people think.
4700220	4702760	You know, I've met people who never cringe at themselves,
4702760	4706000	and let's just say they're not my kind of people.
4706000	4709120	They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves,
4709120	4711560	regardless of how they're actually coming across.
4711560	4713240	But I think partly out of fear
4713240	4715340	of ending up like one of those people,
4715340	4718400	I've overcompensated, and I cringe too much,
4718400	4720680	both at myself and at other people.
4720680	4724160	It's a habit that's kind of making me hate myself,
4724160	4727460	and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others.
4727460	4729060	And when I take a look around the internet,
4729060	4731000	like I've done in this video,
4731040	4734400	I find that I'm not alone in this situation,
4734400	4735720	and it's not cute.
4735720	4737880	So how do we cringe less?
4737880	4740240	Well, the cliche solution is self-love,
4740240	4742560	which our culture places a lot of value on.
4742560	4744560	Self-love and self-esteem.
4744560	4747800	You know, I don't care what haters and losers say.
4747800	4749200	I'm a bad bitch.
4749200	4750840	I look like a supermodel.
4750840	4752440	I'm a genius.
4752440	4755040	We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way,
4755040	4757540	but it doesn't work, because it's not realistic.
4757540	4760440	You don't look like a supermodel, and you're not a genius.
4760440	4761720	And when you realize that,
4761720	4763640	you fall from one extreme to the other
4763640	4765000	of what Chris Fleming calls
4765000	4767160	the self-esteem tower of terror.
4767160	4769560	You go from self-love to self-hate.
4769560	4771760	But self-hate is also a distortion.
4771760	4772680	Recently, I was listening
4772680	4774760	to a David Foster Wallace interview.
4774760	4776280	Yeah, I know, cringe.
4776280	4778840	And he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked.
4778840	4781760	There's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.
4781760	4784280	How dare you notice that?
4784280	4786560	I'm in this photo, and I don't like it.
4786560	4787880	But it's true.
4787880	4790000	Time spent cringing at yourself
4790000	4793040	is still time spent obsessing over yourself.
4793040	4795800	And it's hard not to, because humans are animals,
4795800	4799040	so our perspective is egocentric by nature.
4799040	4801280	But we can still learn to appreciate
4801280	4803320	that the world is bigger than us.
4803320	4804480	I mean, I've heard rumors.
4804480	4806920	In that book we started with, Cringeworthy,
4806920	4810400	Melissa Dahl advocates not self-love or self-hate,
4810400	4813320	but what she calls self-indifference.
4813320	4814160	She says,
4814280	4817920	Self-indifference is the relief of realizing
4817920	4821480	that you are simply not that big a deal.
4821480	4823920	So yeah, I was pretty cringey in the past,
4823920	4826520	and I'm still pretty cringey now.
4826520	4827960	But you know what?
4827960	4830360	Everyone else is pretty cringey too.
4830360	4832840	And the world's probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway,
4832840	4835560	so I don't know if I would call this good news,
4835560	4838020	but if it's any consolation,
4839280	4841080	nothing matters.
4841080	4843000	Nothing matters.
4843040	4844800	Nothing matters.
4844800	4846480	Nothing matters.
4846480	4848240	Nothing matters.
4848240	4850120	Nothing matters.
4850120	4852080	Nothing matters.
4852080	4853400	Nothing matters.
4854240	4856000	Nothing matters.
4856000	4857840	Nothing matters.
4857840	4859720	Nothing matters.
4859720	4861720	Nothing matters.
