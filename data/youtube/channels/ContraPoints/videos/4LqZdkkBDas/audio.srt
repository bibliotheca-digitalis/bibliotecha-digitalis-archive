1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Tis evident, nor sensation, nor the passions, Possess dominion over the mind of man,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Which is ruled instead by a reason Sovereign of all faculties.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It must needs be remarked that the power of the Commonwealth

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Deriveth not from the despotical acquisitions of conquerors,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But from that covenant amongst men whereby they most resembleth the lobster.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So much for the tolerant Jacobins.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Reason. Power. Truth.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
These are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So who's Jordan Peterson?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Wow. He's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
under Canadian human rights law shall surely lead to Stalinism.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the Western world,

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and his self-help book Twelve Rules for Life is a national and international bestseller.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here because I want to talk.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson haven't really engaged with his ideas very much.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
where Kathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So you're saying that by and large women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they deserve?

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, I'm saying that that's one component.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No. That's murderous.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're just saying these things, though, to provoke, aren't you?

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I mean, you are a provocateur.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I never say anything.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are, like, afraid of his actual ideas.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I'm not afraid of his ideas. I'm not afraid of anything.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Daddy.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and reading his books, and honestly, I think I get why people like him.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker, and as a kind of life coach.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
His book, Twelve Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People or Rick Warren's The Purpose-Driven Life.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
take responsibility for yourself, don't envy other people,

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and he renews them with the intellectual trappings of psychology, philosophy,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's telling us a pretty classic story.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering,

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
so you need a higher purpose in your life.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I knew that already. I learned it at the AA meetings I refused to go to.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
These are like basic insights of world philosophy and religion,

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but they're insights that today's youths apparently haven't heard before.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
so to a lot of people, Peterson's ideas seem new and urgent.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Most of Peterson's fans are young men, and I mean someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape,

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and if Peterson can do that, more power to him.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy, and sometimes girls do too.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But there's a big problem here.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And the problem is that all of this life coaching is basically just a Trojan horse

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
for a reactionary political agenda.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help not merely as a guide to private life,

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
but as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why not?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Now Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics because that doesn't sound scary enough.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
His new, scarier word is

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
postmodern neomarxism.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neomarxism with cultural marxism,

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the Nazi conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
See, this is not the same thing as that, right? Right?

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist, and you may quote me on that,

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but I am wondering, if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neomarxism?

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Professor. Daddy. Let's talk.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
For once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mmm, that's good. That's a good temperature.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thanks, Daddy.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's really an honor to bathe with a public intellectual of your stature.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, I never like to argue in the bath, so I want to start by telling you the things I like about you.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the left,

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the stifling of even slightly different opinions,

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments,

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the politics of resentment,

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh god, the dysphoria. Please don't watch it.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very localized problem,

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Like, fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists,

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights,

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that would be bad, right?

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom,

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but, clearly, the sheep need a shepherd,

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know, in the left, we don't really tell people what to do.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We tell them what not to do.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't exploit the workers.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do not do blackface.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people,

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but that's a pretty small rule compared to some of your rules,

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
like how to raise your children, or when it's okay to criticize things.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
were talking about Plato and Aristotle and the meaning of life,

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and I thought, huh, on the left, we don't really talk about that kind of thing.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All we talk about is how society oppresses people,

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and that might not be enough,

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because people need to have a positive purpose in life.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
of Strangers with Candy until I die.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus,

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
other white guys who talk about lobsters,

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering,

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and like, not just complain about patriarchy.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
when patriarchy isn't the thing that's making you suffer.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I do think that an education that only teaches people about oppression

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is inadequate.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad,

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and then we say, well, you're educated now,

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that really kinda sucks.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
without comparing transgender activism to Stalin.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
See, this is why you've gotta use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you don't establish dominance, I'm just gonna mouth off.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They use all this compassion language,

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and I'm on the side of the oppressed,

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
all of that posturing,

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
it does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I've just been starting to review their curriculum

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
for children from kindergarten to grade 8.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's pure social justice, postmodernism.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The people who hold this doctrine,

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
this radical postmodern communitarian doctrine

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
or some kind of group identity paramount,

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
they've got control over most low-to-mid-level bureaucratic structures.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And many governments as well,

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but even in the United States where...

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you gotta give it to JP.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When he says stand up straight with your shoulders back, he means it.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
with fairly popular opinions.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Political correctness often feels stifling.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use,

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and I don't like it.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But once he draws you in with these inviting preludes,

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
he leads you to a pretty weird place.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
His central political message is that leftist professors,

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
student activists, campus diversity initiatives,

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and corporate HR departments

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
are collectively following the philosophy of postmodern neo-Marxism

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to destroy Western civilization

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now there's just no avoiding that this idea is actually pretty similar

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to the cultural Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory,

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
but I'm just gonna ignore that because if I dwell on it,

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and then everyone will think I'm crazy.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't have anything to hide.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So let's just try not to think about that

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and instead straightforwardly ask,

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is it true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out to destroy us all?

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We all know what Marxism is,

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the idea that society should be understood as a class struggle

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
between workers and capitalists,

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and that the workers will eventually revolt.

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Some college professors definitely do believe that,

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but 0% of corporate HR departments do,

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
so... that... okay.

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So what is postmodernism?

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Some people try to explain it by listing all the things that are called postmodern

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
trying to guess what they have in common.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's basically what the YouTuber Armored Skeptic did in his video about it.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So many daddies in this video.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We should invite them all to a barbecue,

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
complain about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've had worse evenings.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't think there really is a common thread linking all the things called postmodern.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Basically postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that seemed new at the time.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism,

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He's talking about postmodern philosophy.

197
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So what's that?

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well... basically it's a kind of skepticism.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Not YouTube skepticism,

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
but actual skepticism.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know, like having doubts about whether humans can really know things about the world.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That goes way back to ancient times.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But more specifically, postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So what's modernism?

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What's what?

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are words?

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What's anything?

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm gonna divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
First, there's early modernism.

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Early modernism is the philosophy developed by a bunch of boring 18th century queens

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which says that we can form universal theories about the world

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
through observation and reasoning, a.k.a. the scientific method.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now that turns out to work pretty well

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
for whatever questions you have about plants and crystals

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and how to medically reconfigure human genitals,

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
but it has some limits,

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
which was pointed out by David Hume,

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
one of the least boring 18th century queens

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and one of the only philosophers I can actually put up with in small doses

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish.

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is a call-out.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you can't really know much about important things like morality, causation, and the self

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Anyway, then the late modernists came along and they said,

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
fuck Hume, we're gonna do science about those things anyway.

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
who one way or another tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So for example, you have psychoanalysis,

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
which said human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives,

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
which is of course ridiculous, I'm conscious of all my drives,

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat,

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you got early sociology and anthropology,

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
which started out with racist social evolutionism

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and progressed to a kind of we're-all-the-same universalism.

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
His first book, Maps of Meaning,

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and create order out of chaos through universal myths and archetypes,

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Boy, this is a lot of explaining.

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's so much explaining, it's triggering gender dysphoria.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I better put on some longer nails.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Nails? Is that all womanhood means to you?

246
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism,

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
so whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
about reality, history, and humanity,

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
postmodernists say, actually, no, that's not possible.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
For example, the French postmodernist Michel Foucault

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sargon? You little goose.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Michel Foucault wrote intellectual histories of subjects

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
in which he argued that we should not understand these histories

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
as straightforward progressions toward liberty and scientific truth,

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but rather as mere shifts in the way that power

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
orders our institutions and populations.

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
irony being the skeptical caution with which we should regard

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
our own beliefs and our awareness that our vocabulary

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
for describing and understanding the world

266
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
is not the final or best vocabulary.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
All right, that's enough explaining, and my nails are done.

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Check it out.

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails,

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
with barely concealed visceral rage?

272
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, I have a solution for you.

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The bisexual manicure.

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
One hand for the V, one hand for the D.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Both for degeneracy.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's absolutely filthy.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So we've got all the pieces on the table.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
On the one hand, we have Marxism,

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
a fundamentally modernist worldview

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
On the other hand, we have postmodernism,

283
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity

284
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to know any universal truth is about anything.

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
are not compatible.

287
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre calling Foucault

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.

290
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died,

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
capitalism did end forever.

292
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neomarxism?

293
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists

294
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
were in some way influenced by Marxism,

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.

296
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But that's not what Peterson means.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's clear from the way he uses the term

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
than it initially appears.

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Peterson uses the term postmodern neomarxism

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to include not only postmodern intellectuals

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and Marxist intellectuals,

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but also liberal politicians, academic administrators,

304
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and so-called identity politics activists,

306
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.

308
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism

309
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
are fundamentally at odds,

310
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
since Marxism is a big story about a struggle

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
between two clear and distinct groups,

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and about the stability of binaries

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
like bourgeoisie and proletariat.

315
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But that's not the only tension in Peterson's

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
clusterfuck idea of postmodern neomarxism.

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows

318
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that Marxists and identity politics activists

319
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
are constantly at each other's throats,

320
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
because the Marxists accuse the activists

321
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of being bourgeois dogs who want more female CEOs of color

322
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and more disabled transgender drone pilots,

323
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
while the activists accuse the Marxists

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of being a boys' club of brocialists

325
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
no more woke on gender and race issues

326
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
than the average Jordan Peterson fan.

327
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Most often, these accusations are correct,

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
because everyone is problematic, and I disown them all.

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And then there's also the conflict

330
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
between the identity politics activists

331
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and the postmodernists.

332
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's nothing postmodern about it.

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
for particular groups, such as women, people of color,

336
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and gay and trans people.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This kind of activism presupposes

338
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that these group categories exist

339
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and are a useful basis for political organizing.

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.

341
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They want to show that these categories

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
race, gender, sexual orientation

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
are contingent social constructs

344
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and are themselves potentially oppressive.

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is why conventional feminist activists

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
often hate postmodern feminism,

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
because the postmodern feminists want to show

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance,

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is contingent and potentially oppressive,

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and they think we should be working

351
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to destabilize and undermine it.

352
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And then the conventional feminist activists say,

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the fuck? We need the concept of womanhood

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to organize around women's political interests.

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
How are we supposed to do that

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,

358
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler,

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the most famous postmodern feminist ever.

360
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics

361
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
when identity becomes its own policy,

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And this is not a call to return to silence or invisibility,

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
but rather to make use of a category

365
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that can be called into question,

366
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
made to account for what it excludes.

367
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you take the first part of that quote out of context,

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
it almost sounds like something Jordan Peterson could have said.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The difference is that JP actually does think

370
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
we should return to silence and invisibility.

371
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Or does he?

372
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's hard to tell what he thinks.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
More on that in a moment.

374
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I bring all of this up to show that 1.

375
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The idea of postmodern neomarxist identity politics

376
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical,

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and 2.

378
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Identity politics is not this dogma that must go unquestioned.

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are sophisticated debates about this

380
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
going on within leftist academia,

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but JP either doesn't know that or doesn't care.

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He uses the term postmodern neomarxism

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
bent on destroying western civilization,

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
who can't stop squabbling with each other

387
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
over every goddamn little issue.

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The only reason I can think of

389
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force

390
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is if you're so far to the right

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that literally everyone who supports

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
the economic and social advancement of disadvantaged groups

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
looks like one homogenous enemy.

394
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But is that what JP is saying?

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That he opposes all social progress

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
for women, racial, and sexual minorities?

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, it's difficult to say,

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
because while he spends much of his time

399
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
comparing activists for these movements

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
to 20th century mass murderers,

401
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
he resists being pinned down to any more specific position.

402
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier.

403
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
She came out of that interview looking bad,

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
but she had a tough job to do.

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves

406
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
saying something that's more or less uncontroversially true,

407
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
while at the same time implying something controversial.

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
there are biological differences between men and women,

410
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
which is obviously true.

411
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But he'll say it in the context of a conversation

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
about the underrepresentation of women in government,

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
which implies... what, exactly?

414
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So how do you respond to this?

415
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing

416
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
against the obviously true statement,

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
where you have to guess at what he's implying,

418
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
in response to which he can accuse you of misrepresenting him,

419
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview.

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The most famous moment where Peterson does this

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is the notorious lobster argument.

422
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So he starts by saying...

423
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There's this idea that hierarchical structures

424
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy.

425
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies

426
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're saying that we should organize our societies

429
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
along the lines of the lobsters.

430
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity

431
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.

432
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The problem with that is that no one has ever said

433
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that every hierarchy is the product of Western patriarchy.

434
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is such a massive strawman

435
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation of Peterson

436
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview.

437
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies,

439
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.

440
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.

441
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender, race, and economics

442
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
within our own society, to which the lobster case is a complete non sequitur.

443
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument the same way he uses it

444
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to justify literally any hierarchy or authority, no matter how unjust.

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You could be an 18th century Republican arguing against the monarchy,

446
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and the monarch could turn around and say,

447
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
well, hierarchies are inevitable. God save the lobster queen.

448
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, dear God.

449
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
My lords, ladies, and those at length betwixt,

450
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
present rumors of Republican rumblings amongst the rabble

451
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
have compelled us to summon you together.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let us remind you that nature hath so made the lobster

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that some individuals be stronger than the others.

454
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty

455
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
be anywise impugned.

456
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And as for parliamentarians,

457
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
well, let them vote for cake.

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Very good. Thank you.

459
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I need new roommates.

460
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So I've argued that Peterson is invoking the incoherent concept

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
of postmodern neo-Marxism as the supervillain

462
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
in a childishly simple worldview he's promoting

463
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
where these evil leftists are out to destroy the West.

464
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Now, it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.

465
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What, exactly, is the West?

466
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West

467
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that describes the intellectual tradition

468
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.

469
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Now, a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of the West

470
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary and supremacist

471
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and justifies imperialism and all that kind of thing.

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But we don't have time for that right now,

473
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
so I'm just gonna grant that the West is a thing

474
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.

475
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
For Peterson, the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism, individualism,

476
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the idea that each human has a spark of divinity

477
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,

478
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a term more popular with conservative pundits than intellectual historians.

479
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values with postmodern neo-Marxism,

480
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
which he describes as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.

481
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms of geographical chauvinism

482
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and external threat is inaccurate and scaremongering.

483
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Marxism is Western philosophy. Postmodernism is Western philosophy.

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
If you're really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries

485
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
of the intellectual tradition, you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.

486
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology that is meaningfully non-Western.

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs

488
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
over collective dogma should be on board with.

490
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy,

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty.

492
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson talk about the Western tradition,

493
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.

494
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If you did read it, you'd find a surprising diversity of thought

495
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.

496
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Much of Plato's political dialogues are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
suggesting that, far from being an invention of postmodernity,

498
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
it was actually a pretty popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts.

499
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David Hume famously said that reason is

500
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and ought only to be the slave of the passions, literally feels over reels.

501
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And meanwhile, his contemporary the Marquis de Sade was advocating the abolition of morality,

502
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
filling the churches with scat porn,

503
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion so decadent and depraved

504
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.

505
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and it's just as much a part of the West as Peterson's soggy, Bible-padding conservatism.

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But again, and I really can't stress this enough, I don't care either way.

508
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.

509
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, what do you people want from me?

510
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The Lobster Queen is dead. Long live the Queen.

511
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Can't save the Lobster Queen.

512
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Long live the Lobster Queen.

513
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Can't save the Queen.

514
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Stabbing through the skin with those crustaceans.

515
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Can't save the Lobster Queen.

Stabbing through the skin with those crustaceans.

517
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Where are those people?

518
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in,

519
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that I watch her, and I don't mean to misgender her because I think she identifies with her,

520
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
ContraPoints, I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber.

521
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I've seen the name come up every now and again on Twitter.

522
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Totally disagree with everything this person says,

523
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but I look at it and I'm like, this seems very reasonable, educated, academic,

524
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and I'm seeing reasons to hope that everyone's going to like her.

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hello, Dave.
