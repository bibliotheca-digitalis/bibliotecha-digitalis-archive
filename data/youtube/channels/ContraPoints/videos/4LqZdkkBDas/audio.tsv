0	6000	My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt,
6000	12000	Tis evident, nor sensation, nor the passions, Possess dominion over the mind of man,
12000	17000	Which is ruled instead by a reason Sovereign of all faculties.
21000	25000	It must needs be remarked that the power of the Commonwealth
25000	29000	Deriveth not from the despotical acquisitions of conquerors,
29000	35000	But from that covenant amongst men whereby they most resembleth the lobster.
60000	62000	So much for the tolerant Jacobins.
68000	71000	Reason. Power. Truth.
71000	74000	These are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.
74000	78000	Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.
78000	80000	So who's Jordan Peterson?
80000	87000	Wow. He's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto,
87000	91000	who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people
91000	95000	under Canadian human rights law shall surely lead to Stalinism.
95000	98000	Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.
98000	102000	David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the Western world,
102000	107000	and his self-help book Twelve Rules for Life is a national and international bestseller.
107000	110000	I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.
110000	115000	He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here because I want to talk.
115000	120000	A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson haven't really engaged with his ideas very much.
120000	125000	He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview
125000	130000	where Kathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.
130000	134000	So you're saying that by and large women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they deserve?
134000	136000	No, I'm saying that that's one component.
136000	139000	You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?
139000	140000	No. That's murderous.
140000	142000	You're just saying these things, though, to provoke, aren't you?
142000	143000	I mean, you are a provocateur.
143000	144000	I never say anything.
144000	146000	You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.
146000	151000	You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters?
151000	156000	I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are, like, afraid of his actual ideas.
156000	159000	But I'm not afraid of his ideas. I'm not afraid of anything.
159000	161000	I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.
161000	168000	Daddy.
168000	172000	So I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts
172000	177000	and reading his books, and honestly, I think I get why people like him.
177000	181000	Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker, and as a kind of life coach.
181000	185000	His book, Twelve Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's
185000	190000	The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People or Rick Warren's The Purpose-Driven Life.
190000	193000	The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like
193000	197000	take responsibility for yourself, don't envy other people,
197000	201000	and he renews them with the intellectual trappings of psychology, philosophy,
201000	204000	Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.
204000	206000	He's telling us a pretty classic story.
206000	210000	Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering,
210000	212000	so you need a higher purpose in your life.
212000	216000	But I knew that already. I learned it at the AA meetings I refused to go to.
216000	219000	These are like basic insights of world philosophy and religion,
219000	223000	but they're insights that today's youths apparently haven't heard before.
223000	226000	I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.
226000	229000	Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with,
229000	233000	so to a lot of people, Peterson's ideas seem new and urgent.
233000	236000	And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.
236000	241000	Most of Peterson's fans are young men, and I mean someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape,
241000	244000	and if Peterson can do that, more power to him.
244000	248000	I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy, and sometimes girls do too.
250000	252000	But there's a big problem here.
252000	256000	And the problem is that all of this life coaching is basically just a Trojan horse
256000	258000	for a reactionary political agenda.
258000	262000	Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help not merely as a guide to private life,
262000	268000	but as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.
268000	272000	There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?
273000	274000	Why not?
274000	278000	The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.
278000	283000	Now Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics because that doesn't sound scary enough.
283000	285000	His new, scarier word is
285000	289000	postmodern neomarxism.
289000	294000	Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neomarxism with cultural marxism,
294000	299000	the Nazi conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.
299000	302000	See, this is not the same thing as that, right? Right?
302000	307000	So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist, and you may quote me on that,
307000	312000	but I am wondering, if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals
312000	316000	plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neomarxism?
316000	319000	Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.
319000	321000	So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson.
321000	325000	Professor. Daddy. Let's talk.
325000	331000	For once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves.
340000	343000	Mmm, that's good. That's a good temperature.
343000	345000	Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?
347000	349000	Thanks, Daddy.
349000	353000	It's really an honor to bathe with a public intellectual of your stature.
355000	360000	You know, I never like to argue in the bath, so I want to start by telling you the things I like about you.
360000	363000	The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the left,
363000	366000	the stifling of even slightly different opinions,
366000	369000	the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments,
369000	371000	the politics of resentment,
371000	376000	are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.
376000	380000	I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person.
380000	382000	Oh god, the dysphoria. Please don't watch it.
382000	388000	But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very localized problem,
388000	393000	and I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.
393000	397000	Like, fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists,
397000	403000	but if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights,
403000	405000	that would be bad, right?
407000	410000	I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.
410000	413000	I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom,
413000	417000	but, clearly, the sheep need a shepherd,
417000	419000	and you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.
419000	421000	You know, in the left, we don't really tell people what to do.
421000	423000	We tell them what not to do.
423000	424000	Don't exploit the workers.
424000	426000	Do not do blackface.
426000	428000	I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people,
428000	431000	but that's a pretty small rule compared to some of your rules,
431000	436000	like how to raise your children, or when it's okay to criticize things.
437000	440000	The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.
440000	444000	I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons
444000	447000	were talking about Plato and Aristotle and the meaning of life,
447000	452000	and I thought, huh, on the left, we don't really talk about that kind of thing.
452000	454000	All we talk about is how society oppresses people,
454000	456000	and that might not be enough,
456000	459000	because people need to have a positive purpose in life.
459000	461000	I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.
461000	464000	I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons
464000	466000	of Strangers with Candy until I die.
466000	469000	But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus,
469000	472000	other white guys who talk about lobsters,
472000	476000	they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering,
476000	479000	and like, not just complain about patriarchy.
479000	481000	I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy
481000	483000	when patriarchy isn't the thing that's making you suffer.
483000	487000	But I do think that an education that only teaches people about oppression
487000	488000	is inadequate.
488000	491000	We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad,
491000	494000	and then we say, well, you're educated now,
494000	497000	good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!
497000	499000	And that really kinda sucks.
499000	503000	But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made
503000	506000	without comparing transgender activism to Stalin.
508000	511000	I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.
511000	514000	See, this is why you've gotta use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.
514000	517000	If you don't establish dominance, I'm just gonna mouth off.
518000	520000	They use all this compassion language,
520000	522000	and I'm on the side of the oppressed,
522000	524000	all of that posturing,
524000	527000	it does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.
527000	530000	And I've just been starting to review their curriculum
530000	532000	for children from kindergarten to grade 8.
532000	535000	It's pure social justice, postmodernism.
535000	538000	The people who hold this doctrine,
538000	541000	this radical postmodern communitarian doctrine
541000	545000	that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity
545000	547000	or some kind of group identity paramount,
547000	553000	they've got control over most low-to-mid-level bureaucratic structures.
553000	556000	And many governments as well,
556000	558000	but even in the United States where...
575000	591000	So you gotta give it to JP.
591000	594000	When he says stand up straight with your shoulders back, he means it.
594000	598000	So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences
598000	600000	with fairly popular opinions.
600000	602000	Political correctness often feels stifling.
602000	605000	Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.
605000	608000	Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use,
608000	609000	and I don't like it.
609000	612000	But once he draws you in with these inviting preludes,
612000	614000	he leads you to a pretty weird place.
614000	617000	His central political message is that leftist professors,
617000	620000	student activists, campus diversity initiatives,
620000	622000	and corporate HR departments
622000	626000	are collectively following the philosophy of postmodern neo-Marxism
626000	628000	to destroy Western civilization
628000	631000	and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare.
631000	635000	Now there's just no avoiding that this idea is actually pretty similar
635000	638000	to the cultural Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory,
638000	641000	but I'm just gonna ignore that because if I dwell on it,
641000	644000	I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist
644000	646000	and then everyone will think I'm crazy.
646000	649000	Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists.
649000	651000	I don't have anything to hide.
651000	653000	So let's just try not to think about that
653000	655000	and instead straightforwardly ask,
655000	659000	is it true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out to destroy us all?
659000	663000	Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?
663000	665000	We all know what Marxism is,
665000	668000	the idea that society should be understood as a class struggle
668000	670000	between workers and capitalists,
670000	672000	and that the workers will eventually revolt.
672000	674000	Some college professors definitely do believe that,
674000	676000	but 0% of corporate HR departments do,
676000	679000	so... that... okay.
679000	681000	So what is postmodernism?
681000	684000	Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.
684000	688000	Some people try to explain it by listing all the things that are called postmodern
688000	690000	trying to guess what they have in common.
690000	693000	That's basically what the YouTuber Armored Skeptic did in his video about it.
693000	695000	So many daddies in this video.
695000	697000	We should invite them all to a barbecue,
697000	700000	complain about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin.
700000	702000	I've had worse evenings.
702000	705000	I don't think there really is a common thread linking all the things called postmodern.
705000	708000	Basically postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945
708000	710000	that seemed new at the time.
710000	712000	But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism,
712000	715000	he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.
715000	717000	He's talking about postmodern philosophy.
717000	718000	So what's that?
718000	721000	Well... basically it's a kind of skepticism.
721000	723000	Not YouTube skepticism,
723000	725000	but actual skepticism.
725000	729000	You know, like having doubts about whether humans can really know things about the world.
729000	732000	Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea.
732000	734000	That goes way back to ancient times.
734000	739000	But more specifically, postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.
739000	740000	So what's modernism?
740000	741000	What's what?
741000	742000	What are words?
742000	743000	What's anything?
743000	746000	I'm gonna divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it.
746000	747000	First, there's early modernism.
747000	752000	Early modernism is the philosophy developed by a bunch of boring 18th century queens
752000	755000	which says that we can form universal theories about the world
755000	758000	through observation and reasoning, a.k.a. the scientific method.
758000	760000	Now that turns out to work pretty well
760000	763000	for whatever questions you have about plants and crystals
763000	766000	and how to medically reconfigure human genitals,
766000	768000	but it has some limits,
768000	770000	which was pointed out by David Hume,
770000	772000	one of the least boring 18th century queens
772000	776000	and one of the only philosophers I can actually put up with in small doses
776000	779000	even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish.
779000	780000	This is a call-out.
780000	783000	Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,
783000	788000	you can't really know much about important things like morality, causation, and the self
788000	791000	because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.
791000	793000	Anyway, then the late modernists came along and they said,
793000	796000	fuck Hume, we're gonna do science about those things anyway.
796000	800000	So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards
800000	804000	who one way or another tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.
804000	807000	So for example, you have psychoanalysis,
807000	811000	which said human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives,
811000	815000	which is of course ridiculous, I'm conscious of all my drives,
815000	818000	and you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat,
818000	821000	you got early sociology and anthropology,
821000	823000	which started out with racist social evolutionism
823000	827000	and progressed to a kind of we're-all-the-same universalism.
827000	829000	Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.
829000	831000	His first book, Maps of Meaning,
831000	834000	is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world
834000	838000	and create order out of chaos through universal myths and archetypes,
838000	842000	which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.
842000	844000	Boy, this is a lot of explaining.
844000	847000	It's so much explaining, it's triggering gender dysphoria.
847000	849000	I better put on some longer nails.
849000	852000	Nails? Is that all womanhood means to you?
855000	856000	Mm-hmm.
856000	858000	Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism,
858000	861000	so whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories
861000	864000	about reality, history, and humanity,
864000	868000	postmodernists say, actually, no, that's not possible.
868000	871000	For example, the French postmodernist Michel Foucault
871000	874000	Sargon? You little goose.
874000	877000	Michel Foucault wrote intellectual histories of subjects
877000	880000	like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,
880000	882000	in which he argued that we should not understand these histories
882000	886000	as straightforward progressions toward liberty and scientific truth,
886000	889000	but rather as mere shifts in the way that power
889000	892000	orders our institutions and populations.
892000	895000	The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.
895000	896000	Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.
896000	898000	If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.
898000	901000	Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,
901000	904000	irony being the skeptical caution with which we should regard
904000	907000	our own beliefs and our awareness that our vocabulary
907000	910000	for describing and understanding the world
910000	912000	is not the final or best vocabulary.
912000	915000	All right, that's enough explaining, and my nails are done.
915000	916000	Check it out.
916000	918000	Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails,
918000	921000	but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them
921000	923000	with barely concealed visceral rage?
923000	925000	Well, I have a solution for you.
925000	927000	The bisexual manicure.
927000	929000	One hand for the V, one hand for the D.
929000	931000	Both for degeneracy.
931000	933000	It's absolutely filthy.
933000	935000	So we've got all the pieces on the table.
935000	937000	Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.
937000	939000	On the one hand, we have Marxism,
939000	941000	a fundamentally modernist worldview
941000	944000	that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.
944000	946000	On the other hand, we have postmodernism,
946000	949000	a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity
949000	951000	to know any universal truth is about anything.
951000	954000	On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas
954000	955000	are not compatible.
955000	958000	And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,
958000	961000	with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre calling Foucault
961000	964000	the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.
964000	967000	And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died,
967000	969000	capitalism did end forever.
970000	976000	So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neomarxism?
976000	978000	Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists
978000	980000	were in some way influenced by Marxism,
980000	983000	so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.
983000	985000	But that's not what Peterson means.
985000	987000	It's clear from the way he uses the term
987000	989000	that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical
989000	991000	than it initially appears.
991000	993000	Peterson uses the term postmodern neomarxism
993000	995000	to include not only postmodern intellectuals
995000	997000	and Marxist intellectuals,
997000	1000000	but also liberal politicians, academic administrators,
1000000	1003000	and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,
1003000	1006000	and so-called identity politics activists,
1006000	1009000	including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.
1009000	1012000	Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.
1012000	1014000	Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism
1014000	1016000	are fundamentally at odds,
1016000	1018000	since Marxism is a big story about a struggle
1018000	1020000	between two clear and distinct groups,
1020000	1024000	and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,
1024000	1026000	and about the stability of binaries
1026000	1028000	like bourgeoisie and proletariat.
1028000	1030000	But that's not the only tension in Peterson's
1030000	1033000	clusterfuck idea of postmodern neomarxism.
1033000	1036000	Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows
1036000	1038000	that Marxists and identity politics activists
1038000	1040000	are constantly at each other's throats,
1040000	1042000	because the Marxists accuse the activists
1042000	1045000	of being bourgeois dogs who want more female CEOs of color
1045000	1048000	and more disabled transgender drone pilots,
1048000	1050000	while the activists accuse the Marxists
1050000	1052000	of being a boys' club of brocialists
1052000	1054000	no more woke on gender and race issues
1054000	1056000	than the average Jordan Peterson fan.
1056000	1058000	Most often, these accusations are correct,
1058000	1061000	because everyone is problematic, and I disown them all.
1061000	1063000	And then there's also the conflict
1063000	1065000	between the identity politics activists
1065000	1067000	and the postmodernists.
1067000	1070000	Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?
1070000	1072000	There's nothing postmodern about it.
1072000	1075000	Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice
1075000	1078000	for particular groups, such as women, people of color,
1078000	1080000	and gay and trans people.
1080000	1082000	This kind of activism presupposes
1082000	1084000	that these group categories exist
1084000	1087000	and are a useful basis for political organizing.
1087000	1089000	Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.
1089000	1091000	They want to show that these categories
1091000	1093000	race, gender, sexual orientation
1093000	1095000	are contingent social constructs
1095000	1098000	and are themselves potentially oppressive.
1098000	1100000	This is why conventional feminist activists
1100000	1102000	often hate postmodern feminism,
1102000	1104000	because the postmodern feminists want to show
1104000	1107000	that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance,
1107000	1109000	is contingent and potentially oppressive,
1109000	1111000	and they think we should be working
1111000	1113000	to destabilize and undermine it.
1113000	1115000	And then the conventional feminist activists say,
1115000	1117000	the fuck? We need the concept of womanhood
1117000	1119000	to organize around women's political interests.
1119000	1121000	How are we supposed to do that
1121000	1124000	if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?
1124000	1126000	And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,
1126000	1129000	well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler,
1129000	1131000	the most famous postmodern feminist ever.
1131000	1134000	Is it not a sign of despair over public politics
1134000	1136000	when identity becomes its own policy,
1136000	1139000	bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?
1139000	1142000	And this is not a call to return to silence or invisibility,
1142000	1144000	but rather to make use of a category
1144000	1146000	that can be called into question,
1146000	1149000	made to account for what it excludes.
1149000	1151000	If you take the first part of that quote out of context,
1151000	1154000	it almost sounds like something Jordan Peterson could have said.
1154000	1157000	The difference is that JP actually does think
1157000	1159000	we should return to silence and invisibility.
1159000	1160000	Or does he?
1160000	1162000	It's hard to tell what he thinks.
1162000	1163000	More on that in a moment.
1163000	1165000	I bring all of this up to show that 1.
1165000	1168000	The idea of postmodern neomarxist identity politics
1168000	1171000	as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical,
1171000	1173000	and 2.
1173000	1177000	Identity politics is not this dogma that must go unquestioned.
1177000	1179000	There are sophisticated debates about this
1179000	1181000	going on within leftist academia,
1181000	1184000	but JP either doesn't know that or doesn't care.
1184000	1187000	He uses the term postmodern neomarxism
1187000	1190000	to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force
1190000	1192000	bent on destroying western civilization,
1193000	1195000	when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons
1195000	1197000	who can't stop squabbling with each other
1197000	1199000	over every goddamn little issue.
1199000	1200000	The only reason I can think of
1200000	1203000	that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force
1203000	1205000	is if you're so far to the right
1205000	1207000	that literally everyone who supports
1207000	1210000	the economic and social advancement of disadvantaged groups
1210000	1212000	looks like one homogenous enemy.
1212000	1214000	But is that what JP is saying?
1214000	1216000	That he opposes all social progress
1216000	1219000	for women, racial, and sexual minorities?
1219000	1220000	Well, it's difficult to say,
1220000	1222000	because while he spends much of his time
1222000	1224000	comparing activists for these movements
1224000	1226000	to 20th century mass murderers,
1226000	1230000	he resists being pinned down to any more specific position.
1230000	1232000	I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier.
1232000	1234000	She came out of that interview looking bad,
1234000	1236000	but she had a tough job to do.
1236000	1238000	Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves
1238000	1241000	saying something that's more or less uncontroversially true,
1241000	1244000	while at the same time implying something controversial.
1244000	1247000	For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like
1247000	1250000	there are biological differences between men and women,
1250000	1251000	which is obviously true.
1251000	1254000	But he'll say it in the context of a conversation
1254000	1256000	about the underrepresentation of women in government,
1256000	1259000	which implies... what, exactly?
1259000	1261000	So how do you respond to this?
1261000	1263000	Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing
1263000	1265000	against the obviously true statement,
1265000	1267000	where you have to guess at what he's implying,
1267000	1271000	in response to which he can accuse you of misrepresenting him,
1271000	1274000	which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview.
1274000	1276000	The most famous moment where Peterson does this
1276000	1278000	is the notorious lobster argument.
1278000	1280000	So he starts by saying...
1280000	1283000	There's this idea that hierarchical structures
1283000	1287000	are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy.
1287000	1290000	And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies
1290000	1294000	and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,
1294000	1297000	so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.
1297000	1300000	You're saying that we should organize our societies
1300000	1302000	along the lines of the lobsters.
1302000	1305000	I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity
1305000	1308000	in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.
1308000	1312000	The problem with that is that no one has ever said
1312000	1316000	that every hierarchy is the product of Western patriarchy.
1316000	1318000	This is such a massive strawman
1318000	1321000	that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation of Peterson
1321000	1323000	suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview.
1323000	1327000	No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.
1327000	1331000	Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies,
1331000	1334000	limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.
1334000	1337000	No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.
1337000	1341000	The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender, race, and economics
1341000	1345000	within our own society, to which the lobster case is a complete non sequitur.
1345000	1349000	I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument the same way he uses it
1349000	1354000	to justify literally any hierarchy or authority, no matter how unjust.
1354000	1358000	You could be an 18th century Republican arguing against the monarchy,
1358000	1360000	and the monarch could turn around and say,
1360000	1364000	well, hierarchies are inevitable. God save the lobster queen.
1366000	1368000	Oh, dear God.
1368000	1372000	My lords, ladies, and those at length betwixt,
1372000	1376000	present rumors of Republican rumblings amongst the rabble
1376000	1379000	have compelled us to summon you together.
1379000	1383000	Let us remind you that nature hath so made the lobster
1383000	1387000	that some individuals be stronger than the others.
1387000	1393000	Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty
1393000	1395000	be anywise impugned.
1395000	1398000	And as for parliamentarians,
1398000	1402000	well, let them vote for cake.
1404000	1406000	Very good. Thank you.
1409000	1411000	I need new roommates.
1411000	1414000	So I've argued that Peterson is invoking the incoherent concept
1414000	1417000	of postmodern neo-Marxism as the supervillain
1417000	1420000	in a childishly simple worldview he's promoting
1420000	1423000	where these evil leftists are out to destroy the West.
1423000	1426000	Now, it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.
1426000	1428000	What, exactly, is the West?
1428000	1431000	Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West
1431000	1433000	that describes the intellectual tradition
1433000	1437000	that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.
1437000	1441000	Now, a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of the West
1441000	1445000	and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary and supremacist
1445000	1448000	and justifies imperialism and all that kind of thing.
1448000	1450000	But we don't have time for that right now,
1450000	1452000	so I'm just gonna grant that the West is a thing
1452000	1455000	and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.
1455000	1459000	For Peterson, the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism, individualism,
1459000	1462000	the idea that each human has a spark of divinity
1462000	1465000	and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,
1465000	1469000	a term more popular with conservative pundits than intellectual historians.
1470000	1474000	Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values with postmodern neo-Marxism,
1474000	1479000	which he describes as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.
1479000	1483000	This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms of geographical chauvinism
1483000	1486000	and external threat is inaccurate and scaremongering.
1486000	1491000	Marxism is Western philosophy. Postmodernism is Western philosophy.
1491000	1494000	If you're really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries
1494000	1498000	of the intellectual tradition, you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.
1498000	1504000	Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology that is meaningfully non-Western.
1504000	1509000	The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs
1509000	1513000	is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty
1513000	1515000	over collective dogma should be on board with.
1515000	1519000	You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy,
1519000	1523000	with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty.
1523000	1527000	I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson talk about the Western tradition,
1527000	1530000	but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.
1530000	1534000	If you did read it, you'd find a surprising diversity of thought
1534000	1537000	that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.
1537000	1542000	Much of Plato's political dialogues are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,
1542000	1546000	suggesting that, far from being an invention of postmodernity,
1546000	1550000	it was actually a pretty popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts.
1550000	1555000	Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David Hume famously said that reason is
1555000	1560000	and ought only to be the slave of the passions, literally feels over reels.
1560000	1566000	And meanwhile, his contemporary the Marquis de Sade was advocating the abolition of morality,
1566000	1568000	filling the churches with scat porn,
1568000	1573000	and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion so decadent and depraved
1573000	1576000	I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.
1576000	1579000	This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,
1579000	1584000	and it's just as much a part of the West as Peterson's soggy, Bible-padding conservatism.
1584000	1590000	But again, and I really can't stress this enough, I don't care either way.
1590000	1594000	I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.
1594000	1596000	So, what do you people want from me?
1596000	1599000	The Lobster Queen is dead. Long live the Queen.
1615000	1620000	Can't save the Lobster Queen.
1620000	1624000	Long live the Lobster Queen.
1624000	1628000	Can't save the Queen.
1632000	1638000	Stabbing through the skin with those crustaceans.
1638000	1642000	Can't save the Lobster Queen.
1642000	1649000	Stabbing through the skin with those crustaceans.
1669000	1670000	Where are those people?
1670000	1675000	There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in,
1675000	1679000	that I watch her, and I don't mean to misgender her because I think she identifies with her,
1679000	1682000	ContraPoints, I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber.
1682000	1685000	I've seen the name come up every now and again on Twitter.
1685000	1687000	Totally disagree with everything this person says,
1687000	1691000	but I look at it and I'm like, this seems very reasonable, educated, academic,
1691000	1696000	and I'm seeing reasons to hope that everyone's going to like her.
1696000	1698000	Hello, Dave.
