1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Antarctica is Earth's coolest continent, and most complicatedly claimed continent,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,000
yet sadly has no official flag to unite her.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Nayu might say, there's this!

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,240
And that flag is Antarctica-associated,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,520
but it's not official official, and comes with an ownership asterisk we must attend to.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,160
But first, Antarctica doesn't have an official flag because she's not an official country.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,400
Yes, humans have settled, depending on how much you want to stretch that word,

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,600
on the ice sheet with scientific outposts,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,400
but each is operated by a parent country, protecting their somewhat precarious claims.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,240
So, not really looking for a new banner to band everyone behind.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,720
Thus, there are no Antarctic citizens to officiate anything.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,400
But who cares? People everywheres want to fly flags, and come on!

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,600
The continent has cried out for one right from the first, in 1929,

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,320
when an early research vessel flew a white sheet as a flag of courtesy for passing through Antarctica's waters.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
Even though there were not-but-penguins to appreciate the gesture.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,440
It was done just for the fun of flying a flag with what the ship happened to have on hand.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,000
But since this rather literal representation of the snow-covered continent is not the most inspired design,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,280
it didn't catch on, and penguins only spotted it sporadically on subsequent ships.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,840
And it stayed that way until 1997 with a curious development,

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,400
as a company, Multimedia Corporation, was developing a video game, the 3D World Atlas.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,480
And yes, for nerdy 90s kids, a digital atlas totally counted as a game.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,880
Multico noticed Antarctica's flag absence, and deputized a designer to draw one,

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,040
who took a cue from the UN, which, on their flag, views the world from atop,

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,160
so Antarctica would be the same from a bottom, and borrowed the same colours as a nod to neutrality.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,440
So it was through this game that this design debuted to young flag fans everywhere,

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,640
including some who would grow up to end up on Antarctica, eh?

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
And it's a great flag, I'm not here to fud it.

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,520
But its origin does raise some questions of copyright.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Unlike the original white sheet, uncopyrightable, as it's nothing and old enough to be in the public domain anyway,

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,200
not so with the 97 design.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
And while its creator makes no claim to copyright, saying the flag is de facto public domain,

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,120
but what usually happens when a company commissions content is the company controls that content's copyright.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,320
So of course, on finding this out, one might think to email Multimedia Corporation about it.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:28,480
But they went bust, and now with no one to ask, it becomes a question of who could claim to claim the copyright.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
How hard could that be to find out?

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,560
And in this moment, standing at the threshold of a research question that could easily cost months of my life,

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,920
I swore to myself, this will be a short script.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Four serious this time, Grey.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,520
So I just let myself do a bit of basic binging.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
Eugh, that sounds very strange to say.

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,240
And tracked Multimedia Corporation and their unbingable, hmm, name through two potential lines of ownership.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,640
One through multiple corporate asset acquisitions and name changes that ended up in a multi-company

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,880
that seemingly has nothing to do with video games.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,840
And the other line led to EA, everyone's favorite developer dedicated to the Electronic Arts,

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,000
who was the original distributor of the Atlus.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,640
Under what terms, I didn't ask, because I did not wish to open their evil eye upon any of this.

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
And doubtless, neither of these companies have heard anything about the Atlus and its flag,

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,640
so let's all just promise to keep it that way, shall we?

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,160
Great.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,880
Now we can finally talk about what happened next.

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,680
See, in 2018, a new Antarctic flag, Public Domain, came on the scene.

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,240
It starts with the snow and ice white sheet from before,

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,360
but adds above the dark skies that dominate the continent for six months a year.

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,720
A mountain in the center uplifts, for unlike in the north, there's actual land under the ice,

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,040
and it casts a shadow to create the symbol of a compass pointing south,

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,520
which, as a bonus, makes this design mirror the northernmost flag on the northernmost continent,

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,400
just with flipped color placement for flipped pole placement.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
Very satisfying.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,640
And unique among flags, it creates a 3D effect that gives just a touch of techno-cool,

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,120
appropriate with how much tech was needed to conquer this coolest continent.

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,200
And it's totally not, but I'm just gonna call it that this 3D effect is also a nod to the 3D World Atlas,

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,080
connecting this flag to both of its forebears.

63
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,800
Perfect.

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,000
I could talk about flags all day, but I swore to keep it short, so...

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,280
I just wanted to let everyone know that when you spot this rare flag, it is of Antarctica,

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
so that for anyone watching this video there, when you see your flag fly high,

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,520
let you know that others know how awesome it is and have that brighten a day out of six months of dark.
