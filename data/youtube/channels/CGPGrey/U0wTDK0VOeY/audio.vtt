00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Antarctica is Earth's coolest continent, and most complicatedly claimed continent,

00:04.680 --> 00:08.000
yet sadly has no official flag to unite her.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.680
Nayu might say, there's this!

00:09.680 --> 00:12.240
And that flag is Antarctica-associated,

00:12.240 --> 00:17.520
but it's not official official, and comes with an ownership asterisk we must attend to.

00:17.520 --> 00:22.160
But first, Antarctica doesn't have an official flag because she's not an official country.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.400
Yes, humans have settled, depending on how much you want to stretch that word,

00:25.400 --> 00:27.600
on the ice sheet with scientific outposts,

00:27.600 --> 00:32.400
but each is operated by a parent country, protecting their somewhat precarious claims.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.240
So, not really looking for a new banner to band everyone behind.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.720
Thus, there are no Antarctic citizens to officiate anything.

00:40.720 --> 00:45.400
But who cares? People everywheres want to fly flags, and come on!

00:45.400 --> 00:49.600
The continent has cried out for one right from the first, in 1929,

00:49.600 --> 00:55.320
when an early research vessel flew a white sheet as a flag of courtesy for passing through Antarctica's waters.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.920
Even though there were not-but-penguins to appreciate the gesture.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.440
It was done just for the fun of flying a flag with what the ship happened to have on hand.

01:03.440 --> 01:10.000
But since this rather literal representation of the snow-covered continent is not the most inspired design,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.280
it didn't catch on, and penguins only spotted it sporadically on subsequent ships.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.840
And it stayed that way until 1997 with a curious development,

01:17.840 --> 01:23.400
as a company, Multimedia Corporation, was developing a video game, the 3D World Atlas.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.480
And yes, for nerdy 90s kids, a digital atlas totally counted as a game.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.880
Multico noticed Antarctica's flag absence, and deputized a designer to draw one,

01:31.880 --> 01:36.040
who took a cue from the UN, which, on their flag, views the world from atop,

01:36.040 --> 01:41.160
so Antarctica would be the same from a bottom, and borrowed the same colours as a nod to neutrality.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.440
So it was through this game that this design debuted to young flag fans everywhere,

01:45.440 --> 01:48.640
including some who would grow up to end up on Antarctica, eh?

01:48.640 --> 01:51.360
And it's a great flag, I'm not here to fud it.

01:51.360 --> 01:56.520
But its origin does raise some questions of copyright.

01:56.520 --> 02:02.520
Unlike the original white sheet, uncopyrightable, as it's nothing and old enough to be in the public domain anyway,

02:02.520 --> 02:05.200
not so with the 97 design.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.920
And while its creator makes no claim to copyright, saying the flag is de facto public domain,

02:09.920 --> 02:16.120
but what usually happens when a company commissions content is the company controls that content's copyright.

02:16.120 --> 02:21.320
So of course, on finding this out, one might think to email Multimedia Corporation about it.

02:21.320 --> 02:28.480
But they went bust, and now with no one to ask, it becomes a question of who could claim to claim the copyright.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.360
How hard could that be to find out?

02:31.360 --> 02:37.560
And in this moment, standing at the threshold of a research question that could easily cost months of my life,

02:37.560 --> 02:41.920
I swore to myself, this will be a short script.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.360
Four serious this time, Grey.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.520
So I just let myself do a bit of basic binging.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.200
Eugh, that sounds very strange to say.

02:49.200 --> 02:55.240
And tracked Multimedia Corporation and their unbingable, hmm, name through two potential lines of ownership.

02:55.240 --> 03:00.640
One through multiple corporate asset acquisitions and name changes that ended up in a multi-company

03:00.640 --> 03:02.880
that seemingly has nothing to do with video games.

03:02.880 --> 03:10.840
And the other line led to EA, everyone's favorite developer dedicated to the Electronic Arts,

03:10.840 --> 03:14.000
who was the original distributor of the Atlus.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.640
Under what terms, I didn't ask, because I did not wish to open their evil eye upon any of this.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.920
And doubtless, neither of these companies have heard anything about the Atlus and its flag,

03:25.920 --> 03:29.640
so let's all just promise to keep it that way, shall we?

03:29.640 --> 03:30.160
Great.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.880
Now we can finally talk about what happened next.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.680
See, in 2018, a new Antarctic flag, Public Domain, came on the scene.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.240
It starts with the snow and ice white sheet from before,

03:40.240 --> 03:44.360
but adds above the dark skies that dominate the continent for six months a year.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.720
A mountain in the center uplifts, for unlike in the north, there's actual land under the ice,

03:48.720 --> 03:53.040
and it casts a shadow to create the symbol of a compass pointing south,

03:53.040 --> 03:57.520
which, as a bonus, makes this design mirror the northernmost flag on the northernmost continent,

03:57.520 --> 04:00.400
just with flipped color placement for flipped pole placement.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.520
Very satisfying.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.640
And unique among flags, it creates a 3D effect that gives just a touch of techno-cool,

04:06.640 --> 04:11.120
appropriate with how much tech was needed to conquer this coolest continent.

04:11.120 --> 04:17.200
And it's totally not, but I'm just gonna call it that this 3D effect is also a nod to the 3D World Atlas,

04:17.200 --> 04:20.080
connecting this flag to both of its forebears.

04:20.080 --> 04:20.800
Perfect.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.000
I could talk about flags all day, but I swore to keep it short, so...

04:24.000 --> 04:29.280
I just wanted to let everyone know that when you spot this rare flag, it is of Antarctica,

04:29.280 --> 04:33.680
so that for anyone watching this video there, when you see your flag fly high,

04:33.680 --> 04:39.520
let you know that others know how awesome it is and have that brighten a day out of six months of dark.
