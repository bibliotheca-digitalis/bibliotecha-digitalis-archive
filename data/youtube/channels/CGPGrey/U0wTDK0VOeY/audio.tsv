0	4680	Antarctica is Earth's coolest continent, and most complicatedly claimed continent,
4680	8000	yet sadly has no official flag to unite her.
8000	9680	Nayu might say, there's this!
9680	12240	And that flag is Antarctica-associated,
12240	17520	but it's not official official, and comes with an ownership asterisk we must attend to.
17520	22160	But first, Antarctica doesn't have an official flag because she's not an official country.
22160	25400	Yes, humans have settled, depending on how much you want to stretch that word,
25400	27600	on the ice sheet with scientific outposts,
27600	32400	but each is operated by a parent country, protecting their somewhat precarious claims.
32400	37240	So, not really looking for a new banner to band everyone behind.
37240	40720	Thus, there are no Antarctic citizens to officiate anything.
40720	45400	But who cares? People everywheres want to fly flags, and come on!
45400	49600	The continent has cried out for one right from the first, in 1929,
49600	55320	when an early research vessel flew a white sheet as a flag of courtesy for passing through Antarctica's waters.
55320	58920	Even though there were not-but-penguins to appreciate the gesture.
58920	63440	It was done just for the fun of flying a flag with what the ship happened to have on hand.
63440	70000	But since this rather literal representation of the snow-covered continent is not the most inspired design,
70000	74280	it didn't catch on, and penguins only spotted it sporadically on subsequent ships.
74280	77840	And it stayed that way until 1997 with a curious development,
77840	83400	as a company, Multimedia Corporation, was developing a video game, the 3D World Atlas.
83400	87480	And yes, for nerdy 90s kids, a digital atlas totally counted as a game.
87480	91880	Multico noticed Antarctica's flag absence, and deputized a designer to draw one,
91880	96040	who took a cue from the UN, which, on their flag, views the world from atop,
96040	101160	so Antarctica would be the same from a bottom, and borrowed the same colours as a nod to neutrality.
101160	105440	So it was through this game that this design debuted to young flag fans everywhere,
105440	108640	including some who would grow up to end up on Antarctica, eh?
108640	111360	And it's a great flag, I'm not here to fud it.
111360	116520	But its origin does raise some questions of copyright.
116520	122520	Unlike the original white sheet, uncopyrightable, as it's nothing and old enough to be in the public domain anyway,
122520	125200	not so with the 97 design.
125200	129920	And while its creator makes no claim to copyright, saying the flag is de facto public domain,
129920	136120	but what usually happens when a company commissions content is the company controls that content's copyright.
136120	141320	So of course, on finding this out, one might think to email Multimedia Corporation about it.
141320	148480	But they went bust, and now with no one to ask, it becomes a question of who could claim to claim the copyright.
148480	151360	How hard could that be to find out?
151360	157560	And in this moment, standing at the threshold of a research question that could easily cost months of my life,
157560	161920	I swore to myself, this will be a short script.
161920	164360	Four serious this time, Grey.
164360	167520	So I just let myself do a bit of basic binging.
167520	169200	Eugh, that sounds very strange to say.
169200	175240	And tracked Multimedia Corporation and their unbingable, hmm, name through two potential lines of ownership.
175240	180640	One through multiple corporate asset acquisitions and name changes that ended up in a multi-company
180640	182880	that seemingly has nothing to do with video games.
182880	190840	And the other line led to EA, everyone's favorite developer dedicated to the Electronic Arts,
190840	194000	who was the original distributor of the Atlus.
194000	200640	Under what terms, I didn't ask, because I did not wish to open their evil eye upon any of this.
200640	205920	And doubtless, neither of these companies have heard anything about the Atlus and its flag,
205920	209640	so let's all just promise to keep it that way, shall we?
209640	210160	Great.
210160	212880	Now we can finally talk about what happened next.
212880	217680	See, in 2018, a new Antarctic flag, Public Domain, came on the scene.
217680	220240	It starts with the snow and ice white sheet from before,
220240	224360	but adds above the dark skies that dominate the continent for six months a year.
224360	228720	A mountain in the center uplifts, for unlike in the north, there's actual land under the ice,
228720	233040	and it casts a shadow to create the symbol of a compass pointing south,
233040	237520	which, as a bonus, makes this design mirror the northernmost flag on the northernmost continent,
237520	240400	just with flipped color placement for flipped pole placement.
240400	241520	Very satisfying.
241520	246640	And unique among flags, it creates a 3D effect that gives just a touch of techno-cool,
246640	251120	appropriate with how much tech was needed to conquer this coolest continent.
251120	257200	And it's totally not, but I'm just gonna call it that this 3D effect is also a nod to the 3D World Atlas,
257200	260080	connecting this flag to both of its forebears.
260080	260800	Perfect.
260800	264000	I could talk about flags all day, but I swore to keep it short, so...
264000	269280	I just wanted to let everyone know that when you spot this rare flag, it is of Antarctica,
269280	273680	so that for anyone watching this video there, when you see your flag fly high,
273680	279520	let you know that others know how awesome it is and have that brighten a day out of six months of dark.
