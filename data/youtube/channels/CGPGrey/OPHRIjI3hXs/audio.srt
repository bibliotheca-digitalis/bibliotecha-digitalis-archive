1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Vatican City, capital of the Catholic Church, home to the Pope, owner of impressive collections

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,000
of art and history all contained within the borders of the world's smallest country, conveniently

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,200
circumnavigatable on foot in only 40 minutes.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,960
Just how did the world end up with this tiny nation?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,040
The short answer is because Mussolini and the long answer is fiendishly complicated

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,160
so here's a simplified medium version.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,640
The Popes used to rule a country called the Papal States that covered much of modern day

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Italy.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,100
It was during this thousand plus year reign that the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica,

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,180
the largest church in the world and also built a wall around the base of a hill known

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,840
as Vatican upon which St. Peter's stood.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,300
But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought Rome would make an awesome capital for their

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,800
country and so conquered the Papal States.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,800
His nation destroyed, the Pope hid behind the walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,920
to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed while simultaneously complaining about being

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,820
a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy which, according to him, didn't exist.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,940
Rather than risk religious civil war by getting rid of the Pope, the Kingdom of Italy decided

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,860
to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give up.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,300
But religion is nothing if not obstinate and one, two, three, four, five Popes and sixty

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,440
years later nothing had changed.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,500
Which now brings us to Benito Mussolini, the then Prime Minister of Italy who was tired

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,460
of listening to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics about his self-imposed imprisonment

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,500
so Mussolini thought he could score some political points by striking a deal which looked like

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
this.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,320
One, Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope and two, Italy gave the Pope a bunch

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,480
of apology money.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,800
In return the Pope acknowledged that Italy existed and two, the Pope promised to remain

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,400
neutral in politics and wars on the off chance that, you know, Mussolini thought this might

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
be a thing.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,160
The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican City, was born.

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,820
And today the tiny nation on a hill has all the things you'd expect of a country, its

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,760
own government that makes its own laws that are enforced by its own police who put people

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,600
who break them in its own jail.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
It also has its own bank and prints its own stamps and issues its own license plates though

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,160
only its citizens can drive within its borders presumably because of the terrible terrible

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,320
parking and as the true mark of any self-respecting nation it has its own top level domain, .va.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,760
But despite all these national trappings, Vatican City is really not like any other

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
country.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,180
Hold on to your fancy hat because it's about to get weird.

40
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,060
To understand the Vatican there are two people and two things you need to know about.

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,600
The famous Pope, the incredibly confusing Holy See, the country of Vatican City and

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,400
along with that the almost completely unknown King of Vatican City.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,480
But first the Pope who gets a throne to sit upon and from which he acts as the bishop

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,520
for all the Catholics in Rome.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
Actually all bishops in the Catholic Church get their own thrones but because the Bishop

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,000
of Rome is also the Pope his throne is special and has its own special name, the Holy See.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,880
Every time a Pope dies or retires there is a sort of game of thrones to see which of

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,560
the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy See.

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,820
So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal and as such the name the Holy See not only

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,300
refers to the throne but also all the rules that make the Catholic Church the Catholic

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Church.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,980
When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned deal technically he gave the land of Vatican

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,860
City to the Holy See which believe it or not is a legal corporate person in international

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
law.

55
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,380
Basically every time you hear the words the Holy See think Catholic Church Incorporated

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,500
of which the Pope is the CEO.

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Now back to the King.

58
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,180
The King of Vatican City has absolute unchecked power within the country's borders and his

59
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,460
presence makes Vatican City one of only six remaining absolute monarchies in the world

60
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,980
including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland.

61
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,660
The King's absolute power is why Vatican City can't join the European Union because only

62
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,220
democracies are allowed.

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,780
Though Vatican City does, strictly speaking, have a legislative branch of government staffed

64
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,040
by Cardinals appointed by the Pope, the King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,100
at any time for any reason.

66
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,020
So why do you never hear about the King of Vatican City?

67
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,900
Because though King and Pope are two different roles they just happen to be occupied by the

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,740
same person at the same time.

69
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,580
Which has the funny consequence that, because the Pope is elected and the King is all powerful

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,580
but they're the same guy, it makes Vatican City the world's only elected, non-hereditary

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,900
absolute monarchy.

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,060
It's this dual role that makes untangling Vatican City so difficult because the Pope,

73
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,260
depending on the situation, acts either as the King of the country of Vatican City or

74
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,180
the Pope of the Holy See.

75
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Got it?

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
No?

77
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Okay here's an analogy.

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,420
A global international company, say Gray Industries, had a CEO who convinced the United States

79
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,740
to give one of its islands to the company which then made the island into a new country,

80
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,860
Graytropolis, with an absolute monarchy as its government and the law that the King of

81
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,820
Graytropolis is by definition the CEO of Gray Industries.

82
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,060
It's pretty obvious at this point that the CEO should move his corporate headquarters

83
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,540
to the new nation so that the laws of the country can benefit the company and the company's

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,860
global reach can benefit the country.

85
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,580
As for the man in the middle, sometimes it's good to be the CEO and sometimes it's good

86
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,900
to be the King.

87
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,860
That is essentially Vatican City.

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,500
But if you're still confused, don't worry, even other countries can't keep it straight.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,160
For example, the United Nations has the Holy See, the corporation as a member, but not

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,540
Vatican City, the actual country.

91
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,540
And the Holy See gives passports to Vatican City citizens that other countries accept

92
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,140
even though those passports come from a company, not a country.

93
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,820
And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they are perhaps the strangest consequence of the

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,700
Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch.

95
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,220
While other countries mint new citizens with the ever popular process of human reproduction,

96
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,620
Vatican City does not.

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,820
No one in Vatican City is born a citizen and that's not just because within a rounding

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,220
error there are no female Vatican's.

99
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,540
The only way to become a citizen is for the King of Vatican City to appoint you as one

100
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,760
and the King only appoints you a citizen if you work for the Pope who is also the King.

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,820
And because the King is all powerful, your citizenship is at his whim.

102
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,520
If you quit your job for the Pope, the King, who is also the Pope, will revoke your citizenship.

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,140
These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't have a real permanent population to speak

104
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
of.

105
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,120
There are about 500 full citizens which is fewer people than live in single skyscrapers

106
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
in many countries.

107
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,700
And all these citizens work for the Holy See as either cardinals or diplomats or the Pope's

108
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,460
bodyguards or other Catholic related jobs.

109
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,720
So it's best to think of Vatican City as a kind of sovereign corporate headquarters that

110
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,140
grants temporary citizenship to its managers rather than as a real city-state like Singapore

111
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,380
which has a self-reproducing population of citizens engaged in a variety of economic

112
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,340
activities, both of which Vatican City lacks.

113
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,140
But in the end, the reason the world cares about Vatican City is not because of the citizens

114
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,500
within its walls but because of the billion members of its church outside of those walls.

115
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,220
you
