0	4520	Vatican City, capital of the Catholic Church, home to the Pope, owner of impressive collections
4520	9000	of art and history all contained within the borders of the world's smallest country, conveniently
9000	12200	circumnavigatable on foot in only 40 minutes.
12200	14960	Just how did the world end up with this tiny nation?
14960	19040	The short answer is because Mussolini and the long answer is fiendishly complicated
19040	21160	so here's a simplified medium version.
21160	24640	The Popes used to rule a country called the Papal States that covered much of modern day
24640	25640	Italy.
25640	29100	It was during this thousand plus year reign that the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica,
29100	33180	the largest church in the world and also built a wall around the base of a hill known
33180	35840	as Vatican upon which St. Peter's stood.
35840	39300	But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought Rome would make an awesome capital for their
39300	41800	country and so conquered the Papal States.
41800	45800	His nation destroyed, the Pope hid behind the walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused
45800	49920	to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed while simultaneously complaining about being
49920	53820	a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy which, according to him, didn't exist.
53820	57940	Rather than risk religious civil war by getting rid of the Pope, the Kingdom of Italy decided
57940	60860	to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give up.
60860	65300	But religion is nothing if not obstinate and one, two, three, four, five Popes and sixty
65300	67440	years later nothing had changed.
67440	71500	Which now brings us to Benito Mussolini, the then Prime Minister of Italy who was tired
71500	75460	of listening to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics about his self-imposed imprisonment
75460	79500	so Mussolini thought he could score some political points by striking a deal which looked like
79500	80500	this.
80500	84320	One, Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope and two, Italy gave the Pope a bunch
84320	85480	of apology money.
85480	89800	In return the Pope acknowledged that Italy existed and two, the Pope promised to remain
89800	94400	neutral in politics and wars on the off chance that, you know, Mussolini thought this might
94400	95400	be a thing.
95400	98160	The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican City, was born.
98160	101820	And today the tiny nation on a hill has all the things you'd expect of a country, its
101820	105760	own government that makes its own laws that are enforced by its own police who put people
105760	107600	who break them in its own jail.
107600	111360	It also has its own bank and prints its own stamps and issues its own license plates though
111360	115160	only its citizens can drive within its borders presumably because of the terrible terrible
115160	121320	parking and as the true mark of any self-respecting nation it has its own top level domain, .va.
121320	125760	But despite all these national trappings, Vatican City is really not like any other
125760	126760	country.
126760	129180	Hold on to your fancy hat because it's about to get weird.
129180	133060	To understand the Vatican there are two people and two things you need to know about.
133060	137600	The famous Pope, the incredibly confusing Holy See, the country of Vatican City and
137600	141400	along with that the almost completely unknown King of Vatican City.
141400	145480	But first the Pope who gets a throne to sit upon and from which he acts as the bishop
145480	147520	for all the Catholics in Rome.
147520	151120	Actually all bishops in the Catholic Church get their own thrones but because the Bishop
151120	157000	of Rome is also the Pope his throne is special and has its own special name, the Holy See.
157000	160880	Every time a Pope dies or retires there is a sort of game of thrones to see which of
160880	163560	the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy See.
163560	168820	So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal and as such the name the Holy See not only
168820	173300	refers to the throne but also all the rules that make the Catholic Church the Catholic
173300	174300	Church.
174300	177980	When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned deal technically he gave the land of Vatican
177980	182860	City to the Holy See which believe it or not is a legal corporate person in international
182860	183860	law.
183860	187380	Basically every time you hear the words the Holy See think Catholic Church Incorporated
187380	189500	of which the Pope is the CEO.
189500	190700	Now back to the King.
190700	195180	The King of Vatican City has absolute unchecked power within the country's borders and his
195180	199460	presence makes Vatican City one of only six remaining absolute monarchies in the world
199460	202980	including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland.
202980	207660	The King's absolute power is why Vatican City can't join the European Union because only
207660	209220	democracies are allowed.
209220	212780	Though Vatican City does, strictly speaking, have a legislative branch of government staffed
212780	217040	by Cardinals appointed by the Pope, the King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions
217040	219100	at any time for any reason.
219100	222020	So why do you never hear about the King of Vatican City?
222020	225900	Because though King and Pope are two different roles they just happen to be occupied by the
225900	227740	same person at the same time.
227740	231580	Which has the funny consequence that, because the Pope is elected and the King is all powerful
231580	236580	but they're the same guy, it makes Vatican City the world's only elected, non-hereditary
236580	237900	absolute monarchy.
237900	242060	It's this dual role that makes untangling Vatican City so difficult because the Pope,
242060	246260	depending on the situation, acts either as the King of the country of Vatican City or
246260	248180	the Pope of the Holy See.
248180	249180	Got it?
249180	250180	No?
250180	251180	Okay here's an analogy.
251340	255420	A global international company, say Gray Industries, had a CEO who convinced the United States
255420	259740	to give one of its islands to the company which then made the island into a new country,
259740	263860	Graytropolis, with an absolute monarchy as its government and the law that the King of
263860	267820	Graytropolis is by definition the CEO of Gray Industries.
267820	271060	It's pretty obvious at this point that the CEO should move his corporate headquarters
271060	275540	to the new nation so that the laws of the country can benefit the company and the company's
275540	277860	global reach can benefit the country.
277860	281580	As for the man in the middle, sometimes it's good to be the CEO and sometimes it's good
281580	282900	to be the King.
282900	284860	That is essentially Vatican City.
284860	288500	But if you're still confused, don't worry, even other countries can't keep it straight.
288500	293160	For example, the United Nations has the Holy See, the corporation as a member, but not
293160	295540	Vatican City, the actual country.
295540	299540	And the Holy See gives passports to Vatican City citizens that other countries accept
299540	303140	even though those passports come from a company, not a country.
303140	307820	And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they are perhaps the strangest consequence of the
307820	310700	Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch.
310700	315220	While other countries mint new citizens with the ever popular process of human reproduction,
315220	316620	Vatican City does not.
316620	320820	No one in Vatican City is born a citizen and that's not just because within a rounding
320820	323220	error there are no female Vatican's.
323220	327540	The only way to become a citizen is for the King of Vatican City to appoint you as one
327540	332760	and the King only appoints you a citizen if you work for the Pope who is also the King.
332760	336820	And because the King is all powerful, your citizenship is at his whim.
336820	341520	If you quit your job for the Pope, the King, who is also the Pope, will revoke your citizenship.
341520	345140	These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't have a real permanent population to speak
345140	346140	of.
346140	350120	There are about 500 full citizens which is fewer people than live in single skyscrapers
350120	351240	in many countries.
351240	355700	And all these citizens work for the Holy See as either cardinals or diplomats or the Pope's
355700	358460	bodyguards or other Catholic related jobs.
358460	361720	So it's best to think of Vatican City as a kind of sovereign corporate headquarters that
361720	366140	grants temporary citizenship to its managers rather than as a real city-state like Singapore
366140	370380	which has a self-reproducing population of citizens engaged in a variety of economic
370380	373340	activities, both of which Vatican City lacks.
373340	377140	But in the end, the reason the world cares about Vatican City is not because of the citizens
377140	381500	within its walls but because of the billion members of its church outside of those walls.
