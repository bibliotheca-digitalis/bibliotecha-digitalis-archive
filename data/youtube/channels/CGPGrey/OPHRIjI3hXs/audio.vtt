00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Vatican City, capital of the Catholic Church, home to the Pope, owner of impressive collections

00:04.520 --> 00:09.000
of art and history all contained within the borders of the world's smallest country, conveniently

00:09.000 --> 00:12.200
circumnavigatable on foot in only 40 minutes.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.960
Just how did the world end up with this tiny nation?

00:14.960 --> 00:19.040
The short answer is because Mussolini and the long answer is fiendishly complicated

00:19.040 --> 00:21.160
so here's a simplified medium version.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.640
The Popes used to rule a country called the Papal States that covered much of modern day

00:24.640 --> 00:25.640
Italy.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.100
It was during this thousand plus year reign that the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica,

00:29.100 --> 00:33.180
the largest church in the world and also built a wall around the base of a hill known

00:33.180 --> 00:35.840
as Vatican upon which St. Peter's stood.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.300
But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought Rome would make an awesome capital for their

00:39.300 --> 00:41.800
country and so conquered the Papal States.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.800
His nation destroyed, the Pope hid behind the walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused

00:45.800 --> 00:49.920
to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed while simultaneously complaining about being

00:49.920 --> 00:53.820
a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy which, according to him, didn't exist.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.940
Rather than risk religious civil war by getting rid of the Pope, the Kingdom of Italy decided

00:57.940 --> 01:00.860
to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give up.

01:00.860 --> 01:05.300
But religion is nothing if not obstinate and one, two, three, four, five Popes and sixty

01:05.300 --> 01:07.440
years later nothing had changed.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.500
Which now brings us to Benito Mussolini, the then Prime Minister of Italy who was tired

01:11.500 --> 01:15.460
of listening to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics about his self-imposed imprisonment

01:15.460 --> 01:19.500
so Mussolini thought he could score some political points by striking a deal which looked like

01:19.500 --> 01:20.500
this.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.320
One, Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope and two, Italy gave the Pope a bunch

01:24.320 --> 01:25.480
of apology money.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.800
In return the Pope acknowledged that Italy existed and two, the Pope promised to remain

01:29.800 --> 01:34.400
neutral in politics and wars on the off chance that, you know, Mussolini thought this might

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
be a thing.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.160
The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican City, was born.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.820
And today the tiny nation on a hill has all the things you'd expect of a country, its

01:41.820 --> 01:45.760
own government that makes its own laws that are enforced by its own police who put people

01:45.760 --> 01:47.600
who break them in its own jail.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.360
It also has its own bank and prints its own stamps and issues its own license plates though

01:51.360 --> 01:55.160
only its citizens can drive within its borders presumably because of the terrible terrible

01:55.160 --> 02:01.320
parking and as the true mark of any self-respecting nation it has its own top level domain, .va.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.760
But despite all these national trappings, Vatican City is really not like any other

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
country.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.180
Hold on to your fancy hat because it's about to get weird.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.060
To understand the Vatican there are two people and two things you need to know about.

02:13.060 --> 02:17.600
The famous Pope, the incredibly confusing Holy See, the country of Vatican City and

02:17.600 --> 02:21.400
along with that the almost completely unknown King of Vatican City.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.480
But first the Pope who gets a throne to sit upon and from which he acts as the bishop

02:25.480 --> 02:27.520
for all the Catholics in Rome.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.120
Actually all bishops in the Catholic Church get their own thrones but because the Bishop

02:31.120 --> 02:37.000
of Rome is also the Pope his throne is special and has its own special name, the Holy See.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.880
Every time a Pope dies or retires there is a sort of game of thrones to see which of

02:40.880 --> 02:43.560
the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy See.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.820
So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal and as such the name the Holy See not only

02:48.820 --> 02:53.300
refers to the throne but also all the rules that make the Catholic Church the Catholic

02:53.300 --> 02:54.300
Church.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.980
When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned deal technically he gave the land of Vatican

02:57.980 --> 03:02.860
City to the Holy See which believe it or not is a legal corporate person in international

03:02.860 --> 03:03.860
law.

03:03.860 --> 03:07.380
Basically every time you hear the words the Holy See think Catholic Church Incorporated

03:07.380 --> 03:09.500
of which the Pope is the CEO.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.700
Now back to the King.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.180
The King of Vatican City has absolute unchecked power within the country's borders and his

03:15.180 --> 03:19.460
presence makes Vatican City one of only six remaining absolute monarchies in the world

03:19.460 --> 03:22.980
including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland.

03:22.980 --> 03:27.660
The King's absolute power is why Vatican City can't join the European Union because only

03:27.660 --> 03:29.220
democracies are allowed.

03:29.220 --> 03:32.780
Though Vatican City does, strictly speaking, have a legislative branch of government staffed

03:32.780 --> 03:37.040
by Cardinals appointed by the Pope, the King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions

03:37.040 --> 03:39.100
at any time for any reason.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.020
So why do you never hear about the King of Vatican City?

03:42.020 --> 03:45.900
Because though King and Pope are two different roles they just happen to be occupied by the

03:45.900 --> 03:47.740
same person at the same time.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.580
Which has the funny consequence that, because the Pope is elected and the King is all powerful

03:51.580 --> 03:56.580
but they're the same guy, it makes Vatican City the world's only elected, non-hereditary

03:56.580 --> 03:57.900
absolute monarchy.

03:57.900 --> 04:02.060
It's this dual role that makes untangling Vatican City so difficult because the Pope,

04:02.060 --> 04:06.260
depending on the situation, acts either as the King of the country of Vatican City or

04:06.260 --> 04:08.180
the Pope of the Holy See.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.180
Got it?

04:09.180 --> 04:10.180
No?

04:10.180 --> 04:11.180
Okay here's an analogy.

04:11.340 --> 04:15.420
A global international company, say Gray Industries, had a CEO who convinced the United States

04:15.420 --> 04:19.740
to give one of its islands to the company which then made the island into a new country,

04:19.740 --> 04:23.860
Graytropolis, with an absolute monarchy as its government and the law that the King of

04:23.860 --> 04:27.820
Graytropolis is by definition the CEO of Gray Industries.

04:27.820 --> 04:31.060
It's pretty obvious at this point that the CEO should move his corporate headquarters

04:31.060 --> 04:35.540
to the new nation so that the laws of the country can benefit the company and the company's

04:35.540 --> 04:37.860
global reach can benefit the country.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.580
As for the man in the middle, sometimes it's good to be the CEO and sometimes it's good

04:41.580 --> 04:42.900
to be the King.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.860
That is essentially Vatican City.

04:44.860 --> 04:48.500
But if you're still confused, don't worry, even other countries can't keep it straight.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.160
For example, the United Nations has the Holy See, the corporation as a member, but not

04:53.160 --> 04:55.540
Vatican City, the actual country.

04:55.540 --> 04:59.540
And the Holy See gives passports to Vatican City citizens that other countries accept

04:59.540 --> 05:03.140
even though those passports come from a company, not a country.

05:03.140 --> 05:07.820
And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they are perhaps the strangest consequence of the

05:07.820 --> 05:10.700
Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch.

05:10.700 --> 05:15.220
While other countries mint new citizens with the ever popular process of human reproduction,

05:15.220 --> 05:16.620
Vatican City does not.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.820
No one in Vatican City is born a citizen and that's not just because within a rounding

05:20.820 --> 05:23.220
error there are no female Vatican's.

05:23.220 --> 05:27.540
The only way to become a citizen is for the King of Vatican City to appoint you as one

05:27.540 --> 05:32.760
and the King only appoints you a citizen if you work for the Pope who is also the King.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.820
And because the King is all powerful, your citizenship is at his whim.

05:36.820 --> 05:41.520
If you quit your job for the Pope, the King, who is also the Pope, will revoke your citizenship.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.140
These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't have a real permanent population to speak

05:45.140 --> 05:46.140
of.

05:46.140 --> 05:50.120
There are about 500 full citizens which is fewer people than live in single skyscrapers

05:50.120 --> 05:51.240
in many countries.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.700
And all these citizens work for the Holy See as either cardinals or diplomats or the Pope's

05:55.700 --> 05:58.460
bodyguards or other Catholic related jobs.

05:58.460 --> 06:01.720
So it's best to think of Vatican City as a kind of sovereign corporate headquarters that

06:01.720 --> 06:06.140
grants temporary citizenship to its managers rather than as a real city-state like Singapore

06:06.140 --> 06:10.380
which has a self-reproducing population of citizens engaged in a variety of economic

06:10.380 --> 06:13.340
activities, both of which Vatican City lacks.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.140
But in the end, the reason the world cares about Vatican City is not because of the citizens

06:17.140 --> 06:21.500
within its walls but because of the billion members of its church outside of those walls.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.220
