1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Between the first Europeans arriving in 1492 and the Victorian age,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,600
the indigenous population of the New World dropped by at least 90%.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,100
The cause? Not the conquistadors and company.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:22,000
They killed lots of people, but their death count is nothing compared to what they brought with them.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Smallpox, typhus, tuberculosis, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, mumps, measles, and more

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,800
leapt from those first explorers to the coastal tribes,

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,800
then onward the microscopic invaders spread through a hemisphere of people with no defenses against them.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,300
Tens of millions died.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,300
These germs decided the fate of these battles long before the fighting started.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,800
Now ask yourself, why didn't the Europeans get sick?

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,800
If New Worlders were vulnerable to Old World diseases, then surely Old Worlders would be vulnerable to New World diseases.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Yet there was no America pox spreading eastward, infecting Europe, and cutting the population from 90 million to 9.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Had America pox existed, it would have rather dampened European ability for transatlantic expansion.

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,800
To answer why this didn't happen, we need first to distinguish regular diseases like the common cold from what we'll call plagues.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
First, plagues spread quickly between people.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Sneezes spread plagues faster than handshakes which are faster than closeness.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Plagues use more of this than this.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Secondly and importantly, they kill you quickly or you become immune.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Catch a plague and you're dead within 7 to 30 days.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Survive and you'll never get it again.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Your body has learned to fight it.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,800
You might still carry it, the plague lives in you, you can spread it, but it can't hurt you.

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,800
The surface answer to this question isn't that Europeans had better immune systems to fight off New World plagues.

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,800
It's that the New World didn't have plagues for them to catch.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,800
They had regular diseases, but there was no America pox to carry.

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,800
These are history's biggest killers and they all come from the old world.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
But why?

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Let's dig deeper and talk cholera.

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,800
A plague that spreads if your civilization does a bad job of separating drinking water from pooping water.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,800
London was terrible at this, making it the cholera capital of the world.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Cholera can rip through dense neighborhoods killing swaths of the population before moving onward.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
But that's the key. It has to move on.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
In a small, isolated group, a plague-like cholera cannot survive.

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,800
It kills all available victims, leaving only the immune and then there's nowhere to go.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
It's a fire that burns through its fuel.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,800
But a city, shining city on the hill, to which rural migrants flock, where hundreds of babies are born a day,

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
this is sanctuary for the fire of plague.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Fresh kindling comes to it.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,800
The plague flares and smolders and flares and smolders again, impossible to extinguish.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Historically, in city borders, plagues killed faster than people could breed.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Cities grew because more people moved to them than died inside of them.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Cities only started growing from their own population in the 1900s,

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,800
when medicine finally left its leeches and bloodletting phase and entered its soap and soup phase,

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,800
giving humans some tools to slow death.

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,800
But before that, a city was an unintentional playground for plagues

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
and a grim machine to sort the immune from the rest.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
So the deeper answer is that the New World didn't have plagues

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,800
because the New World didn't have big, dense, terribly sanitized,

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,800
deeply interconnected cities for plagues to thrive.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Okay, but the New World wasn't completely barren of cities

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
and tribes weren't completely isolated.

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Otherwise, the newly arrived smallpox in the 1400s couldn't have spread.

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Cities are only part of the puzzle.

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,800
They're required for plagues, but cities don't make the germs that start the plagues.

55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Those germs come from the missing piece.

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Now, most germs don't want to kill you for the same reason you don't want to burn down your house.

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Germs live in you.

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Chronic diseases like leprosy are terrible

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
because they're very good at living in you and not killing you.

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Plague lethality is an accident, a misunderstanding,

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
because the germs that cause plagues don't know they're in humans.

62
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
They think they're in this.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Plagues come from animals.

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Whooping cough comes from pigs, as does flu, as well as from birds.

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Our friend the cow alone is responsible for measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,800
For the cow, these diseases are no big deal, like colds for us.

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,800
But when cow germs get in humans, the things they do to make a cow a little sick to spread

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
make humans very sick, deadly sick.

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Now, germs' jumping species is extraordinarily rare.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
That's why generations of humans can spend time around animals just fine.

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Being the patient zero of a new animal-to-human plague is winning a terrible lottery.

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
But a colonial-age city raises the odds.

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
There used to be animals everywhere.

74
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Horses, herds of livestock in the streets, open slaughterhouses, meat markets pre-refrigeration,

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
and rivers of human and animal excrement running through it all.

76
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,800
A more perfect environment for diseases to jump species could hardly be imagined.

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
So the deeper answer is that plagues come from animals,

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,800
but so rarely that you have to raise the odds with many chances for infection.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,800
And even then, the newborn plague needs a fertile environment to grow.

80
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,800
The old world had the necessary pieces in abundance.

81
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,800
But why was a city like London filled with sheep and pigs and cows and Tenochtitlan wasn't?

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,800
This brings us to the final level, for this video anyway.

83
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Some animals can be put to human use.

84
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
This is what domestication means.

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Animals you can breed, not just hunt.

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Forget for a moment the modern world.

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Go back to 10,000 BC when tribes of humans reached just about everywhere.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,800
If you were in one of these tribes, what local animals could you capture alive and successfully pen to breed?

89
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Maybe you're in North Dakota and thinking about catching a buffalo.

90
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,800
An unpredictable, violent tank on hooves that can outrun you across the plains,

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
leap over your head and travels in herds thousands strong.

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Oh, and you have no horses to help you because there are no horses on the continent.

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Horses live here and won't be brought over until too late.

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
It's just you, a couple buddies, and stone-based tools.

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
American Indians didn't fail to domesticate buffalo because they couldn't figure it out.

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,800
They failed because it's a buffalo. No one could do it.

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Buffalo would have been amazing creatures to put to human work back in BC, but it's not going to happen.

98
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Humans have only barely domesticated buffalo with all of our modern tools.

99
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,800
The New World didn't have good animal candidates for domestication.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Almost everything big enough to be useful is also too dangerous or too agile.

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Meanwhile, the Fertile Crescent to Central Europe had cows and pigs and sheep and goats.

102
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Easy peasy animals comparatively begging to be domesticated.

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
A wild boar is something to contend with if you have only stone tools,

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,800
but it's possible to catch and pen and breed and feed to eat,

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,800
because pigs can't leap to the sky or crush all resistance beneath their hooves.

106
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,800
In the New World, the only native domestication contestant was llamas.

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,800
They're better than nothing, which is probably why the biggest cities existed in South America,

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
but they're no cow.

109
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Ever try to manage a herd of llamas in the mountains of Peru?

110
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Yeah, you can do it, but it's not fun.

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Nothing but drama, these llamas.

112
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,800
These might seem cherry-picked examples, because aren't there hundreds of thousands of species of animals?

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Yes, but when you're stuck at the bottom of the tech tree, almost none of them can be domesticated.

114
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:57,800
From the dawn of man until this fateful meeting, humans domesticated maybe a baker's dozen of unique species the world over.

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,800
And even to get to that high a number, you need to stretch it to include honeybees and silkworms.

116
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Nice to have, but you can't build a civilization on a foundation of honey alone.

117
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,800
These early tribes weren't smarter or better at domestication.

118
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
The Old World had more valuable and easy animals.

119
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
With dogs, herding sheep and cattle is easier.

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Now humans have a buddy to keep an eye on the clothing factory and the milk and cheeseburger machine and the plow puller.

121
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Now farming is easier, which means there's more benefit to staying put,

122
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
which means more domestication, which means more food, which means more people and more density,

123
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
and oh, look where we're going.

124
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Citiesville, population lots, bring your animals, plagues, welcome.

125
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
That is the full answer.

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,800
The lack of New World animals to domesticate limited not only exposure to germ sources,

127
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
but also limited food production, which limited population growth, which limited cities,

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
which made plagues in the New World an almost impossibility.

129
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,800
In the Old, exactly the reverse, and thus a continent full of plague and a continent devoid of it.

130
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,800
So when ships landed in the New World, there was no America Pox to bring back.

131
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,800
The game of civilization has nothing to do with the players and everything to do with the map.

132
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Access to domesticated animals in numbers and diversity is the key resource to bootstrapping a complex society from nothing.

133
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,800
And that complexity brings with it, unintentionally, a passive biological weaponry devastating to outsiders.

134
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Start the game again, but move the domesticatable animals across the sea,

135
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,800
and history's arrow of disease and death flows in the opposite direction.

136
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
This still does leave one last question.

137
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Just why are some animals domesticatable and others not?

138
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Why couldn't American Indians domesticate deer?

139
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Why can't zebras be domesticated? They look just like horses.

140
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
And what does it mean to tame an animal?

141
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
To answer that, click here for part 2.
