00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Between the first Europeans arriving in 1492 and the Victorian age,

00:05.800 --> 00:11.600
the indigenous population of the New World dropped by at least 90%.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.100
The cause? Not the conquistadors and company.

00:15.100 --> 00:22.000
They killed lots of people, but their death count is nothing compared to what they brought with them.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.300
Smallpox, typhus, tuberculosis, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, mumps, measles, and more

00:28.300 --> 00:31.800
leapt from those first explorers to the coastal tribes,

00:31.800 --> 00:39.800
then onward the microscopic invaders spread through a hemisphere of people with no defenses against them.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.300
Tens of millions died.

00:42.300 --> 00:49.300
These germs decided the fate of these battles long before the fighting started.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.800
Now ask yourself, why didn't the Europeans get sick?

00:52.800 --> 01:00.800
If New Worlders were vulnerable to Old World diseases, then surely Old Worlders would be vulnerable to New World diseases.

01:00.800 --> 01:08.800
Yet there was no America pox spreading eastward, infecting Europe, and cutting the population from 90 million to 9.

01:08.800 --> 01:17.800
Had America pox existed, it would have rather dampened European ability for transatlantic expansion.

01:17.800 --> 01:25.800
To answer why this didn't happen, we need first to distinguish regular diseases like the common cold from what we'll call plagues.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.800
First, plagues spread quickly between people.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.800
Sneezes spread plagues faster than handshakes which are faster than closeness.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.800
Plagues use more of this than this.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.800
Secondly and importantly, they kill you quickly or you become immune.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.800
Catch a plague and you're dead within 7 to 30 days.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.800
Survive and you'll never get it again.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
Your body has learned to fight it.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.800
You might still carry it, the plague lives in you, you can spread it, but it can't hurt you.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.800
The surface answer to this question isn't that Europeans had better immune systems to fight off New World plagues.

01:59.800 --> 02:05.800
It's that the New World didn't have plagues for them to catch.

02:05.800 --> 02:11.800
They had regular diseases, but there was no America pox to carry.

02:11.800 --> 02:17.800
These are history's biggest killers and they all come from the old world.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
But why?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.800
Let's dig deeper and talk cholera.

02:21.800 --> 02:28.800
A plague that spreads if your civilization does a bad job of separating drinking water from pooping water.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.800
London was terrible at this, making it the cholera capital of the world.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.800
Cholera can rip through dense neighborhoods killing swaths of the population before moving onward.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.800
But that's the key. It has to move on.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.800
In a small, isolated group, a plague-like cholera cannot survive.

02:49.800 --> 02:55.800
It kills all available victims, leaving only the immune and then there's nowhere to go.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.800
It's a fire that burns through its fuel.

02:58.800 --> 03:05.800
But a city, shining city on the hill, to which rural migrants flock, where hundreds of babies are born a day,

03:05.800 --> 03:10.800
this is sanctuary for the fire of plague.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.800
Fresh kindling comes to it.

03:13.800 --> 03:19.800
The plague flares and smolders and flares and smolders again, impossible to extinguish.

03:19.800 --> 03:25.800
Historically, in city borders, plagues killed faster than people could breed.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.800
Cities grew because more people moved to them than died inside of them.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.800
Cities only started growing from their own population in the 1900s,

03:34.800 --> 03:39.800
when medicine finally left its leeches and bloodletting phase and entered its soap and soup phase,

03:39.800 --> 03:43.800
giving humans some tools to slow death.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.800
But before that, a city was an unintentional playground for plagues

03:48.800 --> 03:52.800
and a grim machine to sort the immune from the rest.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.800
So the deeper answer is that the New World didn't have plagues

03:56.800 --> 04:02.800
because the New World didn't have big, dense, terribly sanitized,

04:02.800 --> 04:06.800
deeply interconnected cities for plagues to thrive.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.800
Okay, but the New World wasn't completely barren of cities

04:10.800 --> 04:13.800
and tribes weren't completely isolated.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.800
Otherwise, the newly arrived smallpox in the 1400s couldn't have spread.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.800
Cities are only part of the puzzle.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.800
They're required for plagues, but cities don't make the germs that start the plagues.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
Those germs come from the missing piece.

04:29.800 --> 04:35.800
Now, most germs don't want to kill you for the same reason you don't want to burn down your house.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.800
Germs live in you.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.800
Chronic diseases like leprosy are terrible

04:40.800 --> 04:44.800
because they're very good at living in you and not killing you.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.800
Plague lethality is an accident, a misunderstanding,

04:48.800 --> 04:53.800
because the germs that cause plagues don't know they're in humans.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.800
They think they're in this.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.800
Plagues come from animals.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.800
Whooping cough comes from pigs, as does flu, as well as from birds.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.800
Our friend the cow alone is responsible for measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.800
For the cow, these diseases are no big deal, like colds for us.

05:12.800 --> 05:18.800
But when cow germs get in humans, the things they do to make a cow a little sick to spread

05:18.800 --> 05:21.800
make humans very sick, deadly sick.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.800
Now, germs' jumping species is extraordinarily rare.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.800
That's why generations of humans can spend time around animals just fine.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.800
Being the patient zero of a new animal-to-human plague is winning a terrible lottery.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.800
But a colonial-age city raises the odds.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.800
There used to be animals everywhere.

05:41.800 --> 05:48.800
Horses, herds of livestock in the streets, open slaughterhouses, meat markets pre-refrigeration,

05:48.800 --> 05:52.800
and rivers of human and animal excrement running through it all.

05:52.800 --> 05:58.800
A more perfect environment for diseases to jump species could hardly be imagined.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.800
So the deeper answer is that plagues come from animals,

06:01.800 --> 06:07.800
but so rarely that you have to raise the odds with many chances for infection.

06:07.800 --> 06:13.800
And even then, the newborn plague needs a fertile environment to grow.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.800
The old world had the necessary pieces in abundance.

06:18.800 --> 06:25.800
But why was a city like London filled with sheep and pigs and cows and Tenochtitlan wasn't?

06:25.800 --> 06:29.800
This brings us to the final level, for this video anyway.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.800
Some animals can be put to human use.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
This is what domestication means.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.800
Animals you can breed, not just hunt.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.800
Forget for a moment the modern world.

06:40.800 --> 06:45.800
Go back to 10,000 BC when tribes of humans reached just about everywhere.

06:45.800 --> 06:53.800
If you were in one of these tribes, what local animals could you capture alive and successfully pen to breed?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.800
Maybe you're in North Dakota and thinking about catching a buffalo.

06:56.800 --> 07:02.800
An unpredictable, violent tank on hooves that can outrun you across the plains,

07:02.800 --> 07:06.800
leap over your head and travels in herds thousands strong.

07:06.800 --> 07:12.800
Oh, and you have no horses to help you because there are no horses on the continent.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.800
Horses live here and won't be brought over until too late.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.800
It's just you, a couple buddies, and stone-based tools.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.800
American Indians didn't fail to domesticate buffalo because they couldn't figure it out.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.800
They failed because it's a buffalo. No one could do it.

07:29.800 --> 07:36.800
Buffalo would have been amazing creatures to put to human work back in BC, but it's not going to happen.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.800
Humans have only barely domesticated buffalo with all of our modern tools.

07:41.800 --> 07:46.800
The New World didn't have good animal candidates for domestication.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.800
Almost everything big enough to be useful is also too dangerous or too agile.

07:51.800 --> 07:56.800
Meanwhile, the Fertile Crescent to Central Europe had cows and pigs and sheep and goats.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.800
Easy peasy animals comparatively begging to be domesticated.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.800
A wild boar is something to contend with if you have only stone tools,

08:05.800 --> 08:10.800
but it's possible to catch and pen and breed and feed to eat,

08:10.800 --> 08:15.800
because pigs can't leap to the sky or crush all resistance beneath their hooves.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.800
In the New World, the only native domestication contestant was llamas.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.800
They're better than nothing, which is probably why the biggest cities existed in South America,

08:25.800 --> 08:27.800
but they're no cow.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.800
Ever try to manage a herd of llamas in the mountains of Peru?

08:31.800 --> 08:34.800
Yeah, you can do it, but it's not fun.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.800
Nothing but drama, these llamas.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.800
These might seem cherry-picked examples, because aren't there hundreds of thousands of species of animals?

08:41.800 --> 08:47.800
Yes, but when you're stuck at the bottom of the tech tree, almost none of them can be domesticated.

08:47.800 --> 08:57.800
From the dawn of man until this fateful meeting, humans domesticated maybe a baker's dozen of unique species the world over.

08:57.800 --> 09:03.800
And even to get to that high a number, you need to stretch it to include honeybees and silkworms.

09:03.800 --> 09:09.800
Nice to have, but you can't build a civilization on a foundation of honey alone.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.800
These early tribes weren't smarter or better at domestication.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.800
The Old World had more valuable and easy animals.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.800
With dogs, herding sheep and cattle is easier.

09:20.800 --> 09:26.800
Now humans have a buddy to keep an eye on the clothing factory and the milk and cheeseburger machine and the plow puller.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.800
Now farming is easier, which means there's more benefit to staying put,

09:30.800 --> 09:34.800
which means more domestication, which means more food, which means more people and more density,

09:34.800 --> 09:36.800
and oh, look where we're going.

09:36.800 --> 09:41.800
Citiesville, population lots, bring your animals, plagues, welcome.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
That is the full answer.

09:43.800 --> 09:48.800
The lack of New World animals to domesticate limited not only exposure to germ sources,

09:48.800 --> 09:52.800
but also limited food production, which limited population growth, which limited cities,

09:52.800 --> 09:56.800
which made plagues in the New World an almost impossibility.

09:56.800 --> 10:03.800
In the Old, exactly the reverse, and thus a continent full of plague and a continent devoid of it.

10:03.800 --> 10:09.800
So when ships landed in the New World, there was no America Pox to bring back.

10:09.800 --> 10:16.800
The game of civilization has nothing to do with the players and everything to do with the map.

10:16.800 --> 10:24.800
Access to domesticated animals in numbers and diversity is the key resource to bootstrapping a complex society from nothing.

10:24.800 --> 10:32.800
And that complexity brings with it, unintentionally, a passive biological weaponry devastating to outsiders.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.800
Start the game again, but move the domesticatable animals across the sea,

10:37.800 --> 10:44.800
and history's arrow of disease and death flows in the opposite direction.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.800
This still does leave one last question.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.800
Just why are some animals domesticatable and others not?

10:55.800 --> 10:58.800
Why couldn't American Indians domesticate deer?

10:58.800 --> 11:02.800
Why can't zebras be domesticated? They look just like horses.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.800
And what does it mean to tame an animal?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.800
To answer that, click here for part 2.
