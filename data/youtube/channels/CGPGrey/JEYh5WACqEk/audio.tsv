0	5800	Between the first Europeans arriving in 1492 and the Victorian age,
5800	11600	the indigenous population of the New World dropped by at least 90%.
11600	15100	The cause? Not the conquistadors and company.
15100	22000	They killed lots of people, but their death count is nothing compared to what they brought with them.
22000	28300	Smallpox, typhus, tuberculosis, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, mumps, measles, and more
28300	31800	leapt from those first explorers to the coastal tribes,
31800	39800	then onward the microscopic invaders spread through a hemisphere of people with no defenses against them.
39800	42300	Tens of millions died.
42300	49300	These germs decided the fate of these battles long before the fighting started.
49300	52800	Now ask yourself, why didn't the Europeans get sick?
52800	60800	If New Worlders were vulnerable to Old World diseases, then surely Old Worlders would be vulnerable to New World diseases.
60800	68800	Yet there was no America pox spreading eastward, infecting Europe, and cutting the population from 90 million to 9.
68800	77800	Had America pox existed, it would have rather dampened European ability for transatlantic expansion.
77800	85800	To answer why this didn't happen, we need first to distinguish regular diseases like the common cold from what we'll call plagues.
85800	88800	First, plagues spread quickly between people.
88800	93800	Sneezes spread plagues faster than handshakes which are faster than closeness.
93800	96800	Plagues use more of this than this.
96800	100800	Secondly and importantly, they kill you quickly or you become immune.
100800	104800	Catch a plague and you're dead within 7 to 30 days.
104800	106800	Survive and you'll never get it again.
106800	108800	Your body has learned to fight it.
108800	114800	You might still carry it, the plague lives in you, you can spread it, but it can't hurt you.
114800	119800	The surface answer to this question isn't that Europeans had better immune systems to fight off New World plagues.
119800	125800	It's that the New World didn't have plagues for them to catch.
125800	131800	They had regular diseases, but there was no America pox to carry.
131800	137800	These are history's biggest killers and they all come from the old world.
137800	138800	But why?
138800	141800	Let's dig deeper and talk cholera.
141800	148800	A plague that spreads if your civilization does a bad job of separating drinking water from pooping water.
148800	153800	London was terrible at this, making it the cholera capital of the world.
153800	160800	Cholera can rip through dense neighborhoods killing swaths of the population before moving onward.
160800	164800	But that's the key. It has to move on.
164800	169800	In a small, isolated group, a plague-like cholera cannot survive.
169800	175800	It kills all available victims, leaving only the immune and then there's nowhere to go.
175800	178800	It's a fire that burns through its fuel.
178800	185800	But a city, shining city on the hill, to which rural migrants flock, where hundreds of babies are born a day,
185800	190800	this is sanctuary for the fire of plague.
190800	193800	Fresh kindling comes to it.
193800	199800	The plague flares and smolders and flares and smolders again, impossible to extinguish.
199800	205800	Historically, in city borders, plagues killed faster than people could breed.
205800	210800	Cities grew because more people moved to them than died inside of them.
210800	214800	Cities only started growing from their own population in the 1900s,
214800	219800	when medicine finally left its leeches and bloodletting phase and entered its soap and soup phase,
219800	223800	giving humans some tools to slow death.
223800	228800	But before that, a city was an unintentional playground for plagues
228800	232800	and a grim machine to sort the immune from the rest.
232800	236800	So the deeper answer is that the New World didn't have plagues
236800	242800	because the New World didn't have big, dense, terribly sanitized,
242800	246800	deeply interconnected cities for plagues to thrive.
246800	250800	Okay, but the New World wasn't completely barren of cities
250800	253800	and tribes weren't completely isolated.
253800	258800	Otherwise, the newly arrived smallpox in the 1400s couldn't have spread.
258800	260800	Cities are only part of the puzzle.
260800	266800	They're required for plagues, but cities don't make the germs that start the plagues.
266800	269800	Those germs come from the missing piece.
269800	275800	Now, most germs don't want to kill you for the same reason you don't want to burn down your house.
275800	277800	Germs live in you.
277800	280800	Chronic diseases like leprosy are terrible
280800	284800	because they're very good at living in you and not killing you.
284800	288800	Plague lethality is an accident, a misunderstanding,
288800	293800	because the germs that cause plagues don't know they're in humans.
293800	295800	They think they're in this.
295800	298800	Plagues come from animals.
298800	302800	Whooping cough comes from pigs, as does flu, as well as from birds.
302800	307800	Our friend the cow alone is responsible for measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox.
307800	312800	For the cow, these diseases are no big deal, like colds for us.
312800	318800	But when cow germs get in humans, the things they do to make a cow a little sick to spread
318800	321800	make humans very sick, deadly sick.
321800	325800	Now, germs' jumping species is extraordinarily rare.
325800	329800	That's why generations of humans can spend time around animals just fine.
329800	335800	Being the patient zero of a new animal-to-human plague is winning a terrible lottery.
335800	338800	But a colonial-age city raises the odds.
338800	341800	There used to be animals everywhere.
341800	348800	Horses, herds of livestock in the streets, open slaughterhouses, meat markets pre-refrigeration,
348800	352800	and rivers of human and animal excrement running through it all.
352800	358800	A more perfect environment for diseases to jump species could hardly be imagined.
358800	361800	So the deeper answer is that plagues come from animals,
361800	367800	but so rarely that you have to raise the odds with many chances for infection.
367800	373800	And even then, the newborn plague needs a fertile environment to grow.
373800	378800	The old world had the necessary pieces in abundance.
378800	385800	But why was a city like London filled with sheep and pigs and cows and Tenochtitlan wasn't?
385800	389800	This brings us to the final level, for this video anyway.
389800	392800	Some animals can be put to human use.
392800	394800	This is what domestication means.
394800	398800	Animals you can breed, not just hunt.
398800	400800	Forget for a moment the modern world.
400800	405800	Go back to 10,000 BC when tribes of humans reached just about everywhere.
405800	413800	If you were in one of these tribes, what local animals could you capture alive and successfully pen to breed?
413800	416800	Maybe you're in North Dakota and thinking about catching a buffalo.
416800	422800	An unpredictable, violent tank on hooves that can outrun you across the plains,
422800	426800	leap over your head and travels in herds thousands strong.
426800	432800	Oh, and you have no horses to help you because there are no horses on the continent.
432800	436800	Horses live here and won't be brought over until too late.
436800	440800	It's just you, a couple buddies, and stone-based tools.
440800	444800	American Indians didn't fail to domesticate buffalo because they couldn't figure it out.
444800	449800	They failed because it's a buffalo. No one could do it.
449800	456800	Buffalo would have been amazing creatures to put to human work back in BC, but it's not going to happen.
456800	461800	Humans have only barely domesticated buffalo with all of our modern tools.
461800	466800	The New World didn't have good animal candidates for domestication.
466800	471800	Almost everything big enough to be useful is also too dangerous or too agile.
471800	476800	Meanwhile, the Fertile Crescent to Central Europe had cows and pigs and sheep and goats.
476800	481800	Easy peasy animals comparatively begging to be domesticated.
481800	485800	A wild boar is something to contend with if you have only stone tools,
485800	490800	but it's possible to catch and pen and breed and feed to eat,
490800	495800	because pigs can't leap to the sky or crush all resistance beneath their hooves.
495800	500800	In the New World, the only native domestication contestant was llamas.
500800	505800	They're better than nothing, which is probably why the biggest cities existed in South America,
505800	507800	but they're no cow.
507800	511800	Ever try to manage a herd of llamas in the mountains of Peru?
511800	514800	Yeah, you can do it, but it's not fun.
514800	516800	Nothing but drama, these llamas.
516800	521800	These might seem cherry-picked examples, because aren't there hundreds of thousands of species of animals?
521800	527800	Yes, but when you're stuck at the bottom of the tech tree, almost none of them can be domesticated.
527800	537800	From the dawn of man until this fateful meeting, humans domesticated maybe a baker's dozen of unique species the world over.
537800	543800	And even to get to that high a number, you need to stretch it to include honeybees and silkworms.
543800	549800	Nice to have, but you can't build a civilization on a foundation of honey alone.
549800	553800	These early tribes weren't smarter or better at domestication.
553800	557800	The Old World had more valuable and easy animals.
557800	560800	With dogs, herding sheep and cattle is easier.
560800	566800	Now humans have a buddy to keep an eye on the clothing factory and the milk and cheeseburger machine and the plow puller.
566800	570800	Now farming is easier, which means there's more benefit to staying put,
570800	574800	which means more domestication, which means more food, which means more people and more density,
574800	576800	and oh, look where we're going.
576800	581800	Citiesville, population lots, bring your animals, plagues, welcome.
581800	583800	That is the full answer.
583800	588800	The lack of New World animals to domesticate limited not only exposure to germ sources,
588800	592800	but also limited food production, which limited population growth, which limited cities,
592800	596800	which made plagues in the New World an almost impossibility.
596800	603800	In the Old, exactly the reverse, and thus a continent full of plague and a continent devoid of it.
603800	609800	So when ships landed in the New World, there was no America Pox to bring back.
609800	616800	The game of civilization has nothing to do with the players and everything to do with the map.
616800	624800	Access to domesticated animals in numbers and diversity is the key resource to bootstrapping a complex society from nothing.
624800	632800	And that complexity brings with it, unintentionally, a passive biological weaponry devastating to outsiders.
632800	637800	Start the game again, but move the domesticatable animals across the sea,
637800	644800	and history's arrow of disease and death flows in the opposite direction.
648800	651800	This still does leave one last question.
651800	655800	Just why are some animals domesticatable and others not?
655800	658800	Why couldn't American Indians domesticate deer?
658800	662800	Why can't zebras be domesticated? They look just like horses.
662800	665800	And what does it mean to tame an animal?
