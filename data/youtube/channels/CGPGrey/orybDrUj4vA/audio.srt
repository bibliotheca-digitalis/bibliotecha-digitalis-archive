Hello Internet. You know I love me some voting videos. These, however, are mostly about how

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,720
organizations can improve their elections. But normal people need better voting too.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,560
Say a group of you are trying to decide what to have for dinner. There are three options.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,060
Steak Shack I'll meet all the time, Veggie Villa hope you like lettuce, and Burger Barn

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,820
every burger ever including the ones made from not meat. Just asking people to pick

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,960
their favorite as normal results in three starved carnivores. Now you could use one

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,500
of these better methods I've talked about before, but seriously who wants to break out

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,180
the pens and paper and nerd to crank the algorithm for a question that should be answered

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,660
in under 30 seconds? No one. So here's the fastest way to vote in a group. None of that

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,020
stuff required. Don't blink or you'll miss it. Hands up if you're good with Steak Shack.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,580
Hands up if you're good with Burger Barn. Hands up if you're good with Veggie Villa.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,540
Boom. Election over. Burger Barn domination. This time everybody gets to live. The difference?

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,260
Letting people vote more than once. If you're in a group and picking from several options

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,260
quickly this is the way to go. It's a world changingly great at stopping arguments like,

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,620
for example, in a classroom. Hey kids we're going to watch a movie today because I just

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,580
can't anymore. So let's go. Hands up for Terminator 2. Hands up for Spirited Away. Hands up for

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,480
Wally. Done. Wally it is. Lazy bonus. If you're in charge of the vote, no need to keep an

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,580
eye out for those aspiring dictators who subvert democracy by voting more than once. Voting

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,440
more than once is the whole point. So next time you're in a group trying to decide, don't

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,020
just ask for the favorite, ask for all the okays. Best way to decide quickly. No pen

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,020
or paper or nerd required.
