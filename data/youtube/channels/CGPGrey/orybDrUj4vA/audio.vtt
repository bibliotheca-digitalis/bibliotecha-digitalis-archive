Hello Internet. You know I love me some voting videos. These, however, are mostly about how

00:05.180 --> 00:09.720
organizations can improve their elections. But normal people need better voting too.

00:09.720 --> 00:13.560
Say a group of you are trying to decide what to have for dinner. There are three options.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.060
Steak Shack I'll meet all the time, Veggie Villa hope you like lettuce, and Burger Barn

00:17.060 --> 00:20.820
every burger ever including the ones made from not meat. Just asking people to pick

00:20.820 --> 00:24.960
their favorite as normal results in three starved carnivores. Now you could use one

00:24.960 --> 00:28.500
of these better methods I've talked about before, but seriously who wants to break out

00:28.500 --> 00:32.180
the pens and paper and nerd to crank the algorithm for a question that should be answered

00:32.180 --> 00:35.660
in under 30 seconds? No one. So here's the fastest way to vote in a group. None of that

00:35.660 --> 00:39.020
stuff required. Don't blink or you'll miss it. Hands up if you're good with Steak Shack.

00:39.020 --> 00:41.580
Hands up if you're good with Burger Barn. Hands up if you're good with Veggie Villa.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.540
Boom. Election over. Burger Barn domination. This time everybody gets to live. The difference?

00:46.540 --> 00:50.260
Letting people vote more than once. If you're in a group and picking from several options

00:50.260 --> 00:55.260
quickly this is the way to go. It's a world changingly great at stopping arguments like,

00:55.260 --> 00:59.620
for example, in a classroom. Hey kids we're going to watch a movie today because I just

00:59.620 --> 01:04.580
can't anymore. So let's go. Hands up for Terminator 2. Hands up for Spirited Away. Hands up for

01:04.580 --> 01:08.480
Wally. Done. Wally it is. Lazy bonus. If you're in charge of the vote, no need to keep an

01:08.480 --> 01:12.580
eye out for those aspiring dictators who subvert democracy by voting more than once. Voting

01:12.580 --> 01:16.440
more than once is the whole point. So next time you're in a group trying to decide, don't

01:16.440 --> 01:21.020
just ask for the favorite, ask for all the okays. Best way to decide quickly. No pen

01:21.020 --> 01:28.020
or paper or nerd required.
