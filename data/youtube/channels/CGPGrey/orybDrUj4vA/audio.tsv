0	5180	Hello Internet. You know I love me some voting videos. These, however, are mostly about how
5180	9720	organizations can improve their elections. But normal people need better voting too.
9720	13560	Say a group of you are trying to decide what to have for dinner. There are three options.
13560	17060	Steak Shack I'll meet all the time, Veggie Villa hope you like lettuce, and Burger Barn
17060	20820	every burger ever including the ones made from not meat. Just asking people to pick
20820	24960	their favorite as normal results in three starved carnivores. Now you could use one
24960	28500	of these better methods I've talked about before, but seriously who wants to break out
28500	32180	the pens and paper and nerd to crank the algorithm for a question that should be answered
32180	35660	in under 30 seconds? No one. So here's the fastest way to vote in a group. None of that
35660	39020	stuff required. Don't blink or you'll miss it. Hands up if you're good with Steak Shack.
39020	41580	Hands up if you're good with Burger Barn. Hands up if you're good with Veggie Villa.
41580	46540	Boom. Election over. Burger Barn domination. This time everybody gets to live. The difference?
46540	50260	Letting people vote more than once. If you're in a group and picking from several options
50260	55260	quickly this is the way to go. It's a world changingly great at stopping arguments like,
55260	59620	for example, in a classroom. Hey kids we're going to watch a movie today because I just
59620	64580	can't anymore. So let's go. Hands up for Terminator 2. Hands up for Spirited Away. Hands up for
64580	68480	Wally. Done. Wally it is. Lazy bonus. If you're in charge of the vote, no need to keep an
68480	72580	eye out for those aspiring dictators who subvert democracy by voting more than once. Voting
72580	76440	more than once is the whole point. So next time you're in a group trying to decide, don't
76440	81020	just ask for the favorite, ask for all the okays. Best way to decide quickly. No pen
81020	88020	or paper or nerd required.
