00:00.000 --> 00:08.300
History has a long and rich tradition of apocalyptic predictions, all of which were wrong, yet

00:08.300 --> 00:12.100
some people still think that this time round in 2012 is the real deal.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.340
Why 2012?

00:13.340 --> 00:15.180
Because of ancient Mayan calendars.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.180
Obviously.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.620
Mayan calendars not only recorded the days and years, but also longer cycles of about

00:19.620 --> 00:23.100
five millennia, so they could easily make calendars that went thousands of years into

00:23.100 --> 00:24.100
the future.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.840
But of course, thousands of years in the future from thousands of years ago brings us to current

00:27.840 --> 00:30.500
times when the Mayan calendars stop in 2012.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.120
Modern New Agey people decided that the wise Mayans stopped making calendars because they

00:34.120 --> 00:35.860
knew when the world would end.

00:35.860 --> 00:39.840
And because New Agers are happy, though scientifically illiterate people, their vision of 2012 was

00:39.840 --> 00:44.020
a great spiritual awakening or world reboot or other hippie consciousness expanding nonsense

00:44.020 --> 00:47.660
that the Mayans, who spent time pulling strings of thorns through people's tongues, probably

00:47.660 --> 00:49.060
didn't have in mind.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.880
To a normal person, the thought that, calendar finished, therefore end of the world is an

00:52.880 --> 00:54.880
odd conclusion to draw.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.820
After all, the amount of time in the universe is infinite and the amount of stone is limited,

00:58.820 --> 01:01.900
so at some point the Mayans had to stop carving calendars.

01:01.900 --> 01:05.140
But never mind, what should have stayed a fringe belief turned into mass hysteria with

01:05.140 --> 01:09.940
the 2012 disaster movie that swept the Academy Awards and the numerous Emmy nominated Apocalypse

01:09.940 --> 01:13.800
documentaries on... the History Channel.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.340
What happened to you guys?

01:15.340 --> 01:19.260
Anyway, after this, NASA became so inundated with questions that they had to take time

01:19.260 --> 01:22.940
away from their busy robot building, frontier pushing, knowledge expanding, civilization

01:22.940 --> 01:27.740
inspiring schedule, to write a webpage explaining that no, a human sacrificing stone age society

01:27.740 --> 01:31.260
with neither wheels to pull carts nor glass to make telescopes didn't know more about

01:31.260 --> 01:34.560
science at the dawn of history than real scientists do today.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.700
But the parade of crazy marched on anyway, making wilder and wilder predictions for Earth

01:38.700 --> 01:42.680
including geomagnetic reversal, a process that unfolds on a geologic timescale not a

01:42.680 --> 01:47.040
single day, a collision with mysterious Planet X that no astronomers have found, a local

01:47.040 --> 01:51.000
star going supernova despite there being no such candidates, an alien invasion which is

01:51.000 --> 01:55.820
ludicrous on the face of it, or is it, and a galactic synchronization beam, whatever

01:55.820 --> 01:56.820
the hell that is.

01:56.820 --> 02:00.700
A sane person at this point would wonder how the Mayans were able to predict astrophysical

02:00.700 --> 02:04.100
anomalies thousands of years in advance and millions of miles away yet didn't foresee

02:04.100 --> 02:06.640
the Spanish coming across the Atlantic.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.000
And that's because the Mayans never predicted Apocalypse.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.320
The only people to claim that Mayans knew about the end of the world were distinctly

02:14.320 --> 02:15.820
not Mayans.
