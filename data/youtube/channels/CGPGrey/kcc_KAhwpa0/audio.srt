1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
History has a long and rich tradition of apocalyptic predictions, all of which were wrong, yet

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,100
some people still think that this time round in 2012 is the real deal.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,340
Why 2012?

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,180
Because of ancient Mayan calendars.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,180
Obviously.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,620
Mayan calendars not only recorded the days and years, but also longer cycles of about

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,100
five millennia, so they could easily make calendars that went thousands of years into

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,100
the future.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,840
But of course, thousands of years in the future from thousands of years ago brings us to current

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,500
times when the Mayan calendars stop in 2012.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,120
Modern New Agey people decided that the wise Mayans stopped making calendars because they

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,860
knew when the world would end.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,840
And because New Agers are happy, though scientifically illiterate people, their vision of 2012 was

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,020
a great spiritual awakening or world reboot or other hippie consciousness expanding nonsense

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,660
that the Mayans, who spent time pulling strings of thorns through people's tongues, probably

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,060
didn't have in mind.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,880
To a normal person, the thought that, calendar finished, therefore end of the world is an

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
odd conclusion to draw.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,820
After all, the amount of time in the universe is infinite and the amount of stone is limited,

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,900
so at some point the Mayans had to stop carving calendars.

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,140
But never mind, what should have stayed a fringe belief turned into mass hysteria with

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,940
the 2012 disaster movie that swept the Academy Awards and the numerous Emmy nominated Apocalypse

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,800
documentaries on... the History Channel.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,340
What happened to you guys?

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,260
Anyway, after this, NASA became so inundated with questions that they had to take time

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,940
away from their busy robot building, frontier pushing, knowledge expanding, civilization

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,740
inspiring schedule, to write a webpage explaining that no, a human sacrificing stone age society

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,260
with neither wheels to pull carts nor glass to make telescopes didn't know more about

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,560
science at the dawn of history than real scientists do today.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,700
But the parade of crazy marched on anyway, making wilder and wilder predictions for Earth

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,680
including geomagnetic reversal, a process that unfolds on a geologic timescale not a

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,040
single day, a collision with mysterious Planet X that no astronomers have found, a local

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,000
star going supernova despite there being no such candidates, an alien invasion which is

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,820
ludicrous on the face of it, or is it, and a galactic synchronization beam, whatever

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
the hell that is.

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,700
A sane person at this point would wonder how the Mayans were able to predict astrophysical

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
anomalies thousands of years in advance and millions of miles away yet didn't foresee

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,640
the Spanish coming across the Atlantic.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
And that's because the Mayans never predicted Apocalypse.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,320
The only people to claim that Mayans knew about the end of the world were distinctly

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,820
not Mayans.
