0	8300	History has a long and rich tradition of apocalyptic predictions, all of which were wrong, yet
8300	12100	some people still think that this time round in 2012 is the real deal.
12100	13340	Why 2012?
13340	15180	Because of ancient Mayan calendars.
15180	16180	Obviously.
16180	19620	Mayan calendars not only recorded the days and years, but also longer cycles of about
19620	23100	five millennia, so they could easily make calendars that went thousands of years into
23100	24100	the future.
24100	27840	But of course, thousands of years in the future from thousands of years ago brings us to current
27840	30500	times when the Mayan calendars stop in 2012.
30500	34120	Modern New Agey people decided that the wise Mayans stopped making calendars because they
34120	35860	knew when the world would end.
35860	39840	And because New Agers are happy, though scientifically illiterate people, their vision of 2012 was
39840	44020	a great spiritual awakening or world reboot or other hippie consciousness expanding nonsense
44020	47660	that the Mayans, who spent time pulling strings of thorns through people's tongues, probably
47660	49060	didn't have in mind.
49060	52880	To a normal person, the thought that, calendar finished, therefore end of the world is an
52880	54880	odd conclusion to draw.
54880	58820	After all, the amount of time in the universe is infinite and the amount of stone is limited,
58820	61900	so at some point the Mayans had to stop carving calendars.
61900	65140	But never mind, what should have stayed a fringe belief turned into mass hysteria with
65140	69940	the 2012 disaster movie that swept the Academy Awards and the numerous Emmy nominated Apocalypse
69940	73800	documentaries on... the History Channel.
73800	75340	What happened to you guys?
75340	79260	Anyway, after this, NASA became so inundated with questions that they had to take time
79260	82940	away from their busy robot building, frontier pushing, knowledge expanding, civilization
82940	87740	inspiring schedule, to write a webpage explaining that no, a human sacrificing stone age society
87740	91260	with neither wheels to pull carts nor glass to make telescopes didn't know more about
91260	94560	science at the dawn of history than real scientists do today.
94560	98700	But the parade of crazy marched on anyway, making wilder and wilder predictions for Earth
98700	102680	including geomagnetic reversal, a process that unfolds on a geologic timescale not a
102680	107040	single day, a collision with mysterious Planet X that no astronomers have found, a local
107040	111000	star going supernova despite there being no such candidates, an alien invasion which is
111000	115820	ludicrous on the face of it, or is it, and a galactic synchronization beam, whatever
115820	116820	the hell that is.
116820	120700	A sane person at this point would wonder how the Mayans were able to predict astrophysical
120700	124100	anomalies thousands of years in advance and millions of miles away yet didn't foresee
124100	126640	the Spanish coming across the Atlantic.
126640	130000	And that's because the Mayans never predicted Apocalypse.
130000	134320	The only people to claim that Mayans knew about the end of the world were distinctly
134320	135820	not Mayans.
