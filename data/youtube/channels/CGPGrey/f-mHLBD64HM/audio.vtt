WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.180
Okay, enough of that.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.340
This is not going to be a cinematic vlog here.

00:22.340 --> 00:27.340
I'm just showing you what I've been up to lately, and right now I need to get from London

00:27.340 --> 00:30.820
to Las Vegas and back again in 72 hours.

00:30.820 --> 00:35.180
This is guaranteed to be a jet lag disaster, but I have a plan.

00:35.180 --> 00:42.740
My body is going to Vegas, but my sleep cycle is going to stay in London on GMT, gray master

00:42.740 --> 00:43.740
time.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.100
I'm changing continents, but not changing time zones.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.580
I think this is a great idea, everyone I know thinks this is ridiculous, but I'm going to

00:51.580 --> 00:52.580
give it a shot.

00:52.580 --> 01:09.080
Let's go.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.260
What the heck is that?

01:11.260 --> 01:16.340
Planes wander around on the runway for a long time, so you always have to check and see

01:16.340 --> 01:17.980
when is it going to be real.

01:17.980 --> 01:18.980
It's real.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.140
Okay, this is Future Gray here, editing this video, and who obviously survived the flight.

01:23.140 --> 01:27.160
I'm not normally worried about the actual plane, this is not where my travel anxieties

01:27.160 --> 01:30.940
come from, but look at the wing of this plane as it takes off.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.380
It really bends quite a lot from the original position.

01:34.380 --> 01:38.900
Now I have flown a bunch, I don't remember ever seeing this kind of thing before, and

01:38.900 --> 01:41.660
I found it extremely concerning.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.700
Normally this is the exact moment where my travel anxieties end, and once the plane is

01:45.700 --> 01:50.700
in the air I can just sit back and read or work or whatever and just feel like I have

01:50.700 --> 01:55.660
a bunch of time on my own, but I couldn't help but keep looking at this wing and how

01:55.660 --> 01:56.660
much it bent.

01:56.660 --> 01:57.660
Is this normal?

01:57.660 --> 01:58.660
It doesn't seem normal.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.820
Anyway, back to Past Gray, who's actually on the plane.

02:01.820 --> 02:05.380
So the very vlog that I hope you're watching right now is something I'm thinking of trying

02:05.380 --> 02:10.420
to do on this trip as like an additional thing, but I gotta tell you, this wing outside the

02:10.420 --> 02:13.860
plane is extremely concerning, like it's not just me, right?

02:13.860 --> 02:14.860
It's really bent.

02:15.020 --> 02:18.540
Okay, I've been working on the vlog for a little while, but if this plan is going to

02:18.540 --> 02:23.420
work I need to get to sleep because there's only six and a half hours of flight time remaining.

02:23.420 --> 02:27.940
It's noon o'clock in Las Vegas and eight o'clock in London, which is a little early, but I've

02:27.940 --> 02:30.220
brought sleeping pills of unconsciousness.

02:30.220 --> 02:33.340
They're blue, as all such pills are legally required to be.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.940
Oh god, it's really early.

02:55.940 --> 02:57.940
Alright, I've gotta get up.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.940
I'll make up some sleep at the hotel.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.860
Traveling into the U.S. sucks.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.860
This is where I protect my phone.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.860
This is where I protect myself.

03:35.860 --> 03:37.860
Vegas, baby.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.860
Alright, it took me way longer to get through the airport than I was expecting.

03:40.860 --> 03:46.860
It's almost four in the morning in London, but it's almost 8 p.m. in Las Vegas.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.860
And I wanted to sleep a little bit when I got in, but I don't have time because I have

03:50.860 --> 03:53.860
a dinner to get to at 8.30.

03:53.860 --> 03:54.860
Okay, future Grey here.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.860
I did make it to the dinner on time, but I didn't film it, so here's some stock footage

03:58.860 --> 04:00.860
of puppies instead.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.860
And now that we're taking this little break, I'm going to let past Grey explain exactly

04:03.860 --> 04:05.860
what the plan is in detail.

04:05.860 --> 04:08.860
Let's take a look at London and let's take a look at Las Vegas.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.860
1 a.m. in London is 5 p.m. in Las Vegas.

04:10.860 --> 04:14.860
Drawing out the rest of the hours gets us this relationship between the times.

04:14.860 --> 04:19.860
Around 10 o'clock, I am definitely asleep, which expanding to 8 hours later gets us to

04:19.860 --> 04:22.860
around 6 in the morning when I'm usually waking up.

04:22.860 --> 04:27.860
This means in Las Vegas, I'm going to be asleep from about 2 in the afternoon until 10 p.m.

04:27.860 --> 04:33.860
My 8 or 9 o'clock at night is still lunchtime for people in Las Vegas, so I'm definitely

04:33.860 --> 04:34.860
available then.

04:34.860 --> 04:38.860
But if I'm willing to take away 2 hours of sleep, I can actually make it for the time

04:38.860 --> 04:42.860
when most people want to have dinner, which is 8 o'clock at night.

04:42.860 --> 04:47.860
Normally, that's my nightmare, having dinner at 8, but this time it's working in my favour.

04:47.860 --> 04:52.860
Crazy normal people like to stay up until midnight, which I could never possibly do,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.860
but now this is looking like a real possibility.

04:54.860 --> 04:59.860
There, midnight is just my 8 in the morning, at which I've already been awake for 3 hours

04:59.860 --> 05:01.860
anyway on London time.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.860
So there's a big overlap during this section.

05:03.860 --> 05:09.860
Even better, when they go to bed, it means I have the rest of a full working day essentially

05:09.860 --> 05:10.860
on my own.

05:10.860 --> 05:13.860
No one's going to be around at 4 a.m. in Las Vegas.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.860
I can just be doing whatever I want.

05:15.860 --> 05:16.860
It's my lunchtime.

05:16.860 --> 05:20.860
Normal business hours start at 9 a.m., which is my 5 in the afternoon.

05:20.860 --> 05:24.860
So as far as I'm concerned, this actually works perfectly.

05:24.860 --> 05:28.860
I can see people in the beginning of the workday, I can meet people for their lunch,

05:28.860 --> 05:32.860
I can be around for people's dinners, and I actually get to be the guy who can stay

05:32.860 --> 05:38.860
up late for post-dinner socializing, a first in my life, and I get a whole chunk of time to myself.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.860
I don't see how it could possibly go wrong.

05:40.860 --> 05:45.860
The only thing I need to do is just make sure I don't fall asleep at the wrong time.

05:45.860 --> 05:47.860
Dinner over, which was my breakfast.

05:47.860 --> 05:52.860
I'm pretty tired, but it's 10.40 a.m. on Grey Master Time.

05:52.860 --> 05:57.860
I can't fall asleep, so I'm going out for a walk to actually see Vegas for a little bit.

05:57.860 --> 06:01.860
Vegas really is the city where I think this plan can work,

06:01.860 --> 06:07.860
because if there's one place that doesn't want you to know what time it really is, it's Las Vegas.

06:07.860 --> 06:12.860
The walk helped. Now it's time to take advantage of everybody being asleep.

06:12.860 --> 06:15.860
But I need to find Bingo.

06:15.860 --> 06:23.860
Target acquired. Time to return to home base and edit an episode of Hello Internet as the sun rises.

06:31.860 --> 06:59.860
It's a funny setup, but it worked.

06:59.860 --> 07:06.860
Alright, I'm getting pretty tired when I shouldn't be, so I'm just standing in the sun for a while to remind my brain to stay awake

07:06.860 --> 07:13.860
before heading off to meet some people for breakfast and then lunch, but I didn't film that, so here's a sleepy hedgehog instead.

07:13.860 --> 07:19.860
Alright, it's 9.30 in London, even though it's only 1.30 in Las Vegas, and I am exhausted.

07:19.860 --> 07:25.860
It's been a long day. I lost more sleep than I expected because of the flight and the time it took to get to the airport.

07:25.860 --> 07:30.860
At least one day has been successfully accomplished, but now I am going to bed.

07:35.860 --> 07:39.860
Okay, this is the first time that I'm waking up actually according to the schedule.

07:39.860 --> 07:45.860
So far, so good. I have a 9.30 dinner that I need to go catch, which is actually going to be my breakfast.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.860
You know the drill.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.860
People stayed up until way late this time.

07:50.860 --> 07:56.860
I'm never the guy who gets to close down a party because I'm Mr. In My Pajamas at 8 p.m.,

07:56.860 --> 08:01.860
but now the tables have turned and I can be the last one who stays awake.

08:01.860 --> 08:06.860
I have the whole day ahead of me, but I'm skipping to the end because I don't want to spend my whole day filming things,

08:06.860 --> 08:09.860
but I saw a big shoe, I saw some robots taking our jobs,

08:12.860 --> 08:16.860
took a car, met some people for their lunch and my dinner,

08:16.860 --> 08:21.860
and now I need to go to bed pretty quick because I need to wake up earlier to catch a final dinner here.

08:23.860 --> 08:26.860
The first few minutes of waking up are not great normally,

08:26.860 --> 08:30.860
but when you have to wake up just a little bit earlier, it makes a big difference.

08:30.860 --> 08:34.860
But I know, just get into the shower and get going.

08:35.860 --> 08:41.860
I was a little bit late and a little bit lost trying to find my way to dinner, but boy was it worth it.

08:41.860 --> 08:46.860
My steak for dinner breakfast is over and this is my last morning in Las Vegas,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.860
and there's something I want to do.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.860
What is a vlog without a montage?

08:51.860 --> 08:57.860
So I'm grabbing a car to the other end of the strip and I'm going to film my way back as the sun rises.

08:57.860 --> 08:59.860
Walk with me.

11:41.860 --> 11:48.860
It's been a pretty great time in Vegas.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.860
I spent the rest of the day just packing and getting ready to go, which is totally uninteresting,

11:52.860 --> 12:00.860
and now I'm setting my alarm and a timer because I have to get up very early to catch the flight home.

12:00.860 --> 12:05.860
Future Grey here because Past Grey didn't have a whole lot of time between when he woke up,

12:05.860 --> 12:09.860
when he had to get in the car, and when he had to get to the airport.

12:09.860 --> 12:14.860
I wasn't close close, but it was a lot closer than I would normally cut these kind of things.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.860
The flight was at Las Vegas 10pm time, which was London 6am time.

12:18.860 --> 12:23.860
And this flight home turned out to be the hardest part of maintaining Grey master time.

12:23.860 --> 12:30.860
This was a night flight back. All of the lights were turned off. I was in darkness the entire time.

12:30.860 --> 12:35.860
The plane was in the air for what had been 7am for me, but I had already been up since about 3am

12:35.860 --> 12:39.860
getting ready to go to the airport, and boy did I want to sleep.

12:39.860 --> 12:44.860
To make matters worse, the power in my seat didn't work for the vast majority of the flight,

12:44.860 --> 12:51.860
so I was just counting down the time I had left on my laptop to work to give me something productive to do

12:51.860 --> 12:55.860
instead of just sitting there in the darkness trying not to fall asleep.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.860
But thankfully the nice flight attendants kept bringing me many, many cups of coffee

12:59.860 --> 13:05.860
and eventually got the power in the seat next to mine working so that I could keep doing stuff.

13:05.860 --> 13:09.860
The sun did come up, which really helped, and then we flew above the clouds for quite a while

13:09.860 --> 13:16.860
and 9 hours later descended through them into the ever bright and beautiful England.

13:16.860 --> 13:23.860
Then back through a much easier security, trains, and eventually home to a normal day where I could go to bed.

13:23.860 --> 13:28.860
Where I was going to wake up the next morning to see if this test was successful.

13:28.860 --> 13:34.860
Was I able to go to Las Vegas and come back without disrupting my regular sleep cycle?

13:41.860 --> 13:45.860
Woke up to a foggy London this morning.

13:45.860 --> 13:52.860
I know people think the city always looks like this, but in my time living here, it rarely does.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.860
So I always try to appreciate a good fog when it comes in.

13:55.860 --> 14:02.860
I'm a little tired, which is to be expected given that I've cut at least 2 hours of sleep off each night for the past 3 days.

14:02.860 --> 14:09.860
But the very fact that I am awake in London at this time in the morning after coming back from America...

14:11.860 --> 14:13.860
It feels like a miracle.

14:13.860 --> 14:18.860
Normally when I come back from America, I sleep in really late, I feel really terrible,

14:18.860 --> 14:22.860
I'm just jet lagged, and I'm totally unproductive for a week.

14:22.860 --> 14:28.860
But right now, the plan is to head into a cafe and work on one of the final drafts for the next video that's going up.

14:28.860 --> 14:34.860
That's a huge relief that this trip didn't destroy a week's worth of productivity.

14:34.860 --> 14:40.860
And I don't know if I'll do it, but I feel like it opens up the possibility of doing shorter trips to America in the future.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.860
We'll see.

14:42.860 --> 14:47.860
As for this vlog that you may or may not be watching, I don't know if I'm going to finish it.

14:47.860 --> 14:55.860
I don't know if I do finish it if I'll put it up on the channel, and in particular, I don't know if I put it up on the channel if people will like it.

14:55.860 --> 15:02.860
But for now, it's been at least an interesting, fun side project to have that's like a little bit of a secret.

15:02.860 --> 15:07.860
Which you, dear potential future viewer, may or may not be in on.

15:07.860 --> 15:11.860
But right now, I'm going to enjoy the rest of this beautiful morning.

15:17.860 --> 15:32.860
Thanks for watching!
