1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,180
Okay, enough of that.

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,340
This is not going to be a cinematic vlog here.

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,340
I'm just showing you what I've been up to lately, and right now I need to get from London

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,820
to Las Vegas and back again in 72 hours.

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,180
This is guaranteed to be a jet lag disaster, but I have a plan.

6
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:42,740
My body is going to Vegas, but my sleep cycle is going to stay in London on GMT, gray master

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,740
time.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,100
I'm changing continents, but not changing time zones.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,580
I think this is a great idea, everyone I know thinks this is ridiculous, but I'm going to

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,580
give it a shot.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:01:09,080
Let's go.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,260
What the heck is that?

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,340
Planes wander around on the runway for a long time, so you always have to check and see

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,980
when is it going to be real.

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
It's real.

16
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,140
Okay, this is Future Gray here, editing this video, and who obviously survived the flight.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,160
I'm not normally worried about the actual plane, this is not where my travel anxieties

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,940
come from, but look at the wing of this plane as it takes off.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,380
It really bends quite a lot from the original position.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,900
Now I have flown a bunch, I don't remember ever seeing this kind of thing before, and

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,660
I found it extremely concerning.

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,700
Normally this is the exact moment where my travel anxieties end, and once the plane is

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,700
in the air I can just sit back and read or work or whatever and just feel like I have

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,660
a bunch of time on my own, but I couldn't help but keep looking at this wing and how

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,660
much it bent.

26
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Is this normal?

27
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,660
It doesn't seem normal.

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,820
Anyway, back to Past Gray, who's actually on the plane.

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,380
So the very vlog that I hope you're watching right now is something I'm thinking of trying

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,420
to do on this trip as like an additional thing, but I gotta tell you, this wing outside the

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,860
plane is extremely concerning, like it's not just me, right?

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
It's really bent.

33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,540
Okay, I've been working on the vlog for a little while, but if this plan is going to

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,420
work I need to get to sleep because there's only six and a half hours of flight time remaining.

35
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,940
It's noon o'clock in Las Vegas and eight o'clock in London, which is a little early, but I've

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,220
brought sleeping pills of unconsciousness.

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,340
They're blue, as all such pills are legally required to be.

38
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Oh god, it's really early.

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,940
Alright, I've gotta get up.

40
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
I'll make up some sleep at the hotel.

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Traveling into the U.S. sucks.

42
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
This is where I protect my phone.

43
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
This is where I protect myself.

44
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
Vegas, baby.

45
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Alright, it took me way longer to get through the airport than I was expecting.

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,860
It's almost four in the morning in London, but it's almost 8 p.m. in Las Vegas.

47
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,860
And I wanted to sleep a little bit when I got in, but I don't have time because I have

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,860
a dinner to get to at 8.30.

49
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Okay, future Grey here.

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,860
I did make it to the dinner on time, but I didn't film it, so here's some stock footage

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
of puppies instead.

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,860
And now that we're taking this little break, I'm going to let past Grey explain exactly

53
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
what the plan is in detail.

54
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,860
Let's take a look at London and let's take a look at Las Vegas.

55
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
1 a.m. in London is 5 p.m. in Las Vegas.

56
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,860
Drawing out the rest of the hours gets us this relationship between the times.

57
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Around 10 o'clock, I am definitely asleep, which expanding to 8 hours later gets us to

58
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,860
around 6 in the morning when I'm usually waking up.

59
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,860
This means in Las Vegas, I'm going to be asleep from about 2 in the afternoon until 10 p.m.

60
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,860
My 8 or 9 o'clock at night is still lunchtime for people in Las Vegas, so I'm definitely

61
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,860
available then.

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,860
But if I'm willing to take away 2 hours of sleep, I can actually make it for the time

63
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,860
when most people want to have dinner, which is 8 o'clock at night.

64
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Normally, that's my nightmare, having dinner at 8, but this time it's working in my favour.

65
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,860
Crazy normal people like to stay up until midnight, which I could never possibly do,

66
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
but now this is looking like a real possibility.

67
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
There, midnight is just my 8 in the morning, at which I've already been awake for 3 hours

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,860
anyway on London time.

69
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
So there's a big overlap during this section.

70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Even better, when they go to bed, it means I have the rest of a full working day essentially

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,860
on my own.

72
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,860
No one's going to be around at 4 a.m. in Las Vegas.

73
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
I can just be doing whatever I want.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
It's my lunchtime.

75
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Normal business hours start at 9 a.m., which is my 5 in the afternoon.

76
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,860
So as far as I'm concerned, this actually works perfectly.

77
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,860
I can see people in the beginning of the workday, I can meet people for their lunch,

78
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,860
I can be around for people's dinners, and I actually get to be the guy who can stay

79
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,860
up late for post-dinner socializing, a first in my life, and I get a whole chunk of time to myself.

80
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,860
I don't see how it could possibly go wrong.

81
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,860
The only thing I need to do is just make sure I don't fall asleep at the wrong time.

82
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Dinner over, which was my breakfast.

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm pretty tired, but it's 10.40 a.m. on Grey Master Time.

84
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,860
I can't fall asleep, so I'm going out for a walk to actually see Vegas for a little bit.

85
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,860
Vegas really is the city where I think this plan can work,

86
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,860
because if there's one place that doesn't want you to know what time it really is, it's Las Vegas.

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,860
The walk helped. Now it's time to take advantage of everybody being asleep.

88
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,860
But I need to find Bingo.

89
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Target acquired. Time to return to home base and edit an episode of Hello Internet as the sun rises.

90
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:59,860
It's a funny setup, but it worked.

91
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Alright, I'm getting pretty tired when I shouldn't be, so I'm just standing in the sun for a while to remind my brain to stay awake

92
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,860
before heading off to meet some people for breakfast and then lunch, but I didn't film that, so here's a sleepy hedgehog instead.

93
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Alright, it's 9.30 in London, even though it's only 1.30 in Las Vegas, and I am exhausted.

94
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,860
It's been a long day. I lost more sleep than I expected because of the flight and the time it took to get to the airport.

95
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,860
At least one day has been successfully accomplished, but now I am going to bed.

96
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Okay, this is the first time that I'm waking up actually according to the schedule.

97
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,860
So far, so good. I have a 9.30 dinner that I need to go catch, which is actually going to be my breakfast.

98
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
You know the drill.

99
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,860
People stayed up until way late this time.

100
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm never the guy who gets to close down a party because I'm Mr. In My Pajamas at 8 p.m.,

101
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,860
but now the tables have turned and I can be the last one who stays awake.

102
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I have the whole day ahead of me, but I'm skipping to the end because I don't want to spend my whole day filming things,

103
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,860
but I saw a big shoe, I saw some robots taking our jobs,

104
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,860
took a car, met some people for their lunch and my dinner,

105
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,860
and now I need to go to bed pretty quick because I need to wake up earlier to catch a final dinner here.

106
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,860
The first few minutes of waking up are not great normally,

107
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,860
but when you have to wake up just a little bit earlier, it makes a big difference.

108
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,860
But I know, just get into the shower and get going.

109
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,860
I was a little bit late and a little bit lost trying to find my way to dinner, but boy was it worth it.

110
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,860
My steak for dinner breakfast is over and this is my last morning in Las Vegas,

111
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
and there's something I want to do.

112
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
What is a vlog without a montage?

113
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,860
So I'm grabbing a car to the other end of the strip and I'm going to film my way back as the sun rises.

114
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Walk with me.

115
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,860
It's been a pretty great time in Vegas.

116
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,860
I spent the rest of the day just packing and getting ready to go, which is totally uninteresting,

117
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,860
and now I'm setting my alarm and a timer because I have to get up very early to catch the flight home.

118
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Future Grey here because Past Grey didn't have a whole lot of time between when he woke up,

119
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,860
when he had to get in the car, and when he had to get to the airport.

120
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,860
I wasn't close close, but it was a lot closer than I would normally cut these kind of things.

121
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,860
The flight was at Las Vegas 10pm time, which was London 6am time.

122
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,860
And this flight home turned out to be the hardest part of maintaining Grey master time.

123
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,860
This was a night flight back. All of the lights were turned off. I was in darkness the entire time.

124
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,860
The plane was in the air for what had been 7am for me, but I had already been up since about 3am

125
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,860
getting ready to go to the airport, and boy did I want to sleep.

126
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,860
To make matters worse, the power in my seat didn't work for the vast majority of the flight,

127
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,860
so I was just counting down the time I had left on my laptop to work to give me something productive to do

128
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,860
instead of just sitting there in the darkness trying not to fall asleep.

129
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,860
But thankfully the nice flight attendants kept bringing me many, many cups of coffee

130
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,860
and eventually got the power in the seat next to mine working so that I could keep doing stuff.

131
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,860
The sun did come up, which really helped, and then we flew above the clouds for quite a while

132
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:16,860
and 9 hours later descended through them into the ever bright and beautiful England.

133
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Then back through a much easier security, trains, and eventually home to a normal day where I could go to bed.

134
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,860
Where I was going to wake up the next morning to see if this test was successful.

135
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,860
Was I able to go to Las Vegas and come back without disrupting my regular sleep cycle?

136
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Woke up to a foggy London this morning.

137
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,860
I know people think the city always looks like this, but in my time living here, it rarely does.

138
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,860
So I always try to appreciate a good fog when it comes in.

139
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,860
I'm a little tired, which is to be expected given that I've cut at least 2 hours of sleep off each night for the past 3 days.

140
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:09,860
But the very fact that I am awake in London at this time in the morning after coming back from America...

141
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
It feels like a miracle.

142
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,860
Normally when I come back from America, I sleep in really late, I feel really terrible,

143
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,860
I'm just jet lagged, and I'm totally unproductive for a week.

144
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,860
But right now, the plan is to head into a cafe and work on one of the final drafts for the next video that's going up.

145
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,860
That's a huge relief that this trip didn't destroy a week's worth of productivity.

146
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,860
And I don't know if I'll do it, but I feel like it opens up the possibility of doing shorter trips to America in the future.

147
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
We'll see.

148
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,860
As for this vlog that you may or may not be watching, I don't know if I'm going to finish it.

149
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,860
I don't know if I do finish it if I'll put it up on the channel, and in particular, I don't know if I put it up on the channel if people will like it.

150
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:02,860
But for now, it's been at least an interesting, fun side project to have that's like a little bit of a secret.

151
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Which you, dear potential future viewer, may or may not be in on.

152
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,860
But right now, I'm going to enjoy the rest of this beautiful morning.

153
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Thanks for watching!
