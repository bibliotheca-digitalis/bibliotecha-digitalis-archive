0	20180	Okay, enough of that.
20180	22340	This is not going to be a cinematic vlog here.
22340	27340	I'm just showing you what I've been up to lately, and right now I need to get from London
27340	30820	to Las Vegas and back again in 72 hours.
30820	35180	This is guaranteed to be a jet lag disaster, but I have a plan.
35180	42740	My body is going to Vegas, but my sleep cycle is going to stay in London on GMT, gray master
42740	43740	time.
43740	47100	I'm changing continents, but not changing time zones.
47100	51580	I think this is a great idea, everyone I know thinks this is ridiculous, but I'm going to
51580	52580	give it a shot.
52580	69080	Let's go.
69080	71260	What the heck is that?
71260	76340	Planes wander around on the runway for a long time, so you always have to check and see
76340	77980	when is it going to be real.
77980	78980	It's real.
78980	83140	Okay, this is Future Gray here, editing this video, and who obviously survived the flight.
83140	87160	I'm not normally worried about the actual plane, this is not where my travel anxieties
87160	90940	come from, but look at the wing of this plane as it takes off.
90940	94380	It really bends quite a lot from the original position.
94380	98900	Now I have flown a bunch, I don't remember ever seeing this kind of thing before, and
98900	101660	I found it extremely concerning.
101660	105700	Normally this is the exact moment where my travel anxieties end, and once the plane is
105700	110700	in the air I can just sit back and read or work or whatever and just feel like I have
110700	115660	a bunch of time on my own, but I couldn't help but keep looking at this wing and how
115660	116660	much it bent.
116660	117660	Is this normal?
117660	118660	It doesn't seem normal.
118660	121820	Anyway, back to Past Gray, who's actually on the plane.
121820	125380	So the very vlog that I hope you're watching right now is something I'm thinking of trying
125380	130420	to do on this trip as like an additional thing, but I gotta tell you, this wing outside the
130420	133860	plane is extremely concerning, like it's not just me, right?
133860	134860	It's really bent.
135020	138540	Okay, I've been working on the vlog for a little while, but if this plan is going to
138540	143420	work I need to get to sleep because there's only six and a half hours of flight time remaining.
143420	147940	It's noon o'clock in Las Vegas and eight o'clock in London, which is a little early, but I've
147940	150220	brought sleeping pills of unconsciousness.
150220	153340	They're blue, as all such pills are legally required to be.
164940	166940	Oh god, it's really early.
175940	177940	Alright, I've gotta get up.
177940	179940	I'll make up some sleep at the hotel.
195860	197860	Traveling into the U.S. sucks.
197860	199860	This is where I protect my phone.
199860	201860	This is where I protect myself.
215860	217860	Vegas, baby.
217860	220860	Alright, it took me way longer to get through the airport than I was expecting.
220860	226860	It's almost four in the morning in London, but it's almost 8 p.m. in Las Vegas.
226860	230860	And I wanted to sleep a little bit when I got in, but I don't have time because I have
230860	233860	a dinner to get to at 8.30.
233860	234860	Okay, future Grey here.
234860	238860	I did make it to the dinner on time, but I didn't film it, so here's some stock footage
238860	240860	of puppies instead.
240860	243860	And now that we're taking this little break, I'm going to let past Grey explain exactly
243860	245860	what the plan is in detail.
245860	248860	Let's take a look at London and let's take a look at Las Vegas.
248860	250860	1 a.m. in London is 5 p.m. in Las Vegas.
250860	254860	Drawing out the rest of the hours gets us this relationship between the times.
254860	259860	Around 10 o'clock, I am definitely asleep, which expanding to 8 hours later gets us to
259860	262860	around 6 in the morning when I'm usually waking up.
262860	267860	This means in Las Vegas, I'm going to be asleep from about 2 in the afternoon until 10 p.m.
267860	273860	My 8 or 9 o'clock at night is still lunchtime for people in Las Vegas, so I'm definitely
273860	274860	available then.
274860	278860	But if I'm willing to take away 2 hours of sleep, I can actually make it for the time
278860	282860	when most people want to have dinner, which is 8 o'clock at night.
282860	287860	Normally, that's my nightmare, having dinner at 8, but this time it's working in my favour.
287860	292860	Crazy normal people like to stay up until midnight, which I could never possibly do,
292860	294860	but now this is looking like a real possibility.
294860	299860	There, midnight is just my 8 in the morning, at which I've already been awake for 3 hours
299860	301860	anyway on London time.
301860	303860	So there's a big overlap during this section.
303860	309860	Even better, when they go to bed, it means I have the rest of a full working day essentially
309860	310860	on my own.
310860	313860	No one's going to be around at 4 a.m. in Las Vegas.
313860	315860	I can just be doing whatever I want.
315860	316860	It's my lunchtime.
316860	320860	Normal business hours start at 9 a.m., which is my 5 in the afternoon.
320860	324860	So as far as I'm concerned, this actually works perfectly.
324860	328860	I can see people in the beginning of the workday, I can meet people for their lunch,
328860	332860	I can be around for people's dinners, and I actually get to be the guy who can stay
332860	338860	up late for post-dinner socializing, a first in my life, and I get a whole chunk of time to myself.
338860	340860	I don't see how it could possibly go wrong.
340860	345860	The only thing I need to do is just make sure I don't fall asleep at the wrong time.
345860	347860	Dinner over, which was my breakfast.
347860	352860	I'm pretty tired, but it's 10.40 a.m. on Grey Master Time.
352860	357860	I can't fall asleep, so I'm going out for a walk to actually see Vegas for a little bit.
357860	361860	Vegas really is the city where I think this plan can work,
361860	367860	because if there's one place that doesn't want you to know what time it really is, it's Las Vegas.
367860	372860	The walk helped. Now it's time to take advantage of everybody being asleep.
372860	375860	But I need to find Bingo.
375860	383860	Target acquired. Time to return to home base and edit an episode of Hello Internet as the sun rises.
391860	419860	It's a funny setup, but it worked.
419860	426860	Alright, I'm getting pretty tired when I shouldn't be, so I'm just standing in the sun for a while to remind my brain to stay awake
426860	433860	before heading off to meet some people for breakfast and then lunch, but I didn't film that, so here's a sleepy hedgehog instead.
433860	439860	Alright, it's 9.30 in London, even though it's only 1.30 in Las Vegas, and I am exhausted.
439860	445860	It's been a long day. I lost more sleep than I expected because of the flight and the time it took to get to the airport.
445860	450860	At least one day has been successfully accomplished, but now I am going to bed.
455860	459860	Okay, this is the first time that I'm waking up actually according to the schedule.
459860	465860	So far, so good. I have a 9.30 dinner that I need to go catch, which is actually going to be my breakfast.
465860	467860	You know the drill.
467860	470860	People stayed up until way late this time.
470860	476860	I'm never the guy who gets to close down a party because I'm Mr. In My Pajamas at 8 p.m.,
476860	481860	but now the tables have turned and I can be the last one who stays awake.
481860	486860	I have the whole day ahead of me, but I'm skipping to the end because I don't want to spend my whole day filming things,
486860	489860	but I saw a big shoe, I saw some robots taking our jobs,
492860	496860	took a car, met some people for their lunch and my dinner,
496860	501860	and now I need to go to bed pretty quick because I need to wake up earlier to catch a final dinner here.
503860	506860	The first few minutes of waking up are not great normally,
506860	510860	but when you have to wake up just a little bit earlier, it makes a big difference.
510860	514860	But I know, just get into the shower and get going.
515860	521860	I was a little bit late and a little bit lost trying to find my way to dinner, but boy was it worth it.
521860	526860	My steak for dinner breakfast is over and this is my last morning in Las Vegas,
526860	528860	and there's something I want to do.
528860	531860	What is a vlog without a montage?
531860	537860	So I'm grabbing a car to the other end of the strip and I'm going to film my way back as the sun rises.
537860	539860	Walk with me.
701860	708860	It's been a pretty great time in Vegas.
708860	712860	I spent the rest of the day just packing and getting ready to go, which is totally uninteresting,
712860	720860	and now I'm setting my alarm and a timer because I have to get up very early to catch the flight home.
720860	725860	Future Grey here because Past Grey didn't have a whole lot of time between when he woke up,
725860	729860	when he had to get in the car, and when he had to get to the airport.
729860	734860	I wasn't close close, but it was a lot closer than I would normally cut these kind of things.
734860	738860	The flight was at Las Vegas 10pm time, which was London 6am time.
738860	743860	And this flight home turned out to be the hardest part of maintaining Grey master time.
743860	750860	This was a night flight back. All of the lights were turned off. I was in darkness the entire time.
750860	755860	The plane was in the air for what had been 7am for me, but I had already been up since about 3am
755860	759860	getting ready to go to the airport, and boy did I want to sleep.
759860	764860	To make matters worse, the power in my seat didn't work for the vast majority of the flight,
764860	771860	so I was just counting down the time I had left on my laptop to work to give me something productive to do
771860	775860	instead of just sitting there in the darkness trying not to fall asleep.
775860	779860	But thankfully the nice flight attendants kept bringing me many, many cups of coffee
779860	785860	and eventually got the power in the seat next to mine working so that I could keep doing stuff.
785860	789860	The sun did come up, which really helped, and then we flew above the clouds for quite a while
789860	796860	and 9 hours later descended through them into the ever bright and beautiful England.
796860	803860	Then back through a much easier security, trains, and eventually home to a normal day where I could go to bed.
803860	808860	Where I was going to wake up the next morning to see if this test was successful.
808860	814860	Was I able to go to Las Vegas and come back without disrupting my regular sleep cycle?
821860	825860	Woke up to a foggy London this morning.
825860	832860	I know people think the city always looks like this, but in my time living here, it rarely does.
832860	835860	So I always try to appreciate a good fog when it comes in.
835860	842860	I'm a little tired, which is to be expected given that I've cut at least 2 hours of sleep off each night for the past 3 days.
842860	849860	But the very fact that I am awake in London at this time in the morning after coming back from America...
851860	853860	It feels like a miracle.
853860	858860	Normally when I come back from America, I sleep in really late, I feel really terrible,
858860	862860	I'm just jet lagged, and I'm totally unproductive for a week.
862860	868860	But right now, the plan is to head into a cafe and work on one of the final drafts for the next video that's going up.
868860	874860	That's a huge relief that this trip didn't destroy a week's worth of productivity.
874860	880860	And I don't know if I'll do it, but I feel like it opens up the possibility of doing shorter trips to America in the future.
880860	882860	We'll see.
882860	887860	As for this vlog that you may or may not be watching, I don't know if I'm going to finish it.
887860	895860	I don't know if I do finish it if I'll put it up on the channel, and in particular, I don't know if I put it up on the channel if people will like it.
895860	902860	But for now, it's been at least an interesting, fun side project to have that's like a little bit of a secret.
902860	907860	Which you, dear potential future viewer, may or may not be in on.
907860	911860	But right now, I'm going to enjoy the rest of this beautiful morning.
917860	932860	Thanks for watching!
