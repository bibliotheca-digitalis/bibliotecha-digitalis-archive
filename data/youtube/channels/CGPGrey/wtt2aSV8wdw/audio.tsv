0	7800	Hello internet! Enjoying your interneting session? Perhaps watching this video with lots of tabs open in the background, full of interesting things to check out?
7800	15900	The internet is amazing, and that's because of the rules which govern how it works, an important one of which is net neutrality, treating all data equally.
15900	25800	But some internet providers want to ditch this rule to insert themselves betwixt you and your data as the most meddlesome middlemen in human history, to their benefit and our detriment.
25800	33600	But how? Well, think of the internet as a series of pipes. Some are ocean and continent spanning pipes through which vast rivers of data flow.
33600	38100	You don't get access to those. They're very expensive and you couldn't handle it anyway.
38100	43100	But you do have a little pipe that connects to the big pipes through which you can pull down and send out data.
43100	49100	You pay your internet provider to maintain this pipe. This rule means that your little pipe cares not what flows through it.
49100	56100	Like cat videos, discussion forums, calls or games, whatever you're doing, you're using the whole pipe to do it and no website gets preference over another.
56100	63100	Everyone wants a faster internet, but that requires more metaphorical pipe in the ground, the building of which is slow and expensive.
63100	69100	Now, you may have heard your internet provider on the news talking about how this rule prevents them from building fast lanes for special kinds of data.
69100	77100	They want you to think they're expanding your access to the information superhighway, but removing this rule also gives them the power to speedbump the existing roads
77100	81100	and charge more to use the fast lane that was really just what you had before.
81100	87100	The power to preference some data over others is the power to favor one video site over another
87100	95100	and to limit a tiny part of the pipe for the video you're watching right now or trying to anyway.
95100	99100	We've been through this before, constraining other companies in similar ways.
99100	104100	Take electricity. You pay for a certain amount and when it arrives in your house, you can do with it what you wish.
104100	111100	The electricity company doesn't get to decide that rather than build more power plants, it's going to dim your bulbs and then offer a brighter bulbs monthly subscription.
111100	113100	And so it should go with the internet.
113100	116100	Watts are watts and bits are bits and we'll always need more and more.
116100	122100	And preserving this rule for the internet has much wider impact than just if some company takes more of your coins.
122100	127100	Not to be overly dramatic here, but preserving data equality may be one of the most important issues in a generation
127100	131100	because without this rule, internet providers could cripple competitors they don't like.
132100	138100	Ever notice the same company that sells you internet also sells cable TV and landlines, stuff the internet totally replaces?
138100	145100	Without data equality, your internet provider could narrow the pipe for competitors until they either go out of business, pay the meddlesome middleman or both.
145100	154100	It's like if one store in town super promised to pay for fast roads everywhere as long as the town gave them absolute power over all the roads forever, no backsies.
154100	162100	If you agree to that deal, don't be surprised when years later all the traffic to them is fast and free while the roads elsewhere are slow and neglected.
162100	170100	This town is basically the internet without net neutrality which some internet providers would love but actual internet citizens not so much.
170100	177100	Having the pipes treat all the data the same lets one guy with a good idea and a bit of programming knowledge make something today that's seen by millions tomorrow
177100	181100	but only because his data is treated equally with everything else in those pipes.
181100	185100	An internet that treats data equally is an internet that continues to shower us with wonder
185100	191100	but an internet where middlemen pick and choose what comes through the pipe is an internet of stagnation for all and profit for few.
191100	202100	Which is why some internet providers will always want that control so the cost of preserving our awesome internet is eternal vigilance on the part of good citizens to defend net neutrality.
211100	214100	you
