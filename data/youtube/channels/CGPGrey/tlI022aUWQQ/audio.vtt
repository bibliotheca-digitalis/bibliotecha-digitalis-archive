00:00.000 --> 00:01.560
What is Reddit?

00:01.560 --> 00:05.400
For much of the internet, Reddit is the gateway to everything interesting going on in the

00:05.400 --> 00:06.400
world.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.240
Checking reddit.com is like reading the daily newspaper, except that Reddit is timely, interactive,

00:10.240 --> 00:15.140
personalized, participatory, horrifyingly absorbing at times and basically good.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.880
The way it works is that people submit links to Reddit, blog posts or images or videos

00:18.880 --> 00:21.460
and other people vote those links up or down.

00:21.460 --> 00:25.400
It's a simple idea but it makes Reddit into a list of the best stuff that people are reading

00:25.400 --> 00:27.720
or watching on the internet right now.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.460
The name is a contraction of Reddit, as in I already read it on Reddit, which, if you

00:31.460 --> 00:35.720
spend significant time on the site, is what you'll say to everyone who tries to show you

00:35.720 --> 00:36.720
anything.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.200
It's a kind of awesome curse.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.240
Because there are no editors on Reddit, you never know what you're going to find, but

00:41.240 --> 00:45.840
you can bet it's going to be funny or interesting or enraging because thousands of other people

00:45.840 --> 00:48.440
have already voted that it's something to see.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
Think of it this way.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.860
If Google is where you go to search for things, then Reddit is where you go to see the things

00:52.860 --> 00:54.300
that people have found.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.520
But Reddit is not just one list of stuff.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.440
Reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections called subreddits.

00:59.440 --> 01:03.960
If you like just politics or programming or funny image captions or sports or world news,

01:03.960 --> 01:06.420
there are subreddits that list only that stuff.

01:06.420 --> 01:09.760
And there's going to be a subreddit for your city or country or region.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.620
Love a TV show that ended years ago?

01:11.620 --> 01:15.020
There's a subreddit where people are still talking about it as though it just aired.

01:15.020 --> 01:18.600
Tech geeks have their technology and flag geeks their vexillology and on the off chance

01:18.600 --> 01:22.200
you're interested in something that doesn't yet exist, just press a button and a new subreddit

01:22.200 --> 01:23.200
is born.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.000
Each subreddit works just like the main page, a constantly updating list of interesting

01:27.000 --> 01:29.460
stuff according to the people interested in that stuff.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.060
And when a subreddit grows large it can be terrifyingly good at this.

01:33.060 --> 01:38.220
For example, Awe, a section devoted to adorableness, is a global 24 hour a day battle to find the

01:38.220 --> 01:39.540
cutest images ever.

01:39.540 --> 01:43.540
Turns out, if you give people with baby animal photos a place to have their baby animal photos

01:43.540 --> 01:48.540
compete, the result is the highest density of cuteness human civilization has yet created.

01:48.540 --> 01:51.960
But without editors running the site, how does that sorting process work?

01:51.960 --> 01:54.660
There's no time to get into the code, but you can think of it like this.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.740
Links people submit are balloons floating up and down the list.

01:57.740 --> 02:01.420
When someone votes up a link it adds a bit of helium and a downvote sucks out a little

02:01.420 --> 02:02.420
bit of helium.

02:02.420 --> 02:05.660
Periodically, Reddit puts weights on all of the balloons, giving newer links that show

02:05.660 --> 02:09.380
up later a chance to compete against the ones that have been around longer.

02:09.380 --> 02:13.540
This method is shockingly good at sorting stuff, be it international politics or pictures

02:13.540 --> 02:14.540
of computer setups.

02:14.540 --> 02:18.660
Of course, when a website covers the whole of human endeavor, things get weird, like

02:18.660 --> 02:23.780
subreddits for only photos of birds, with arms, or only photos of Hitler, with socks.

02:23.780 --> 02:27.000
And then there are always the other kinds of photos that humans like to look at and

02:27.000 --> 02:31.080
sometimes collections of horrifying things that cannot be unseen.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.280
So yeah, this has taken a turn for the worse.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.720
But remember, Reddit can be weird, not because Reddit is weird, but because humans are weird.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.860
And the great thing about Reddit is that it changes to suit you.

02:40.860 --> 02:45.000
As you join subreddits you like and leave those you don't, the main page becomes yours,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.560
listing all the best stuff from all the subreddits you follow and leaving out stuff from the

02:48.560 --> 02:49.700
ones you don't.

02:49.700 --> 02:53.220
So Reddit is a lot like life, it is what you make it.

02:53.220 --> 02:56.820
But links are only the tip of the Redditberg, because people can discuss the links and this

02:56.820 --> 02:59.020
is where the true heart of Reddit lies.

02:59.020 --> 03:02.980
Most forums on the internet are hideous, but Reddit ain't your grandma's bulletin board.

03:02.980 --> 03:06.220
Just as that balloon sort method finds the best links, there's some math that's more

03:06.220 --> 03:09.780
complicated and less explainable that finds the most interesting comments in a discussion

03:09.780 --> 03:11.420
and brings them to the top.

03:11.420 --> 03:15.180
And Reddit displays comments in a way that encourages back and forth discussions, unlike

03:15.180 --> 03:17.080
some other comment systems.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.740
This sorting and threading means that a discussion of a link on Reddit is always more interesting

03:20.740 --> 03:22.060
than the link itself.

03:22.060 --> 03:25.940
So there are subreddits that are nothing but discussion, such as ChangeMyView for debates

03:25.940 --> 03:28.500
or Ask a Scientist where experts answer questions.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.580
Or there's IMA where people say what they are, I am a fireman or I am an escort or I

03:32.580 --> 03:35.420
am a prison guard, and answer questions from the comments.

03:35.420 --> 03:39.060
And because people on Reddit are anonymous, discussions are way more interesting and open

03:39.060 --> 03:41.580
than if people were forced to use their real names.

03:41.580 --> 03:45.800
Though with anonymity you'll find that not everyone's private thoughts exposed are beautiful

03:45.940 --> 03:49.940
and sometimes it can be uncomfortable to see what the faceless group thinks about a topic.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.460
But luckily Reddit has a way to deal with comments you think are unhelpful and despite

03:53.460 --> 03:58.100
people who act badly, it's clear that Reddit can only exist because the majority of people,

03:58.100 --> 04:00.140
even when anonymous, are good.

04:00.140 --> 04:04.480
But this anonymity isn't required, however, so you'll also find actors and authors, presidents

04:04.480 --> 04:07.840
and prime ministers all on Reddit answering questions from the community.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.440
And Reddit really is a community with its own culture and history that increasingly

04:11.440 --> 04:15.420
has an effect on the physical world with things like meeting up in person and raising money

04:16.040 --> 04:19.580
for charity and defending the internet and helping a family be with their sick child

04:19.580 --> 04:24.160
and holding the world's largest secret Santa and sending teachers the supplies they need.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.120
With its rapid-fire democracy and shockingly quick reactions, Reddit can sometimes make

04:28.120 --> 04:32.480
you feel more like a citizen of the internet than a citizen of your own country.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.480
But in the end, it's hard to understand Reddit without just jumping in and commenting

04:36.480 --> 04:38.600
and voting, which you really should.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.000
Once you get the hang of the place, you'll wonder how you ever internetted without it.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.420
Thanks for watching.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.420
I'll see you next time.

04:47.420 --> 04:47.420
