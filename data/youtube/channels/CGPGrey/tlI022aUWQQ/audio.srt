00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
What is Reddit?

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,400
For much of the internet, Reddit is the gateway to everything interesting going on in the

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
world.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,240
Checking reddit.com is like reading the daily newspaper, except that Reddit is timely, interactive,

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,140
personalized, participatory, horrifyingly absorbing at times and basically good.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,880
The way it works is that people submit links to Reddit, blog posts or images or videos

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,460
and other people vote those links up or down.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,400
It's a simple idea but it makes Reddit into a list of the best stuff that people are reading

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,720
or watching on the internet right now.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,460
The name is a contraction of Reddit, as in I already read it on Reddit, which, if you

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,720
spend significant time on the site, is what you'll say to everyone who tries to show you

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
anything.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,200
It's a kind of awesome curse.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,240
Because there are no editors on Reddit, you never know what you're going to find, but

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,840
you can bet it's going to be funny or interesting or enraging because thousands of other people

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
have already voted that it's something to see.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Think of it this way.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,860
If Google is where you go to search for things, then Reddit is where you go to see the things

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,300
that people have found.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,520
But Reddit is not just one list of stuff.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,440
Reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections called subreddits.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,960
If you like just politics or programming or funny image captions or sports or world news,

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,420
there are subreddits that list only that stuff.

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,760
And there's going to be a subreddit for your city or country or region.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,620
Love a TV show that ended years ago?

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,020
There's a subreddit where people are still talking about it as though it just aired.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,600
Tech geeks have their technology and flag geeks their vexillology and on the off chance

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,200
you're interested in something that doesn't yet exist, just press a button and a new subreddit

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
is born.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Each subreddit works just like the main page, a constantly updating list of interesting

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,460
stuff according to the people interested in that stuff.

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,060
And when a subreddit grows large it can be terrifyingly good at this.

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,220
For example, Awe, a section devoted to adorableness, is a global 24 hour a day battle to find the

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,540
cutest images ever.

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,540
Turns out, if you give people with baby animal photos a place to have their baby animal photos

36
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,540
compete, the result is the highest density of cuteness human civilization has yet created.

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,960
But without editors running the site, how does that sorting process work?

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,660
There's no time to get into the code, but you can think of it like this.

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,740
Links people submit are balloons floating up and down the list.

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,420
When someone votes up a link it adds a bit of helium and a downvote sucks out a little

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
bit of helium.

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,660
Periodically, Reddit puts weights on all of the balloons, giving newer links that show

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,380
up later a chance to compete against the ones that have been around longer.

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,540
This method is shockingly good at sorting stuff, be it international politics or pictures

45
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
of computer setups.

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,660
Of course, when a website covers the whole of human endeavor, things get weird, like

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,780
subreddits for only photos of birds, with arms, or only photos of Hitler, with socks.

48
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,000
And then there are always the other kinds of photos that humans like to look at and

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,080
sometimes collections of horrifying things that cannot be unseen.

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,280
So yeah, this has taken a turn for the worse.

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,720
But remember, Reddit can be weird, not because Reddit is weird, but because humans are weird.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,860
And the great thing about Reddit is that it changes to suit you.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,000
As you join subreddits you like and leave those you don't, the main page becomes yours,

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,560
listing all the best stuff from all the subreddits you follow and leaving out stuff from the

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,700
ones you don't.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,220
So Reddit is a lot like life, it is what you make it.

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,820
But links are only the tip of the Redditberg, because people can discuss the links and this

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,020
is where the true heart of Reddit lies.

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,980
Most forums on the internet are hideous, but Reddit ain't your grandma's bulletin board.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,220
Just as that balloon sort method finds the best links, there's some math that's more

61
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,780
complicated and less explainable that finds the most interesting comments in a discussion

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,420
and brings them to the top.

63
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,180
And Reddit displays comments in a way that encourages back and forth discussions, unlike

64
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,080
some other comment systems.

65
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,740
This sorting and threading means that a discussion of a link on Reddit is always more interesting

66
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,060
than the link itself.

67
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,940
So there are subreddits that are nothing but discussion, such as ChangeMyView for debates

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,500
or Ask a Scientist where experts answer questions.

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,580
Or there's IMA where people say what they are, I am a fireman or I am an escort or I

70
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,420
am a prison guard, and answer questions from the comments.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,060
And because people on Reddit are anonymous, discussions are way more interesting and open

72
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,580
than if people were forced to use their real names.

73
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,800
Though with anonymity you'll find that not everyone's private thoughts exposed are beautiful

74
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,940
and sometimes it can be uncomfortable to see what the faceless group thinks about a topic.

75
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,460
But luckily Reddit has a way to deal with comments you think are unhelpful and despite

76
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,100
people who act badly, it's clear that Reddit can only exist because the majority of people,

77
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,140
even when anonymous, are good.

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,480
But this anonymity isn't required, however, so you'll also find actors and authors, presidents

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
and prime ministers all on Reddit answering questions from the community.

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,440
And Reddit really is a community with its own culture and history that increasingly

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,420
has an effect on the physical world with things like meeting up in person and raising money

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,580
for charity and defending the internet and helping a family be with their sick child

83
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,160
and holding the world's largest secret Santa and sending teachers the supplies they need.

84
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,120
With its rapid-fire democracy and shockingly quick reactions, Reddit can sometimes make

85
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,480
you feel more like a citizen of the internet than a citizen of your own country.

86
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,480
But in the end, it's hard to understand Reddit without just jumping in and commenting

87
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,600
and voting, which you really should.

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,000
Once you get the hang of the place, you'll wonder how you ever internetted without it.

89
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Thanks for watching.

90
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
I'll see you next time.

91
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,420
