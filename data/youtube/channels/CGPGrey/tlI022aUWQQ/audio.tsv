0	1560	What is Reddit?
1560	5400	For much of the internet, Reddit is the gateway to everything interesting going on in the
5400	6400	world.
6400	10240	Checking reddit.com is like reading the daily newspaper, except that Reddit is timely, interactive,
10240	15140	personalized, participatory, horrifyingly absorbing at times and basically good.
15140	18880	The way it works is that people submit links to Reddit, blog posts or images or videos
18880	21460	and other people vote those links up or down.
21460	25400	It's a simple idea but it makes Reddit into a list of the best stuff that people are reading
25400	27720	or watching on the internet right now.
27720	31460	The name is a contraction of Reddit, as in I already read it on Reddit, which, if you
31460	35720	spend significant time on the site, is what you'll say to everyone who tries to show you
35720	36720	anything.
36720	38200	It's a kind of awesome curse.
38200	41240	Because there are no editors on Reddit, you never know what you're going to find, but
41240	45840	you can bet it's going to be funny or interesting or enraging because thousands of other people
45840	48440	have already voted that it's something to see.
48440	49440	Think of it this way.
49440	52860	If Google is where you go to search for things, then Reddit is where you go to see the things
52860	54300	that people have found.
54300	56520	But Reddit is not just one list of stuff.
56520	59440	Reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections called subreddits.
59440	63960	If you like just politics or programming or funny image captions or sports or world news,
63960	66420	there are subreddits that list only that stuff.
66420	69760	And there's going to be a subreddit for your city or country or region.
69760	71620	Love a TV show that ended years ago?
71620	75020	There's a subreddit where people are still talking about it as though it just aired.
75020	78600	Tech geeks have their technology and flag geeks their vexillology and on the off chance
78600	82200	you're interested in something that doesn't yet exist, just press a button and a new subreddit
82200	83200	is born.
83200	87000	Each subreddit works just like the main page, a constantly updating list of interesting
87000	89460	stuff according to the people interested in that stuff.
89460	93060	And when a subreddit grows large it can be terrifyingly good at this.
93060	98220	For example, Awe, a section devoted to adorableness, is a global 24 hour a day battle to find the
98220	99540	cutest images ever.
99540	103540	Turns out, if you give people with baby animal photos a place to have their baby animal photos
103540	108540	compete, the result is the highest density of cuteness human civilization has yet created.
108540	111960	But without editors running the site, how does that sorting process work?
111960	114660	There's no time to get into the code, but you can think of it like this.
114660	117740	Links people submit are balloons floating up and down the list.
117740	121420	When someone votes up a link it adds a bit of helium and a downvote sucks out a little
121420	122420	bit of helium.
122420	125660	Periodically, Reddit puts weights on all of the balloons, giving newer links that show
125660	129380	up later a chance to compete against the ones that have been around longer.
129380	133540	This method is shockingly good at sorting stuff, be it international politics or pictures
133540	134540	of computer setups.
134540	138660	Of course, when a website covers the whole of human endeavor, things get weird, like
138660	143780	subreddits for only photos of birds, with arms, or only photos of Hitler, with socks.
143780	147000	And then there are always the other kinds of photos that humans like to look at and
147000	151080	sometimes collections of horrifying things that cannot be unseen.
151080	153280	So yeah, this has taken a turn for the worse.
153280	157720	But remember, Reddit can be weird, not because Reddit is weird, but because humans are weird.
157720	160860	And the great thing about Reddit is that it changes to suit you.
160860	165000	As you join subreddits you like and leave those you don't, the main page becomes yours,
165000	168560	listing all the best stuff from all the subreddits you follow and leaving out stuff from the
168560	169700	ones you don't.
169700	173220	So Reddit is a lot like life, it is what you make it.
173220	176820	But links are only the tip of the Redditberg, because people can discuss the links and this
176820	179020	is where the true heart of Reddit lies.
179020	182980	Most forums on the internet are hideous, but Reddit ain't your grandma's bulletin board.
182980	186220	Just as that balloon sort method finds the best links, there's some math that's more
186220	189780	complicated and less explainable that finds the most interesting comments in a discussion
189780	191420	and brings them to the top.
191420	195180	And Reddit displays comments in a way that encourages back and forth discussions, unlike
195180	197080	some other comment systems.
197100	200740	This sorting and threading means that a discussion of a link on Reddit is always more interesting
200740	202060	than the link itself.
202060	205940	So there are subreddits that are nothing but discussion, such as ChangeMyView for debates
205940	208500	or Ask a Scientist where experts answer questions.
208500	212580	Or there's IMA where people say what they are, I am a fireman or I am an escort or I
212580	215420	am a prison guard, and answer questions from the comments.
215420	219060	And because people on Reddit are anonymous, discussions are way more interesting and open
219060	221580	than if people were forced to use their real names.
221580	225800	Though with anonymity you'll find that not everyone's private thoughts exposed are beautiful
225940	229940	and sometimes it can be uncomfortable to see what the faceless group thinks about a topic.
229940	233460	But luckily Reddit has a way to deal with comments you think are unhelpful and despite
233460	238100	people who act badly, it's clear that Reddit can only exist because the majority of people,
238100	240140	even when anonymous, are good.
240140	244480	But this anonymity isn't required, however, so you'll also find actors and authors, presidents
244480	247840	and prime ministers all on Reddit answering questions from the community.
247840	251440	And Reddit really is a community with its own culture and history that increasingly
251440	255420	has an effect on the physical world with things like meeting up in person and raising money
256040	259580	for charity and defending the internet and helping a family be with their sick child
259580	264160	and holding the world's largest secret Santa and sending teachers the supplies they need.
264160	268120	With its rapid-fire democracy and shockingly quick reactions, Reddit can sometimes make
268120	272480	you feel more like a citizen of the internet than a citizen of your own country.
272480	276480	But in the end, it's hard to understand Reddit without just jumping in and commenting
276480	278600	and voting, which you really should.
278600	282000	Once you get the hang of the place, you'll wonder how you ever internetted without it.
285420	286420	Thanks for watching.
286420	287420	I'll see you next time.
