0	4660	Once upon a time, a dragon tyrannized the kingdom.
4660	12700	Covered with thick black scales, its eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed evil-smelling slime.
12700	14780	Some tried to fight the dragon.
14780	18460	Priests and magicians called down curses to no avail.
18460	23660	Warriors armed with the best weapons attacked, only to be incinerated.
23660	31780	The dragon's claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armor so hard, as to make it invincible.
31780	35220	The dragon demanded from humankind a tribute.
35220	42620	Ten thousand men and women randomly chosen to be delivered every evening to the foot of the mountain to be eaten.
42620	48940	The king and the kingdom, their weapons useless, had no choice but to pay the grisly tribute,
48940	53180	to suffer the misery, to feed the insatiable hunger.
53180	60100	And humans, ever adaptable, came to accept the dragon tyrant as a fact of life,
60100	66100	knowing, even embracing, that everyone's final moments would be in its maw.
66100	68820	How could the world be otherwise?
68820	73820	The kingdom began to teach its children that the dragon had its place in the natural order,
73820	79540	and the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon's stomach.
79580	83660	Their shorter lives motivating them to lead good lives.
83660	90100	And the dragon was helping the kingdom by keeping the population from growing too fast.
90100	93820	Learning this, attacks on the dragon ceased.
93820	96900	But the kingdom still grew, slowly.
96900	105900	And with it, so did the dragon, becoming as big as the mountain on which it lived, its appetite increasing.
105900	111100	The logistics of collecting and transporting so many every day to the mountain
111100	116500	came to occupy the king's mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself.
116500	120660	The king had to hire registrars to keep track of who would be sent.
120660	124540	There were people collectors dispatched to fetch the designated victims,
124540	129020	there were clerks who administered the pensions to be paid to decimated families,
129020	133540	and there were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon,
133540	136420	trying to ease the anguish.
136420	142780	And there were dragonologists who studied how these logistic processes could be made more efficient.
142780	148540	Steam engines were invented and a railway constructed leading to the dragon's abode.
148540	154140	Trains arrived at the mountain terminal crammed with people and returned empty.
154140	159380	Some dragonologists also studied the dragon's behavior and collected samples.
159420	164860	Its shed scales, the slime, the excrement speckled with fragments of human bone.
164860	170620	The more the beast was understood, the more its invincibility confirmed.
170620	174420	But humanity is a curious species.
174420	178180	Every once in a while, someone gets a good idea.
178180	182220	Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements.
182220	186260	Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed.
186260	190460	Some of these tools make it easier to generate new ideas.
190460	195940	Thus, the great wheel of invention, which in the older ages turned imperceptibly slow,
195940	201340	began to accelerate and humans did what would have seemed magic before,
201340	204460	communicating instantly across great distance,
204460	209620	building machines that could fly and many other astonishing things.
209620	213780	A few dragonologists argued it might be time for a new attack.
213780	219020	One had invented a material so sharp it could pierce a dragon's scale.
219020	224220	It would not be easy, but if a huge projectile could be made out of this material
224220	227380	and launched with sufficient force and sufficient precision,
227380	231020	it might penetrate the dragon's armor.
231020	237340	However, it would be difficult and expensive and time-consuming to do.
237340	241460	The dragonologists explained their proposal to anyone who would listen.
241460	243220	But the people were skeptical.
243220	245980	They had been taught the dragon tyrant was invincible
245980	249540	and the sacrifices it demanded a fact of life.
249540	254060	Yet when they learnt about the new material and the idea for a projectile,
254060	256500	many became intrigued.
256500	260980	When the king read about the plans, he decided to hold an open hearing.
260980	267500	It took place on the last and darkest day of the year in the largest hall of the royal castle.
267500	271540	People packed into every last seat and crowded the aisles.
271580	278780	The king's advisor spoke first, telling the people it was best they accept the inevitability of the dragon.
278780	285540	And the dragon administration department provided many jobs that would be lost were the dragon slaughtered.
285540	291700	And in any case, the kingdom's coffers were empty after building the new railway.
291700	296300	Next, the leading dragonologist explained how the proposed device would work,
296300	300660	how the requisite amount of new invented material could be manufactured.
300660	306980	Given the requested amount of funding, it may be possible to complete the work in 15 to 20 years,
306980	309700	with greater funding, maybe 12.
309700	313060	However, there could be no guarantee.
313060	317500	Last to speak was the king's advisor for morality.
317500	319660	Let us grant, he said.
319660	325340	The project is technologically possible, though it hasn't been proven to me.
325340	329900	Presumably, you think you've got the right not to be chewed up.
329900	334980	How willful. How presumptuous. How vain.
334980	337980	The shortness of human life is a blessing.
337980	344580	Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our dignity.
344580	350980	This preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realizing more fully the aspirations
350980	357580	to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive.
357580	366220	The nature of the dragon is to eat, and our own nature, my friends, is nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten.
366220	370700	The dragon is necessary. The dragon is good.
370700	373060	The great hall was silent.
373060	376380	Then a small child yelled out from the audience,
376380	378180	The dragon is bad.
378180	382540	The child's parents turned red and hushed, but the child said again,
382540	387220	The dragon is bad. It kills people. It ate my granny.
387220	389060	I want my granny back.
389060	391300	The hall was silent again.
391300	392700	Then a woman stood.
392700	394820	The dragon killed my parents.
394820	396500	A man followed and stood.
396500	399620	The dragon killed my wife and my daughter.
399620	402060	More and more people stood.
402060	405780	The simple fact that the dragon killed everyone.
405780	410420	The loss of it. The weight of it crashing over the hall.
410420	415300	The way out from under, remote, yet maybe possible.
415300	419220	The king, looking at the first child to speak, announced,
419220	422100	Let us kill the dragon.
422100	427220	The next morning, a billion people woke to realize they or those they loved
427220	431340	might be sent to the dragon before the projectile launched.
431340	435900	Whereas before, active support for the anti-dragon cause had been limited,
435900	441020	it now became the number one priority and concern on everyone's mind.
441020	446300	Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase support,
446300	452460	which he did, passing extra appropriations bills and selling his summer castle, announcing,
452460	458980	I believe that this kingdom should commit itself to achieving the goal before the decade is out
458980	462700	of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon.
462700	466300	Thus started a great technological race against time.
466300	471340	To make the dragon-killing weapon required solutions to a thousand technical problems,
471340	476420	each of which required dozens of time-consuming steps and missteps.
476420	481540	Test missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction.
481540	487980	Terrible accidents happened, but there was now a seriousness of purpose and the work continued.
487980	492420	But despite almost unlimited funding and round-the-clock work by technicians,
492420	495300	the king's deadline could not be met.
495300	497300	The task was hard.
497300	502500	The decade concluded and the dragon still lived, still ate.
502500	504780	But the effort was getting closer.
504780	508580	A year later, the first prototype missile successfully launched.
508580	515220	The construction of the final projectile eventually set to complete and launch on New Year's Eve,
515220	519140	12 years after the project's inauguration.
519140	525220	The last day of the year was cold and overcast, but still and clear.
525220	527140	Good launch conditions.
527140	533140	As the sun set, technicians scuttled around, making the final adjustments and checks.
533140	537980	The king and his advisors observed from a platform close to the launch pad.
537980	542900	Further away, behind a fence, the public assembled to witness the great event.
542900	545180	A large clock counted down.
545180	547020	Ten minutes to go.
547020	551140	The dark, slumped profile of the dragon beyond, eating.
551140	556060	From the crowd, someone jumped the fence and ran to the platform where the king sat.
556060	560260	He arrived, accompanied by security, in a frenzied state, his nose bleeding.
560260	561060	He shouted,
561060	562580	The last train!
562580	565060	Stop the last train!
565060	568860	The young man was a junior clerk in the Ministry of Transportation.
568860	573220	He had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain.
573220	577460	The king had ordered the trains to continue to the very end,
577460	582860	fearing any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and the missile to miss.
582860	588660	The young man begged the king to issue a recall order for the last train due to arrive at
588660	592340	the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.
592340	594780	I cannot do it, said the king.
594780	598620	I cannot take the risk it will alert the dragon.
598620	601540	The clouds above their head let loose the rain.
601540	605380	I am so sorry, the king continued.
605380	610780	Had we started but one day earlier, your father would not have to die.
610780	618140	Looking at the crowd, thinking of all the losses that they, and he, had endured.
618140	622980	This project should have been started years earlier than we did.
622980	629640	So many need not have been killed by the dragon, had we but awoken from our acceptance of its
629640	631500	horror sooner.
631500	633540	The young man's wailing ceased.
633540	636500	The king looked up at the countdown clock.
636500	643900	Five seconds remaining, four, three, two, one, zero.
643900	648540	A ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out.
648540	655140	The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, that white flame shooting
655140	660540	into the dark embodied the human spirit, its fear and its hope.
660540	663220	That struck the heart of evil.
663220	666580	The silhouette on the horizon tumbled and fell.
666580	673000	Thousands of voices of joy rose from the masses, joined seconds later by a deafening, drawn
673000	676220	out thud from the collapsing monster.
676220	681300	After all this time, humanity was at last free from the dragon.
681300	684940	The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant.
684940	688100	Long live the king, long live us all.
688100	693640	The royal entourage, huddling in the downpour, accumulated around their monarch.
693640	696500	So much had changed in the last hour.
696500	703940	The right to an open future had been regained, a primordial fear abolished and many long-held
703940	706180	assumptions overturned.
706180	708520	What do we do now, they asked.
708520	713640	We have come a long way, said the king, yet now we are like children again.
713640	716380	The future lies open before us.
716380	722860	We shall go and try to do better than we have done in the past, for we have time now.
722860	728900	Time to get things right, time to grow up, time to learn from our mistakes.
728900	734540	Let all the bells in the kingdom ring until midnight in remembrance of our dead, then
734540	741260	after we will celebrate and begin the process of building a better world, for we have time
741260	741260	
746380	761300	now.
