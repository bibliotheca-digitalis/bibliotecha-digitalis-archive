00:00.000 --> 00:04.660
Once upon a time, a dragon tyrannized the kingdom.

00:04.660 --> 00:12.700
Covered with thick black scales, its eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed evil-smelling slime.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.780
Some tried to fight the dragon.

00:14.780 --> 00:18.460
Priests and magicians called down curses to no avail.

00:18.460 --> 00:23.660
Warriors armed with the best weapons attacked, only to be incinerated.

00:23.660 --> 00:31.780
The dragon's claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armor so hard, as to make it invincible.

00:31.780 --> 00:35.220
The dragon demanded from humankind a tribute.

00:35.220 --> 00:42.620
Ten thousand men and women randomly chosen to be delivered every evening to the foot of the mountain to be eaten.

00:42.620 --> 00:48.940
The king and the kingdom, their weapons useless, had no choice but to pay the grisly tribute,

00:48.940 --> 00:53.180
to suffer the misery, to feed the insatiable hunger.

00:53.180 --> 01:00.100
And humans, ever adaptable, came to accept the dragon tyrant as a fact of life,

01:00.100 --> 01:06.100
knowing, even embracing, that everyone's final moments would be in its maw.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.820
How could the world be otherwise?

01:08.820 --> 01:13.820
The kingdom began to teach its children that the dragon had its place in the natural order,

01:13.820 --> 01:19.540
and the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon's stomach.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.660
Their shorter lives motivating them to lead good lives.

01:23.660 --> 01:30.100
And the dragon was helping the kingdom by keeping the population from growing too fast.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.820
Learning this, attacks on the dragon ceased.

01:33.820 --> 01:36.900
But the kingdom still grew, slowly.

01:36.900 --> 01:45.900
And with it, so did the dragon, becoming as big as the mountain on which it lived, its appetite increasing.

01:45.900 --> 01:51.100
The logistics of collecting and transporting so many every day to the mountain

01:51.100 --> 01:56.500
came to occupy the king's mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.660
The king had to hire registrars to keep track of who would be sent.

02:00.660 --> 02:04.540
There were people collectors dispatched to fetch the designated victims,

02:04.540 --> 02:09.020
there were clerks who administered the pensions to be paid to decimated families,

02:09.020 --> 02:13.540
and there were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon,

02:13.540 --> 02:16.420
trying to ease the anguish.

02:16.420 --> 02:22.780
And there were dragonologists who studied how these logistic processes could be made more efficient.

02:22.780 --> 02:28.540
Steam engines were invented and a railway constructed leading to the dragon's abode.

02:28.540 --> 02:34.140
Trains arrived at the mountain terminal crammed with people and returned empty.

02:34.140 --> 02:39.380
Some dragonologists also studied the dragon's behavior and collected samples.

02:39.420 --> 02:44.860
Its shed scales, the slime, the excrement speckled with fragments of human bone.

02:44.860 --> 02:50.620
The more the beast was understood, the more its invincibility confirmed.

02:50.620 --> 02:54.420
But humanity is a curious species.

02:54.420 --> 02:58.180
Every once in a while, someone gets a good idea.

02:58.180 --> 03:02.220
Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements.

03:02.220 --> 03:06.260
Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed.

03:06.260 --> 03:10.460
Some of these tools make it easier to generate new ideas.

03:10.460 --> 03:15.940
Thus, the great wheel of invention, which in the older ages turned imperceptibly slow,

03:15.940 --> 03:21.340
began to accelerate and humans did what would have seemed magic before,

03:21.340 --> 03:24.460
communicating instantly across great distance,

03:24.460 --> 03:29.620
building machines that could fly and many other astonishing things.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.780
A few dragonologists argued it might be time for a new attack.

03:33.780 --> 03:39.020
One had invented a material so sharp it could pierce a dragon's scale.

03:39.020 --> 03:44.220
It would not be easy, but if a huge projectile could be made out of this material

03:44.220 --> 03:47.380
and launched with sufficient force and sufficient precision,

03:47.380 --> 03:51.020
it might penetrate the dragon's armor.

03:51.020 --> 03:57.340
However, it would be difficult and expensive and time-consuming to do.

03:57.340 --> 04:01.460
The dragonologists explained their proposal to anyone who would listen.

04:01.460 --> 04:03.220
But the people were skeptical.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.980
They had been taught the dragon tyrant was invincible

04:05.980 --> 04:09.540
and the sacrifices it demanded a fact of life.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.060
Yet when they learnt about the new material and the idea for a projectile,

04:14.060 --> 04:16.500
many became intrigued.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.980
When the king read about the plans, he decided to hold an open hearing.

04:20.980 --> 04:27.500
It took place on the last and darkest day of the year in the largest hall of the royal castle.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.540
People packed into every last seat and crowded the aisles.

04:31.580 --> 04:38.780
The king's advisor spoke first, telling the people it was best they accept the inevitability of the dragon.

04:38.780 --> 04:45.540
And the dragon administration department provided many jobs that would be lost were the dragon slaughtered.

04:45.540 --> 04:51.700
And in any case, the kingdom's coffers were empty after building the new railway.

04:51.700 --> 04:56.300
Next, the leading dragonologist explained how the proposed device would work,

04:56.300 --> 05:00.660
how the requisite amount of new invented material could be manufactured.

05:00.660 --> 05:06.980
Given the requested amount of funding, it may be possible to complete the work in 15 to 20 years,

05:06.980 --> 05:09.700
with greater funding, maybe 12.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.060
However, there could be no guarantee.

05:13.060 --> 05:17.500
Last to speak was the king's advisor for morality.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.660
Let us grant, he said.

05:19.660 --> 05:25.340
The project is technologically possible, though it hasn't been proven to me.

05:25.340 --> 05:29.900
Presumably, you think you've got the right not to be chewed up.

05:29.900 --> 05:34.980
How willful. How presumptuous. How vain.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.980
The shortness of human life is a blessing.

05:37.980 --> 05:44.580
Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our dignity.

05:44.580 --> 05:50.980
This preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realizing more fully the aspirations

05:50.980 --> 05:57.580
to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive.

05:57.580 --> 06:06.220
The nature of the dragon is to eat, and our own nature, my friends, is nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten.

06:06.220 --> 06:10.700
The dragon is necessary. The dragon is good.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.060
The great hall was silent.

06:13.060 --> 06:16.380
Then a small child yelled out from the audience,

06:16.380 --> 06:18.180
The dragon is bad.

06:18.180 --> 06:22.540
The child's parents turned red and hushed, but the child said again,

06:22.540 --> 06:27.220
The dragon is bad. It kills people. It ate my granny.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.060
I want my granny back.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.300
The hall was silent again.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.700
Then a woman stood.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.820
The dragon killed my parents.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.500
A man followed and stood.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.620
The dragon killed my wife and my daughter.

06:39.620 --> 06:42.060
More and more people stood.

06:42.060 --> 06:45.780
The simple fact that the dragon killed everyone.

06:45.780 --> 06:50.420
The loss of it. The weight of it crashing over the hall.

06:50.420 --> 06:55.300
The way out from under, remote, yet maybe possible.

06:55.300 --> 06:59.220
The king, looking at the first child to speak, announced,

06:59.220 --> 07:02.100
Let us kill the dragon.

07:02.100 --> 07:07.220
The next morning, a billion people woke to realize they or those they loved

07:07.220 --> 07:11.340
might be sent to the dragon before the projectile launched.

07:11.340 --> 07:15.900
Whereas before, active support for the anti-dragon cause had been limited,

07:15.900 --> 07:21.020
it now became the number one priority and concern on everyone's mind.

07:21.020 --> 07:26.300
Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase support,

07:26.300 --> 07:32.460
which he did, passing extra appropriations bills and selling his summer castle, announcing,

07:32.460 --> 07:38.980
I believe that this kingdom should commit itself to achieving the goal before the decade is out

07:38.980 --> 07:42.700
of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.300
Thus started a great technological race against time.

07:46.300 --> 07:51.340
To make the dragon-killing weapon required solutions to a thousand technical problems,

07:51.340 --> 07:56.420
each of which required dozens of time-consuming steps and missteps.

07:56.420 --> 08:01.540
Test missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction.

08:01.540 --> 08:07.980
Terrible accidents happened, but there was now a seriousness of purpose and the work continued.

08:07.980 --> 08:12.420
But despite almost unlimited funding and round-the-clock work by technicians,

08:12.420 --> 08:15.300
the king's deadline could not be met.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.300
The task was hard.

08:17.300 --> 08:22.500
The decade concluded and the dragon still lived, still ate.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.780
But the effort was getting closer.

08:24.780 --> 08:28.580
A year later, the first prototype missile successfully launched.

08:28.580 --> 08:35.220
The construction of the final projectile eventually set to complete and launch on New Year's Eve,

08:35.220 --> 08:39.140
12 years after the project's inauguration.

08:39.140 --> 08:45.220
The last day of the year was cold and overcast, but still and clear.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.140
Good launch conditions.

08:47.140 --> 08:53.140
As the sun set, technicians scuttled around, making the final adjustments and checks.

08:53.140 --> 08:57.980
The king and his advisors observed from a platform close to the launch pad.

08:57.980 --> 09:02.900
Further away, behind a fence, the public assembled to witness the great event.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.180
A large clock counted down.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.020
Ten minutes to go.

09:07.020 --> 09:11.140
The dark, slumped profile of the dragon beyond, eating.

09:11.140 --> 09:16.060
From the crowd, someone jumped the fence and ran to the platform where the king sat.

09:16.060 --> 09:20.260
He arrived, accompanied by security, in a frenzied state, his nose bleeding.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.060
He shouted,

09:21.060 --> 09:22.580
The last train!

09:22.580 --> 09:25.060
Stop the last train!

09:25.060 --> 09:28.860
The young man was a junior clerk in the Ministry of Transportation.

09:28.860 --> 09:33.220
He had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain.

09:33.220 --> 09:37.460
The king had ordered the trains to continue to the very end,

09:37.460 --> 09:42.860
fearing any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and the missile to miss.

09:42.860 --> 09:48.660
The young man begged the king to issue a recall order for the last train due to arrive at

09:48.660 --> 09:52.340
the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.780
I cannot do it, said the king.

09:54.780 --> 09:58.620
I cannot take the risk it will alert the dragon.

09:58.620 --> 10:01.540
The clouds above their head let loose the rain.

10:01.540 --> 10:05.380
I am so sorry, the king continued.

10:05.380 --> 10:10.780
Had we started but one day earlier, your father would not have to die.

10:10.780 --> 10:18.140
Looking at the crowd, thinking of all the losses that they, and he, had endured.

10:18.140 --> 10:22.980
This project should have been started years earlier than we did.

10:22.980 --> 10:29.640
So many need not have been killed by the dragon, had we but awoken from our acceptance of its

10:29.640 --> 10:31.500
horror sooner.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.540
The young man's wailing ceased.

10:33.540 --> 10:36.500
The king looked up at the countdown clock.

10:36.500 --> 10:43.900
Five seconds remaining, four, three, two, one, zero.

10:43.900 --> 10:48.540
A ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out.

10:48.540 --> 10:55.140
The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, that white flame shooting

10:55.140 --> 11:00.540
into the dark embodied the human spirit, its fear and its hope.

11:00.540 --> 11:03.220
That struck the heart of evil.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.580
The silhouette on the horizon tumbled and fell.

11:06.580 --> 11:13.000
Thousands of voices of joy rose from the masses, joined seconds later by a deafening, drawn

11:13.000 --> 11:16.220
out thud from the collapsing monster.

11:16.220 --> 11:21.300
After all this time, humanity was at last free from the dragon.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.940
The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant.

11:24.940 --> 11:28.100
Long live the king, long live us all.

11:28.100 --> 11:33.640
The royal entourage, huddling in the downpour, accumulated around their monarch.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.500
So much had changed in the last hour.

11:36.500 --> 11:43.940
The right to an open future had been regained, a primordial fear abolished and many long-held

11:43.940 --> 11:46.180
assumptions overturned.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.520
What do we do now, they asked.

11:48.520 --> 11:53.640
We have come a long way, said the king, yet now we are like children again.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.380
The future lies open before us.

11:56.380 --> 12:02.860
We shall go and try to do better than we have done in the past, for we have time now.

12:02.860 --> 12:08.900
Time to get things right, time to grow up, time to learn from our mistakes.

12:08.900 --> 12:14.540
Let all the bells in the kingdom ring until midnight in remembrance of our dead, then

12:14.540 --> 12:21.260
after we will celebrate and begin the process of building a better world, for we have time

12:21.260 --> 12:21.260


12:26.380 --> 12:41.300
now.
