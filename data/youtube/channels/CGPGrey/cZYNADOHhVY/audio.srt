1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Once upon a time, a dragon tyrannized the kingdom.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:12,700
Covered with thick black scales, its eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed evil-smelling slime.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,780
Some tried to fight the dragon.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,460
Priests and magicians called down curses to no avail.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,660
Warriors armed with the best weapons attacked, only to be incinerated.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:31,780
The dragon's claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armor so hard, as to make it invincible.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,220
The dragon demanded from humankind a tribute.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:42,620
Ten thousand men and women randomly chosen to be delivered every evening to the foot of the mountain to be eaten.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,940
The king and the kingdom, their weapons useless, had no choice but to pay the grisly tribute,

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,180
to suffer the misery, to feed the insatiable hunger.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,100
And humans, ever adaptable, came to accept the dragon tyrant as a fact of life,

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,100
knowing, even embracing, that everyone's final moments would be in its maw.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,820
How could the world be otherwise?

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,820
The kingdom began to teach its children that the dragon had its place in the natural order,

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,540
and the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon's stomach.

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,660
Their shorter lives motivating them to lead good lives.

17
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,100
And the dragon was helping the kingdom by keeping the population from growing too fast.

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,820
Learning this, attacks on the dragon ceased.

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,900
But the kingdom still grew, slowly.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,900
And with it, so did the dragon, becoming as big as the mountain on which it lived, its appetite increasing.

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,100
The logistics of collecting and transporting so many every day to the mountain

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,500
came to occupy the king's mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself.

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,660
The king had to hire registrars to keep track of who would be sent.

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,540
There were people collectors dispatched to fetch the designated victims,

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,020
there were clerks who administered the pensions to be paid to decimated families,

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,540
and there were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon,

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,420
trying to ease the anguish.

28
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,780
And there were dragonologists who studied how these logistic processes could be made more efficient.

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,540
Steam engines were invented and a railway constructed leading to the dragon's abode.

30
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,140
Trains arrived at the mountain terminal crammed with people and returned empty.

31
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,380
Some dragonologists also studied the dragon's behavior and collected samples.

32
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,860
Its shed scales, the slime, the excrement speckled with fragments of human bone.

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,620
The more the beast was understood, the more its invincibility confirmed.

34
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,420
But humanity is a curious species.

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,180
Every once in a while, someone gets a good idea.

36
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,220
Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements.

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,260
Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed.

38
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,460
Some of these tools make it easier to generate new ideas.

39
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,940
Thus, the great wheel of invention, which in the older ages turned imperceptibly slow,

40
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,340
began to accelerate and humans did what would have seemed magic before,

41
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,460
communicating instantly across great distance,

42
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,620
building machines that could fly and many other astonishing things.

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,780
A few dragonologists argued it might be time for a new attack.

44
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,020
One had invented a material so sharp it could pierce a dragon's scale.

45
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,220
It would not be easy, but if a huge projectile could be made out of this material

46
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,380
and launched with sufficient force and sufficient precision,

47
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,020
it might penetrate the dragon's armor.

48
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,340
However, it would be difficult and expensive and time-consuming to do.

49
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,460
The dragonologists explained their proposal to anyone who would listen.

50
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,220
But the people were skeptical.

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,980
They had been taught the dragon tyrant was invincible

52
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,540
and the sacrifices it demanded a fact of life.

53
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,060
Yet when they learnt about the new material and the idea for a projectile,

54
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,500
many became intrigued.

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,980
When the king read about the plans, he decided to hold an open hearing.

56
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,500
It took place on the last and darkest day of the year in the largest hall of the royal castle.

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,540
People packed into every last seat and crowded the aisles.

58
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,780
The king's advisor spoke first, telling the people it was best they accept the inevitability of the dragon.

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,540
And the dragon administration department provided many jobs that would be lost were the dragon slaughtered.

60
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,700
And in any case, the kingdom's coffers were empty after building the new railway.

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,300
Next, the leading dragonologist explained how the proposed device would work,

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,660
how the requisite amount of new invented material could be manufactured.

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,980
Given the requested amount of funding, it may be possible to complete the work in 15 to 20 years,

64
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,700
with greater funding, maybe 12.

65
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,060
However, there could be no guarantee.

66
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,500
Last to speak was the king's advisor for morality.

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,660
Let us grant, he said.

68
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,340
The project is technologically possible, though it hasn't been proven to me.

69
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,900
Presumably, you think you've got the right not to be chewed up.

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,980
How willful. How presumptuous. How vain.

71
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,980
The shortness of human life is a blessing.

72
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,580
Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our dignity.

73
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,980
This preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realizing more fully the aspirations

74
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,580
to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive.

75
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:06,220
The nature of the dragon is to eat, and our own nature, my friends, is nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten.

76
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,700
The dragon is necessary. The dragon is good.

77
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,060
The great hall was silent.

78
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,380
Then a small child yelled out from the audience,

79
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,180
The dragon is bad.

80
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,540
The child's parents turned red and hushed, but the child said again,

81
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,220
The dragon is bad. It kills people. It ate my granny.

82
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,060
I want my granny back.

83
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,300
The hall was silent again.

84
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,700
Then a woman stood.

85
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,820
The dragon killed my parents.

86
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,500
A man followed and stood.

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,620
The dragon killed my wife and my daughter.

88
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,060
More and more people stood.

89
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,780
The simple fact that the dragon killed everyone.

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,420
The loss of it. The weight of it crashing over the hall.

91
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,300
The way out from under, remote, yet maybe possible.

92
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,220
The king, looking at the first child to speak, announced,

93
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,100
Let us kill the dragon.

94
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,220
The next morning, a billion people woke to realize they or those they loved

95
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,340
might be sent to the dragon before the projectile launched.

96
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,900
Whereas before, active support for the anti-dragon cause had been limited,

97
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,020
it now became the number one priority and concern on everyone's mind.

98
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,300
Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase support,

99
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,460
which he did, passing extra appropriations bills and selling his summer castle, announcing,

100
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,980
I believe that this kingdom should commit itself to achieving the goal before the decade is out

101
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,700
of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon.

102
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Thus started a great technological race against time.

103
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,340
To make the dragon-killing weapon required solutions to a thousand technical problems,

104
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,420
each of which required dozens of time-consuming steps and missteps.

105
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,540
Test missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction.

106
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,980
Terrible accidents happened, but there was now a seriousness of purpose and the work continued.

107
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,420
But despite almost unlimited funding and round-the-clock work by technicians,

108
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,300
the king's deadline could not be met.

109
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
The task was hard.

110
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,500
The decade concluded and the dragon still lived, still ate.

111
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,780
But the effort was getting closer.

112
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,580
A year later, the first prototype missile successfully launched.

113
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,220
The construction of the final projectile eventually set to complete and launch on New Year's Eve,

114
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,140
12 years after the project's inauguration.

115
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,220
The last day of the year was cold and overcast, but still and clear.

116
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,140
Good launch conditions.

117
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:53,140
As the sun set, technicians scuttled around, making the final adjustments and checks.

118
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,980
The king and his advisors observed from a platform close to the launch pad.

119
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,900
Further away, behind a fence, the public assembled to witness the great event.

120
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,180
A large clock counted down.

121
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,020
Ten minutes to go.

122
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,140
The dark, slumped profile of the dragon beyond, eating.

123
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,060
From the crowd, someone jumped the fence and ran to the platform where the king sat.

124
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,260
He arrived, accompanied by security, in a frenzied state, his nose bleeding.

125
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,060
He shouted,

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,580
The last train!

127
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,060
Stop the last train!

128
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,860
The young man was a junior clerk in the Ministry of Transportation.

129
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,220
He had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain.

130
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,460
The king had ordered the trains to continue to the very end,

131
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,860
fearing any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and the missile to miss.

132
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,660
The young man begged the king to issue a recall order for the last train due to arrive at

133
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,340
the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.

134
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,780
I cannot do it, said the king.

135
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,620
I cannot take the risk it will alert the dragon.

136
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,540
The clouds above their head let loose the rain.

137
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,380
I am so sorry, the king continued.

138
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,780
Had we started but one day earlier, your father would not have to die.

139
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:18,140
Looking at the crowd, thinking of all the losses that they, and he, had endured.

140
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,980
This project should have been started years earlier than we did.

141
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,640
So many need not have been killed by the dragon, had we but awoken from our acceptance of its

142
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,500
horror sooner.

143
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,540
The young man's wailing ceased.

144
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,500
The king looked up at the countdown clock.

145
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,900
Five seconds remaining, four, three, two, one, zero.

146
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,540
A ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out.

147
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:55,140
The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, that white flame shooting

148
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,540
into the dark embodied the human spirit, its fear and its hope.

149
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,220
That struck the heart of evil.

150
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,580
The silhouette on the horizon tumbled and fell.

151
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:13,000
Thousands of voices of joy rose from the masses, joined seconds later by a deafening, drawn

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,220
out thud from the collapsing monster.

153
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,300
After all this time, humanity was at last free from the dragon.

154
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,940
The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant.

155
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,100
Long live the king, long live us all.

156
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,640
The royal entourage, huddling in the downpour, accumulated around their monarch.

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,500
So much had changed in the last hour.

158
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,940
The right to an open future had been regained, a primordial fear abolished and many long-held

159
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,180
assumptions overturned.

160
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,520
What do we do now, they asked.

161
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,640
We have come a long way, said the king, yet now we are like children again.

162
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,380
The future lies open before us.

163
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,860
We shall go and try to do better than we have done in the past, for we have time now.

164
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,900
Time to get things right, time to grow up, time to learn from our mistakes.

165
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,540
Let all the bells in the kingdom ring until midnight in remembrance of our dead, then

166
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:21,260
