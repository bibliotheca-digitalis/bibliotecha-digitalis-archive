1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
This is not just a sheet of paper, it is an invitation to everything that exists.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,240
For this paper is metric, which has a special property other pages don't.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,040
Dividing in two, each twain is half the whole.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,960
Uh, obviously, I guess.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,920
But each half is also the same shape as the whole, the ratio of its sides identical.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,880
This only works for metric, though.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,680
For origami and letter paper, their halves are half as big, but different shapes,

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,580
which is far less satisfying.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,380
A full sheet of metric is named A4, and each half A5, and each half of that A6,

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,580
all the same shape again, and so it goes in the opposite direction.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,540
Double A4 to get same-shaped A3, again to A2 to A1 to A0,

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,660
which is one square meter of paper exactly, and exactly the same shape as A4.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,660
With metric paper, everything from posters to postage can be designed on the A4 before you,

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,700
and scaled up or down perfectly.

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,460
No futzing with the margins.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,300
And everything can fit on a roll of A0 exactly for printing.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,220
It's so satisfying and practical and mathematical, each sheet of A4 so hypnotizing.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,780
This A4 is a door to the exponential spiral of everything.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,580
Begin with one sheet of A4 metric paper.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,380
Divide in half, then half the half, again and again, always creating the same shape,

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,660
dividing down to the size of a bee, and then smaller,

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,540
to the size of the organs of the bee, and the detailed limit of human vision.

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,700
But no need to stop here.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,900
At 24 divisions are the cells of the bee, each just as alive as the animal they form,

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,060
and each with their own organs carrying out the business of animating inert matter,

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,700
defending themselves from viruses, things so small as to hover on the edge of what can be alive.

27
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,220
32 divisions down and we enter the mechanical brain of this animal cell,

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,660
containing chromosomes of DNA, the operating system of life tightly coiled.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,340
But it's here the lights go out.

30
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,260
Just 39 divisions is already smaller than visible light,

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,140
and seeing in a meaningfully human way with limited human eyes is meaningless.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,740
So let us turn on atomic vision to explore what's here.

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,260
56 divisions down is the width of a strand of DNA,

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,740
where hexagonal arrangements of atoms interact mechanically to build living things,

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,820
to build more DNA.

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,540
64 divisions down is the size of a single hydrogen atom,

37
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,420
and we fall through its electron orbital to enter the interior and discover the truth of matter.

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,700
It is made of mostly nothing.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,060
Everything you touch, everything physical you care about,

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,380
is an electron cloud creating the illusion of something over nothing.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,620
At the center of the atom there is but the tiniest speck of matter,

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,220
the hydrogen nucleus, a single proton one one-hundred-thousandth the size of the atom that contains it.

43
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,180
Before yet even a hundred half divisions down from the A4 where we started,

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,180
begins to stretch human comprehensibility.

45
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,420
The proton isn't a sphere, but a sea of quarks appearing and disappearing,

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,940
averaging out two three bound together with the strongest force.

47
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,420
Here we hover above the edge of the abyss of quantum deep before plunging down into the nothing,

48
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,220
falling for twice as many divisions down as we have already traveled,

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,740
until we reach quantum madness at the very floor of the universe and the limit of our current theories,

50
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,980
the Planck length.

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:49,780
There is nothing here, yet this is the smallest size, the least distance that can be moved or measured.

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,860
A sort of reality pixel, which is best not to think about, so let us fly back up the quantum well,

53
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,860
doubling and doubling to return to the world of quarks and nuclei and atoms and light

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,260
and the illusory cloud of the physical, back to life, back to our sheet of A4 paper.

55
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:17,260
Which now unfolds itself to a sheet twice the size, doubling to the size of a desk, then a room, then a home.

56
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,220
The building the home is in, the street the building is on.

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,860
Continuing this same shape spiral to double to the size of the neighborhood around the street,

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,020
then the size of a town, a small city, a thing which is not alive,

59
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,820
but a meta-organism which lives through the actions of its human cells.

60
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,940
Just 36 doublings of a sheet of A4 is the size of the largest cities,

61
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,740
and it is at this scale the accomplishments of the human species are most visible and impressive.

62
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,460
But just a few doublings later, every structure that humans hath wrought fades to invisibility,

63
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,820
and only the light we create can be seen.

64
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,620
At twice the distance the Earth is wide are the farthest satellites,

65
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,780
passing light around Earth for instant Terran communication.

66
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,060
60 doublings brings the Moon's orbit into view, and at this scale the speed of light,

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,300
instanced just a moment ago, is now slow enough to watch move.

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,860
A beam from Earth to the Moon taking one second.

69
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,740
As far as we know, this is the speed limit of the universe.

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Nothing can travel faster.

71
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,620
Communication between Earth and Moon will always have a delay,

72
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,300
and as we resume doublings it will not be long before the speed of light proves heartbreakingly slow.

73
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,220
Past 68 doublings Earth becomes too small to see, so we must draw her orbit instead,

74
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,340
and at 76 doublings we can see the orbits of Venus and Mars.

75
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,220
Light now takes 2 minutes to reach Venus, and 14 to reach Mars.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,620
80 doublings is the distance to the Sun, our home star,

77
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,540
and doublings beyond this reveal the orbits of the outer planets,

78
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,220
and eventually the whole of the solar system, which light takes 8 hours to cross.

79
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,580
Beyond the orbit of Pluto is the Voyager 1 space probe,

80
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,980
the farthest any object produced by human civilization has traveled.

81
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,340
Yet, at the scale of all that exists, our species has explored nothing.

82
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,780
There are yet still 20 doublings to go before we've left our home star.

83
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,380
After what would take a month traveling at the speed of light, we enter the Oort cloud.

84
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,860
Icy planetesimals occasionally knock from orbit to fall inward, becoming comets.

85
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,460
It would take another year at light speed to leave the Oort cloud, and the realm of the Sun's dominance.

86
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,460
124 doublings is wide enough to reach our closest neighboring stars,

87
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,420
but at this scale they are only points of light, and thus the truth of space.

88
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,620
It is made of mostly nothing.

89
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,020
Stars, with their own planets, and potentially their own life,

90
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,340
are light years apart, with naught but stray atoms of hydrogen in between.

91
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,820
Though, as we continue doubling, the illusion of something solid appears.

92
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,980
Our galaxy.

93
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,660
This collection of 100 billion stars shining into the dark to create the appearance of a cloud.

94
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,500
At the speed of light, 100 millennia across.

95
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:22,540
But even our galaxy shrinks to a point, and now the other points of light are galaxies themselves,

96
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,300
each with billions of their own stars.

97
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,340
As the doublings continue, the galaxies form galactic filaments,

98
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,540
the largest known structures, the last threads of light in the void.

99
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:41,700
At 184 doublings of a sheet of A4 paper is the end of everything that can be for us.

100
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,660
We have reached the edge of the observable universe, a sphere containing two trillion galaxies.

101
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,300
Yet, even this may not be the end of everything that there is.

102
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,460
Beyond the observable universe is the unobservable universe,

103
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,740
in which exist objects so distant, light traveling from them beyond this border

104
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,260
will never reach Earth before the death of every living thing everywhere,

105
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,860
caused by the extinction of every star and the end of the universe itself.

106
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,820
Just how many doublings exist beyond is unknowable,

107
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,980
but potentially enough to shrink everything that could ever be for us into nothing,

108
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
in infinite nothing.
