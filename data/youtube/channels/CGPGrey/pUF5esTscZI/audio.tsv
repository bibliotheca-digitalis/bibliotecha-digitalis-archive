0	5500	This is not just a sheet of paper, it is an invitation to everything that exists.
5500	10240	For this paper is metric, which has a special property other pages don't.
10240	13040	Dividing in two, each twain is half the whole.
13040	14960	Uh, obviously, I guess.
14960	19920	But each half is also the same shape as the whole, the ratio of its sides identical.
19920	21880	This only works for metric, though.
21880	26680	For origami and letter paper, their halves are half as big, but different shapes,
26680	28580	which is far less satisfying.
28580	34380	A full sheet of metric is named A4, and each half A5, and each half of that A6,
34380	38580	all the same shape again, and so it goes in the opposite direction.
38580	43540	Double A4 to get same-shaped A3, again to A2 to A1 to A0,
43540	48660	which is one square meter of paper exactly, and exactly the same shape as A4.
48660	53660	With metric paper, everything from posters to postage can be designed on the A4 before you,
53660	55700	and scaled up or down perfectly.
55700	57460	No futzing with the margins.
57460	61300	And everything can fit on a roll of A0 exactly for printing.
61300	68220	It's so satisfying and practical and mathematical, each sheet of A4 so hypnotizing.
68220	74780	This A4 is a door to the exponential spiral of everything.
75780	78580	Begin with one sheet of A4 metric paper.
78580	85380	Divide in half, then half the half, again and again, always creating the same shape,
85380	89660	dividing down to the size of a bee, and then smaller,
89660	95540	to the size of the organs of the bee, and the detailed limit of human vision.
95540	97700	But no need to stop here.
97700	103900	At 24 divisions are the cells of the bee, each just as alive as the animal they form,
103900	109060	and each with their own organs carrying out the business of animating inert matter,
109060	115700	defending themselves from viruses, things so small as to hover on the edge of what can be alive.
115700	120220	32 divisions down and we enter the mechanical brain of this animal cell,
120220	125660	containing chromosomes of DNA, the operating system of life tightly coiled.
125660	128340	But it's here the lights go out.
128340	132260	Just 39 divisions is already smaller than visible light,
132260	138140	and seeing in a meaningfully human way with limited human eyes is meaningless.
138140	142740	So let us turn on atomic vision to explore what's here.
142740	146260	56 divisions down is the width of a strand of DNA,
146260	151740	where hexagonal arrangements of atoms interact mechanically to build living things,
151740	153820	to build more DNA.
153820	157540	64 divisions down is the size of a single hydrogen atom,
157540	164420	and we fall through its electron orbital to enter the interior and discover the truth of matter.
164420	166700	It is made of mostly nothing.
166700	170060	Everything you touch, everything physical you care about,
170060	175380	is an electron cloud creating the illusion of something over nothing.
175380	179620	At the center of the atom there is but the tiniest speck of matter,
179620	186220	the hydrogen nucleus, a single proton one one-hundred-thousandth the size of the atom that contains it.
186220	191180	Before yet even a hundred half divisions down from the A4 where we started,
191180	194180	begins to stretch human comprehensibility.
194180	199420	The proton isn't a sphere, but a sea of quarks appearing and disappearing,
199420	203940	averaging out two three bound together with the strongest force.
203940	210420	Here we hover above the edge of the abyss of quantum deep before plunging down into the nothing,
210420	214220	falling for twice as many divisions down as we have already traveled,
214220	220740	until we reach quantum madness at the very floor of the universe and the limit of our current theories,
220740	221980	the Planck length.
221980	229780	There is nothing here, yet this is the smallest size, the least distance that can be moved or measured.
229780	236860	A sort of reality pixel, which is best not to think about, so let us fly back up the quantum well,
236860	241860	doubling and doubling to return to the world of quarks and nuclei and atoms and light
241860	248260	and the illusory cloud of the physical, back to life, back to our sheet of A4 paper.
248300	257260	Which now unfolds itself to a sheet twice the size, doubling to the size of a desk, then a room, then a home.
257260	261220	The building the home is in, the street the building is on.
261220	266860	Continuing this same shape spiral to double to the size of the neighborhood around the street,
266860	272020	then the size of a town, a small city, a thing which is not alive,
272020	276820	but a meta-organism which lives through the actions of its human cells.
276820	281940	Just 36 doublings of a sheet of A4 is the size of the largest cities,
281940	287740	and it is at this scale the accomplishments of the human species are most visible and impressive.
287740	294460	But just a few doublings later, every structure that humans hath wrought fades to invisibility,
294460	297820	and only the light we create can be seen.
297820	301620	At twice the distance the Earth is wide are the farthest satellites,
301620	305780	passing light around Earth for instant Terran communication.
305780	311060	60 doublings brings the Moon's orbit into view, and at this scale the speed of light,
311060	315300	instanced just a moment ago, is now slow enough to watch move.
315300	318860	A beam from Earth to the Moon taking one second.
318860	322740	As far as we know, this is the speed limit of the universe.
322740	324740	Nothing can travel faster.
324740	328620	Communication between Earth and Moon will always have a delay,
328620	335300	and as we resume doublings it will not be long before the speed of light proves heartbreakingly slow.
335300	341220	Past 68 doublings Earth becomes too small to see, so we must draw her orbit instead,
341220	346340	and at 76 doublings we can see the orbits of Venus and Mars.
346340	351220	Light now takes 2 minutes to reach Venus, and 14 to reach Mars.
351220	354620	80 doublings is the distance to the Sun, our home star,
354620	358540	and doublings beyond this reveal the orbits of the outer planets,
358540	364220	and eventually the whole of the solar system, which light takes 8 hours to cross.
364220	367580	Beyond the orbit of Pluto is the Voyager 1 space probe,
367580	371980	the farthest any object produced by human civilization has traveled.
371980	377340	Yet, at the scale of all that exists, our species has explored nothing.
377340	381780	There are yet still 20 doublings to go before we've left our home star.
381780	386380	After what would take a month traveling at the speed of light, we enter the Oort cloud.
386380	391860	Icy planetesimals occasionally knock from orbit to fall inward, becoming comets.
391860	397460	It would take another year at light speed to leave the Oort cloud, and the realm of the Sun's dominance.
397460	402460	124 doublings is wide enough to reach our closest neighboring stars,
402460	408420	but at this scale they are only points of light, and thus the truth of space.
408420	410620	It is made of mostly nothing.
410620	414020	Stars, with their own planets, and potentially their own life,
414020	419340	are light years apart, with naught but stray atoms of hydrogen in between.
419340	423820	Though, as we continue doubling, the illusion of something solid appears.
423820	424980	Our galaxy.
424980	431660	This collection of 100 billion stars shining into the dark to create the appearance of a cloud.
431660	435500	At the speed of light, 100 millennia across.
435500	442540	But even our galaxy shrinks to a point, and now the other points of light are galaxies themselves,
442540	445300	each with billions of their own stars.
445300	449340	As the doublings continue, the galaxies form galactic filaments,
449340	454540	the largest known structures, the last threads of light in the void.
454540	461700	At 184 doublings of a sheet of A4 paper is the end of everything that can be for us.
461700	467660	We have reached the edge of the observable universe, a sphere containing two trillion galaxies.
467660	472300	Yet, even this may not be the end of everything that there is.
472300	476460	Beyond the observable universe is the unobservable universe,
476460	481740	in which exist objects so distant, light traveling from them beyond this border
481740	486260	will never reach Earth before the death of every living thing everywhere,
486260	491860	caused by the extinction of every star and the end of the universe itself.
491860	495820	Just how many doublings exist beyond is unknowable,
495820	501980	but potentially enough to shrink everything that could ever be for us into nothing,
501980	503980	in infinite nothing.
