0	3540	Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is giving more democracy to her citizens by adding a
3540	5780	legislative branch to the government.
5780	8880	The citizens each get one vote and are divided into ranges.
8880	13240	Each range will elect one representative to send to the newly created Jungle Council.
13240	16360	To best understand how the system works, let's take a look at a small colony where there
16360	19860	are just two political parties, the Buffalo and Jackalope.
19860	22080	This colony is divided into four ranges.
22080	25520	In the first election, Jackalope candidates win two of them and Buffalo candidates win
25520	26760	the rest.
26760	30700	All is well for several election cycles until the Animal Kingdom census taker comes around
30700	33740	and shows that the population has both moved and grown.
33740	37240	To better represent the larger population, a new seat is added to the Jungle Council
37240	40080	so the range's boundaries must be redrawn.
40080	41920	This is where the trouble begins.
41920	44820	Redrawing electoral boundaries is a huge political problem.
44820	48760	To help them, the representatives of the Jungle Council hire a Weasle-y consultant to figure
48760	51120	out where the new boundaries should go.
51120	55320	If Weasle draws rectangular boundaries, everything will be okay because the Jungle Council will,
55320	58360	as close as possible, reflect how the citizens vote.
58360	60240	However, Weasle doesn't do this.
60240	64640	Instead, he tells the Buffalo party that, for a price, he can turn their slim majority
64640	67400	into a landslide victory in the election.
67400	70660	With a supermajority on the Jungle Council, the Buffalo wouldn't have to listen to those
70660	75000	pesky Jackalope filibusters anymore, so the Buffalo gladly pay up.
75000	76760	How can Weasle deliver on his promise?
76760	78320	It's depressingly simple.
78320	81920	By packing together as many Jackalope voters into one range as possible and spreading the
81920	85840	rest of them out, the Buffalo party can win an additional seat without any voters switching
85840	87160	allegiance.
87160	90600	What Weasle and the Buffalo have done is called gerrymandering, the intentional changing of
90600	93200	electoral boundaries for their benefit.
93200	97200	Several election cycles later, the underrepresented and disgruntled Jackalope party approaches
97200	101920	Weasle and asks if he can manipulate the ranges to be in their favor instead of in the Buffalo's.
101920	103520	Why indeed he can?
103520	107360	Using the same trick, Weasle packs Buffalo voters into a few ranges and spreads the rest
107360	109520	among the Jackalope supporters.
109720	114160	After the election, the Jackalopes, who represent a minority of voters, are now nonetheless
114160	117440	the majority party on the Jungle Council.
117440	120000	This is the terrible power of gerrymandering.
120000	124280	Weasle can take the exact same voters and get either party to win the election.
124280	128100	Unsurprisingly, Weasle's business grows and eventually every colony in the animal kingdom
128100	130560	pays him to gerrymander their ranges.
130560	133960	With so many clients, Weasle now uses his computer to test hundreds of thousands of
133960	138020	range combinations with elaborate statistical models of voter behavior to get the results
138020	139320	he needs.
139320	142920	Queen Lion has seen what Weasle is up to and banishes him from her kingdom.
142920	147260	But the census taker reminds her that ranges still need to be redrawn as the population
147260	149920	changes, so how is it going to be decided?
149920	153680	Queen Lion suggests the obvious solution, a bipartisan committee must agree on all new
153680	155280	range boundaries.
155280	156660	This seems like a good idea.
156660	159760	After all, if both parties have to agree on the ranges, then they must end up being fair
159760	161200	to everyone.
161200	165280	But after a few election cycles using this solution, Queen Lion notices that she always
165280	168300	sees the same faces on the Jungle Council.
168300	171040	Representatives almost never get defeated in their elections.
171040	174480	It turns out that the interests of the representatives and the interests of the citizens are not
174480	175900	the same.
175900	179440	Citizens want elections where the candidates have to earn their vote, these are close elections
179440	182120	where either candidate has a chance of winning.
182120	186360	But representatives don't want close elections, they want safe elections.
186360	189680	Elections where they run in a range that is filled with supporters.
189680	192920	Because the representatives are in charge of the boundaries, they make the safest ranges
192920	193920	possible.
193920	195760	So bipartisan committees are not enough.
195760	198440	To truly fix gerrymandering, there are three options.
198440	202040	The first is to set up a politically independent commission of appointed experts or judges
202040	204060	to draw the boundaries.
204060	206920	Independent commissions are much better than bipartisan committees, but still not ideal
206920	210600	because they usually group similar areas together, so the elections are uncompetitive.
210600	214840	And there's always the possibility that the independent commission is not as independent
214840	216200	as it appears.
216200	218840	The second option is to let math decide the boundaries.
218840	222840	There are a number of ways to mathematically divide an area into equally populous ranges.
222840	226080	The simplest example of this is called the shortest split line method.
226080	229500	Find the shortest line that splits the voters in twain, and repeat as necessary until all
229500	231320	the ranges are made.
231320	234500	This is much better than an independent commission, but it does have the problem of occasionally
234500	237800	producing skewed election results just through the pure bad luck of where the boundaries
237800	239280	are drawn.
239280	243400	But by publishing the algorithm used, all citizens can check the results and be confident
243400	246240	that there is no intentional bias in the system.
246240	251180	The last solution is an unexpected one, hire back the weasel and embrace gerrymandering.
251180	255140	But this time, pay him to make the winners most closely match the voters as a whole.
255140	259260	While it seems unsavory, this is actually the best way to avoid disproportionate representation,
259260	262780	which is, by far, the worst problem of gerrymandering.
262780	266020	But considering these three solutions leaves Queen Lion grumpy.
266020	269900	The first two are improvements, but still may result in uncompetitive elections or disproportionate
269900	273420	results, while the third just feels wrong.
273420	276740	Gerrymandering to avoid the problems of gerrymandering isâ€¦ odd.
276740	280200	Remembering what she learned about voting before, she realizes that all this gerrymandering
280240	284240	is really just a symptom of a more fundamental problem, the method by which each citizen
284240	287720	gets only one vote and elects only one representative.
287720	291080	There are ways to eliminate gerrymandering and restore competitive elections to make
291080	295340	her citizens happy, but to do that, Queen Lion is going to have to make some big, fundamental
295340	296680	changes to her democracy.
