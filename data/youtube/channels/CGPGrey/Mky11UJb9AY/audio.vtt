00:00.000 --> 00:03.540
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is giving more democracy to her citizens by adding a

00:03.540 --> 00:05.780
legislative branch to the government.

00:05.780 --> 00:08.880
The citizens each get one vote and are divided into ranges.

00:08.880 --> 00:13.240
Each range will elect one representative to send to the newly created Jungle Council.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.360
To best understand how the system works, let's take a look at a small colony where there

00:16.360 --> 00:19.860
are just two political parties, the Buffalo and Jackalope.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.080
This colony is divided into four ranges.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.520
In the first election, Jackalope candidates win two of them and Buffalo candidates win

00:25.520 --> 00:26.760
the rest.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.700
All is well for several election cycles until the Animal Kingdom census taker comes around

00:30.700 --> 00:33.740
and shows that the population has both moved and grown.

00:33.740 --> 00:37.240
To better represent the larger population, a new seat is added to the Jungle Council

00:37.240 --> 00:40.080
so the range's boundaries must be redrawn.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.920
This is where the trouble begins.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.820
Redrawing electoral boundaries is a huge political problem.

00:44.820 --> 00:48.760
To help them, the representatives of the Jungle Council hire a Weasle-y consultant to figure

00:48.760 --> 00:51.120
out where the new boundaries should go.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.320
If Weasle draws rectangular boundaries, everything will be okay because the Jungle Council will,

00:55.320 --> 00:58.360
as close as possible, reflect how the citizens vote.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.240
However, Weasle doesn't do this.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.640
Instead, he tells the Buffalo party that, for a price, he can turn their slim majority

01:04.640 --> 01:07.400
into a landslide victory in the election.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.660
With a supermajority on the Jungle Council, the Buffalo wouldn't have to listen to those

01:10.660 --> 01:15.000
pesky Jackalope filibusters anymore, so the Buffalo gladly pay up.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.760
How can Weasle deliver on his promise?

01:16.760 --> 01:18.320
It's depressingly simple.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.920
By packing together as many Jackalope voters into one range as possible and spreading the

01:21.920 --> 01:25.840
rest of them out, the Buffalo party can win an additional seat without any voters switching

01:25.840 --> 01:27.160
allegiance.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.600
What Weasle and the Buffalo have done is called gerrymandering, the intentional changing of

01:30.600 --> 01:33.200
electoral boundaries for their benefit.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.200
Several election cycles later, the underrepresented and disgruntled Jackalope party approaches

01:37.200 --> 01:41.920
Weasle and asks if he can manipulate the ranges to be in their favor instead of in the Buffalo's.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.520
Why indeed he can?

01:43.520 --> 01:47.360
Using the same trick, Weasle packs Buffalo voters into a few ranges and spreads the rest

01:47.360 --> 01:49.520
among the Jackalope supporters.

01:49.720 --> 01:54.160
After the election, the Jackalopes, who represent a minority of voters, are now nonetheless

01:54.160 --> 01:57.440
the majority party on the Jungle Council.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.000
This is the terrible power of gerrymandering.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.280
Weasle can take the exact same voters and get either party to win the election.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.100
Unsurprisingly, Weasle's business grows and eventually every colony in the animal kingdom

02:08.100 --> 02:10.560
pays him to gerrymander their ranges.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.960
With so many clients, Weasle now uses his computer to test hundreds of thousands of

02:13.960 --> 02:18.020
range combinations with elaborate statistical models of voter behavior to get the results

02:18.020 --> 02:19.320
he needs.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.920
Queen Lion has seen what Weasle is up to and banishes him from her kingdom.

02:22.920 --> 02:27.260
But the census taker reminds her that ranges still need to be redrawn as the population

02:27.260 --> 02:29.920
changes, so how is it going to be decided?

02:29.920 --> 02:33.680
Queen Lion suggests the obvious solution, a bipartisan committee must agree on all new

02:33.680 --> 02:35.280
range boundaries.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.660
This seems like a good idea.

02:36.660 --> 02:39.760
After all, if both parties have to agree on the ranges, then they must end up being fair

02:39.760 --> 02:41.200
to everyone.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.280
But after a few election cycles using this solution, Queen Lion notices that she always

02:45.280 --> 02:48.300
sees the same faces on the Jungle Council.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.040
Representatives almost never get defeated in their elections.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.480
It turns out that the interests of the representatives and the interests of the citizens are not

02:54.480 --> 02:55.900
the same.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.440
Citizens want elections where the candidates have to earn their vote, these are close elections

02:59.440 --> 03:02.120
where either candidate has a chance of winning.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.360
But representatives don't want close elections, they want safe elections.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.680
Elections where they run in a range that is filled with supporters.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.920
Because the representatives are in charge of the boundaries, they make the safest ranges

03:12.920 --> 03:13.920
possible.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.760
So bipartisan committees are not enough.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.440
To truly fix gerrymandering, there are three options.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.040
The first is to set up a politically independent commission of appointed experts or judges

03:22.040 --> 03:24.060
to draw the boundaries.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.920
Independent commissions are much better than bipartisan committees, but still not ideal

03:26.920 --> 03:30.600
because they usually group similar areas together, so the elections are uncompetitive.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.840
And there's always the possibility that the independent commission is not as independent

03:34.840 --> 03:36.200
as it appears.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.840
The second option is to let math decide the boundaries.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.840
There are a number of ways to mathematically divide an area into equally populous ranges.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.080
The simplest example of this is called the shortest split line method.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.500
Find the shortest line that splits the voters in twain, and repeat as necessary until all

03:49.500 --> 03:51.320
the ranges are made.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.500
This is much better than an independent commission, but it does have the problem of occasionally

03:54.500 --> 03:57.800
producing skewed election results just through the pure bad luck of where the boundaries

03:57.800 --> 03:59.280
are drawn.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.400
But by publishing the algorithm used, all citizens can check the results and be confident

04:03.400 --> 04:06.240
that there is no intentional bias in the system.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.180
The last solution is an unexpected one, hire back the weasel and embrace gerrymandering.

04:11.180 --> 04:15.140
But this time, pay him to make the winners most closely match the voters as a whole.

04:15.140 --> 04:19.260
While it seems unsavory, this is actually the best way to avoid disproportionate representation,

04:19.260 --> 04:22.780
which is, by far, the worst problem of gerrymandering.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.020
But considering these three solutions leaves Queen Lion grumpy.

04:26.020 --> 04:29.900
The first two are improvements, but still may result in uncompetitive elections or disproportionate

04:29.900 --> 04:33.420
results, while the third just feels wrong.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.740
Gerrymandering to avoid the problems of gerrymandering isâ€¦ odd.

04:36.740 --> 04:40.200
Remembering what she learned about voting before, she realizes that all this gerrymandering

04:40.240 --> 04:44.240
is really just a symptom of a more fundamental problem, the method by which each citizen

04:44.240 --> 04:47.720
gets only one vote and elects only one representative.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.080
There are ways to eliminate gerrymandering and restore competitive elections to make

04:51.080 --> 04:55.340
her citizens happy, but to do that, Queen Lion is going to have to make some big, fundamental

04:55.340 --> 04:56.680
changes to her democracy.
