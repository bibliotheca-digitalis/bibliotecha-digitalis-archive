1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is giving more democracy to her citizens by adding a

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,780
legislative branch to the government.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,880
The citizens each get one vote and are divided into ranges.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,240
Each range will elect one representative to send to the newly created Jungle Council.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,360
To best understand how the system works, let's take a look at a small colony where there

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,860
are just two political parties, the Buffalo and Jackalope.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,080
This colony is divided into four ranges.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,520
In the first election, Jackalope candidates win two of them and Buffalo candidates win

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,760
the rest.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,700
All is well for several election cycles until the Animal Kingdom census taker comes around

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,740
and shows that the population has both moved and grown.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,240
To better represent the larger population, a new seat is added to the Jungle Council

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,080
so the range's boundaries must be redrawn.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,920
This is where the trouble begins.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,820
Redrawing electoral boundaries is a huge political problem.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,760
To help them, the representatives of the Jungle Council hire a Weasle-y consultant to figure

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,120
out where the new boundaries should go.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,320
If Weasle draws rectangular boundaries, everything will be okay because the Jungle Council will,

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,360
as close as possible, reflect how the citizens vote.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,240
However, Weasle doesn't do this.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,640
Instead, he tells the Buffalo party that, for a price, he can turn their slim majority

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,400
into a landslide victory in the election.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,660
With a supermajority on the Jungle Council, the Buffalo wouldn't have to listen to those

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,000
pesky Jackalope filibusters anymore, so the Buffalo gladly pay up.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,760
How can Weasle deliver on his promise?

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,320
It's depressingly simple.

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,920
By packing together as many Jackalope voters into one range as possible and spreading the

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
rest of them out, the Buffalo party can win an additional seat without any voters switching

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,160
allegiance.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,600
What Weasle and the Buffalo have done is called gerrymandering, the intentional changing of

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,200
electoral boundaries for their benefit.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Several election cycles later, the underrepresented and disgruntled Jackalope party approaches

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Weasle and asks if he can manipulate the ranges to be in their favor instead of in the Buffalo's.

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
Why indeed he can?

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Using the same trick, Weasle packs Buffalo voters into a few ranges and spreads the rest

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
among the Jackalope supporters.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,160
After the election, the Jackalopes, who represent a minority of voters, are now nonetheless

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,440
the majority party on the Jungle Council.

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,000
This is the terrible power of gerrymandering.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,280
Weasle can take the exact same voters and get either party to win the election.

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,100
Unsurprisingly, Weasle's business grows and eventually every colony in the animal kingdom

42
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,560
pays him to gerrymander their ranges.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,960
With so many clients, Weasle now uses his computer to test hundreds of thousands of

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,020
range combinations with elaborate statistical models of voter behavior to get the results

45
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,320
he needs.

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,920
Queen Lion has seen what Weasle is up to and banishes him from her kingdom.

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,260
But the census taker reminds her that ranges still need to be redrawn as the population

48
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,920
changes, so how is it going to be decided?

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,680
Queen Lion suggests the obvious solution, a bipartisan committee must agree on all new

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
range boundaries.

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,660
This seems like a good idea.

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,760
After all, if both parties have to agree on the ranges, then they must end up being fair

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
to everyone.

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,280
But after a few election cycles using this solution, Queen Lion notices that she always

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,300
sees the same faces on the Jungle Council.

56
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,040
Representatives almost never get defeated in their elections.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,480
It turns out that the interests of the representatives and the interests of the citizens are not

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,900
the same.

59
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,440
Citizens want elections where the candidates have to earn their vote, these are close elections

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,120
where either candidate has a chance of winning.

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,360
But representatives don't want close elections, they want safe elections.

62
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,680
Elections where they run in a range that is filled with supporters.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,920
Because the representatives are in charge of the boundaries, they make the safest ranges

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
possible.

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
So bipartisan committees are not enough.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,440
To truly fix gerrymandering, there are three options.

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,040
The first is to set up a politically independent commission of appointed experts or judges

68
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,060
to draw the boundaries.

69
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,920
Independent commissions are much better than bipartisan committees, but still not ideal

70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,600
because they usually group similar areas together, so the elections are uncompetitive.

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,840
And there's always the possibility that the independent commission is not as independent

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,200
as it appears.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,840
The second option is to let math decide the boundaries.

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,840
There are a number of ways to mathematically divide an area into equally populous ranges.

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,080
The simplest example of this is called the shortest split line method.

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,500
Find the shortest line that splits the voters in twain, and repeat as necessary until all

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,320
the ranges are made.

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,500
This is much better than an independent commission, but it does have the problem of occasionally

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,800
producing skewed election results just through the pure bad luck of where the boundaries

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,280
are drawn.

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,400
But by publishing the algorithm used, all citizens can check the results and be confident

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,240
that there is no intentional bias in the system.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,180
The last solution is an unexpected one, hire back the weasel and embrace gerrymandering.

84
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,140
But this time, pay him to make the winners most closely match the voters as a whole.

85
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,260
While it seems unsavory, this is actually the best way to avoid disproportionate representation,

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,780
which is, by far, the worst problem of gerrymandering.

87
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,020
But considering these three solutions leaves Queen Lion grumpy.

88
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,900
The first two are improvements, but still may result in uncompetitive elections or disproportionate

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,420
results, while the third just feels wrong.

90
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,740
Gerrymandering to avoid the problems of gerrymandering isâ€¦ odd.

91
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,200
Remembering what she learned about voting before, she realizes that all this gerrymandering

92
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
is really just a symptom of a more fundamental problem, the method by which each citizen

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,720
gets only one vote and elects only one representative.

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,080
There are ways to eliminate gerrymandering and restore competitive elections to make

95
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,340
her citizens happy, but to do that, Queen Lion is going to have to make some big, fundamental

96
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,680
changes to her democracy.
