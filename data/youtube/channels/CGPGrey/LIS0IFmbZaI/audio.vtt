Hello internet!

00:01.120 --> 00:03.920
While working on a future video, I offhandedly wrote

00:03.920 --> 00:06.160
Venus, the closest planet to Earth.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.440
But later, while editing, I thought, you know, let me check that.

00:09.440 --> 00:15.280
Which led me to this video by Dr. Stockman explaining how, no, Venus is not the closest.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.040
This blew my mind and I contacted the author to

00:19.040 --> 00:22.320
adapt his video into the one you probably just watched.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.600
It blew my mind not just because it was surprising,

00:25.600 --> 00:29.360
but also because I taught physics for years and probably said,

00:29.360 --> 00:34.400
Venus is the closest planet dozens of times without ever thinking about it.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.680
How does that happen?

00:35.680 --> 00:38.880
First, asking the precisely right question is vital.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.800
Which planet is closest is not the precisely right question,

00:42.800 --> 00:44.880
because it's really made of four parts.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.120
Which planet ever gets the closest?

00:47.120 --> 00:49.920
Which planet is the closest for the longest time?

00:49.920 --> 00:53.600
Which planet has the shortest average distance to Earth?

00:53.600 --> 00:56.640
Which planet takes the least amount of time to travel to?

00:56.640 --> 01:00.160
The answer to the first one is Venus, the second to Mercury,

01:00.160 --> 01:02.960
the last, it's complicated, get a physics degree.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.240
Literal rocket scientists think mostly about that last question,

01:06.240 --> 01:09.680
and the rest of us are probably vaguely asking about the first,

01:09.680 --> 01:11.440
when we say which is the closest.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.720
Because we're not thinking about the planets in motion.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.480
If we were, we'd ask something closer to questions two and three,

01:18.480 --> 01:20.320
which is what the main video is about.

01:20.320 --> 01:24.720
Mercury, on average, has the shortest distance to all the other planets.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.880
And for the inner planets, it's also the closest planet most of the time.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.240
But to get an answer that precise requires a precise question.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.520
Unlike the way things are done in school, where questions yield knowledge,

01:35.520 --> 01:39.120
it's knowledge that yields questions which yield knowledge.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.640
Now, it's hard to think about the raw knowledge of everything all at once,

01:42.640 --> 01:47.280
so we condense down part of what we know into a model to help us think,

01:47.280 --> 01:49.200
like with the line of the planets.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.560
But as with fuzzy questions, models can trick us too.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.840
Which planet is the closest looks like a simple and easy question

01:55.840 --> 01:57.920
when the solar system is shown this way.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.360
Like, even when you know this isn't really how the solar system looks,

02:01.360 --> 02:02.720
can't possibly be.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.400
In my old video about Pluto, where I sound like a completely different person,

02:06.400 --> 02:09.840
I cover this exact point as I've often done in class.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.720
If we take this diagram and adjust for the correct sizes of the planets,

02:12.720 --> 02:13.920
it looks like this.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.760
Think about it, if Jupiter was this close to Earth,

02:15.760 --> 02:17.600
it wouldn't look like a dot in the night sky,

02:17.600 --> 02:19.280
but would be rather overwhelming.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.280
So it must be really far away.

02:21.280 --> 02:25.040
Still, the model gets into your head in ways you don't notice

02:25.040 --> 02:29.600
and lets you ask imprecise questions, easily but insufficiently answered.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.880
The result is something that's retroactively obvious can hide for a long time.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.360
The fact about Mercury being the closest on average

02:37.360 --> 02:39.360
feels like something Newton could have noticed.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.520
But it wasn't published until this year, which is crazy.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.000
It's a property of concentric circles.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.080
Something Pythagoras, were he not so obsessed with triangles, might have noticed.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.200
So I love this fact about Mercury being the closest planet,

02:53.200 --> 02:55.280
depending on exactly what you mean by closest,

02:55.280 --> 03:00.480
because it's a fantastic example of how if you can get rid of old or incorrect models

03:00.480 --> 03:05.200
from your head and think clearly in a way to ask a precise question,

03:05.200 --> 03:08.320
the universe awaits with new knowledge for you to find.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.920
Isn't that great?
