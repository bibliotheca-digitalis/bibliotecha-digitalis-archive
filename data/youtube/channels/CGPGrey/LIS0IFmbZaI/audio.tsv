0	1120	Hello internet!
1120	3920	While working on a future video, I offhandedly wrote
3920	6160	Venus, the closest planet to Earth.
6160	9440	But later, while editing, I thought, you know, let me check that.
9440	15280	Which led me to this video by Dr. Stockman explaining how, no, Venus is not the closest.
15280	19040	This blew my mind and I contacted the author to
19040	22320	adapt his video into the one you probably just watched.
22320	25600	It blew my mind not just because it was surprising,
25600	29360	but also because I taught physics for years and probably said,
29360	34400	Venus is the closest planet dozens of times without ever thinking about it.
34400	35680	How does that happen?
35680	38880	First, asking the precisely right question is vital.
38880	42800	Which planet is closest is not the precisely right question,
42800	44880	because it's really made of four parts.
44880	47120	Which planet ever gets the closest?
47120	49920	Which planet is the closest for the longest time?
49920	53600	Which planet has the shortest average distance to Earth?
53600	56640	Which planet takes the least amount of time to travel to?
56640	60160	The answer to the first one is Venus, the second to Mercury,
60160	62960	the last, it's complicated, get a physics degree.
62960	66240	Literal rocket scientists think mostly about that last question,
66240	69680	and the rest of us are probably vaguely asking about the first,
69680	71440	when we say which is the closest.
71440	74720	Because we're not thinking about the planets in motion.
74720	78480	If we were, we'd ask something closer to questions two and three,
78480	80320	which is what the main video is about.
80320	84720	Mercury, on average, has the shortest distance to all the other planets.
84800	88880	And for the inner planets, it's also the closest planet most of the time.
88880	92240	But to get an answer that precise requires a precise question.
92240	95520	Unlike the way things are done in school, where questions yield knowledge,
95520	99120	it's knowledge that yields questions which yield knowledge.
99120	102640	Now, it's hard to think about the raw knowledge of everything all at once,
102640	107280	so we condense down part of what we know into a model to help us think,
107280	109200	like with the line of the planets.
109200	112560	But as with fuzzy questions, models can trick us too.
112560	115840	Which planet is the closest looks like a simple and easy question
115840	117920	when the solar system is shown this way.
117920	121360	Like, even when you know this isn't really how the solar system looks,
121360	122720	can't possibly be.
122720	126400	In my old video about Pluto, where I sound like a completely different person,
126400	129840	I cover this exact point as I've often done in class.
129840	132720	If we take this diagram and adjust for the correct sizes of the planets,
132720	133920	it looks like this.
133920	135760	Think about it, if Jupiter was this close to Earth,
135760	137600	it wouldn't look like a dot in the night sky,
137600	139280	but would be rather overwhelming.
139280	141280	So it must be really far away.
141280	145040	Still, the model gets into your head in ways you don't notice
145040	149600	and lets you ask imprecise questions, easily but insufficiently answered.
149600	154880	The result is something that's retroactively obvious can hide for a long time.
154880	157360	The fact about Mercury being the closest on average
157360	159360	feels like something Newton could have noticed.
159360	163520	But it wasn't published until this year, which is crazy.
163520	166000	It's a property of concentric circles.
166000	170080	Something Pythagoras, were he not so obsessed with triangles, might have noticed.
170080	173200	So I love this fact about Mercury being the closest planet,
173200	175280	depending on exactly what you mean by closest,
175280	180480	because it's a fantastic example of how if you can get rid of old or incorrect models
180480	185200	from your head and think clearly in a way to ask a precise question,
185200	188320	the universe awaits with new knowledge for you to find.
188960	189920	Isn't that great?
