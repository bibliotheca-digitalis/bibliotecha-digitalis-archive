1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
How many continents are there?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,960
If you grew up in the English-speaking world, you might think that the answer is obvious

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,280
– 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,920
But not everyone counts continents the same way.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,160
The usual definition – that they're large landmasses separated from others by oceans

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,220
– is fine until you actually start to think about it and then you run into problems.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,220
Problems like this.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,640
Here's Europe, here's Asia, and you'll notice the lack of ocean between them.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,680
Then why are they two different continents?

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,200
The usual reason for this split is a cultural one – that Europe is so different from Asia

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,480
that it's best to pretend it's a separate entity.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,280
Okay, maybe.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,720
But if the cultural argument is valid, then surely it also applies to India and the Middle

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
East.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,580
Now you have nine continents and a new problem.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,960
If culture defines continents, then you'll never stop drawing increasingly unhelpful

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
lines.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,840
So some places ditch the cultural division and combine Europe and Asia into Eurasia.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,880
This Eurasia is not to be confused with this Eurasia, which has always been at war with

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,440
East Asia.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
Making Eurasia gives a six-continent view of the world.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,840
But what about over here?

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
North America and South America?

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,800
They're connected to Panama, or at least they used to be until Teddy Roosevelt decided

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,140
that someone had to cut that country in half and it might as well be him.

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,480
But even still, the canal's only 13 meters deep.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,360
You could walk all the way from northern Alaska across the narrow Panama Canal and, if it

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,020
weren't for the deadly, impenetrable, poison-filled Brazilian rainforest, make it all the way

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,320
to the southern tip of Chile.

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,680
So North and South America, despite the canal, aren't really divided.

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,080
Which is why some places, particularly South America, treat America as a single continent,

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
not two.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,800
Which brings the total number of continents down to five.

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,080
But if you disregard the Panama Canal, then you also have to disregard the Suez Canal,

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,820
and you've just created the monstrously large Afro-Eurasian continent, 85 million

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,200
square kilometers, home to 5.7 billion people.

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
With this four-continent view of the world, we must surely be done, because there are

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,400
no more continents to merge and our definition from the beginning is now consistent.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,900
Except we're not done, because of that troublesome word large.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,360
Exactly how large is continental large?

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,600
Is Australia really a dinky continent, or is it king of the islands?

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,360
Why not make Greenland the smallest continent?

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,720
It's pretty big, even if you took away its ice.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,620
And speaking of ice, what about Antarctica?

45
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,960
The forgotten continent, unfairly smushed against the bottom of maps just because no

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,400
one lives there.

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,880
Remove the ice sheet that covers Antarctica, and you reveal it for the archipelago it really

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,480
is, not the single landmass it pretends to be.

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,580
And to complicate matters, the largest of these Antarctic islands is smaller than Australia.

50
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,360
So if you want to keep calling Antarctica a continent, then there's a bunch of other

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,920
islands that might want to be continents too.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,680
Islands like New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar, Baffin Islands, Sumatra, and Honshu.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,720
While this seems inclusive to the point of silliness, ultimately someone has to decide

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,840
what large means, and that's going to be an arbitrary line.

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,420
This problem will be familiar to anyone who remembers the is Pluto a planet or not a planet

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,240
fiasco which hinged, mostly, on this same issue of size.

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
So now we're more confused than before we started.

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,640
There might be three continents, or dozens.

59
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
You know what we'll sort this out?

60
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Science.

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,760
Confusion plus science equals answers.

62
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,080
Let's ask a geologist what a continent is.

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,500
For them, a continent is a tectonic plate, part of the Earth's crust that moved together.

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,820
So geologists, show us your continents.

65
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,380
The Antarctic plate, the Australian plate, the Eurasian plate, the South American plate,

66
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,000
the African plate, so far this is looking pretty good.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,100
The Middle Eastern plate, the Indian plate, the Caribbean plate, the Pacific plate, there

68
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,620
isn't even anything there.

69
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,720
Well there's mostly nothing there.

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,180
The Nazca plate, the Scotia plate, really?

71
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,980
At least North America is still looking reasonable.

72
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,220
Until you include a chunk of Russia, half of Japan, and half of Iceland.

73
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,720
Well this is unhelpful, thanks a lot geologists.

74
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,720
The heart of the problem is that the word continent doesn't have a simple and consistent

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
definition for everyday use.

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,120
So how many continents are there?

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Well, how many do you want there to be?

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,940
Six.

79
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,240
The answer is clearly six.
