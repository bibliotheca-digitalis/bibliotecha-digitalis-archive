0	3200	How many continents are there?
3200	5960	If you grew up in the English-speaking world, you might think that the answer is obvious
5960	8280	– 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
8280	10920	But not everyone counts continents the same way.
10920	14160	The usual definition – that they're large landmasses separated from others by oceans
14160	18220	– is fine until you actually start to think about it and then you run into problems.
18220	19220	Problems like this.
19220	22640	Here's Europe, here's Asia, and you'll notice the lack of ocean between them.
22640	24680	Then why are they two different continents?
24680	28200	The usual reason for this split is a cultural one – that Europe is so different from Asia
28200	30480	that it's best to pretend it's a separate entity.
30480	32280	Okay, maybe.
32280	35720	But if the cultural argument is valid, then surely it also applies to India and the Middle
35720	36720	East.
36720	38580	Now you have nine continents and a new problem.
38580	41960	If culture defines continents, then you'll never stop drawing increasingly unhelpful
41960	42960	lines.
42960	46840	So some places ditch the cultural division and combine Europe and Asia into Eurasia.
46840	49880	This Eurasia is not to be confused with this Eurasia, which has always been at war with
49880	51440	East Asia.
51440	53640	Making Eurasia gives a six-continent view of the world.
53640	54840	But what about over here?
54840	56280	North America and South America?
56360	59800	They're connected to Panama, or at least they used to be until Teddy Roosevelt decided
59800	63140	that someone had to cut that country in half and it might as well be him.
63140	65480	But even still, the canal's only 13 meters deep.
65480	69360	You could walk all the way from northern Alaska across the narrow Panama Canal and, if it
69360	73020	weren't for the deadly, impenetrable, poison-filled Brazilian rainforest, make it all the way
73020	74320	to the southern tip of Chile.
74320	77680	So North and South America, despite the canal, aren't really divided.
77680	82080	Which is why some places, particularly South America, treat America as a single continent,
82080	83080	not two.
83080	85800	Which brings the total number of continents down to five.
85800	90080	But if you disregard the Panama Canal, then you also have to disregard the Suez Canal,
90080	93820	and you've just created the monstrously large Afro-Eurasian continent, 85 million
93820	97200	square kilometers, home to 5.7 billion people.
97200	100200	With this four-continent view of the world, we must surely be done, because there are
100200	104400	no more continents to merge and our definition from the beginning is now consistent.
104400	107900	Except we're not done, because of that troublesome word large.
107900	110360	Exactly how large is continental large?
110360	113600	Is Australia really a dinky continent, or is it king of the islands?
113600	115360	Why not make Greenland the smallest continent?
115360	117720	It's pretty big, even if you took away its ice.
117720	119620	And speaking of ice, what about Antarctica?
119620	122960	The forgotten continent, unfairly smushed against the bottom of maps just because no
122960	124400	one lives there.
124400	127880	Remove the ice sheet that covers Antarctica, and you reveal it for the archipelago it really
127880	130480	is, not the single landmass it pretends to be.
130480	134580	And to complicate matters, the largest of these Antarctic islands is smaller than Australia.
134580	137360	So if you want to keep calling Antarctica a continent, then there's a bunch of other
137360	139920	islands that might want to be continents too.
139920	143680	Islands like New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar, Baffin Islands, Sumatra, and Honshu.
143680	146720	While this seems inclusive to the point of silliness, ultimately someone has to decide
146720	149840	what large means, and that's going to be an arbitrary line.
149840	153420	This problem will be familiar to anyone who remembers the is Pluto a planet or not a planet
153420	157240	fiasco which hinged, mostly, on this same issue of size.
157240	159240	So now we're more confused than before we started.
159240	161640	There might be three continents, or dozens.
161640	163240	You know what we'll sort this out?
163240	164240	Science.
164240	166760	Confusion plus science equals answers.
166760	169080	Let's ask a geologist what a continent is.
169080	173500	For them, a continent is a tectonic plate, part of the Earth's crust that moved together.
173500	175820	So geologists, show us your continents.
175820	179380	The Antarctic plate, the Australian plate, the Eurasian plate, the South American plate,
179380	182000	the African plate, so far this is looking pretty good.
182000	187100	The Middle Eastern plate, the Indian plate, the Caribbean plate, the Pacific plate, there
187100	188620	isn't even anything there.
188620	190720	Well there's mostly nothing there.
190720	193180	The Nazca plate, the Scotia plate, really?
193180	195980	At least North America is still looking reasonable.
195980	199220	Until you include a chunk of Russia, half of Japan, and half of Iceland.
199220	201720	Well this is unhelpful, thanks a lot geologists.
201720	204720	The heart of the problem is that the word continent doesn't have a simple and consistent
204720	206480	definition for everyday use.
206480	208120	So how many continents are there?
208120	209720	Well, how many do you want there to be?
226440	226940	Six.
226940	228240	The answer is clearly six.
