00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
How many continents are there?

00:03.200 --> 00:05.960
If you grew up in the English-speaking world, you might think that the answer is obvious

00:05.960 --> 00:08.280
– 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.920
But not everyone counts continents the same way.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.160
The usual definition – that they're large landmasses separated from others by oceans

00:14.160 --> 00:18.220
– is fine until you actually start to think about it and then you run into problems.

00:18.220 --> 00:19.220
Problems like this.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.640
Here's Europe, here's Asia, and you'll notice the lack of ocean between them.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.680
Then why are they two different continents?

00:24.680 --> 00:28.200
The usual reason for this split is a cultural one – that Europe is so different from Asia

00:28.200 --> 00:30.480
that it's best to pretend it's a separate entity.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.280
Okay, maybe.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.720
But if the cultural argument is valid, then surely it also applies to India and the Middle

00:35.720 --> 00:36.720
East.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.580
Now you have nine continents and a new problem.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.960
If culture defines continents, then you'll never stop drawing increasingly unhelpful

00:41.960 --> 00:42.960
lines.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.840
So some places ditch the cultural division and combine Europe and Asia into Eurasia.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.880
This Eurasia is not to be confused with this Eurasia, which has always been at war with

00:49.880 --> 00:51.440
East Asia.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.640
Making Eurasia gives a six-continent view of the world.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.840
But what about over here?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.280
North America and South America?

00:56.360 --> 00:59.800
They're connected to Panama, or at least they used to be until Teddy Roosevelt decided

00:59.800 --> 01:03.140
that someone had to cut that country in half and it might as well be him.

01:03.140 --> 01:05.480
But even still, the canal's only 13 meters deep.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.360
You could walk all the way from northern Alaska across the narrow Panama Canal and, if it

01:09.360 --> 01:13.020
weren't for the deadly, impenetrable, poison-filled Brazilian rainforest, make it all the way

01:13.020 --> 01:14.320
to the southern tip of Chile.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.680
So North and South America, despite the canal, aren't really divided.

01:17.680 --> 01:22.080
Which is why some places, particularly South America, treat America as a single continent,

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
not two.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.800
Which brings the total number of continents down to five.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.080
But if you disregard the Panama Canal, then you also have to disregard the Suez Canal,

01:30.080 --> 01:33.820
and you've just created the monstrously large Afro-Eurasian continent, 85 million

01:33.820 --> 01:37.200
square kilometers, home to 5.7 billion people.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.200
With this four-continent view of the world, we must surely be done, because there are

01:40.200 --> 01:44.400
no more continents to merge and our definition from the beginning is now consistent.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.900
Except we're not done, because of that troublesome word large.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.360
Exactly how large is continental large?

01:50.360 --> 01:53.600
Is Australia really a dinky continent, or is it king of the islands?

01:53.600 --> 01:55.360
Why not make Greenland the smallest continent?

01:55.360 --> 01:57.720
It's pretty big, even if you took away its ice.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.620
And speaking of ice, what about Antarctica?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.960
The forgotten continent, unfairly smushed against the bottom of maps just because no

02:02.960 --> 02:04.400
one lives there.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.880
Remove the ice sheet that covers Antarctica, and you reveal it for the archipelago it really

02:07.880 --> 02:10.480
is, not the single landmass it pretends to be.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.580
And to complicate matters, the largest of these Antarctic islands is smaller than Australia.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.360
So if you want to keep calling Antarctica a continent, then there's a bunch of other

02:17.360 --> 02:19.920
islands that might want to be continents too.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.680
Islands like New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar, Baffin Islands, Sumatra, and Honshu.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.720
While this seems inclusive to the point of silliness, ultimately someone has to decide

02:26.720 --> 02:29.840
what large means, and that's going to be an arbitrary line.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.420
This problem will be familiar to anyone who remembers the is Pluto a planet or not a planet

02:33.420 --> 02:37.240
fiasco which hinged, mostly, on this same issue of size.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.240
So now we're more confused than before we started.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.640
There might be three continents, or dozens.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.240
You know what we'll sort this out?

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
Science.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.760
Confusion plus science equals answers.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.080
Let's ask a geologist what a continent is.

02:49.080 --> 02:53.500
For them, a continent is a tectonic plate, part of the Earth's crust that moved together.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.820
So geologists, show us your continents.

02:55.820 --> 02:59.380
The Antarctic plate, the Australian plate, the Eurasian plate, the South American plate,

02:59.380 --> 03:02.000
the African plate, so far this is looking pretty good.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.100
The Middle Eastern plate, the Indian plate, the Caribbean plate, the Pacific plate, there

03:07.100 --> 03:08.620
isn't even anything there.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.720
Well there's mostly nothing there.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.180
The Nazca plate, the Scotia plate, really?

03:13.180 --> 03:15.980
At least North America is still looking reasonable.

03:15.980 --> 03:19.220
Until you include a chunk of Russia, half of Japan, and half of Iceland.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.720
Well this is unhelpful, thanks a lot geologists.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.720
The heart of the problem is that the word continent doesn't have a simple and consistent

03:24.720 --> 03:26.480
definition for everyday use.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.120
So how many continents are there?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.720
Well, how many do you want there to be?

03:46.440 --> 03:46.940
Six.

03:46.940 --> 03:48.240
The answer is clearly six.
