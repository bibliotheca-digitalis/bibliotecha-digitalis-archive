0	4640	Stuck at an intersection, you always watch unfold the fundamental problem of traffic.
4640	10880	On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next, and then you,
10880	12680	only to catch the red.
12680	16320	Had the cars accelerated simultaneously, you would have made it through.
16320	19360	Coordination, not cars, is the problem,
19360	24080	because we are monkey drivers with slow reaction times and short attention spans.
24120	30520	Even if we tried, getting everyone to press the pedal on 3, 2, 1, now, would be challenging.
30520	34120	This discoordination limits how many cars can get through an intersection,
34120	40760	and when one backs up to the next, that's when city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear.
40760	44520	In general, more intersections equals more discoordination, which equals more traffic.
44520	46800	This is the motive behind big highways.
46800	47720	No intersections.
47720	49240	Splits and merges, yes.
49240	50480	Intersections, no.
50480	53320	No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic.
53360	54640	Well, that's the theory anyway.
54640	57360	Intersections outside of a highway will back up onto it,
57360	62360	again, because human reaction times limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp when the light changes.
62360	66440	But, even without intersections, there would still be traffic on the highway.
66440	68200	Traffic can just appear.
68200	72560	Take a one-lane highway with happy cars flowing until a chicken crosses the road.
72560	74000	The driver who sees it breaks a little,
74000	77440	the driver behind him doesn't notice immediately and breaks a little harder than necessary,
77440	81160	the driver behind him does the same until someone comes to a complete stop.
81160	85400	And, oh look, cars approaching at highway speeds must now stop as well.
85400	90000	Though the chicken is long gone, it left a phantom intersection on the highway.
90000	92800	This is what's happened when you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking
92800	97560	there must be a deadly pile up ahead and then suddenly the traffic's over with no wreckage in sight.
97560	100640	To your relief, if you're a good person and mild annoyance if you aren't,
100640	104760	you just pass through a phantom intersection, the cause of which is long gone.
104760	107160	And this phantom intersection moves.
107160	110120	It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road,
110120	113480	eating oncoming cars at one end and pooping them out the other.
113480	118840	On a ring road, a single car slowing down will start an eroporous of traffic that will last forever,
118840	121440	even though there's no problem with the road.
121440	125040	If the drivers could coordinate to accelerate and separate simultaneously,
125040	126880	easy driving would return.
126880	129200	But they can't, so traffic eternal.
129200	133040	On highways, traffic snakes grow if cars are eated faster than excreted
133040	135360	and they shrink if excreted faster than eated,
135360	139480	dying when the last car accelerates away before the next car must stop.
139480	142800	Now, in multi-lane highways, there needs be no chicken to start gridlock.
142800	146240	A driver crossing lanes quickly with cars too close behind
146240	149720	is enough to birth a traffic snake that lives for hours in leagues.
149720	154960	It's this quick crossing that causes drivers behind to over-brake and begin a chain reaction.
154960	159560	But we can make traffic snakes less likely by changing the way we drive.
159560	165320	Your goal as a driver is to stay the same distance from the car ahead as from the car behind at all times.
165320	168400	Tailgating is trouble, not just because it makes accidents more likely,
168400	173200	but because you as the tailgater can start a traffic snake if the driver ahead brakes.
173200	174960	Always in the middle.
174960	177200	This gives you the most time to prevent over-braking,
177200	180560	but also gives the driver behind you the most time as well.
180560	186240	And when stuck in traffic, this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster.
186240	190400	That's the simple solution to traffic, getting humans to change their behavior,
190400	193960	perhaps by sharing this video to show how and why traffic happens,
194000	195280	why tailgaters are trouble,
195280	199000	and how we can work together to make the roads better for all.
199000	200520	The end.
200520	201560	Except, yeah.
201560	206640	Wishing upon a star that people are better than they are is a terrible solution every time.
206640	209920	Instead, what works is a structurally systematized solution,
209920	212360	which is exactly what self-driving cars are.
212360	216760	Self-driving cars can just be programmed to stay in the middle and accelerate simultaneously.
216760	217480	They'll just do it.
217480	221320	The more self-driving cars at an intersection, the more efficient the intersection gets.
221320	225840	A solid lane of self-driving cars vastly increases throughput.
225840	229960	Hmm, actually, if you ban humans from the road, which we should totally do anyway,
229960	232320	you can get rid of the intersection entirely.
232320	236040	After all, a traffic light is just a tool for drivers on one road
236040	239600	to communicate with drivers on another, poorly and coarsely.
239600	242400	Red equals don't go now, we are coming through the intersection.
242400	243800	Green equals good to go.
243800	247320	But self-driving cars can talk to each other at the speed of light.
247320	250440	With that kind of coordination, no traffic light necessary.
250440	254600	Just as with a highway, the best intersection is no intersection.
254600	257040	Humans will never drive this precisely.
257040	261200	At the intersection, the fundamental problem with traffic that you watch unfold,
261200	263160	as with everything, is people.
263160	267560	So the real simple solution to traffic is no more monkeys driving cars.
