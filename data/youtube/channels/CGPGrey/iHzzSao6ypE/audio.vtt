00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Stuck at an intersection, you always watch unfold the fundamental problem of traffic.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.880
On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next, and then you,

00:10.880 --> 00:12.680
only to catch the red.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.320
Had the cars accelerated simultaneously, you would have made it through.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.360
Coordination, not cars, is the problem,

00:19.360 --> 00:24.080
because we are monkey drivers with slow reaction times and short attention spans.

00:24.120 --> 00:30.520
Even if we tried, getting everyone to press the pedal on 3, 2, 1, now, would be challenging.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.120
This discoordination limits how many cars can get through an intersection,

00:34.120 --> 00:40.760
and when one backs up to the next, that's when city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.520
In general, more intersections equals more discoordination, which equals more traffic.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.800
This is the motive behind big highways.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.720
No intersections.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.240
Splits and merges, yes.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.480
Intersections, no.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.320
No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.640
Well, that's the theory anyway.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.360
Intersections outside of a highway will back up onto it,

00:57.360 --> 01:02.360
again, because human reaction times limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp when the light changes.

01:02.360 --> 01:06.440
But, even without intersections, there would still be traffic on the highway.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.200
Traffic can just appear.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.560
Take a one-lane highway with happy cars flowing until a chicken crosses the road.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.000
The driver who sees it breaks a little,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.440
the driver behind him doesn't notice immediately and breaks a little harder than necessary,

01:17.440 --> 01:21.160
the driver behind him does the same until someone comes to a complete stop.

01:21.160 --> 01:25.400
And, oh look, cars approaching at highway speeds must now stop as well.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.000
Though the chicken is long gone, it left a phantom intersection on the highway.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.800
This is what's happened when you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking

01:32.800 --> 01:37.560
there must be a deadly pile up ahead and then suddenly the traffic's over with no wreckage in sight.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.640
To your relief, if you're a good person and mild annoyance if you aren't,

01:40.640 --> 01:44.760
you just pass through a phantom intersection, the cause of which is long gone.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.160
And this phantom intersection moves.

01:47.160 --> 01:50.120
It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road,

01:50.120 --> 01:53.480
eating oncoming cars at one end and pooping them out the other.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.840
On a ring road, a single car slowing down will start an eroporous of traffic that will last forever,

01:58.840 --> 02:01.440
even though there's no problem with the road.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.040
If the drivers could coordinate to accelerate and separate simultaneously,

02:05.040 --> 02:06.880
easy driving would return.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.200
But they can't, so traffic eternal.

02:09.200 --> 02:13.040
On highways, traffic snakes grow if cars are eated faster than excreted

02:13.040 --> 02:15.360
and they shrink if excreted faster than eated,

02:15.360 --> 02:19.480
dying when the last car accelerates away before the next car must stop.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.800
Now, in multi-lane highways, there needs be no chicken to start gridlock.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.240
A driver crossing lanes quickly with cars too close behind

02:26.240 --> 02:29.720
is enough to birth a traffic snake that lives for hours in leagues.

02:29.720 --> 02:34.960
It's this quick crossing that causes drivers behind to over-brake and begin a chain reaction.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.560
But we can make traffic snakes less likely by changing the way we drive.

02:39.560 --> 02:45.320
Your goal as a driver is to stay the same distance from the car ahead as from the car behind at all times.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.400
Tailgating is trouble, not just because it makes accidents more likely,

02:48.400 --> 02:53.200
but because you as the tailgater can start a traffic snake if the driver ahead brakes.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.960
Always in the middle.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.200
This gives you the most time to prevent over-braking,

02:57.200 --> 03:00.560
but also gives the driver behind you the most time as well.

03:00.560 --> 03:06.240
And when stuck in traffic, this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.400
That's the simple solution to traffic, getting humans to change their behavior,

03:10.400 --> 03:13.960
perhaps by sharing this video to show how and why traffic happens,

03:14.000 --> 03:15.280
why tailgaters are trouble,

03:15.280 --> 03:19.000
and how we can work together to make the roads better for all.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.520
The end.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.560
Except, yeah.

03:21.560 --> 03:26.640
Wishing upon a star that people are better than they are is a terrible solution every time.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.920
Instead, what works is a structurally systematized solution,

03:29.920 --> 03:32.360
which is exactly what self-driving cars are.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.760
Self-driving cars can just be programmed to stay in the middle and accelerate simultaneously.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.480
They'll just do it.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.320
The more self-driving cars at an intersection, the more efficient the intersection gets.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.840
A solid lane of self-driving cars vastly increases throughput.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.960
Hmm, actually, if you ban humans from the road, which we should totally do anyway,

03:49.960 --> 03:52.320
you can get rid of the intersection entirely.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.040
After all, a traffic light is just a tool for drivers on one road

03:56.040 --> 03:59.600
to communicate with drivers on another, poorly and coarsely.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.400
Red equals don't go now, we are coming through the intersection.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.800
Green equals good to go.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.320
But self-driving cars can talk to each other at the speed of light.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.440
With that kind of coordination, no traffic light necessary.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.600
Just as with a highway, the best intersection is no intersection.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.040
Humans will never drive this precisely.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.200
At the intersection, the fundamental problem with traffic that you watch unfold,

04:21.200 --> 04:23.160
as with everything, is people.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.560
So the real simple solution to traffic is no more monkeys driving cars.
