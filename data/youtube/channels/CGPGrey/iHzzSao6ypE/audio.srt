1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Stuck at an intersection, you always watch unfold the fundamental problem of traffic.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,880
On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next, and then you,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,680
only to catch the red.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,320
Had the cars accelerated simultaneously, you would have made it through.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,360
Coordination, not cars, is the problem,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,080
because we are monkey drivers with slow reaction times and short attention spans.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,520
Even if we tried, getting everyone to press the pedal on 3, 2, 1, now, would be challenging.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,120
This discoordination limits how many cars can get through an intersection,

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,760
and when one backs up to the next, that's when city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,520
In general, more intersections equals more discoordination, which equals more traffic.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,800
This is the motive behind big highways.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,720
No intersections.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,240
Splits and merges, yes.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,480
Intersections, no.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,320
No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,640
Well, that's the theory anyway.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
Intersections outside of a highway will back up onto it,

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,360
again, because human reaction times limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp when the light changes.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,440
But, even without intersections, there would still be traffic on the highway.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,200
Traffic can just appear.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,560
Take a one-lane highway with happy cars flowing until a chicken crosses the road.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
The driver who sees it breaks a little,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,440
the driver behind him doesn't notice immediately and breaks a little harder than necessary,

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,160
the driver behind him does the same until someone comes to a complete stop.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,400
And, oh look, cars approaching at highway speeds must now stop as well.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Though the chicken is long gone, it left a phantom intersection on the highway.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,800
This is what's happened when you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,560
there must be a deadly pile up ahead and then suddenly the traffic's over with no wreckage in sight.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,640
To your relief, if you're a good person and mild annoyance if you aren't,

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,760
you just pass through a phantom intersection, the cause of which is long gone.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,160
And this phantom intersection moves.

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,120
It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road,

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,480
eating oncoming cars at one end and pooping them out the other.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,840
On a ring road, a single car slowing down will start an eroporous of traffic that will last forever,

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,440
even though there's no problem with the road.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,040
If the drivers could coordinate to accelerate and separate simultaneously,

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
easy driving would return.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,200
But they can't, so traffic eternal.

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
On highways, traffic snakes grow if cars are eated faster than excreted

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
and they shrink if excreted faster than eated,

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,480
dying when the last car accelerates away before the next car must stop.

42
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,800
Now, in multi-lane highways, there needs be no chicken to start gridlock.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,240
A driver crossing lanes quickly with cars too close behind

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,720
is enough to birth a traffic snake that lives for hours in leagues.

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,960
It's this quick crossing that causes drivers behind to over-brake and begin a chain reaction.

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,560
But we can make traffic snakes less likely by changing the way we drive.

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Your goal as a driver is to stay the same distance from the car ahead as from the car behind at all times.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,400
Tailgating is trouble, not just because it makes accidents more likely,

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
but because you as the tailgater can start a traffic snake if the driver ahead brakes.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,960
Always in the middle.

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
This gives you the most time to prevent over-braking,

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
but also gives the driver behind you the most time as well.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,240
And when stuck in traffic, this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster.

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,400
That's the simple solution to traffic, getting humans to change their behavior,

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,960
perhaps by sharing this video to show how and why traffic happens,

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
why tailgaters are trouble,

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,000
and how we can work together to make the roads better for all.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
The end.

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,560
Except, yeah.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,640
Wishing upon a star that people are better than they are is a terrible solution every time.

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Instead, what works is a structurally systematized solution,

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,360
which is exactly what self-driving cars are.

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,760
Self-driving cars can just be programmed to stay in the middle and accelerate simultaneously.

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,480
They'll just do it.

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,320
The more self-driving cars at an intersection, the more efficient the intersection gets.

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,840
A solid lane of self-driving cars vastly increases throughput.

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,960
Hmm, actually, if you ban humans from the road, which we should totally do anyway,

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,320
you can get rid of the intersection entirely.

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,040
After all, a traffic light is just a tool for drivers on one road

70
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,600
to communicate with drivers on another, poorly and coarsely.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Red equals don't go now, we are coming through the intersection.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Green equals good to go.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,320
But self-driving cars can talk to each other at the speed of light.

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,440
With that kind of coordination, no traffic light necessary.

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,600
Just as with a highway, the best intersection is no intersection.

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,040
Humans will never drive this precisely.

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,200
At the intersection, the fundamental problem with traffic that you watch unfold,

78
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,160
as with everything, is people.

79
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,560
So the real simple solution to traffic is no more monkeys driving cars.
