0	3700	While riding my bike around London, I stumbled upon this, and was like,
3700	4920	Hehe,
4920	6420	L-O-L, what?
6420	9360	Surprise, sharks raise questions that need answers.
9360	11640	So, once back home to Google, I went,
11640	16040	with a search query that would turn the next six weeks of my life real weird,
16040	21360	with phone calls and legal consultations and hundreds of pages of documentation about zoning.
21360	23640	But it started with I'm Feeling Lucky,
23640	26840	which landed me on a Guardian newspaper article about the sharks.
26840	28520	They're part of an art competition.
28560	31040	Apparently, shark art has a history in England.
31040	32520	Okay, I guess?
32520	36600	But the article said the sharks were next to a warehouse in the London borough of Hackney,
36600	39160	but I found them next to a boat club in Islington.
39160	41320	Well, can't just let a thing like that go.
41320	43760	Oh, uh, hehe, give me a second.
43760	45520	Been at this for a while.
45520	48560	Okay, so, back to Google, where I found Anti-Pavilion,
48560	52880	the warehouse hosting the art competition, with a giant balloon outside?
52880	56080	Okay, don't get distracted, you're here for the shark art competition.
56080	57920	But wait, Hackney Fight?
57920	59000	What's this?
59000	60160	And so it began.
60160	63600	It seemed like, because of the sharks, Hackney Borough was trying to get this
63600	66800	warehouse slash artist studio place shut down.
66800	68880	But the more I read, the weirder it got.
68880	71400	Like this correspondence with the police
71400	76320	about their forced entry into the warehouse to stop a ballet performance?
76320	77200	What?
77200	78520	Okay, too much.
78520	81440	Stop, back back back to the original competition,
81440	83880	which had asked art entrants to consider, quote,
83880	87760	An ambition to expose and question the authoritarian workings of our planning culture
87760	89880	has always been fundamental to Anti-Pavilion.
89880	93160	Entries that respond to the tension between authoritarian governance
93160	95680	of the built environment and aesthetic libertarianism
95680	98240	will be particularly welcomed in the face of the prevailing attempts
98240	100920	by Hackney to close down the Anti-Pavilion Commission.
100920	101760	One entrant?
101760	102440	Sharks!
102440	103080	Five of them.
103080	106560	Full scale, the big one's a megalodon, leaping from the water, singing.
106560	107800	The title of this piece?
107800	108520	Sharks!
108520	109760	With an exclamation mark.
109760	110720	What could compete with that?
110720	113840	Nothing, which is why sharks won and construction began.
113840	117360	Cool, but like, what's the deal with the beef in this brief?
119160	123560	Well, now, weeks later, and after way more hours of stress
123560	125960	than I ever expected from this project,
125960	129240	I can now tell you a very simplified version of what happened
129240	133760	for comprehensibility reasons and legal reasons.
133760	137360	It starts five years ago when Anti-Pavilion held their first art competition
137360	140960	with winner HVAC, a sitting area atop the warehouse roof
140960	142640	from which to admire the canal.
142680	146360	It's disguised, disguised as an air duct
146360	148760	to hide from Hackney and planning permission.
148760	151520	The next year's winner was an inflatable yellow barge.
151520	152560	That's what this is.
152560	154760	Also, did you notice HVAC the first time?
154760	156840	Admit it, you didn't, because it's disguised.
156840	160480	Anyway, the barge inflated so it could be a pop-up transportable venue space
160480	163640	that could deflate and disappear at a moment's notice.
163640	167040	And also so it could fit under London's many tiny canal bridges,
167040	169440	like the ones on either side of the warehouse.
169440	170440	The year after's winner?
170440	171760	I swear this is all connected.
172760	175520	It's just one wall, nothing to see here,
175520	178680	but also serves as the backdrop for a stage on the roof.
178680	182880	It was this last art erection, the opposite of incognito,
182880	185760	that drew the attention of the London borough of Hackney.
185760	188040	Oi, said Hackney, you can't build that here.
188040	189040	What, this?
189040	192720	It's nothing, only the backdrop to some performances we plan on holding.
192720	194320	Do you enjoy ballet?
194320	195040	Not really.
195040	195960	Hey, what's that?
195960	197000	Uh, nothing.
197000	198200	And wait, what's that?
198200	200240	It doesn't look like a code-legal air duct.
200280	202200	Why no, this is HVAC,
202200	205200	a piece that's a playful subversion of planning legislation,
205200	208600	exploiting permitted development rights to confront the habitation of rooftop.
208600	210400	Okay, that's it, enforcement notice.
210400	213640	Pursuant to section 172.2 of the Town and Country Planning Act,
213640	215760	anti-pavilions' unauthorised structures are unacceptable
215760	217400	in terms of their size, location and design,
217400	219440	which adversely affect the surrounding character, appearance
219440	222080	and architectural integrity of the surrounding conservation area
222080	223200	in which they are located.
223200	225360	TLDR, remove yo art.
225360	226640	You have one month.
226640	230120	Thus, these three arts are the history of how the Hackney hatchet
230120	233520	came down, but anti-pavilion didn't remove their art,
233520	236240	instead basing their brief on these events
236240	239360	and picking the purposely provocative sharks as the winner.
239360	242120	Now, as their construction finished and installation approached,
242120	244560	what happened next is debated.
244560	248560	Anti-pavilion says the Guardian approached them to do an article about sharks,
248560	251280	a telephone interview conducted and an article written,
251280	254600	the very article I would find months later after publication.
254600	257360	But pre-publication, according to anti-pavilion,
257360	261200	the article contained defamatory misquotes and deliberate misrepresentations.
261200	265240	Anti-pavilion requested it be changed and wanted a copy of the recorded interview.
265240	268520	The Guardian refused to change anything, didn't comment on the recording,
268520	270800	instead asking for what the misquote was,
270800	273800	leading anti-pavilion to ask for the recording of the interview
273800	275920	and around and around it went.
275920	278640	Anyway, the Guardian's article, which did get published as written
278640	281440	and may or may not have misrepresented anti-pavilion,
281440	284400	may or may not have tipped off the London borough of Hackney
284400	286520	that anti-pavilion was arting again,
286520	290760	soon to install the extremely impossible not to notice sharks.
290760	293600	Hackney packed the paper in their little briefcase to use as evidence
293600	298680	as they ran to a London judge to grant an emergency injunction to stop sharks.
298680	301240	They had to run because that very morning,
301240	303480	the sharks were being loaded into the canal.
303480	305680	One shark in the water.
307680	310040	Two sharks in the water.
312280	314600	Three sharks in the water.
316680	317520	Four shark—
317520	319200	Stop that shark! Injuncted!
319200	320560	Wait, let me see that.
320560	322600	Ooh, this is very confusing.
322600	325480	I need to check with my lawyer about what this means.
325480	327600	Four sharks in the water?
327600	330160	No, seriously. Injuncted.
330160	333240	And thus Hackney blocked the final shark and halted anti-pavilion
333240	337000	from doing anything without express planning permission until further judgment.
337000	339880	Look here, you're in a conservation area, you can't just do what you want.
339880	343960	But four sharks had escaped and the injunction didn't require their removal,
343960	346080	so in the canal they stayed.
346120	349520	While, trapped inside, the final fifth looked on.
349520	353640	Thus, in this moment, the halted sharks became the pitch-perfect presentation
353640	355800	of planning permission versus artistic freedom,
355800	359440	as the paperwork grew from injunctions to witness statements,
359440	363320	permission applications, briefs, reports on the history of art on the site,
363320	366120	what in keeping with the conservation area means,
366120	368760	queries of if sharks block the canal traffic—
368760	370760	Hey, wait, who actually controls the canal?
370760	374760	And arguments about if the very existence of the conservation area is
374800	377920	like an abuse of power? Or a scam?
377920	380600	I have no legal stance here, please don't sue me.
380600	383480	I can't say a tenth of what I've heard, but, well,
383480	386680	the two bridges aren't conserved, the canal is a conservation area,
386680	392640	but the conservation area also happens to swoop up to include this one warehouse.
392640	396400	And it's Hackney who can block a building in a conservation area,
396400	401560	and it's also Hackney that gets to draw where the conservation area is.
401560	405160	I mean, it's a lovely warehouse, but, hmm.
405160	407600	However, the thing is, to anti-pavilion,
407600	412760	all of these literally hundreds and hundreds of pages of legal documentation
412760	418040	and countless human hours of everyone involved in a fight over shark sculpture
418040	420720	are part of the art of sharks itself.
420720	424520	Even the judges dragged into this make comments in their dry way
424520	427240	about what a tangled pain this case is.
427240	430200	Side note, I particularly enjoyed how, since the title of sharks
430200	434200	includes an exclamation mark, so too must all these legal documents,
434200	436280	which was funny every time I read it.
436280	437080	Sharks.
437080	438440	Okay, back to the story.
438440	442600	For months, sharks chilled outside the warehouse while the paperwork rained down,
442600	447000	though Hackney did eventually get them double-injuncted and forced back inside.
447000	450760	Meanwhile, up the canal happens to be the Islington Boat Club,
450760	454360	members of which apparently chugged by sometimes to watch the ballet,
454360	457160	and who developed a soft spot in their heart for sharks,
457160	459720	and they had water rights in their section of the canal,
459720	462520	and so decided to offer their club as a new home.
462520	464600	Anti-pavilion agreed to move the sharks,
464600	467480	contingent on the boat club promising to tell anti-pavilion
467480	470440	about any bureaucratic paperwork problems that might arise.
470440	472520	Are you guys sure you have rights to the water?
472520	475880	As all those future papers would be part of the art of sharks too.
475880	478680	The boat club agreed and the sharks were brought up the canal
478680	480680	to where they currently reside.
480680	484040	Delightfully right in full view of a primary school
484040	486360	that doubtless all the kids there now call shark school,
486360	488440	and right next to a public playground
488440	492840	where sharks is already inspiring the next generation of English shark artists,
492840	496520	and where you too can go see them in their full sharkiness.
496520	499000	But if you do want to see them,
499000	501240	you better hurry while you can.
501240	503720	See, sometime after the relocation,
503720	506520	the Islington Boat Club told anti-pavilion,
506520	508440	look, you need to take your sharks back, mate.
508440	508760	Why?
509320	511000	Uh, we won't tell you.
511000	511800	But why?
511800	515560	And then the boat club ghosted anti-pavilion never to give a reason.
515560	519880	What happened is unknown, but if one were to speculate,
519880	521720	I have no legal stance here, please don't sue me,
521720	526120	the boat club seems underdeveloped for the value of the property it's on,
526120	528600	and the appearance of sharks could have thrust them
528600	531320	into a lot of bureaucratic trouble they weren't expecting
531320	534280	about what exactly their rights to the water are.
534280	535320	But who knows?
535320	536280	Well, the boat club knows,
536280	539560	but they're not saying anything other than time to go, sharks.
539560	542440	They must be removed before the end of this month,
542520	544040	put back into the warehouse,
544040	547400	held behind bars of planning permission paperwork,
547400	549400	never to see the water again.
552840	556600	Although, there's always that barge.
556600	559080	Perhaps sharks could ride again,
559080	562440	technically not in the water, but upon it,
562440	565480	able to travel up and down London's canals,
565480	567000	looking for a new home.
572440	574600	Sharks!
