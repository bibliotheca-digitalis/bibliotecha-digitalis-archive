00:00.000 --> 00:03.700
While riding my bike around London, I stumbled upon this, and was like,

00:03.700 --> 00:04.920
Hehe,

00:04.920 --> 00:06.420
L-O-L, what?

00:06.420 --> 00:09.360
Surprise, sharks raise questions that need answers.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.640
So, once back home to Google, I went,

00:11.640 --> 00:16.040
with a search query that would turn the next six weeks of my life real weird,

00:16.040 --> 00:21.360
with phone calls and legal consultations and hundreds of pages of documentation about zoning.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.640
But it started with I'm Feeling Lucky,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.840
which landed me on a Guardian newspaper article about the sharks.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.520
They're part of an art competition.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.040
Apparently, shark art has a history in England.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.520
Okay, I guess?

00:32.520 --> 00:36.600
But the article said the sharks were next to a warehouse in the London borough of Hackney,

00:36.600 --> 00:39.160
but I found them next to a boat club in Islington.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.320
Well, can't just let a thing like that go.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.760
Oh, uh, hehe, give me a second.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.520
Been at this for a while.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.560
Okay, so, back to Google, where I found Anti-Pavilion,

00:48.560 --> 00:52.880
the warehouse hosting the art competition, with a giant balloon outside?

00:52.880 --> 00:56.080
Okay, don't get distracted, you're here for the shark art competition.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.920
But wait, Hackney Fight?

00:57.920 --> 00:59.000
What's this?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.160
And so it began.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.600
It seemed like, because of the sharks, Hackney Borough was trying to get this

01:03.600 --> 01:06.800
warehouse slash artist studio place shut down.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.880
But the more I read, the weirder it got.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.400
Like this correspondence with the police

01:11.400 --> 01:16.320
about their forced entry into the warehouse to stop a ballet performance?

01:16.320 --> 01:17.200
What?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.520
Okay, too much.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.440
Stop, back back back to the original competition,

01:21.440 --> 01:23.880
which had asked art entrants to consider, quote,

01:23.880 --> 01:27.760
An ambition to expose and question the authoritarian workings of our planning culture

01:27.760 --> 01:29.880
has always been fundamental to Anti-Pavilion.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.160
Entries that respond to the tension between authoritarian governance

01:33.160 --> 01:35.680
of the built environment and aesthetic libertarianism

01:35.680 --> 01:38.240
will be particularly welcomed in the face of the prevailing attempts

01:38.240 --> 01:40.920
by Hackney to close down the Anti-Pavilion Commission.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.760
One entrant?

01:41.760 --> 01:42.440
Sharks!

01:42.440 --> 01:43.080
Five of them.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.560
Full scale, the big one's a megalodon, leaping from the water, singing.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.800
The title of this piece?

01:47.800 --> 01:48.520
Sharks!

01:48.520 --> 01:49.760
With an exclamation mark.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.720
What could compete with that?

01:50.720 --> 01:53.840
Nothing, which is why sharks won and construction began.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.360
Cool, but like, what's the deal with the beef in this brief?

01:59.160 --> 02:03.560
Well, now, weeks later, and after way more hours of stress

02:03.560 --> 02:05.960
than I ever expected from this project,

02:05.960 --> 02:09.240
I can now tell you a very simplified version of what happened

02:09.240 --> 02:13.760
for comprehensibility reasons and legal reasons.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.360
It starts five years ago when Anti-Pavilion held their first art competition

02:17.360 --> 02:20.960
with winner HVAC, a sitting area atop the warehouse roof

02:20.960 --> 02:22.640
from which to admire the canal.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.360
It's disguised, disguised as an air duct

02:26.360 --> 02:28.760
to hide from Hackney and planning permission.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.520
The next year's winner was an inflatable yellow barge.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.560
That's what this is.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.760
Also, did you notice HVAC the first time?

02:34.760 --> 02:36.840
Admit it, you didn't, because it's disguised.

02:36.840 --> 02:40.480
Anyway, the barge inflated so it could be a pop-up transportable venue space

02:40.480 --> 02:43.640
that could deflate and disappear at a moment's notice.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.040
And also so it could fit under London's many tiny canal bridges,

02:47.040 --> 02:49.440
like the ones on either side of the warehouse.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.440
The year after's winner?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.760
I swear this is all connected.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.520
It's just one wall, nothing to see here,

02:55.520 --> 02:58.680
but also serves as the backdrop for a stage on the roof.

02:58.680 --> 03:02.880
It was this last art erection, the opposite of incognito,

03:02.880 --> 03:05.760
that drew the attention of the London borough of Hackney.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.040
Oi, said Hackney, you can't build that here.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
What, this?

03:09.040 --> 03:12.720
It's nothing, only the backdrop to some performances we plan on holding.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.320
Do you enjoy ballet?

03:14.320 --> 03:15.040
Not really.

03:15.040 --> 03:15.960
Hey, what's that?

03:15.960 --> 03:17.000
Uh, nothing.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.200
And wait, what's that?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.240
It doesn't look like a code-legal air duct.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.200
Why no, this is HVAC,

03:22.200 --> 03:25.200
a piece that's a playful subversion of planning legislation,

03:25.200 --> 03:28.600
exploiting permitted development rights to confront the habitation of rooftop.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.400
Okay, that's it, enforcement notice.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.640
Pursuant to section 172.2 of the Town and Country Planning Act,

03:33.640 --> 03:35.760
anti-pavilions' unauthorised structures are unacceptable

03:35.760 --> 03:37.400
in terms of their size, location and design,

03:37.400 --> 03:39.440
which adversely affect the surrounding character, appearance

03:39.440 --> 03:42.080
and architectural integrity of the surrounding conservation area

03:42.080 --> 03:43.200
in which they are located.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.360
TLDR, remove yo art.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.640
You have one month.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.120
Thus, these three arts are the history of how the Hackney hatchet

03:50.120 --> 03:53.520
came down, but anti-pavilion didn't remove their art,

03:53.520 --> 03:56.240
instead basing their brief on these events

03:56.240 --> 03:59.360
and picking the purposely provocative sharks as the winner.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.120
Now, as their construction finished and installation approached,

04:02.120 --> 04:04.560
what happened next is debated.

04:04.560 --> 04:08.560
Anti-pavilion says the Guardian approached them to do an article about sharks,

04:08.560 --> 04:11.280
a telephone interview conducted and an article written,

04:11.280 --> 04:14.600
the very article I would find months later after publication.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.360
But pre-publication, according to anti-pavilion,

04:17.360 --> 04:21.200
the article contained defamatory misquotes and deliberate misrepresentations.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.240
Anti-pavilion requested it be changed and wanted a copy of the recorded interview.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.520
The Guardian refused to change anything, didn't comment on the recording,

04:28.520 --> 04:30.800
instead asking for what the misquote was,

04:30.800 --> 04:33.800
leading anti-pavilion to ask for the recording of the interview

04:33.800 --> 04:35.920
and around and around it went.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.640
Anyway, the Guardian's article, which did get published as written

04:38.640 --> 04:41.440
and may or may not have misrepresented anti-pavilion,

04:41.440 --> 04:44.400
may or may not have tipped off the London borough of Hackney

04:44.400 --> 04:46.520
that anti-pavilion was arting again,

04:46.520 --> 04:50.760
soon to install the extremely impossible not to notice sharks.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.600
Hackney packed the paper in their little briefcase to use as evidence

04:53.600 --> 04:58.680
as they ran to a London judge to grant an emergency injunction to stop sharks.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.240
They had to run because that very morning,

05:01.240 --> 05:03.480
the sharks were being loaded into the canal.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.680
One shark in the water.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.040
Two sharks in the water.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.600
Three sharks in the water.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.520
Four sharkâ€”

05:17.520 --> 05:19.200
Stop that shark! Injuncted!

05:19.200 --> 05:20.560
Wait, let me see that.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.600
Ooh, this is very confusing.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.480
I need to check with my lawyer about what this means.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.600
Four sharks in the water?

05:27.600 --> 05:30.160
No, seriously. Injuncted.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.240
And thus Hackney blocked the final shark and halted anti-pavilion

05:33.240 --> 05:37.000
from doing anything without express planning permission until further judgment.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.880
Look here, you're in a conservation area, you can't just do what you want.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.960
But four sharks had escaped and the injunction didn't require their removal,

05:43.960 --> 05:46.080
so in the canal they stayed.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.520
While, trapped inside, the final fifth looked on.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.640
Thus, in this moment, the halted sharks became the pitch-perfect presentation

05:53.640 --> 05:55.800
of planning permission versus artistic freedom,

05:55.800 --> 05:59.440
as the paperwork grew from injunctions to witness statements,

05:59.440 --> 06:03.320
permission applications, briefs, reports on the history of art on the site,

06:03.320 --> 06:06.120
what in keeping with the conservation area means,

06:06.120 --> 06:08.760
queries of if sharks block the canal trafficâ€”

06:08.760 --> 06:10.760
Hey, wait, who actually controls the canal?

06:10.760 --> 06:14.760
And arguments about if the very existence of the conservation area is

06:14.800 --> 06:17.920
like an abuse of power? Or a scam?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.600
I have no legal stance here, please don't sue me.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.480
I can't say a tenth of what I've heard, but, well,

06:23.480 --> 06:26.680
the two bridges aren't conserved, the canal is a conservation area,

06:26.680 --> 06:32.640
but the conservation area also happens to swoop up to include this one warehouse.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.400
And it's Hackney who can block a building in a conservation area,

06:36.400 --> 06:41.560
and it's also Hackney that gets to draw where the conservation area is.

06:41.560 --> 06:45.160
I mean, it's a lovely warehouse, but, hmm.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.600
However, the thing is, to anti-pavilion,

06:47.600 --> 06:52.760
all of these literally hundreds and hundreds of pages of legal documentation

06:52.760 --> 06:58.040
and countless human hours of everyone involved in a fight over shark sculpture

06:58.040 --> 07:00.720
are part of the art of sharks itself.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.520
Even the judges dragged into this make comments in their dry way

07:04.520 --> 07:07.240
about what a tangled pain this case is.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.200
Side note, I particularly enjoyed how, since the title of sharks

07:10.200 --> 07:14.200
includes an exclamation mark, so too must all these legal documents,

07:14.200 --> 07:16.280
which was funny every time I read it.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.080
Sharks.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.440
Okay, back to the story.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.600
For months, sharks chilled outside the warehouse while the paperwork rained down,

07:22.600 --> 07:27.000
though Hackney did eventually get them double-injuncted and forced back inside.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.760
Meanwhile, up the canal happens to be the Islington Boat Club,

07:30.760 --> 07:34.360
members of which apparently chugged by sometimes to watch the ballet,

07:34.360 --> 07:37.160
and who developed a soft spot in their heart for sharks,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.720
and they had water rights in their section of the canal,

07:39.720 --> 07:42.520
and so decided to offer their club as a new home.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.600
Anti-pavilion agreed to move the sharks,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.480
contingent on the boat club promising to tell anti-pavilion

07:47.480 --> 07:50.440
about any bureaucratic paperwork problems that might arise.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.520
Are you guys sure you have rights to the water?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.880
As all those future papers would be part of the art of sharks too.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.680
The boat club agreed and the sharks were brought up the canal

07:58.680 --> 08:00.680
to where they currently reside.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.040
Delightfully right in full view of a primary school

08:04.040 --> 08:06.360
that doubtless all the kids there now call shark school,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.440
and right next to a public playground

08:08.440 --> 08:12.840
where sharks is already inspiring the next generation of English shark artists,

08:12.840 --> 08:16.520
and where you too can go see them in their full sharkiness.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.000
But if you do want to see them,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.240
you better hurry while you can.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.720
See, sometime after the relocation,

08:23.720 --> 08:26.520
the Islington Boat Club told anti-pavilion,

08:26.520 --> 08:28.440
look, you need to take your sharks back, mate.

08:28.440 --> 08:28.760
Why?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.000
Uh, we won't tell you.

08:31.000 --> 08:31.800
But why?

08:31.800 --> 08:35.560
And then the boat club ghosted anti-pavilion never to give a reason.

08:35.560 --> 08:39.880
What happened is unknown, but if one were to speculate,

08:39.880 --> 08:41.720
I have no legal stance here, please don't sue me,

08:41.720 --> 08:46.120
the boat club seems underdeveloped for the value of the property it's on,

08:46.120 --> 08:48.600
and the appearance of sharks could have thrust them

08:48.600 --> 08:51.320
into a lot of bureaucratic trouble they weren't expecting

08:51.320 --> 08:54.280
about what exactly their rights to the water are.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.320
But who knows?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.280
Well, the boat club knows,

08:56.280 --> 08:59.560
but they're not saying anything other than time to go, sharks.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.440
They must be removed before the end of this month,

09:02.520 --> 09:04.040
put back into the warehouse,

09:04.040 --> 09:07.400
held behind bars of planning permission paperwork,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.400
never to see the water again.

09:12.840 --> 09:16.600
Although, there's always that barge.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.080
Perhaps sharks could ride again,

09:19.080 --> 09:22.440
technically not in the water, but upon it,

09:22.440 --> 09:25.480
able to travel up and down London's canals,

09:25.480 --> 09:27.000
looking for a new home.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.600
Sharks!
