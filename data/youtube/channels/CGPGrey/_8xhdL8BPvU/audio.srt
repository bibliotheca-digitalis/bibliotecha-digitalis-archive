1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
While riding my bike around London, I stumbled upon this, and was like,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,920
Hehe,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,420
L-O-L, what?

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,360
Surprise, sharks raise questions that need answers.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,640
So, once back home to Google, I went,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,040
with a search query that would turn the next six weeks of my life real weird,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,360
with phone calls and legal consultations and hundreds of pages of documentation about zoning.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,640
But it started with I'm Feeling Lucky,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,840
which landed me on a Guardian newspaper article about the sharks.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,520
They're part of an art competition.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,040
Apparently, shark art has a history in England.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,520
Okay, I guess?

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
But the article said the sharks were next to a warehouse in the London borough of Hackney,

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,160
but I found them next to a boat club in Islington.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,320
Well, can't just let a thing like that go.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,760
Oh, uh, hehe, give me a second.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,520
Been at this for a while.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,560
Okay, so, back to Google, where I found Anti-Pavilion,

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,880
the warehouse hosting the art competition, with a giant balloon outside?

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,080
Okay, don't get distracted, you're here for the shark art competition.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,920
But wait, Hackney Fight?

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,000
What's this?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,160
And so it began.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
It seemed like, because of the sharks, Hackney Borough was trying to get this

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,800
warehouse slash artist studio place shut down.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,880
But the more I read, the weirder it got.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,400
Like this correspondence with the police

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,320
about their forced entry into the warehouse to stop a ballet performance?

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,200
What?

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
Okay, too much.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,440
Stop, back back back to the original competition,

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,880
which had asked art entrants to consider, quote,

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,760
An ambition to expose and question the authoritarian workings of our planning culture

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,880
has always been fundamental to Anti-Pavilion.

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,160
Entries that respond to the tension between authoritarian governance

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,680
of the built environment and aesthetic libertarianism

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,240
will be particularly welcomed in the face of the prevailing attempts

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,920
by Hackney to close down the Anti-Pavilion Commission.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
One entrant?

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,440
Sharks!

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,080
Five of them.

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,560
Full scale, the big one's a megalodon, leaping from the water, singing.

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,800
The title of this piece?

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,520
Sharks!

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,760
With an exclamation mark.

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
What could compete with that?

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
Nothing, which is why sharks won and construction began.

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,360
Cool, but like, what's the deal with the beef in this brief?

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,560
Well, now, weeks later, and after way more hours of stress

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,960
than I ever expected from this project,

51
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,240
I can now tell you a very simplified version of what happened

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,760
for comprehensibility reasons and legal reasons.

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
It starts five years ago when Anti-Pavilion held their first art competition

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,960
with winner HVAC, a sitting area atop the warehouse roof

55
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,640
from which to admire the canal.

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,360
It's disguised, disguised as an air duct

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,760
to hide from Hackney and planning permission.

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,520
The next year's winner was an inflatable yellow barge.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
That's what this is.

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,760
Also, did you notice HVAC the first time?

61
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,840
Admit it, you didn't, because it's disguised.

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,480
Anyway, the barge inflated so it could be a pop-up transportable venue space

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,640
that could deflate and disappear at a moment's notice.

64
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,040
And also so it could fit under London's many tiny canal bridges,

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
like the ones on either side of the warehouse.

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
The year after's winner?

67
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,760
I swear this is all connected.

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,520
It's just one wall, nothing to see here,

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,680
but also serves as the backdrop for a stage on the roof.

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,880
It was this last art erection, the opposite of incognito,

71
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,760
that drew the attention of the London borough of Hackney.

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,040
Oi, said Hackney, you can't build that here.

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
What, this?

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,720
It's nothing, only the backdrop to some performances we plan on holding.

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,320
Do you enjoy ballet?

76
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
Not really.

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,960
Hey, what's that?

78
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,000
Uh, nothing.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
And wait, what's that?

80
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,240
It doesn't look like a code-legal air duct.

81
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Why no, this is HVAC,

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
a piece that's a playful subversion of planning legislation,

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,600
exploiting permitted development rights to confront the habitation of rooftop.

84
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Okay, that's it, enforcement notice.

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,640
Pursuant to section 172.2 of the Town and Country Planning Act,

86
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,760
anti-pavilions' unauthorised structures are unacceptable

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,400
in terms of their size, location and design,

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,440
which adversely affect the surrounding character, appearance

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
and architectural integrity of the surrounding conservation area

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,200
in which they are located.

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
TLDR, remove yo art.

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
You have one month.

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,120
Thus, these three arts are the history of how the Hackney hatchet

94
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,520
came down, but anti-pavilion didn't remove their art,

95
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,240
instead basing their brief on these events

96
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,360
and picking the purposely provocative sharks as the winner.

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,120
Now, as their construction finished and installation approached,

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,560
what happened next is debated.

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Anti-pavilion says the Guardian approached them to do an article about sharks,

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
a telephone interview conducted and an article written,

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,600
the very article I would find months later after publication.

102
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,360
But pre-publication, according to anti-pavilion,

103
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,200
the article contained defamatory misquotes and deliberate misrepresentations.

104
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,240
Anti-pavilion requested it be changed and wanted a copy of the recorded interview.

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,520
The Guardian refused to change anything, didn't comment on the recording,

106
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,800
instead asking for what the misquote was,

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
leading anti-pavilion to ask for the recording of the interview

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,920
and around and around it went.

109
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Anyway, the Guardian's article, which did get published as written

110
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,440
and may or may not have misrepresented anti-pavilion,

111
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
may or may not have tipped off the London borough of Hackney

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,520
that anti-pavilion was arting again,

113
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,760
soon to install the extremely impossible not to notice sharks.

114
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,600
Hackney packed the paper in their little briefcase to use as evidence

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,680
as they ran to a London judge to grant an emergency injunction to stop sharks.

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,240
They had to run because that very morning,

117
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,480
the sharks were being loaded into the canal.

118
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,680
One shark in the water.

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,040
Two sharks in the water.

120
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,600
Three sharks in the water.

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Four shark—

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
Stop that shark! Injuncted!

123
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,560
Wait, let me see that.

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,600
Ooh, this is very confusing.

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,480
I need to check with my lawyer about what this means.

126
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,600
Four sharks in the water?

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
No, seriously. Injuncted.

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,240
And thus Hackney blocked the final shark and halted anti-pavilion

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,000
from doing anything without express planning permission until further judgment.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Look here, you're in a conservation area, you can't just do what you want.

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,960
But four sharks had escaped and the injunction didn't require their removal,

132
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,080
so in the canal they stayed.

133
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,520
While, trapped inside, the final fifth looked on.

134
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,640
Thus, in this moment, the halted sharks became the pitch-perfect presentation

135
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,800
of planning permission versus artistic freedom,

136
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,440
as the paperwork grew from injunctions to witness statements,

137
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,320
permission applications, briefs, reports on the history of art on the site,

138
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,120
what in keeping with the conservation area means,

139
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,760
queries of if sharks block the canal traffic—

140
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Hey, wait, who actually controls the canal?

141
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,760
And arguments about if the very existence of the conservation area is

142
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,920
like an abuse of power? Or a scam?

143
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,600
I have no legal stance here, please don't sue me.

144
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,480
I can't say a tenth of what I've heard, but, well,

145
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,680
the two bridges aren't conserved, the canal is a conservation area,

146
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,640
but the conservation area also happens to swoop up to include this one warehouse.

147
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,400
And it's Hackney who can block a building in a conservation area,

148
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,560
and it's also Hackney that gets to draw where the conservation area is.

149
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,160
I mean, it's a lovely warehouse, but, hmm.

150
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,600
However, the thing is, to anti-pavilion,

151
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,760
all of these literally hundreds and hundreds of pages of legal documentation

152
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,040
and countless human hours of everyone involved in a fight over shark sculpture

153
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,720
are part of the art of sharks itself.

154
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Even the judges dragged into this make comments in their dry way

155
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,240
about what a tangled pain this case is.

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,200
Side note, I particularly enjoyed how, since the title of sharks

157
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,200
includes an exclamation mark, so too must all these legal documents,

158
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,280
which was funny every time I read it.

159
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,080
Sharks.

160
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay, back to the story.

161
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,600
For months, sharks chilled outside the warehouse while the paperwork rained down,

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,000
though Hackney did eventually get them double-injuncted and forced back inside.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,760
Meanwhile, up the canal happens to be the Islington Boat Club,

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,360
members of which apparently chugged by sometimes to watch the ballet,

165
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,160
and who developed a soft spot in their heart for sharks,

166
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,720
and they had water rights in their section of the canal,

167
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,520
and so decided to offer their club as a new home.

168
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Anti-pavilion agreed to move the sharks,

169
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,480
contingent on the boat club promising to tell anti-pavilion

170
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,440
about any bureaucratic paperwork problems that might arise.

171
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,520
Are you guys sure you have rights to the water?

172
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,880
As all those future papers would be part of the art of sharks too.

173
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,680
The boat club agreed and the sharks were brought up the canal

174
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
to where they currently reside.

175
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,040
Delightfully right in full view of a primary school

176
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,360
that doubtless all the kids there now call shark school,

177
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,440
and right next to a public playground

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,840
where sharks is already inspiring the next generation of English shark artists,

179
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,520
and where you too can go see them in their full sharkiness.

180
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,000
But if you do want to see them,

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,240
you better hurry while you can.

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,720
See, sometime after the relocation,

183
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,520
the Islington Boat Club told anti-pavilion,

184
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,440
look, you need to take your sharks back, mate.

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,760
Why?

186
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,000
Uh, we won't tell you.

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
But why?

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,560
And then the boat club ghosted anti-pavilion never to give a reason.

189
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,880
What happened is unknown, but if one were to speculate,

190
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,720
I have no legal stance here, please don't sue me,

191
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,120
the boat club seems underdeveloped for the value of the property it's on,

192
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,600
and the appearance of sharks could have thrust them

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,320
into a lot of bureaucratic trouble they weren't expecting

194
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,280
about what exactly their rights to the water are.

195
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,320
But who knows?

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,280
Well, the boat club knows,

197
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,560
but they're not saying anything other than time to go, sharks.

198
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,440
They must be removed before the end of this month,

199
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,040
put back into the warehouse,

200
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,400
held behind bars of planning permission paperwork,

201
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
never to see the water again.

202
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,600
Although, there's always that barge.

203
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,080
Perhaps sharks could ride again,

204
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,440
technically not in the water, but upon it,

205
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,480
able to travel up and down London's canals,

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,000
looking for a new home.

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,600
Sharks!
