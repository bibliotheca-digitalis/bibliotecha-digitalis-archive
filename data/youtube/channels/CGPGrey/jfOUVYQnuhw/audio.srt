1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
There are thousands of airports connecting cities, cross-countries and continents,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,720
yet with just three letters from AAC and BBI to YYZ and ZZU,

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,980
both me and you and our bags root round the world as unambiguously as practically possible.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,100
Airport codes!

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,020
If you fly, you know them as part of the planning on your tickets, trackers and tags,

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,320
and even as part of the port itself as big big branding.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,580
It's impossible not to wonder bored on a long haul with only in-flight entertainment

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,120
about potential patterns peeking through, like all the Canadian Y airports.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,500
Why Canada? And why everyone?

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,180
How do all these codes code?

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,840
Well, neighbour, to find the answer we need to divert this flight to YUL,

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,100
the Canadian city that's capital of codes, Montreal, where is headquartered IATA,

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,720
the International Air Transport Association.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,900
It's not a governmental organization, more an independent aviation agency for airlines,

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,320
where they work to make airports and airplanes increasingly interoperable,

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,740
using humanity's most exciting and powerful yet oft-maligned-as-dull tool, standards.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,900
One of which is the IATA airport code, three letters to identify every airport in the world,

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,700
from the most connected to the least.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,340
All are coded so companies can communicate clearly and concisely complicated connections

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,700
to carry their customers and their bags.

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,040
And actually, the code IATA created isn't only for airports,

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,960
rather technically it's a location code for all kinds of transportation interchanges,

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,780
like plane stations that connect to train stations such as Amsterdam Shipple,

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,660
which is just so intermodally epic.

25
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,220
Okay, let's try not to get distracted by efficient infrastructure, easier said than done.

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,860
Here's how the IATA code is supposed to work.

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,800
One airport, one code, which is unique because airport names are not.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,300
Booking passage to Portland?

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Cool, that could be Oregon or Maine or Victoria, Australia.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,060
Ambiguity is the enemy.

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,460
International flying creates communication connections between every language on Earth.

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,640
So the IATA code helps when you don't speak Greenlandic or Odia,

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,280
but still need to book a flight to Kangerlussac via Bainswar?

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm so sorry Greenland and India.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,400
Instead of mongoling pronunciation, it's just SFJ via BBI.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Much clearer, not just for you, but also for the ground crew getting the bags through.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,520
Ideally, the IATA code comes from the first three letters of the location,

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,280
like with Gibraltar, where Gibraltar airport is given GIB.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,480
Gib, Gibraltar.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,060
So going to Cork, it'll be C-O-R, Coir, Ireland.

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,360
Oh, that didn't work.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,620
Seems CÃ³rdoba, Argentina built their airport first and got C-O-R ahead of Cork,

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,340
so, uh, Ork for Cork.

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,480
Tufnugi's Ork, Germany, that's an adorable town name you've got there,

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,020
but you're going to need to pick something else for your code.

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,320
Thus, a single code collision kicks off a consistency cascade

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
as airports compete for clear codes.

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,880
So if your local airport has an odd three letters,

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,720
there's probably a rival port that picked previously.

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,080
This is one of the major things IATA does.

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,180
Coordinate everyone's code preferences,

52
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,040
which means dealing with not just individual airports,

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,180
but all the aviation agencies in different countries,

54
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,660
some with their own desires for intra-country code consistency,

55
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,560
such as Canada, who clearly claimed all the Y's.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,180
Thus picking a Y1 at random, at least you know roughly where you're going to go.

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,060
Oops, no, that didn't work.

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,540
YKM brought us to Washington, USA,

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,020
and since we're here, we might as well talk about the FAA.

60
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,620
In America, the Federal Aviation Administration,

61
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,120
daughter of the Department of Transportation,

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,340
is given the job of assigning all American airports an American airport code.

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,260
Yes, the FAA actually has her own set of three letter codes,

64
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,780
but we're not going to talk about it,

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,900
because it means in America there's one airport, two codes,

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,300
and for simplicity, I'm sticking to this story.

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
One airport, one code.

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,040
Right?

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,860
Right.

70
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,740
Now, FAA has letters she'd really rather American airports not.

71
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,940
Please know N, Q, W, K, Z, or Y.

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,620
N is reserved for the Navy, for OMG, is it aircraft carriers?

73
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,100
No, they use an unrelated and additional system,

74
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,460
that we're also not going to talk about.

75
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,740
The Navy N is given to Navy bases with airports.

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,500
So American airports, like Nashville, that seem like they should start with the letter N,

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,940
were encouraged to pick something else, like B, for Banashville.

78
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,700
There is also A for the Army and the Air Force, although not all the A's,

79
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,260
so there's a bunch of A airports, like Albuquerque, Aberdeen, Anchorage, Amarillo, and Augusta.

80
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,740
Next, Q, FAA once avoided because of,

81
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,180
checks, notes, Morse code?

82
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,420
Wow, really?

83
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,380
There's a set of three letter international Morse codes that begin with Q,

84
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,860
for quickie communications, that are still used, I guess?

85
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,220
So, because of 1800's telegraph slang,

86
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,340
American airports shouldn't start with the letter Q.

87
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,820
Next, K and W, FAA advises against,

88
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,420
because FCC, the Federal Communications Commission,

89
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,460
daughter of no one, she's an independent agency,

90
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,180
assigns K and W for US civilian broadcast stations.

91
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,380
So, that thing where on the radio they say,

92
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,860
K-MAD, Action News, or WDUL, Public Airwaves.

93
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,980
Yeah, they all start with a K or W, which is actually location information.

94
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,580
K's are in the west, and W's in the east,

95
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,940
except for the middle, where it's both.

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,460
FCC, why did you do it this way?

97
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,500
Well, since you coded those codes first,

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,780
FAA discourages airports from starting with those letters.

99
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,940
Even though broadcast codes are four letters, not three,

100
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,300
and they're, you know, radio stations, not airports,

101
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,540
and definitely not weather stations.

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,860
Of course they're not weather stations, why would you even say that?

103
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,780
No reason, it won't come up later, don't worry.

104
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,540
Moving on, Z is reserved for air route traffic control centers themselves,

105
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,940
and why no why?

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,460
Because Canada, of course.

107
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,740
Yes, I understand, that's not an explanation, we'll get to it later.

108
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,220
That's America's preferences for airport codes,

109
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,060
but other countries exist,

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,780
and their aviation agencies don't care at all which letters the United States avoids,

111
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,860
so while Bonashville was building her big-big branding,

112
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,300
Nassau grabbed the N to get NAS for the Bahamian capital.

113
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,020
There's no shortage of airport codes that start outside the US with America's reluctant letters.

114
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,460
And also, because FAA's precedents aren't laws,

115
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,180
you can find American exceptions, like New Kekwa, Yakquig, and Ziv.

116
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,140
Boy, that was fun to say, let's end the video with more of that, shall we?

117
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,540
And that new must particularly burn Newark, New Jersey,

118
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,460
who had to go with Ewerk, U Jersey instead.

119
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,700
Right, finishing this thought,

120
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,140
every country and their agencies has their own wacky preferences for letters

121
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,980
and wants to ignore every other country's preferences,

122
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,740
and IATA's job is to coordinate between them.

123
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,860
The result of which is,

124
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,260
IATA airport codes have no satisfying system at all,

125
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,300
which is so sad for a standard.

126
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,180
And the story of one airport, one code,

127
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,780
also falls apart even within IATA,

128
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,620
because of mega codes for megacities.

129
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,460
Example, London, which has six international airports,

130
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,740
Heathrow, Gatwick City, Luton, Stansted, Southend,

131
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,940
LHR, LGW, LCY, LTN,

132
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,140
oh, they all start with L?

133
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,260
No, STN, SEN.

134
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,620
But there's a mega code for them all, LON,

135
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,500
which you can use while searching for flights landing in London,

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,820
but don't care where.

137
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,780
Even though these airports are ages apart.

138
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,780
LON is the International City, Mega Ist, Mega Code,

139
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,700
but there's also Moscow, MOW, and Stockholm STO

140
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,060
with four airports each,

141
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,220
and more with two or three, like NYC and BUE.

142
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,380
And then, code-wise, is the most exceptional airport.

143
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,420
Euro Airport, Basel, Mulhouse, Freiburg.

144
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,820
An airport so nice, they coded it thrice.

145
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,620
MLH, BSL, EAP.

146
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,700
How this happened is,

147
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,780
France and Switzerland both wanted an airport here-ish,

148
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,740
near the German border, and teamed up.

149
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,060
France provided the land, Switzerland the capital,

150
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,580
Germany has nothing to do with this,

151
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,260
and the pair co-built the port,

152
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,620
constructing duplicate and separate everythings.

153
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,820
So it was, effectively, two airports,

154
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,060
run by two countries, with two runways,

155
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,340
and two sets of rules, and thus needed two airport codes,

156
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,180
depending on which side passengers could connect through,

157
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,660
and one mega code if it didn't matter.

158
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,500
But all of this doesn't mega matter now,

159
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,580
because the two airports mostly act as one anyway,

160
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,740
thus one airport, three codes.

161
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,700
And there are plans to run a railway through

162
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,100
for epic intermodalness,

163
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,340
so it could become one airport, four codes, or five codes.

164
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,140
I mean, why not at this point?

165
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,140
So yeah, an airport isn't uniquely identified by one code,

166
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,740
and there's no location information

167
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,860
coded in this location code?

168
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,660
Not even a checksum letter?

169
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,620
What is this, a social security number?

170
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,740
Without a checksum, if you were planning a flight

171
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,940
to CGP Airport in Bangladesh, but typo the incorrect CPG,

172
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,260
you'll end up in Argentina instead.

173
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,100
Again.

174
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,340
But at least the chance of a switcheroo like that

175
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,540
must be pretty small.

176
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,900
After all, a three letter code means 17,000 permutations,

177
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,580
way more than the actual number of airports,

178
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,500
which is only 40,000 airports worldwide?

179
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,060
How can that possibly be true?

180
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,940
Well, it's time to introduce you to IKO,

181
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,700
the International Civil Aviation Organization,

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,060
daughter of the United Nations,

183
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,500
who also lives in Montreal with IATA.

184
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,420
And it might seem like they're the same,

185
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,020
but IATA actually only covers what we might call

186
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,980
the standard commercial airports

187
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,980
you'd find searching for flights normally.

188
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,900
While IKO covers what she calls aerodromes,

189
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,340
which is everything from the world's busiest

190
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,940
passenger airport in the always unlikely seeming

191
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,300
Atlanta, Georgia, down to rarely used runways

192
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,700
on ranches in Texas,

193
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,900
of which there are an absolutely absurd number.

194
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,220
So with all those aerodromes to account for,

195
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,900
IKO uses four letters, which gives, wow,

196
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,620
a lot more options, thanks Exponentials.

197
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,860
And she also uses the extra space

198
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,220
to add location information.

199
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,100
Finally, in IKO's system,

200
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,860
the first letter of an airport code

201
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
is roughly where on earth it is.

202
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,340
P is for airports in the Pacific,

203
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,700
one letter to cover flying over

204
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,580
the most terrifyingly empty half of the earth.

205
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,100
Try not to think about it as you look down

206
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,140
into the endless abyss before arriving at South America.

207
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,900
S, then M for middle America

208
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,980
and K for continental America.

209
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,500
C sensibly is Canadian America

210
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,820
and flying over the pole we get to U,

211
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,940
for used to be USSR.

212
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,420
Yes, that's actually the name.

213
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,180
Look, what makes standard standards is their stubbornness.

214
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,420
Just because a gigantic country collapsed

215
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,460
is no reason to change what millions of flight computers

216
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,900
know in their code and pilots in their brains.

217
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,180
After IKO's first letter,

218
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,340
there's also a bunch of second sub-letters.

219
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,060
Well, except for America and Canada,

220
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,180
who skipped that, but don't worry.

221
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,460
Moving on, as an example,

222
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,940
if your airport starts with an F, it's in Southern Africa.

223
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,260
And if the next letter is A, that's South Africa.

224
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,500
And the last two letters are for the airport.

225
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,140
So Cape Town gets CT for a fact.

226
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,740
Of course, there are some exceptions like Antarctica,

227
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,060
the continent no one owns,

228
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,740
but all the cool kids want to claim.

229
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,820
Aerodromes here are supposed to use the code

230
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,540
for the country's claim they're in,

231
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,100
such as Williams Field, which is American run,

232
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,980
but uses NZWD because it's in the Kiwi claim.

233
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,500
But also lots of Antarctic aerodromes use pseudocodes.

234
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,980
No, we're not gonna talk about what that means,

235
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,260
which start with a T and end with a number like 27

236
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,900
for Troll Airfield serving Troll Research Station,

237
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,380
which runs on troll time.

238
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,100
Norway, is that you?

239
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,220
I knew it was.

240
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,380
But you really should be using EN for Europe, Norway.

241
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,980
And TR is free.

242
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,940
Enter trolls, it's so perfect.

243
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,220
And yes, the 27 means there are at least 26 other runways

244
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,740
in Antarctica, I was surprised too,

245
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,300
but this along with all of the ranches

246
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,500
is how you get to crazy numbers of aerodromes.

247
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,620
And yes, ICAO has more exceptions to this system

248
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,900
that we're going to skip,

249
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,140
but I can't resist just one more,

250
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,220
which is Region J.

251
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,300
Looking at the map, you won't be able to find it

252
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,900
because J is Mars.

253
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,340
When the rover arrived at Jezero Crater,

254
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,740
ICAO gave the historic landing location the code JZRO.

255
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,220
Okay, but that's it for exceptions.

256
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,380
So to sum up, the story of one airport, one code

257
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,860
was just that, a story.

258
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,820
Tons of airports have at least two.

259
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,180
And when they do, the ICAO code

260
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,820
is what computers and pilots know

261
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,620
to plan where the plane needs to go.

262
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,780
And IATA is what passengers say to get on their way.

263
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,780
But if ICAO exists with a more comprehensive code,

264
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,740
why is IATA at all?

265
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,980
So IATA isn't about you, it's about your bags.

266
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,580
At an airport, you as a human walk to your connecting flight

267
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,140
but your bags below need a lot of logistical assistance.

268
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,860
Before IATA, there was just like a handwritten tag saying,

269
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,820
please get me where my owner is going,

270
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,900
written in potentially every language on earth.

271
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
So you can imagine how often that went wrong.

272
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,260
So IATA used codes to make life better for bags

273
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,540
with bag tags, with big clear codes

274
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,980
to get those bags cleanly through connections

275
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,940
across countries and companies.

276
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,280
And the original plan was that train stations

277
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,380
with IATA codes would also let you check in your bag there

278
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,860
and it would be part of the automatic connection too.

279
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,180
But that mostly doesn't happen now

280
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,940
because of logistical difficulties,

281
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,460
which is the same reason that the IATA code is a club

282
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,940
that excludes all the little aerodromes

283
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,860
too annoying to attend to.

284
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,480
So if your bag's final destination after connecting

285
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,020
at Austin is one of the many random ranch airstrips,

286
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,780
the ground crew is not going to swap your bags

287
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,220
onto the tiny crop duster for you.

288
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,500
Ditto if you're connecting through Argentina

289
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,380
to Antarctica, anywhere.

290
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,260
Those tiny airports, no IATA code for you.

291
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,520
And without an IATA code, your bag depends on you

292
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,420
to get it all the way through.

293
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,040
And that's what IATA is actually for.

294
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,320
That big, big branding you see is for your bags.

295
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,840
And because of the tag, it became what customers know,

296
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,720
which brings us back to the start.

297
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,400
And oh, sorry, Canada.

298
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,740
I know I've been avoiding answering the whys,

299
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,240
but it's just so much more complicated than expected.

300
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,220
There's a tale that the whys are an old system

301
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,000
for if Canadian airports had a weather station.

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,280
Y for yes, weather station and W without.

303
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,600
And since pilots want to know the weather,

304
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,360
that explains all the whys,

305
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,520
but also the few oddball Canadian Ws.

306
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,580
But investigating the truth of that story

307
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,140
took eight months of my life,

308
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,960
which I will now give to you

309
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,200
as an extremely compressed executive summary.

310
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,340
Working backwards, the American and Canadian IATA codes

311
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,400
created in the 1950s come from the last three letters

312
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,080
of ICAO codes created in the 1940s.

313
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,360
The first letter of ICAO codes come from the ITU,

314
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,140
the International Telecommunications Union's codes

315
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,320
created in the 1910s for radio stations,

316
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,640
which used K for America and CY for Canada.

317
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,320
So K and CY into four letters

318
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,360
and back down to three leaves Y for Canada.

319
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,160
Here is where you would reasonably ask why CY for Canada,

320
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,480
but that goes all the way back to telegraphs and beyond,

321
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,440
so is a story for another time.

322
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,980
But for now, for this video, why Y for Canada?

323
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,880
Because of radio call signs,

324
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,060
because of a lot of other things,

325
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,280
because of US and Canada coordinating

326
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,840
that four flights within North America,

327
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,820
it really would be Y for yes, Canada, mostly.

328
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,440
Well, that was a lot of bureaucratic history,

329
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,720
so let's finish with the final fun IATA codes

330
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,960
promised from before, starting with Sioux City

331
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,800
with the sensible-looking SUX until you say it out loud,

332
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,500
but to her credit totally owns

333
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,160
that branding for airport merch.

334
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Good for you, Sioux.

335
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
And there's also Beaches International Airport,

336
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Summer Break Central.

337
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,200
Their top two picks for codes were picked,

338
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,540
so to help the confused collegiates find their connections,

339
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,320
the agencies agreed on ECP to stand for Everyone Can Party,

340
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,880
which is awesome branding,

341
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,980
but you'd never know because Beaches doesn't bother.

342
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,360
Jeez, ECP, you could learn a thing or two from Sioux.

343
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,880
But now everyone can party

344
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,360
on this round-the-world flight of IATA codes

345
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,240
entertaining to say out loud.

346
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,080
Ready?
