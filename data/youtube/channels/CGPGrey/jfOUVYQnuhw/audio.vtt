00:00.000 --> 00:03.820
There are thousands of airports connecting cities, cross-countries and continents,

00:03.820 --> 00:08.720
yet with just three letters from AAC and BBI to YYZ and ZZU,

00:08.720 --> 00:13.980
both me and you and our bags root round the world as unambiguously as practically possible.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.100
Airport codes!

00:15.100 --> 00:19.020
If you fly, you know them as part of the planning on your tickets, trackers and tags,

00:19.020 --> 00:22.320
and even as part of the port itself as big big branding.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.580
It's impossible not to wonder bored on a long haul with only in-flight entertainment

00:26.580 --> 00:31.120
about potential patterns peeking through, like all the Canadian Y airports.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.500
Why Canada? And why everyone?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.180
How do all these codes code?

00:35.180 --> 00:39.840
Well, neighbour, to find the answer we need to divert this flight to YUL,

00:39.840 --> 00:44.100
the Canadian city that's capital of codes, Montreal, where is headquartered IATA,

00:44.100 --> 00:46.720
the International Air Transport Association.

00:46.720 --> 00:52.900
It's not a governmental organization, more an independent aviation agency for airlines,

00:52.900 --> 00:56.320
where they work to make airports and airplanes increasingly interoperable,

00:56.320 --> 01:01.740
using humanity's most exciting and powerful yet oft-maligned-as-dull tool, standards.

01:01.740 --> 01:06.900
One of which is the IATA airport code, three letters to identify every airport in the world,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.700
from the most connected to the least.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.340
All are coded so companies can communicate clearly and concisely complicated connections

01:14.340 --> 01:16.700
to carry their customers and their bags.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.040
And actually, the code IATA created isn't only for airports,

01:20.040 --> 01:24.960
rather technically it's a location code for all kinds of transportation interchanges,

01:24.960 --> 01:28.780
like plane stations that connect to train stations such as Amsterdam Shipple,

01:28.780 --> 01:31.660
which is just so intermodally epic.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.220
Okay, let's try not to get distracted by efficient infrastructure, easier said than done.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.860
Here's how the IATA code is supposed to work.

01:37.860 --> 01:42.800
One airport, one code, which is unique because airport names are not.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.300
Booking passage to Portland?

01:44.300 --> 01:48.300
Cool, that could be Oregon or Maine or Victoria, Australia.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.060
Ambiguity is the enemy.

01:50.060 --> 01:54.460
International flying creates communication connections between every language on Earth.

01:54.460 --> 01:57.640
So the IATA code helps when you don't speak Greenlandic or Odia,

01:57.640 --> 02:03.280
but still need to book a flight to Kangerlussac via Bainswar?

02:03.280 --> 02:04.720
I'm so sorry Greenland and India.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.400
Instead of mongoling pronunciation, it's just SFJ via BBI.

02:08.400 --> 02:13.000
Much clearer, not just for you, but also for the ground crew getting the bags through.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.520
Ideally, the IATA code comes from the first three letters of the location,

02:16.520 --> 02:20.280
like with Gibraltar, where Gibraltar airport is given GIB.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.480
Gib, Gibraltar.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.060
So going to Cork, it'll be C-O-R, Coir, Ireland.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.360
Oh, that didn't work.

02:26.360 --> 02:30.620
Seems CÃ³rdoba, Argentina built their airport first and got C-O-R ahead of Cork,

02:30.620 --> 02:32.340
so, uh, Ork for Cork.

02:32.340 --> 02:35.480
Tufnugi's Ork, Germany, that's an adorable town name you've got there,

02:35.480 --> 02:38.020
but you're going to need to pick something else for your code.

02:38.020 --> 02:41.320
Thus, a single code collision kicks off a consistency cascade

02:41.320 --> 02:43.440
as airports compete for clear codes.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.880
So if your local airport has an odd three letters,

02:45.880 --> 02:48.720
there's probably a rival port that picked previously.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.080
This is one of the major things IATA does.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.180
Coordinate everyone's code preferences,

02:53.180 --> 02:56.040
which means dealing with not just individual airports,

02:56.040 --> 02:59.180
but all the aviation agencies in different countries,

02:59.180 --> 03:02.660
some with their own desires for intra-country code consistency,

03:02.660 --> 03:05.560
such as Canada, who clearly claimed all the Y's.

03:05.560 --> 03:10.180
Thus picking a Y1 at random, at least you know roughly where you're going to go.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.060
Oops, no, that didn't work.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.540
YKM brought us to Washington, USA,

03:14.540 --> 03:18.020
and since we're here, we might as well talk about the FAA.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.620
In America, the Federal Aviation Administration,

03:20.620 --> 03:22.120
daughter of the Department of Transportation,

03:22.120 --> 03:27.340
is given the job of assigning all American airports an American airport code.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.260
Yes, the FAA actually has her own set of three letter codes,

03:31.260 --> 03:32.780
but we're not going to talk about it,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.900
because it means in America there's one airport, two codes,

03:35.900 --> 03:38.300
and for simplicity, I'm sticking to this story.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.100
One airport, one code.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.040
Right?

03:41.040 --> 03:41.860
Right.

03:41.860 --> 03:46.740
Now, FAA has letters she'd really rather American airports not.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.940
Please know N, Q, W, K, Z, or Y.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.620
N is reserved for the Navy, for OMG, is it aircraft carriers?

03:53.620 --> 03:56.100
No, they use an unrelated and additional system,

03:56.100 --> 03:57.460
that we're also not going to talk about.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.740
The Navy N is given to Navy bases with airports.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.500
So American airports, like Nashville, that seem like they should start with the letter N,

04:04.500 --> 04:08.940
were encouraged to pick something else, like B, for Banashville.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.700
There is also A for the Army and the Air Force, although not all the A's,

04:12.700 --> 04:17.260
so there's a bunch of A airports, like Albuquerque, Aberdeen, Anchorage, Amarillo, and Augusta.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.740
Next, Q, FAA once avoided because of,

04:19.740 --> 04:22.180
checks, notes, Morse code?

04:22.180 --> 04:23.420
Wow, really?

04:23.420 --> 04:27.380
There's a set of three letter international Morse codes that begin with Q,

04:27.380 --> 04:30.860
for quickie communications, that are still used, I guess?

04:30.860 --> 04:34.220
So, because of 1800's telegraph slang,

04:34.220 --> 04:37.340
American airports shouldn't start with the letter Q.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.820
Next, K and W, FAA advises against,

04:39.820 --> 04:42.420
because FCC, the Federal Communications Commission,

04:42.420 --> 04:44.460
daughter of no one, she's an independent agency,

04:44.460 --> 04:48.180
assigns K and W for US civilian broadcast stations.

04:48.180 --> 04:50.380
So, that thing where on the radio they say,

04:50.380 --> 04:54.860
K-MAD, Action News, or WDUL, Public Airwaves.

04:54.860 --> 04:59.980
Yeah, they all start with a K or W, which is actually location information.

04:59.980 --> 05:03.580
K's are in the west, and W's in the east,

05:03.580 --> 05:05.940
except for the middle, where it's both.

05:05.940 --> 05:08.460
FCC, why did you do it this way?

05:08.460 --> 05:10.500
Well, since you coded those codes first,

05:10.500 --> 05:13.780
FAA discourages airports from starting with those letters.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.940
Even though broadcast codes are four letters, not three,

05:16.940 --> 05:20.300
and they're, you know, radio stations, not airports,

05:20.300 --> 05:22.540
and definitely not weather stations.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.860
Of course they're not weather stations, why would you even say that?

05:24.860 --> 05:26.780
No reason, it won't come up later, don't worry.

05:26.780 --> 05:30.540
Moving on, Z is reserved for air route traffic control centers themselves,

05:30.540 --> 05:31.940
and why no why?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.460
Because Canada, of course.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.740
Yes, I understand, that's not an explanation, we'll get to it later.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.220
That's America's preferences for airport codes,

05:38.220 --> 05:40.060
but other countries exist,

05:40.060 --> 05:44.780
and their aviation agencies don't care at all which letters the United States avoids,

05:44.780 --> 05:47.860
so while Bonashville was building her big-big branding,

05:47.860 --> 05:51.300
Nassau grabbed the N to get NAS for the Bahamian capital.

05:51.300 --> 05:56.020
There's no shortage of airport codes that start outside the US with America's reluctant letters.

05:56.020 --> 05:59.460
And also, because FAA's precedents aren't laws,

05:59.460 --> 06:04.180
you can find American exceptions, like New Kekwa, Yakquig, and Ziv.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.140
Boy, that was fun to say, let's end the video with more of that, shall we?

06:07.140 --> 06:10.540
And that new must particularly burn Newark, New Jersey,

06:10.540 --> 06:13.460
who had to go with Ewerk, U Jersey instead.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.700
Right, finishing this thought,

06:14.700 --> 06:18.140
every country and their agencies has their own wacky preferences for letters

06:18.140 --> 06:20.980
and wants to ignore every other country's preferences,

06:20.980 --> 06:23.740
and IATA's job is to coordinate between them.

06:23.740 --> 06:24.860
The result of which is,

06:24.860 --> 06:29.260
IATA airport codes have no satisfying system at all,

06:29.260 --> 06:32.300
which is so sad for a standard.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.180
And the story of one airport, one code,

06:35.220 --> 06:37.780
also falls apart even within IATA,

06:37.780 --> 06:40.620
because of mega codes for megacities.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.460
Example, London, which has six international airports,

06:43.460 --> 06:45.740
Heathrow, Gatwick City, Luton, Stansted, Southend,

06:45.740 --> 06:47.940
LHR, LGW, LCY, LTN,

06:47.940 --> 06:49.140
oh, they all start with L?

06:49.140 --> 06:51.260
No, STN, SEN.

06:51.260 --> 06:54.620
But there's a mega code for them all, LON,

06:54.620 --> 06:57.500
which you can use while searching for flights landing in London,

06:57.500 --> 06:58.820
but don't care where.

06:58.820 --> 07:01.780
Even though these airports are ages apart.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.780
LON is the International City, Mega Ist, Mega Code,

07:04.780 --> 07:07.700
but there's also Moscow, MOW, and Stockholm STO

07:07.700 --> 07:09.060
with four airports each,

07:09.060 --> 07:12.220
and more with two or three, like NYC and BUE.

07:12.220 --> 07:15.380
And then, code-wise, is the most exceptional airport.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.420
Euro Airport, Basel, Mulhouse, Freiburg.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.820
An airport so nice, they coded it thrice.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.620
MLH, BSL, EAP.

07:21.620 --> 07:22.700
How this happened is,

07:22.700 --> 07:25.780
France and Switzerland both wanted an airport here-ish,

07:25.780 --> 07:27.740
near the German border, and teamed up.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.060
France provided the land, Switzerland the capital,

07:30.060 --> 07:31.580
Germany has nothing to do with this,

07:31.580 --> 07:33.260
and the pair co-built the port,

07:33.260 --> 07:35.620
constructing duplicate and separate everythings.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.820
So it was, effectively, two airports,

07:37.820 --> 07:40.060
run by two countries, with two runways,

07:40.060 --> 07:43.340
and two sets of rules, and thus needed two airport codes,

07:43.340 --> 07:46.180
depending on which side passengers could connect through,

07:46.180 --> 07:48.660
and one mega code if it didn't matter.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.500
But all of this doesn't mega matter now,

07:50.500 --> 07:53.580
because the two airports mostly act as one anyway,

07:53.580 --> 07:55.740
thus one airport, three codes.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.700
And there are plans to run a railway through

07:57.700 --> 07:59.100
for epic intermodalness,

07:59.100 --> 08:02.340
so it could become one airport, four codes, or five codes.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.140
I mean, why not at this point?

08:04.140 --> 08:08.140
So yeah, an airport isn't uniquely identified by one code,

08:08.140 --> 08:10.740
and there's no location information

08:10.740 --> 08:12.860
coded in this location code?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.660
Not even a checksum letter?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.620
What is this, a social security number?

08:16.620 --> 08:18.740
Without a checksum, if you were planning a flight

08:18.740 --> 08:22.940
to CGP Airport in Bangladesh, but typo the incorrect CPG,

08:22.940 --> 08:25.260
you'll end up in Argentina instead.

08:25.260 --> 08:26.100
Again.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.340
But at least the chance of a switcheroo like that

08:28.340 --> 08:29.540
must be pretty small.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.900
After all, a three letter code means 17,000 permutations,

08:33.900 --> 08:36.580
way more than the actual number of airports,

08:36.580 --> 08:41.500
which is only 40,000 airports worldwide?

08:41.500 --> 08:44.060
How can that possibly be true?

08:44.060 --> 08:46.940
Well, it's time to introduce you to IKO,

08:46.940 --> 08:49.700
the International Civil Aviation Organization,

08:49.700 --> 08:51.060
daughter of the United Nations,

08:51.060 --> 08:53.500
who also lives in Montreal with IATA.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.420
And it might seem like they're the same,

08:55.420 --> 08:58.020
but IATA actually only covers what we might call

08:58.020 --> 08:59.980
the standard commercial airports

08:59.980 --> 09:01.980
you'd find searching for flights normally.

09:01.980 --> 09:04.900
While IKO covers what she calls aerodromes,

09:04.900 --> 09:07.340
which is everything from the world's busiest

09:07.340 --> 09:09.940
passenger airport in the always unlikely seeming

09:09.940 --> 09:12.300
Atlanta, Georgia, down to rarely used runways

09:12.300 --> 09:13.700
on ranches in Texas,

09:13.700 --> 09:16.900
of which there are an absolutely absurd number.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.220
So with all those aerodromes to account for,

09:19.220 --> 09:21.900
IKO uses four letters, which gives, wow,

09:21.900 --> 09:23.620
a lot more options, thanks Exponentials.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.860
And she also uses the extra space

09:25.860 --> 09:28.220
to add location information.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.100
Finally, in IKO's system,

09:30.100 --> 09:31.860
the first letter of an airport code

09:31.860 --> 09:33.860
is roughly where on earth it is.

09:33.860 --> 09:36.340
P is for airports in the Pacific,

09:36.340 --> 09:37.700
one letter to cover flying over

09:37.700 --> 09:39.580
the most terrifyingly empty half of the earth.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.100
Try not to think about it as you look down

09:41.100 --> 09:44.140
into the endless abyss before arriving at South America.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.900
S, then M for middle America

09:46.900 --> 09:49.980
and K for continental America.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.500
C sensibly is Canadian America

09:52.500 --> 09:54.820
and flying over the pole we get to U,

09:54.820 --> 09:56.940
for used to be USSR.

09:56.940 --> 09:58.420
Yes, that's actually the name.

09:58.420 --> 10:01.180
Look, what makes standard standards is their stubbornness.

10:01.180 --> 10:03.420
Just because a gigantic country collapsed

10:03.420 --> 10:06.460
is no reason to change what millions of flight computers

10:06.460 --> 10:08.900
know in their code and pilots in their brains.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.180
After IKO's first letter,

10:10.180 --> 10:12.340
there's also a bunch of second sub-letters.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.060
Well, except for America and Canada,

10:14.060 --> 10:15.180
who skipped that, but don't worry.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.460
Moving on, as an example,

10:16.460 --> 10:19.940
if your airport starts with an F, it's in Southern Africa.

10:19.940 --> 10:23.260
And if the next letter is A, that's South Africa.

10:23.260 --> 10:25.500
And the last two letters are for the airport.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.140
So Cape Town gets CT for a fact.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.740
Of course, there are some exceptions like Antarctica,

10:30.740 --> 10:32.060
the continent no one owns,

10:32.060 --> 10:33.740
but all the cool kids want to claim.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.820
Aerodromes here are supposed to use the code

10:35.820 --> 10:37.540
for the country's claim they're in,

10:37.540 --> 10:40.100
such as Williams Field, which is American run,

10:40.100 --> 10:43.980
but uses NZWD because it's in the Kiwi claim.

10:43.980 --> 10:47.500
But also lots of Antarctic aerodromes use pseudocodes.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.980
No, we're not gonna talk about what that means,

10:48.980 --> 10:52.260
which start with a T and end with a number like 27

10:52.260 --> 10:54.900
for Troll Airfield serving Troll Research Station,

10:54.900 --> 10:56.380
which runs on troll time.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.100
Norway, is that you?

10:58.100 --> 10:59.220
I knew it was.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.380
But you really should be using EN for Europe, Norway.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.980
And TR is free.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.940
Enter trolls, it's so perfect.

11:05.940 --> 11:09.220
And yes, the 27 means there are at least 26 other runways

11:09.220 --> 11:10.740
in Antarctica, I was surprised too,

11:10.740 --> 11:12.300
but this along with all of the ranches

11:12.300 --> 11:14.500
is how you get to crazy numbers of aerodromes.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.620
And yes, ICAO has more exceptions to this system

11:17.620 --> 11:18.900
that we're going to skip,

11:18.900 --> 11:22.140
but I can't resist just one more,

11:22.140 --> 11:24.220
which is Region J.

11:24.220 --> 11:26.300
Looking at the map, you won't be able to find it

11:26.300 --> 11:28.900
because J is Mars.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.340
When the rover arrived at Jezero Crater,

11:31.340 --> 11:35.740
ICAO gave the historic landing location the code JZRO.

11:35.740 --> 11:37.220
Okay, but that's it for exceptions.

11:37.220 --> 11:40.380
So to sum up, the story of one airport, one code

11:40.380 --> 11:41.860
was just that, a story.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.820
Tons of airports have at least two.

11:43.820 --> 11:46.180
And when they do, the ICAO code

11:46.180 --> 11:47.820
is what computers and pilots know

11:47.820 --> 11:49.620
to plan where the plane needs to go.

11:49.660 --> 11:52.780
And IATA is what passengers say to get on their way.

11:52.780 --> 11:56.780
But if ICAO exists with a more comprehensive code,

11:56.780 --> 11:58.740
why is IATA at all?

11:58.740 --> 12:02.980
So IATA isn't about you, it's about your bags.

12:02.980 --> 12:06.580
At an airport, you as a human walk to your connecting flight

12:06.580 --> 12:10.140
but your bags below need a lot of logistical assistance.

12:10.140 --> 12:13.860
Before IATA, there was just like a handwritten tag saying,

12:13.860 --> 12:16.820
please get me where my owner is going,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.900
written in potentially every language on earth.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.900
So you can imagine how often that went wrong.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.260
So IATA used codes to make life better for bags

12:26.260 --> 12:28.540
with bag tags, with big clear codes

12:28.540 --> 12:30.980
to get those bags cleanly through connections

12:30.980 --> 12:32.940
across countries and companies.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.280
And the original plan was that train stations

12:35.280 --> 12:38.380
with IATA codes would also let you check in your bag there

12:38.380 --> 12:40.860
and it would be part of the automatic connection too.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.180
But that mostly doesn't happen now

12:43.180 --> 12:44.940
because of logistical difficulties,

12:44.940 --> 12:48.460
which is the same reason that the IATA code is a club

12:48.460 --> 12:50.940
that excludes all the little aerodromes

12:50.940 --> 12:52.860
too annoying to attend to.

12:52.860 --> 12:55.480
So if your bag's final destination after connecting

12:55.480 --> 12:58.020
at Austin is one of the many random ranch airstrips,

12:58.020 --> 13:00.780
the ground crew is not going to swap your bags

13:00.780 --> 13:03.220
onto the tiny crop duster for you.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.500
Ditto if you're connecting through Argentina

13:05.500 --> 13:07.380
to Antarctica, anywhere.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.260
Those tiny airports, no IATA code for you.

13:10.260 --> 13:13.520
And without an IATA code, your bag depends on you

13:13.520 --> 13:15.420
to get it all the way through.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.040
And that's what IATA is actually for.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.320
That big, big branding you see is for your bags.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.840
And because of the tag, it became what customers know,

13:24.840 --> 13:26.720
which brings us back to the start.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.400
And oh, sorry, Canada.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.740
I know I've been avoiding answering the whys,

13:30.740 --> 13:34.240
but it's just so much more complicated than expected.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.220
There's a tale that the whys are an old system

13:36.220 --> 13:39.000
for if Canadian airports had a weather station.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.280
Y for yes, weather station and W without.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.600
And since pilots want to know the weather,

13:44.600 --> 13:46.360
that explains all the whys,

13:46.360 --> 13:49.520
but also the few oddball Canadian Ws.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.580
But investigating the truth of that story

13:52.580 --> 13:55.140
took eight months of my life,

13:55.140 --> 13:56.960
which I will now give to you

13:56.960 --> 14:00.200
as an extremely compressed executive summary.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.340
Working backwards, the American and Canadian IATA codes

14:03.340 --> 14:06.400
created in the 1950s come from the last three letters

14:06.400 --> 14:09.080
of ICAO codes created in the 1940s.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.360
The first letter of ICAO codes come from the ITU,

14:12.360 --> 14:15.140
the International Telecommunications Union's codes

14:15.140 --> 14:18.320
created in the 1910s for radio stations,

14:18.320 --> 14:21.640
which used K for America and CY for Canada.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.320
So K and CY into four letters

14:24.320 --> 14:27.360
and back down to three leaves Y for Canada.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.160
Here is where you would reasonably ask why CY for Canada,

14:31.160 --> 14:35.480
but that goes all the way back to telegraphs and beyond,

14:35.480 --> 14:38.440
so is a story for another time.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.980
But for now, for this video, why Y for Canada?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.880
Because of radio call signs,

14:43.880 --> 14:45.060
because of a lot of other things,

14:45.060 --> 14:47.280
because of US and Canada coordinating

14:47.280 --> 14:49.840
that four flights within North America,

14:49.840 --> 14:53.820
it really would be Y for yes, Canada, mostly.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.440
Well, that was a lot of bureaucratic history,

14:55.440 --> 14:57.720
so let's finish with the final fun IATA codes

14:57.720 --> 14:59.960
promised from before, starting with Sioux City

14:59.960 --> 15:02.800
with the sensible-looking SUX until you say it out loud,

15:02.800 --> 15:04.500
but to her credit totally owns

15:04.500 --> 15:06.160
that branding for airport merch.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.160
Good for you, Sioux.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.600
And there's also Beaches International Airport,

15:09.600 --> 15:10.560
Summer Break Central.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.200
Their top two picks for codes were picked,

15:12.200 --> 15:16.540
so to help the confused collegiates find their connections,

15:16.540 --> 15:21.320
the agencies agreed on ECP to stand for Everyone Can Party,

15:21.320 --> 15:22.880
which is awesome branding,

15:22.880 --> 15:25.980
but you'd never know because Beaches doesn't bother.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.360
Jeez, ECP, you could learn a thing or two from Sioux.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.880
But now everyone can party

15:29.880 --> 15:32.360
on this round-the-world flight of IATA codes

15:32.360 --> 15:34.240
entertaining to say out loud.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.080
Ready?

15:35.080 --> 15:37.080
Boo, eek, cow, wow, poo, gag, bro,

15:37.080 --> 15:40.280
but got hot pie, yum, um, mom, dad, mad, run, fun,

15:40.280 --> 15:42.840
I-O-U-F-A-Q-O-M-G-L-O-L.
