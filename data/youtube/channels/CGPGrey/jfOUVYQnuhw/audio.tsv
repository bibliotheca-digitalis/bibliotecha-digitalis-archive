0	3820	There are thousands of airports connecting cities, cross-countries and continents,
3820	8720	yet with just three letters from AAC and BBI to YYZ and ZZU,
8720	13980	both me and you and our bags root round the world as unambiguously as practically possible.
13980	15100	Airport codes!
15100	19020	If you fly, you know them as part of the planning on your tickets, trackers and tags,
19020	22320	and even as part of the port itself as big big branding.
22320	26580	It's impossible not to wonder bored on a long haul with only in-flight entertainment
26580	31120	about potential patterns peeking through, like all the Canadian Y airports.
31120	33500	Why Canada? And why everyone?
33500	35180	How do all these codes code?
35180	39840	Well, neighbour, to find the answer we need to divert this flight to YUL,
39840	44100	the Canadian city that's capital of codes, Montreal, where is headquartered IATA,
44100	46720	the International Air Transport Association.
46720	52900	It's not a governmental organization, more an independent aviation agency for airlines,
52900	56320	where they work to make airports and airplanes increasingly interoperable,
56320	61740	using humanity's most exciting and powerful yet oft-maligned-as-dull tool, standards.
61740	66900	One of which is the IATA airport code, three letters to identify every airport in the world,
66900	69700	from the most connected to the least.
69700	74340	All are coded so companies can communicate clearly and concisely complicated connections
74340	76700	to carry their customers and their bags.
76700	80040	And actually, the code IATA created isn't only for airports,
80040	84960	rather technically it's a location code for all kinds of transportation interchanges,
84960	88780	like plane stations that connect to train stations such as Amsterdam Shipple,
88780	91660	which is just so intermodally epic.
91660	95220	Okay, let's try not to get distracted by efficient infrastructure, easier said than done.
95220	97860	Here's how the IATA code is supposed to work.
97860	102800	One airport, one code, which is unique because airport names are not.
102800	104300	Booking passage to Portland?
104300	108300	Cool, that could be Oregon or Maine or Victoria, Australia.
108300	110060	Ambiguity is the enemy.
110060	114460	International flying creates communication connections between every language on Earth.
114460	117640	So the IATA code helps when you don't speak Greenlandic or Odia,
117640	123280	but still need to book a flight to Kangerlussac via Bainswar?
123280	124720	I'm so sorry Greenland and India.
124720	128400	Instead of mongoling pronunciation, it's just SFJ via BBI.
128400	133000	Much clearer, not just for you, but also for the ground crew getting the bags through.
133000	136520	Ideally, the IATA code comes from the first three letters of the location,
136520	140280	like with Gibraltar, where Gibraltar airport is given GIB.
140280	141480	Gib, Gibraltar.
141480	145060	So going to Cork, it'll be C-O-R, Coir, Ireland.
145060	146360	Oh, that didn't work.
146360	150620	Seems CÃ³rdoba, Argentina built their airport first and got C-O-R ahead of Cork,
150620	152340	so, uh, Ork for Cork.
152340	155480	Tufnugi's Ork, Germany, that's an adorable town name you've got there,
155480	158020	but you're going to need to pick something else for your code.
158020	161320	Thus, a single code collision kicks off a consistency cascade
161320	163440	as airports compete for clear codes.
163440	165880	So if your local airport has an odd three letters,
165880	168720	there's probably a rival port that picked previously.
168720	171080	This is one of the major things IATA does.
171080	173180	Coordinate everyone's code preferences,
173180	176040	which means dealing with not just individual airports,
176040	179180	but all the aviation agencies in different countries,
179180	182660	some with their own desires for intra-country code consistency,
182660	185560	such as Canada, who clearly claimed all the Y's.
185560	190180	Thus picking a Y1 at random, at least you know roughly where you're going to go.
190180	192060	Oops, no, that didn't work.
192060	194540	YKM brought us to Washington, USA,
194540	198020	and since we're here, we might as well talk about the FAA.
198020	200620	In America, the Federal Aviation Administration,
200620	202120	daughter of the Department of Transportation,
202120	207340	is given the job of assigning all American airports an American airport code.
207340	211260	Yes, the FAA actually has her own set of three letter codes,
211260	212780	but we're not going to talk about it,
212780	215900	because it means in America there's one airport, two codes,
215900	218300	and for simplicity, I'm sticking to this story.
218300	220100	One airport, one code.
220100	221040	Right?
221040	221860	Right.
221860	226740	Now, FAA has letters she'd really rather American airports not.
226740	229940	Please know N, Q, W, K, Z, or Y.
229940	233620	N is reserved for the Navy, for OMG, is it aircraft carriers?
233620	236100	No, they use an unrelated and additional system,
236100	237460	that we're also not going to talk about.
237460	240740	The Navy N is given to Navy bases with airports.
240740	244500	So American airports, like Nashville, that seem like they should start with the letter N,
244500	248940	were encouraged to pick something else, like B, for Banashville.
248940	252700	There is also A for the Army and the Air Force, although not all the A's,
252700	257260	so there's a bunch of A airports, like Albuquerque, Aberdeen, Anchorage, Amarillo, and Augusta.
257260	259740	Next, Q, FAA once avoided because of,
259740	262180	checks, notes, Morse code?
262180	263420	Wow, really?
263420	267380	There's a set of three letter international Morse codes that begin with Q,
267380	270860	for quickie communications, that are still used, I guess?
270860	274220	So, because of 1800's telegraph slang,
274220	277340	American airports shouldn't start with the letter Q.
277340	279820	Next, K and W, FAA advises against,
279820	282420	because FCC, the Federal Communications Commission,
282420	284460	daughter of no one, she's an independent agency,
284460	288180	assigns K and W for US civilian broadcast stations.
288180	290380	So, that thing where on the radio they say,
290380	294860	K-MAD, Action News, or WDUL, Public Airwaves.
294860	299980	Yeah, they all start with a K or W, which is actually location information.
299980	303580	K's are in the west, and W's in the east,
303580	305940	except for the middle, where it's both.
305940	308460	FCC, why did you do it this way?
308460	310500	Well, since you coded those codes first,
310500	313780	FAA discourages airports from starting with those letters.
313780	316940	Even though broadcast codes are four letters, not three,
316940	320300	and they're, you know, radio stations, not airports,
320300	322540	and definitely not weather stations.
322540	324860	Of course they're not weather stations, why would you even say that?
324860	326780	No reason, it won't come up later, don't worry.
326780	330540	Moving on, Z is reserved for air route traffic control centers themselves,
330540	331940	and why no why?
331940	333460	Because Canada, of course.
333460	335740	Yes, I understand, that's not an explanation, we'll get to it later.
335740	338220	That's America's preferences for airport codes,
338220	340060	but other countries exist,
340060	344780	and their aviation agencies don't care at all which letters the United States avoids,
344780	347860	so while Bonashville was building her big-big branding,
347860	351300	Nassau grabbed the N to get NAS for the Bahamian capital.
351300	356020	There's no shortage of airport codes that start outside the US with America's reluctant letters.
356020	359460	And also, because FAA's precedents aren't laws,
359460	364180	you can find American exceptions, like New Kekwa, Yakquig, and Ziv.
364180	367140	Boy, that was fun to say, let's end the video with more of that, shall we?
367140	370540	And that new must particularly burn Newark, New Jersey,
370540	373460	who had to go with Ewerk, U Jersey instead.
373460	374700	Right, finishing this thought,
374700	378140	every country and their agencies has their own wacky preferences for letters
378140	380980	and wants to ignore every other country's preferences,
380980	383740	and IATA's job is to coordinate between them.
383740	384860	The result of which is,
384860	389260	IATA airport codes have no satisfying system at all,
389260	392300	which is so sad for a standard.
392300	395180	And the story of one airport, one code,
395220	397780	also falls apart even within IATA,
397780	400620	because of mega codes for megacities.
400620	403460	Example, London, which has six international airports,
403460	405740	Heathrow, Gatwick City, Luton, Stansted, Southend,
405740	407940	LHR, LGW, LCY, LTN,
407940	409140	oh, they all start with L?
409140	411260	No, STN, SEN.
411260	414620	But there's a mega code for them all, LON,
414620	417500	which you can use while searching for flights landing in London,
417500	418820	but don't care where.
418820	421780	Even though these airports are ages apart.
421780	424780	LON is the International City, Mega Ist, Mega Code,
424780	427700	but there's also Moscow, MOW, and Stockholm STO
427700	429060	with four airports each,
429060	432220	and more with two or three, like NYC and BUE.
432220	435380	And then, code-wise, is the most exceptional airport.
435380	437420	Euro Airport, Basel, Mulhouse, Freiburg.
437420	439820	An airport so nice, they coded it thrice.
439820	441620	MLH, BSL, EAP.
441620	442700	How this happened is,
442700	445780	France and Switzerland both wanted an airport here-ish,
445780	447740	near the German border, and teamed up.
447740	450060	France provided the land, Switzerland the capital,
450060	451580	Germany has nothing to do with this,
451580	453260	and the pair co-built the port,
453260	455620	constructing duplicate and separate everythings.
455620	457820	So it was, effectively, two airports,
457820	460060	run by two countries, with two runways,
460060	463340	and two sets of rules, and thus needed two airport codes,
463340	466180	depending on which side passengers could connect through,
466180	468660	and one mega code if it didn't matter.
468660	470500	But all of this doesn't mega matter now,
470500	473580	because the two airports mostly act as one anyway,
473580	475740	thus one airport, three codes.
475740	477700	And there are plans to run a railway through
477700	479100	for epic intermodalness,
479100	482340	so it could become one airport, four codes, or five codes.
482380	484140	I mean, why not at this point?
484140	488140	So yeah, an airport isn't uniquely identified by one code,
488140	490740	and there's no location information
490740	492860	coded in this location code?
492860	494660	Not even a checksum letter?
494660	496620	What is this, a social security number?
496620	498740	Without a checksum, if you were planning a flight
498740	502940	to CGP Airport in Bangladesh, but typo the incorrect CPG,
502940	505260	you'll end up in Argentina instead.
505260	506100	Again.
506100	508340	But at least the chance of a switcheroo like that
508340	509540	must be pretty small.
509540	513900	After all, a three letter code means 17,000 permutations,
513900	516580	way more than the actual number of airports,
516580	521500	which is only 40,000 airports worldwide?
521500	524060	How can that possibly be true?
524060	526940	Well, it's time to introduce you to IKO,
526940	529700	the International Civil Aviation Organization,
529700	531060	daughter of the United Nations,
531060	533500	who also lives in Montreal with IATA.
533500	535420	And it might seem like they're the same,
535420	538020	but IATA actually only covers what we might call
538020	539980	the standard commercial airports
539980	541980	you'd find searching for flights normally.
541980	544900	While IKO covers what she calls aerodromes,
544900	547340	which is everything from the world's busiest
547340	549940	passenger airport in the always unlikely seeming
549940	552300	Atlanta, Georgia, down to rarely used runways
552300	553700	on ranches in Texas,
553700	556900	of which there are an absolutely absurd number.
556900	559220	So with all those aerodromes to account for,
559220	561900	IKO uses four letters, which gives, wow,
561900	563620	a lot more options, thanks Exponentials.
563620	565860	And she also uses the extra space
565860	568220	to add location information.
568220	570100	Finally, in IKO's system,
570100	571860	the first letter of an airport code
571860	573860	is roughly where on earth it is.
573860	576340	P is for airports in the Pacific,
576340	577700	one letter to cover flying over
577700	579580	the most terrifyingly empty half of the earth.
579580	581100	Try not to think about it as you look down
581100	584140	into the endless abyss before arriving at South America.
584140	586900	S, then M for middle America
586900	589980	and K for continental America.
589980	592500	C sensibly is Canadian America
592500	594820	and flying over the pole we get to U,
594820	596940	for used to be USSR.
596940	598420	Yes, that's actually the name.
598420	601180	Look, what makes standard standards is their stubbornness.
601180	603420	Just because a gigantic country collapsed
603420	606460	is no reason to change what millions of flight computers
606460	608900	know in their code and pilots in their brains.
608900	610180	After IKO's first letter,
610180	612340	there's also a bunch of second sub-letters.
612340	614060	Well, except for America and Canada,
614060	615180	who skipped that, but don't worry.
615180	616460	Moving on, as an example,
616460	619940	if your airport starts with an F, it's in Southern Africa.
619940	623260	And if the next letter is A, that's South Africa.
623260	625500	And the last two letters are for the airport.
625500	628140	So Cape Town gets CT for a fact.
628140	630740	Of course, there are some exceptions like Antarctica,
630740	632060	the continent no one owns,
632060	633740	but all the cool kids want to claim.
633740	635820	Aerodromes here are supposed to use the code
635820	637540	for the country's claim they're in,
637540	640100	such as Williams Field, which is American run,
640100	643980	but uses NZWD because it's in the Kiwi claim.
643980	647500	But also lots of Antarctic aerodromes use pseudocodes.
647500	648980	No, we're not gonna talk about what that means,
648980	652260	which start with a T and end with a number like 27
652260	654900	for Troll Airfield serving Troll Research Station,
654900	656380	which runs on troll time.
656380	658100	Norway, is that you?
658100	659220	I knew it was.
659220	662380	But you really should be using EN for Europe, Norway.
662380	663980	And TR is free.
663980	665940	Enter trolls, it's so perfect.
665940	669220	And yes, the 27 means there are at least 26 other runways
669220	670740	in Antarctica, I was surprised too,
670740	672300	but this along with all of the ranches
672300	674500	is how you get to crazy numbers of aerodromes.
674500	677620	And yes, ICAO has more exceptions to this system
677620	678900	that we're going to skip,
678900	682140	but I can't resist just one more,
682140	684220	which is Region J.
684220	686300	Looking at the map, you won't be able to find it
686300	688900	because J is Mars.
688900	691340	When the rover arrived at Jezero Crater,
691340	695740	ICAO gave the historic landing location the code JZRO.
695740	697220	Okay, but that's it for exceptions.
697220	700380	So to sum up, the story of one airport, one code
700380	701860	was just that, a story.
701860	703820	Tons of airports have at least two.
703820	706180	And when they do, the ICAO code
706180	707820	is what computers and pilots know
707820	709620	to plan where the plane needs to go.
709660	712780	And IATA is what passengers say to get on their way.
712780	716780	But if ICAO exists with a more comprehensive code,
716780	718740	why is IATA at all?
718740	722980	So IATA isn't about you, it's about your bags.
722980	726580	At an airport, you as a human walk to your connecting flight
726580	730140	but your bags below need a lot of logistical assistance.
730140	733860	Before IATA, there was just like a handwritten tag saying,
733860	736820	please get me where my owner is going,
736820	739900	written in potentially every language on earth.
739900	742900	So you can imagine how often that went wrong.
742900	746260	So IATA used codes to make life better for bags
746260	748540	with bag tags, with big clear codes
748540	750980	to get those bags cleanly through connections
750980	752940	across countries and companies.
752940	755280	And the original plan was that train stations
755280	758380	with IATA codes would also let you check in your bag there
758380	760860	and it would be part of the automatic connection too.
760860	763180	But that mostly doesn't happen now
763180	764940	because of logistical difficulties,
764940	768460	which is the same reason that the IATA code is a club
768460	770940	that excludes all the little aerodromes
770940	772860	too annoying to attend to.
772860	775480	So if your bag's final destination after connecting
775480	778020	at Austin is one of the many random ranch airstrips,
778020	780780	the ground crew is not going to swap your bags
780780	783220	onto the tiny crop duster for you.
783220	785500	Ditto if you're connecting through Argentina
785500	787380	to Antarctica, anywhere.
787380	790260	Those tiny airports, no IATA code for you.
790260	793520	And without an IATA code, your bag depends on you
793520	795420	to get it all the way through.
795420	798040	And that's what IATA is actually for.
798040	801320	That big, big branding you see is for your bags.
801320	804840	And because of the tag, it became what customers know,
804840	806720	which brings us back to the start.
806720	808400	And oh, sorry, Canada.
808400	810740	I know I've been avoiding answering the whys,
810740	814240	but it's just so much more complicated than expected.
814240	816220	There's a tale that the whys are an old system
816220	819000	for if Canadian airports had a weather station.
819000	822280	Y for yes, weather station and W without.
822280	824600	And since pilots want to know the weather,
824600	826360	that explains all the whys,
826360	829520	but also the few oddball Canadian Ws.
829520	832580	But investigating the truth of that story
832580	835140	took eight months of my life,
835140	836960	which I will now give to you
836960	840200	as an extremely compressed executive summary.
840200	843340	Working backwards, the American and Canadian IATA codes
843340	846400	created in the 1950s come from the last three letters
846400	849080	of ICAO codes created in the 1940s.
849080	852360	The first letter of ICAO codes come from the ITU,
852360	855140	the International Telecommunications Union's codes
855140	858320	created in the 1910s for radio stations,
858320	861640	which used K for America and CY for Canada.
861640	864320	So K and CY into four letters
864320	867360	and back down to three leaves Y for Canada.
867360	871160	Here is where you would reasonably ask why CY for Canada,
871160	875480	but that goes all the way back to telegraphs and beyond,
875480	878440	so is a story for another time.
878440	881980	But for now, for this video, why Y for Canada?
881980	883880	Because of radio call signs,
883880	885060	because of a lot of other things,
885060	887280	because of US and Canada coordinating
887280	889840	that four flights within North America,
889840	893820	it really would be Y for yes, Canada, mostly.
893820	895440	Well, that was a lot of bureaucratic history,
895440	897720	so let's finish with the final fun IATA codes
897720	899960	promised from before, starting with Sioux City
899960	902800	with the sensible-looking SUX until you say it out loud,
902800	904500	but to her credit totally owns
904500	906160	that branding for airport merch.
906160	907160	Good for you, Sioux.
907200	909600	And there's also Beaches International Airport,
909600	910560	Summer Break Central.
910560	912200	Their top two picks for codes were picked,
912200	916540	so to help the confused collegiates find their connections,
916540	921320	the agencies agreed on ECP to stand for Everyone Can Party,
921320	922880	which is awesome branding,
922880	925980	but you'd never know because Beaches doesn't bother.
925980	928360	Jeez, ECP, you could learn a thing or two from Sioux.
928360	929880	But now everyone can party
929880	932360	on this round-the-world flight of IATA codes
932360	934240	entertaining to say out loud.
934240	935080	Ready?
935080	937080	Boo, eek, cow, wow, poo, gag, bro,
937080	940280	but got hot pie, yum, um, mom, dad, mad, run, fun,
940280	942840	I-O-U-F-A-Q-O-M-G-L-O-L.
