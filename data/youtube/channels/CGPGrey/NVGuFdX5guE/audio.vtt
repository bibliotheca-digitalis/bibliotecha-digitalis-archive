00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Did you set a New Year's resolution for yourself?

00:02.320 --> 00:03.320
How's that going?

00:03.320 --> 00:05.520
I don't know when in the year you're watching,

00:05.520 --> 00:08.600
but if I had to bet on the status of your resolution,

00:08.600 --> 00:12.520
it's probably not flourishing, but failed or forgone.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.520
This is usually what the effort curve on resolutions looks like.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.280
If New Year's is new to you, you are forgiven for not knowing.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.160
But come on, this isn't your first resolution rodeo.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.160
You've been here before, saddled up to a resolution,

00:25.160 --> 00:26.920
gotten thrown off in short order,

00:26.960 --> 00:30.080
only to come back next year to pick a buck of a different color,

00:30.080 --> 00:31.480
or worse, the same.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.200
Riding, rolling, retreating, returning,

00:34.200 --> 00:38.720
year after year after year of your unchanging life

00:38.720 --> 00:41.440
until a disappointed reaper calls time.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.400
New Year's resolutions suck.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.800
Human behavior change is really hard,

00:45.800 --> 00:49.080
and the resolution rodeo, this is not the way.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.720
Instead, to accomplish what you want out of resolutions,

00:51.720 --> 00:54.240
positive life change, but in a better way,

00:54.240 --> 00:56.840
allow me to suggest a gentler idea.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.680
Give yourself a theme.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.800
Instead of setting yourself up to fail with,

01:00.800 --> 01:03.400
I'm going to lose X pounds by next year,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.680
or I'm going to read one book a week at least,

01:06.680 --> 01:09.360
a theme would be something like year of reading

01:09.360 --> 01:10.880
or year of health.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.360
Now, if that sounds a bit broad, that's the point.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.040
For some things, precision matters.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.520
For others, it doesn't.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.360
And when trying to build yourself

01:18.360 --> 01:20.120
into a better version of yourself,

01:20.120 --> 01:22.040
exact data points don't matter.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.000
All that matters is the trendline.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.680
If the trend is going in the right direction, so are you.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.160
Just moving a trend from negative to positive

01:29.160 --> 01:32.080
is hard enough without defining falling short

01:32.080 --> 01:33.680
of a goal as failure.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.000
Heck, even just decelerating the negative is a positive.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.160
Is there something you want more of in your life?

01:39.160 --> 01:40.560
Something you want less of?

01:40.560 --> 01:42.360
Well, life is a branching path,

01:42.360 --> 01:44.040
and it's the trend of your decisions.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.920
Some big, but mostly small,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.920
that will get you to more or less.

01:47.920 --> 01:48.840
Stuck in a queue?

01:48.840 --> 01:49.680
What to do?

01:49.680 --> 01:52.480
Well, if it's the year of reading, why not open the book

01:52.480 --> 01:54.760
instead of opening the anything else?

01:54.760 --> 01:55.600
That's it.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.440
You were at a branch and went one way instead of the other.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.840
Having a theme is like creating a friendly bot

02:00.840 --> 02:02.280
to follow you on the path,

02:02.280 --> 02:05.480
to help notice branches and consider choices with you,

02:05.480 --> 02:07.480
reminding you to be a little different

02:07.480 --> 02:09.240
in little moments sometimes.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.080
An example.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.840
One year, my theme was novelty.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.720
I felt like things had become too samey.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.760
Rather than resolve,

02:14.760 --> 02:18.440
I'm going to do N new things per T time,

02:18.440 --> 02:20.320
it was just year of novelty.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.400
So when it made sense,

02:21.400 --> 02:23.760
why not try the new instead of the known?

02:23.760 --> 02:25.080
It's the year of novelty.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.360
Now, I didn't go crazy,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.720
but that time was more novel than normal.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.800
Mission accomplished.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.400
A good theme can't fail.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.800
Because just having a theme bot along

02:33.800 --> 02:36.800
will point out paths you wouldn't have noticed otherwise,

02:36.800 --> 02:38.400
which will start to change you.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.880
More on that in a moment.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.680
In picking a theme,

02:40.680 --> 02:43.240
go with something that has a nice, broad name

02:43.240 --> 02:46.520
for the general direction you want to navigate your life.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.720
And it is navigation.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.240
The diverging paths of life

02:49.240 --> 02:51.320
are hidden under the fog of the future.

02:51.320 --> 02:54.280
You can't plan the route and then fail to follow it

02:54.280 --> 02:55.720
because there is no map.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.000
And unseen obstacles await.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.120
At any moment, you are where you are

03:00.120 --> 03:02.160
and can only navigate from there.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.920
Perhaps you started a year of health

03:03.920 --> 03:05.560
focused on weight loss or gains

03:05.560 --> 03:08.480
before realizing there's a more foundational problem.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.440
You haven't failed.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.920
It's still year of health.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.960
The broadness of a theme allows its meaning to change.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.880
You started out wanting to read more books,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.320
but maybe as you went on,

03:17.320 --> 03:19.720
you realized academic papers are where it's at

03:19.720 --> 03:22.360
or that reading reading just doesn't work for you

03:22.400 --> 03:24.560
and listening reading is the way to go.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.600
You're still on theme.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.040
The theme can change because so will you.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.960
Having a theme, you will notice paths you didn't before.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.200
This gets you to think about your thinking

03:33.200 --> 03:35.840
and thinking about your thinking changes your thinking,

03:35.840 --> 03:37.760
which changes who you are.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.880
So a broad theme allows its meaning to adapt with you

03:40.880 --> 03:43.640
without the guilt of having failed to meet the goals

03:43.640 --> 03:46.320
of a past you who doesn't exist anymore.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.280
I did year of order for a while,

03:48.280 --> 03:50.080
but what order meant to me at the end

03:50.080 --> 03:51.720
was different from the start

03:51.760 --> 03:52.920
and that's fine.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.160
So themes should be broad, directional,

03:55.160 --> 03:57.080
but most importantly, resonant.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.600
Resonance is a physics phenomenon

03:58.600 --> 04:00.960
where if you have a glass and tuning forks

04:00.960 --> 04:02.080
of different sizes,

04:02.080 --> 04:04.360
bringing the right sized humming tuning fork

04:04.360 --> 04:07.360
near the glass makes it hum the same note.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.480
Words are tuning forks for the brain.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.000
When picking a theme, you're looking for a word or words

04:12.000 --> 04:14.920
that cause your brain to vibrate in resonance.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.760
I've been talking about themes for years

04:16.760 --> 04:18.280
and getting people to try them.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.800
Here are some of the words I've seen people use.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.600
The details of what they mean to anyone don't matter.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.080
What matters is if there's something that strikes you,

04:26.080 --> 04:27.600
calls out to your brain.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.920
That is resonance.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.680
So pick a broad directional phrase

04:30.680 --> 04:32.720
that resonates with you and run with it.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.040
Your brain and the theme will make it work.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.160
Now, if this seems very hippy dippy, lovey dovey,

04:37.160 --> 04:39.320
huggy wuggy, fuzzy wuzzy, that's fine.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.400
Not all tools need sharp edges.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
I think of it this way.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.240
You should be trying to build a life you want to live

04:45.240 --> 04:48.800
and themes are a fuzzy, high level, longer term way

04:48.840 --> 04:52.040
to navigate your brain at a broad area of change.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.480
Smaller and specificer are the systems in life

04:54.480 --> 04:55.800
you might want to set up.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.200
Below that are the targets those systems might

04:58.200 --> 04:59.360
or might not generate.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.480
And at the most concrete and sharp

05:01.480 --> 05:05.080
is the action or decision current you is currently taking.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.880
This level of detail is perhaps a story for another time,

05:07.880 --> 05:10.640
but creating a theme is the bigger and broader

05:10.640 --> 05:12.480
to guide the smaller and shorter.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.880
Lastly, you may have noticed

05:13.880 --> 05:16.080
the examples were all year of thing,

05:16.080 --> 05:17.680
but that's mainly because I've been trying

05:17.680 --> 05:20.240
to gently introduce you to the idea.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.560
Resolutions are a year.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.880
Why not swap them for a theme instead?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.800
But if you're still here, a year is way long.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.480
Again, fog of the future.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.480
A season is a nice human length of time.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.760
In a winter of learning, you can learn a lot,

05:33.760 --> 05:35.480
but you do need to get started

05:35.480 --> 05:38.800
because it's also not so long as to feel forever.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.520
Nature's clock ticks on,

05:40.520 --> 05:43.320
reminding you that flowers bloom but briefly,

05:43.320 --> 05:46.840
the summer sun will wane, leaves eventually drop,

05:46.840 --> 05:50.800
snow falls and snow melts, and flowers bloom but briefly.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.040
You can be unchanging through all that,

05:53.040 --> 05:56.400
but whenever you are, if you've never had a theme,

05:56.400 --> 05:59.840
give yourself time to find one that resonates with you

05:59.840 --> 06:02.040
and try it out in the coming season.
