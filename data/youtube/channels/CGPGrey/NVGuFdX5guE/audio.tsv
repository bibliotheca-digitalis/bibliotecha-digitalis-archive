0	2320	Did you set a New Year's resolution for yourself?
2320	3320	How's that going?
3320	5520	I don't know when in the year you're watching,
5520	8600	but if I had to bet on the status of your resolution,
8600	12520	it's probably not flourishing, but failed or forgone.
12520	16520	This is usually what the effort curve on resolutions looks like.
16520	19280	If New Year's is new to you, you are forgiven for not knowing.
19280	22160	But come on, this isn't your first resolution rodeo.
22160	25160	You've been here before, saddled up to a resolution,
25160	26920	gotten thrown off in short order,
26960	30080	only to come back next year to pick a buck of a different color,
30080	31480	or worse, the same.
31480	34200	Riding, rolling, retreating, returning,
34200	38720	year after year after year of your unchanging life
38720	41440	until a disappointed reaper calls time.
41440	43400	New Year's resolutions suck.
43400	45800	Human behavior change is really hard,
45800	49080	and the resolution rodeo, this is not the way.
49080	51720	Instead, to accomplish what you want out of resolutions,
51720	54240	positive life change, but in a better way,
54240	56840	allow me to suggest a gentler idea.
56840	58680	Give yourself a theme.
58680	60800	Instead of setting yourself up to fail with,
60800	63400	I'm going to lose X pounds by next year,
63400	66680	or I'm going to read one book a week at least,
66680	69360	a theme would be something like year of reading
69360	70880	or year of health.
70880	73360	Now, if that sounds a bit broad, that's the point.
73360	75040	For some things, precision matters.
75040	76520	For others, it doesn't.
76520	78360	And when trying to build yourself
78360	80120	into a better version of yourself,
80120	82040	exact data points don't matter.
82040	84000	All that matters is the trendline.
84000	86680	If the trend is going in the right direction, so are you.
86680	89160	Just moving a trend from negative to positive
89160	92080	is hard enough without defining falling short
92080	93680	of a goal as failure.
93680	97000	Heck, even just decelerating the negative is a positive.
97000	99160	Is there something you want more of in your life?
99160	100560	Something you want less of?
100560	102360	Well, life is a branching path,
102360	104040	and it's the trend of your decisions.
104040	105920	Some big, but mostly small,
105920	107920	that will get you to more or less.
107920	108840	Stuck in a queue?
108840	109680	What to do?
109680	112480	Well, if it's the year of reading, why not open the book
112480	114760	instead of opening the anything else?
114760	115600	That's it.
115600	118440	You were at a branch and went one way instead of the other.
118440	120840	Having a theme is like creating a friendly bot
120840	122280	to follow you on the path,
122280	125480	to help notice branches and consider choices with you,
125480	127480	reminding you to be a little different
127480	129240	in little moments sometimes.
129240	130080	An example.
130080	131840	One year, my theme was novelty.
131840	133720	I felt like things had become too samey.
133720	134760	Rather than resolve,
134760	138440	I'm going to do N new things per T time,
138440	140320	it was just year of novelty.
140320	141400	So when it made sense,
141400	143760	why not try the new instead of the known?
143760	145080	It's the year of novelty.
145080	146360	Now, I didn't go crazy,
146360	148720	but that time was more novel than normal.
148720	149800	Mission accomplished.
149800	151400	A good theme can't fail.
151400	153800	Because just having a theme bot along
153800	156800	will point out paths you wouldn't have noticed otherwise,
156800	158400	which will start to change you.
158400	159880	More on that in a moment.
159880	160680	In picking a theme,
160680	163240	go with something that has a nice, broad name
163240	166520	for the general direction you want to navigate your life.
166520	167720	And it is navigation.
167720	169240	The diverging paths of life
169240	171320	are hidden under the fog of the future.
171320	174280	You can't plan the route and then fail to follow it
174280	175720	because there is no map.
175720	178000	And unseen obstacles await.
178000	180120	At any moment, you are where you are
180120	182160	and can only navigate from there.
182160	183920	Perhaps you started a year of health
183920	185560	focused on weight loss or gains
185560	188480	before realizing there's a more foundational problem.
188480	189440	You haven't failed.
189440	190920	It's still year of health.
190920	193960	The broadness of a theme allows its meaning to change.
193960	195880	You started out wanting to read more books,
195880	197320	but maybe as you went on,
197320	199720	you realized academic papers are where it's at
199720	202360	or that reading reading just doesn't work for you
202400	204560	and listening reading is the way to go.
204560	205600	You're still on theme.
205600	208040	The theme can change because so will you.
208040	210960	Having a theme, you will notice paths you didn't before.
210960	213200	This gets you to think about your thinking
213200	215840	and thinking about your thinking changes your thinking,
215840	217760	which changes who you are.
217760	220880	So a broad theme allows its meaning to adapt with you
220880	223640	without the guilt of having failed to meet the goals
223640	226320	of a past you who doesn't exist anymore.
226320	228280	I did year of order for a while,
228280	230080	but what order meant to me at the end
230080	231720	was different from the start
231760	232920	and that's fine.
232920	235160	So themes should be broad, directional,
235160	237080	but most importantly, resonant.
237080	238600	Resonance is a physics phenomenon
238600	240960	where if you have a glass and tuning forks
240960	242080	of different sizes,
242080	244360	bringing the right sized humming tuning fork
244360	247360	near the glass makes it hum the same note.
247360	249480	Words are tuning forks for the brain.
249480	252000	When picking a theme, you're looking for a word or words
252000	254920	that cause your brain to vibrate in resonance.
254920	256760	I've been talking about themes for years
256760	258280	and getting people to try them.
258280	260800	Here are some of the words I've seen people use.
260880	263600	The details of what they mean to anyone don't matter.
263600	266080	What matters is if there's something that strikes you,
266080	267600	calls out to your brain.
267600	268920	That is resonance.
268920	270680	So pick a broad directional phrase
270680	272720	that resonates with you and run with it.
272720	275040	Your brain and the theme will make it work.
275040	277160	Now, if this seems very hippy dippy, lovey dovey,
277160	279320	huggy wuggy, fuzzy wuzzy, that's fine.
279320	281400	Not all tools need sharp edges.
281400	282400	I think of it this way.
282400	285240	You should be trying to build a life you want to live
285240	288800	and themes are a fuzzy, high level, longer term way
288840	292040	to navigate your brain at a broad area of change.
292040	294480	Smaller and specificer are the systems in life
294480	295800	you might want to set up.
295800	298200	Below that are the targets those systems might
298200	299360	or might not generate.
299360	301480	And at the most concrete and sharp
301480	305080	is the action or decision current you is currently taking.
305080	307880	This level of detail is perhaps a story for another time,
307880	310640	but creating a theme is the bigger and broader
310640	312480	to guide the smaller and shorter.
312480	313880	Lastly, you may have noticed
313880	316080	the examples were all year of thing,
316080	317680	but that's mainly because I've been trying
317680	320240	to gently introduce you to the idea.
320240	321560	Resolutions are a year.
321560	323880	Why not swap them for a theme instead?
323880	326800	But if you're still here, a year is way long.
326800	328480	Again, fog of the future.
328480	331480	A season is a nice human length of time.
331480	333760	In a winter of learning, you can learn a lot,
333760	335480	but you do need to get started
335480	338800	because it's also not so long as to feel forever.
338800	340520	Nature's clock ticks on,
340520	343320	reminding you that flowers bloom but briefly,
343320	346840	the summer sun will wane, leaves eventually drop,
346840	350800	snow falls and snow melts, and flowers bloom but briefly.
350800	353040	You can be unchanging through all that,
353040	356400	but whenever you are, if you've never had a theme,
356400	359840	give yourself time to find one that resonates with you
359840	362040	and try it out in the coming season.
