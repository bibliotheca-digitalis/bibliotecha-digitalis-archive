1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Did you set a New Year's resolution for yourself?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,320
How's that going?

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,520
I don't know when in the year you're watching,

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,600
but if I had to bet on the status of your resolution,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,520
it's probably not flourishing, but failed or forgone.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,520
This is usually what the effort curve on resolutions looks like.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,280
If New Year's is new to you, you are forgiven for not knowing.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,160
But come on, this isn't your first resolution rodeo.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
You've been here before, saddled up to a resolution,

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,920
gotten thrown off in short order,

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
only to come back next year to pick a buck of a different color,

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,480
or worse, the same.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,200
Riding, rolling, retreating, returning,

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,720
year after year after year of your unchanging life

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,440
until a disappointed reaper calls time.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,400
New Year's resolutions suck.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,800
Human behavior change is really hard,

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,080
and the resolution rodeo, this is not the way.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,720
Instead, to accomplish what you want out of resolutions,

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,240
positive life change, but in a better way,

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,840
allow me to suggest a gentler idea.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,680
Give yourself a theme.

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,800
Instead of setting yourself up to fail with,

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm going to lose X pounds by next year,

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,680
or I'm going to read one book a week at least,

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,360
a theme would be something like year of reading

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,880
or year of health.

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,360
Now, if that sounds a bit broad, that's the point.

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
For some things, precision matters.

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,520
For others, it doesn't.

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,360
And when trying to build yourself

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,120
into a better version of yourself,

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,040
exact data points don't matter.

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
All that matters is the trendline.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,680
If the trend is going in the right direction, so are you.

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,160
Just moving a trend from negative to positive

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,080
is hard enough without defining falling short

38
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,680
of a goal as failure.

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,000
Heck, even just decelerating the negative is a positive.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,160
Is there something you want more of in your life?

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,560
Something you want less of?

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,360
Well, life is a branching path,

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,040
and it's the trend of your decisions.

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,920
Some big, but mostly small,

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
that will get you to more or less.

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
Stuck in a queue?

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,680
What to do?

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Well, if it's the year of reading, why not open the book

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,760
instead of opening the anything else?

50
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
That's it.

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,440
You were at a branch and went one way instead of the other.

52
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,840
Having a theme is like creating a friendly bot

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
to follow you on the path,

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,480
to help notice branches and consider choices with you,

55
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
reminding you to be a little different

56
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,240
in little moments sometimes.

57
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
An example.

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
One year, my theme was novelty.

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,720
I felt like things had become too samey.

60
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,760
Rather than resolve,

61
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm going to do N new things per T time,

62
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,320
it was just year of novelty.

63
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,400
So when it made sense,

64
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,760
why not try the new instead of the known?

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,080
It's the year of novelty.

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Now, I didn't go crazy,

67
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,720
but that time was more novel than normal.

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Mission accomplished.

69
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
A good theme can't fail.

70
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,800
Because just having a theme bot along

71
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
will point out paths you wouldn't have noticed otherwise,

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
which will start to change you.

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,880
More on that in a moment.

74
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,680
In picking a theme,

75
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,240
go with something that has a nice, broad name

76
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,520
for the general direction you want to navigate your life.

77
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
And it is navigation.

78
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,240
The diverging paths of life

79
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,320
are hidden under the fog of the future.

80
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,280
You can't plan the route and then fail to follow it

81
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,720
because there is no map.

82
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,000
And unseen obstacles await.

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,120
At any moment, you are where you are

84
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,160
and can only navigate from there.

85
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,920
Perhaps you started a year of health

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,560
focused on weight loss or gains

87
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,480
before realizing there's a more foundational problem.

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
You haven't failed.

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,920
It's still year of health.

90
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,960
The broadness of a theme allows its meaning to change.

91
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,880
You started out wanting to read more books,

92
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,320
but maybe as you went on,

93
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,720
you realized academic papers are where it's at

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,360
or that reading reading just doesn't work for you

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
and listening reading is the way to go.

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,600
You're still on theme.

97
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,040
The theme can change because so will you.

98
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Having a theme, you will notice paths you didn't before.

99
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,200
This gets you to think about your thinking

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
and thinking about your thinking changes your thinking,

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
which changes who you are.

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,880
So a broad theme allows its meaning to adapt with you

103
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,640
without the guilt of having failed to meet the goals

104
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,320
of a past you who doesn't exist anymore.

105
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,280
I did year of order for a while,

106
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,080
but what order meant to me at the end

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,720
was different from the start

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,920
and that's fine.

109
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,160
So themes should be broad, directional,

110
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,080
but most importantly, resonant.

111
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,600
Resonance is a physics phenomenon

112
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,960
where if you have a glass and tuning forks

113
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
of different sizes,

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,360
bringing the right sized humming tuning fork

115
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,360
near the glass makes it hum the same note.

116
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Words are tuning forks for the brain.

117
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
When picking a theme, you're looking for a word or words

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,920
that cause your brain to vibrate in resonance.

119
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,760
I've been talking about themes for years

120
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,280
and getting people to try them.

121
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,800
Here are some of the words I've seen people use.

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
The details of what they mean to anyone don't matter.

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
What matters is if there's something that strikes you,

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
calls out to your brain.

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
That is resonance.

126
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,680
So pick a broad directional phrase

127
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,720
that resonates with you and run with it.

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Your brain and the theme will make it work.

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,160
Now, if this seems very hippy dippy, lovey dovey,

130
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,320
huggy wuggy, fuzzy wuzzy, that's fine.

131
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,400
Not all tools need sharp edges.

132
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
I think of it this way.

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,240
You should be trying to build a life you want to live

134
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,800
and themes are a fuzzy, high level, longer term way

135
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,040
to navigate your brain at a broad area of change.

136
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,480
Smaller and specificer are the systems in life

137
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,800
you might want to set up.

138
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Below that are the targets those systems might

139
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,360
or might not generate.

140
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
And at the most concrete and sharp

141
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,080
is the action or decision current you is currently taking.

142
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,880
This level of detail is perhaps a story for another time,

143
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,640
but creating a theme is the bigger and broader

144
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,480
to guide the smaller and shorter.

145
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,880
Lastly, you may have noticed

146
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,080
the examples were all year of thing,

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
but that's mainly because I've been trying

148
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
to gently introduce you to the idea.

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,560
Resolutions are a year.

150
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,880
Why not swap them for a theme instead?

151
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,800
But if you're still here, a year is way long.

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Again, fog of the future.

153
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
A season is a nice human length of time.

154
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,760
In a winter of learning, you can learn a lot,

155
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,480
but you do need to get started

156
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,800
because it's also not so long as to feel forever.

157
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,520
Nature's clock ticks on,

158
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,320
reminding you that flowers bloom but briefly,

159
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,840
the summer sun will wane, leaves eventually drop,

160
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,800
snow falls and snow melts, and flowers bloom but briefly.

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,040
You can be unchanging through all that,

162
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,400
but whenever you are, if you've never had a theme,

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,840
give yourself time to find one that resonates with you

164
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,040
and try it out in the coming season.
