0	4000	Wow, it finally snowed again in London.
4000	8000	Snow day? Not to be squandered inside.
8000	12000	I'm supposed to be working today, but does daily vlogging count?
12000	16000	I'm not a daily vlogger, but I think if I make a vlog that could totally count.
16000	24000	Come, join me as I do nothing more than look at beautiful things on this snow day with Grey.
30000	56000	Music
56000	59000	Man it is just beautiful out here.
59000	68000	It looks like the snow might stick for more than just this morning, so I'm gonna head over to the underground to get to the center of the city while it lasts.
68000	71000	Still be snow, still be snow, still be snow.
71000	73000	Yes, yes, yes!
73000	81000	In all my years in London, snow is so rare that I've never been able to get to the center while it still looks like this. This is amazing!
81000	84000	No fun zone around the lions, but whatever.
84000	88000	Okay, I'm going as far as I can before I freeze.
88000	98000	The problem with London not having real winters is you don't have a real winter coat and real winter gloves, so it's easy to get quite cold quite fast.
106000	111000	That was a cold walk across the Golden Jubilee. Coffee warm up required.
112000	115000	Uh, coffee?
122000	125000	Okay, powered up. Resuming snow exploration.
132000	134000	Ooh, the beach is open.
141000	151000	Music
151000	157000	Goodbye birds! Time to hustle, hustle over to the high viewing platform at the Tate Modern.
171000	176000	You've got to be kidding me. London cannot weather weather. This is not adverse weather.
178000	180000	The pigeon agrees with me.
180000	191000	Well, it looks like to get a view from above, I need to keep trekking to Baradur, which I'm gonna be really disappointed if Baradur is closed for adverse weather.
191000	194000	It's not adverse weather. It's glorious weather!
194000	211000	Music
211000	213000	Thank you.
213000	227000	Music
227000	229000	It's open to the sky!
229000	234000	Music
234000	236000	I am the eye.
259000	284000	Music
284000	292000	Well, in the time it took me to get back again, the sun has come out and the snow has started to melt.
292000	299000	But, I will not forget the gift of this day, and I'm glad I could share it with you.
314000	326000	Music
