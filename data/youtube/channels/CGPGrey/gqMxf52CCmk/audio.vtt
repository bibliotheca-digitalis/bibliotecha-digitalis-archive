00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Wow, it finally snowed again in London.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Snow day? Not to be squandered inside.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm supposed to be working today, but does daily vlogging count?

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm not a daily vlogger, but I think if I make a vlog that could totally count.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
Come, join me as I do nothing more than look at beautiful things on this snow day with Grey.

00:30.000 --> 00:56.000
Music

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Man it is just beautiful out here.

00:59.000 --> 01:08.000
It looks like the snow might stick for more than just this morning, so I'm gonna head over to the underground to get to the center of the city while it lasts.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Still be snow, still be snow, still be snow.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes, yes, yes!

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
In all my years in London, snow is so rare that I've never been able to get to the center while it still looks like this. This is amazing!

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
No fun zone around the lions, but whatever.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay, I'm going as far as I can before I freeze.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
The problem with London not having real winters is you don't have a real winter coat and real winter gloves, so it's easy to get quite cold quite fast.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
That was a cold walk across the Golden Jubilee. Coffee warm up required.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Uh, coffee?

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Okay, powered up. Resuming snow exploration.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Ooh, the beach is open.

02:21.000 --> 02:31.000
Music

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Goodbye birds! Time to hustle, hustle over to the high viewing platform at the Tate Modern.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
You've got to be kidding me. London cannot weather weather. This is not adverse weather.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
The pigeon agrees with me.

03:00.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, it looks like to get a view from above, I need to keep trekking to Baradur, which I'm gonna be really disappointed if Baradur is closed for adverse weather.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
It's not adverse weather. It's glorious weather!

03:14.000 --> 03:31.000
Music

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Thank you.

03:33.000 --> 03:47.000
Music

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's open to the sky!

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Music

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I am the eye.

04:19.000 --> 04:44.000
Music

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
Well, in the time it took me to get back again, the sun has come out and the snow has started to melt.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
But, I will not forget the gift of this day, and I'm glad I could share it with you.

05:14.000 --> 05:26.000
