1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Number 10.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,440
The Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from space.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,800
To see something on Earth from space it would have to be pretty big, which the Great Wall

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,040
of China, all 5,000 miles of it, certainly is, but it's only 30 feet across at its

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
widest.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,480
Here's a photo taken from the International Space Station 200 miles above Earth.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,600
Can you spot the Great Wall amid the mountain tops?

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Here, right?

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,180
No, that's a river.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,920
The wall is actually here.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,140
Even if you guess the right lines by pure luck, this photo was taken with a zoom lens,

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,500
so from the window of the International Space Station it would look more like this.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,440
Which pretty clearly makes the Great Wall count as not visible.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,140
As for the man-made part of this misconception, are glorious man-made cities blasting light

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,960
into the void certainly are visible.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Number 9.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,440
Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Socially obnoxious?

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Yes.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Gives you arthritis later in life as karmic punishment?

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
No.

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Number 8.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,080
People only use 10% of their brain.

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,560
If you haven't seen a medical drama in the past, oh, 30 years, you might not be aware

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,800
that doctors now have machines that can see inside people's brains and, contrary to popular

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,320
belief, 90% of the neurons don't sit around all day doing nothing.

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,000
While scientists don't yet know exactly what each part does, they do know that all the

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
bits matter.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,920
So if you think that someone could scoop out 90% of your brain and you'd still be just

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,120
fine then perhaps you really only do use 10% of it.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Number 7.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,880
Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow.

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,960
This one is technically correct but misleading.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,980
Some languages, such as German, like to make compound words by running several smaller

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,660
ones together, which is why German words are sometimes absurdly long.

36
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,300
Inuit languages use compound words as well, so rather than say yellow snow, as you would

37
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,940
in English, an Inuit speaker combines the two words into one.

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,900
But it's not really a new word, just a quirk of grammar.

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,980
So technically Eskimos do have hundreds of ways to describe snow, but then so does every

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
language.

41
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
Number 6.

42
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,180
You need 8 glasses of water a day.

43
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,180
While doubtless some people would benefit from drinking more water and drinking less

44
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,020
crap, there is no scientific evidence that 8 glasses of water a day is the required amount

45
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,280
and some evidence that it might be too much.

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
And while we're talking about water...

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Number 5.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Tap water is bad, but bottled water is good.

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,260
If you live in a paradise free from government regulations, like say Somalia, then you might

50
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,920
have good reason to prefer bottled water over tap.

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,380
But modern, functioning countries have something called health regulations which cover both

52
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,160
kinds of water.

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,920
Also water is extremely dense, making transporting it from those pristine mountain tops and glaciers

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,840
enormously expensive, which is why bottled water companies don't bother.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,240
Bottled water is often just local tap water with a fancy label and an enormous markup.

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Number 4.

57
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,460
You need 7 years to pass through your digestive system.

58
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,840
This is pretty easy to disprove yourself, but it's understandable why most people don't

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
try the experiment.

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Number 3.

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
Blood in your veins is blue.

62
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,640
The idea here is that blood in veins is blue and it only turns red when exposed to the

63
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,360
oxygen in the air.

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,620
Thinking this isn't unreasonable, after all your veins look blue and medical diagrams

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,360
show arteries as red and veins as blue, but it's the same mistake as thinking that Mountain

66
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,920
Dew is green because it's in a green bottle.

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,140
Pour it out and you discover that Mountain Dew is really piss yellow, which is probably

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,280
why it's in a green bottle to begin with.

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,560
The next time you get blood withdrawn from a vein, take a look.

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
What color is it?

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Red.

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,860
How much oxygen is inside a good syringe?

73
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,860
None.

74
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,940
Unless you're a horseshoe crab or a plava lagoona, your blood isn't blue.

75
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,120
Number 2.

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Fan death.

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,260
This misconception is a specialty of South Korea.

78
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,940
Here, the belief is that if you spend too much time with a rotating fan in a confined

79
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,100
space, it will use up all your oxygen and you'll asphyxiate to death.

80
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,940
Exactly how the fan, made of a lifeless anaerobic plastic, competes for your oxygen is unclear,

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,180
but hilariously South Korean fan manufacturers, who surely must know better, include timers

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,740
on fans to prevent them from running too long.

83
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Number 1.

84
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,380
People swallow 8 spiders a year while sleeping.

85
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,860
Supposedly while you're in bed, helplessly unconscious with your gob wide open, each

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,500
year 8 spiders find their way into your mouth and you reflexively swallow them.

87
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,260
This is plainly ridiculous.

88
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,660
Humans love warm, moist places, so 8 is far too low an estimate.
