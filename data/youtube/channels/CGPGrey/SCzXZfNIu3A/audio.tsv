0	5040	Number 10.
5040	8440	The Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from space.
8440	11800	To see something on Earth from space it would have to be pretty big, which the Great Wall
11800	16040	of China, all 5,000 miles of it, certainly is, but it's only 30 feet across at its
16040	17040	widest.
17040	20480	Here's a photo taken from the International Space Station 200 miles above Earth.
20480	22600	Can you spot the Great Wall amid the mountain tops?
22600	23600	Here, right?
23600	25180	No, that's a river.
25180	26920	The wall is actually here.
26920	30140	Even if you guess the right lines by pure luck, this photo was taken with a zoom lens,
30140	33500	so from the window of the International Space Station it would look more like this.
33500	36440	Which pretty clearly makes the Great Wall count as not visible.
36440	40140	As for the man-made part of this misconception, are glorious man-made cities blasting light
40140	42960	into the void certainly are visible.
42960	43960	Number 9.
43960	45440	Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis.
45440	46440	Socially obnoxious?
46440	47440	Yes.
47440	49440	Gives you arthritis later in life as karmic punishment?
49440	50440	No.
50440	51440	Number 8.
51440	53080	People only use 10% of their brain.
53080	56560	If you haven't seen a medical drama in the past, oh, 30 years, you might not be aware
56600	60800	that doctors now have machines that can see inside people's brains and, contrary to popular
60800	64320	belief, 90% of the neurons don't sit around all day doing nothing.
64320	68000	While scientists don't yet know exactly what each part does, they do know that all the
68000	69000	bits matter.
69000	71920	So if you think that someone could scoop out 90% of your brain and you'd still be just
71920	75120	fine then perhaps you really only do use 10% of it.
75120	76120	Number 7.
76120	77880	Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow.
77880	79960	This one is technically correct but misleading.
79960	82980	Some languages, such as German, like to make compound words by running several smaller
82980	86660	ones together, which is why German words are sometimes absurdly long.
86660	90300	Inuit languages use compound words as well, so rather than say yellow snow, as you would
90300	92940	in English, an Inuit speaker combines the two words into one.
92940	95900	But it's not really a new word, just a quirk of grammar.
95900	99980	So technically Eskimos do have hundreds of ways to describe snow, but then so does every
99980	100980	language.
100980	101980	Number 6.
101980	103180	You need 8 glasses of water a day.
103180	106180	While doubtless some people would benefit from drinking more water and drinking less
106180	110020	crap, there is no scientific evidence that 8 glasses of water a day is the required amount
110020	112280	and some evidence that it might be too much.
112280	114000	And while we're talking about water...
114000	115000	Number 5.
115000	117280	Tap water is bad, but bottled water is good.
117280	121260	If you live in a paradise free from government regulations, like say Somalia, then you might
121260	123920	have good reason to prefer bottled water over tap.
123920	127380	But modern, functioning countries have something called health regulations which cover both
127380	129160	kinds of water.
129160	132920	Also water is extremely dense, making transporting it from those pristine mountain tops and glaciers
132920	136840	enormously expensive, which is why bottled water companies don't bother.
136840	141240	Bottled water is often just local tap water with a fancy label and an enormous markup.
141240	142240	Number 4.
142280	144460	You need 7 years to pass through your digestive system.
144460	147840	This is pretty easy to disprove yourself, but it's understandable why most people don't
147840	149640	try the experiment.
149640	150640	Number 3.
150640	152120	Blood in your veins is blue.
152120	155640	The idea here is that blood in veins is blue and it only turns red when exposed to the
155640	157360	oxygen in the air.
157360	160620	Thinking this isn't unreasonable, after all your veins look blue and medical diagrams
160620	164360	show arteries as red and veins as blue, but it's the same mistake as thinking that Mountain
164360	166920	Dew is green because it's in a green bottle.
166920	170140	Pour it out and you discover that Mountain Dew is really piss yellow, which is probably
170140	172280	why it's in a green bottle to begin with.
172280	174560	The next time you get blood withdrawn from a vein, take a look.
174560	175560	What color is it?
175560	176560	Red.
176560	177860	How much oxygen is inside a good syringe?
177860	178860	None.
178860	181940	Unless you're a horseshoe crab or a plava lagoona, your blood isn't blue.
181940	183120	Number 2.
183120	184120	Fan death.
184120	186260	This misconception is a specialty of South Korea.
186260	189940	Here, the belief is that if you spend too much time with a rotating fan in a confined
189940	193100	space, it will use up all your oxygen and you'll asphyxiate to death.
193100	197940	Exactly how the fan, made of a lifeless anaerobic plastic, competes for your oxygen is unclear,
197940	202180	but hilariously South Korean fan manufacturers, who surely must know better, include timers
202180	204740	on fans to prevent them from running too long.
204740	205740	Number 1.
205740	208380	People swallow 8 spiders a year while sleeping.
208380	211860	Supposedly while you're in bed, helplessly unconscious with your gob wide open, each
211860	216500	year 8 spiders find their way into your mouth and you reflexively swallow them.
216500	218260	This is plainly ridiculous.
218260	221660	Humans love warm, moist places, so 8 is far too low an estimate.
