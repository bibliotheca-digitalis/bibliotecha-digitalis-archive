00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Number 10.

00:05.040 --> 00:08.440
The Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from space.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.800
To see something on Earth from space it would have to be pretty big, which the Great Wall

00:11.800 --> 00:16.040
of China, all 5,000 miles of it, certainly is, but it's only 30 feet across at its

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
widest.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.480
Here's a photo taken from the International Space Station 200 miles above Earth.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.600
Can you spot the Great Wall amid the mountain tops?

00:22.600 --> 00:23.600
Here, right?

00:23.600 --> 00:25.180
No, that's a river.

00:25.180 --> 00:26.920
The wall is actually here.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.140
Even if you guess the right lines by pure luck, this photo was taken with a zoom lens,

00:30.140 --> 00:33.500
so from the window of the International Space Station it would look more like this.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.440
Which pretty clearly makes the Great Wall count as not visible.

00:36.440 --> 00:40.140
As for the man-made part of this misconception, are glorious man-made cities blasting light

00:40.140 --> 00:42.960
into the void certainly are visible.

00:42.960 --> 00:43.960
Number 9.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.440
Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
Socially obnoxious?

00:46.440 --> 00:47.440
Yes.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.440
Gives you arthritis later in life as karmic punishment?

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
No.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.440
Number 8.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.080
People only use 10% of their brain.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.560
If you haven't seen a medical drama in the past, oh, 30 years, you might not be aware

00:56.600 --> 01:00.800
that doctors now have machines that can see inside people's brains and, contrary to popular

01:00.800 --> 01:04.320
belief, 90% of the neurons don't sit around all day doing nothing.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.000
While scientists don't yet know exactly what each part does, they do know that all the

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
bits matter.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.920
So if you think that someone could scoop out 90% of your brain and you'd still be just

01:11.920 --> 01:15.120
fine then perhaps you really only do use 10% of it.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.120
Number 7.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.880
Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.960
This one is technically correct but misleading.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.980
Some languages, such as German, like to make compound words by running several smaller

01:22.980 --> 01:26.660
ones together, which is why German words are sometimes absurdly long.

01:26.660 --> 01:30.300
Inuit languages use compound words as well, so rather than say yellow snow, as you would

01:30.300 --> 01:32.940
in English, an Inuit speaker combines the two words into one.

01:32.940 --> 01:35.900
But it's not really a new word, just a quirk of grammar.

01:35.900 --> 01:39.980
So technically Eskimos do have hundreds of ways to describe snow, but then so does every

01:39.980 --> 01:40.980
language.

01:40.980 --> 01:41.980
Number 6.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.180
You need 8 glasses of water a day.

01:43.180 --> 01:46.180
While doubtless some people would benefit from drinking more water and drinking less

01:46.180 --> 01:50.020
crap, there is no scientific evidence that 8 glasses of water a day is the required amount

01:50.020 --> 01:52.280
and some evidence that it might be too much.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.000
And while we're talking about water...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Number 5.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.280
Tap water is bad, but bottled water is good.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.260
If you live in a paradise free from government regulations, like say Somalia, then you might

02:01.260 --> 02:03.920
have good reason to prefer bottled water over tap.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.380
But modern, functioning countries have something called health regulations which cover both

02:07.380 --> 02:09.160
kinds of water.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.920
Also water is extremely dense, making transporting it from those pristine mountain tops and glaciers

02:12.920 --> 02:16.840
enormously expensive, which is why bottled water companies don't bother.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.240
Bottled water is often just local tap water with a fancy label and an enormous markup.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.240
Number 4.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.460
You need 7 years to pass through your digestive system.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.840
This is pretty easy to disprove yourself, but it's understandable why most people don't

02:27.840 --> 02:29.640
try the experiment.

02:29.640 --> 02:30.640
Number 3.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.120
Blood in your veins is blue.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.640
The idea here is that blood in veins is blue and it only turns red when exposed to the

02:35.640 --> 02:37.360
oxygen in the air.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.620
Thinking this isn't unreasonable, after all your veins look blue and medical diagrams

02:40.620 --> 02:44.360
show arteries as red and veins as blue, but it's the same mistake as thinking that Mountain

02:44.360 --> 02:46.920
Dew is green because it's in a green bottle.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.140
Pour it out and you discover that Mountain Dew is really piss yellow, which is probably

02:50.140 --> 02:52.280
why it's in a green bottle to begin with.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.560
The next time you get blood withdrawn from a vein, take a look.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
What color is it?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
Red.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.860
How much oxygen is inside a good syringe?

02:57.860 --> 02:58.860
None.

02:58.860 --> 03:01.940
Unless you're a horseshoe crab or a plava lagoona, your blood isn't blue.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.120
Number 2.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
Fan death.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.260
This misconception is a specialty of South Korea.

03:06.260 --> 03:09.940
Here, the belief is that if you spend too much time with a rotating fan in a confined

03:09.940 --> 03:13.100
space, it will use up all your oxygen and you'll asphyxiate to death.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.940
Exactly how the fan, made of a lifeless anaerobic plastic, competes for your oxygen is unclear,

03:17.940 --> 03:22.180
but hilariously South Korean fan manufacturers, who surely must know better, include timers

03:22.180 --> 03:24.740
on fans to prevent them from running too long.

03:24.740 --> 03:25.740
Number 1.

03:25.740 --> 03:28.380
People swallow 8 spiders a year while sleeping.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.860
Supposedly while you're in bed, helplessly unconscious with your gob wide open, each

03:31.860 --> 03:36.500
year 8 spiders find their way into your mouth and you reflexively swallow them.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.260
This is plainly ridiculous.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.660
Humans love warm, moist places, so 8 is far too low an estimate.
