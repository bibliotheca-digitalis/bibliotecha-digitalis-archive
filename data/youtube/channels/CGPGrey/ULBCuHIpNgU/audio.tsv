0	2740	This is not the Confederate national flag.
2740	8380	When the United States split in twain during the Civil War, this was the first flag her rebel half used, the Bonnie Blue,
8380	11300	which she copied from the Republic of West Florida.
11300	13060	No, really, this country existed.
13060	19140	A border disagreement between Spain and the US over the Louisiana Purchase gave some local rebels an opportunity to take over a fort in 1810,
19140	26400	declare independence as required with the flag, and run a government for 78 days, until the United States put an end to that.
26400	33600	Anyway, fast forward to the Civil War, and when Mississippi seceded from the Union, she adopted the flag of the tiny country that had been within her borders,
33600	37200	and it became the unofficial flag of the rebellion, but not for long.
37200	39700	Blue wouldn't do. That's a Yankee color.
39700	45700	The new Confederate government asked for flag designs and got several, including one from a German-Prussian artist in Alabama,
45700	49700	who possibly took design cues from the Austrian Empire and Betsy Ross.
49700	54000	Side note here, while we're talking about misnamed flags, Betsy Ross probably didn't design this flag.
54000	60500	There's no evidence to support that she did, only stories from long after she died, Lady Godiva style, but we're getting off track here.
60500	64500	The Confederate government selected this as her official flag and named it the Stars and Bars,
64500	68000	so calling this the Stars and Bars is wrong on two counts.
68000	71900	That's not its name, and this is a cross. These are bars.
71900	79100	New flag adopted, off to war, but on the battlefield, the flag's similarity with the Union's was confusing, what with the terror and the smoke.
79100	83300	Nonetheless, the Confederacy stuck with her flag, but her army wanted to avoid friendly fire,
83300	87200	and so took one of their rejected designs and squarefied it into a battle flag.
87200	92900	The Navy, too, liked this design and eventually switched, though using a brighter, presumably non-Yankee, blue.
92900	98600	The popularity of the official flag decreased in the Confederacy as time went on, even though they kept increasing the stars,
98600	101000	while the popularity of the battle flag grew.
101000	106900	So in 1863, the Confederate government tried again and went with white, sticking the battle flag in the corner.
106900	110300	This was better in the sense that the flag looked less like the Yankees,
110300	114600	but worse in that the international symbol of surrender was now in the background.
114600	116100	The army stuck with theirs.
116100	121500	Two years later, the Confederate government again changed the flag, adding a red bar and a new, tough name.
121500	124300	Also, the design slightly rectangularified the battle flag.
124300	131500	This could no longer be mistaken for surrender and was the last flag as, 36 days later, the Confederacy surrendered.
131500	137400	So this design was never technically the flag of the Confederate government, but close enough.
