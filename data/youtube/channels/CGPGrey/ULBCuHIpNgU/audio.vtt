00:00.000 --> 00:02.740
This is not the Confederate national flag.

00:02.740 --> 00:08.380
When the United States split in twain during the Civil War, this was the first flag her rebel half used, the Bonnie Blue,

00:08.380 --> 00:11.300
which she copied from the Republic of West Florida.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.060
No, really, this country existed.

00:13.060 --> 00:19.140
A border disagreement between Spain and the US over the Louisiana Purchase gave some local rebels an opportunity to take over a fort in 1810,

00:19.140 --> 00:26.400
declare independence as required with the flag, and run a government for 78 days, until the United States put an end to that.

00:26.400 --> 00:33.600
Anyway, fast forward to the Civil War, and when Mississippi seceded from the Union, she adopted the flag of the tiny country that had been within her borders,

00:33.600 --> 00:37.200
and it became the unofficial flag of the rebellion, but not for long.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.700
Blue wouldn't do. That's a Yankee color.

00:39.700 --> 00:45.700
The new Confederate government asked for flag designs and got several, including one from a German-Prussian artist in Alabama,

00:45.700 --> 00:49.700
who possibly took design cues from the Austrian Empire and Betsy Ross.

00:49.700 --> 00:54.000
Side note here, while we're talking about misnamed flags, Betsy Ross probably didn't design this flag.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.500
There's no evidence to support that she did, only stories from long after she died, Lady Godiva style, but we're getting off track here.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.500
The Confederate government selected this as her official flag and named it the Stars and Bars,

01:04.500 --> 01:08.000
so calling this the Stars and Bars is wrong on two counts.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.900
That's not its name, and this is a cross. These are bars.

01:11.900 --> 01:19.100
New flag adopted, off to war, but on the battlefield, the flag's similarity with the Union's was confusing, what with the terror and the smoke.

01:19.100 --> 01:23.300
Nonetheless, the Confederacy stuck with her flag, but her army wanted to avoid friendly fire,

01:23.300 --> 01:27.200
and so took one of their rejected designs and squarefied it into a battle flag.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.900
The Navy, too, liked this design and eventually switched, though using a brighter, presumably non-Yankee, blue.

01:32.900 --> 01:38.600
The popularity of the official flag decreased in the Confederacy as time went on, even though they kept increasing the stars,

01:38.600 --> 01:41.000
while the popularity of the battle flag grew.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.900
So in 1863, the Confederate government tried again and went with white, sticking the battle flag in the corner.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.300
This was better in the sense that the flag looked less like the Yankees,

01:50.300 --> 01:54.600
but worse in that the international symbol of surrender was now in the background.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.100
The army stuck with theirs.

01:56.100 --> 02:01.500
Two years later, the Confederate government again changed the flag, adding a red bar and a new, tough name.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.300
Also, the design slightly rectangularified the battle flag.

02:04.300 --> 02:11.500
This could no longer be mistaken for surrender and was the last flag as, 36 days later, the Confederacy surrendered.

02:11.500 --> 02:17.400
So this design was never technically the flag of the Confederate government, but close enough.
