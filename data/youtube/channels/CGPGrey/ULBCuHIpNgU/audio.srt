1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
This is not the Confederate national flag.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,380
When the United States split in twain during the Civil War, this was the first flag her rebel half used, the Bonnie Blue,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,300
which she copied from the Republic of West Florida.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,060
No, really, this country existed.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:19,140
A border disagreement between Spain and the US over the Louisiana Purchase gave some local rebels an opportunity to take over a fort in 1810,

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,400
declare independence as required with the flag, and run a government for 78 days, until the United States put an end to that.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,600
Anyway, fast forward to the Civil War, and when Mississippi seceded from the Union, she adopted the flag of the tiny country that had been within her borders,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
and it became the unofficial flag of the rebellion, but not for long.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,700
Blue wouldn't do. That's a Yankee color.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,700
The new Confederate government asked for flag designs and got several, including one from a German-Prussian artist in Alabama,

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,700
who possibly took design cues from the Austrian Empire and Betsy Ross.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,000
Side note here, while we're talking about misnamed flags, Betsy Ross probably didn't design this flag.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,500
There's no evidence to support that she did, only stories from long after she died, Lady Godiva style, but we're getting off track here.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
The Confederate government selected this as her official flag and named it the Stars and Bars,

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,000
so calling this the Stars and Bars is wrong on two counts.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,900
That's not its name, and this is a cross. These are bars.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,100
New flag adopted, off to war, but on the battlefield, the flag's similarity with the Union's was confusing, what with the terror and the smoke.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,300
Nonetheless, the Confederacy stuck with her flag, but her army wanted to avoid friendly fire,

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,200
and so took one of their rejected designs and squarefied it into a battle flag.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,900
The Navy, too, liked this design and eventually switched, though using a brighter, presumably non-Yankee, blue.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,600
The popularity of the official flag decreased in the Confederacy as time went on, even though they kept increasing the stars,

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,000
while the popularity of the battle flag grew.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,900
So in 1863, the Confederate government tried again and went with white, sticking the battle flag in the corner.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,300
This was better in the sense that the flag looked less like the Yankees,

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,600
but worse in that the international symbol of surrender was now in the background.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,100
The army stuck with theirs.

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,500
Two years later, the Confederate government again changed the flag, adding a red bar and a new, tough name.

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,300
Also, the design slightly rectangularified the battle flag.

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:11,500
This could no longer be mistaken for surrender and was the last flag as, 36 days later, the Confederacy surrendered.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,400
So this design was never technically the flag of the Confederate government, but close enough.
