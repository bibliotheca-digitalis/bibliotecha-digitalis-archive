0	5160	Americans love their independence, a nation of pioneers living out from under the eye of government.
5160	6640	Except for all the government.
6640	10620	As such, unlike many other countries, Americans don't have a national ID card,
10620	15800	and even the idea of creating one is a political hot topic every election cycle.
15800	17460	The results are always the same.
17460	19580	We don't need no ID card.
19580	23300	But, suspiciously, US citizens do already have this.
23300	27440	A card with a unique number that many places will ask for to prove who you are.
27480	30120	This is the Social Security card and number,
30120	35100	and it has become a quasi-ID stroke unique password to identify citizens.
35100	37480	Though, that was never its intended use.
37480	40480	For Americans, keeping this number secret is super important,
40480	44880	because it's the key to the government and banks identifying you as you.
44880	49160	And losing control of it is the worst kind of identity theft that can happen.
49160	52520	So how did Americans end up with a national ID number that isn't one,
52520	55400	and a card terribly unfit to identify?
55400	58120	It all started in the Great Depression of long, long ago,
58120	62240	when the government created the Social Security program, a kind of mandatory pension.
62240	65120	Citizens would be required to pay in during their working lives,
65120	66800	and withdraw in their retirement.
66800	71160	The idea being that even if past you didn't save for the sunset years of future you,
71160	75000	the eventually old current you would still have something to live on.
75000	78000	Now, if you want to think of Social Security as a benefit the government provides,
78000	81160	or as a bank account that's yours, is controversial.
81160	86280	But either way, this number was created to track what you put in and what you take out.
86280	90360	Now, because this was just one government program related only to your working life,
90360	94760	you only needed to apply for a Social Security card when you actually started working.
94760	97840	But over time, that changed, and the younger you are,
97840	101080	the more likely you've had one from the moment of your birth,
101080	103720	despite babies' worthlessness as child laborers.
103720	104520	So why?
104520	108760	Well, it goes back to Americans having no national identity card with a national number,
108760	112960	which makes it harder for institutions to keep track of people over their lives.
112960	116360	With hundreds of millions of citizens, names and birthdays aren't unique.
116360	119080	People move, people marry, people change names.
119080	121240	And if you're trying to keep track of everyone,
121240	123640	as, say, the United States Tax Department might want to do,
123640	127880	it can be a real problem, particularly in the pre-computer days.
127880	132760	Hey, wait a minute, look at this number just lying around, the Tax Department said.
132760	135680	It's not supposed to be used as an ID number, said the Social Security Department.
135680	137440	There are security reasons you should yoink.
137440	141160	Thus, the Tax Department piggybacked off of the work the Social Security Department did
141160	145200	assigning working adults a number, which made tracking taxes easier,
145200	150000	and they highly encouraged parents to get a Social Security number for their children
150000	152320	by tying it to a tax discount.
152320	156800	Crazily, counting children for tax rebates used to run on the honor system.
156800	158320	The US Tax Department told people,
158320	161440	1. We will give you a discount on your taxes for each child you have,
161440	164400	and 2. Write down your number of children.
164400	167160	Please be honest, we don't have a way to check.
167160	170920	Which was just asking, nay, begging people to lie,
170920	174920	which they did, birthing on paper millions of phantom children.
174920	178520	But after requiring each kid to have a Social Security account number
178520	182640	connected to a birth certificate before the parents could get the tax discount,
182640	185160	all those phantoms faded away.
185160	188320	This turned the Social Security number into a unique number
188320	190760	that all citizens had right from the start,
190760	192880	and that made it easy for lots of other places,
192880	195280	like banks and schools and companies and landlords,
195280	199160	to also piggyback on the number as an easy way to keep track of people
199160	201480	without having to come up with their own systems,
201480	206160	and to be able to exchange information about people between institutions.
206160	208840	This is super useful for institutions,
208840	212840	so the desire of Americans to not have a national identity card
212840	217920	led, somewhat inevitably, to the nearest thing available being used as a substitute.
217920	220240	Which ended up being worse because the Social Security number
220240	223640	was never designed to be used this way in the long, long ago,
223640	227160	and you can tell because it has no security built into it.
227160	229600	Okay, so there's this neat trick that most ID numbers use,
229600	232360	where they can check themselves to see if they're invalid.
232360	235880	The simplest way is to have the last couple digits match the sum of the others.
235880	238600	All kinds of ID cards and barcodes do this
238600	242400	because it makes it impossible to enter an incorrect number in a computer,
242400	245520	and makes it harder for fraudsters to guess valid numbers.
245520	249640	This is why, if you try to buy something online by guessing a credit card number,
249640	253320	the website knows it's invalid before you even click Buy.
253320	256920	But because the Social Security number started life in the long, long ago,
256920	260920	it's just a number with no self-checking security built in.
260920	265880	Worse, if you're born pre-2011, it's not that hard to just guess most of the number.
265880	269000	The first three digits are the state where the parents applied for the card,
269000	271920	and the last four digits just count up in order,
271920	274640	and the middle digits follow a regular pattern.
274640	277800	So you can take your number, subtract one,
277800	282800	and that's a valid number of someone who was probably born in the same hospital as you
282800	284200	around the same time.
284200	287040	Thus, a fraudster who knows your time and location of birth
287040	290880	can probably get the first five digits by just looking them up on a chart.
290880	295440	Institutions ask for the last four digits as a code to identify you as you,
295440	300280	which means it's not that hard to put together your number from a security leak anywhere,
300280	302760	or just by connecting a few puzzle pieces.
302760	305640	The physical card itself is no help either,
305640	310240	just a literal piece of cardboard, depending on when it was issued, not even laminated.
310280	311960	The Social Security Department used to print
311960	314080	not to be used for identification on the cards
314080	317280	as a futile attempt to stop institutions for asking for them as IDs,
317280	321160	because there's nothing identifying a person on the card.
321160	323440	But eventually, they gave up and removed these words,
323440	326160	because unlike passports or a driver's license,
326160	330200	you can assume all Americans will have this one card.
330200	332760	All this means your Social Security card and number
332760	336240	probably have less security than your library card,
336240	338560	while being vastly more important.
338560	343160	So it fails at being a secure number, it fails at being a good ID card,
343160	346400	but at least it is universal, which is why people use it.
346400	348960	Oh, hello, asterisk, my old friend.
348960	351920	No, of course not, this program isn't actually universal.
351920	354400	Not everyone has a Social Security account number,
354400	356520	and not everyone pays into the program.
356520	358920	If you want to get out of paying, you'll just need to first
358920	360760	never have received any Social Security benefits
360760	363720	and give up your rights to getting any in the future, which seems fair.
363720	367840	In addition, you must also be a member of a religion opposed to the idea of Social Security,
367840	371520	usually because it's a kind of insurance, and insurance is a kind of gambling.
371520	374840	That's harder, but you could always just start your own religion
374840	377600	if you were really serious about avoiding taxes.
377600	381840	But your new religion must also provide for its elderly and dependent members,
381840	385880	which means you have to recreate a Social Security program of sorts in your religion,
385880	387880	while also being against Social Security.
387880	390320	But if creating a contradictory religion doesn't daunt you,
390320	393840	lastly, it must have existed continuously since 1950,
393840	396120	which is a giveaway that this exception was written
396120	398880	pretty much exclusively for the Amish and Mennonites,
398880	403920	and kills dead your plans unless you're willing to undergo a serious change in lifestyle.
403920	405160	It doesn't stop there.
405160	408600	Keep digging, and you'll find all sorts of other weird, weird exceptions,
408600	413600	including some railroad workers, or firefighters, or police, or teachers, but only in Chicago.
413600	415960	Usually these are groups that in the long, long ago
415960	419320	were able to get out of the program at its creation date.
419320	421440	So, nothing's ever straightforward.
421440	424200	And that's the deal with this Social Security card,
424200	426920	containing a national number for citizens that don't want one
426920	429680	on an identification card that fails at identification,
429680	431920	given to all citizens, except when it isn't,
431920	435320	for a program that's universal, except when it's not.
