1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Americans love their independence, a nation of pioneers living out from under the eye of government.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,640
Except for all the government.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,620
As such, unlike many other countries, Americans don't have a national ID card,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,800
and even the idea of creating one is a political hot topic every election cycle.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,460
The results are always the same.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,580
We don't need no ID card.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,300
But, suspiciously, US citizens do already have this.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,440
A card with a unique number that many places will ask for to prove who you are.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,120
This is the Social Security card and number,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,100
and it has become a quasi-ID stroke unique password to identify citizens.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,480
Though, that was never its intended use.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,480
For Americans, keeping this number secret is super important,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,880
because it's the key to the government and banks identifying you as you.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,160
And losing control of it is the worst kind of identity theft that can happen.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,520
So how did Americans end up with a national ID number that isn't one,

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,400
and a card terribly unfit to identify?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,120
It all started in the Great Depression of long, long ago,

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,240
when the government created the Social Security program, a kind of mandatory pension.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,120
Citizens would be required to pay in during their working lives,

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,800
and withdraw in their retirement.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,160
The idea being that even if past you didn't save for the sunset years of future you,

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,000
the eventually old current you would still have something to live on.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, if you want to think of Social Security as a benefit the government provides,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,160
or as a bank account that's yours, is controversial.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,280
But either way, this number was created to track what you put in and what you take out.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,360
Now, because this was just one government program related only to your working life,

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,760
you only needed to apply for a Social Security card when you actually started working.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,840
But over time, that changed, and the younger you are,

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,080
the more likely you've had one from the moment of your birth,

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,720
despite babies' worthlessness as child laborers.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
So why?

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,760
Well, it goes back to Americans having no national identity card with a national number,

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,960
which makes it harder for institutions to keep track of people over their lives.

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,360
With hundreds of millions of citizens, names and birthdays aren't unique.

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,080
People move, people marry, people change names.

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,240
And if you're trying to keep track of everyone,

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,640
as, say, the United States Tax Department might want to do,

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,880
it can be a real problem, particularly in the pre-computer days.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,760
Hey, wait a minute, look at this number just lying around, the Tax Department said.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,680
It's not supposed to be used as an ID number, said the Social Security Department.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
There are security reasons you should yoink.

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,160
Thus, the Tax Department piggybacked off of the work the Social Security Department did

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,200
assigning working adults a number, which made tracking taxes easier,

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,000
and they highly encouraged parents to get a Social Security number for their children

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,320
by tying it to a tax discount.

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,800
Crazily, counting children for tax rebates used to run on the honor system.

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,320
The US Tax Department told people,

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,440
1. We will give you a discount on your taxes for each child you have,

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
and 2. Write down your number of children.

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Please be honest, we don't have a way to check.

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Which was just asking, nay, begging people to lie,

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,920
which they did, birthing on paper millions of phantom children.

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,520
But after requiring each kid to have a Social Security account number

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,640
connected to a birth certificate before the parents could get the tax discount,

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,160
all those phantoms faded away.

56
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,320
This turned the Social Security number into a unique number

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,760
that all citizens had right from the start,

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,880
and that made it easy for lots of other places,

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,280
like banks and schools and companies and landlords,

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,160
to also piggyback on the number as an easy way to keep track of people

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,480
without having to come up with their own systems,

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,160
and to be able to exchange information about people between institutions.

63
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,840
This is super useful for institutions,

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,840
so the desire of Americans to not have a national identity card

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,920
led, somewhat inevitably, to the nearest thing available being used as a substitute.

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Which ended up being worse because the Social Security number

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,640
was never designed to be used this way in the long, long ago,

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,160
and you can tell because it has no security built into it.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,600
Okay, so there's this neat trick that most ID numbers use,

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,360
where they can check themselves to see if they're invalid.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,880
The simplest way is to have the last couple digits match the sum of the others.

72
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,600
All kinds of ID cards and barcodes do this

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,400
because it makes it impossible to enter an incorrect number in a computer,

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,520
and makes it harder for fraudsters to guess valid numbers.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,640
This is why, if you try to buy something online by guessing a credit card number,

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,320
the website knows it's invalid before you even click Buy.

77
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,920
But because the Social Security number started life in the long, long ago,

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,920
it's just a number with no self-checking security built in.

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,880
Worse, if you're born pre-2011, it's not that hard to just guess most of the number.

80
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,000
The first three digits are the state where the parents applied for the card,

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,920
and the last four digits just count up in order,

82
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,640
and the middle digits follow a regular pattern.

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,800
So you can take your number, subtract one,

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,800
and that's a valid number of someone who was probably born in the same hospital as you

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
around the same time.

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,040
Thus, a fraudster who knows your time and location of birth

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
can probably get the first five digits by just looking them up on a chart.

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,440
Institutions ask for the last four digits as a code to identify you as you,

89
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,280
which means it's not that hard to put together your number from a security leak anywhere,

90
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,760
or just by connecting a few puzzle pieces.

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,640
The physical card itself is no help either,

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,240
just a literal piece of cardboard, depending on when it was issued, not even laminated.

93
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,960
The Social Security Department used to print

94
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,080
not to be used for identification on the cards

95
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
as a futile attempt to stop institutions for asking for them as IDs,

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,160
because there's nothing identifying a person on the card.

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,440
But eventually, they gave up and removed these words,

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
because unlike passports or a driver's license,

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,200
you can assume all Americans will have this one card.

100
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,760
All this means your Social Security card and number

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,240
probably have less security than your library card,

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
while being vastly more important.

103
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,160
So it fails at being a secure number, it fails at being a good ID card,

104
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,400
but at least it is universal, which is why people use it.

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
Oh, hello, asterisk, my old friend.

106
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,920
No, of course not, this program isn't actually universal.

107
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,400
Not everyone has a Social Security account number,

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,520
and not everyone pays into the program.

109
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,920
If you want to get out of paying, you'll just need to first

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,760
never have received any Social Security benefits

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,720
and give up your rights to getting any in the future, which seems fair.

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,840
In addition, you must also be a member of a religion opposed to the idea of Social Security,

113
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,520
usually because it's a kind of insurance, and insurance is a kind of gambling.

114
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,840
That's harder, but you could always just start your own religion

115
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,600
if you were really serious about avoiding taxes.

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
But your new religion must also provide for its elderly and dependent members,

117
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,880
which means you have to recreate a Social Security program of sorts in your religion,

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
while also being against Social Security.

119
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,320
But if creating a contradictory religion doesn't daunt you,

120
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,840
lastly, it must have existed continuously since 1950,

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,120
which is a giveaway that this exception was written

122
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,880
pretty much exclusively for the Amish and Mennonites,

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,920
and kills dead your plans unless you're willing to undergo a serious change in lifestyle.

124
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
It doesn't stop there.

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,600
Keep digging, and you'll find all sorts of other weird, weird exceptions,

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,600
including some railroad workers, or firefighters, or police, or teachers, but only in Chicago.

127
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,960
Usually these are groups that in the long, long ago

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,320
were able to get out of the program at its creation date.

129
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,440
So, nothing's ever straightforward.

130
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,200
And that's the deal with this Social Security card,

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,920
containing a national number for citizens that don't want one

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,680
on an identification card that fails at identification,

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
given to all citizens, except when it isn't,

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,320
for a program that's universal, except when it's not.
