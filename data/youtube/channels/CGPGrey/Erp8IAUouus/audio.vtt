00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
Americans love their independence, a nation of pioneers living out from under the eye of government.

00:05.160 --> 00:06.640
Except for all the government.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.620
As such, unlike many other countries, Americans don't have a national ID card,

00:10.620 --> 00:15.800
and even the idea of creating one is a political hot topic every election cycle.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.460
The results are always the same.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.580
We don't need no ID card.

00:19.580 --> 00:23.300
But, suspiciously, US citizens do already have this.

00:23.300 --> 00:27.440
A card with a unique number that many places will ask for to prove who you are.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.120
This is the Social Security card and number,

00:30.120 --> 00:35.100
and it has become a quasi-ID stroke unique password to identify citizens.

00:35.100 --> 00:37.480
Though, that was never its intended use.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.480
For Americans, keeping this number secret is super important,

00:40.480 --> 00:44.880
because it's the key to the government and banks identifying you as you.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.160
And losing control of it is the worst kind of identity theft that can happen.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.520
So how did Americans end up with a national ID number that isn't one,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.400
and a card terribly unfit to identify?

00:55.400 --> 00:58.120
It all started in the Great Depression of long, long ago,

00:58.120 --> 01:02.240
when the government created the Social Security program, a kind of mandatory pension.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.120
Citizens would be required to pay in during their working lives,

01:05.120 --> 01:06.800
and withdraw in their retirement.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.160
The idea being that even if past you didn't save for the sunset years of future you,

01:11.160 --> 01:15.000
the eventually old current you would still have something to live on.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Now, if you want to think of Social Security as a benefit the government provides,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.160
or as a bank account that's yours, is controversial.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.280
But either way, this number was created to track what you put in and what you take out.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.360
Now, because this was just one government program related only to your working life,

01:30.360 --> 01:34.760
you only needed to apply for a Social Security card when you actually started working.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.840
But over time, that changed, and the younger you are,

01:37.840 --> 01:41.080
the more likely you've had one from the moment of your birth,

01:41.080 --> 01:43.720
despite babies' worthlessness as child laborers.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.520
So why?

01:44.520 --> 01:48.760
Well, it goes back to Americans having no national identity card with a national number,

01:48.760 --> 01:52.960
which makes it harder for institutions to keep track of people over their lives.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.360
With hundreds of millions of citizens, names and birthdays aren't unique.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.080
People move, people marry, people change names.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.240
And if you're trying to keep track of everyone,

02:01.240 --> 02:03.640
as, say, the United States Tax Department might want to do,

02:03.640 --> 02:07.880
it can be a real problem, particularly in the pre-computer days.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.760
Hey, wait a minute, look at this number just lying around, the Tax Department said.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.680
It's not supposed to be used as an ID number, said the Social Security Department.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.440
There are security reasons you should yoink.

02:17.440 --> 02:21.160
Thus, the Tax Department piggybacked off of the work the Social Security Department did

02:21.160 --> 02:25.200
assigning working adults a number, which made tracking taxes easier,

02:25.200 --> 02:30.000
and they highly encouraged parents to get a Social Security number for their children

02:30.000 --> 02:32.320
by tying it to a tax discount.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.800
Crazily, counting children for tax rebates used to run on the honor system.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.320
The US Tax Department told people,

02:38.320 --> 02:41.440
1. We will give you a discount on your taxes for each child you have,

02:41.440 --> 02:44.400
and 2. Write down your number of children.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.160
Please be honest, we don't have a way to check.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.920
Which was just asking, nay, begging people to lie,

02:50.920 --> 02:54.920
which they did, birthing on paper millions of phantom children.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.520
But after requiring each kid to have a Social Security account number

02:58.520 --> 03:02.640
connected to a birth certificate before the parents could get the tax discount,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.160
all those phantoms faded away.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.320
This turned the Social Security number into a unique number

03:08.320 --> 03:10.760
that all citizens had right from the start,

03:10.760 --> 03:12.880
and that made it easy for lots of other places,

03:12.880 --> 03:15.280
like banks and schools and companies and landlords,

03:15.280 --> 03:19.160
to also piggyback on the number as an easy way to keep track of people

03:19.160 --> 03:21.480
without having to come up with their own systems,

03:21.480 --> 03:26.160
and to be able to exchange information about people between institutions.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.840
This is super useful for institutions,

03:28.840 --> 03:32.840
so the desire of Americans to not have a national identity card

03:32.840 --> 03:37.920
led, somewhat inevitably, to the nearest thing available being used as a substitute.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.240
Which ended up being worse because the Social Security number

03:40.240 --> 03:43.640
was never designed to be used this way in the long, long ago,

03:43.640 --> 03:47.160
and you can tell because it has no security built into it.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.600
Okay, so there's this neat trick that most ID numbers use,

03:49.600 --> 03:52.360
where they can check themselves to see if they're invalid.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.880
The simplest way is to have the last couple digits match the sum of the others.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.600
All kinds of ID cards and barcodes do this

03:58.600 --> 04:02.400
because it makes it impossible to enter an incorrect number in a computer,

04:02.400 --> 04:05.520
and makes it harder for fraudsters to guess valid numbers.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.640
This is why, if you try to buy something online by guessing a credit card number,

04:09.640 --> 04:13.320
the website knows it's invalid before you even click Buy.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.920
But because the Social Security number started life in the long, long ago,

04:16.920 --> 04:20.920
it's just a number with no self-checking security built in.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.880
Worse, if you're born pre-2011, it's not that hard to just guess most of the number.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.000
The first three digits are the state where the parents applied for the card,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.920
and the last four digits just count up in order,

04:31.920 --> 04:34.640
and the middle digits follow a regular pattern.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.800
So you can take your number, subtract one,

04:37.800 --> 04:42.800
and that's a valid number of someone who was probably born in the same hospital as you

04:42.800 --> 04:44.200
around the same time.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.040
Thus, a fraudster who knows your time and location of birth

04:47.040 --> 04:50.880
can probably get the first five digits by just looking them up on a chart.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.440
Institutions ask for the last four digits as a code to identify you as you,

04:55.440 --> 05:00.280
which means it's not that hard to put together your number from a security leak anywhere,

05:00.280 --> 05:02.760
or just by connecting a few puzzle pieces.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.640
The physical card itself is no help either,

05:05.640 --> 05:10.240
just a literal piece of cardboard, depending on when it was issued, not even laminated.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.960
The Social Security Department used to print

05:11.960 --> 05:14.080
not to be used for identification on the cards

05:14.080 --> 05:17.280
as a futile attempt to stop institutions for asking for them as IDs,

05:17.280 --> 05:21.160
because there's nothing identifying a person on the card.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.440
But eventually, they gave up and removed these words,

05:23.440 --> 05:26.160
because unlike passports or a driver's license,

05:26.160 --> 05:30.200
you can assume all Americans will have this one card.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.760
All this means your Social Security card and number

05:32.760 --> 05:36.240
probably have less security than your library card,

05:36.240 --> 05:38.560
while being vastly more important.

05:38.560 --> 05:43.160
So it fails at being a secure number, it fails at being a good ID card,

05:43.160 --> 05:46.400
but at least it is universal, which is why people use it.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.960
Oh, hello, asterisk, my old friend.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.920
No, of course not, this program isn't actually universal.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.400
Not everyone has a Social Security account number,

05:54.400 --> 05:56.520
and not everyone pays into the program.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.920
If you want to get out of paying, you'll just need to first

05:58.920 --> 06:00.760
never have received any Social Security benefits

06:00.760 --> 06:03.720
and give up your rights to getting any in the future, which seems fair.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.840
In addition, you must also be a member of a religion opposed to the idea of Social Security,

06:07.840 --> 06:11.520
usually because it's a kind of insurance, and insurance is a kind of gambling.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.840
That's harder, but you could always just start your own religion

06:14.840 --> 06:17.600
if you were really serious about avoiding taxes.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.840
But your new religion must also provide for its elderly and dependent members,

06:21.840 --> 06:25.880
which means you have to recreate a Social Security program of sorts in your religion,

06:25.880 --> 06:27.880
while also being against Social Security.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.320
But if creating a contradictory religion doesn't daunt you,

06:30.320 --> 06:33.840
lastly, it must have existed continuously since 1950,

06:33.840 --> 06:36.120
which is a giveaway that this exception was written

06:36.120 --> 06:38.880
pretty much exclusively for the Amish and Mennonites,

06:38.880 --> 06:43.920
and kills dead your plans unless you're willing to undergo a serious change in lifestyle.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.160
It doesn't stop there.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.600
Keep digging, and you'll find all sorts of other weird, weird exceptions,

06:48.600 --> 06:53.600
including some railroad workers, or firefighters, or police, or teachers, but only in Chicago.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.960
Usually these are groups that in the long, long ago

06:55.960 --> 06:59.320
were able to get out of the program at its creation date.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.440
So, nothing's ever straightforward.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.200
And that's the deal with this Social Security card,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.920
containing a national number for citizens that don't want one

07:06.920 --> 07:09.680
on an identification card that fails at identification,

07:09.680 --> 07:11.920
given to all citizens, except when it isn't,

07:11.920 --> 07:15.320
for a program that's universal, except when it's not.
