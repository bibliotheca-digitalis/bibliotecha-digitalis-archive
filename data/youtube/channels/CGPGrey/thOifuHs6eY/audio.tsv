0	3760	You know, hexagons are the bestagons.
3760	5760	Why? Because bees.
5760	9240	Bees are the best and build only the bestagon, the hexagon.
9240	10480	Now, I know what you're thinking.
10480	14120	Bees build hexagons because they're hexapods with hexagon eyes.
14120	15720	How could they do otherwise?
15720	16800	Excellent point.
16800	19760	But the Humbobumble has an engineering problem to solve.
19760	21040	She makes two things.
21040	22080	Honey and wax.
22080	25000	The former to eat and the latter to contain the former.
25000	28480	To make but a little honey, she must visit a lot of flowers.
28480	31720	And to make one unit of wax, she needs eight units of honey.
31720	35760	Wax is costly for bees in flower terms and honey is drippy in food terms.
35760	41280	So to make a hive that contains the maximum honey while using the minimum wax is royally vital.
41280	43120	Thus, a honeycomb conjecture.
43120	44720	Which shape works best?
44720	46480	To answer, we need to talk tiles.
46480	49360	Tiling is covering a surface with a pattern of polygons.
49360	52160	There's lots of options because there's lots of polygons.
52160	54440	Even the regulars go on and on again.
54440	59480	Now for bees picking patterns, the more complicated ones obviously use more lines than necessary.
59480	61160	That's what complicated means.
61160	64680	And thus a honeycomb of that tile would use more wax per honey.
64680	68240	So sticking to the simple regulars, there are just three that tile tightly.
68240	69840	Triangle, square, and hexagon.
69840	73360	Pentagons are broken hexagons leaving gaps, same with septagons.
73360	75760	Octagons are alright, but they're no hexagon.
75760	78440	Which leaves the tiling trio which tile differently.
78440	82160	A square is a square of squares, which is a square of squares, and so on.
82160	84320	Squares tile tightly by basically cheating,
84320	87920	covering an infinite plane with an infinite number of parallel lines.
87920	90880	Like, wow, that's what a plane is.
90880	91760	Boring!
91760	95520	Triangles pull the same trick, dividing themselves down into infinite nothing.
95520	96960	But not the hexagon.
96960	102000	The only regular polygon to tile a plane without resorting to debasing self-division.
102000	103680	Unlike some squares I could mention.
103680	107120	At least triangle is trying to be more geometrically interesting than square,
107120	109760	teaming up a bit to one, two, three, four, five, six-
109760	110640	Wait, hexagon!
110640	112000	The other shapes can't help it.
112000	114080	They just want to be the bestagon.
114080	117040	Even some of the irregulars like rhombus tile by hexagoning.
117040	121200	Same with your trackus tiles, and deltoid trihexanoggles,
121200	126560	and your, uh, crystal rombles, and florid pentanoggles.
126560	127920	Look, they're all just hexagons.
127920	133200	Even kyro tiles, poor pentagons tile up as best they can to form a lumpy hexagon.
133200	135920	The rest just can't compete with the best.
135920	139760	The hexagon nobly indivisible is the bestagon.
139760	140880	Uh, where were we?
140880	142240	Oh right, honeycomb conjecture.
142240	144400	Max honey, min wax, three options.
144400	149120	Okay, yes, there's the circle, a shape defined by the least perimeter for the most area,
149120	151120	but that only works when you need just one.
151120	153680	Pack circles and this is the best they can do.
153680	155040	Look at all that wasted space.
155040	157920	And even if you pack the gaps, you still use more wax.
157920	160240	And again, the way these circles arrange themselves,
160240	162960	it's almost like, one, two, three, four, five, six, hidden hexagon.
162960	168560	Bees use the hexagon because no shape is better to create the maximum area for the minimum wall.
168560	173600	And this min-max stat of hexagon is one of the many reasons they show up everywhere,
173600	176240	including in the aforementioned bee's eyes.
176240	180400	Each hexagon is a long tube that leads to the light-catching cells at the bottom.
180400	182000	More light equals better vision,
182000	186240	and hexagons let the most light in using the least amount of wall.
186240	188400	So why aren't your eyes hexagons?
188400	191200	Au contraire mon ami, they are le hexagon.
191200	194080	Not on the outside, but on the inside.
194080	196880	Your light-catching cells are at the back of your eye,
196880	199840	in a hexagonal grid for the same reason as bees.
199840	201360	Max light, min wall.
201360	204560	Your window to the world is but through the hexagon.
204560	206640	Does that not make it the bestagon?
206640	209680	Okay, maybe hexagon as min-maxagon doesn't catch your fancy.
209680	211600	Then how about a little mystery, oui?
211600	213440	Let us travel to Saturn.
213440	217520	Yes, the rings are attention-grabbing, but leave the equator, travel north,
217520	219440	and here lies the unexplained.
219440	221360	The great hexagon of Saturn.
221360	222480	Need something for scale?
222480	223840	Well, here's the Earth.
223840	226080	Oh, here's six the Earths.
226080	228720	Saturn's hexagon is pretty big.
228720	229440	What is it?
229440	232080	Well, you might be thinking it's a geological formation,
232080	236080	an enormous basalt column like the smaller versions you find on Earth.
236080	237920	But no, Saturn is a gas giant.
237920	240640	There is no surface or geology to speak of,
240640	244160	so the great hexagon is composed of shapeless clouds
244160	247200	somehow keeping shape and changing color.
247200	249680	It's a magnificent solar system mystery.
249680	251760	And while I'm no space archaeologist,
251760	254720	if I was looking for an alien-gifted monolith,
254720	259920	on the most look-at-me planet under a hexagon beacon with Earth-sized sides,
259920	261200	that's where I would start.
261200	265760	After all, what aliens would want to make first contact with the nearby monkeys
265760	269760	before they became enlightened to pursue the universal truth?
269760	271760	Hexagon is the bestagon.
271760	274480	From the largest down to the smallest.
274480	277280	Say, for example, this tiny snowflake I happen to have.
277280	280080	That has six sides as all snowflakes do.
280080	281600	Gee, what could cause that to be?
281600	284160	Let's zoom down to the atomic realm and see.
284160	286560	When water molecules join together to make a flake,
286560	289200	the sturdy shape they prefer is the hexagon.
289200	292400	As more molecules join, they extend the flake fractally up.
292400	294720	The beauty of the snowflake on the monkey scale
294720	298720	is but an extension of the hexagonal perfection on the atomic scale.
298720	301840	Okay, yes, you will sometimes find snowflakes with 12 sides,
301840	304400	but this happens when two growing snowflakes get stuck together,
304400	305280	so it still counts.
305280	308880	And the hexagon isn't just for snow, but for all ice 1h,
308880	311120	which means basically all ice on Earth.
311120	312560	Yeah, there's a little ice 1c,
312560	314720	which we don't talk about because it's made of cubes
314720	317360	and cubes are boring and there's a bit of ice 9.
317360	318080	No, don't touch that.
318080	319520	But if there is ice in your drink,
319520	322080	give thanks to the hexagon for keeping it cool.
322080	323200	And it's not just water.
323200	326240	Lots of atoms use hexagons because, take a note,
326240	328240	hexagons are the bestagons.
328240	329600	Oh, using a pencil?
329600	333520	Get ready to have your mind blown about the hexagon here too.
333520	334240	The lead.
334240	336240	Well, it isn't lead lead, it's carbon.
336240	338560	And you know what carbon atoms think is the bestagon?
339120	340160	The hexagon.
340160	343040	Pencil graphite is a whole bunch of hexagonal carbons,
343040	346160	and when they happen to be in a straight sheet, that's graphene,
346160	350480	which happens to be the strongest atomic material in the universe,
350480	352240	some of which is in that pencil.
352240	353840	To tear a sheet of graphene apart,
353840	357600	you would need a hundred times more force than to do so with steel.
357600	359440	Hexagon is strong-agon.
359440	361440	This is because when hexagons come together,
361440	364800	they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart.
364800	368560	This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.
368560	371360	Pull on one joint, and the other two equally pull back.
371360	374880	Push in, and the other two are the most able and stable to resist.
374880	376960	Now look anew at a tiling of hexagons,
376960	380240	and you see it is composed of nothing but these max stable joints,
380240	384000	each arranged perfectly to help the others be stronger and stabler.
384000	387360	This is another reason hexagons show up everywhere.
387360	390480	The universe blesses stability in her physics,
390480	392640	from those basalt columns to bubbles,
392640	394160	which, as soon as they can,
394160	398800	ditch their spheres to become as close to hexagonal perfection as they can.
398800	399760	That's so cool.
399760	400480	Oh right, yes.
400480	404560	So if your pencil lead contains some of the strongest material in the universe,
404560	405600	how can you write with it?
405600	406320	Okay, okay.
406320	408880	This is going to get even more exciting.
408880	411120	While hexagons are super strong this way,
411120	413040	they aren't super strong this way.
413040	417040	On a small scale, that means your pencil can break off in layers to leave a mark.
417040	421520	But on a big scale, hexagons can be flexible while keeping their strength,
421520	424640	letting us construct some totally unreal materials.
424640	427840	Print out a grid of hexagons in whatever from aluminum to cardboard,
427840	428880	make a little sandwich,
428880	431120	and pow, you've got honeycomb paneling,
431120	435840	a redonkulously tear-resistant material that's also super light and flexible.
435840	439200	It's used everywhere, but particularly in aviation.
439200	441280	Rockets need to be strong yet light,
441280	442400	same for aircraft,
442400	445840	with wings that really can't tear but also need to bend.
445840	449280	And only the magic of the honeycomb panel can do both as well.
449280	452160	Give thanks to the hexagon for blessing our flight,
452160	456800	and we still haven't yet discussed the most important application of the hexagon.
456800	457440	Games.
457440	460880	For centuries, there has been great debate over boards.
460880	462560	Squares or hexagons?
462560	464160	Spoiler, hexagons wins.
464160	467680	Square boards are the first thing an unenlightened species would think of.
467680	470080	They look sensible and are easy to implement,
470080	473760	but they are terrible, ineffective boards that cause spatial suffering.
473760	478240	On a square board, move horizontal or vertical one space and you've moved one space.
478240	482320	But move diagonal and the distance is the square root of two spaces.
482320	483040	Gross.
483040	485520	Diagonals warp the distance pieces move.
485520	488480	Square boards look even and tidy, but it's deceit.
488480	492000	They're diagonals corrupting the meaning of space and time.
492000	496480	And of course they must, because a square only has four true neighbors.
496480	500160	Hexagons, however, have six, which is more than four, which is better.
500160	504160	And the distance from one space to the next is the same in every direction.
504160	505200	One space.
505200	506480	Just as it should be.
506480	508960	If you are a game based on squares, I'm so sorry.
508960	510320	But there is hope.
510320	514400	With thought and effort, you can hexagon yourself into a better place.
514400	516320	As we all should aspire to do.
516320	518960	Spreading order and hexagonal enlightenment.
518960	521600	For hexagons are the bestagons.
521600	524240	And now that you agree, with your eyes you will see
524240	526880	there's six-sided perfection in all things.
526880	529840	And you will say to yourself as part of the order,
529840	532080	hexagons are the bestagons.
536480	539840	Uh, thanks for stopping by for communicator coffee.
542640	543120	Now go.
543680	555200	Share the enlightenment of the order with others.
