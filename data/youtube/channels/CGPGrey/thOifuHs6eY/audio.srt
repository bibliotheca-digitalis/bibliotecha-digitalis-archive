1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
You know, hexagons are the bestagons.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,760
Why? Because bees.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,240
Bees are the best and build only the bestagon, the hexagon.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,480
Now, I know what you're thinking.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,120
Bees build hexagons because they're hexapods with hexagon eyes.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,720
How could they do otherwise?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,800
Excellent point.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,760
But the Humbobumble has an engineering problem to solve.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,040
She makes two things.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,080
Honey and wax.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,000
The former to eat and the latter to contain the former.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,480
To make but a little honey, she must visit a lot of flowers.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,720
And to make one unit of wax, she needs eight units of honey.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,760
Wax is costly for bees in flower terms and honey is drippy in food terms.

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,280
So to make a hive that contains the maximum honey while using the minimum wax is royally vital.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Thus, a honeycomb conjecture.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,720
Which shape works best?

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,480
To answer, we need to talk tiles.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,360
Tiling is covering a surface with a pattern of polygons.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,160
There's lots of options because there's lots of polygons.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,440
Even the regulars go on and on again.

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,480
Now for bees picking patterns, the more complicated ones obviously use more lines than necessary.

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,160
That's what complicated means.

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,680
And thus a honeycomb of that tile would use more wax per honey.

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,240
So sticking to the simple regulars, there are just three that tile tightly.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
Triangle, square, and hexagon.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
Pentagons are broken hexagons leaving gaps, same with septagons.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,760
Octagons are alright, but they're no hexagon.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,440
Which leaves the tiling trio which tile differently.

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,160
A square is a square of squares, which is a square of squares, and so on.

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,320
Squares tile tightly by basically cheating,

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
covering an infinite plane with an infinite number of parallel lines.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,880
Like, wow, that's what a plane is.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,760
Boring!

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,520
Triangles pull the same trick, dividing themselves down into infinite nothing.

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
But not the hexagon.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,000
The only regular polygon to tile a plane without resorting to debasing self-division.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Unlike some squares I could mention.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,120
At least triangle is trying to be more geometrically interesting than square,

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,760
teaming up a bit to one, two, three, four, five, six-

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,640
Wait, hexagon!

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
The other shapes can't help it.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
They just want to be the bestagon.

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,040
Even some of the irregulars like rhombus tile by hexagoning.

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,200
Same with your trackus tiles, and deltoid trihexanoggles,

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,560
and your, uh, crystal rombles, and florid pentanoggles.

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
Look, they're all just hexagons.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,200
Even kyro tiles, poor pentagons tile up as best they can to form a lumpy hexagon.

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,920
The rest just can't compete with the best.

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
The hexagon nobly indivisible is the bestagon.

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,880
Uh, where were we?

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
Oh right, honeycomb conjecture.

53
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,400
Max honey, min wax, three options.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,120
Okay, yes, there's the circle, a shape defined by the least perimeter for the most area,

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
but that only works when you need just one.

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,680
Pack circles and this is the best they can do.

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
Look at all that wasted space.

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,920
And even if you pack the gaps, you still use more wax.

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,240
And again, the way these circles arrange themselves,

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,960
it's almost like, one, two, three, four, five, six, hidden hexagon.

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Bees use the hexagon because no shape is better to create the maximum area for the minimum wall.

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,600
And this min-max stat of hexagon is one of the many reasons they show up everywhere,

63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,240
including in the aforementioned bee's eyes.

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,400
Each hexagon is a long tube that leads to the light-catching cells at the bottom.

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
More light equals better vision,

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,240
and hexagons let the most light in using the least amount of wall.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,400
So why aren't your eyes hexagons?

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Au contraire mon ami, they are le hexagon.

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,080
Not on the outside, but on the inside.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,880
Your light-catching cells are at the back of your eye,

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,840
in a hexagonal grid for the same reason as bees.

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Max light, min wall.

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
Your window to the world is but through the hexagon.

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
Does that not make it the bestagon?

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,680
Okay, maybe hexagon as min-maxagon doesn't catch your fancy.

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,600
Then how about a little mystery, oui?

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
Let us travel to Saturn.

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,520
Yes, the rings are attention-grabbing, but leave the equator, travel north,

79
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
and here lies the unexplained.

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
The great hexagon of Saturn.

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,480
Need something for scale?

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
Well, here's the Earth.

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,080
Oh, here's six the Earths.

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
Saturn's hexagon is pretty big.

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,440
What is it?

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
Well, you might be thinking it's a geological formation,

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
an enormous basalt column like the smaller versions you find on Earth.

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,920
But no, Saturn is a gas giant.

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
There is no surface or geology to speak of,

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,160
so the great hexagon is composed of shapeless clouds

91
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,200
somehow keeping shape and changing color.

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,680
It's a magnificent solar system mystery.

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
And while I'm no space archaeologist,

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
if I was looking for an alien-gifted monolith,

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,920
on the most look-at-me planet under a hexagon beacon with Earth-sized sides,

96
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,200
that's where I would start.

97
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,760
After all, what aliens would want to make first contact with the nearby monkeys

98
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,760
before they became enlightened to pursue the universal truth?

99
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Hexagon is the bestagon.

100
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,480
From the largest down to the smallest.

101
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,280
Say, for example, this tiny snowflake I happen to have.

102
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
That has six sides as all snowflakes do.

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
Gee, what could cause that to be?

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
Let's zoom down to the atomic realm and see.

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
When water molecules join together to make a flake,

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,200
the sturdy shape they prefer is the hexagon.

107
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,400
As more molecules join, they extend the flake fractally up.

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
The beauty of the snowflake on the monkey scale

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
is but an extension of the hexagonal perfection on the atomic scale.

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
Okay, yes, you will sometimes find snowflakes with 12 sides,

111
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
but this happens when two growing snowflakes get stuck together,

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,280
so it still counts.

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
And the hexagon isn't just for snow, but for all ice 1h,

114
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,120
which means basically all ice on Earth.

115
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
Yeah, there's a little ice 1c,

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
which we don't talk about because it's made of cubes

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
and cubes are boring and there's a bit of ice 9.

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,080
No, don't touch that.

119
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
But if there is ice in your drink,

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
give thanks to the hexagon for keeping it cool.

121
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,200
And it's not just water.

122
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,240
Lots of atoms use hexagons because, take a note,

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
hexagons are the bestagons.

124
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Oh, using a pencil?

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
Get ready to have your mind blown about the hexagon here too.

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,240
The lead.

127
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Well, it isn't lead lead, it's carbon.

128
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
And you know what carbon atoms think is the bestagon?

129
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,160
The hexagon.

130
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,040
Pencil graphite is a whole bunch of hexagonal carbons,

131
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,160
and when they happen to be in a straight sheet, that's graphene,

132
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,480
which happens to be the strongest atomic material in the universe,

133
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
some of which is in that pencil.

134
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
To tear a sheet of graphene apart,

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
you would need a hundred times more force than to do so with steel.

136
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
Hexagon is strong-agon.

137
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
This is because when hexagons come together,

138
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart.

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,560
This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.

140
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Pull on one joint, and the other two equally pull back.

141
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
Push in, and the other two are the most able and stable to resist.

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
Now look anew at a tiling of hexagons,

143
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
and you see it is composed of nothing but these max stable joints,

144
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
each arranged perfectly to help the others be stronger and stabler.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,360
This is another reason hexagons show up everywhere.

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,480
The universe blesses stability in her physics,

147
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,640
from those basalt columns to bubbles,

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,160
which, as soon as they can,

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
ditch their spheres to become as close to hexagonal perfection as they can.

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
That's so cool.

151
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,480
Oh right, yes.

152
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,560
So if your pencil lead contains some of the strongest material in the universe,

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
how can you write with it?

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,320
Okay, okay.

155
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,880
This is going to get even more exciting.

156
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
While hexagons are super strong this way,

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,040
they aren't super strong this way.

158
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
On a small scale, that means your pencil can break off in layers to leave a mark.

159
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,520
But on a big scale, hexagons can be flexible while keeping their strength,

160
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,640
letting us construct some totally unreal materials.

161
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,840
Print out a grid of hexagons in whatever from aluminum to cardboard,

162
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,880
make a little sandwich,

163
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
and pow, you've got honeycomb paneling,

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840
a redonkulously tear-resistant material that's also super light and flexible.

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,200
It's used everywhere, but particularly in aviation.

166
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,280
Rockets need to be strong yet light,

167
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
same for aircraft,

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,840
with wings that really can't tear but also need to bend.

169
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,280
And only the magic of the honeycomb panel can do both as well.

170
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
Give thanks to the hexagon for blessing our flight,

171
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
and we still haven't yet discussed the most important application of the hexagon.

172
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,440
Games.

173
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
For centuries, there has been great debate over boards.

174
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
Squares or hexagons?

175
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Spoiler, hexagons wins.

176
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
Square boards are the first thing an unenlightened species would think of.

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
They look sensible and are easy to implement,

178
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,760
but they are terrible, ineffective boards that cause spatial suffering.

179
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,240
On a square board, move horizontal or vertical one space and you've moved one space.

180
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,320
But move diagonal and the distance is the square root of two spaces.

181
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,040
Gross.

182
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,520
Diagonals warp the distance pieces move.

183
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Square boards look even and tidy, but it's deceit.

184
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,000
They're diagonals corrupting the meaning of space and time.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,480
And of course they must, because a square only has four true neighbors.

186
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,160
Hexagons, however, have six, which is more than four, which is better.

187
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
And the distance from one space to the next is the same in every direction.

188
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
One space.

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
Just as it should be.

190
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,960
If you are a game based on squares, I'm so sorry.

191
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,320
But there is hope.

192
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,400
With thought and effort, you can hexagon yourself into a better place.

193
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
As we all should aspire to do.

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,960
Spreading order and hexagonal enlightenment.

195
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,600
For hexagons are the bestagons.

196
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,240
And now that you agree, with your eyes you will see

197
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
there's six-sided perfection in all things.

198
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,840
And you will say to yourself as part of the order,

199
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,080
hexagons are the bestagons.

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,840
Uh, thanks for stopping by for communicator coffee.

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,120
Now go.

202
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:15,200
Share the enlightenment of the order with others.
