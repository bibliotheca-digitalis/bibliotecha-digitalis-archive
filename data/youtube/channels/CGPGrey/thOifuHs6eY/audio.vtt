00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
You know, hexagons are the bestagons.

00:03.760 --> 00:05.760
Why? Because bees.

00:05.760 --> 00:09.240
Bees are the best and build only the bestagon, the hexagon.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.480
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.120
Bees build hexagons because they're hexapods with hexagon eyes.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.720
How could they do otherwise?

00:15.720 --> 00:16.800
Excellent point.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.760
But the Humbobumble has an engineering problem to solve.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.040
She makes two things.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.080
Honey and wax.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.000
The former to eat and the latter to contain the former.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.480
To make but a little honey, she must visit a lot of flowers.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.720
And to make one unit of wax, she needs eight units of honey.

00:31.720 --> 00:35.760
Wax is costly for bees in flower terms and honey is drippy in food terms.

00:35.760 --> 00:41.280
So to make a hive that contains the maximum honey while using the minimum wax is royally vital.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.120
Thus, a honeycomb conjecture.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.720
Which shape works best?

00:44.720 --> 00:46.480
To answer, we need to talk tiles.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.360
Tiling is covering a surface with a pattern of polygons.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.160
There's lots of options because there's lots of polygons.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.440
Even the regulars go on and on again.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.480
Now for bees picking patterns, the more complicated ones obviously use more lines than necessary.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.160
That's what complicated means.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.680
And thus a honeycomb of that tile would use more wax per honey.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.240
So sticking to the simple regulars, there are just three that tile tightly.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.840
Triangle, square, and hexagon.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.360
Pentagons are broken hexagons leaving gaps, same with septagons.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.760
Octagons are alright, but they're no hexagon.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.440
Which leaves the tiling trio which tile differently.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.160
A square is a square of squares, which is a square of squares, and so on.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.320
Squares tile tightly by basically cheating,

01:24.320 --> 01:27.920
covering an infinite plane with an infinite number of parallel lines.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.880
Like, wow, that's what a plane is.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.760
Boring!

01:31.760 --> 01:35.520
Triangles pull the same trick, dividing themselves down into infinite nothing.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.960
But not the hexagon.

01:36.960 --> 01:42.000
The only regular polygon to tile a plane without resorting to debasing self-division.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.680
Unlike some squares I could mention.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.120
At least triangle is trying to be more geometrically interesting than square,

01:47.120 --> 01:49.760
teaming up a bit to one, two, three, four, five, six-

01:49.760 --> 01:50.640
Wait, hexagon!

01:50.640 --> 01:52.000
The other shapes can't help it.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.080
They just want to be the bestagon.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.040
Even some of the irregulars like rhombus tile by hexagoning.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.200
Same with your trackus tiles, and deltoid trihexanoggles,

02:01.200 --> 02:06.560
and your, uh, crystal rombles, and florid pentanoggles.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.920
Look, they're all just hexagons.

02:07.920 --> 02:13.200
Even kyro tiles, poor pentagons tile up as best they can to form a lumpy hexagon.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.920
The rest just can't compete with the best.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.760
The hexagon nobly indivisible is the bestagon.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.880
Uh, where were we?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.240
Oh right, honeycomb conjecture.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.400
Max honey, min wax, three options.

02:24.400 --> 02:29.120
Okay, yes, there's the circle, a shape defined by the least perimeter for the most area,

02:29.120 --> 02:31.120
but that only works when you need just one.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.680
Pack circles and this is the best they can do.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.040
Look at all that wasted space.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.920
And even if you pack the gaps, you still use more wax.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.240
And again, the way these circles arrange themselves,

02:40.240 --> 02:42.960
it's almost like, one, two, three, four, five, six, hidden hexagon.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.560
Bees use the hexagon because no shape is better to create the maximum area for the minimum wall.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.600
And this min-max stat of hexagon is one of the many reasons they show up everywhere,

02:53.600 --> 02:56.240
including in the aforementioned bee's eyes.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.400
Each hexagon is a long tube that leads to the light-catching cells at the bottom.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.000
More light equals better vision,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.240
and hexagons let the most light in using the least amount of wall.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.400
So why aren't your eyes hexagons?

03:08.400 --> 03:11.200
Au contraire mon ami, they are le hexagon.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.080
Not on the outside, but on the inside.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.880
Your light-catching cells are at the back of your eye,

03:16.880 --> 03:19.840
in a hexagonal grid for the same reason as bees.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.360
Max light, min wall.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.560
Your window to the world is but through the hexagon.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.640
Does that not make it the bestagon?

03:26.640 --> 03:29.680
Okay, maybe hexagon as min-maxagon doesn't catch your fancy.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.600
Then how about a little mystery, oui?

03:31.600 --> 03:33.440
Let us travel to Saturn.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.520
Yes, the rings are attention-grabbing, but leave the equator, travel north,

03:37.520 --> 03:39.440
and here lies the unexplained.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.360
The great hexagon of Saturn.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.480
Need something for scale?

03:42.480 --> 03:43.840
Well, here's the Earth.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.080
Oh, here's six the Earths.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.720
Saturn's hexagon is pretty big.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.440
What is it?

03:49.440 --> 03:52.080
Well, you might be thinking it's a geological formation,

03:52.080 --> 03:56.080
an enormous basalt column like the smaller versions you find on Earth.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.920
But no, Saturn is a gas giant.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.640
There is no surface or geology to speak of,

04:00.640 --> 04:04.160
so the great hexagon is composed of shapeless clouds

04:04.160 --> 04:07.200
somehow keeping shape and changing color.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.680
It's a magnificent solar system mystery.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.760
And while I'm no space archaeologist,

04:11.760 --> 04:14.720
if I was looking for an alien-gifted monolith,

04:14.720 --> 04:19.920
on the most look-at-me planet under a hexagon beacon with Earth-sized sides,

04:19.920 --> 04:21.200
that's where I would start.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.760
After all, what aliens would want to make first contact with the nearby monkeys

04:25.760 --> 04:29.760
before they became enlightened to pursue the universal truth?

04:29.760 --> 04:31.760
Hexagon is the bestagon.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.480
From the largest down to the smallest.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.280
Say, for example, this tiny snowflake I happen to have.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.080
That has six sides as all snowflakes do.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.600
Gee, what could cause that to be?

04:41.600 --> 04:44.160
Let's zoom down to the atomic realm and see.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.560
When water molecules join together to make a flake,

04:46.560 --> 04:49.200
the sturdy shape they prefer is the hexagon.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.400
As more molecules join, they extend the flake fractally up.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.720
The beauty of the snowflake on the monkey scale

04:54.720 --> 04:58.720
is but an extension of the hexagonal perfection on the atomic scale.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.840
Okay, yes, you will sometimes find snowflakes with 12 sides,

05:01.840 --> 05:04.400
but this happens when two growing snowflakes get stuck together,

05:04.400 --> 05:05.280
so it still counts.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.880
And the hexagon isn't just for snow, but for all ice 1h,

05:08.880 --> 05:11.120
which means basically all ice on Earth.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.560
Yeah, there's a little ice 1c,

05:12.560 --> 05:14.720
which we don't talk about because it's made of cubes

05:14.720 --> 05:17.360
and cubes are boring and there's a bit of ice 9.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.080
No, don't touch that.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.520
But if there is ice in your drink,

05:19.520 --> 05:22.080
give thanks to the hexagon for keeping it cool.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.200
And it's not just water.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.240
Lots of atoms use hexagons because, take a note,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.240
hexagons are the bestagons.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.600
Oh, using a pencil?

05:29.600 --> 05:33.520
Get ready to have your mind blown about the hexagon here too.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.240
The lead.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.240
Well, it isn't lead lead, it's carbon.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.560
And you know what carbon atoms think is the bestagon?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.160
The hexagon.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.040
Pencil graphite is a whole bunch of hexagonal carbons,

05:43.040 --> 05:46.160
and when they happen to be in a straight sheet, that's graphene,

05:46.160 --> 05:50.480
which happens to be the strongest atomic material in the universe,

05:50.480 --> 05:52.240
some of which is in that pencil.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.840
To tear a sheet of graphene apart,

05:53.840 --> 05:57.600
you would need a hundred times more force than to do so with steel.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.440
Hexagon is strong-agon.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
This is because when hexagons come together,

06:01.440 --> 06:04.800
they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.560
This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.360
Pull on one joint, and the other two equally pull back.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.880
Push in, and the other two are the most able and stable to resist.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.960
Now look anew at a tiling of hexagons,

06:16.960 --> 06:20.240
and you see it is composed of nothing but these max stable joints,

06:20.240 --> 06:24.000
each arranged perfectly to help the others be stronger and stabler.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.360
This is another reason hexagons show up everywhere.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.480
The universe blesses stability in her physics,

06:30.480 --> 06:32.640
from those basalt columns to bubbles,

06:32.640 --> 06:34.160
which, as soon as they can,

06:34.160 --> 06:38.800
ditch their spheres to become as close to hexagonal perfection as they can.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.760
That's so cool.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.480
Oh right, yes.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.560
So if your pencil lead contains some of the strongest material in the universe,

06:44.560 --> 06:45.600
how can you write with it?

06:45.600 --> 06:46.320
Okay, okay.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.880
This is going to get even more exciting.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.120
While hexagons are super strong this way,

06:51.120 --> 06:53.040
they aren't super strong this way.

06:53.040 --> 06:57.040
On a small scale, that means your pencil can break off in layers to leave a mark.

06:57.040 --> 07:01.520
But on a big scale, hexagons can be flexible while keeping their strength,

07:01.520 --> 07:04.640
letting us construct some totally unreal materials.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.840
Print out a grid of hexagons in whatever from aluminum to cardboard,

07:07.840 --> 07:08.880
make a little sandwich,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.120
and pow, you've got honeycomb paneling,

07:11.120 --> 07:15.840
a redonkulously tear-resistant material that's also super light and flexible.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.200
It's used everywhere, but particularly in aviation.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.280
Rockets need to be strong yet light,

07:21.280 --> 07:22.400
same for aircraft,

07:22.400 --> 07:25.840
with wings that really can't tear but also need to bend.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.280
And only the magic of the honeycomb panel can do both as well.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.160
Give thanks to the hexagon for blessing our flight,

07:32.160 --> 07:36.800
and we still haven't yet discussed the most important application of the hexagon.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.440
Games.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.880
For centuries, there has been great debate over boards.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.560
Squares or hexagons?

07:42.560 --> 07:44.160
Spoiler, hexagons wins.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.680
Square boards are the first thing an unenlightened species would think of.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.080
They look sensible and are easy to implement,

07:50.080 --> 07:53.760
but they are terrible, ineffective boards that cause spatial suffering.

07:53.760 --> 07:58.240
On a square board, move horizontal or vertical one space and you've moved one space.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.320
But move diagonal and the distance is the square root of two spaces.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.040
Gross.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.520
Diagonals warp the distance pieces move.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.480
Square boards look even and tidy, but it's deceit.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.000
They're diagonals corrupting the meaning of space and time.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.480
And of course they must, because a square only has four true neighbors.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.160
Hexagons, however, have six, which is more than four, which is better.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.160
And the distance from one space to the next is the same in every direction.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.200
One space.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.480
Just as it should be.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.960
If you are a game based on squares, I'm so sorry.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.320
But there is hope.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.400
With thought and effort, you can hexagon yourself into a better place.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.320
As we all should aspire to do.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.960
Spreading order and hexagonal enlightenment.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.600
For hexagons are the bestagons.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.240
And now that you agree, with your eyes you will see

08:44.240 --> 08:46.880
there's six-sided perfection in all things.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.840
And you will say to yourself as part of the order,

08:49.840 --> 08:52.080
hexagons are the bestagons.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.840
Uh, thanks for stopping by for communicator coffee.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.120
Now go.

09:03.680 --> 09:15.200
Share the enlightenment of the order with others.
