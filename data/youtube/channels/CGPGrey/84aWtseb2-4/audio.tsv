0	3580	Every year, some countries move their clocks forward in the spring, only to move them back
3580	4580	in the autumn.
4580	8280	To the vast majority of the world who doesn't participate in this odd clock fiddling, it
8280	10120	seems a baffling thing to do.
10120	11880	So what's the reason behind it?
11880	16320	The original idea, proposed by George Hudson, was to give people more sunlight in the summer.
16320	19840	Of course, it's important to note that changing a clock doesn't actually make more sunlight
19840	21760	â€” that's not how physics works.
21760	25520	But by moving the clocks forward an hour, compared to all other human activity, the
25520	28060	sun will seem to both rise and set later.
28060	31060	The time when the clocks are moved forward is called daylight saving time, and the rest
31060	33360	of the year is called standard time.
33360	36820	This switch effectively gives people more time to enjoy the sunshine and nice summer
36820	38140	weather after work.
38140	41940	Hudson, in particular, wanted more sunlight so he could spend more time adding to his
41940	43580	insect collection.
43580	46700	When winter is coming, the clocks move back, presumably because people don't want to
46700	48260	go outside anymore.
48260	50540	But winter doesn't have this effect on everyone.
50540	53860	If you live in a tropical place like Hawaii, you really don't have to worry about seasons
53860	56140	because they pretty much don't happen.
56140	59900	Every day, all year, is sunny and beautiful, so Christmas is just as good of a day to hit
59900	61380	the beach as any other.
61380	65700	And so, Hawaii is one of two states in the union that ignore daylight saving time.
65700	68840	But the further you travel from the equator in either direction, the more the seasons
68840	73060	assert themselves and you get colder and darker winters, making summertime much more valuable
73060	74060	to the locals.
74060	77540	So it's no surprise that the further a country is from the equator, the more likely it uses
77540	79140	daylight saving time.
79140	83020	Hudson proposed this idea in Wellington in 1895, but it wasn't well received and it
83020	87300	took until 1916 for Germany to be the first country to put it into practice.
87300	90820	Though the uber-industrious Germans were less concerned with catching butterflies on a fine
90820	94480	summer evening than they were with saving coal to feed the war machine.
94480	97020	The Germans thought daylight saving time would conserve energy.
97020	100460	The reasoning goes that it encourages people to stay out later in the summer and thus use
100460	102060	less artificial lighting.
102060	105560	This sounds logical and it may have worked in the more regimented society of a hundred
105560	108460	years ago, but does it still work in the modern world?
108460	111540	That turns out to be a surprisingly difficult question to answer.
111540	114900	For example, take mankind's greatest invention, air conditioning.
114900	118600	The magic box of cool that makes otherwise uninhabitable sections of the world quite
118600	120380	tolerable places to live.
120380	123980	But pumping heat out of your house isn't cheap and turning on one air conditioner is the
123980	126440	same as running dozens of tungsten light bulbs.
126440	129960	If people get more sunshine, but they don't use it to go outside, then daylight saving
129960	132620	time might actually cost electricity, not save it.
132620	135740	This is particularly true in a place like Phoenix, where the average summer high is
135740	139160	107 degrees and the record is 122.
139160	142960	If you suggest to an Arizonan to change their clocks in the summer to get more sunshine,
142960	144440	they laugh in your face.
144440	148180	Sun and higher electricity bills are not what they want, which is why Arizona is the second
148180	150360	state that never changes their clocks.
150360	153820	Another problem with trying to study daylight saving time is rapid changes in technology
153820	155280	and electrical use.
155280	159080	As technology gets better and better and better, more electricity is dedicated to things that
159080	163240	aren't light bulbs and the lore of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled day outside is less
163240	166960	appealing than technological entertainment and climate-controlled comfort inside.
166960	171120	Also, the horrifically energy-inefficient tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged
171120	175880	for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs, greatly reducing the amount of energy required
175880	177080	to light a room.
177080	180640	So even assuming that daylight saving time is effective, it's probably less effective
180640	182080	with every passing year.
182080	185440	The bottom line is while some studies say daylight saving time costs more electricity
185440	189840	and others say it saves electricity, the one thing they agree on is the effect size.
189840	195440	Not 20% or 10%, but 1% or less, which, in the United States, works out to be about $4
195440	196440	per household.
196440	200760	$4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire year is not really a huge deal either
200760	204920	way, so the question now becomes is the hassle of switching clocks twice a year worth it?
204920	208800	The most obvious trouble comes from sleep deprivation, an already too common affliction
208800	212120	in the Western world that daylight saving time makes measurably worse.
212120	215280	With time tracking software, we can actually see that people are less productive the week
215280	216760	after the clock changes.
216760	219460	This comes with huge associated costs.
219460	223160	To make things worse, most countries take away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning.
223160	226360	Sleep deprivation can lead to heart attacks and suicides, and the daylight saving time
226360	229320	Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.
229320	232200	Other troubles come from scheduling meetings across time zones.
232200	235560	Let's say you're trying to plan a three-way conference between New York, London, and Sydney.
235560	238720	Not an easy thing to do under the best of circumstances, but made extra difficult when
238720	241800	they don't agree on when daylight saving time should start and end.
241800	245760	In the spring, Sydney is 11 hours ahead of London and New York is 5 hours behind.
245760	249080	But then New York is the first to enter daylight saving time and moves its clock forward an
249080	250080	hour.
250080	252080	Two weeks later, London does the same.
252080	255600	In one more week, Sydney, being on the opposite side of the world, leaves daylight saving
255600	257880	time and moves its clock back an hour.
257880	261640	So in the space of three weeks, New York is 5 hours behind London, then 4 hours, then
261640	262640	5 again.
262640	267960	And Sydney is either 11, 10, or 9 hours from London, and 16, 15, or 14 hours from New York.
267960	271640	And this whole crazy thing happens again in reverse six months later.
271640	274920	Back in the Dark Ages, this might not have mattered so much, but in the modern interconnected
274920	278520	world, planning international meetings happens thousands and thousands of times daily.
278520	281840	Shifting in inconsistent time zones isn't doing netizens any favors.
281880	285800	And, countries aren't even consistent about daylight saving time within their own borders.
285800	288800	Brazil has daylight saving time, but only if you live in the south.
288800	291060	Canada has it too, but not Saskatchewan.
291060	294520	Most of Oz does daylight saving time, but not Western Australia, the Northern Territory,
294520	295520	or Queensland.
295520	299080	And, of course, the United States does have daylight saving time, unless you live in Puerto
299080	302920	Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or, as
302920	305380	mentioned before, Hawaii and Arizona.
305380	307680	But Arizona isn't even consistent within itself.
307680	311560	While Arizona ignores daylight saving time, the Navajo Nation inside of Arizona follows
311560	312560	it.
312560	316520	Inside of the Navajo Nation is the Hopi Reservation, which, like Arizona, ignores daylight saving
316520	317520	time.
317520	321480	Going deeper, inside of the Hopi Reservation is another part of the Navajo Nation, which
321480	323620	does follow daylight saving time.
323620	327720	And finally, there's also a part of the Hopi Reservation elsewhere in the Navajo Nation,
327720	328720	which doesn't.
328720	333400	So, driving across this 100-mile stretch would technically necessitate seven clock changes,
333400	334960	which is insane.
334960	338580	While this is an unusual local oddity, here's a map showing the different daylight saving
338580	341120	and time zone rules in all their complicated glory.
341120	344920	It's a huge mess and constantly needs updating as countries change their laws.
344920	348200	Which is why it shouldn't be surprising that even our digital gadgets can't keep the time
348200	349840	straight occasionally.
349840	353880	So to review, daylight saving time gives more sunlight in the summer after work, which,
353880	356820	depending on where you live, might be an advantage, or not.
356820	359220	And it may, or may not, save electricity.
359220	362440	But one thing is sure, it's guaranteed to make something that should be simple, keeping
362440	364480	track of time, quite complicated.
364480	367740	Which is why, when it comes time to change the clocks, there's always a debate about
367740	368920	whether or not we should.
