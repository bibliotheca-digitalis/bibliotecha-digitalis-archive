00:00.000 --> 00:03.580
Every year, some countries move their clocks forward in the spring, only to move them back

00:03.580 --> 00:04.580
in the autumn.

00:04.580 --> 00:08.280
To the vast majority of the world who doesn't participate in this odd clock fiddling, it

00:08.280 --> 00:10.120
seems a baffling thing to do.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.880
So what's the reason behind it?

00:11.880 --> 00:16.320
The original idea, proposed by George Hudson, was to give people more sunlight in the summer.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.840
Of course, it's important to note that changing a clock doesn't actually make more sunlight

00:19.840 --> 00:21.760
â€” that's not how physics works.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.520
But by moving the clocks forward an hour, compared to all other human activity, the

00:25.520 --> 00:28.060
sun will seem to both rise and set later.

00:28.060 --> 00:31.060
The time when the clocks are moved forward is called daylight saving time, and the rest

00:31.060 --> 00:33.360
of the year is called standard time.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.820
This switch effectively gives people more time to enjoy the sunshine and nice summer

00:36.820 --> 00:38.140
weather after work.

00:38.140 --> 00:41.940
Hudson, in particular, wanted more sunlight so he could spend more time adding to his

00:41.940 --> 00:43.580
insect collection.

00:43.580 --> 00:46.700
When winter is coming, the clocks move back, presumably because people don't want to

00:46.700 --> 00:48.260
go outside anymore.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.540
But winter doesn't have this effect on everyone.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.860
If you live in a tropical place like Hawaii, you really don't have to worry about seasons

00:53.860 --> 00:56.140
because they pretty much don't happen.

00:56.140 --> 00:59.900
Every day, all year, is sunny and beautiful, so Christmas is just as good of a day to hit

00:59.900 --> 01:01.380
the beach as any other.

01:01.380 --> 01:05.700
And so, Hawaii is one of two states in the union that ignore daylight saving time.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.840
But the further you travel from the equator in either direction, the more the seasons

01:08.840 --> 01:13.060
assert themselves and you get colder and darker winters, making summertime much more valuable

01:13.060 --> 01:14.060
to the locals.

01:14.060 --> 01:17.540
So it's no surprise that the further a country is from the equator, the more likely it uses

01:17.540 --> 01:19.140
daylight saving time.

01:19.140 --> 01:23.020
Hudson proposed this idea in Wellington in 1895, but it wasn't well received and it

01:23.020 --> 01:27.300
took until 1916 for Germany to be the first country to put it into practice.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.820
Though the uber-industrious Germans were less concerned with catching butterflies on a fine

01:30.820 --> 01:34.480
summer evening than they were with saving coal to feed the war machine.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.020
The Germans thought daylight saving time would conserve energy.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.460
The reasoning goes that it encourages people to stay out later in the summer and thus use

01:40.460 --> 01:42.060
less artificial lighting.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.560
This sounds logical and it may have worked in the more regimented society of a hundred

01:45.560 --> 01:48.460
years ago, but does it still work in the modern world?

01:48.460 --> 01:51.540
That turns out to be a surprisingly difficult question to answer.

01:51.540 --> 01:54.900
For example, take mankind's greatest invention, air conditioning.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.600
The magic box of cool that makes otherwise uninhabitable sections of the world quite

01:58.600 --> 02:00.380
tolerable places to live.

02:00.380 --> 02:03.980
But pumping heat out of your house isn't cheap and turning on one air conditioner is the

02:03.980 --> 02:06.440
same as running dozens of tungsten light bulbs.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.960
If people get more sunshine, but they don't use it to go outside, then daylight saving

02:09.960 --> 02:12.620
time might actually cost electricity, not save it.

02:12.620 --> 02:15.740
This is particularly true in a place like Phoenix, where the average summer high is

02:15.740 --> 02:19.160
107 degrees and the record is 122.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.960
If you suggest to an Arizonan to change their clocks in the summer to get more sunshine,

02:22.960 --> 02:24.440
they laugh in your face.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.180
Sun and higher electricity bills are not what they want, which is why Arizona is the second

02:28.180 --> 02:30.360
state that never changes their clocks.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.820
Another problem with trying to study daylight saving time is rapid changes in technology

02:33.820 --> 02:35.280
and electrical use.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.080
As technology gets better and better and better, more electricity is dedicated to things that

02:39.080 --> 02:43.240
aren't light bulbs and the lore of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled day outside is less

02:43.240 --> 02:46.960
appealing than technological entertainment and climate-controlled comfort inside.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.120
Also, the horrifically energy-inefficient tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged

02:51.120 --> 02:55.880
for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs, greatly reducing the amount of energy required

02:55.880 --> 02:57.080
to light a room.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.640
So even assuming that daylight saving time is effective, it's probably less effective

03:00.640 --> 03:02.080
with every passing year.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.440
The bottom line is while some studies say daylight saving time costs more electricity

03:05.440 --> 03:09.840
and others say it saves electricity, the one thing they agree on is the effect size.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.440
Not 20% or 10%, but 1% or less, which, in the United States, works out to be about $4

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
per household.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.760
$4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire year is not really a huge deal either

03:20.760 --> 03:24.920
way, so the question now becomes is the hassle of switching clocks twice a year worth it?

03:24.920 --> 03:28.800
The most obvious trouble comes from sleep deprivation, an already too common affliction

03:28.800 --> 03:32.120
in the Western world that daylight saving time makes measurably worse.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.280
With time tracking software, we can actually see that people are less productive the week

03:35.280 --> 03:36.760
after the clock changes.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.460
This comes with huge associated costs.

03:39.460 --> 03:43.160
To make things worse, most countries take away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.360
Sleep deprivation can lead to heart attacks and suicides, and the daylight saving time

03:46.360 --> 03:49.320
Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.200
Other troubles come from scheduling meetings across time zones.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.560
Let's say you're trying to plan a three-way conference between New York, London, and Sydney.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.720
Not an easy thing to do under the best of circumstances, but made extra difficult when

03:58.720 --> 04:01.800
they don't agree on when daylight saving time should start and end.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.760
In the spring, Sydney is 11 hours ahead of London and New York is 5 hours behind.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.080
But then New York is the first to enter daylight saving time and moves its clock forward an

04:09.080 --> 04:10.080
hour.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.080
Two weeks later, London does the same.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.600
In one more week, Sydney, being on the opposite side of the world, leaves daylight saving

04:15.600 --> 04:17.880
time and moves its clock back an hour.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.640
So in the space of three weeks, New York is 5 hours behind London, then 4 hours, then

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
5 again.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.960
And Sydney is either 11, 10, or 9 hours from London, and 16, 15, or 14 hours from New York.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.640
And this whole crazy thing happens again in reverse six months later.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.920
Back in the Dark Ages, this might not have mattered so much, but in the modern interconnected

04:34.920 --> 04:38.520
world, planning international meetings happens thousands and thousands of times daily.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.840
Shifting in inconsistent time zones isn't doing netizens any favors.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.800
And, countries aren't even consistent about daylight saving time within their own borders.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.800
Brazil has daylight saving time, but only if you live in the south.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.060
Canada has it too, but not Saskatchewan.

04:51.060 --> 04:54.520
Most of Oz does daylight saving time, but not Western Australia, the Northern Territory,

04:54.520 --> 04:55.520
or Queensland.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.080
And, of course, the United States does have daylight saving time, unless you live in Puerto

04:59.080 --> 05:02.920
Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or, as

05:02.920 --> 05:05.380
mentioned before, Hawaii and Arizona.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.680
But Arizona isn't even consistent within itself.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.560
While Arizona ignores daylight saving time, the Navajo Nation inside of Arizona follows

05:11.560 --> 05:12.560
it.

05:12.560 --> 05:16.520
Inside of the Navajo Nation is the Hopi Reservation, which, like Arizona, ignores daylight saving

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
time.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.480
Going deeper, inside of the Hopi Reservation is another part of the Navajo Nation, which

05:21.480 --> 05:23.620
does follow daylight saving time.

05:23.620 --> 05:27.720
And finally, there's also a part of the Hopi Reservation elsewhere in the Navajo Nation,

05:27.720 --> 05:28.720
which doesn't.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.400
So, driving across this 100-mile stretch would technically necessitate seven clock changes,

05:33.400 --> 05:34.960
which is insane.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.580
While this is an unusual local oddity, here's a map showing the different daylight saving

05:38.580 --> 05:41.120
and time zone rules in all their complicated glory.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.920
It's a huge mess and constantly needs updating as countries change their laws.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.200
Which is why it shouldn't be surprising that even our digital gadgets can't keep the time

05:48.200 --> 05:49.840
straight occasionally.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.880
So to review, daylight saving time gives more sunlight in the summer after work, which,

05:53.880 --> 05:56.820
depending on where you live, might be an advantage, or not.

05:56.820 --> 05:59.220
And it may, or may not, save electricity.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.440
But one thing is sure, it's guaranteed to make something that should be simple, keeping

06:02.440 --> 06:04.480
track of time, quite complicated.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.740
Which is why, when it comes time to change the clocks, there's always a debate about

06:07.740 --> 06:08.920
whether or not we should.
