1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Every year, some countries move their clocks forward in the spring, only to move them back

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,580
in the autumn.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,280
To the vast majority of the world who doesn't participate in this odd clock fiddling, it

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,120
seems a baffling thing to do.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,880
So what's the reason behind it?

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,320
The original idea, proposed by George Hudson, was to give people more sunlight in the summer.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
Of course, it's important to note that changing a clock doesn't actually make more sunlight

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
â€” that's not how physics works.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,520
But by moving the clocks forward an hour, compared to all other human activity, the

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,060
sun will seem to both rise and set later.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,060
The time when the clocks are moved forward is called daylight saving time, and the rest

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,360
of the year is called standard time.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,820
This switch effectively gives people more time to enjoy the sunshine and nice summer

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,140
weather after work.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,940
Hudson, in particular, wanted more sunlight so he could spend more time adding to his

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,580
insect collection.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,700
When winter is coming, the clocks move back, presumably because people don't want to

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,260
go outside anymore.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,540
But winter doesn't have this effect on everyone.

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,860
If you live in a tropical place like Hawaii, you really don't have to worry about seasons

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,140
because they pretty much don't happen.

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,900
Every day, all year, is sunny and beautiful, so Christmas is just as good of a day to hit

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,380
the beach as any other.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,700
And so, Hawaii is one of two states in the union that ignore daylight saving time.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,840
But the further you travel from the equator in either direction, the more the seasons

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,060
assert themselves and you get colder and darker winters, making summertime much more valuable

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,060
to the locals.

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,540
So it's no surprise that the further a country is from the equator, the more likely it uses

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,140
daylight saving time.

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,020
Hudson proposed this idea in Wellington in 1895, but it wasn't well received and it

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,300
took until 1916 for Germany to be the first country to put it into practice.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,820
Though the uber-industrious Germans were less concerned with catching butterflies on a fine

33
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,480
summer evening than they were with saving coal to feed the war machine.

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,020
The Germans thought daylight saving time would conserve energy.

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,460
The reasoning goes that it encourages people to stay out later in the summer and thus use

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,060
less artificial lighting.

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,560
This sounds logical and it may have worked in the more regimented society of a hundred

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,460
years ago, but does it still work in the modern world?

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,540
That turns out to be a surprisingly difficult question to answer.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,900
For example, take mankind's greatest invention, air conditioning.

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,600
The magic box of cool that makes otherwise uninhabitable sections of the world quite

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,380
tolerable places to live.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,980
But pumping heat out of your house isn't cheap and turning on one air conditioner is the

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,440
same as running dozens of tungsten light bulbs.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,960
If people get more sunshine, but they don't use it to go outside, then daylight saving

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,620
time might actually cost electricity, not save it.

47
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,740
This is particularly true in a place like Phoenix, where the average summer high is

48
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,160
107 degrees and the record is 122.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,960
If you suggest to an Arizonan to change their clocks in the summer to get more sunshine,

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,440
they laugh in your face.

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,180
Sun and higher electricity bills are not what they want, which is why Arizona is the second

52
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,360
state that never changes their clocks.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,820
Another problem with trying to study daylight saving time is rapid changes in technology

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,280
and electrical use.

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,080
As technology gets better and better and better, more electricity is dedicated to things that

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,240
aren't light bulbs and the lore of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled day outside is less

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,960
appealing than technological entertainment and climate-controlled comfort inside.

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,120
Also, the horrifically energy-inefficient tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,880
for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs, greatly reducing the amount of energy required

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
to light a room.

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,640
So even assuming that daylight saving time is effective, it's probably less effective

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
with every passing year.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
The bottom line is while some studies say daylight saving time costs more electricity

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,840
and others say it saves electricity, the one thing they agree on is the effect size.

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,440
Not 20% or 10%, but 1% or less, which, in the United States, works out to be about $4

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
per household.

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,760
$4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire year is not really a huge deal either

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,920
way, so the question now becomes is the hassle of switching clocks twice a year worth it?

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,800
The most obvious trouble comes from sleep deprivation, an already too common affliction

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,120
in the Western world that daylight saving time makes measurably worse.

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,280
With time tracking software, we can actually see that people are less productive the week

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,760
after the clock changes.

73
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,460
This comes with huge associated costs.

74
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,160
To make things worse, most countries take away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning.

75
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,360
Sleep deprivation can lead to heart attacks and suicides, and the daylight saving time

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,320
Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.

77
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,200
Other troubles come from scheduling meetings across time zones.

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,560
Let's say you're trying to plan a three-way conference between New York, London, and Sydney.

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,720
Not an easy thing to do under the best of circumstances, but made extra difficult when

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,800
they don't agree on when daylight saving time should start and end.

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,760
In the spring, Sydney is 11 hours ahead of London and New York is 5 hours behind.

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,080
But then New York is the first to enter daylight saving time and moves its clock forward an

83
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
hour.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Two weeks later, London does the same.

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,600
In one more week, Sydney, being on the opposite side of the world, leaves daylight saving

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,880
time and moves its clock back an hour.

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,640
So in the space of three weeks, New York is 5 hours behind London, then 4 hours, then

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
5 again.

89
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,960
And Sydney is either 11, 10, or 9 hours from London, and 16, 15, or 14 hours from New York.

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,640
And this whole crazy thing happens again in reverse six months later.

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,920
Back in the Dark Ages, this might not have mattered so much, but in the modern interconnected

92
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,520
world, planning international meetings happens thousands and thousands of times daily.

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,840
Shifting in inconsistent time zones isn't doing netizens any favors.

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,800
And, countries aren't even consistent about daylight saving time within their own borders.

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Brazil has daylight saving time, but only if you live in the south.

96
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,060
Canada has it too, but not Saskatchewan.

97
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,520
Most of Oz does daylight saving time, but not Western Australia, the Northern Territory,

98
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
or Queensland.

99
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,080
And, of course, the United States does have daylight saving time, unless you live in Puerto

100
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or, as

101
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,380
mentioned before, Hawaii and Arizona.

102
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,680
But Arizona isn't even consistent within itself.

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,560
While Arizona ignores daylight saving time, the Navajo Nation inside of Arizona follows

104
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
it.

105
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,520
Inside of the Navajo Nation is the Hopi Reservation, which, like Arizona, ignores daylight saving

106
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
time.

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Going deeper, inside of the Hopi Reservation is another part of the Navajo Nation, which

108
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,620
does follow daylight saving time.

109
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,720
And finally, there's also a part of the Hopi Reservation elsewhere in the Navajo Nation,

110
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
which doesn't.

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,400
So, driving across this 100-mile stretch would technically necessitate seven clock changes,

112
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,960
which is insane.

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,580
While this is an unusual local oddity, here's a map showing the different daylight saving

114
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,120
and time zone rules in all their complicated glory.

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,920
It's a huge mess and constantly needs updating as countries change their laws.

116
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,200
Which is why it shouldn't be surprising that even our digital gadgets can't keep the time

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,840
straight occasionally.

118
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,880
So to review, daylight saving time gives more sunlight in the summer after work, which,

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,820
depending on where you live, might be an advantage, or not.

120
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,220
And it may, or may not, save electricity.

121
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,440
But one thing is sure, it's guaranteed to make something that should be simple, keeping

122
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,480
track of time, quite complicated.

123
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,740
Which is why, when it comes time to change the clocks, there's always a debate about

124
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,920
whether or not we should.
