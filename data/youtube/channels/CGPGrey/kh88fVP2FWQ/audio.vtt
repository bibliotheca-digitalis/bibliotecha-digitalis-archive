00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
The first people who lived here named themselves.

00:03.080 --> 00:09.560
Across the continent, in hundreds of languages, the word for people, or the first people, was what they used.

00:09.560 --> 00:15.920
Other people existed to trade and talk and fight with, but the continent was vast and travel slow.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.880
There were no horses and wouldn't be for millennia.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.280
No group could know all the others, so there was no single name for all.

00:23.280 --> 00:29.440
Then, from across the sea, came a new other people, who brought with them great and terrible things.

00:29.440 --> 00:36.160
They, too, had a name for themselves, in their own language, but they also brought a name for the first people, Indians.

00:36.160 --> 00:42.280
We are in the future from this past, and you in the future from my present, possibly the far future.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.320
And the word Indian may have just made you uncomfortable.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.920
So let's talk about words.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.480
Words are what we make them.

00:48.480 --> 00:54.000
Without the words surrounding them, without brains to interpret them, words are but whispers of wind.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.560
It's a word's utility to the speaker and the reaction of the listener that causes words to be born and to live and to die.

01:01.560 --> 01:10.160
Long after its first use in the New World, the early British and American empires needed a word to collectively describe the first people.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.400
And Indian, despite its confused origins, was that word.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.200
As the empires expanded, there was terrible conflict.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.320
The first people found themselves decimated and scattered.

01:21.320 --> 01:32.040
Many forcibly moved to reservations, land unknown with others unknown, needing to act as one new group to survive, to hold on to any sovereignty.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.560
As the world progressed from horses to steam to electricity, the nature of conflict changed.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.000
Fewer guns and germs, more mines and laws.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.200
But the first people were now a tiny minority in the land, while also a multiplicity of groups.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.600
For comparison, there are about 200 countries in the world.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.480
Within the United States, the reservations number more than 300.

01:55.480 --> 02:04.560
Within and without those areas of special sovereignty, there are more than 500 federally recognized tribes, each with a different name.

02:04.560 --> 02:12.280
To win the minds of the majority, to get laws securing sovereignty, hundreds of different names for different groups is not helpful.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.000
A collective name, one clear in the minds of the majority, was needed.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
A name useful for unity.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.920
In the time of civil rights, American Indians, shortened to Indians, was, despite its confused origins, that name.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.840
For words are what we make them, and we can unmake them.

02:28.840 --> 02:39.440
As I write this script looking at the past and toward you in the future, I will bet that future history will unmake Indian in favor of Native American or something else.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.040
You know if this has happened.

02:41.040 --> 02:48.480
But here, as part of working on this series, I've traveled to many reservations to see them and to talk to the people who live in them.

02:48.480 --> 02:55.720
On reservations, the word Indian is still used without hesitation or negative connotation, used as identity.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.800
Not universally, but near it.

02:57.800 --> 03:02.000
You, like me, may be surprised to hear that, given the word's confused origins.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.400
But words are what we make them, and Indians have made the word theirs.

03:06.400 --> 03:13.840
Now, as for Native American, while preferred by some, there exists in others a strong dislike and resentment of the name.

03:13.840 --> 03:22.120
The word created to explain this dislike was passed on to me, and the only way to explain fully is to pass it on to you.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.920
So, the dislike comes from over-inclusivity.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.120
I know. I know. I know.

03:33.200 --> 03:37.400
But let's stay thoughtful and examine what this word was created to communicate.

03:37.400 --> 03:46.400
For at least 300 years, Indian has meant the first people in this part of the world, separated at first, but thrust into a shared history.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.200
It is clear. It is sharp.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.920
The word Native American less so.

03:50.920 --> 04:00.200
It can include everyone from the top to bottom of two continents, a vast number of different cultures and current-day goals and concerns.

04:00.200 --> 04:06.560
The histories of North, Central, and South America are as divergent as the histories of Asia, Europe, and Africa.

04:06.560 --> 04:18.560
To call a person from here, here, or here a Native Afro-Eurasian would be so over-inclusive as to make it difficult for that human to strongly identify with, or rally others under.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.640
So it goes for Native American.

04:20.640 --> 04:25.200
Additionally, it can feel like yet another thing forced from the outside.

04:25.200 --> 04:31.520
Talking to people about this project over the last five years revealed a strong correlation.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.920
The closer a person had ever been to a reservation, the more likely they would use Indian.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.360
The farther, the more likely they would use the word Native American.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.640
And that's understandable.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.200
Is Indian okay?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
Maybe.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.360
But Native American won't be wrong.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.280
And it's useful to express concern and sensitivity as an outsider.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.120
But this creates an unstable balance between insider and outsider use of a word.

04:54.120 --> 04:59.080
If the majority hesitates over a word, it slides into uncomfortability, or worse.

04:59.080 --> 05:03.000
If the majority decides a word is unacceptable, so it becomes.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.560
Groups should be able to name themselves, but when they're small, they often can't.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.680
The word used to describe themselves, outsiders, through sheer numbers, redefine.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.040
At the time of writing, this is happening to Indian.

05:16.040 --> 05:23.080
But the leading replacement is not as universally well-regarded inside reservations as those outside may expect.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.280
As we will talk about, many things have been given to the first people.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.760
Promises, and rights, and lands.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.960
Only once used and adopted by them to be taken away.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.480
So it may go again.

05:33.480 --> 05:38.840
Thus, this series will use American Indian or Indian for three main reasons.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.640
One, the word is clear in geography and history.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.880
Limited to the first people of what is now the continental United States.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.640
Two, the tribal governments and the United States government use Indian.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.960
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, staffed by Indians, which mediates between the two governments, also uses Indian.

05:55.960 --> 06:02.680
To call governments and departments and laws by names other than what they are would be pointlessly confusing.

06:02.680 --> 06:09.480
Three, at the time of writing, Indian is used by Indians on Indian reservations to describe themselves.

06:09.480 --> 06:14.760
Okay, we're well past that point where you hear a word so many times, it starts to become meaningless.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.280
Fun fact, there's a word for that.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.560
Semantic satiation.

06:17.560 --> 06:22.600
Delightfully alliterative and will cause itself, but I leave that as an exercise to the viewer.

06:22.600 --> 06:27.320
This has been 1300 words in an attempt to explain one.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.440
That's complete, we can now move on to the next part.
