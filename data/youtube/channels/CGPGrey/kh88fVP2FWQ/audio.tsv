0	3080	The first people who lived here named themselves.
3080	9560	Across the continent, in hundreds of languages, the word for people, or the first people, was what they used.
9560	15920	Other people existed to trade and talk and fight with, but the continent was vast and travel slow.
15920	18880	There were no horses and wouldn't be for millennia.
18880	23280	No group could know all the others, so there was no single name for all.
23280	29440	Then, from across the sea, came a new other people, who brought with them great and terrible things.
29440	36160	They, too, had a name for themselves, in their own language, but they also brought a name for the first people, Indians.
36160	42280	We are in the future from this past, and you in the future from my present, possibly the far future.
42280	45320	And the word Indian may have just made you uncomfortable.
45320	46920	So let's talk about words.
46920	48480	Words are what we make them.
48480	54000	Without the words surrounding them, without brains to interpret them, words are but whispers of wind.
54000	61560	It's a word's utility to the speaker and the reaction of the listener that causes words to be born and to live and to die.
61560	70160	Long after its first use in the New World, the early British and American empires needed a word to collectively describe the first people.
70160	74400	And Indian, despite its confused origins, was that word.
74400	78200	As the empires expanded, there was terrible conflict.
78200	81320	The first people found themselves decimated and scattered.
81320	92040	Many forcibly moved to reservations, land unknown with others unknown, needing to act as one new group to survive, to hold on to any sovereignty.
92040	97560	As the world progressed from horses to steam to electricity, the nature of conflict changed.
97560	101000	Fewer guns and germs, more mines and laws.
101000	107200	But the first people were now a tiny minority in the land, while also a multiplicity of groups.
107200	110600	For comparison, there are about 200 countries in the world.
110600	115480	Within the United States, the reservations number more than 300.
115480	124560	Within and without those areas of special sovereignty, there are more than 500 federally recognized tribes, each with a different name.
124560	132280	To win the minds of the majority, to get laws securing sovereignty, hundreds of different names for different groups is not helpful.
132280	137000	A collective name, one clear in the minds of the majority, was needed.
137000	139000	A name useful for unity.
139000	145920	In the time of civil rights, American Indians, shortened to Indians, was, despite its confused origins, that name.
145920	148840	For words are what we make them, and we can unmake them.
148840	159440	As I write this script looking at the past and toward you in the future, I will bet that future history will unmake Indian in favor of Native American or something else.
159440	161040	You know if this has happened.
161040	168480	But here, as part of working on this series, I've traveled to many reservations to see them and to talk to the people who live in them.
168480	175720	On reservations, the word Indian is still used without hesitation or negative connotation, used as identity.
175720	177800	Not universally, but near it.
177800	182000	You, like me, may be surprised to hear that, given the word's confused origins.
182000	186400	But words are what we make them, and Indians have made the word theirs.
186400	193840	Now, as for Native American, while preferred by some, there exists in others a strong dislike and resentment of the name.
193840	202120	The word created to explain this dislike was passed on to me, and the only way to explain fully is to pass it on to you.
204120	207920	So, the dislike comes from over-inclusivity.
208920	212120	I know. I know. I know.
213200	217400	But let's stay thoughtful and examine what this word was created to communicate.
217400	226400	For at least 300 years, Indian has meant the first people in this part of the world, separated at first, but thrust into a shared history.
226400	228200	It is clear. It is sharp.
228200	230920	The word Native American less so.
230920	240200	It can include everyone from the top to bottom of two continents, a vast number of different cultures and current-day goals and concerns.
240200	246560	The histories of North, Central, and South America are as divergent as the histories of Asia, Europe, and Africa.
246560	258560	To call a person from here, here, or here a Native Afro-Eurasian would be so over-inclusive as to make it difficult for that human to strongly identify with, or rally others under.
258560	260640	So it goes for Native American.
260640	265200	Additionally, it can feel like yet another thing forced from the outside.
265200	271520	Talking to people about this project over the last five years revealed a strong correlation.
271520	275920	The closer a person had ever been to a reservation, the more likely they would use Indian.
275920	279360	The farther, the more likely they would use the word Native American.
279360	280640	And that's understandable.
280640	282200	Is Indian okay?
282200	283200	Maybe.
283200	285360	But Native American won't be wrong.
285360	289280	And it's useful to express concern and sensitivity as an outsider.
289280	294120	But this creates an unstable balance between insider and outsider use of a word.
294120	299080	If the majority hesitates over a word, it slides into uncomfortability, or worse.
299080	303000	If the majority decides a word is unacceptable, so it becomes.
303000	307560	Groups should be able to name themselves, but when they're small, they often can't.
307560	312680	The word used to describe themselves, outsiders, through sheer numbers, redefine.
312680	316040	At the time of writing, this is happening to Indian.
316040	323080	But the leading replacement is not as universally well-regarded inside reservations as those outside may expect.
323080	326280	As we will talk about, many things have been given to the first people.
326280	328760	Promises, and rights, and lands.
328760	331960	Only once used and adopted by them to be taken away.
331960	333480	So it may go again.
333480	338840	Thus, this series will use American Indian or Indian for three main reasons.
338840	341640	One, the word is clear in geography and history.
341640	345880	Limited to the first people of what is now the continental United States.
345880	349640	Two, the tribal governments and the United States government use Indian.
349640	355960	The Bureau of Indian Affairs, staffed by Indians, which mediates between the two governments, also uses Indian.
355960	362680	To call governments and departments and laws by names other than what they are would be pointlessly confusing.
362680	369480	Three, at the time of writing, Indian is used by Indians on Indian reservations to describe themselves.
369480	374760	Okay, we're well past that point where you hear a word so many times, it starts to become meaningless.
374760	376280	Fun fact, there's a word for that.
376280	377560	Semantic satiation.
377560	382600	Delightfully alliterative and will cause itself, but I leave that as an exercise to the viewer.
382600	387320	This has been 1300 words in an attempt to explain one.
387320	390440	That's complete, we can now move on to the next part.
