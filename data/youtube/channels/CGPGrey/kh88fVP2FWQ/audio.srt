1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
The first people who lived here named themselves.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,560
Across the continent, in hundreds of languages, the word for people, or the first people, was what they used.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,920
Other people existed to trade and talk and fight with, but the continent was vast and travel slow.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,880
There were no horses and wouldn't be for millennia.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,280
No group could know all the others, so there was no single name for all.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,440
Then, from across the sea, came a new other people, who brought with them great and terrible things.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,160
They, too, had a name for themselves, in their own language, but they also brought a name for the first people, Indians.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,280
We are in the future from this past, and you in the future from my present, possibly the far future.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,320
And the word Indian may have just made you uncomfortable.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,920
So let's talk about words.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,480
Words are what we make them.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,000
Without the words surrounding them, without brains to interpret them, words are but whispers of wind.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,560
It's a word's utility to the speaker and the reaction of the listener that causes words to be born and to live and to die.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:10,160
Long after its first use in the New World, the early British and American empires needed a word to collectively describe the first people.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,400
And Indian, despite its confused origins, was that word.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,200
As the empires expanded, there was terrible conflict.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,320
The first people found themselves decimated and scattered.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:32,040
Many forcibly moved to reservations, land unknown with others unknown, needing to act as one new group to survive, to hold on to any sovereignty.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,560
As the world progressed from horses to steam to electricity, the nature of conflict changed.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Fewer guns and germs, more mines and laws.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,200
But the first people were now a tiny minority in the land, while also a multiplicity of groups.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,600
For comparison, there are about 200 countries in the world.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,480
Within the United States, the reservations number more than 300.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:04,560
Within and without those areas of special sovereignty, there are more than 500 federally recognized tribes, each with a different name.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,280
To win the minds of the majority, to get laws securing sovereignty, hundreds of different names for different groups is not helpful.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,000
A collective name, one clear in the minds of the majority, was needed.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
A name useful for unity.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,920
In the time of civil rights, American Indians, shortened to Indians, was, despite its confused origins, that name.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,840
For words are what we make them, and we can unmake them.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:39,440
As I write this script looking at the past and toward you in the future, I will bet that future history will unmake Indian in favor of Native American or something else.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,040
You know if this has happened.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,480
But here, as part of working on this series, I've traveled to many reservations to see them and to talk to the people who live in them.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,720
On reservations, the word Indian is still used without hesitation or negative connotation, used as identity.

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,800
Not universally, but near it.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,000
You, like me, may be surprised to hear that, given the word's confused origins.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,400
But words are what we make them, and Indians have made the word theirs.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,840
Now, as for Native American, while preferred by some, there exists in others a strong dislike and resentment of the name.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:22,120
The word created to explain this dislike was passed on to me, and the only way to explain fully is to pass it on to you.

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,920
So, the dislike comes from over-inclusivity.

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,120
I know. I know. I know.

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,400
But let's stay thoughtful and examine what this word was created to communicate.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:46,400
For at least 300 years, Indian has meant the first people in this part of the world, separated at first, but thrust into a shared history.

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
It is clear. It is sharp.

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,920
The word Native American less so.

45
00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:00,200
It can include everyone from the top to bottom of two continents, a vast number of different cultures and current-day goals and concerns.

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,560
The histories of North, Central, and South America are as divergent as the histories of Asia, Europe, and Africa.

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:18,560
To call a person from here, here, or here a Native Afro-Eurasian would be so over-inclusive as to make it difficult for that human to strongly identify with, or rally others under.

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
So it goes for Native American.

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,200
Additionally, it can feel like yet another thing forced from the outside.

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,520
Talking to people about this project over the last five years revealed a strong correlation.

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,920
The closer a person had ever been to a reservation, the more likely they would use Indian.

52
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,360
The farther, the more likely they would use the word Native American.

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,640
And that's understandable.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Is Indian okay?

55
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Maybe.

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,360
But Native American won't be wrong.

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
And it's useful to express concern and sensitivity as an outsider.

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,120
But this creates an unstable balance between insider and outsider use of a word.

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,080
If the majority hesitates over a word, it slides into uncomfortability, or worse.

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,000
If the majority decides a word is unacceptable, so it becomes.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Groups should be able to name themselves, but when they're small, they often can't.

62
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,680
The word used to describe themselves, outsiders, through sheer numbers, redefine.

63
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,040
At the time of writing, this is happening to Indian.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:23,080
But the leading replacement is not as universally well-regarded inside reservations as those outside may expect.

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,280
As we will talk about, many things have been given to the first people.

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,760
Promises, and rights, and lands.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,960
Only once used and adopted by them to be taken away.

68
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,480
So it may go again.

69
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,840
Thus, this series will use American Indian or Indian for three main reasons.

70
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,640
One, the word is clear in geography and history.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,880
Limited to the first people of what is now the continental United States.

72
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,640
Two, the tribal governments and the United States government use Indian.

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,960
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, staffed by Indians, which mediates between the two governments, also uses Indian.

74
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,680
To call governments and departments and laws by names other than what they are would be pointlessly confusing.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,480
Three, at the time of writing, Indian is used by Indians on Indian reservations to describe themselves.

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,760
Okay, we're well past that point where you hear a word so many times, it starts to become meaningless.

77
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,280
Fun fact, there's a word for that.

78
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,560
Semantic satiation.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,600
Delightfully alliterative and will cause itself, but I leave that as an exercise to the viewer.

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,320
This has been 1300 words in an attempt to explain one.

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,440
That's complete, we can now move on to the next part.
