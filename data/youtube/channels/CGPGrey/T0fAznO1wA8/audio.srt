1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
So how does this work exactly?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,220
If you'd like to be a pirate,

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,280
you need understand it is a business.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,260
You can't have a crew or a ship or a brand

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,340
without a business model to support them.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,360
But pirate business is like any other.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,200
Make a product or provide a service to your customers

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,360
in exchange for money.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,960
Then spend that money on equipment and personnel

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,900
to make more product for more customers for more money.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,020
The difference with Piracy Incorporated

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,360
is our customers don't wish to be serviced.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,200
No matter.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
Correct spending on equipment and personnel,

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,480
the business will service them regardless.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,780
Do you have to?

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,720
My boy, if we don't service our customers,

18
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,960
someone else will,

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,580
and the reward for our abstamiousness will be poverty.

20
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,760
In our societal and technological environment

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,800
an economic niche exists

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,400
and this incorporation of pirates fills its shape

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,160
as whiskey fills a barrel.

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,340
Such is life, the motions we choose,

25
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,760
but the sum of forces upon us.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,440
I became a pirate as the gold in this grail

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,600
chose its form.

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,220
The both of us now cogs of this machine

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,120
that profits on the high seas or parishes.

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,200
Okay, profit is income minus expenses

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
and for a pirate company

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,860
income means seizing the biggest booty.

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,700
Pfft.

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,000
Pfft.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Seizing the biggest treasure

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,760
while provoking the least cost inducing resistance.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,220
The captain is more than happy

38
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,800
to explain how we accomplish that through branding.

39
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,840
Branding built on the foundation of a solid business mind you.

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,080
Brands are memorable and battles flashy

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,040
but they don't happen without contracts and spreadsheets.

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,500
Thus, before we set sail

43
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
there will be a contract for the voyage.

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Though we choose not to live under the empire's law

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we still have rules of our own

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
to which all men have input

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,840
and to which all men must agree before setting sail.

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,480
The contract sets the voting methods, codes of conduct,

49
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,400
punishments for violating those codes,

50
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,600
distribution of pay, workman's compensation, et cetera.

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,040
Each pirate enterprise is a bit different

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
but in general it works thusly.

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,820
There are two elected offices,

54
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,540
the captain and the quartermaster.

55
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,280
The captain is not our boss

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,480
but serves at the pleasure of the crew.

57
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,880
If they are unhappy with his strategic decisions

58
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,680
the crew can replace him at any time by a majority vote.

59
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,000
There is no term length with one exception.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Battle is no time for democracy.

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,520
Amidst pandemonium the decider must be free to decide

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,800
but this is the only time the captain cannot be removed.

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,540
And though our branding may give you the impression

64
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,440
the captain is in charge of all things,

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,580
the quartermaster keeps the ship running,

66
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,320
overseeing the men, their quarters, their rations,

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
their agreed upon privileges

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,240
and punishments executed for contract violations.

69
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,560
Everything needed to keep the ship effective and profitable.

70
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,320
Quartermaster, battle master, crew.

71
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,260
Now at the dawn of this new century

72
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,320
a lot of men are qualified to be crew

73
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,000
which means the cost of their labor is low.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So you're not going to pay me much?

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
You misunderstand.

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
That you are here tells me you are not interested

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,740
in traditional employment.

78
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,300
Working nine to five on a ship of the empire

79
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,520
for minimum wage, staying out of trouble

80
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,320
and saving for retirement as banal days pass

81
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,140
eroding the dreams and aspirations of your younger self

82
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,360
leaving you at the end to wonder how it all slipped away.

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
No, your personality matrix shaped entirely by your genetics

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,440
and your environment tend you to engage in risk-taking.

85
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,480
What's genetics?

86
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
Doesn't matter.

87
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,080
Given your situation, you find being an outlaw

88
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
with the possibility of great riches

89
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,200
under the threat of the empire's noose

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
a risk worth considering

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,640
if the riches are large enough, which they are.

92
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,400
As a crewman on a pirate ship, you are not paid in wages

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
but with one share of the profit, same as every crewman.

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,000
The captain gets two shares

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
for the strategic decisions he makes.

96
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,720
The quartermaster, one and one half for his labors.

97
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,760
The surgeon, one and one fourth, same for the carpenter.

98
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,340
Though we do often have difficulty finding surgeons

99
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,100
with the right personality matrix.

100
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,100
So if there is no surgeon, the carpenter will be surgeon.

101
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,060
Shocking, I know.

102
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,980
Such flat and equal compensation

103
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,820
is not what you'll find on empire and merchant ships

104
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,500
where captains and officers are compensated richly

105
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,460
and get special quarters and privileges over the crew.

106
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,420
On a pirate ship, we are all equals achieving a common goal.

107
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,740
Wow, what great guys pirates are.

108
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,920
Such comradery.

109
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,780
No, this is not because we are better and the empire worse

110
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,140
but again, economic inevitability.

111
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,300
Empire and merchant ships are not owned by the men who sail them

112
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,220
but by monarchs or investors

113
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,540
who hire captains and officers to run them.

114
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,140
To ensure loyalty to the owners above crew,

115
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,540
the captain is not only paid much more

116
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,700
but has a share in the ship's profits, which the men do not

117
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,620
and may be granted titles and land upon his successful return.

118
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,580
Meanwhile, the crew hired from the mass of men

119
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,940
with lives of quiet desperation and personality matrices

120
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,540
constraining them inside the law

121
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,220
have only the low price of their undifferentiated labor to offer.

122
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,820
And being inside the law,

123
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,060
their captains can threaten them with corporal punishment on board

124
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,500
with prison or treason off board

125
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,780
backed by the empire and her resources to track down traitors and deserters.

126
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,900
But for us pirates, captain's orders are but the words of one man.

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,220
Outside the law, a majority can take control at any time by force.

128
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,260
It is only our contract that eases this transition.

129
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,420
And at every port, if a man trusts not the contract or the crew,

130
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,580
he can just leave.

131
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,580
There is no pirate empire to track him down.

132
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,860
We have a ship and a business only by our cooperation

133
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,500
and only if we can keep it.

134
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,820
But the incentive is great.

135
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,620
We are not here to sell our labor to distant and disinterested owners

136
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,380
but to taste the fruit of our labors directly.

137
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,420
To make money.

138
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,500
A lot of money for all of us.

139
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,540
The only thing standing in our way, aside from our customers occasionally,

140
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,300
is the subtractor of costs.

141
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,820
If it grows too large, the business will inevitably dissolve

142
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,220
and we won't get paid.

143
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,580
These costs come in mostly two forms.

144
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,620
Ship repairs and people repairs.

145
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,060
For the ship, the rules of supply and demand work against us.

146
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,060
We can't sail into a port of the empire seeking repairs without raising questions.

147
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,740
So we must only visit pirate-friendly ports with pirate-friendly dock workers,

148
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,580
mostly far away in the New World, which raises repair costs considerably.

149
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,620
For pirates, each broken mast or cannon hole is more costly than for the empire.

150
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,740
So, for business reasons, we prefer not to fight.

151
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,220
Also, fighting incurs personnel costs.

152
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,340
Since we know that some crew will be injured in battle, permanently,

153
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,100
and it's just a roll of the cosmic dice as to who and to what,

154
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:36,380
the contract we decide on lists generous compensation for lost legs, arms, hands, eyes.

155
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,660
Thus, after the treasure is seized, the injured are compensated,

156
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,980
the ship is repaired, supplies replenished, the remainder is profit.

157
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,220
The glorious, glorious profit.

158
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,700
And your one share, after one successful voyage with us,

159
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,660
will be worth years of labor with the empire.

160
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,660
So, are you compelled to join?

161
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
I'd like to hear from the captain.
