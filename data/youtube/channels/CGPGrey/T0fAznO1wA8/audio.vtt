00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
So how does this work exactly?

00:01.960 --> 00:03.220
If you'd like to be a pirate,

00:03.220 --> 00:05.280
you need understand it is a business.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.260
You can't have a crew or a ship or a brand

00:08.260 --> 00:10.340
without a business model to support them.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.360
But pirate business is like any other.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.200
Make a product or provide a service to your customers

00:15.200 --> 00:16.360
in exchange for money.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.960
Then spend that money on equipment and personnel

00:18.960 --> 00:21.900
to make more product for more customers for more money.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.020
The difference with Piracy Incorporated

00:24.020 --> 00:27.360
is our customers don't wish to be serviced.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.200
No matter.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.600
Correct spending on equipment and personnel,

00:30.600 --> 00:33.480
the business will service them regardless.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.780
Do you have to?

00:34.780 --> 00:37.720
My boy, if we don't service our customers,

00:37.720 --> 00:38.960
someone else will,

00:38.960 --> 00:42.580
and the reward for our abstamiousness will be poverty.

00:42.580 --> 00:45.760
In our societal and technological environment

00:45.760 --> 00:47.800
an economic niche exists

00:47.800 --> 00:51.400
and this incorporation of pirates fills its shape

00:51.400 --> 00:53.160
as whiskey fills a barrel.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.340
Such is life, the motions we choose,

00:55.340 --> 00:57.760
but the sum of forces upon us.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.440
I became a pirate as the gold in this grail

01:00.440 --> 01:01.600
chose its form.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.220
The both of us now cogs of this machine

01:04.220 --> 01:07.120
that profits on the high seas or parishes.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.200
Okay, profit is income minus expenses

01:10.200 --> 01:11.640
and for a pirate company

01:11.640 --> 01:13.860
income means seizing the biggest booty.

01:13.860 --> 01:14.700
Pfft.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.000
Pfft.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.800
Seizing the biggest treasure

01:17.800 --> 01:20.760
while provoking the least cost inducing resistance.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.220
The captain is more than happy

01:23.220 --> 01:25.800
to explain how we accomplish that through branding.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.840
Branding built on the foundation of a solid business mind you.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.080
Brands are memorable and battles flashy

01:31.080 --> 01:34.040
but they don't happen without contracts and spreadsheets.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.500
Thus, before we set sail

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500
there will be a contract for the voyage.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.000
Though we choose not to live under the empire's law

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
we still have rules of our own

01:42.000 --> 01:43.680
to which all men have input

01:43.680 --> 01:46.840
and to which all men must agree before setting sail.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.480
The contract sets the voting methods, codes of conduct,

01:49.480 --> 01:51.400
punishments for violating those codes,

01:51.400 --> 01:54.600
distribution of pay, workman's compensation, et cetera.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.040
Each pirate enterprise is a bit different

01:57.040 --> 01:59.040
but in general it works thusly.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.820
There are two elected offices,

02:00.820 --> 02:02.540
the captain and the quartermaster.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.280
The captain is not our boss

02:04.280 --> 02:06.480
but serves at the pleasure of the crew.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.880
If they are unhappy with his strategic decisions

02:08.880 --> 02:12.680
the crew can replace him at any time by a majority vote.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.000
There is no term length with one exception.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.440
Battle is no time for democracy.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.520
Amidst pandemonium the decider must be free to decide

02:20.520 --> 02:23.800
but this is the only time the captain cannot be removed.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.540
And though our branding may give you the impression

02:26.540 --> 02:28.440
the captain is in charge of all things,

02:28.440 --> 02:30.580
the quartermaster keeps the ship running,

02:30.580 --> 02:33.320
overseeing the men, their quarters, their rations,

02:33.320 --> 02:34.840
their agreed upon privileges

02:34.840 --> 02:38.240
and punishments executed for contract violations.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.560
Everything needed to keep the ship effective and profitable.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.320
Quartermaster, battle master, crew.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.260
Now at the dawn of this new century

02:46.260 --> 02:48.320
a lot of men are qualified to be crew

02:48.320 --> 02:51.000
which means the cost of their labor is low.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So you're not going to pay me much?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.080
You misunderstand.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.480
That you are here tells me you are not interested

02:56.480 --> 02:57.740
in traditional employment.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.300
Working nine to five on a ship of the empire

03:00.300 --> 03:02.520
for minimum wage, staying out of trouble

03:02.520 --> 03:05.320
and saving for retirement as banal days pass

03:05.320 --> 03:08.140
eroding the dreams and aspirations of your younger self

03:08.140 --> 03:11.360
leaving you at the end to wonder how it all slipped away.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.280
No, your personality matrix shaped entirely by your genetics

03:15.280 --> 03:18.440
and your environment tend you to engage in risk-taking.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.480
What's genetics?

03:19.480 --> 03:20.320
Doesn't matter.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.080
Given your situation, you find being an outlaw

03:23.080 --> 03:25.080
with the possibility of great riches

03:25.080 --> 03:27.200
under the threat of the empire's noose

03:27.200 --> 03:28.720
a risk worth considering

03:28.720 --> 03:31.640
if the riches are large enough, which they are.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.400
As a crewman on a pirate ship, you are not paid in wages

03:34.400 --> 03:37.680
but with one share of the profit, same as every crewman.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.000
The captain gets two shares

03:39.000 --> 03:40.800
for the strategic decisions he makes.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.720
The quartermaster, one and one half for his labors.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.760
The surgeon, one and one fourth, same for the carpenter.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.340
Though we do often have difficulty finding surgeons

03:49.340 --> 03:51.100
with the right personality matrix.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.100
So if there is no surgeon, the carpenter will be surgeon.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.060
Shocking, I know.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.980
Such flat and equal compensation

03:56.980 --> 03:59.820
is not what you'll find on empire and merchant ships

03:59.820 --> 04:02.500
where captains and officers are compensated richly

04:02.500 --> 04:05.460
and get special quarters and privileges over the crew.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.420
On a pirate ship, we are all equals achieving a common goal.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.740
Wow, what great guys pirates are.

04:11.740 --> 04:12.920
Such comradery.

04:14.100 --> 04:17.780
No, this is not because we are better and the empire worse

04:17.780 --> 04:20.140
but again, economic inevitability.

04:20.140 --> 04:23.300
Empire and merchant ships are not owned by the men who sail them

04:23.300 --> 04:25.220
but by monarchs or investors

04:25.220 --> 04:27.540
who hire captains and officers to run them.

04:27.540 --> 04:30.140
To ensure loyalty to the owners above crew,

04:30.140 --> 04:32.540
the captain is not only paid much more

04:32.540 --> 04:35.700
but has a share in the ship's profits, which the men do not

04:35.700 --> 04:39.620
and may be granted titles and land upon his successful return.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.580
Meanwhile, the crew hired from the mass of men

04:42.580 --> 04:45.940
with lives of quiet desperation and personality matrices

04:45.940 --> 04:47.540
constraining them inside the law

04:47.540 --> 04:51.220
have only the low price of their undifferentiated labor to offer.

04:51.220 --> 04:52.820
And being inside the law,

04:52.820 --> 04:56.060
their captains can threaten them with corporal punishment on board

04:56.060 --> 04:58.500
with prison or treason off board

04:58.500 --> 05:02.780
backed by the empire and her resources to track down traitors and deserters.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.900
But for us pirates, captain's orders are but the words of one man.

05:06.900 --> 05:11.220
Outside the law, a majority can take control at any time by force.

05:11.220 --> 05:14.260
It is only our contract that eases this transition.

05:14.260 --> 05:18.420
And at every port, if a man trusts not the contract or the crew,

05:18.420 --> 05:19.580
he can just leave.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.580
There is no pirate empire to track him down.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.860
We have a ship and a business only by our cooperation

05:25.860 --> 05:27.500
and only if we can keep it.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.820
But the incentive is great.

05:28.820 --> 05:32.620
We are not here to sell our labor to distant and disinterested owners

05:32.620 --> 05:35.380
but to taste the fruit of our labors directly.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.420
To make money.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.500
A lot of money for all of us.

05:38.500 --> 05:42.540
The only thing standing in our way, aside from our customers occasionally,

05:42.540 --> 05:44.300
is the subtractor of costs.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.820
If it grows too large, the business will inevitably dissolve

05:47.820 --> 05:49.220
and we won't get paid.

05:49.220 --> 05:51.580
These costs come in mostly two forms.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.620
Ship repairs and people repairs.

05:53.620 --> 05:57.060
For the ship, the rules of supply and demand work against us.

05:57.060 --> 06:02.060
We can't sail into a port of the empire seeking repairs without raising questions.

06:02.060 --> 06:06.740
So we must only visit pirate-friendly ports with pirate-friendly dock workers,

06:06.740 --> 06:11.580
mostly far away in the New World, which raises repair costs considerably.

06:11.580 --> 06:16.620
For pirates, each broken mast or cannon hole is more costly than for the empire.

06:16.620 --> 06:19.740
So, for business reasons, we prefer not to fight.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.220
Also, fighting incurs personnel costs.

06:22.220 --> 06:26.340
Since we know that some crew will be injured in battle, permanently,

06:26.340 --> 06:30.100
and it's just a roll of the cosmic dice as to who and to what,

06:30.100 --> 06:36.380
the contract we decide on lists generous compensation for lost legs, arms, hands, eyes.

06:36.380 --> 06:40.660
Thus, after the treasure is seized, the injured are compensated,

06:40.660 --> 06:44.980
the ship is repaired, supplies replenished, the remainder is profit.

06:44.980 --> 06:47.220
The glorious, glorious profit.

06:47.220 --> 06:50.700
And your one share, after one successful voyage with us,

06:50.700 --> 06:53.660
will be worth years of labor with the empire.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.660
So, are you compelled to join?

06:57.820 --> 06:59.820
I'd like to hear from the captain.
