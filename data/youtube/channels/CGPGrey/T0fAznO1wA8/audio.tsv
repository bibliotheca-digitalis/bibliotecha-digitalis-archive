0	1960	So how does this work exactly?
1960	3220	If you'd like to be a pirate,
3220	5280	you need understand it is a business.
5280	8260	You can't have a crew or a ship or a brand
8260	10340	without a business model to support them.
10340	12360	But pirate business is like any other.
12360	15200	Make a product or provide a service to your customers
15200	16360	in exchange for money.
16360	18960	Then spend that money on equipment and personnel
18960	21900	to make more product for more customers for more money.
21900	24020	The difference with Piracy Incorporated
24020	27360	is our customers don't wish to be serviced.
27360	28200	No matter.
28200	30600	Correct spending on equipment and personnel,
30600	33480	the business will service them regardless.
33480	34780	Do you have to?
34780	37720	My boy, if we don't service our customers,
37720	38960	someone else will,
38960	42580	and the reward for our abstamiousness will be poverty.
42580	45760	In our societal and technological environment
45760	47800	an economic niche exists
47800	51400	and this incorporation of pirates fills its shape
51400	53160	as whiskey fills a barrel.
53160	55340	Such is life, the motions we choose,
55340	57760	but the sum of forces upon us.
57760	60440	I became a pirate as the gold in this grail
60440	61600	chose its form.
61600	64220	The both of us now cogs of this machine
64220	67120	that profits on the high seas or parishes.
67120	70200	Okay, profit is income minus expenses
70200	71640	and for a pirate company
71640	73860	income means seizing the biggest booty.
73860	74700	Pfft.
74700	76000	Pfft.
76000	77800	Seizing the biggest treasure
77800	80760	while provoking the least cost inducing resistance.
80760	83220	The captain is more than happy
83220	85800	to explain how we accomplish that through branding.
85800	88840	Branding built on the foundation of a solid business mind you.
88840	91080	Brands are memorable and battles flashy
91080	94040	but they don't happen without contracts and spreadsheets.
94040	95500	Thus, before we set sail
95500	97500	there will be a contract for the voyage.
97500	100000	Though we choose not to live under the empire's law
100000	102000	we still have rules of our own
102000	103680	to which all men have input
103680	106840	and to which all men must agree before setting sail.
106840	109480	The contract sets the voting methods, codes of conduct,
109480	111400	punishments for violating those codes,
111400	114600	distribution of pay, workman's compensation, et cetera.
114600	117040	Each pirate enterprise is a bit different
117040	119040	but in general it works thusly.
119040	120820	There are two elected offices,
120820	122540	the captain and the quartermaster.
122540	124280	The captain is not our boss
124280	126480	but serves at the pleasure of the crew.
126480	128880	If they are unhappy with his strategic decisions
128880	132680	the crew can replace him at any time by a majority vote.
132680	135000	There is no term length with one exception.
135000	137440	Battle is no time for democracy.
137440	140520	Amidst pandemonium the decider must be free to decide
140520	143800	but this is the only time the captain cannot be removed.
143800	146540	And though our branding may give you the impression
146540	148440	the captain is in charge of all things,
148440	150580	the quartermaster keeps the ship running,
150580	153320	overseeing the men, their quarters, their rations,
153320	154840	their agreed upon privileges
154840	158240	and punishments executed for contract violations.
158240	161560	Everything needed to keep the ship effective and profitable.
161560	164320	Quartermaster, battle master, crew.
164320	166260	Now at the dawn of this new century
166260	168320	a lot of men are qualified to be crew
168320	171000	which means the cost of their labor is low.
171000	173000	So you're not going to pay me much?
173000	174080	You misunderstand.
174080	176480	That you are here tells me you are not interested
176480	177740	in traditional employment.
177740	180300	Working nine to five on a ship of the empire
180300	182520	for minimum wage, staying out of trouble
182520	185320	and saving for retirement as banal days pass
185320	188140	eroding the dreams and aspirations of your younger self
188140	191360	leaving you at the end to wonder how it all slipped away.
191360	195280	No, your personality matrix shaped entirely by your genetics
195280	198440	and your environment tend you to engage in risk-taking.
198440	199480	What's genetics?
199480	200320	Doesn't matter.
200320	203080	Given your situation, you find being an outlaw
203080	205080	with the possibility of great riches
205080	207200	under the threat of the empire's noose
207200	208720	a risk worth considering
208720	211640	if the riches are large enough, which they are.
211640	214400	As a crewman on a pirate ship, you are not paid in wages
214400	217680	but with one share of the profit, same as every crewman.
217680	219000	The captain gets two shares
219000	220800	for the strategic decisions he makes.
220800	223720	The quartermaster, one and one half for his labors.
223720	226760	The surgeon, one and one fourth, same for the carpenter.
226760	229340	Though we do often have difficulty finding surgeons
229340	231100	with the right personality matrix.
231100	234100	So if there is no surgeon, the carpenter will be surgeon.
234100	235060	Shocking, I know.
235060	236980	Such flat and equal compensation
236980	239820	is not what you'll find on empire and merchant ships
239820	242500	where captains and officers are compensated richly
242500	245460	and get special quarters and privileges over the crew.
245460	249420	On a pirate ship, we are all equals achieving a common goal.
249420	251740	Wow, what great guys pirates are.
251740	252920	Such comradery.
254100	257780	No, this is not because we are better and the empire worse
257780	260140	but again, economic inevitability.
260140	263300	Empire and merchant ships are not owned by the men who sail them
263300	265220	but by monarchs or investors
265220	267540	who hire captains and officers to run them.
267540	270140	To ensure loyalty to the owners above crew,
270140	272540	the captain is not only paid much more
272540	275700	but has a share in the ship's profits, which the men do not
275700	279620	and may be granted titles and land upon his successful return.
279620	282580	Meanwhile, the crew hired from the mass of men
282580	285940	with lives of quiet desperation and personality matrices
285940	287540	constraining them inside the law
287540	291220	have only the low price of their undifferentiated labor to offer.
291220	292820	And being inside the law,
292820	296060	their captains can threaten them with corporal punishment on board
296060	298500	with prison or treason off board
298500	302780	backed by the empire and her resources to track down traitors and deserters.
302780	306900	But for us pirates, captain's orders are but the words of one man.
306900	311220	Outside the law, a majority can take control at any time by force.
311220	314260	It is only our contract that eases this transition.
314260	318420	And at every port, if a man trusts not the contract or the crew,
318420	319580	he can just leave.
319580	322580	There is no pirate empire to track him down.
322580	325860	We have a ship and a business only by our cooperation
325860	327500	and only if we can keep it.
327500	328820	But the incentive is great.
328820	332620	We are not here to sell our labor to distant and disinterested owners
332620	335380	but to taste the fruit of our labors directly.
335380	336420	To make money.
336420	338500	A lot of money for all of us.
338500	342540	The only thing standing in our way, aside from our customers occasionally,
342540	344300	is the subtractor of costs.
344300	347820	If it grows too large, the business will inevitably dissolve
347820	349220	and we won't get paid.
349220	351580	These costs come in mostly two forms.
351580	353620	Ship repairs and people repairs.
353620	357060	For the ship, the rules of supply and demand work against us.
357060	362060	We can't sail into a port of the empire seeking repairs without raising questions.
362060	366740	So we must only visit pirate-friendly ports with pirate-friendly dock workers,
366740	371580	mostly far away in the New World, which raises repair costs considerably.
371580	376620	For pirates, each broken mast or cannon hole is more costly than for the empire.
376620	379740	So, for business reasons, we prefer not to fight.
379740	382220	Also, fighting incurs personnel costs.
382220	386340	Since we know that some crew will be injured in battle, permanently,
386340	390100	and it's just a roll of the cosmic dice as to who and to what,
390100	396380	the contract we decide on lists generous compensation for lost legs, arms, hands, eyes.
396380	400660	Thus, after the treasure is seized, the injured are compensated,
400660	404980	the ship is repaired, supplies replenished, the remainder is profit.
404980	407220	The glorious, glorious profit.
407220	410700	And your one share, after one successful voyage with us,
410700	413660	will be worth years of labor with the empire.
413660	415660	So, are you compelled to join?
417820	419820	I'd like to hear from the captain.
