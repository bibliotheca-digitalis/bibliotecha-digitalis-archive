1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,840
I've been inside, locked down, for eight months at this point.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,680
And while I'm naturally an indoor sort of person, you can get too much of a good thing.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:26,440
So I bought this bike for a loud outdoor exercise and to do some exploration to bring back a

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,680
bit of novelty into my samey life.

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,040
But I've been quarantined from COVID so strictly that I'm a bit apprehensive about going outside.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,360
Oh, hello, Swan.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,080
That spring and summer have already passed me by.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,040
I'm not going to miss autumn, too.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,920
So let's head out into this brief and beautiful season and see what pandemic London is like.

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:37,720
You don't have to ask.

11
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,840
You don't have to ask.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,800
You don't have to ask.

13
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,000
You don't have to ask.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,400
You don't have to ask.

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,600
You don't have to ask.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,000
We're going to come back through that tunnel at the end of this.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:34,960
It's a quiet commute today.

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:48,200
Tour time!

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,080
This dragon and the one across the street mark the boundary between London and the city

20
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
of London.

21
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,800
There are ten more dragons that guard the borders that are copies of these two originals,

22
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:25,000
and there is a unique thirteenth dragon that we can find by going down that little street.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:43,080
There he is.

24
00:03:43,080 --> 00:04:06,320
Other spiky wings.

25
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,360
I've seen that London has made a bunch of changes to the roads and bridges to be more

26
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,320
bike-friendly during the pandemic.

27
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
It's great.

28
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:41,120
I hope they keep some of these changes.

29
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
That was my fault.

30
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
That was my fault.

31
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
That was not your fault.

32
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:54,320
Yeah, I am going that way, okay.

33
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,880
I've never seen the Tower of London so quiet.

34
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm used to being here when it's just packed.

35
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,080
On foreign field trips, I always volunteered for the job of shepherding students to the

36
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,760
Tower of London because the British teachers were well over it.

37
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,240
Not me.

38
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Because of this national lockdown, the Tower has had to let go of some of the yeoman warders

39
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,840
who are the famous guards of the Tower and who also live in the Tower and give amazing

40
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,480
tours of the Tower.

41
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,440
It's just tragic, but if you can't sell tickets and you can't open the gift shop, what can

42
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
you do?

43
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,200
I guess when this pandemic is over, if you come to London, visit the Tower, take the

44
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,040
Yeoman tour, keep an eye out for the ravens.

45
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,200
I wasn't sure how far I'd go, so I brought supplies.

46
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,960
My plan this morning was just to get to the Tower and then return to the safety of home,

47
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,520
but I may not forget to see the city like this again, so I'm going to keep pushing.

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:10,160
Looks like a couple of shops are open.

49
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm not going to enter an enclosed space, but good luck to you little cafes.

50
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Wow, that was great.

51
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,200
I'd never seen that little passage before.

52
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,320
Novelty.

53
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
No stopping now.

54
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:22,680
On to the docklands.

55
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:46,800
Oh my God, it's heavy.

56
00:07:46,800 --> 00:08:14,920
Oh my God, it's heavy.

57
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:38,480
Okay, a little rest break.

58
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,240
I know the cause is a global catastrophe, but the result, this feeling of being in an

59
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,680
empty city, if you are the right kind of person, it's ethereal solitude.

60
00:08:50,680 --> 00:09:06,780
I'm going to stay here, recharge, and then I can't not continue onward.

61
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,440
This building at the southern tip of the docklands is one of my favorite buildings in the whole

62
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,600
of London.

63
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,500
It's heartbreakingly missed, and if we go around back, you can see there's a matching

64
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:28,160
one on the other side of the river, and connecting the two is a tunnel from 1899 that's still

65
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
operational.

66
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,480
Once you're here, crossing is irresistible.

67
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:54,280
If the elevator is broken on the other end, I'm going to really regret this.

68
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:14,080
This should be red and blue pages down here.

69
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,020
Here we are.

70
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:27,420
And going around back again, that's where we started.

71
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,940
It has been a long time since I've been to Greenwich, but now that I'm here, might as

72
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,660
well make it to the observatory.

73
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,540
Oh, wow.

74
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:48,380
Okay, so a long-past-gray once taught lessons as part of his teacher training in the National

75
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,220
Maritime Museum.

76
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,140
He was not very good at teaching then.

77
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,980
I'm sorry, National Maritime Museum.

78
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Well, I made it.

79
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:52,140
Now it's a long way back home.

80
00:11:52,140 --> 00:12:07,740
I'm just in time for sunset on the way home.

81
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,940
That's where we were earlier.

82
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:19,360
Boy, there are definitely starting to be too many people around for my comfort level, though.

83
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,620
Looking good, Barad-dur.

84
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,220
Uh-oh, it's starting to rain.

85
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,900
Good thing I brought my shell.

86
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,260
Ooh, so shiny.

87
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,580
Okay, I'm starting to get pretty wet.

88
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:41,540
I need to go inside, and I'm just wondering, out of morbid curiosity, if the big market

89
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,020
around the corner is open.

90
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,100
I probably shouldn't look if it is open, but I can't stop myself from looking.

91
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Oh, my God, it is open.

92
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:22,260
I'm out of here.

93
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,500
It's beautiful on the South Bank, but I've found where all the people are.

94
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,900
Way too many people, getting way too close.

95
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,120
It's a bit overwhelming.

96
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,140
I need to get home.

97
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
I need to decontaminate.

98
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,940
I love these cargo ships.

99
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,940
I wonder where they go.

100
00:13:42,940 --> 00:14:10,940
Okay, I got to get moving.

101
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:28,940
That's the gate I pointed to this morning.

102
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:56,940
They don't call it horse guards for nothing.

103
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:08,060
Barad-dur in the market, way back there.

104
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,300
Almost home, almost safe.
