0	11840	I've been inside, locked down, for eight months at this point.
11840	17680	And while I'm naturally an indoor sort of person, you can get too much of a good thing.
17680	26440	So I bought this bike for a loud outdoor exercise and to do some exploration to bring back a
26440	29680	bit of novelty into my samey life.
29680	37040	But I've been quarantined from COVID so strictly that I'm a bit apprehensive about going outside.
37040	39360	Oh, hello, Swan.
39360	42080	That spring and summer have already passed me by.
42080	44040	I'm not going to miss autumn, too.
44040	51920	So let's head out into this brief and beautiful season and see what pandemic London is like.
81920	97720	You don't have to ask.
97720	102840	You don't have to ask.
102840	107800	You don't have to ask.
107800	114000	You don't have to ask.
114000	119400	You don't have to ask.
119400	124600	You don't have to ask.
124600	130000	We're going to come back through that tunnel at the end of this.
130000	154960	It's a quiet commute today.
154960	168200	Tour time!
168200	174080	This dragon and the one across the street mark the boundary between London and the city
174080	175080	of London.
175080	180800	There are ten more dragons that guard the borders that are copies of these two originals,
180800	205000	and there is a unique thirteenth dragon that we can find by going down that little street.
205000	223080	There he is.
223080	246320	Other spiky wings.
246320	250360	I've seen that London has made a bunch of changes to the roads and bridges to be more
250360	252320	bike-friendly during the pandemic.
252320	253320	It's great.
253320	281120	I hope they keep some of these changes.
282120	283120	That was my fault.
283120	284120	That was my fault.
284120	285120	That was not your fault.
285120	294320	Yeah, I am going that way, okay.
294320	297880	I've never seen the Tower of London so quiet.
297880	300600	I'm used to being here when it's just packed.
300600	305080	On foreign field trips, I always volunteered for the job of shepherding students to the
305080	309760	Tower of London because the British teachers were well over it.
309760	311240	Not me.
311240	315880	Because of this national lockdown, the Tower has had to let go of some of the yeoman warders
315880	322840	who are the famous guards of the Tower and who also live in the Tower and give amazing
322840	324480	tours of the Tower.
324480	330440	It's just tragic, but if you can't sell tickets and you can't open the gift shop, what can
330440	331440	you do?
331440	337200	I guess when this pandemic is over, if you come to London, visit the Tower, take the
337200	340040	Yeoman tour, keep an eye out for the ravens.
340040	345200	I wasn't sure how far I'd go, so I brought supplies.
345200	349960	My plan this morning was just to get to the Tower and then return to the safety of home,
349960	355520	but I may not forget to see the city like this again, so I'm going to keep pushing.
355520	370160	Looks like a couple of shops are open.
370160	375160	I'm not going to enter an enclosed space, but good luck to you little cafes.
400160	419160	Wow, that was great.
419160	422200	I'd never seen that little passage before.
422200	423320	Novelty.
423320	424560	No stopping now.
424560	442680	On to the docklands.
442680	466800	Oh my God, it's heavy.
466800	494920	Oh my God, it's heavy.
494920	518480	Okay, a little rest break.
518480	523240	I know the cause is a global catastrophe, but the result, this feeling of being in an
523240	530680	empty city, if you are the right kind of person, it's ethereal solitude.
530680	546780	I'm going to stay here, recharge, and then I can't not continue onward.
546780	552440	This building at the southern tip of the docklands is one of my favorite buildings in the whole
552440	553600	of London.
553600	560500	It's heartbreakingly missed, and if we go around back, you can see there's a matching
560500	568160	one on the other side of the river, and connecting the two is a tunnel from 1899 that's still
568160	569160	operational.
569160	574480	Once you're here, crossing is irresistible.
574480	594280	If the elevator is broken on the other end, I'm going to really regret this.
594280	614080	This should be red and blue pages down here.
614080	616020	Here we are.
616020	627420	And going around back again, that's where we started.
627420	632940	It has been a long time since I've been to Greenwich, but now that I'm here, might as
632940	636660	well make it to the observatory.
636660	638540	Oh, wow.
638540	648380	Okay, so a long-past-gray once taught lessons as part of his teacher training in the National
648380	650220	Maritime Museum.
650220	652140	He was not very good at teaching then.
652140	656980	I'm sorry, National Maritime Museum.
656980	684980	Well, I made it.
684980	712140	Now it's a long way back home.
712140	727740	I'm just in time for sunset on the way home.
727740	729940	That's where we were earlier.
729940	739360	Boy, there are definitely starting to be too many people around for my comfort level, though.
739360	740620	Looking good, Barad-dur.
740620	743220	Uh-oh, it's starting to rain.
743220	745900	Good thing I brought my shell.
745900	748260	Ooh, so shiny.
748260	753580	Okay, I'm starting to get pretty wet.
753580	761540	I need to go inside, and I'm just wondering, out of morbid curiosity, if the big market
761540	763020	around the corner is open.
763020	768100	I probably shouldn't look if it is open, but I can't stop myself from looking.
768100	777100	Oh, my God, it is open.
777100	802260	I'm out of here.
802260	807500	It's beautiful on the South Bank, but I've found where all the people are.
807500	809900	Way too many people, getting way too close.
809900	811120	It's a bit overwhelming.
811120	813140	I need to get home.
813140	815140	I need to decontaminate.
815140	820940	I love these cargo ships.
820940	822940	I wonder where they go.
822940	850940	Okay, I got to get moving.
850940	868940	That's the gate I pointed to this morning.
868940	896940	They don't call it horse guards for nothing.
896940	908060	Barad-dur in the market, way back there.
908060	910300	Almost home, almost safe.
