00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
I've been inside, locked down, for eight months at this point.

00:11.840 --> 00:17.680
And while I'm naturally an indoor sort of person, you can get too much of a good thing.

00:17.680 --> 00:26.440
So I bought this bike for a loud outdoor exercise and to do some exploration to bring back a

00:26.440 --> 00:29.680
bit of novelty into my samey life.

00:29.680 --> 00:37.040
But I've been quarantined from COVID so strictly that I'm a bit apprehensive about going outside.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.360
Oh, hello, Swan.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.080
That spring and summer have already passed me by.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.040
I'm not going to miss autumn, too.

00:44.040 --> 00:51.920
So let's head out into this brief and beautiful season and see what pandemic London is like.

01:21.920 --> 01:37.720
You don't have to ask.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.840
You don't have to ask.

01:42.840 --> 01:47.800
You don't have to ask.

01:47.800 --> 01:54.000
You don't have to ask.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.400
You don't have to ask.

01:59.400 --> 02:04.600
You don't have to ask.

02:04.600 --> 02:10.000
We're going to come back through that tunnel at the end of this.

02:10.000 --> 02:34.960
It's a quiet commute today.

02:34.960 --> 02:48.200
Tour time!

02:48.200 --> 02:54.080
This dragon and the one across the street mark the boundary between London and the city

02:54.080 --> 02:55.080
of London.

02:55.080 --> 03:00.800
There are ten more dragons that guard the borders that are copies of these two originals,

03:00.800 --> 03:25.000
and there is a unique thirteenth dragon that we can find by going down that little street.

03:25.000 --> 03:43.080
There he is.

03:43.080 --> 04:06.320
Other spiky wings.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.360
I've seen that London has made a bunch of changes to the roads and bridges to be more

04:10.360 --> 04:12.320
bike-friendly during the pandemic.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.320
It's great.

04:13.320 --> 04:41.120
I hope they keep some of these changes.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.120
That was my fault.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.120
That was my fault.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.120
That was not your fault.

04:45.120 --> 04:54.320
Yeah, I am going that way, okay.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.880
I've never seen the Tower of London so quiet.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.600
I'm used to being here when it's just packed.

05:00.600 --> 05:05.080
On foreign field trips, I always volunteered for the job of shepherding students to the

05:05.080 --> 05:09.760
Tower of London because the British teachers were well over it.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.240
Not me.

05:11.240 --> 05:15.880
Because of this national lockdown, the Tower has had to let go of some of the yeoman warders

05:15.880 --> 05:22.840
who are the famous guards of the Tower and who also live in the Tower and give amazing

05:22.840 --> 05:24.480
tours of the Tower.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.440
It's just tragic, but if you can't sell tickets and you can't open the gift shop, what can

05:30.440 --> 05:31.440
you do?

05:31.440 --> 05:37.200
I guess when this pandemic is over, if you come to London, visit the Tower, take the

05:37.200 --> 05:40.040
Yeoman tour, keep an eye out for the ravens.

05:40.040 --> 05:45.200
I wasn't sure how far I'd go, so I brought supplies.

05:45.200 --> 05:49.960
My plan this morning was just to get to the Tower and then return to the safety of home,

05:49.960 --> 05:55.520
but I may not forget to see the city like this again, so I'm going to keep pushing.

05:55.520 --> 06:10.160
Looks like a couple of shops are open.

06:10.160 --> 06:15.160
I'm not going to enter an enclosed space, but good luck to you little cafes.

06:40.160 --> 06:59.160
Wow, that was great.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.200
I'd never seen that little passage before.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.320
Novelty.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.560
No stopping now.

07:04.560 --> 07:22.680
On to the docklands.

07:22.680 --> 07:46.800
Oh my God, it's heavy.

07:46.800 --> 08:14.920
Oh my God, it's heavy.

08:14.920 --> 08:38.480
Okay, a little rest break.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.240
I know the cause is a global catastrophe, but the result, this feeling of being in an

08:43.240 --> 08:50.680
empty city, if you are the right kind of person, it's ethereal solitude.

08:50.680 --> 09:06.780
I'm going to stay here, recharge, and then I can't not continue onward.

09:06.780 --> 09:12.440
This building at the southern tip of the docklands is one of my favorite buildings in the whole

09:12.440 --> 09:13.600
of London.

09:13.600 --> 09:20.500
It's heartbreakingly missed, and if we go around back, you can see there's a matching

09:20.500 --> 09:28.160
one on the other side of the river, and connecting the two is a tunnel from 1899 that's still

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
operational.

09:29.160 --> 09:34.480
Once you're here, crossing is irresistible.

09:34.480 --> 09:54.280
If the elevator is broken on the other end, I'm going to really regret this.

09:54.280 --> 10:14.080
This should be red and blue pages down here.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.020
Here we are.

10:16.020 --> 10:27.420
And going around back again, that's where we started.

10:27.420 --> 10:32.940
It has been a long time since I've been to Greenwich, but now that I'm here, might as

10:32.940 --> 10:36.660
well make it to the observatory.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.540
Oh, wow.

10:38.540 --> 10:48.380
Okay, so a long-past-gray once taught lessons as part of his teacher training in the National

10:48.380 --> 10:50.220
Maritime Museum.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.140
He was not very good at teaching then.

10:52.140 --> 10:56.980
I'm sorry, National Maritime Museum.

10:56.980 --> 11:24.980
Well, I made it.

11:24.980 --> 11:52.140
Now it's a long way back home.

11:52.140 --> 12:07.740
I'm just in time for sunset on the way home.

12:07.740 --> 12:09.940
That's where we were earlier.

12:09.940 --> 12:19.360
Boy, there are definitely starting to be too many people around for my comfort level, though.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.620
Looking good, Barad-dur.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.220
Uh-oh, it's starting to rain.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.900
Good thing I brought my shell.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.260
Ooh, so shiny.

12:28.260 --> 12:33.580
Okay, I'm starting to get pretty wet.

12:33.580 --> 12:41.540
I need to go inside, and I'm just wondering, out of morbid curiosity, if the big market

12:41.540 --> 12:43.020
around the corner is open.

12:43.020 --> 12:48.100
I probably shouldn't look if it is open, but I can't stop myself from looking.

12:48.100 --> 12:57.100
Oh, my God, it is open.

12:57.100 --> 13:22.260
I'm out of here.

13:22.260 --> 13:27.500
It's beautiful on the South Bank, but I've found where all the people are.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.900
Way too many people, getting way too close.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.120
It's a bit overwhelming.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.140
I need to get home.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.140
I need to decontaminate.

13:35.140 --> 13:40.940
I love these cargo ships.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.940
I wonder where they go.

13:42.940 --> 14:10.940
Okay, I got to get moving.

14:10.940 --> 14:28.940
That's the gate I pointed to this morning.

14:28.940 --> 14:56.940
They don't call it horse guards for nothing.

14:56.940 --> 15:08.060
Barad-dur in the market, way back there.

15:08.060 --> 15:10.300
Almost home, almost safe.
