1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
In the United States, the Supreme Court is the highest court,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,840
given the final say on what laws really mean,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,000
and if they're cool with the Constitution.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Well, this power was not given given, but taken.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,680
Back in the day, the Supreme Court ruled it is the duty of the court to say what the law is,

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,120
and everyone went with it.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,480
You might think the law would say what the law is,

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,720
but even the best, most well-intentioned legislators cannot write a law

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
that covers every possible edge case for the rest of time,

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
nor be able to consider how this law will interact with every other law.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,080
So someone's got to make the final call on the law,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
and the Supreme Court is that someone.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,880
This makes the Supreme Court supremely important constitutionally and politically.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,680
While Congress gets to make the laws, and the President gets to enforce the laws,

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,240
it's the nine court justices that both referee and adjust the laws.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,160
So if you're playing the game for pure, maximum political advantage,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,040
you want to influence the refs.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,680
Now, to be above this influence, each justice serves for life,

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,120
so appointing a new one is an irreversible decision that will affect decades of law.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,400
Only when a justice resigns or dies does a seat open.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,120
Filling that seat starts with the President,

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,960
who the Constitution gives the sole absolute power to select a nominee,

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,440
with no restrictions whatsoever on who the nominee can be,

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,920
no prior judicial experience required.

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
But particularly in modern history, presidents tend to select federal judges

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,760
with long and clear case rulings, hoping the past predicts the future.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,800
No surprises please, this is my chance to influence government long after I leave.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,960
Of course, the whole point of justices serving for life is so once in,

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
they are politically beholden to no one,

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,440
and don't have to strategically plan how their current rulings will affect their next career move.

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,320
Getting on the Supreme Court is the final move.

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Now, while the President can nominate whoever they want,

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,080
Congress must approve the nominee.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,920
Well, not the whole Congress.

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,640
The lower house of representatives, with its hundreds of members, gets to do nothing.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,160
It's just the exclusive upper house, with its two senators per state,

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,680
that historically decides with a two-thirds majority.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,200
Before the Senate votes, it puts the nominee in front of the Judiciary Committee,

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,720
which conducts the world's most arduous job interview over weeks,

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,440
asking the nominee just about everything in their lives they've ever done,

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,200
and their opinions on everything that could ever happen.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
All broadcast for the country to watch,

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,520
which is why nominees play their cards close to their chest,

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,880
answering questions about what they would do in theoretical cases with,

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,760
I couldn't possibly comment on a case not before me.

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,280
That would be unbecoming of a future justice.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,640
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the FBI investigates everything private about the nominee's life

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
they might not wish to discuss before the cameras.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
When the Judiciary Committee inquisition is over,

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,800
the whole Senate then gets to vote yay or nay.

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,120
Nay, and the nominee is rejected, and the President must pick someone new to start over.

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,400
But yay, and the Supreme Court has a new justice to help uphold the Constitution.

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Yay! All done.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,320
Thank goodness such a vital process doesn't have any asterisks or political shenanigans.

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,440
Oh.

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Alright.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Let's do this.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,520
First are the normal political shenanigans around election dates.

59
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,480
While the President can nominate as soon as a seat opens,

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,360
there's no timeline for when the Senate has to vote on the nominee,

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,960
and so can just not,

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,480
running out the clock, gambling on the next election getting a President of a different color.

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,040
On the flip side, there's no minimum time either,

64
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,400
so an aligned President and Senate with an unfavorable election looming

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
can work together very quickly to appoint a new justice.

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,240
These are normal election time shenanigans, but shenanigans beget shenanigans.

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,960
So the Senate doesn't work all year round, taking seasonal recesses,

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,880
often in the summer and in the winter.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,520
Or if it's pandemic season, it's recess time too.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,560
If a Supreme Court seat opens while the Senate is on recess,

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,360
according to the Constitution, the President gets to instantly appoint someone straight into the court,

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,320
who gets to stay there through the current Senate recess and the next Senate session.

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,600
This is a recess appointment, and boy does the Senate not like them.

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Even though the appointed recess justice is temporary, there's still a real justice,

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
getting to vote on cases before the court without Senate approval.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,360
And recess appointments aren't just for the Supreme Court, but all sorts of government jobs.

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,680
The constitutional idea being that legislating the government isn't full-time work.

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,920
The Senate, for the first 140 years of its existence, spent half or more of each year in recess.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,760
But executing the government is a full-time job.

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,640
Stuff's gotta get done, even if the Senate is on vacation.

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,760
So the Constitution gave the President the ability to temporarily fill vital positions

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,760
for a minimum length of time, even when the Senate's not around.

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,480
And the Senate will get its say later when they're back to work.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,520
Seems reasonable to me. Don't like it.

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,440
But for 230 years, the Senate did like their Senate recesses,

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,760
and thus Presidents got their temporary recess appointments.

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,880
Until the shenanigans began.

88
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,080
If a seat opened while an unfriendly Senate was in session,

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,960
the President could just wait until they went on recess to make the appointment,

90
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,680
and thus at least get their unalloyed favorite on the court straightaway for a few months.

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Well, if you're going to wait until we're on recess, then we'll never take a recess.

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,080
You want to work all year round? Go right ahead.

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,960
Oh no, we'll take our vacations. Just not a recess.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,880
The Senate had found a constitutional loophole. The pro forma session.

95
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,440
I will now reenact, word for word, a complete day in the Senate with a pro forma session.

96
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,000
I will be playing two parts. The Clerk and the Senator.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Ahem. Begin scene.

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,160
The Senate will come to order. The Clerk will read a communication to the Senate.

99
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,520
To the Senate. Under the provisions of Rule 1, Paragraph 3 of the Standing Rules of the Senate,

100
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,360
I hereby appoint the Honorable Senator from the great state of Delaware

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,360
to perform the duties of the Chair. Signed, President Pro Tempore.

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,640
Under the previous order, I declare the Senate stands adjourned for three days.

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,040
End scene. That's it. An entire work day complete in what is quite often literally less than 20 seconds.

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay, here's what's going on. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate is the longest serving Senator

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,000
who runs the Senate's procedures. But they can temporarily delegate that power to someone else.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,040
This is what the letter the Clerk reads into the record is doing.

107
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,600
Translation, this Senator is in charge today.

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,480
And then the Senator now in charge performs one action.

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,920
Hey everyone, go home. Let's meet again in three days.

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,040
Why three days?

111
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,640
Because the rule in the Constitution is that if the Senate wants to take a three day break,

112
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,400
it can do so any time it likes.

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,480
But a four day break requires approval from the House of Representatives.

114
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,120
But there's no rule against taking a three day break every four days.

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,920
As long as something happens on the fourth day.

116
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,680
And the minimum possible something is the pro forma session that calls for another three day break.

117
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Oh, and by the way, the Senator in charge is the only Senator in the room.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,960
All the others are on vacation.

119
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,880
How is this remotely legit when a quorum of 51 Senators is required

120
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,600
before the Senate can, you know, do anything?

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,360
Well, the Senate itself has decided the rule is to presume that a quorum is present

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,480
unless someone asks for a roll call to show otherwise.

123
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,160
So if the one Senator who is present does not ask for a roll call,

124
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,560
who knows how many Senators are in the room?

125
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
We'll just presume it's 51.

126
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,720
So the Senate takes just as many breaks as it ever did, but is never officially at recess.

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,600
So if a justice unexpectedly resigns or dies,

128
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,400
the President is blocked from making a recess appointment.

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,040
It's impressive rules lawyering according to the Senate,

130
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,120
but shenanigans according to the President.

131
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
So it was inevitable that they would get hauled

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,680
before the Supreme Court to make the final call.

133
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,560
The executive position being, if all the Senators are back at home

134
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,200
except for the one junior kid with orders not to roll call

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,600
and a note to say the magic words, then by no means is the Senate in session.

136
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,360
And the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision completely agreed.

137
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,320
With the Senate.

138
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
Listen executive branch, I know you're annoyed,

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,000
but you don't get to tell the Senate when they're in recess.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
And also now we don't have to work with attempt.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,600
And thus, recess appointments,

142
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,160
while theoretically still part of the appointment process,

143
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,080
will practically never happen again

144
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,880
as long as the Senate keeps up their pro forma sessions.

145
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,760
Even though, delightfully, the Senate's official website

146
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,960
still talks about taking their annual August recess,

147
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,000
which is the political equivalent of one branch of government

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,920
sticking out its tongue at the other.

149
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,800
But shenanigans beget shenanigans.

150
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Now, of course, the Senate is not one thing,

151
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,000
but 100 separate Senators who are or aren't members of the same party as the President.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,760
So while the Senate blocked recess appointments

153
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,920
to always get to perform their confirmations,

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,040
the shenanigans escalation was to get the number of Senators

155
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,120
who need to agree with the President's nomination as low as it can be.

156
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,880
This top, sneaky, shenanigans paperwork plan had the exciting name

157
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,160
The Nuclear Option.

158
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,640
But it's so bureaucratically boring,

159
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,320
the details will induce coma in the listener, speaking from experience.

160
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,120
So we'll skip the details and just get to the results.

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,400
The two-thirds vote needed in the Senate to approve a Supreme Court Justice

162
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,080
was the historical starting place.

163
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,720
But that got whittled down to three-fifths,

164
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,880
then dropped down to half plus one.

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,720
Which, in practical terms, means just one half exactly.

166
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,560
Because when there's a tie in the Senate,

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,120
the Vice President, who will obviously side with the President,

168
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,640
cast the deciding vote.

169
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
Through the nuclear shenanigans,

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,800
it's become much easier for the President's nominee

171
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,640
to get permanently on the bench.

172
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,320
And now the confirmation of the Senate the Constitution requires

173
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,080
can literally mean exactly half of the Senators disapprove.

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,440
Again, rules lawyering or shenanigans is a matter of opinion.

175
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,360
But shenanigans beget shenanigans,

176
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,720
and there are more nuclear options still just waiting to be picked up.

177
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,080
For example, imagine the President and Senate get a justice on the court

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,880
and then later a government of a different color is elected.

179
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,560
Because justices serve for life,

180
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
there's nothing the executive and legislative branches can do

181
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,840
until the justice dies or resigns.

182
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,520
Or is there?

183
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,080
Oh, what's this? Judicial impeachment?

184
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
I didn't know that was an option.

185
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,480
It is.

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,640
Surprise! Congress can impeach and remove Supreme Court justices.

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,720
Now, this has never happened fully.

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,520
There was one impeachment hearing of a Supreme Court justice

189
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,200
back at the start of the 1800s,

190
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
but the vote to convict didn't pass.

191
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,880
The whole incident set the precedent

192
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,920
that the Supreme Court should be left out of partisan politics

193
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,800
and justices shouldn't be removed for political advantage.

194
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,720
But precedents aren't laws,

195
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,280
and this incident did leave a little unclear

196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
what the reasons to impeach could be.

197
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,320
So that nuclear option is lying around.

198
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,560
Another technically possible nuclear shenanigans is forced recess.

199
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,240
The Constitution does have this power

200
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,720
where the President can quote from time to time

201
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,560
force the Congress back to the Capitol,

202
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,200
presumably to sort out some emergency business,

203
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
like in a war or a pandemic,

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,120
and then can forcibly dismiss them when done.

205
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,040
Now, the exact clause has this weird detail

206
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,960
that if the Senate and House don't agree

207
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,320
on how long the recess will be, the President gets to decide.

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,560
So if the Congress was on recess,

209
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,920
and if the President called them back to then immediately dismiss them,

210
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,200
and if the Houses disagreed on how long the recess would be,

211
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,520
then the President could force a long recess

212
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,400
and make recess appointments till their hearts content.

213
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
It shouldn't take much imagination

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,280
to see why the forced dismissal of Congress by the President

215
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,520
would be the most truly of nuclear shenanigans

216
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,720
and the fallout would affect, like, every part of the government.

217
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
But that's the sort of thing that can happen

218
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,960
when shenanigans infinitely escalate.

219
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,000
And given the supreme importance of the Supreme Court,

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,960
doubtless the rules lawyers are always looking for more.

221
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,840
Two recurring nukes being either trying to get term limits

222
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,120
on the Supreme Court justices,

223
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,880
but only when it's politically advantageous

224
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,440
and also to make the justices more politically influenceable,

225
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,640
or failing that, simply packing the court with more.

226
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,560
But of course, if and when any possible nuclear shenanigans triggered,

227
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,200
doubtless the Supreme Court will instantly get involved

228
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,640
to make the final call.

229
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,280
And if their earlier decisions are anything to go by,

230
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,520
don't bet a lot of money on the court deciding

231
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,840
to make it easier to mess with the court.

232
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,880
But who knows?

233
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,640
In the meantime, the current possible process is pretty straightforward.

234
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,880
The Senate never goes on recess officially,

235
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,600
so when a seat opens, the President picks a nominee

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,800
and half or more of the Senate must confirm that nominee

237
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
to the highest court of the land.
