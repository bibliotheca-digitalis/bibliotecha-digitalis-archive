0	3040	In the United States, the Supreme Court is the highest court,
3040	5840	given the final say on what laws really mean,
5840	8000	and if they're cool with the Constitution.
8000	10760	Well, this power was not given given, but taken.
10760	15680	Back in the day, the Supreme Court ruled it is the duty of the court to say what the law is,
15680	17120	and everyone went with it.
17120	19480	You might think the law would say what the law is,
19480	22720	but even the best, most well-intentioned legislators cannot write a law
22720	25920	that covers every possible edge case for the rest of time,
25920	29920	nor be able to consider how this law will interact with every other law.
29920	32080	So someone's got to make the final call on the law,
32080	34080	and the Supreme Court is that someone.
34080	39880	This makes the Supreme Court supremely important constitutionally and politically.
39880	43680	While Congress gets to make the laws, and the President gets to enforce the laws,
43680	48240	it's the nine court justices that both referee and adjust the laws.
48240	52160	So if you're playing the game for pure, maximum political advantage,
52160	54040	you want to influence the refs.
54040	57680	Now, to be above this influence, each justice serves for life,
57680	63120	so appointing a new one is an irreversible decision that will affect decades of law.
63120	66400	Only when a justice resigns or dies does a seat open.
66400	68120	Filling that seat starts with the President,
68120	71960	who the Constitution gives the sole absolute power to select a nominee,
71960	75440	with no restrictions whatsoever on who the nominee can be,
75440	77920	no prior judicial experience required.
77920	81920	But particularly in modern history, presidents tend to select federal judges
81920	85760	with long and clear case rulings, hoping the past predicts the future.
85760	89800	No surprises please, this is my chance to influence government long after I leave.
89800	92960	Of course, the whole point of justices serving for life is so once in,
92960	94720	they are politically beholden to no one,
94720	99440	and don't have to strategically plan how their current rulings will affect their next career move.
99440	102320	Getting on the Supreme Court is the final move.
102320	104880	Now, while the President can nominate whoever they want,
104880	107080	Congress must approve the nominee.
107080	108920	Well, not the whole Congress.
108920	113640	The lower house of representatives, with its hundreds of members, gets to do nothing.
113640	117160	It's just the exclusive upper house, with its two senators per state,
117160	120680	that historically decides with a two-thirds majority.
120680	124200	Before the Senate votes, it puts the nominee in front of the Judiciary Committee,
124200	127720	which conducts the world's most arduous job interview over weeks,
127720	131440	asking the nominee just about everything in their lives they've ever done,
131440	134200	and their opinions on everything that could ever happen.
134200	136600	All broadcast for the country to watch,
136600	139520	which is why nominees play their cards close to their chest,
139520	142880	answering questions about what they would do in theoretical cases with,
142880	145760	I couldn't possibly comment on a case not before me.
145760	148280	That would be unbecoming of a future justice.
148280	152640	Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the FBI investigates everything private about the nominee's life
152640	155280	they might not wish to discuss before the cameras.
155280	157360	When the Judiciary Committee inquisition is over,
157360	159800	the whole Senate then gets to vote yay or nay.
159800	164120	Nay, and the nominee is rejected, and the President must pick someone new to start over.
164120	168400	But yay, and the Supreme Court has a new justice to help uphold the Constitution.
168400	170000	Yay! All done.
170000	175320	Thank goodness such a vital process doesn't have any asterisks or political shenanigans.
175320	176440	Oh.
176440	177440	Alright.
177440	178200	Let's do this.
178200	181520	First are the normal political shenanigans around election dates.
181520	184480	While the President can nominate as soon as a seat opens,
184480	187360	there's no timeline for when the Senate has to vote on the nominee,
187360	188960	and so can just not,
188960	193480	running out the clock, gambling on the next election getting a President of a different color.
193480	196040	On the flip side, there's no minimum time either,
196040	200400	so an aligned President and Senate with an unfavorable election looming
200400	203600	can work together very quickly to appoint a new justice.
203600	208240	These are normal election time shenanigans, but shenanigans beget shenanigans.
208240	211960	So the Senate doesn't work all year round, taking seasonal recesses,
211960	213880	often in the summer and in the winter.
213880	216520	Or if it's pandemic season, it's recess time too.
216520	219560	If a Supreme Court seat opens while the Senate is on recess,
219560	224360	according to the Constitution, the President gets to instantly appoint someone straight into the court,
224360	229320	who gets to stay there through the current Senate recess and the next Senate session.
229320	233600	This is a recess appointment, and boy does the Senate not like them.
233600	238000	Even though the appointed recess justice is temporary, there's still a real justice,
238000	241400	getting to vote on cases before the court without Senate approval.
241400	246360	And recess appointments aren't just for the Supreme Court, but all sorts of government jobs.
246360	250680	The constitutional idea being that legislating the government isn't full-time work.
250680	255920	The Senate, for the first 140 years of its existence, spent half or more of each year in recess.
255920	258760	But executing the government is a full-time job.
258760	261640	Stuff's gotta get done, even if the Senate is on vacation.
261640	265760	So the Constitution gave the President the ability to temporarily fill vital positions
265760	268760	for a minimum length of time, even when the Senate's not around.
268760	271480	And the Senate will get its say later when they're back to work.
271480	274520	Seems reasonable to me. Don't like it.
274520	278440	But for 230 years, the Senate did like their Senate recesses,
278440	281760	and thus Presidents got their temporary recess appointments.
281760	283880	Until the shenanigans began.
283880	287080	If a seat opened while an unfriendly Senate was in session,
287080	290960	the President could just wait until they went on recess to make the appointment,
290960	295680	and thus at least get their unalloyed favorite on the court straightaway for a few months.
295680	299680	Well, if you're going to wait until we're on recess, then we'll never take a recess.
299680	302080	You want to work all year round? Go right ahead.
302080	305960	Oh no, we'll take our vacations. Just not a recess.
306000	309880	The Senate had found a constitutional loophole. The pro forma session.
309880	314440	I will now reenact, word for word, a complete day in the Senate with a pro forma session.
314440	317000	I will be playing two parts. The Clerk and the Senator.
317000	318600	Ahem. Begin scene.
318600	322160	The Senate will come to order. The Clerk will read a communication to the Senate.
322160	326520	To the Senate. Under the provisions of Rule 1, Paragraph 3 of the Standing Rules of the Senate,
326520	329360	I hereby appoint the Honorable Senator from the great state of Delaware
329360	332360	to perform the duties of the Chair. Signed, President Pro Tempore.
332360	335640	Under the previous order, I declare the Senate stands adjourned for three days.
336040	342040	End scene. That's it. An entire work day complete in what is quite often literally less than 20 seconds.
342040	345720	Okay, here's what's going on. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate is the longest serving Senator
345720	351000	who runs the Senate's procedures. But they can temporarily delegate that power to someone else.
351000	354040	This is what the letter the Clerk reads into the record is doing.
354040	356600	Translation, this Senator is in charge today.
356600	359480	And then the Senator now in charge performs one action.
359480	362920	Hey everyone, go home. Let's meet again in three days.
362920	364040	Why three days?
364120	367640	Because the rule in the Constitution is that if the Senate wants to take a three day break,
367640	369400	it can do so any time it likes.
369400	373480	But a four day break requires approval from the House of Representatives.
373480	378120	But there's no rule against taking a three day break every four days.
378120	380920	As long as something happens on the fourth day.
380920	386680	And the minimum possible something is the pro forma session that calls for another three day break.
386680	391800	Oh, and by the way, the Senator in charge is the only Senator in the room.
391800	393960	All the others are on vacation.
393960	397880	How is this remotely legit when a quorum of 51 Senators is required
397880	400600	before the Senate can, you know, do anything?
400600	404360	Well, the Senate itself has decided the rule is to presume that a quorum is present
404360	407480	unless someone asks for a roll call to show otherwise.
407480	411160	So if the one Senator who is present does not ask for a roll call,
411160	413560	who knows how many Senators are in the room?
413560	414840	We'll just presume it's 51.
414840	419720	So the Senate takes just as many breaks as it ever did, but is never officially at recess.
419720	422600	So if a justice unexpectedly resigns or dies,
422600	425400	the President is blocked from making a recess appointment.
425400	428040	It's impressive rules lawyering according to the Senate,
428040	430120	but shenanigans according to the President.
430120	432120	So it was inevitable that they would get hauled
432120	434680	before the Supreme Court to make the final call.
434680	437560	The executive position being, if all the Senators are back at home
437560	440200	except for the one junior kid with orders not to roll call
440200	444600	and a note to say the magic words, then by no means is the Senate in session.
444600	448360	And the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision completely agreed.
448360	449320	With the Senate.
449320	450920	Listen executive branch, I know you're annoyed,
450920	453000	but you don't get to tell the Senate when they're in recess.
453000	454920	And also now we don't have to work with attempt.
454920	456600	And thus, recess appointments,
456600	459160	while theoretically still part of the appointment process,
459160	461080	will practically never happen again
461080	463880	as long as the Senate keeps up their pro forma sessions.
463880	466760	Even though, delightfully, the Senate's official website
466760	469960	still talks about taking their annual August recess,
469960	473000	which is the political equivalent of one branch of government
473000	474920	sticking out its tongue at the other.
474920	477800	But shenanigans beget shenanigans.
477800	480040	Now, of course, the Senate is not one thing,
480040	485000	but 100 separate Senators who are or aren't members of the same party as the President.
485000	486760	So while the Senate blocked recess appointments
486760	488920	to always get to perform their confirmations,
488920	492040	the shenanigans escalation was to get the number of Senators
492040	496120	who need to agree with the President's nomination as low as it can be.
496120	499880	This top, sneaky, shenanigans paperwork plan had the exciting name
499880	501160	The Nuclear Option.
501160	503640	But it's so bureaucratically boring,
503640	507320	the details will induce coma in the listener, speaking from experience.
507400	510120	So we'll skip the details and just get to the results.
510120	513400	The two-thirds vote needed in the Senate to approve a Supreme Court Justice
513400	515080	was the historical starting place.
515080	517720	But that got whittled down to three-fifths,
517720	519880	then dropped down to half plus one.
519880	523720	Which, in practical terms, means just one half exactly.
523720	525560	Because when there's a tie in the Senate,
525560	528120	the Vice President, who will obviously side with the President,
528120	529640	cast the deciding vote.
529640	531240	Through the nuclear shenanigans,
531240	533800	it's become much easier for the President's nominee
533800	535640	to get permanently on the bench.
535640	539320	And now the confirmation of the Senate the Constitution requires
539320	543080	can literally mean exactly half of the Senators disapprove.
543080	546440	Again, rules lawyering or shenanigans is a matter of opinion.
546440	548360	But shenanigans beget shenanigans,
548360	551720	and there are more nuclear options still just waiting to be picked up.
551720	555080	For example, imagine the President and Senate get a justice on the court
555080	557880	and then later a government of a different color is elected.
557880	559560	Because justices serve for life,
559560	562520	there's nothing the executive and legislative branches can do
562520	564840	until the justice dies or resigns.
564920	566520	Or is there?
566520	569080	Oh, what's this? Judicial impeachment?
569080	570840	I didn't know that was an option.
570840	571480	It is.
571480	575640	Surprise! Congress can impeach and remove Supreme Court justices.
575640	577720	Now, this has never happened fully.
577720	580520	There was one impeachment hearing of a Supreme Court justice
580520	582200	back at the start of the 1800s,
582200	584200	but the vote to convict didn't pass.
584200	585880	The whole incident set the precedent
585880	588920	that the Supreme Court should be left out of partisan politics
588920	591800	and justices shouldn't be removed for political advantage.
591800	593720	But precedents aren't laws,
593720	596280	and this incident did leave a little unclear
596280	598520	what the reasons to impeach could be.
598520	601320	So that nuclear option is lying around.
601320	605560	Another technically possible nuclear shenanigans is forced recess.
605560	607240	The Constitution does have this power
607240	609720	where the President can quote from time to time
609720	611560	force the Congress back to the Capitol,
611560	614200	presumably to sort out some emergency business,
614200	615800	like in a war or a pandemic,
615800	618120	and then can forcibly dismiss them when done.
618120	620040	Now, the exact clause has this weird detail
620040	621960	that if the Senate and House don't agree
621960	625320	on how long the recess will be, the President gets to decide.
625320	627560	So if the Congress was on recess,
627560	630920	and if the President called them back to then immediately dismiss them,
630920	634200	and if the Houses disagreed on how long the recess would be,
634200	636520	then the President could force a long recess
636520	639400	and make recess appointments till their hearts content.
639400	641000	It shouldn't take much imagination
641000	644280	to see why the forced dismissal of Congress by the President
644280	646520	would be the most truly of nuclear shenanigans
646520	649720	and the fallout would affect, like, every part of the government.
649720	651720	But that's the sort of thing that can happen
651720	653960	when shenanigans infinitely escalate.
653960	657000	And given the supreme importance of the Supreme Court,
657000	659960	doubtless the rules lawyers are always looking for more.
659960	662840	Two recurring nukes being either trying to get term limits
662840	664120	on the Supreme Court justices,
664120	665880	but only when it's politically advantageous
665880	668440	and also to make the justices more politically influenceable,
668440	671640	or failing that, simply packing the court with more.
671640	675560	But of course, if and when any possible nuclear shenanigans triggered,
675560	678200	doubtless the Supreme Court will instantly get involved
678200	679640	to make the final call.
679640	682280	And if their earlier decisions are anything to go by,
682280	684520	don't bet a lot of money on the court deciding
684520	686840	to make it easier to mess with the court.
686840	687880	But who knows?
687880	691640	In the meantime, the current possible process is pretty straightforward.
691640	693880	The Senate never goes on recess officially,
693880	696600	so when a seat opens, the President picks a nominee
696600	699800	and half or more of the Senate must confirm that nominee
699800	701800	to the highest court of the land.
