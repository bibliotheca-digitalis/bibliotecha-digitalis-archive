00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
In the United States, the Supreme Court is the highest court,

00:03.040 --> 00:05.840
given the final say on what laws really mean,

00:05.840 --> 00:08.000
and if they're cool with the Constitution.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.760
Well, this power was not given given, but taken.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.680
Back in the day, the Supreme Court ruled it is the duty of the court to say what the law is,

00:15.680 --> 00:17.120
and everyone went with it.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.480
You might think the law would say what the law is,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.720
but even the best, most well-intentioned legislators cannot write a law

00:22.720 --> 00:25.920
that covers every possible edge case for the rest of time,

00:25.920 --> 00:29.920
nor be able to consider how this law will interact with every other law.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.080
So someone's got to make the final call on the law,

00:32.080 --> 00:34.080
and the Supreme Court is that someone.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.880
This makes the Supreme Court supremely important constitutionally and politically.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.680
While Congress gets to make the laws, and the President gets to enforce the laws,

00:43.680 --> 00:48.240
it's the nine court justices that both referee and adjust the laws.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.160
So if you're playing the game for pure, maximum political advantage,

00:52.160 --> 00:54.040
you want to influence the refs.

00:54.040 --> 00:57.680
Now, to be above this influence, each justice serves for life,

00:57.680 --> 01:03.120
so appointing a new one is an irreversible decision that will affect decades of law.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.400
Only when a justice resigns or dies does a seat open.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.120
Filling that seat starts with the President,

01:08.120 --> 01:11.960
who the Constitution gives the sole absolute power to select a nominee,

01:11.960 --> 01:15.440
with no restrictions whatsoever on who the nominee can be,

01:15.440 --> 01:17.920
no prior judicial experience required.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.920
But particularly in modern history, presidents tend to select federal judges

01:21.920 --> 01:25.760
with long and clear case rulings, hoping the past predicts the future.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.800
No surprises please, this is my chance to influence government long after I leave.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.960
Of course, the whole point of justices serving for life is so once in,

01:32.960 --> 01:34.720
they are politically beholden to no one,

01:34.720 --> 01:39.440
and don't have to strategically plan how their current rulings will affect their next career move.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.320
Getting on the Supreme Court is the final move.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.880
Now, while the President can nominate whoever they want,

01:44.880 --> 01:47.080
Congress must approve the nominee.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.920
Well, not the whole Congress.

01:48.920 --> 01:53.640
The lower house of representatives, with its hundreds of members, gets to do nothing.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.160
It's just the exclusive upper house, with its two senators per state,

01:57.160 --> 02:00.680
that historically decides with a two-thirds majority.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.200
Before the Senate votes, it puts the nominee in front of the Judiciary Committee,

02:04.200 --> 02:07.720
which conducts the world's most arduous job interview over weeks,

02:07.720 --> 02:11.440
asking the nominee just about everything in their lives they've ever done,

02:11.440 --> 02:14.200
and their opinions on everything that could ever happen.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.600
All broadcast for the country to watch,

02:16.600 --> 02:19.520
which is why nominees play their cards close to their chest,

02:19.520 --> 02:22.880
answering questions about what they would do in theoretical cases with,

02:22.880 --> 02:25.760
I couldn't possibly comment on a case not before me.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.280
That would be unbecoming of a future justice.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.640
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the FBI investigates everything private about the nominee's life

02:32.640 --> 02:35.280
they might not wish to discuss before the cameras.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.360
When the Judiciary Committee inquisition is over,

02:37.360 --> 02:39.800
the whole Senate then gets to vote yay or nay.

02:39.800 --> 02:44.120
Nay, and the nominee is rejected, and the President must pick someone new to start over.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.400
But yay, and the Supreme Court has a new justice to help uphold the Constitution.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.000
Yay! All done.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.320
Thank goodness such a vital process doesn't have any asterisks or political shenanigans.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.440
Oh.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.440
Alright.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.200
Let's do this.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.520
First are the normal political shenanigans around election dates.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.480
While the President can nominate as soon as a seat opens,

03:04.480 --> 03:07.360
there's no timeline for when the Senate has to vote on the nominee,

03:07.360 --> 03:08.960
and so can just not,

03:08.960 --> 03:13.480
running out the clock, gambling on the next election getting a President of a different color.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.040
On the flip side, there's no minimum time either,

03:16.040 --> 03:20.400
so an aligned President and Senate with an unfavorable election looming

03:20.400 --> 03:23.600
can work together very quickly to appoint a new justice.

03:23.600 --> 03:28.240
These are normal election time shenanigans, but shenanigans beget shenanigans.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.960
So the Senate doesn't work all year round, taking seasonal recesses,

03:31.960 --> 03:33.880
often in the summer and in the winter.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.520
Or if it's pandemic season, it's recess time too.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.560
If a Supreme Court seat opens while the Senate is on recess,

03:39.560 --> 03:44.360
according to the Constitution, the President gets to instantly appoint someone straight into the court,

03:44.360 --> 03:49.320
who gets to stay there through the current Senate recess and the next Senate session.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.600
This is a recess appointment, and boy does the Senate not like them.

03:53.600 --> 03:58.000
Even though the appointed recess justice is temporary, there's still a real justice,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.400
getting to vote on cases before the court without Senate approval.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.360
And recess appointments aren't just for the Supreme Court, but all sorts of government jobs.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.680
The constitutional idea being that legislating the government isn't full-time work.

04:10.680 --> 04:15.920
The Senate, for the first 140 years of its existence, spent half or more of each year in recess.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.760
But executing the government is a full-time job.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.640
Stuff's gotta get done, even if the Senate is on vacation.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.760
So the Constitution gave the President the ability to temporarily fill vital positions

04:25.760 --> 04:28.760
for a minimum length of time, even when the Senate's not around.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.480
And the Senate will get its say later when they're back to work.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.520
Seems reasonable to me. Don't like it.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.440
But for 230 years, the Senate did like their Senate recesses,

04:38.440 --> 04:41.760
and thus Presidents got their temporary recess appointments.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.880
Until the shenanigans began.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.080
If a seat opened while an unfriendly Senate was in session,

04:47.080 --> 04:50.960
the President could just wait until they went on recess to make the appointment,

04:50.960 --> 04:55.680
and thus at least get their unalloyed favorite on the court straightaway for a few months.

04:55.680 --> 04:59.680
Well, if you're going to wait until we're on recess, then we'll never take a recess.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.080
You want to work all year round? Go right ahead.

05:02.080 --> 05:05.960
Oh no, we'll take our vacations. Just not a recess.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.880
The Senate had found a constitutional loophole. The pro forma session.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.440
I will now reenact, word for word, a complete day in the Senate with a pro forma session.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.000
I will be playing two parts. The Clerk and the Senator.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.600
Ahem. Begin scene.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.160
The Senate will come to order. The Clerk will read a communication to the Senate.

05:22.160 --> 05:26.520
To the Senate. Under the provisions of Rule 1, Paragraph 3 of the Standing Rules of the Senate,

05:26.520 --> 05:29.360
I hereby appoint the Honorable Senator from the great state of Delaware

05:29.360 --> 05:32.360
to perform the duties of the Chair. Signed, President Pro Tempore.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.640
Under the previous order, I declare the Senate stands adjourned for three days.

05:36.040 --> 05:42.040
End scene. That's it. An entire work day complete in what is quite often literally less than 20 seconds.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.720
Okay, here's what's going on. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate is the longest serving Senator

05:45.720 --> 05:51.000
who runs the Senate's procedures. But they can temporarily delegate that power to someone else.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.040
This is what the letter the Clerk reads into the record is doing.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.600
Translation, this Senator is in charge today.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.480
And then the Senator now in charge performs one action.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.920
Hey everyone, go home. Let's meet again in three days.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.040
Why three days?

06:04.120 --> 06:07.640
Because the rule in the Constitution is that if the Senate wants to take a three day break,

06:07.640 --> 06:09.400
it can do so any time it likes.

06:09.400 --> 06:13.480
But a four day break requires approval from the House of Representatives.

06:13.480 --> 06:18.120
But there's no rule against taking a three day break every four days.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.920
As long as something happens on the fourth day.

06:20.920 --> 06:26.680
And the minimum possible something is the pro forma session that calls for another three day break.

06:26.680 --> 06:31.800
Oh, and by the way, the Senator in charge is the only Senator in the room.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.960
All the others are on vacation.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.880
How is this remotely legit when a quorum of 51 Senators is required

06:37.880 --> 06:40.600
before the Senate can, you know, do anything?

06:40.600 --> 06:44.360
Well, the Senate itself has decided the rule is to presume that a quorum is present

06:44.360 --> 06:47.480
unless someone asks for a roll call to show otherwise.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.160
So if the one Senator who is present does not ask for a roll call,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.560
who knows how many Senators are in the room?

06:53.560 --> 06:54.840
We'll just presume it's 51.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.720
So the Senate takes just as many breaks as it ever did, but is never officially at recess.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.600
So if a justice unexpectedly resigns or dies,

07:02.600 --> 07:05.400
the President is blocked from making a recess appointment.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.040
It's impressive rules lawyering according to the Senate,

07:08.040 --> 07:10.120
but shenanigans according to the President.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.120
So it was inevitable that they would get hauled

07:12.120 --> 07:14.680
before the Supreme Court to make the final call.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.560
The executive position being, if all the Senators are back at home

07:17.560 --> 07:20.200
except for the one junior kid with orders not to roll call

07:20.200 --> 07:24.600
and a note to say the magic words, then by no means is the Senate in session.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.360
And the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision completely agreed.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.320
With the Senate.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.920
Listen executive branch, I know you're annoyed,

07:30.920 --> 07:33.000
but you don't get to tell the Senate when they're in recess.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.920
And also now we don't have to work with attempt.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.600
And thus, recess appointments,

07:36.600 --> 07:39.160
while theoretically still part of the appointment process,

07:39.160 --> 07:41.080
will practically never happen again

07:41.080 --> 07:43.880
as long as the Senate keeps up their pro forma sessions.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.760
Even though, delightfully, the Senate's official website

07:46.760 --> 07:49.960
still talks about taking their annual August recess,

07:49.960 --> 07:53.000
which is the political equivalent of one branch of government

07:53.000 --> 07:54.920
sticking out its tongue at the other.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.800
But shenanigans beget shenanigans.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.040
Now, of course, the Senate is not one thing,

08:00.040 --> 08:05.000
but 100 separate Senators who are or aren't members of the same party as the President.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.760
So while the Senate blocked recess appointments

08:06.760 --> 08:08.920
to always get to perform their confirmations,

08:08.920 --> 08:12.040
the shenanigans escalation was to get the number of Senators

08:12.040 --> 08:16.120
who need to agree with the President's nomination as low as it can be.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.880
This top, sneaky, shenanigans paperwork plan had the exciting name

08:19.880 --> 08:21.160
The Nuclear Option.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.640
But it's so bureaucratically boring,

08:23.640 --> 08:27.320
the details will induce coma in the listener, speaking from experience.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.120
So we'll skip the details and just get to the results.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.400
The two-thirds vote needed in the Senate to approve a Supreme Court Justice

08:33.400 --> 08:35.080
was the historical starting place.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.720
But that got whittled down to three-fifths,

08:37.720 --> 08:39.880
then dropped down to half plus one.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.720
Which, in practical terms, means just one half exactly.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.560
Because when there's a tie in the Senate,

08:45.560 --> 08:48.120
the Vice President, who will obviously side with the President,

08:48.120 --> 08:49.640
cast the deciding vote.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.240
Through the nuclear shenanigans,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.800
it's become much easier for the President's nominee

08:53.800 --> 08:55.640
to get permanently on the bench.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.320
And now the confirmation of the Senate the Constitution requires

08:59.320 --> 09:03.080
can literally mean exactly half of the Senators disapprove.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.440
Again, rules lawyering or shenanigans is a matter of opinion.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.360
But shenanigans beget shenanigans,

09:08.360 --> 09:11.720
and there are more nuclear options still just waiting to be picked up.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.080
For example, imagine the President and Senate get a justice on the court

09:15.080 --> 09:17.880
and then later a government of a different color is elected.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.560
Because justices serve for life,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.520
there's nothing the executive and legislative branches can do

09:22.520 --> 09:24.840
until the justice dies or resigns.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.520
Or is there?

09:26.520 --> 09:29.080
Oh, what's this? Judicial impeachment?

09:29.080 --> 09:30.840
I didn't know that was an option.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.480
It is.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.640
Surprise! Congress can impeach and remove Supreme Court justices.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.720
Now, this has never happened fully.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.520
There was one impeachment hearing of a Supreme Court justice

09:40.520 --> 09:42.200
back at the start of the 1800s,

09:42.200 --> 09:44.200
but the vote to convict didn't pass.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.880
The whole incident set the precedent

09:45.880 --> 09:48.920
that the Supreme Court should be left out of partisan politics

09:48.920 --> 09:51.800
and justices shouldn't be removed for political advantage.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.720
But precedents aren't laws,

09:53.720 --> 09:56.280
and this incident did leave a little unclear

09:56.280 --> 09:58.520
what the reasons to impeach could be.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.320
So that nuclear option is lying around.

10:01.320 --> 10:05.560
Another technically possible nuclear shenanigans is forced recess.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.240
The Constitution does have this power

10:07.240 --> 10:09.720
where the President can quote from time to time

10:09.720 --> 10:11.560
force the Congress back to the Capitol,

10:11.560 --> 10:14.200
presumably to sort out some emergency business,

10:14.200 --> 10:15.800
like in a war or a pandemic,

10:15.800 --> 10:18.120
and then can forcibly dismiss them when done.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.040
Now, the exact clause has this weird detail

10:20.040 --> 10:21.960
that if the Senate and House don't agree

10:21.960 --> 10:25.320
on how long the recess will be, the President gets to decide.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.560
So if the Congress was on recess,

10:27.560 --> 10:30.920
and if the President called them back to then immediately dismiss them,

10:30.920 --> 10:34.200
and if the Houses disagreed on how long the recess would be,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.520
then the President could force a long recess

10:36.520 --> 10:39.400
and make recess appointments till their hearts content.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.000
It shouldn't take much imagination

10:41.000 --> 10:44.280
to see why the forced dismissal of Congress by the President

10:44.280 --> 10:46.520
would be the most truly of nuclear shenanigans

10:46.520 --> 10:49.720
and the fallout would affect, like, every part of the government.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.720
But that's the sort of thing that can happen

10:51.720 --> 10:53.960
when shenanigans infinitely escalate.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.000
And given the supreme importance of the Supreme Court,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.960
doubtless the rules lawyers are always looking for more.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.840
Two recurring nukes being either trying to get term limits

11:02.840 --> 11:04.120
on the Supreme Court justices,

11:04.120 --> 11:05.880
but only when it's politically advantageous

11:05.880 --> 11:08.440
and also to make the justices more politically influenceable,

11:08.440 --> 11:11.640
or failing that, simply packing the court with more.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.560
But of course, if and when any possible nuclear shenanigans triggered,

11:15.560 --> 11:18.200
doubtless the Supreme Court will instantly get involved

11:18.200 --> 11:19.640
to make the final call.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.280
And if their earlier decisions are anything to go by,

11:22.280 --> 11:24.520
don't bet a lot of money on the court deciding

11:24.520 --> 11:26.840
to make it easier to mess with the court.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.880
But who knows?

11:27.880 --> 11:31.640
In the meantime, the current possible process is pretty straightforward.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.880
The Senate never goes on recess officially,

11:33.880 --> 11:36.600
so when a seat opens, the President picks a nominee

11:36.600 --> 11:39.800
and half or more of the Senate must confirm that nominee

11:39.800 --> 11:41.800
to the highest court of the land.
