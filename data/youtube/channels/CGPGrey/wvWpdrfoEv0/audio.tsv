0	5000	The main video is talking about a genetic breeding model of how to make machines learn.
5000	8800	This method is simpler to explain or just show.
8800	13100	Here's a machine learning to walk or play Mario or jump real high.
13100	16600	A genetic code is an older code but it still checks out
16600	22900	and I personally suspect in the future genetic models will have a resurgence as compute power approaches crazy paths.
22900	27200	However, the current hotness is deep learning and recursive neural networks
27200	33600	and that's where the linear algebra really increases and explainability in a brief video really decreases.
33600	39500	But if I had to kind of explain how they work in a footnote just for the record, it's like this.
39500	42200	No infinite warehouse, just one student.
42200	46600	TeacherBot has the same test but this time BuilderBot is Dial Adjustment Bot
46600	51600	where each dial is how sensitive one connection in the student bot's head is.
51600	55600	There's a lot of connections in its head so a lot of dials.
55600	56900	A lot a lot.
56900	62400	TeacherBot shows StudentBot a photo and Dial Adjustment Bot adjusts that dial stronger or weaker
62400	65100	to get StudentBot closer to the answer.
65100	67500	It's a bit like adjusting the dial on a radio.
67500	70500	Is that still a thing? Do cars have radios still?
70500	74100	I don't know. Anyway, you might not know the exact frequency of the station
74100	77500	but you can tell if you're getting closer or further away.
77500	82400	It's like that but with a hundred thousand dials and a lot of math.
82400	84800	And that's just for one test question.
84800	89900	When TeacherBot introduces the next photo, Dial Adjustment Bot needs to adjust all the dials
89900	93000	so that StudentBot can answer both questions.
93000	100000	As the test gets longer, this becomes an insane amount of math and fine-tuning for Dial Adjustment Bot.
100000	106500	But when it's done, there's a StudentBot who can do a pretty good job at recognizing new photos
106500	110500	though still suffers from some of the problems mentioned in the main video.
110600	115900	Anyway, that's the most baby's first introduction to neural networks you will ever hear.
115900	121500	If it sounds interesting to you and you like math and code, go dig into the details.
121500	124700	Machines that learn are the future of everything.
124700	128000	Maybe quite literally the future of everything.
128000	132600	And given what we put them through, may the bots have mercy on us all.
140500	142500	Thank you for watching!
