The main video is talking about a genetic breeding model of how to make machines learn.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.800
This method is simpler to explain or just show.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.100
Here's a machine learning to walk or play Mario or jump real high.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.600
A genetic code is an older code but it still checks out

00:16.600 --> 00:22.900
and I personally suspect in the future genetic models will have a resurgence as compute power approaches crazy paths.

00:22.900 --> 00:27.200
However, the current hotness is deep learning and recursive neural networks

00:27.200 --> 00:33.600
and that's where the linear algebra really increases and explainability in a brief video really decreases.

00:33.600 --> 00:39.500
But if I had to kind of explain how they work in a footnote just for the record, it's like this.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.200
No infinite warehouse, just one student.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.600
TeacherBot has the same test but this time BuilderBot is Dial Adjustment Bot

00:46.600 --> 00:51.600
where each dial is how sensitive one connection in the student bot's head is.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.600
There's a lot of connections in its head so a lot of dials.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.900
A lot a lot.

00:56.900 --> 01:02.400
TeacherBot shows StudentBot a photo and Dial Adjustment Bot adjusts that dial stronger or weaker

01:02.400 --> 01:05.100
to get StudentBot closer to the answer.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.500
It's a bit like adjusting the dial on a radio.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.500
Is that still a thing? Do cars have radios still?

01:10.500 --> 01:14.100
I don't know. Anyway, you might not know the exact frequency of the station

01:14.100 --> 01:17.500
but you can tell if you're getting closer or further away.

01:17.500 --> 01:22.400
It's like that but with a hundred thousand dials and a lot of math.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.800
And that's just for one test question.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.900
When TeacherBot introduces the next photo, Dial Adjustment Bot needs to adjust all the dials

01:29.900 --> 01:33.000
so that StudentBot can answer both questions.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
As the test gets longer, this becomes an insane amount of math and fine-tuning for Dial Adjustment Bot.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.500
But when it's done, there's a StudentBot who can do a pretty good job at recognizing new photos

01:46.500 --> 01:50.500
though still suffers from some of the problems mentioned in the main video.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.900
Anyway, that's the most baby's first introduction to neural networks you will ever hear.

01:55.900 --> 02:01.500
If it sounds interesting to you and you like math and code, go dig into the details.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.700
Machines that learn are the future of everything.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.000
Maybe quite literally the future of everything.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.600
And given what we put them through, may the bots have mercy on us all.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.500
Thank you for watching!
