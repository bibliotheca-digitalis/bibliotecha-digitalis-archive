00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The main video is talking about a genetic breeding model of how to make machines learn.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,800
This method is simpler to explain or just show.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,100
Here's a machine learning to walk or play Mario or jump real high.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,600
A genetic code is an older code but it still checks out

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,900
and I personally suspect in the future genetic models will have a resurgence as compute power approaches crazy paths.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,200
However, the current hotness is deep learning and recursive neural networks

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,600
and that's where the linear algebra really increases and explainability in a brief video really decreases.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,500
But if I had to kind of explain how they work in a footnote just for the record, it's like this.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,200
No infinite warehouse, just one student.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,600
TeacherBot has the same test but this time BuilderBot is Dial Adjustment Bot

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,600
where each dial is how sensitive one connection in the student bot's head is.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,600
There's a lot of connections in its head so a lot of dials.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,900
A lot a lot.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,400
TeacherBot shows StudentBot a photo and Dial Adjustment Bot adjusts that dial stronger or weaker

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,100
to get StudentBot closer to the answer.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,500
It's a bit like adjusting the dial on a radio.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Is that still a thing? Do cars have radios still?

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,100
I don't know. Anyway, you might not know the exact frequency of the station

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,500
but you can tell if you're getting closer or further away.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,400
It's like that but with a hundred thousand dials and a lot of math.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,800
And that's just for one test question.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,900
When TeacherBot introduces the next photo, Dial Adjustment Bot needs to adjust all the dials

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,000
so that StudentBot can answer both questions.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As the test gets longer, this becomes an insane amount of math and fine-tuning for Dial Adjustment Bot.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,500
But when it's done, there's a StudentBot who can do a pretty good job at recognizing new photos

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
though still suffers from some of the problems mentioned in the main video.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,900
Anyway, that's the most baby's first introduction to neural networks you will ever hear.

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,500
If it sounds interesting to you and you like math and code, go dig into the details.

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,700
Machines that learn are the future of everything.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,000
Maybe quite literally the future of everything.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,600
And given what we put them through, may the bots have mercy on us all.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Thank you for watching!
