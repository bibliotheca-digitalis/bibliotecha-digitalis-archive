0	5520	Hello internet. The channel has just chugged past 900 million views.
5520	10320	The next stop is The Big Billion, which is a little bitâ€¦ wow.
10320	12640	I'd like to have a Q&A ready for that day,
12640	18240	which realistically means I need to get started right now by asking you for your questions.
18240	20880	Please send them NOT via the comments below.
20880	27360	In fact, let me just close the entrance to that howling mine and direct you rather to the Reddit.
27360	32560	Because Reddit has a great random question secret voting system that helps me sort through it all,
32560	35920	and last time the number of questions crossed 12,000.
37280	40080	Even if you don't have a question, please do consider voting.
40080	44480	A single upvote can rocket a question above thousands of others ignored,
44480	49040	and a single downvote damns a question into eternal oblivion.
49040	49600	Very helpful.
50480	51440	Yeah, so that's it.
51440	55360	You can check out the previous Q&As over here to see what's already been covered,
55360	57680	and then click here to head over to Reddit.
57680	61920	Thank you for submitting questions and voting, and I'll see you at a billion.
66320	72000	Well, I probably won't be ready exactly on time, but you guys know the deal by now.
