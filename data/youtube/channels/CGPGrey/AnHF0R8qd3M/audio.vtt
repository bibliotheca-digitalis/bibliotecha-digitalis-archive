Hello internet. The channel has just chugged past 900 million views.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
The next stop is The Big Billion, which is a little bitâ€¦ wow.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.640
I'd like to have a Q&A ready for that day,

00:12.640 --> 00:18.240
which realistically means I need to get started right now by asking you for your questions.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.880
Please send them NOT via the comments below.

00:20.880 --> 00:27.360
In fact, let me just close the entrance to that howling mine and direct you rather to the Reddit.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.560
Because Reddit has a great random question secret voting system that helps me sort through it all,

00:32.560 --> 00:35.920
and last time the number of questions crossed 12,000.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.080
Even if you don't have a question, please do consider voting.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.480
A single upvote can rocket a question above thousands of others ignored,

00:44.480 --> 00:49.040
and a single downvote damns a question into eternal oblivion.

00:49.040 --> 00:49.600
Very helpful.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.440
Yeah, so that's it.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.360
You can check out the previous Q&As over here to see what's already been covered,

00:55.360 --> 00:57.680
and then click here to head over to Reddit.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.920
Thank you for submitting questions and voting, and I'll see you at a billion.

01:06.320 --> 01:12.000
Well, I probably won't be ready exactly on time, but you guys know the deal by now.
