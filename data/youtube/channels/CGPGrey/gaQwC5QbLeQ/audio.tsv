0	2520	Poor, no-flag Northern Ireland.
2520	6700	While England, Scotland and Wales all have flags, as countries in the United Kingdom,
6700	7700	not her.
7700	11600	But rather than a transparent skirt of technical correctness, which would be weird, bam, these
11600	16720	videos use this flag, that's often used to represent Northern Ireland in the real world.
16720	19480	If it's good enough for sports, it's good enough for skorts.
19480	23760	But why isn't this flag official, and why do some people prefer not to use it?
23760	28080	To discuss this, we must follow a narrow path through the forest of all knowledge, and be
28080	29660	careful not to stray.
29660	33580	It's easy to get lost in these woods, for there are always distractions and dangers
33580	35260	to pull us aside.
35260	37660	Focus on the flag, don't leave the path.
37660	41940	This flag is the Ulster Banner, named after Ulster, one of Ireland's traditional regions.
41940	46280	The flag first flew above the Northern Irish Parliament in 1953, as part of a visit by
46280	48180	the then-newly coordinated Queen.
48180	50940	But straight away, there was a bit of an asterisk, as, quote,
50940	54100	The Minister of Home Affairs announced that while the Union flag was the only officially
54100	57740	recognised standard, those who wish to have a distinctive Ulster symbol might use the
57740	58740	banner.
58820	61060	Here's your new flag, but not really.
61060	66120	And the new flag wasn't new either, designed in 1923, along with the Ulster coat of arms.
66120	69100	Coat of arms are symbolic objects, so let's talk about the parts.
69100	73540	The Irish Elk represents the local Irish, and the Red Lion represents the Ulster Scots.
73540	76760	Wait, why are there so many Scottish people in Northern Ireland to warrant half the coat
76760	77760	of arms?
77760	79220	Have we wandered off the path?
79220	83140	The shield design is a red cross, which is totally not at all the St. George Cross England
83140	88620	uses, plus the crown of the UK and this red hand, which is a defining Northern Irish element,
88620	92100	as it's unique, unlike the crown and the cross, which are on everything.
92100	95840	The hand comes with a Lady Godiva-style story about how the first to touch the land of Ulster
95840	96840	would own it.
96840	100660	So, of course, in the race, someone cut off his own hand to win on technicality.
100660	102620	Which can't possibly be true.
102620	106340	Not because people haven't been yelling first, technically, since the dawn of time.
106340	108660	But because, one, have you ever tried to cut off your own hand?
108660	109960	It's a lot harder than it sounds.
109960	113560	And two, while several important Northern Irish families claim creation of the hand,
113560	117820	the stories go back to the 13th century, where the paper trail runs cold.
117820	121560	So let's spin the wheel of historical claims and just say it was the O'Neills, because
121560	124720	they're the easiest ones to pronounce and they're going to show up briefly later.
124720	128260	From creation until now, there's been debate about if the hand switched from a sinister
128260	130860	version—no seriously, that's what you're supposed to call the lefty version—to a
130860	131860	righty version.
131860	135000	But any flip-flop might just have been the whimsy of individual flag makers.
135000	137280	Same with the thumb position, which is all over the place.
137280	141660	There wasn't exactly a vexagological standards board a thousand years ago keeping consistency.
141660	146460	Anyway, sometime after the 1300s, the hand of the... O'Neills was added to the symbol
146460	150340	of another important Northern Irish family, a red cross on a yellow background, to form
150340	151740	the Ulster coat of arms.
151740	155540	Oh, it really isn't the St. George Cross, earlier sarcastic remark with John.
155540	160620	The designer of the new arms and flag 400 years later changed the color for reasons
160620	161620	no one knows.
161620	166380	The flag was then modified with a crown and a star and made sort of official from 1953
166380	170700	all the way until 1973, when the Northern Irish Parliament ceased to exist during the
170700	179540	Troubles.
179540	185200	The Troubles were—are—an irregular conflict around Northern Ireland.
185200	188420	Is she part of Ireland, or is she part of the United Kingdom?
188420	194180	The dispute started when Great Britain colonized Northern Ireland, confiscating the land from
194180	199020	local families such as the O'Neills, with the goal to, quote, pacify, civilize, and
199020	203220	develop the land, redistributing it to English and lots of Scottish settlers.
203220	205580	Oh, that's why the lion's there.
205580	212300	So just like other places Great Britain colonized, there's a modern muddle of ownership and identity.
212300	216320	In these islands, the conflict spilled across them for so long that it's represented in
216320	220060	Ireland's flag, with the white stripe being the hope for peace.
220060	221060	Huh.
221060	225300	Ireland's flag still uses the 2-1 ratio of former UK places rather than the more common
225300	226980	3-2 ratio of most flags.
226980	227980	Interesting.
227980	231620	The US is a former UK place, but it goes with a 10-19 ratio.
231620	232620	Very unusual.
232620	235160	Ah, we got pulled off the path.
235160	236160	We need to get out of here.
236160	239740	So though the flag is composed of traditional Northern Irish symbols—mostly—it's not
239740	245700	official because it never really was 100%, and the government that used it doesn't exist.
245700	249120	And when the most divisive issue in your land is should it be part of a kingdom, having
249120	254260	a crown on your flag isn't exactly neutral, and is also why there are periodic calls for
254260	256300	a new Northern Irish flag.
256380	260400	But the power of flags is less about if they're official or not, and much more about do people
260400	263000	use them and do other people recognize them.
263000	267360	And within these fair isles, it's fair to say that, at least currently, the flag is
267360	268860	used and recognized.
