1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Poor, no-flag Northern Ireland.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,700
While England, Scotland and Wales all have flags, as countries in the United Kingdom,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,700
not her.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,600
But rather than a transparent skirt of technical correctness, which would be weird, bam, these

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,720
videos use this flag, that's often used to represent Northern Ireland in the real world.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,480
If it's good enough for sports, it's good enough for skorts.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,760
But why isn't this flag official, and why do some people prefer not to use it?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
To discuss this, we must follow a narrow path through the forest of all knowledge, and be

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,660
careful not to stray.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,580
It's easy to get lost in these woods, for there are always distractions and dangers

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,260
to pull us aside.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,660
Focus on the flag, don't leave the path.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,940
This flag is the Ulster Banner, named after Ulster, one of Ireland's traditional regions.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,280
The flag first flew above the Northern Irish Parliament in 1953, as part of a visit by

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,180
the then-newly coordinated Queen.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,940
But straight away, there was a bit of an asterisk, as, quote,

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,100
The Minister of Home Affairs announced that while the Union flag was the only officially

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,740
recognised standard, those who wish to have a distinctive Ulster symbol might use the

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,740
banner.

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,060
Here's your new flag, but not really.

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,120
And the new flag wasn't new either, designed in 1923, along with the Ulster coat of arms.

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,100
Coat of arms are symbolic objects, so let's talk about the parts.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,540
The Irish Elk represents the local Irish, and the Red Lion represents the Ulster Scots.

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,760
Wait, why are there so many Scottish people in Northern Ireland to warrant half the coat

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
of arms?

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,220
Have we wandered off the path?

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,140
The shield design is a red cross, which is totally not at all the St. George Cross England

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,620
uses, plus the crown of the UK and this red hand, which is a defining Northern Irish element,

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,100
as it's unique, unlike the crown and the cross, which are on everything.

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,840
The hand comes with a Lady Godiva-style story about how the first to touch the land of Ulster

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
would own it.

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,660
So, of course, in the race, someone cut off his own hand to win on technicality.

33
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,620
Which can't possibly be true.

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,340
Not because people haven't been yelling first, technically, since the dawn of time.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,660
But because, one, have you ever tried to cut off your own hand?

36
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,960
It's a lot harder than it sounds.

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,560
And two, while several important Northern Irish families claim creation of the hand,

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,820
the stories go back to the 13th century, where the paper trail runs cold.

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,560
So let's spin the wheel of historical claims and just say it was the O'Neills, because

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,720
they're the easiest ones to pronounce and they're going to show up briefly later.

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,260
From creation until now, there's been debate about if the hand switched from a sinister

42
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,860
version—no seriously, that's what you're supposed to call the lefty version—to a

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
righty version.

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,000
But any flip-flop might just have been the whimsy of individual flag makers.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
Same with the thumb position, which is all over the place.

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,660
There wasn't exactly a vexagological standards board a thousand years ago keeping consistency.

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,460
Anyway, sometime after the 1300s, the hand of the... O'Neills was added to the symbol

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,340
of another important Northern Irish family, a red cross on a yellow background, to form

49
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,740
the Ulster coat of arms.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,540
Oh, it really isn't the St. George Cross, earlier sarcastic remark with John.

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,620
The designer of the new arms and flag 400 years later changed the color for reasons

52
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
no one knows.

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,380
The flag was then modified with a crown and a star and made sort of official from 1953

54
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,700
all the way until 1973, when the Northern Irish Parliament ceased to exist during the

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Troubles.

56
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,200
The Troubles were—are—an irregular conflict around Northern Ireland.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,420
Is she part of Ireland, or is she part of the United Kingdom?

58
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,180
The dispute started when Great Britain colonized Northern Ireland, confiscating the land from

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,020
local families such as the O'Neills, with the goal to, quote, pacify, civilize, and

60
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,220
develop the land, redistributing it to English and lots of Scottish settlers.

61
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,580
Oh, that's why the lion's there.

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,300
So just like other places Great Britain colonized, there's a modern muddle of ownership and identity.

63
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,320
In these islands, the conflict spilled across them for so long that it's represented in

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,060
Ireland's flag, with the white stripe being the hope for peace.

65
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Huh.

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,300
Ireland's flag still uses the 2-1 ratio of former UK places rather than the more common

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,980
3-2 ratio of most flags.

68
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Interesting.

69
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,620
The US is a former UK place, but it goes with a 10-19 ratio.

70
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
Very unusual.

71
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,160
Ah, we got pulled off the path.

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
We need to get out of here.

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,740
So though the flag is composed of traditional Northern Irish symbols—mostly—it's not

74
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,700
official because it never really was 100%, and the government that used it doesn't exist.

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,120
And when the most divisive issue in your land is should it be part of a kingdom, having

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,260
a crown on your flag isn't exactly neutral, and is also why there are periodic calls for

77
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,300
a new Northern Irish flag.

78
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,400
But the power of flags is less about if they're official or not, and much more about do people

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,000
use them and do other people recognize them.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,360
And within these fair isles, it's fair to say that, at least currently, the flag is

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,860
used and recognized.
