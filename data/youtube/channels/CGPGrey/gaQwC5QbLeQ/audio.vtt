00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
Poor, no-flag Northern Ireland.

00:02.520 --> 00:06.700
While England, Scotland and Wales all have flags, as countries in the United Kingdom,

00:06.700 --> 00:07.700
not her.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.600
But rather than a transparent skirt of technical correctness, which would be weird, bam, these

00:11.600 --> 00:16.720
videos use this flag, that's often used to represent Northern Ireland in the real world.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.480
If it's good enough for sports, it's good enough for skorts.

00:19.480 --> 00:23.760
But why isn't this flag official, and why do some people prefer not to use it?

00:23.760 --> 00:28.080
To discuss this, we must follow a narrow path through the forest of all knowledge, and be

00:28.080 --> 00:29.660
careful not to stray.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.580
It's easy to get lost in these woods, for there are always distractions and dangers

00:33.580 --> 00:35.260
to pull us aside.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.660
Focus on the flag, don't leave the path.

00:37.660 --> 00:41.940
This flag is the Ulster Banner, named after Ulster, one of Ireland's traditional regions.

00:41.940 --> 00:46.280
The flag first flew above the Northern Irish Parliament in 1953, as part of a visit by

00:46.280 --> 00:48.180
the then-newly coordinated Queen.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.940
But straight away, there was a bit of an asterisk, as, quote,

00:50.940 --> 00:54.100
The Minister of Home Affairs announced that while the Union flag was the only officially

00:54.100 --> 00:57.740
recognised standard, those who wish to have a distinctive Ulster symbol might use the

00:57.740 --> 00:58.740
banner.

00:58.820 --> 01:01.060
Here's your new flag, but not really.

01:01.060 --> 01:06.120
And the new flag wasn't new either, designed in 1923, along with the Ulster coat of arms.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.100
Coat of arms are symbolic objects, so let's talk about the parts.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.540
The Irish Elk represents the local Irish, and the Red Lion represents the Ulster Scots.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.760
Wait, why are there so many Scottish people in Northern Ireland to warrant half the coat

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
of arms?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.220
Have we wandered off the path?

01:19.220 --> 01:23.140
The shield design is a red cross, which is totally not at all the St. George Cross England

01:23.140 --> 01:28.620
uses, plus the crown of the UK and this red hand, which is a defining Northern Irish element,

01:28.620 --> 01:32.100
as it's unique, unlike the crown and the cross, which are on everything.

01:32.100 --> 01:35.840
The hand comes with a Lady Godiva-style story about how the first to touch the land of Ulster

01:35.840 --> 01:36.840
would own it.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.660
So, of course, in the race, someone cut off his own hand to win on technicality.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.620
Which can't possibly be true.

01:42.620 --> 01:46.340
Not because people haven't been yelling first, technically, since the dawn of time.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.660
But because, one, have you ever tried to cut off your own hand?

01:48.660 --> 01:49.960
It's a lot harder than it sounds.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.560
And two, while several important Northern Irish families claim creation of the hand,

01:53.560 --> 01:57.820
the stories go back to the 13th century, where the paper trail runs cold.

01:57.820 --> 02:01.560
So let's spin the wheel of historical claims and just say it was the O'Neills, because

02:01.560 --> 02:04.720
they're the easiest ones to pronounce and they're going to show up briefly later.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.260
From creation until now, there's been debate about if the hand switched from a sinister

02:08.260 --> 02:10.860
version—no seriously, that's what you're supposed to call the lefty version—to a

02:10.860 --> 02:11.860
righty version.

02:11.860 --> 02:15.000
But any flip-flop might just have been the whimsy of individual flag makers.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.280
Same with the thumb position, which is all over the place.

02:17.280 --> 02:21.660
There wasn't exactly a vexagological standards board a thousand years ago keeping consistency.

02:21.660 --> 02:26.460
Anyway, sometime after the 1300s, the hand of the... O'Neills was added to the symbol

02:26.460 --> 02:30.340
of another important Northern Irish family, a red cross on a yellow background, to form

02:30.340 --> 02:31.740
the Ulster coat of arms.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.540
Oh, it really isn't the St. George Cross, earlier sarcastic remark with John.

02:35.540 --> 02:40.620
The designer of the new arms and flag 400 years later changed the color for reasons

02:40.620 --> 02:41.620
no one knows.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.380
The flag was then modified with a crown and a star and made sort of official from 1953

02:46.380 --> 02:50.700
all the way until 1973, when the Northern Irish Parliament ceased to exist during the

02:50.700 --> 02:59.540
Troubles.

02:59.540 --> 03:05.200
The Troubles were—are—an irregular conflict around Northern Ireland.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.420
Is she part of Ireland, or is she part of the United Kingdom?

03:08.420 --> 03:14.180
The dispute started when Great Britain colonized Northern Ireland, confiscating the land from

03:14.180 --> 03:19.020
local families such as the O'Neills, with the goal to, quote, pacify, civilize, and

03:19.020 --> 03:23.220
develop the land, redistributing it to English and lots of Scottish settlers.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.580
Oh, that's why the lion's there.

03:25.580 --> 03:32.300
So just like other places Great Britain colonized, there's a modern muddle of ownership and identity.

03:32.300 --> 03:36.320
In these islands, the conflict spilled across them for so long that it's represented in

03:36.320 --> 03:40.060
Ireland's flag, with the white stripe being the hope for peace.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.060
Huh.

03:41.060 --> 03:45.300
Ireland's flag still uses the 2-1 ratio of former UK places rather than the more common

03:45.300 --> 03:46.980
3-2 ratio of most flags.

03:46.980 --> 03:47.980
Interesting.

03:47.980 --> 03:51.620
The US is a former UK place, but it goes with a 10-19 ratio.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.620
Very unusual.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.160
Ah, we got pulled off the path.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
We need to get out of here.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.740
So though the flag is composed of traditional Northern Irish symbols—mostly—it's not

03:59.740 --> 04:05.700
official because it never really was 100%, and the government that used it doesn't exist.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.120
And when the most divisive issue in your land is should it be part of a kingdom, having

04:09.120 --> 04:14.260
a crown on your flag isn't exactly neutral, and is also why there are periodic calls for

04:14.260 --> 04:16.300
a new Northern Irish flag.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.400
But the power of flags is less about if they're official or not, and much more about do people

04:20.400 --> 04:23.000
use them and do other people recognize them.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.360
And within these fair isles, it's fair to say that, at least currently, the flag is

04:27.360 --> 04:28.860
used and recognized.
