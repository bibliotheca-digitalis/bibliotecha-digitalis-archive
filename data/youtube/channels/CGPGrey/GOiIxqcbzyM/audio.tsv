0	5360	Hello, Internet. Well, here we are. 500,000 subscribers. Well, actually, by the time I
5360	9240	finish this video it's a bit more than that, but who knew after I promised to do a Q&A
9240	13020	that the Pope would resign? Anyway, when I uploaded my first explanation video just over
13020	17360	two years ago now, I would never have expected this. More than half a million subscribers
17360	22160	and 16 videos with more than a million views? Who knew rapidly spoken educational videos
22160	26500	could be so popular? Thank you, Internet. Now, as promised, though slightly behind schedule,
26500	30020	it's time to answer some of your questions. What's your educational background? I went
30020	33960	to school in New York where I earned two college degrees, one in physics and one in sociology.
33960	37520	After that I moved to London and earned a PGCE in science education and became qualified
37520	41000	as a physics teacher in England. How long does it take to create a video? I've tracked
41000	45460	my time to get an accurate answer and every minute of final video you see takes me between
45460	50140	10 and 20 hours of writing and animating to make. So a typical 5 minute video represents
50140	54540	50 to 100 hours of work. While that's a lot, it doesn't include the research phase which
54540	58200	is difficult to quantify. Some of the videos I've made I've been collecting notes on for
58200	62320	more than a year before starting. What was your favorite video to make? The 2012 video
62320	66300	was the most fun by far mainly because I didn't have to do a lot of complicated research and
66300	69820	I got to complain about things that I don't like. What change would you make to the education
69820	73920	system? Instead of grouping kids by age, I'd try grouping them by ability instead. The
73920	78180	idea that just because a kid is 14 years old they're ready for trigonometry is weird. No
78180	82520	other part of human society organizes itself this way and for good reason. It artificially
82520	85680	slows down the best and the brightest. What do you think should be in the curriculum
85680	89260	but isn't? Computer programming. I was kind of shocked and horrified when I started teaching
89260	93200	in the UK to discover that there were no real computer programming lessons. Of course there
93200	96740	are only so many classes in a day and everybody wants their pet subject taught in school so
96740	100540	the equally important question is what to get rid of to make room for computer programming
100540	104640	and without the slightest hesitation I ditched the foreign language classes. After all computer
104640	108640	programming is getting us closer and closer to a universal translator anyway. What do
108640	112300	you do when you receive pennies? I die a little inside thinking about how political systems
112300	116300	can distribute tiny costs across a large number of people to the benefit of a few. What's
116300	119800	your favorite element? I don't have a favorite but I'm irrationally fond of tungsten mainly
119800	123600	because my wedding ring is made out of it. What's the story behind your logo? It's basically
123600	127120	a personal flag for my love of science and technology. When I first started this channel
127120	130840	I thought I would make more videos about those two things but for various reasons that hasn't
130840	135280	happened yet and besides it's not like there's a shortage of good science channels on YouTube.
135280	139720	By the way if you really like the logo you can get it on t-shirts and now coffee mugs
139720	143600	which is particularly appropriate as coffee is the fuel that without which these videos
143600	147280	could not be made. What do you do in your free time? I like to horseback ride through
147280	151280	the mountains. Nah it's mostly just reddit. Speaking of which... Would you rather fight
151280	155400	100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? One horse sized duck. The cube square law
155400	159240	means that the legs of a horse sized duck probably wouldn't be structurally sound. Easy
159240	163240	fight. Are there going to be more politics in the animal kingdom videos? Yes I'm sorry
163240	166800	I know this playlist is unfinished and if any of the videos I've ever made can be said
166800	170620	to be important it's these. I promise at least one more about the single transferable
170620	174360	vote but I don't make any promises about when that will happen. Do you think third parties
174360	178640	will ever gain ground in the United States? No. The problem isn't politics or voter apathy
178640	182840	it's the system that creates the politics and voter apathy. The US election system is
182840	186900	pretty much the worst in the civilized world. Often voting for a third party isn't just
186900	191680	a waste it's also a vote against your own best interests. Third parties really can't
191680	195600	thrive under those conditions. What's one technology you wish to see before you die?
195600	199400	Mortality technology. Where do you get your ideas? It's been my experience that creative
199400	202700	projects are self-sustaining. The more you write the more things you want to write about
202700	207280	and the more you program the more programming ideas you have. For me each video spawns more
207280	210440	videos. The daylight savings one for example originally contained spots for information
210440	214180	about longitude and time zones and the seasons that all got cut but will probably become
214180	219320	their own videos at some point. Also I listened to a monstrous number of audio books and podcasts
219320	222660	if you're interested you can see some of my favorites here. These help keep me in touch
222660	226280	with the wider world and expose me to ideas and information that I wouldn't have come
226280	230540	across on my own. If you could live at any time in history when would it be? I wouldn't.
230540	234500	Allow me to summarize all of human existence with this single graph. What's the best way
234500	239000	to be successful on YouTube? Make videos people want to watch? I'm not trying to be glib here
239000	242960	but when asked this question I see many YouTubers talk about the importance of upload schedules
242960	248380	and managing your social media and collaborations and my experience says that's completely backwards.
248380	252340	If your videos aren't interesting no one will care if you upload them regularly and Twitter
252340	256680	followers don't get you views views get you Twitter followers and people who want to collaborate
256680	261420	with you. I know it's not very helpful advice but it's the most truthful advice I can give.
261420	264200	What's the most interesting fact you've ever been told? It's difficult to pick just one
264200	267960	from an entire lifetime but last year Veritasium visited me in London and walked me through
267960	271620	the process by which trees get water from their roots to their leaves. That sounds really
271620	275660	boring but it was one of the most mind-blowing conversations I've had in a long time. How
275660	279460	often do you engage with professionals while you research? For me being confused and frustrated
279460	283020	with the topic is a vital part of figuring out how to explain it to others so I'd say
283020	288340	95% of research I do on my own. If I'm really out of depth on my topic like the debt video
288340	292140	and the pope video I try very hard to find an expert to look over the final draft of
292140	297100	my script but time constraints and finding trustworthy experts is sometimes a bit difficult.
297100	301040	What's your favorite internal organ? The brain because it's the one that's me. Is there any
301040	304800	part of science you want to be proven wrong? Yes the current interpretations of the ultimate
304800	309360	fate of the universe all make me sad. Can you answer 10 questions in under 30 seconds?
309360	312680	What is your favorite scientific study ever published? Unskilled and unaware further explorations
312680	316920	of absent self-interest among the incompetent. Link in the description. Hogwarts house? Ravenclaw
316920	321240	I'd hope. Celsius or Fahrenheit? Fahrenheit. Kirk or Picard? Picard. Do you wear glasses?
321240	325160	Uh yeah. Favorite empire? The second one. Those monks were awesome. How can a country
325160	328920	be totally self-sufficient as in no imports or exports? Simple resort to a medieval level
328920	332760	of technology. Favorite sport? No. Should science play a bigger role in politics? What
332760	335760	you mean the method by which we determine the truth? Yeah I think it should. Can you
335760	339680	answer 10 questions in under 30 seconds? Apparently. Alright thanks to everyone who
339680	341680	submitted questions. It's been fun, Internet.
