Hello, Internet. Well, here we are. 500,000 subscribers. Well, actually, by the time I

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,240
finish this video it's a bit more than that, but who knew after I promised to do a Q&A

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,020
that the Pope would resign? Anyway, when I uploaded my first explanation video just over

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,360
two years ago now, I would never have expected this. More than half a million subscribers

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,160
and 16 videos with more than a million views? Who knew rapidly spoken educational videos

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,500
could be so popular? Thank you, Internet. Now, as promised, though slightly behind schedule,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,020
it's time to answer some of your questions. What's your educational background? I went

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,960
to school in New York where I earned two college degrees, one in physics and one in sociology.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,520
After that I moved to London and earned a PGCE in science education and became qualified

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,000
as a physics teacher in England. How long does it take to create a video? I've tracked

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,460
my time to get an accurate answer and every minute of final video you see takes me between

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,140
10 and 20 hours of writing and animating to make. So a typical 5 minute video represents

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,540
50 to 100 hours of work. While that's a lot, it doesn't include the research phase which

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,200
is difficult to quantify. Some of the videos I've made I've been collecting notes on for

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,320
more than a year before starting. What was your favorite video to make? The 2012 video

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,300
was the most fun by far mainly because I didn't have to do a lot of complicated research and

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,820
I got to complain about things that I don't like. What change would you make to the education

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,920
system? Instead of grouping kids by age, I'd try grouping them by ability instead. The

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,180
idea that just because a kid is 14 years old they're ready for trigonometry is weird. No

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,520
other part of human society organizes itself this way and for good reason. It artificially

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,680
slows down the best and the brightest. What do you think should be in the curriculum

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,260
but isn't? Computer programming. I was kind of shocked and horrified when I started teaching

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,200
in the UK to discover that there were no real computer programming lessons. Of course there

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,740
are only so many classes in a day and everybody wants their pet subject taught in school so

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,540
the equally important question is what to get rid of to make room for computer programming

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,640
and without the slightest hesitation I ditched the foreign language classes. After all computer

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
programming is getting us closer and closer to a universal translator anyway. What do

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,300
you do when you receive pennies? I die a little inside thinking about how political systems

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,300
can distribute tiny costs across a large number of people to the benefit of a few. What's

30
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,800
your favorite element? I don't have a favorite but I'm irrationally fond of tungsten mainly

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,600
because my wedding ring is made out of it. What's the story behind your logo? It's basically

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,120
a personal flag for my love of science and technology. When I first started this channel

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,840
I thought I would make more videos about those two things but for various reasons that hasn't

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,280
happened yet and besides it's not like there's a shortage of good science channels on YouTube.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,720
By the way if you really like the logo you can get it on t-shirts and now coffee mugs

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,600
which is particularly appropriate as coffee is the fuel that without which these videos

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,280
could not be made. What do you do in your free time? I like to horseback ride through

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
the mountains. Nah it's mostly just reddit. Speaking of which... Would you rather fight

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,400
100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? One horse sized duck. The cube square law

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,240
means that the legs of a horse sized duck probably wouldn't be structurally sound. Easy

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,240
fight. Are there going to be more politics in the animal kingdom videos? Yes I'm sorry

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,800
I know this playlist is unfinished and if any of the videos I've ever made can be said

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,620
to be important it's these. I promise at least one more about the single transferable

44
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,360
vote but I don't make any promises about when that will happen. Do you think third parties

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,640
will ever gain ground in the United States? No. The problem isn't politics or voter apathy

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,840
it's the system that creates the politics and voter apathy. The US election system is

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,900
pretty much the worst in the civilized world. Often voting for a third party isn't just

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,680
a waste it's also a vote against your own best interests. Third parties really can't

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,600
thrive under those conditions. What's one technology you wish to see before you die?

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Mortality technology. Where do you get your ideas? It's been my experience that creative

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,700
projects are self-sustaining. The more you write the more things you want to write about

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,280
and the more you program the more programming ideas you have. For me each video spawns more

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,440
videos. The daylight savings one for example originally contained spots for information

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,180
about longitude and time zones and the seasons that all got cut but will probably become

55
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,320
their own videos at some point. Also I listened to a monstrous number of audio books and podcasts

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,660
if you're interested you can see some of my favorites here. These help keep me in touch

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,280
with the wider world and expose me to ideas and information that I wouldn't have come

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,540
across on my own. If you could live at any time in history when would it be? I wouldn't.

59
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,500
Allow me to summarize all of human existence with this single graph. What's the best way

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,000
to be successful on YouTube? Make videos people want to watch? I'm not trying to be glib here

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,960
but when asked this question I see many YouTubers talk about the importance of upload schedules

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,380
and managing your social media and collaborations and my experience says that's completely backwards.

63
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,340
If your videos aren't interesting no one will care if you upload them regularly and Twitter

64
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,680
followers don't get you views views get you Twitter followers and people who want to collaborate

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,420
with you. I know it's not very helpful advice but it's the most truthful advice I can give.

66
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,200
What's the most interesting fact you've ever been told? It's difficult to pick just one

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,960
from an entire lifetime but last year Veritasium visited me in London and walked me through

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,620
the process by which trees get water from their roots to their leaves. That sounds really

69
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,660
boring but it was one of the most mind-blowing conversations I've had in a long time. How

70
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,460
often do you engage with professionals while you research? For me being confused and frustrated

71
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,020
with the topic is a vital part of figuring out how to explain it to others so I'd say

72
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,340
95% of research I do on my own. If I'm really out of depth on my topic like the debt video

73
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,140
and the pope video I try very hard to find an expert to look over the final draft of

74
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,100
my script but time constraints and finding trustworthy experts is sometimes a bit difficult.

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,040
What's your favorite internal organ? The brain because it's the one that's me. Is there any

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,800
part of science you want to be proven wrong? Yes the current interpretations of the ultimate

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
fate of the universe all make me sad. Can you answer 10 questions in under 30 seconds?

78
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,680
What is your favorite scientific study ever published? Unskilled and unaware further explorations

79
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,920
of absent self-interest among the incompetent. Link in the description. Hogwarts house? Ravenclaw

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,240
I'd hope. Celsius or Fahrenheit? Fahrenheit. Kirk or Picard? Picard. Do you wear glasses?

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,160
Uh yeah. Favorite empire? The second one. Those monks were awesome. How can a country

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,920
be totally self-sufficient as in no imports or exports? Simple resort to a medieval level

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,760
of technology. Favorite sport? No. Should science play a bigger role in politics? What

84
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,760
you mean the method by which we determine the truth? Yeah I think it should. Can you

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,680
answer 10 questions in under 30 seconds? Apparently. Alright thanks to everyone who

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
submitted questions. It's been fun, Internet.
