Hello, Internet. Well, here we are. 500,000 subscribers. Well, actually, by the time I

00:05.360 --> 00:09.240
finish this video it's a bit more than that, but who knew after I promised to do a Q&A

00:09.240 --> 00:13.020
that the Pope would resign? Anyway, when I uploaded my first explanation video just over

00:13.020 --> 00:17.360
two years ago now, I would never have expected this. More than half a million subscribers

00:17.360 --> 00:22.160
and 16 videos with more than a million views? Who knew rapidly spoken educational videos

00:22.160 --> 00:26.500
could be so popular? Thank you, Internet. Now, as promised, though slightly behind schedule,

00:26.500 --> 00:30.020
it's time to answer some of your questions. What's your educational background? I went

00:30.020 --> 00:33.960
to school in New York where I earned two college degrees, one in physics and one in sociology.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.520
After that I moved to London and earned a PGCE in science education and became qualified

00:37.520 --> 00:41.000
as a physics teacher in England. How long does it take to create a video? I've tracked

00:41.000 --> 00:45.460
my time to get an accurate answer and every minute of final video you see takes me between

00:45.460 --> 00:50.140
10 and 20 hours of writing and animating to make. So a typical 5 minute video represents

00:50.140 --> 00:54.540
50 to 100 hours of work. While that's a lot, it doesn't include the research phase which

00:54.540 --> 00:58.200
is difficult to quantify. Some of the videos I've made I've been collecting notes on for

00:58.200 --> 01:02.320
more than a year before starting. What was your favorite video to make? The 2012 video

01:02.320 --> 01:06.300
was the most fun by far mainly because I didn't have to do a lot of complicated research and

01:06.300 --> 01:09.820
I got to complain about things that I don't like. What change would you make to the education

01:09.820 --> 01:13.920
system? Instead of grouping kids by age, I'd try grouping them by ability instead. The

01:13.920 --> 01:18.180
idea that just because a kid is 14 years old they're ready for trigonometry is weird. No

01:18.180 --> 01:22.520
other part of human society organizes itself this way and for good reason. It artificially

01:22.520 --> 01:25.680
slows down the best and the brightest. What do you think should be in the curriculum

01:25.680 --> 01:29.260
but isn't? Computer programming. I was kind of shocked and horrified when I started teaching

01:29.260 --> 01:33.200
in the UK to discover that there were no real computer programming lessons. Of course there

01:33.200 --> 01:36.740
are only so many classes in a day and everybody wants their pet subject taught in school so

01:36.740 --> 01:40.540
the equally important question is what to get rid of to make room for computer programming

01:40.540 --> 01:44.640
and without the slightest hesitation I ditched the foreign language classes. After all computer

01:44.640 --> 01:48.640
programming is getting us closer and closer to a universal translator anyway. What do

01:48.640 --> 01:52.300
you do when you receive pennies? I die a little inside thinking about how political systems

01:52.300 --> 01:56.300
can distribute tiny costs across a large number of people to the benefit of a few. What's

01:56.300 --> 01:59.800
your favorite element? I don't have a favorite but I'm irrationally fond of tungsten mainly

01:59.800 --> 02:03.600
because my wedding ring is made out of it. What's the story behind your logo? It's basically

02:03.600 --> 02:07.120
a personal flag for my love of science and technology. When I first started this channel

02:07.120 --> 02:10.840
I thought I would make more videos about those two things but for various reasons that hasn't

02:10.840 --> 02:15.280
happened yet and besides it's not like there's a shortage of good science channels on YouTube.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.720
By the way if you really like the logo you can get it on t-shirts and now coffee mugs

02:19.720 --> 02:23.600
which is particularly appropriate as coffee is the fuel that without which these videos

02:23.600 --> 02:27.280
could not be made. What do you do in your free time? I like to horseback ride through

02:27.280 --> 02:31.280
the mountains. Nah it's mostly just reddit. Speaking of which... Would you rather fight

02:31.280 --> 02:35.400
100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? One horse sized duck. The cube square law

02:35.400 --> 02:39.240
means that the legs of a horse sized duck probably wouldn't be structurally sound. Easy

02:39.240 --> 02:43.240
fight. Are there going to be more politics in the animal kingdom videos? Yes I'm sorry

02:43.240 --> 02:46.800
I know this playlist is unfinished and if any of the videos I've ever made can be said

02:46.800 --> 02:50.620
to be important it's these. I promise at least one more about the single transferable

02:50.620 --> 02:54.360
vote but I don't make any promises about when that will happen. Do you think third parties

02:54.360 --> 02:58.640
will ever gain ground in the United States? No. The problem isn't politics or voter apathy

02:58.640 --> 03:02.840
it's the system that creates the politics and voter apathy. The US election system is

03:02.840 --> 03:06.900
pretty much the worst in the civilized world. Often voting for a third party isn't just

03:06.900 --> 03:11.680
a waste it's also a vote against your own best interests. Third parties really can't

03:11.680 --> 03:15.600
thrive under those conditions. What's one technology you wish to see before you die?

03:15.600 --> 03:19.400
Mortality technology. Where do you get your ideas? It's been my experience that creative

03:19.400 --> 03:22.700
projects are self-sustaining. The more you write the more things you want to write about

03:22.700 --> 03:27.280
and the more you program the more programming ideas you have. For me each video spawns more

03:27.280 --> 03:30.440
videos. The daylight savings one for example originally contained spots for information

03:30.440 --> 03:34.180
about longitude and time zones and the seasons that all got cut but will probably become

03:34.180 --> 03:39.320
their own videos at some point. Also I listened to a monstrous number of audio books and podcasts

03:39.320 --> 03:42.660
if you're interested you can see some of my favorites here. These help keep me in touch

03:42.660 --> 03:46.280
with the wider world and expose me to ideas and information that I wouldn't have come

03:46.280 --> 03:50.540
across on my own. If you could live at any time in history when would it be? I wouldn't.

03:50.540 --> 03:54.500
Allow me to summarize all of human existence with this single graph. What's the best way

03:54.500 --> 03:59.000
to be successful on YouTube? Make videos people want to watch? I'm not trying to be glib here

03:59.000 --> 04:02.960
but when asked this question I see many YouTubers talk about the importance of upload schedules

04:02.960 --> 04:08.380
and managing your social media and collaborations and my experience says that's completely backwards.

04:08.380 --> 04:12.340
If your videos aren't interesting no one will care if you upload them regularly and Twitter

04:12.340 --> 04:16.680
followers don't get you views views get you Twitter followers and people who want to collaborate

04:16.680 --> 04:21.420
with you. I know it's not very helpful advice but it's the most truthful advice I can give.

04:21.420 --> 04:24.200
What's the most interesting fact you've ever been told? It's difficult to pick just one

04:24.200 --> 04:27.960
from an entire lifetime but last year Veritasium visited me in London and walked me through

04:27.960 --> 04:31.620
the process by which trees get water from their roots to their leaves. That sounds really

04:31.620 --> 04:35.660
boring but it was one of the most mind-blowing conversations I've had in a long time. How

04:35.660 --> 04:39.460
often do you engage with professionals while you research? For me being confused and frustrated

04:39.460 --> 04:43.020
with the topic is a vital part of figuring out how to explain it to others so I'd say

04:43.020 --> 04:48.340
95% of research I do on my own. If I'm really out of depth on my topic like the debt video

04:48.340 --> 04:52.140
and the pope video I try very hard to find an expert to look over the final draft of

04:52.140 --> 04:57.100
my script but time constraints and finding trustworthy experts is sometimes a bit difficult.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.040
What's your favorite internal organ? The brain because it's the one that's me. Is there any

05:01.040 --> 05:04.800
part of science you want to be proven wrong? Yes the current interpretations of the ultimate

05:04.800 --> 05:09.360
fate of the universe all make me sad. Can you answer 10 questions in under 30 seconds?

05:09.360 --> 05:12.680
What is your favorite scientific study ever published? Unskilled and unaware further explorations

05:12.680 --> 05:16.920
of absent self-interest among the incompetent. Link in the description. Hogwarts house? Ravenclaw

05:16.920 --> 05:21.240
I'd hope. Celsius or Fahrenheit? Fahrenheit. Kirk or Picard? Picard. Do you wear glasses?

05:21.240 --> 05:25.160
Uh yeah. Favorite empire? The second one. Those monks were awesome. How can a country

05:25.160 --> 05:28.920
be totally self-sufficient as in no imports or exports? Simple resort to a medieval level

05:28.920 --> 05:32.760
of technology. Favorite sport? No. Should science play a bigger role in politics? What

05:32.760 --> 05:35.760
you mean the method by which we determine the truth? Yeah I think it should. Can you

05:35.760 --> 05:39.680
answer 10 questions in under 30 seconds? Apparently. Alright thanks to everyone who

05:39.680 --> 05:41.680
submitted questions. It's been fun, Internet.
