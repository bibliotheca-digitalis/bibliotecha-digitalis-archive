1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Who owns the Statue of Liberty? New York or New Jersey?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
It should be straightforward, but the island upon which the statue stands, Liberty Island,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,720
has been part of a long fight between the states over their river border and

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,120
the islands between them, with rounds in the 90s, the 80s, the 30s, the 1830s,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,200
and possibly more beyond 2000. But to understand, we must first go back to the 1600s.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,360
New Netherland was minding her own business when England, using bigger navy diplomacy,

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,240
made the Dutch colony hers. Here the trouble begins, for England split New Netherland in

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,360
twain, but not cleanly. The mess wasn't entirely England's fault. She was far away,

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,640
and maps in the 1600s, while they weren't bad, they weren't good either. Thus the

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,240
charter splitting New Netherlands reads,

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,560
This indenture made the four and twentieth day of June in the sixteenth year of

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
whereas by letter under patents of the great seal of England bearing date on or about the

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
twelfth day of... Okay, okay. Did give and grant all that tract of land belonging to the westward

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,360
of Long Island and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea and part by

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,480
Hudson's River. Which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name of New

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,400
Caesarea or New Jersey? You pick. Oh boy, is this not an easy read. Paragraph breaks,

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,600
England. You should try them. This charter has uncertainty about the names of everything,

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
wrong latitude and longitude numbers, and incomplete descriptions of the rivers. It's

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
all a vague mess. For example, is this part of the Hudson River or not? The charter doesn't say.

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,360
And bounded on the east? But where? And there's another part about several other islands. But

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,280
which islands exactly? Like say Ellis Island and Liberty Island? England said whatever,

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,800
your problem now, and left the young colonies to 300 years of squabbling. New Jersey said the

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,680
Hudson flowed out to sea and her border ran down the middle of the river, like it does in

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,480
every other colonial charter, and thus the islands Staten, Ellis, and Liberty were hers.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,600
But New York, the Empire State, disagreed. The Hudson River flows roundward, then onward. These

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,760
islands? New York. And also the river, the whole river, and the piers you've built into the river.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,840
All New York, all belong to us. New Jersey didn't agree, but when borders are vague, bigger stick

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,880
diplomacy rules. And with the wealthy and powerful city of New Amster or New York at the heart of the

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,080
conflict, New York got what New York wanted. When New Caesarea or New Jersey asked, why don't we

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,200
split the river? New York asked, why don't you make me? And also, where are my taxes from those

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,120
piers? And also, this island is a smallpox quarantine now. And also stop hitting yourself.

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,200
By 1832, New Jersey had enough and called in the teacher or Supreme Court. New York didn't show up,

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
saying the court had no authority to settle a disagreement between the states, which sounds

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,320
crazy now, but was kind of an unsettled question at the time, because America was having power

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,200
struggles with unruly states then, and New York blowing off the Supreme Court wasn't helping.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,080
Worse, if the Supreme Court ruled, New York must share her borders, which seemed likely, New York

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,600
would comply. Whoops, no, New York was going to tell the court to get bent. America, trying to grow

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,800
up to be a powerful federal government, did not want this. So the Supreme Court decided to not

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,600
take the case right now, maybe later, and then America used some political leverage to get New

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,160
York to agree to settle the matter privately with New Jersey. Look, this is your decision. No need

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,880
to get that Supreme Court involved in all of this, and no need for me to enforce their ruling. Isn't

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,280
that better for everyone? So the two states haggled. New Jersey gave up her claims to Staten

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,560
Island, and in return, New York agreed New Jersey's northern border extended into the river and down

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,640
the middle, past Ellis Island, past Liberty Island, squeezing around Staten Island before

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,400
going back out to sea. Aha! So the Statue of Liberty is in New Jersey. No, New Jersey also

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,880
gave up Ellis Island and Liberty Island too, which seems like giving up a lot, but look,

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,920
river access in the age of steamboats was a big deal, and sacrificing a couple islands to get

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,240
her peers back was worth it. And America was happy because a power struggle between her and the

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,920
states was averted, and everything was going to be smooth sailing. Oh... Uh, anyway, both islands

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,640
are New York enclaves inside New Jersey's border, which does make answering the question,

51
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,680
where is the Statue of Liberty, with, in New Jersey, technically correct in the most pointless

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,560
kind of way. Now, in the midst of all this, America noticed Liberty Island's rather strategic

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,560
position, and she took it for herself as federal land and built a pretty star fortress upon it

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,880
that could shoot in every direction. Look familiar? Later, when France sent America the

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,920
Statue of Liberty as a symbol of their eternal friendship, a bond forged side by side in the

56
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,160
heat of the young rebel's battle for freedom from the empire, a bond America would surely hashtag

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,040
never forget. America said, I will put it right here, where it will be the first thing everyone

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,360
coming to the United States will see. BFFs France, BFFs forever. So the statue was put atop an old

59
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,280
federal fort on federal land, and pow, made a national monument. So America owns the statue?

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,600
This opens a book titled, What is Federal Land? Like, what does it mean for real though,

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,560
which will be firmly closed as a story for another time. Otherwise, we will never finish this. It's

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
still only the 60s, and we have yet to talk about the squabble over the land below the water. Yes,

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,560
really. So back to Ellis Island for a moment, which 150 years after borders were supposedly settled,

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,080
New Jersey claimed as hers again, partly. See, in the 1800s, the island was yay big,

65
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,000
but by the 1990s, it was yay big. And because the rivalries of youth never really end,

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,040
New Jersey again brought in the Supreme Court. This time, New York showed up promptly. The added

67
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,040
land New Jersey said was hers. New York disagreed, saying the embiggened island was still her island.

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,280
Now, how did Ellis Island get bigger? Well, New York claimed while digging up the subways,

69
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,120
she dumped the dirt here, in New Jersey's half of the river. But her dirt, her new land, which

70
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,600
is an interesting territorial acquisition strategy. But neither New York nor New Jersey

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,040
could find any paperwork for the court to prove where the land came from. So how Ellis Island

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,240
grew three sizes is just lost to history. But whatever. The court ruled everything above the

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,280
water was New York, and everything below the water was New Jersey. But if below became above

74
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,960
New New Jersey, it would be. And thus, this island belongs to New Jersey, with just this little

75
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,040
original part being New York, which is a sublime and ridiculous border that opens the door to one

76
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,960
squabble remaining. Liberty Island was originally yay, but now it's yay. Which means this part

77
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,320
should be New Jersey, not New York. Though it hasn't been fought over yet, possibly because

78
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,120
neither state has noticed. And while it would still leave Lady Liberty on the New York side,

79
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,640
you know what would be on the New Jersey side? The gift shop. And the only thing more important

80
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,440
than who owns the monument is who owns the gift shop for the monument. We will see. But as it is,

81
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
within the waters of New Jersey, there's an island of New York that's

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,440
federal land atop which the National Monument of the Statue of Liberty stands.

83
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh, there's also Shooter's Island. The state border runs right through it. I'm not sure

84
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,000
anyone noticed. It's a bird sanctuary run by New York. So, whatever.
