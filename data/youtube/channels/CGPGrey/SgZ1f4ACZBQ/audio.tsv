0	3120	Who owns the Statue of Liberty? New York or New Jersey?
3120	7440	It should be straightforward, but the island upon which the statue stands, Liberty Island,
8880	12720	has been part of a long fight between the states over their river border and
12720	17120	the islands between them, with rounds in the 90s, the 80s, the 30s, the 1830s,
17120	23200	and possibly more beyond 2000. But to understand, we must first go back to the 1600s.
23200	27360	New Netherland was minding her own business when England, using bigger navy diplomacy,
27360	32240	made the Dutch colony hers. Here the trouble begins, for England split New Netherland in
32240	37360	twain, but not cleanly. The mess wasn't entirely England's fault. She was far away,
37360	42640	and maps in the 1600s, while they weren't bad, they weren't good either. Thus the
42640	44240	charter splitting New Netherlands reads,
44960	48560	This indenture made the four and twentieth day of June in the sixteenth year of
49440	54000	whereas by letter under patents of the great seal of England bearing date on or about the
54000	59440	twelfth day of... Okay, okay. Did give and grant all that tract of land belonging to the westward
59440	65360	of Long Island and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea and part by
65360	70480	Hudson's River. Which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name of New
70480	76400	Caesarea or New Jersey? You pick. Oh boy, is this not an easy read. Paragraph breaks,
76400	81600	England. You should try them. This charter has uncertainty about the names of everything,
81600	86320	wrong latitude and longitude numbers, and incomplete descriptions of the rivers. It's
86320	91520	all a vague mess. For example, is this part of the Hudson River or not? The charter doesn't say.
91520	97360	And bounded on the east? But where? And there's another part about several other islands. But
97360	103280	which islands exactly? Like say Ellis Island and Liberty Island? England said whatever,
103280	108800	your problem now, and left the young colonies to 300 years of squabbling. New Jersey said the
108800	113680	Hudson flowed out to sea and her border ran down the middle of the river, like it does in
113680	118480	every other colonial charter, and thus the islands Staten, Ellis, and Liberty were hers.
119280	125600	But New York, the Empire State, disagreed. The Hudson River flows roundward, then onward. These
125600	131760	islands? New York. And also the river, the whole river, and the piers you've built into the river.
131760	137840	All New York, all belong to us. New Jersey didn't agree, but when borders are vague, bigger stick
137840	142880	diplomacy rules. And with the wealthy and powerful city of New Amster or New York at the heart of the
142880	148080	conflict, New York got what New York wanted. When New Caesarea or New Jersey asked, why don't we
148080	153200	split the river? New York asked, why don't you make me? And also, where are my taxes from those
153200	159120	piers? And also, this island is a smallpox quarantine now. And also stop hitting yourself.
159120	165200	By 1832, New Jersey had enough and called in the teacher or Supreme Court. New York didn't show up,
165280	169200	saying the court had no authority to settle a disagreement between the states, which sounds
169200	174320	crazy now, but was kind of an unsettled question at the time, because America was having power
174320	179200	struggles with unruly states then, and New York blowing off the Supreme Court wasn't helping.
179200	184080	Worse, if the Supreme Court ruled, New York must share her borders, which seemed likely, New York
184080	189600	would comply. Whoops, no, New York was going to tell the court to get bent. America, trying to grow
189600	194800	up to be a powerful federal government, did not want this. So the Supreme Court decided to not
194800	199600	take the case right now, maybe later, and then America used some political leverage to get New
199600	204160	York to agree to settle the matter privately with New Jersey. Look, this is your decision. No need
204160	208880	to get that Supreme Court involved in all of this, and no need for me to enforce their ruling. Isn't
208880	213280	that better for everyone? So the two states haggled. New Jersey gave up her claims to Staten
213280	218560	Island, and in return, New York agreed New Jersey's northern border extended into the river and down
218560	224640	the middle, past Ellis Island, past Liberty Island, squeezing around Staten Island before
224640	230400	going back out to sea. Aha! So the Statue of Liberty is in New Jersey. No, New Jersey also
230400	234880	gave up Ellis Island and Liberty Island too, which seems like giving up a lot, but look,
234880	239920	river access in the age of steamboats was a big deal, and sacrificing a couple islands to get
239920	244240	her peers back was worth it. And America was happy because a power struggle between her and the
244240	251920	states was averted, and everything was going to be smooth sailing. Oh... Uh, anyway, both islands
251920	256640	are New York enclaves inside New Jersey's border, which does make answering the question,
256640	261680	where is the Statue of Liberty, with, in New Jersey, technically correct in the most pointless
261680	266560	kind of way. Now, in the midst of all this, America noticed Liberty Island's rather strategic
266560	272560	position, and she took it for herself as federal land and built a pretty star fortress upon it
272560	278880	that could shoot in every direction. Look familiar? Later, when France sent America the
278880	283920	Statue of Liberty as a symbol of their eternal friendship, a bond forged side by side in the
283920	290160	heat of the young rebel's battle for freedom from the empire, a bond America would surely hashtag
290160	295040	never forget. America said, I will put it right here, where it will be the first thing everyone
295040	301360	coming to the United States will see. BFFs France, BFFs forever. So the statue was put atop an old
301360	307280	federal fort on federal land, and pow, made a national monument. So America owns the statue?
307280	311600	This opens a book titled, What is Federal Land? Like, what does it mean for real though,
311600	316560	which will be firmly closed as a story for another time. Otherwise, we will never finish this. It's
316560	320800	still only the 60s, and we have yet to talk about the squabble over the land below the water. Yes,
320800	326560	really. So back to Ellis Island for a moment, which 150 years after borders were supposedly settled,
326560	332080	New Jersey claimed as hers again, partly. See, in the 1800s, the island was yay big,
332080	338000	but by the 1990s, it was yay big. And because the rivalries of youth never really end,
338000	343040	New Jersey again brought in the Supreme Court. This time, New York showed up promptly. The added
343040	349040	land New Jersey said was hers. New York disagreed, saying the embiggened island was still her island.
349040	353280	Now, how did Ellis Island get bigger? Well, New York claimed while digging up the subways,
353280	359120	she dumped the dirt here, in New Jersey's half of the river. But her dirt, her new land, which
359120	363600	is an interesting territorial acquisition strategy. But neither New York nor New Jersey
363600	369040	could find any paperwork for the court to prove where the land came from. So how Ellis Island
369040	374240	grew three sizes is just lost to history. But whatever. The court ruled everything above the
374240	379280	water was New York, and everything below the water was New Jersey. But if below became above
379280	384960	New New Jersey, it would be. And thus, this island belongs to New Jersey, with just this little
384960	391040	original part being New York, which is a sublime and ridiculous border that opens the door to one
391040	396960	squabble remaining. Liberty Island was originally yay, but now it's yay. Which means this part
396960	402320	should be New Jersey, not New York. Though it hasn't been fought over yet, possibly because
402320	407120	neither state has noticed. And while it would still leave Lady Liberty on the New York side,
407120	412640	you know what would be on the New Jersey side? The gift shop. And the only thing more important
412640	419440	than who owns the monument is who owns the gift shop for the monument. We will see. But as it is,
419440	422880	within the waters of New Jersey, there's an island of New York that's
422880	427440	federal land atop which the National Monument of the Statue of Liberty stands.
427440	443920	Oh, there's also Shooter's Island. The state border runs right through it. I'm not sure
443920	448000	anyone noticed. It's a bird sanctuary run by New York. So, whatever.
