0	3640	How many countries are there? Easy, just grab a map and start counting, yes?
4240	10120	No. Not all maps are created equal, borders will differ depending on who you got that map from. So if individuals disagree
10120	15340	then surely a committee will save the day. Go to the United Nations, find the room where the countries sit, each with a little
15340	22040	name tag, start counting and get an answer. Now of course countries come and countries go, but at the time this video was made the answer
22040	29080	is 193. Fastest video ever, right? Except you know this isn't over. The United Nations list is less a complete class roster than a club
29080	36000	of membership that doesn't include everyone. Take Vatican City, who is a country but is too cool for school when it comes to being a member of the United Nations.
36000	42600	And while Vatican City's exact situation is complicated, he's straightforward compared to other non-United Nations countries... or places.
42600	50600	The terminology is going to have to be a bit unclear here. Take Kosovo, who wants to join the UN club, but membership requires none of these five countries to reject you.
50600	58360	And while the United States, United Kingdom and France think Kosovo is a country, Russia and China think she's just a rebellious part of Serbia and so veto her membership.
58400	65400	As for everyone else, just over half recognize Kosovo as independent and Kosovo, adorably, has a website where she thanks each one in their own language.
65400	73200	But Kosovo is not the only other place that wants to be considered a real country. There's Transnistria, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
73200	78200	which might or might not be part of Moldova, Azerbaijan or Georgia depending on who you ask.
78200	87600	Two of these countries no UN member recognize as countries and the other two have only five supporters, though all four of these places recognize each other as countries.
87840	91840	There's also the Sorari Arab Democratic Republic and Northern Cyprus, each with their own supporters.
91840	99840	At this point you might be thinking, okay, seriously, what's the deal? I don't care who these guys think are countries, are these places countries or not?
99840	104840	If I fly to one for a holiday, will it look like a country when I get there? The answer is maybe.
104840	111840	These countries are all autonomous to some extent, with governments that issue passports, though these may be of rather limited use.
111840	116840	And depending on which ones you're visiting, they may have more or less control of the territory they claim as theirs.
117080	119080	You won't always find a clear border.
119080	125080	What makes many of these places fuzzy is that they're usually born of conflict in the recent-ish past.
125080	128080	That answer is probably less helpful than you want, so think of it like this.
128080	132080	While the United States is clearly a country now, in 1776 not so much.
132080	141080	Then she was just an idea in the minds of rebel scum, she wasn't recognized as a country instantly and without diplomatic effort to change that young America would never have made it on her own.
141320	148320	Much like what happened a century later when she got her own rebel who, unlike elder sister, failed in the diplomacy department, so yeah.
148320	154320	And so it goes today with many of the maybe countries in the world, maybe their future United States and maybe their future confederacies,
154320	158320	but in the moment it's hard to say because these things can take decades to settle.
158320	162320	By the way, these maybe countries are super awkward for countries to deal with.
162320	168320	While your tiny island nation might not want to get involved in the affairs of distant lands, you still have to decide to send a diplomat or not,
168320	172320	and that's when action forces you to pick a side in every territorial skirmish in the world.
172320	181320	A notably awkward case being Taiwan, or sorry, Chinese Taipei, which is totally part of China and no one would ever think otherwise.
181320	183320	Is China gone?
183320	190320	Okay, by any reasonable definition Taiwan is a separate country and has been for years, but China won't let go and insists you call her Chinese Taipei.
190320	194320	And don't forget who makes all your clothing and utensils and phones and computers and everything.
194320	200320	So almost all countries, including the mighty United States, play along even though they unofficially acknowledge Taiwan's independence
200320	206320	and do things that wouldn't make sense otherwise, like sending aircraft carriers to protect one part of China from another part of China?
206320	211320	Thus the innocent question, how many countries has led us straight to a big World War 3 press here to start button,
211320	216320	which is getting depressing, so let's move on to... oh, right.
216320	220320	No more politics. On to higher ideals.
220320	221320	The Olympics.
221320	225320	Surely from their perch among the gods they have a disinterested view of the countries below.
225320	226320	How many are there, Olympics?
226320	228320	Two hundred and four. Huh.
228320	230320	So Olympics is a bit special.
230320	234320	She defines Puerto Rico as a country, even though it's unambiguously part of the United States,
234320	237320	as well as Bermuda and Aruba, which are connected to the UK and the Netherlands,
237320	243320	along with a bunch of other places that are happy to play in her Olympic games as nations but make no claims to independence.
243320	248320	Presumably Olympics includes these to bump up the numbers so she can say more than 200 countries compete,
248320	251320	though even her inflated list doesn't include Vatican City,
251320	255320	because given his demographics, divine intervention would be required to take home a gold.
255320	259320	And Vatican City brings us right back to the core of the difficulty with this question.
259320	264320	A consistent definition of country is impossible because your checklist needs to include both Vatican City,
264320	270320	the least country-like country that's still a country, and also exclude the anti-Vatican City, Hong Kong,
270320	272320	the most country-like country that isn't.
272320	276320	Also, don't forget from previous episodes the seemingly endless territories
276320	279320	which look and act like independent countries but just sort of aren't,
279320	284320	and this isn't even bringing up the various nutters who plant a flag on an island or an oil rig,
284320	288320	start printing currency on their fancy inkjet, and declare Dilutopia a new nation.
288320	290320	So with no checklist to follow, where does that leave us?
290320	293320	The best answer to the question, how many countries for the foreseeable future,
293320	297320	is probably to say around 200, and leave it at that.
297320	301320	An answer with more significant figures implies more agreement than there really is,
301320	308320	because ultimately what makes a country a country is if other countries think that country is a country.
