0	5960	Good morning, Internet. I came out here to write and do research and to think about the channel and its evolution.
5960	12320	The Staten Island video, for example, started life as part of the background reading for the Statue of Liberty video.
12320	19080	Originally planned to be just a small footnote a couple weeks later, I got a little obsessed with the story of Christopher Billup,
19080	24800	and that small footnote took one year and two transatlantic flights to finish.
24800	25600	That's a lot.
25600	32320	To cover costs, I should have put an ad at the end of it, but I just don't think that would have worked creatively for the project.
32320	33120	Think about it.
33120	40560	Instead of leaving past gray, in a cemetery, alone, soaking wet, and, frankly, half-crazed,
40560	44360	to end on, this video was brought to you by, I couldn't do it.
44360	46520	And it was much the same with the road trip video.
46520	49080	That was a real transformative life event for me,
49080	53800	and the project became such a difficult technical nightmare over three summers to finish,
53800	57040	that by the time it was done, it was just too personal.
57040	62640	So coming here and thinking about the videos I've been working on, and looking at my plans for future videos,
62640	64760	I see a lot of projects like those.
64760	71840	Projects that don't make financial sense without a sponsor, and that don't make creative sense with one.
71840	76360	So, I'm here to ask if I can double down on you.
76360	80920	You, the viewer who watches and really likes the kind of thing I make.
80920	85000	If that's you, consider supporting the channel directly on Patreon.
85000	88080	Unless you're in school, of course, students are forbidden from donating.
88080	91640	Your job is to work on you and make yourself an independent person in the world,
91640	95160	which is a hard enough task that should require all of your attention and resources.
95160	97080	Focus on that. I'll catch you later.
97080	99840	For everyone else, there's no pressure or obligation here.
99840	104440	I only want patrons to support my work who are happy and able to do so.
104440	107240	If you can't, we're good. Just watching is support.
107280	111320	Anyway, I think you can see now why sometimes things take a while.
111320	114760	We all like to joke about how long it is between grey uploads.
114760	117320	I see you in the comments. I like to make those jokes.
117320	120360	I wouldn't want to live on an internet without recurring memes.
120360	127000	But it's important for me for you to know that this channel is the creative core of my life.
127000	131400	It's my full-time work, sometimes to the point of real madness.
131400	135120	Anyway, thank you for watching. Consider giving on Patreon.
135120	138280	And now, I've got some scripts I'm gonna go work on.
138280	140800	I'll see you later, internet. Have a great day.
