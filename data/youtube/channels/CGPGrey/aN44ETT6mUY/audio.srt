00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Good morning, Internet. I came out here to write and do research and to think about the channel and its evolution.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,320
The Staten Island video, for example, started life as part of the background reading for the Statue of Liberty video.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,080
Originally planned to be just a small footnote a couple weeks later, I got a little obsessed with the story of Christopher Billup,

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,800
and that small footnote took one year and two transatlantic flights to finish.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,600
That's a lot.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,320
To cover costs, I should have put an ad at the end of it, but I just don't think that would have worked creatively for the project.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,120
Think about it.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,560
Instead of leaving past gray, in a cemetery, alone, soaking wet, and, frankly, half-crazed,

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,360
to end on, this video was brought to you by, I couldn't do it.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,520
And it was much the same with the road trip video.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,080
That was a real transformative life event for me,

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,800
and the project became such a difficult technical nightmare over three summers to finish,

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,040
that by the time it was done, it was just too personal.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,640
So coming here and thinking about the videos I've been working on, and looking at my plans for future videos,

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,760
I see a lot of projects like those.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,840
Projects that don't make financial sense without a sponsor, and that don't make creative sense with one.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,360
So, I'm here to ask if I can double down on you.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,920
You, the viewer who watches and really likes the kind of thing I make.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,000
If that's you, consider supporting the channel directly on Patreon.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,080
Unless you're in school, of course, students are forbidden from donating.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,640
Your job is to work on you and make yourself an independent person in the world,

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,160
which is a hard enough task that should require all of your attention and resources.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,080
Focus on that. I'll catch you later.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,840
For everyone else, there's no pressure or obligation here.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,440
I only want patrons to support my work who are happy and able to do so.

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,240
If you can't, we're good. Just watching is support.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,320
Anyway, I think you can see now why sometimes things take a while.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,760
We all like to joke about how long it is between grey uploads.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,320
I see you in the comments. I like to make those jokes.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,360
I wouldn't want to live on an internet without recurring memes.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,000
But it's important for me for you to know that this channel is the creative core of my life.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,400
It's my full-time work, sometimes to the point of real madness.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,120
Anyway, thank you for watching. Consider giving on Patreon.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,280
And now, I've got some scripts I'm gonna go work on.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll see you later, internet. Have a great day.
