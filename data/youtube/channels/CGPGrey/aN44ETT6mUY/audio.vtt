00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
Good morning, Internet. I came out here to write and do research and to think about the channel and its evolution.

00:05.960 --> 00:12.320
The Staten Island video, for example, started life as part of the background reading for the Statue of Liberty video.

00:12.320 --> 00:19.080
Originally planned to be just a small footnote a couple weeks later, I got a little obsessed with the story of Christopher Billup,

00:19.080 --> 00:24.800
and that small footnote took one year and two transatlantic flights to finish.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.600
That's a lot.

00:25.600 --> 00:32.320
To cover costs, I should have put an ad at the end of it, but I just don't think that would have worked creatively for the project.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.120
Think about it.

00:33.120 --> 00:40.560
Instead of leaving past gray, in a cemetery, alone, soaking wet, and, frankly, half-crazed,

00:40.560 --> 00:44.360
to end on, this video was brought to you by, I couldn't do it.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.520
And it was much the same with the road trip video.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.080
That was a real transformative life event for me,

00:49.080 --> 00:53.800
and the project became such a difficult technical nightmare over three summers to finish,

00:53.800 --> 00:57.040
that by the time it was done, it was just too personal.

00:57.040 --> 01:02.640
So coming here and thinking about the videos I've been working on, and looking at my plans for future videos,

01:02.640 --> 01:04.760
I see a lot of projects like those.

01:04.760 --> 01:11.840
Projects that don't make financial sense without a sponsor, and that don't make creative sense with one.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.360
So, I'm here to ask if I can double down on you.

01:16.360 --> 01:20.920
You, the viewer who watches and really likes the kind of thing I make.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.000
If that's you, consider supporting the channel directly on Patreon.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.080
Unless you're in school, of course, students are forbidden from donating.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.640
Your job is to work on you and make yourself an independent person in the world,

01:31.640 --> 01:35.160
which is a hard enough task that should require all of your attention and resources.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.080
Focus on that. I'll catch you later.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.840
For everyone else, there's no pressure or obligation here.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.440
I only want patrons to support my work who are happy and able to do so.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.240
If you can't, we're good. Just watching is support.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.320
Anyway, I think you can see now why sometimes things take a while.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.760
We all like to joke about how long it is between grey uploads.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.320
I see you in the comments. I like to make those jokes.

01:57.320 --> 02:00.360
I wouldn't want to live on an internet without recurring memes.

02:00.360 --> 02:07.000
But it's important for me for you to know that this channel is the creative core of my life.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.400
It's my full-time work, sometimes to the point of real madness.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.120
Anyway, thank you for watching. Consider giving on Patreon.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.280
And now, I've got some scripts I'm gonna go work on.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.800
I'll see you later, internet. Have a great day.
