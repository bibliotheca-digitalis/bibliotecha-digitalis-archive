00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
The great city of London, known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets

00:04.920 --> 00:06.000
and famous bridges.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.760
It's arguably the financial capital of the world and home to over 11,000 people.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.760
Wait what?

00:11.760 --> 00:12.760
11,000?

00:12.760 --> 00:16.640
That's right, but the city of London is a different place from London.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.600
Though London is also known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets,

00:20.600 --> 00:24.800
famous bridges and is home to the government, royal family and 7 million people.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.040
But if you look at a map of London crafted by a careful cartographer, that map will have

00:28.040 --> 00:30.180
a one square mile hole near the middle.

00:30.180 --> 00:33.720
It's here where the city of London lives inside the city named London.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.280
Despite these confusingly close names, the two Londons have separate city halls and elect

00:37.280 --> 00:40.880
separate mayors who collect separate taxes to fund separate police who enforce separate

00:40.880 --> 00:41.880
laws.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.000
The mayor of the city of London has a fancy title, the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor

00:45.000 --> 00:46.960
of London to match his fancy outfit.

00:46.960 --> 00:50.340
He also gets to ride in a golden carriage and work in a guild hall while the mayor of

00:50.340 --> 00:53.640
London has to wear a suit, ride a bike and work in an office building.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.780
The city of London also has its own flag and its own crest which is awesome and makes London's

00:57.780 --> 00:59.780
lack of either twice as sad.

00:59.780 --> 01:02.980
To top it off, the city of London gets to act more like one of the countries in the

01:02.980 --> 01:08.300
UK than just an oddly located city, for uniquely, the corporation that runs the city of London

01:08.300 --> 01:11.940
is older than the United Kingdom by several hundred years.

01:11.940 --> 01:15.260
So how did the UK end up with two Londons, one inside of the other?

01:15.260 --> 01:16.260
Because Romans.

01:16.260 --> 01:20.040
2,000 years ago they came to Great Britain, killed a bunch of druids and founded a trading

01:20.040 --> 01:22.700
post on the River Thames and named it Londinium.

01:22.700 --> 01:26.620
Being Romans, they got to work doing what Romans do, enforcing laws, increasing trade,

01:26.620 --> 01:30.340
building temples, public baths, roads, bridges and a wall to defend their work.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.740
And it's this wall which is why the current city of London exists.

01:33.740 --> 01:37.540
For though the Romans came and the Romans went and kingdoms rose and kingdoms fell,

01:37.540 --> 01:40.100
the wall endured protecting the city within.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.700
And the city, governing itself and trading with the world, grew rich.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.540
A thousand years after the Romans, yet still a thousand years ago, when William the Conqueror

01:47.540 --> 01:51.580
came to Great Britain to conquer everything and begin modern British history, he found

01:51.580 --> 01:55.820
the city of London with its sturdy walls more challenging to defeat than farmers on open

01:55.820 --> 01:56.820
fields.

01:56.820 --> 02:00.500
So he agreed to recognise the rights and privileges city of Londoners were used to in return for

02:00.500 --> 02:02.840
them recognising him as the new king.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.500
Though after the negotiation William quickly built towers around the city of London which

02:06.500 --> 02:10.300
were just as much about protecting William from the locals within as defending against

02:10.300 --> 02:11.920
the Vikings from without.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.460
This started a thousand year long tradition whereby monarchs always reconfirmed that yes

02:15.460 --> 02:19.520
the city of London is a special unique place that's best left to its own business while

02:19.520 --> 02:21.480
simultaneously distrusting it.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.800
Many a monarch thought the city of London was too powerful and rich and one even built

02:24.800 --> 02:29.200
a new capital city nearby named Westminster to compete with the city of London and hopefully

02:29.200 --> 02:31.440
suck power and wealth away from it.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.760
This was the start of the second London.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.600
As the centuries passed Westminster grew and merged with nearby towns eventually surrounding

02:37.600 --> 02:40.140
the walled in and still separate city of London.

02:40.140 --> 02:44.480
But people began to call the whole urban collection London and the name became official when parliament

02:44.480 --> 02:48.380
joined the towns together under a single municipal government with a mayor.

02:48.380 --> 02:52.480
But the mayor of London still doesn't have power over the tiny city of London which has

02:52.480 --> 02:56.360
rules and traditions like nowhere else in the country and possibly the world.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.840
For example the ruling monarch doesn't just enter the city of London on a whim but instead

02:59.840 --> 03:02.620
asks for permission from the Lord Mayor at a ceremony.

03:02.620 --> 03:06.880
While it's not required by law the ceremony is unusual to say the least.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.480
The city of London also has a representative in parliament, the remembrancer, whose job

03:10.480 --> 03:12.800
it is to protect the city's special rights.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.320
Because of this laws passed by parliament sometimes don't apply to the city of London,

03:16.320 --> 03:19.600
most notably voting reform laws which we'll discuss next time.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.420
But if you're curious for a preview unlike anywhere else in the UK elections in the city

03:23.420 --> 03:27.240
of London involve medieval guilds and modern companies.

03:27.240 --> 03:31.460
Finally the city of London also owns and operates land and buildings far outside its border

03:31.460 --> 03:33.080
making it quite wealthy.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.560
Once you start looking for the city's crest you'll find it in lots of unexpected places

03:36.560 --> 03:41.560
most notably on Tower Bridge which while being in London is operated by the city of London.

03:41.560 --> 03:45.560
These crests everywhere when combined with the city of London's age and wealth and quasi-independent

03:45.560 --> 03:48.960
status make it an irresistible temptation for conspiracy nuts.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.280
Get in the oldest Masonic temple and it's not long before the crazy part of the internet

03:52.280 --> 03:56.420
starts yelling about secret societies controlling the world via the finance industry from inside

03:56.420 --> 03:57.780
the city state of London.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.200
And don't forget the reptilian alien queen who's really behind it all.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.980
But conspiracy theories aside the city of London is not an independent nation like the

04:04.980 --> 04:08.040
Vatican is no matter how much you might read it on the internet.

04:08.040 --> 04:12.780
Rather it's a unique place in the United Kingdom with a long and very complicated history.

04:12.780 --> 04:17.800
The wall that began all this 2,000 years ago is now mostly gone so the border between London

04:17.800 --> 04:20.160
and its secret inner city isn't so obvious.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.980
Though next time you're in London if you come across a small dragon on the street he still

04:23.980 --> 04:27.560
guards the entrance to the city in a city in a country in a country.
