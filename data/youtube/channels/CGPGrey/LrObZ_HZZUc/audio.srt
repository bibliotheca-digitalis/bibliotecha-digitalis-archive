1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
The great city of London, known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,000
and famous bridges.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,760
It's arguably the financial capital of the world and home to over 11,000 people.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
Wait what?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
11,000?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,640
That's right, but the city of London is a different place from London.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,600
Though London is also known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,800
famous bridges and is home to the government, royal family and 7 million people.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,040
But if you look at a map of London crafted by a careful cartographer, that map will have

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,180
a one square mile hole near the middle.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,720
It's here where the city of London lives inside the city named London.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,280
Despite these confusingly close names, the two Londons have separate city halls and elect

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,880
separate mayors who collect separate taxes to fund separate police who enforce separate

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
laws.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,000
The mayor of the city of London has a fancy title, the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,960
of London to match his fancy outfit.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,340
He also gets to ride in a golden carriage and work in a guild hall while the mayor of

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,640
London has to wear a suit, ride a bike and work in an office building.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,780
The city of London also has its own flag and its own crest which is awesome and makes London's

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
lack of either twice as sad.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,980
To top it off, the city of London gets to act more like one of the countries in the

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,300
UK than just an oddly located city, for uniquely, the corporation that runs the city of London

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,940
is older than the United Kingdom by several hundred years.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,260
So how did the UK end up with two Londons, one inside of the other?

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
Because Romans.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,040
2,000 years ago they came to Great Britain, killed a bunch of druids and founded a trading

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,700
post on the River Thames and named it Londinium.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,620
Being Romans, they got to work doing what Romans do, enforcing laws, increasing trade,

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,340
building temples, public baths, roads, bridges and a wall to defend their work.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,740
And it's this wall which is why the current city of London exists.

31
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,540
For though the Romans came and the Romans went and kingdoms rose and kingdoms fell,

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,100
the wall endured protecting the city within.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,700
And the city, governing itself and trading with the world, grew rich.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,540
A thousand years after the Romans, yet still a thousand years ago, when William the Conqueror

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,580
came to Great Britain to conquer everything and begin modern British history, he found

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,820
the city of London with its sturdy walls more challenging to defeat than farmers on open

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
fields.

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,500
So he agreed to recognise the rights and privileges city of Londoners were used to in return for

39
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,840
them recognising him as the new king.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,500
Though after the negotiation William quickly built towers around the city of London which

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,300
were just as much about protecting William from the locals within as defending against

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,920
the Vikings from without.

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,460
This started a thousand year long tradition whereby monarchs always reconfirmed that yes

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,520
the city of London is a special unique place that's best left to its own business while

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,480
simultaneously distrusting it.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,800
Many a monarch thought the city of London was too powerful and rich and one even built

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,200
a new capital city nearby named Westminster to compete with the city of London and hopefully

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
suck power and wealth away from it.

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
This was the start of the second London.

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,600
As the centuries passed Westminster grew and merged with nearby towns eventually surrounding

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,140
the walled in and still separate city of London.

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,480
But people began to call the whole urban collection London and the name became official when parliament

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,380
joined the towns together under a single municipal government with a mayor.

54
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,480
But the mayor of London still doesn't have power over the tiny city of London which has

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,360
rules and traditions like nowhere else in the country and possibly the world.

56
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,840
For example the ruling monarch doesn't just enter the city of London on a whim but instead

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,620
asks for permission from the Lord Mayor at a ceremony.

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,880
While it's not required by law the ceremony is unusual to say the least.

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,480
The city of London also has a representative in parliament, the remembrancer, whose job

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
it is to protect the city's special rights.

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,320
Because of this laws passed by parliament sometimes don't apply to the city of London,

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,600
most notably voting reform laws which we'll discuss next time.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,420
But if you're curious for a preview unlike anywhere else in the UK elections in the city

64
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,240
of London involve medieval guilds and modern companies.

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,460
Finally the city of London also owns and operates land and buildings far outside its border

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,080
making it quite wealthy.

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,560
Once you start looking for the city's crest you'll find it in lots of unexpected places

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,560
most notably on Tower Bridge which while being in London is operated by the city of London.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,560
These crests everywhere when combined with the city of London's age and wealth and quasi-independent

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,960
status make it an irresistible temptation for conspiracy nuts.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,280
Get in the oldest Masonic temple and it's not long before the crazy part of the internet

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,420
starts yelling about secret societies controlling the world via the finance industry from inside

73
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,780
the city state of London.

74
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,200
And don't forget the reptilian alien queen who's really behind it all.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,980
But conspiracy theories aside the city of London is not an independent nation like the

76
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,040
Vatican is no matter how much you might read it on the internet.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,780
Rather it's a unique place in the United Kingdom with a long and very complicated history.

78
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,800
The wall that began all this 2,000 years ago is now mostly gone so the border between London

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,160
and its secret inner city isn't so obvious.

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,980
Though next time you're in London if you come across a small dragon on the street he still

81
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,560
guards the entrance to the city in a city in a country in a country.
