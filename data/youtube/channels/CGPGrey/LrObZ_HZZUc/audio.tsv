0	4920	The great city of London, known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets
4920	6000	and famous bridges.
6000	10760	It's arguably the financial capital of the world and home to over 11,000 people.
10760	11760	Wait what?
11760	12760	11,000?
12760	16640	That's right, but the city of London is a different place from London.
16640	20600	Though London is also known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets,
20600	24800	famous bridges and is home to the government, royal family and 7 million people.
24800	28040	But if you look at a map of London crafted by a careful cartographer, that map will have
28040	30180	a one square mile hole near the middle.
30180	33720	It's here where the city of London lives inside the city named London.
33720	37280	Despite these confusingly close names, the two Londons have separate city halls and elect
37280	40880	separate mayors who collect separate taxes to fund separate police who enforce separate
40880	41880	laws.
41880	45000	The mayor of the city of London has a fancy title, the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor
45000	46960	of London to match his fancy outfit.
46960	50340	He also gets to ride in a golden carriage and work in a guild hall while the mayor of
50340	53640	London has to wear a suit, ride a bike and work in an office building.
53640	57780	The city of London also has its own flag and its own crest which is awesome and makes London's
57780	59780	lack of either twice as sad.
59780	62980	To top it off, the city of London gets to act more like one of the countries in the
62980	68300	UK than just an oddly located city, for uniquely, the corporation that runs the city of London
68300	71940	is older than the United Kingdom by several hundred years.
71940	75260	So how did the UK end up with two Londons, one inside of the other?
75260	76260	Because Romans.
76260	80040	2,000 years ago they came to Great Britain, killed a bunch of druids and founded a trading
80040	82700	post on the River Thames and named it Londinium.
82700	86620	Being Romans, they got to work doing what Romans do, enforcing laws, increasing trade,
86620	90340	building temples, public baths, roads, bridges and a wall to defend their work.
90340	93740	And it's this wall which is why the current city of London exists.
93740	97540	For though the Romans came and the Romans went and kingdoms rose and kingdoms fell,
97540	100100	the wall endured protecting the city within.
100100	103700	And the city, governing itself and trading with the world, grew rich.
103700	107540	A thousand years after the Romans, yet still a thousand years ago, when William the Conqueror
107540	111580	came to Great Britain to conquer everything and begin modern British history, he found
111580	115820	the city of London with its sturdy walls more challenging to defeat than farmers on open
115820	116820	fields.
116820	120500	So he agreed to recognise the rights and privileges city of Londoners were used to in return for
120500	122840	them recognising him as the new king.
122840	126500	Though after the negotiation William quickly built towers around the city of London which
126500	130300	were just as much about protecting William from the locals within as defending against
130300	131920	the Vikings from without.
131920	135460	This started a thousand year long tradition whereby monarchs always reconfirmed that yes
135460	139520	the city of London is a special unique place that's best left to its own business while
139520	141480	simultaneously distrusting it.
141480	144800	Many a monarch thought the city of London was too powerful and rich and one even built
144800	149200	a new capital city nearby named Westminster to compete with the city of London and hopefully
149200	151440	suck power and wealth away from it.
151440	153760	This was the start of the second London.
153760	157600	As the centuries passed Westminster grew and merged with nearby towns eventually surrounding
157600	160140	the walled in and still separate city of London.
160140	164480	But people began to call the whole urban collection London and the name became official when parliament
164480	168380	joined the towns together under a single municipal government with a mayor.
168380	172480	But the mayor of London still doesn't have power over the tiny city of London which has
172480	176360	rules and traditions like nowhere else in the country and possibly the world.
176360	179840	For example the ruling monarch doesn't just enter the city of London on a whim but instead
179840	182620	asks for permission from the Lord Mayor at a ceremony.
182620	186880	While it's not required by law the ceremony is unusual to say the least.
186880	190480	The city of London also has a representative in parliament, the remembrancer, whose job
190480	192800	it is to protect the city's special rights.
192800	196320	Because of this laws passed by parliament sometimes don't apply to the city of London,
196320	199600	most notably voting reform laws which we'll discuss next time.
199600	203420	But if you're curious for a preview unlike anywhere else in the UK elections in the city
203420	207240	of London involve medieval guilds and modern companies.
207240	211460	Finally the city of London also owns and operates land and buildings far outside its border
211460	213080	making it quite wealthy.
213080	216560	Once you start looking for the city's crest you'll find it in lots of unexpected places
216560	221560	most notably on Tower Bridge which while being in London is operated by the city of London.
221560	225560	These crests everywhere when combined with the city of London's age and wealth and quasi-independent
225560	228960	status make it an irresistible temptation for conspiracy nuts.
228960	232280	Get in the oldest Masonic temple and it's not long before the crazy part of the internet
232280	236420	starts yelling about secret societies controlling the world via the finance industry from inside
236420	237780	the city state of London.
237780	241200	And don't forget the reptilian alien queen who's really behind it all.
241200	244980	But conspiracy theories aside the city of London is not an independent nation like the
244980	248040	Vatican is no matter how much you might read it on the internet.
248040	252780	Rather it's a unique place in the United Kingdom with a long and very complicated history.
252780	257800	The wall that began all this 2,000 years ago is now mostly gone so the border between London
257800	260160	and its secret inner city isn't so obvious.
260160	263980	Though next time you're in London if you come across a small dragon on the street he still
263980	267560	guards the entrance to the city in a city in a country in a country.
