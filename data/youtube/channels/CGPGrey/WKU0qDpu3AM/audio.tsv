0	5000	These books are all about this ring. How it's found and, spoiler alert, how it's destroyed.
5000	10000	While Tolkien built the largest and most consistent fictional universe, he sure didn't mind being vague at times.
10000	12000	So if you finished the story and then thought,
12000	15000	Wait, what can this ring do and where did it come from?
15000	16000	This is your video.
16000	17000	First thing first.
17000	19000	The One Ring is not the only ring.
19000	22000	It's Lord of the Ringses, after all, and that Lord is Sauron.
22000	29000	Long before this story starts, Sauron disguised himself and came to the elves to work with their master craftsman, Celebrimbor, to forge the Rings of Power.
29000	38000	Together they made sixteen, called the Lesser Rings, then Celebrimbor took Sauron's formula and made three on his own that turned out more powerful than the original sixteen.
38000	42000	Why make rings based on the suggestion of a stranger whose resume has a millennia-long gap?
42000	45000	Because he promised the rings would fix the elves' biggest problem.
45000	47000	This world is winding down.
47000	51000	The amount of big and awesome and magic decreases as a function of time here.
51000	55000	For elves, magic, immortal creatures, this is bad news.
55000	58000	Sauron said the rings would preserve what their wearers cared about most.
58000	62000	That's why the elven kingdoms are so fantastical compared to the rest of the world.
62000	64000	Their rings have preserved them.
64000	72000	Unlike the famous poem implies, the elves made all the rings for themselves, intending exactly zero to get into the hands of men or dwarves, whom the elves think are stinky.
72000	77000	So, obviously, something went wrong, which brings us back to the One Ring to rule them all.
77000	80000	Sauron's chief ability is to dominate the minds of others.
80000	87000	That's partly why he's able to control such large armies and he secretly made the One Ring as a kind of lens to focus this power.
87000	92000	His formula for ring construction, unknown to Celebrimbor, also made the wearers of the 19 rings more vulnerable.
92000	97000	Basically, the One Ring buffs his psi attack and the other rings debuff psi defense.
97000	105000	Plan A was to control a bunch of high-level elves, but when he put the One Ring on, the elves' base-level stats allowed them to resist and take off their rings just in time.
105000	113000	Sauron captured Celebrimbor and tortured him until he gave up the 16 lesser rings, but he died before revealing who was protecting the three most powerful ones.
113000	118000	So now Sauron had 16 mind-controlling rings and had to turn to Plan B, dwarves.
118000	123000	Sauron manipulated seven rings into the hands of the dwarven kings, but that didn't work well either.
123000	131000	Dwarves are a kind of clockwork creature Sauron found impossible to control, but the rings weren't super helpful for dwarves either, who loved treasure above all else.
131000	137000	So the rings grew their hordes large, enough to attract dragons, who ate the dwarves and their precious rings.
137000	141000	Finally, in the hands of men, ever the corruptible species, the rings worked as expected.
141000	146000	Sauron controlled their minds and, as mortals, they valued their lives the most, which the rings stretched for thousands of years.
146000	149000	Stretched so thin, the men turned into invisible wraiths.
149000	155000	Anyway, these domination plans don't go unnoticed. There's a big war, Sauron is defeated and fades, and the One Ring is lost.
155000	161000	But the One Ring is tricksy. It has a mind of its own and wants to get back to Sauron, which brings us back to its powers.
161000	168000	First, the ring tempts everyone, well, almost everyone, with promises that, yes, this little ring can be a mighty weapon or a tool to reshape the world.
168000	175000	And gosh, don't you just look like the best guy to use it. Let's go vanquish the powerful demigod who lives over there to get started, shall we? Hmm?
175000	182000	This is why the hobbits made great ring bearers, because they're pretty happy with the way things are and don't aspire to greatness.
182000	188000	Of course, there's Gollum, who started out as a hobbit, but all things considered, he held out pretty well for a couple hundred years.
188000	196000	Set the ring on the desk of most men and they wouldn't be able to finish their coffee before heading to Mordor to rule the world and do it right this time.
196000	202000	It's worth considering that the One Ring's promises are just lies, that no one could really overthrow Sauron with it.
202000	207000	The ring only wants to trick its wearer to get found, which brings us to invisibility.
207000	212000	Which, outside the minds of characters, is the only tangible power the ring displays for everyone else.
212000	222000	Invisibility seems great, but while you're hiding from that troll, you shine like a beacon in the unseen world, where the also-invisible ringwraiths can easily spot you.
222000	231000	In summary, the One Ring, A, turns you invisible in the most unhelpful manner, B, is probably filled with lies, because C, it's part of Sauron and works for him.
231000	240000	He's so connected to it that its destruction ends him for good, but the formula also intertwines the One Ring with all the rest, and so when it fails, so do they.
240000	243000	This is why the elves are so somber.
243000	249000	Victory over Sauron also means that the rings won't preserve their kingdoms anymore and all will diminish.
249000	254000	These books are the end of the Age of Magic and the beginning of the Age of Men.
