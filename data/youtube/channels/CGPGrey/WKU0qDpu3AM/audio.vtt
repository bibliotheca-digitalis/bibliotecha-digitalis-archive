These books are all about this ring. How it's found and, spoiler alert, how it's destroyed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
While Tolkien built the largest and most consistent fictional universe, he sure didn't mind being vague at times.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
So if you finished the story and then thought,

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Wait, what can this ring do and where did it come from?

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
This is your video.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
First thing first.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
The One Ring is not the only ring.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
It's Lord of the Ringses, after all, and that Lord is Sauron.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Long before this story starts, Sauron disguised himself and came to the elves to work with their master craftsman, Celebrimbor, to forge the Rings of Power.

00:29.000 --> 00:38.000
Together they made sixteen, called the Lesser Rings, then Celebrimbor took Sauron's formula and made three on his own that turned out more powerful than the original sixteen.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Why make rings based on the suggestion of a stranger whose resume has a millennia-long gap?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Because he promised the rings would fix the elves' biggest problem.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
This world is winding down.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
The amount of big and awesome and magic decreases as a function of time here.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
For elves, magic, immortal creatures, this is bad news.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Sauron said the rings would preserve what their wearers cared about most.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
That's why the elven kingdoms are so fantastical compared to the rest of the world.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Their rings have preserved them.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
Unlike the famous poem implies, the elves made all the rings for themselves, intending exactly zero to get into the hands of men or dwarves, whom the elves think are stinky.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
So, obviously, something went wrong, which brings us back to the One Ring to rule them all.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Sauron's chief ability is to dominate the minds of others.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
That's partly why he's able to control such large armies and he secretly made the One Ring as a kind of lens to focus this power.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
His formula for ring construction, unknown to Celebrimbor, also made the wearers of the 19 rings more vulnerable.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Basically, the One Ring buffs his psi attack and the other rings debuff psi defense.

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
Plan A was to control a bunch of high-level elves, but when he put the One Ring on, the elves' base-level stats allowed them to resist and take off their rings just in time.

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
Sauron captured Celebrimbor and tortured him until he gave up the 16 lesser rings, but he died before revealing who was protecting the three most powerful ones.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
So now Sauron had 16 mind-controlling rings and had to turn to Plan B, dwarves.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Sauron manipulated seven rings into the hands of the dwarven kings, but that didn't work well either.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
Dwarves are a kind of clockwork creature Sauron found impossible to control, but the rings weren't super helpful for dwarves either, who loved treasure above all else.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
So the rings grew their hordes large, enough to attract dragons, who ate the dwarves and their precious rings.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Finally, in the hands of men, ever the corruptible species, the rings worked as expected.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Sauron controlled their minds and, as mortals, they valued their lives the most, which the rings stretched for thousands of years.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Stretched so thin, the men turned into invisible wraiths.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Anyway, these domination plans don't go unnoticed. There's a big war, Sauron is defeated and fades, and the One Ring is lost.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
But the One Ring is tricksy. It has a mind of its own and wants to get back to Sauron, which brings us back to its powers.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
First, the ring tempts everyone, well, almost everyone, with promises that, yes, this little ring can be a mighty weapon or a tool to reshape the world.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
And gosh, don't you just look like the best guy to use it. Let's go vanquish the powerful demigod who lives over there to get started, shall we? Hmm?

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
This is why the hobbits made great ring bearers, because they're pretty happy with the way things are and don't aspire to greatness.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Of course, there's Gollum, who started out as a hobbit, but all things considered, he held out pretty well for a couple hundred years.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Set the ring on the desk of most men and they wouldn't be able to finish their coffee before heading to Mordor to rule the world and do it right this time.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
It's worth considering that the One Ring's promises are just lies, that no one could really overthrow Sauron with it.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
The ring only wants to trick its wearer to get found, which brings us to invisibility.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Which, outside the minds of characters, is the only tangible power the ring displays for everyone else.

03:32.000 --> 03:42.000
Invisibility seems great, but while you're hiding from that troll, you shine like a beacon in the unseen world, where the also-invisible ringwraiths can easily spot you.

03:42.000 --> 03:51.000
In summary, the One Ring, A, turns you invisible in the most unhelpful manner, B, is probably filled with lies, because C, it's part of Sauron and works for him.

03:51.000 --> 04:00.000
He's so connected to it that its destruction ends him for good, but the formula also intertwines the One Ring with all the rest, and so when it fails, so do they.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
This is why the elves are so somber.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Victory over Sauron also means that the rings won't preserve their kingdoms anymore and all will diminish.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
These books are the end of the Age of Magic and the beginning of the Age of Men.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
