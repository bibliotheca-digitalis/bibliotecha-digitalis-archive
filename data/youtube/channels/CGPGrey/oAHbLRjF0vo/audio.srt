1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
What's the fastest way to board an airplane?

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,920
I mean, you can't just throw open the gates like funneling cattle into a chute.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,120
That's not for us.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,680
We're primates, after all.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,240
So let's put our monkey brains to work to tackle this cue, which is what boarding groups

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
do.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,360
Prioritize plainly packing primates precisely.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Primarily.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,120
Okay, we have a suggestion.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,080
Pour people into the plane back to front.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,980
This is an intuitive solution to fill a cylinder.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,140
But there's almost a law of the universe that solutions which are the first thing you think

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,320
of and look sensible and are easy to implement are often terrible, ineffective solutions

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,280
once implemented will drag on civilization forever.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Cough.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,540
Voting systems cough.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,680
So it should come as no surprise that this method is not good.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,000
And also what most airlines use to board their planes.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,080
Let's watch it in action.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,000
The first boarding group walks to the back of the plane.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,720
Everything is smooth, right until the first to go reaches their row and starts to stow.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,120
So slow.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,800
And for passenger two, while their seat is in view, there's nothing to do.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,920
The aisle's one cue.

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,240
We're all cannot but stew stuck like glue until this guy's through.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,280
Phew.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
It's bags.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,760
Bags cause most of the delay boarding a flight.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Like with this.

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,000
A full stop stow.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,820
When it happens, everyone boarding the plane within and without must wait until one person

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,100
finishes stowing their bag.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
Can you feel it?

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,120
The aggregate lost seconds of human life piling up like a bounty for a delighted reaper.

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,360
Of course you can.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
You can feel it with every bag.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
Uh, what was I saying?

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Right.

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,200
Back to front boarding groups have a lot of full stop stows and very few of what you want.

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Pullaways and parallels and parallels and pullaways.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Pullaways turn one cue into two and parallels decrease total bag stow time and are super

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
satisfying.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,240
The rare triple partner parallel invoking a double high five at the sheer pleasure of

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,960
its efficiency.

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,880
But loading back to front lets few of these happen.

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,200
Now say you weren't just not good at designing boarding groups, but you were malicious and

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,920
wanted to maximize the amount of human life wasted on a flight.

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,900
What would you do?

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,180
Not back to front, but front to back.

50
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,280
The smaller the boarding group, the better.

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,740
This makes almost every tedious shuffle forward result in a full stop stow because most of

52
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,620
the line waits by rows already full or outside the plane.

53
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
Look familiar?

54
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,020
This is where we acknowledge the class structure of airplanes.

55
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,420
Real planes look like this and first class boards first, front to back before the pro

56
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,700
economy file in back to front.

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,660
So excluding pre-boarding, all airlines start with a little of the slowest boarding method

58
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,660
you could intentionally design.

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,180
Now obviously this video will soon reveal faster boarding procedures, and you will wonder

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,680
why don't airlines use the faster methods?

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,140
One possible answer is economic incentives.

62
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,660
First class pays for perks, sometimes breathtaking perks for breathtaking amounts.

63
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,820
And boarding first is one of them.

64
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,220
Also airlines give everyone loyalty points that move you up the class structure the more

65
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,900
you fly with that airline.

66
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,140
Which gives airlines another good reason to group people and probably helps explain why

67
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:31,140
they switched away from the older, faster method you won't believe they used to use.

68
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,860
Doing nothing and having people board the flight in whatever order they show up to get

69
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,800
their assigned seat is faster than organizing tidy boarding groups.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,740
This is because random people are spread, well, randomly, increasing the chances of

71
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,140
pullaways and parallels, unlike the more orderly methods airlines have switched to.

72
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,380
Man, it's always frustrating to know that to literally have done nothing would be faster

73
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,220
than the something that is done.

74
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,580
But surely there's a better boarding group order to be found if we can just subtract

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,340
malice and add thinking to this problem.

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,860
Ah, three groups.

77
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,100
Window, middle, aisle, in that order.

78
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,820
This is really the same as doing random thrice, one for each column of the craft, but the

79
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,860
reason it's a smidge faster is because it eliminates the other source of boarding delay.

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
Seat shuffles.

81
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,860
When people board randomly, seat shuffling is going to happen a bunch, and when people

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,700
spill into the aisle, it slows the queue.

83
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,200
Ordering everyone by window, middle, aisle ensures a seat shuffle will never happen.

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,420
This seems like it should be a big improvement, but when you simulate boarding an aircraft

85
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,660
with a ton of real math rather than just animating it in a dramatically simplified fashion, or

86
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,220
do actual experiments, the seat shuffle just isn't a big deal compared to bag stowage.

87
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,860
People wrangling their one bag that won't possibly fit, or trying to get on board with

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,020
three bags because they don't think the rules should apply to them, who then also fiddle

89
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,820
around with getting their laptops out after stowing them, those kinds of delays count

90
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,900
for much more.

91
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,780
So window, middle, aisle is maybe a smidge faster than random, which is good, and some

92
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,220
airlines use this method, which gets their planes turned around faster than back to front

93
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,860
while still giving them boarding groups to play games with.

94
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,740
The vast majority of airlines use either back to front or window, middle, aisle, so

95
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,020
keep an eye out next time you're boarding a flight, or which is happening to you.

96
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,360
But can we go farther, leaving the real world with its class systems and people and untidiness

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,620
and smells ascending to the platonic plane of physics, where cows are spheres and people

98
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,900
cellular automaton who will execute instructions perfectly?

99
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,520
Here in the Celestia, what is the theoretically fastest way to board a plane?

100
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,960
On this level, here is what's possible.

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,440
To achieve this ballet, there are no boarding groups, but everyone stands in an exact order.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,840
Back to front, in alternating rows, on alternating sides, windows in.

103
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,160
This maximizes pullaways and parallels, pristinely packing people in a pinch.

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,760
Witnessing such glory is too much for mortal minds to bear for long, so we are forced to

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,680
descend back down into the meat world.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,080
The cacophony, the smell, where we must stuff monkeys into a tube, monkeys with families

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,240
where separating their young invites chaos and cleanup, where economic incentives divide

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,880
to profit, and where, even at their best, the human inability to follow instructions

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,200
is breathtaking.

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:45,840
Here, people upon seeing boarding group 123 would flip the hell out, let alone the impossibility

111
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,760
of trying to get them to stand in line in order, and where, even if faster, like watching

112
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,920
seconds of a clock, people would complain it was slower.

113
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Such gifts we were not meant to have.

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,560
But is there a way we can modify this perfection to improve our lot on this plane?

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Yes.

116
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,440
Instead of exact order, boarding group the first would be all one side of the plane in

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
every other row.

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Boarding group the second, the other side, then back, and back again.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
One, two, three, four.

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,720
We can't ask people for more.

121
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,080
This shadow of the perfect method has a chance of working in the real world, with benefits

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,780
like letting humans with families and friends board together, giving airlines boarding groups

123
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,240
they can still play with, and still being faster than the current methods.

124
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,520
Reaching for perfection, we will always come up short.

125
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,760
But perhaps we can manage to get closer in the process.

126
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,960
Oh, before you go, let me leave you with an annoying thought.

127
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,720
You know how boarding a flight from front to back by row is the slowest possible method?

128
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
The Reaper method?

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,200
Well, after your flight, when the plane pulls into the gate, and everyone ignores the flight

130
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,720
attendant's admonishment to wait until the fastened seatbelt is off to grab their bag,

131
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,640
and the door opens, how do we deplane?

132
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
That's right.

133
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,260
Front to back, row by row.

134
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,760
No slower could we go.

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
TICK TICK TICK
