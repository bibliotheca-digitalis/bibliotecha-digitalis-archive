00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
What's the fastest way to board an airplane?

00:08.840 --> 00:12.920
I mean, you can't just throw open the gates like funneling cattle into a chute.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.120
That's not for us.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.680
We're primates, after all.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.240
So let's put our monkey brains to work to tackle this cue, which is what boarding groups

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
do.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.360
Prioritize plainly packing primates precisely.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.360
Primarily.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.120
Okay, we have a suggestion.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.080
Pour people into the plane back to front.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.980
This is an intuitive solution to fill a cylinder.

00:31.980 --> 00:36.140
But there's almost a law of the universe that solutions which are the first thing you think

00:36.140 --> 00:42.320
of and look sensible and are easy to implement are often terrible, ineffective solutions

00:42.320 --> 00:46.280
once implemented will drag on civilization forever.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
Cough.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.540
Voting systems cough.

00:49.540 --> 00:53.680
So it should come as no surprise that this method is not good.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.000
And also what most airlines use to board their planes.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.080
Let's watch it in action.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.000
The first boarding group walks to the back of the plane.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.720
Everything is smooth, right until the first to go reaches their row and starts to stow.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.120
So slow.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.800
And for passenger two, while their seat is in view, there's nothing to do.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.920
The aisle's one cue.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.240
We're all cannot but stew stuck like glue until this guy's through.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.280
Phew.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.640
It's bags.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.760
Bags cause most of the delay boarding a flight.

01:21.760 --> 01:22.760
Like with this.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.000
A full stop stow.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.820
When it happens, everyone boarding the plane within and without must wait until one person

01:29.820 --> 01:32.100
finishes stowing their bag.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.100
Can you feel it?

01:33.100 --> 01:38.120
The aggregate lost seconds of human life piling up like a bounty for a delighted reaper.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.360
Of course you can.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.600
You can feel it with every bag.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.280
Uh, what was I saying?

01:43.280 --> 01:44.280
Right.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.200
Back to front boarding groups have a lot of full stop stows and very few of what you want.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.000
Pullaways and parallels and parallels and pullaways.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.280
Pullaways turn one cue into two and parallels decrease total bag stow time and are super

01:57.280 --> 01:58.280
satisfying.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.240
The rare triple partner parallel invoking a double high five at the sheer pleasure of

02:02.240 --> 02:03.960
its efficiency.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.880
But loading back to front lets few of these happen.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.200
Now say you weren't just not good at designing boarding groups, but you were malicious and

02:12.200 --> 02:16.920
wanted to maximize the amount of human life wasted on a flight.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.900
What would you do?

02:20.900 --> 02:23.180
Not back to front, but front to back.

02:23.180 --> 02:25.280
The smaller the boarding group, the better.

02:25.280 --> 02:30.740
This makes almost every tedious shuffle forward result in a full stop stow because most of

02:30.740 --> 02:35.620
the line waits by rows already full or outside the plane.

02:35.620 --> 02:36.620
Look familiar?

02:36.620 --> 02:40.020
This is where we acknowledge the class structure of airplanes.

02:40.020 --> 02:44.420
Real planes look like this and first class boards first, front to back before the pro

02:44.420 --> 02:46.700
economy file in back to front.

02:46.700 --> 02:51.660
So excluding pre-boarding, all airlines start with a little of the slowest boarding method

02:51.660 --> 02:53.660
you could intentionally design.

02:53.660 --> 02:58.180
Now obviously this video will soon reveal faster boarding procedures, and you will wonder

02:58.180 --> 03:00.680
why don't airlines use the faster methods?

03:00.680 --> 03:04.140
One possible answer is economic incentives.

03:04.140 --> 03:08.660
First class pays for perks, sometimes breathtaking perks for breathtaking amounts.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.820
And boarding first is one of them.

03:10.820 --> 03:15.220
Also airlines give everyone loyalty points that move you up the class structure the more

03:15.220 --> 03:16.900
you fly with that airline.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.140
Which gives airlines another good reason to group people and probably helps explain why

03:21.140 --> 03:31.140
they switched away from the older, faster method you won't believe they used to use.

03:31.140 --> 03:34.860
Doing nothing and having people board the flight in whatever order they show up to get

03:34.860 --> 03:38.800
their assigned seat is faster than organizing tidy boarding groups.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.740
This is because random people are spread, well, randomly, increasing the chances of

03:42.740 --> 03:47.140
pullaways and parallels, unlike the more orderly methods airlines have switched to.

03:47.140 --> 03:51.380
Man, it's always frustrating to know that to literally have done nothing would be faster

03:51.380 --> 03:53.220
than the something that is done.

03:53.220 --> 03:57.580
But surely there's a better boarding group order to be found if we can just subtract

03:57.580 --> 04:00.340
malice and add thinking to this problem.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.860
Ah, three groups.

04:01.860 --> 04:04.100
Window, middle, aisle, in that order.

04:04.100 --> 04:08.820
This is really the same as doing random thrice, one for each column of the craft, but the

04:08.820 --> 04:13.860
reason it's a smidge faster is because it eliminates the other source of boarding delay.

04:13.860 --> 04:14.860
Seat shuffles.

04:14.860 --> 04:18.860
When people board randomly, seat shuffling is going to happen a bunch, and when people

04:18.860 --> 04:21.700
spill into the aisle, it slows the queue.

04:21.700 --> 04:26.200
Ordering everyone by window, middle, aisle ensures a seat shuffle will never happen.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.420
This seems like it should be a big improvement, but when you simulate boarding an aircraft

04:30.420 --> 04:34.660
with a ton of real math rather than just animating it in a dramatically simplified fashion, or

04:34.660 --> 04:40.220
do actual experiments, the seat shuffle just isn't a big deal compared to bag stowage.

04:40.220 --> 04:44.860
People wrangling their one bag that won't possibly fit, or trying to get on board with

04:44.860 --> 04:48.020
three bags because they don't think the rules should apply to them, who then also fiddle

04:48.020 --> 04:51.820
around with getting their laptops out after stowing them, those kinds of delays count

04:51.820 --> 04:52.900
for much more.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.780
So window, middle, aisle is maybe a smidge faster than random, which is good, and some

04:56.780 --> 05:01.220
airlines use this method, which gets their planes turned around faster than back to front

05:01.220 --> 05:03.860
while still giving them boarding groups to play games with.

05:03.860 --> 05:08.740
The vast majority of airlines use either back to front or window, middle, aisle, so

05:08.740 --> 05:13.020
keep an eye out next time you're boarding a flight, or which is happening to you.

05:13.020 --> 05:18.360
But can we go farther, leaving the real world with its class systems and people and untidiness

05:18.360 --> 05:23.620
and smells ascending to the platonic plane of physics, where cows are spheres and people

05:23.620 --> 05:26.900
cellular automaton who will execute instructions perfectly?

05:26.900 --> 05:32.520
Here in the Celestia, what is the theoretically fastest way to board a plane?

05:32.520 --> 05:34.960
On this level, here is what's possible.

05:52.840 --> 05:58.440
To achieve this ballet, there are no boarding groups, but everyone stands in an exact order.

05:58.440 --> 06:03.840
Back to front, in alternating rows, on alternating sides, windows in.

06:03.840 --> 06:09.160
This maximizes pullaways and parallels, pristinely packing people in a pinch.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.760
Witnessing such glory is too much for mortal minds to bear for long, so we are forced to

06:13.760 --> 06:16.680
descend back down into the meat world.

06:16.680 --> 06:23.080
The cacophony, the smell, where we must stuff monkeys into a tube, monkeys with families

06:23.080 --> 06:28.240
where separating their young invites chaos and cleanup, where economic incentives divide

06:28.240 --> 06:33.880
to profit, and where, even at their best, the human inability to follow instructions

06:33.880 --> 06:36.200
is breathtaking.

06:36.200 --> 06:45.840
Here, people upon seeing boarding group 123 would flip the hell out, let alone the impossibility

06:45.840 --> 06:50.760
of trying to get them to stand in line in order, and where, even if faster, like watching

06:50.760 --> 06:55.920
seconds of a clock, people would complain it was slower.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.160
Such gifts we were not meant to have.

06:58.160 --> 07:03.560
But is there a way we can modify this perfection to improve our lot on this plane?

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
Yes.

07:04.560 --> 07:09.440
Instead of exact order, boarding group the first would be all one side of the plane in

07:09.440 --> 07:10.800
every other row.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.600
Boarding group the second, the other side, then back, and back again.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
One, two, three, four.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.720
We can't ask people for more.

07:18.720 --> 07:24.080
This shadow of the perfect method has a chance of working in the real world, with benefits

07:24.080 --> 07:28.780
like letting humans with families and friends board together, giving airlines boarding groups

07:28.780 --> 07:33.240
they can still play with, and still being faster than the current methods.

07:33.240 --> 07:36.520
Reaching for perfection, we will always come up short.

07:36.520 --> 07:42.760
But perhaps we can manage to get closer in the process.

07:42.760 --> 07:47.960
Oh, before you go, let me leave you with an annoying thought.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.720
You know how boarding a flight from front to back by row is the slowest possible method?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.080
The Reaper method?

07:54.080 --> 07:59.200
Well, after your flight, when the plane pulls into the gate, and everyone ignores the flight

07:59.200 --> 08:03.720
attendant's admonishment to wait until the fastened seatbelt is off to grab their bag,

08:03.720 --> 08:06.640
and the door opens, how do we deplane?

08:06.640 --> 08:07.640
That's right.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.260
Front to back, row by row.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.760
No slower could we go.

08:22.720 --> 08:27.720
TICK TICK TICK
