0	8840	What's the fastest way to board an airplane?
8840	12920	I mean, you can't just throw open the gates like funneling cattle into a chute.
12920	14120	That's not for us.
14120	15680	We're primates, after all.
15680	20240	So let's put our monkey brains to work to tackle this cue, which is what boarding groups
20240	21240	do.
21240	23360	Prioritize plainly packing primates precisely.
23360	24360	Primarily.
24360	26120	Okay, we have a suggestion.
26120	29080	Pour people into the plane back to front.
29080	31980	This is an intuitive solution to fill a cylinder.
31980	36140	But there's almost a law of the universe that solutions which are the first thing you think
36140	42320	of and look sensible and are easy to implement are often terrible, ineffective solutions
42320	46280	once implemented will drag on civilization forever.
46280	47280	Cough.
47280	49540	Voting systems cough.
49540	53680	So it should come as no surprise that this method is not good.
53680	57000	And also what most airlines use to board their planes.
57000	58080	Let's watch it in action.
58080	61000	The first boarding group walks to the back of the plane.
61000	65720	Everything is smooth, right until the first to go reaches their row and starts to stow.
65720	67120	So slow.
67120	70800	And for passenger two, while their seat is in view, there's nothing to do.
70800	71920	The aisle's one cue.
71920	76240	We're all cannot but stew stuck like glue until this guy's through.
76240	77280	Phew.
77280	78640	It's bags.
78640	81760	Bags cause most of the delay boarding a flight.
81760	82760	Like with this.
82760	84000	A full stop stow.
84000	89820	When it happens, everyone boarding the plane within and without must wait until one person
89820	92100	finishes stowing their bag.
92100	93100	Can you feel it?
93100	98120	The aggregate lost seconds of human life piling up like a bounty for a delighted reaper.
98120	99360	Of course you can.
99360	101600	You can feel it with every bag.
101600	103280	Uh, what was I saying?
103280	104280	Right.
104280	109200	Back to front boarding groups have a lot of full stop stows and very few of what you want.
109200	112000	Pullaways and parallels and parallels and pullaways.
112000	117280	Pullaways turn one cue into two and parallels decrease total bag stow time and are super
117280	118280	satisfying.
118280	122240	The rare triple partner parallel invoking a double high five at the sheer pleasure of
122240	123960	its efficiency.
123960	126880	But loading back to front lets few of these happen.
126880	132200	Now say you weren't just not good at designing boarding groups, but you were malicious and
132200	136920	wanted to maximize the amount of human life wasted on a flight.
136920	140900	What would you do?
140900	143180	Not back to front, but front to back.
143180	145280	The smaller the boarding group, the better.
145280	150740	This makes almost every tedious shuffle forward result in a full stop stow because most of
150740	155620	the line waits by rows already full or outside the plane.
155620	156620	Look familiar?
156620	160020	This is where we acknowledge the class structure of airplanes.
160020	164420	Real planes look like this and first class boards first, front to back before the pro
164420	166700	economy file in back to front.
166700	171660	So excluding pre-boarding, all airlines start with a little of the slowest boarding method
171660	173660	you could intentionally design.
173660	178180	Now obviously this video will soon reveal faster boarding procedures, and you will wonder
178180	180680	why don't airlines use the faster methods?
180680	184140	One possible answer is economic incentives.
184140	188660	First class pays for perks, sometimes breathtaking perks for breathtaking amounts.
188660	190820	And boarding first is one of them.
190820	195220	Also airlines give everyone loyalty points that move you up the class structure the more
195220	196900	you fly with that airline.
196900	201140	Which gives airlines another good reason to group people and probably helps explain why
201140	211140	they switched away from the older, faster method you won't believe they used to use.
211140	214860	Doing nothing and having people board the flight in whatever order they show up to get
214860	218800	their assigned seat is faster than organizing tidy boarding groups.
218800	222740	This is because random people are spread, well, randomly, increasing the chances of
222740	227140	pullaways and parallels, unlike the more orderly methods airlines have switched to.
227140	231380	Man, it's always frustrating to know that to literally have done nothing would be faster
231380	233220	than the something that is done.
233220	237580	But surely there's a better boarding group order to be found if we can just subtract
237580	240340	malice and add thinking to this problem.
240340	241860	Ah, three groups.
241860	244100	Window, middle, aisle, in that order.
244100	248820	This is really the same as doing random thrice, one for each column of the craft, but the
248820	253860	reason it's a smidge faster is because it eliminates the other source of boarding delay.
253860	254860	Seat shuffles.
254860	258860	When people board randomly, seat shuffling is going to happen a bunch, and when people
258860	261700	spill into the aisle, it slows the queue.
261700	266200	Ordering everyone by window, middle, aisle ensures a seat shuffle will never happen.
266200	270420	This seems like it should be a big improvement, but when you simulate boarding an aircraft
270420	274660	with a ton of real math rather than just animating it in a dramatically simplified fashion, or
274660	280220	do actual experiments, the seat shuffle just isn't a big deal compared to bag stowage.
280220	284860	People wrangling their one bag that won't possibly fit, or trying to get on board with
284860	288020	three bags because they don't think the rules should apply to them, who then also fiddle
288020	291820	around with getting their laptops out after stowing them, those kinds of delays count
291820	292900	for much more.
292900	296780	So window, middle, aisle is maybe a smidge faster than random, which is good, and some
296780	301220	airlines use this method, which gets their planes turned around faster than back to front
301220	303860	while still giving them boarding groups to play games with.
303860	308740	The vast majority of airlines use either back to front or window, middle, aisle, so
308740	313020	keep an eye out next time you're boarding a flight, or which is happening to you.
313020	318360	But can we go farther, leaving the real world with its class systems and people and untidiness
318360	323620	and smells ascending to the platonic plane of physics, where cows are spheres and people
323620	326900	cellular automaton who will execute instructions perfectly?
326900	332520	Here in the Celestia, what is the theoretically fastest way to board a plane?
332520	334960	On this level, here is what's possible.
352840	358440	To achieve this ballet, there are no boarding groups, but everyone stands in an exact order.
358440	363840	Back to front, in alternating rows, on alternating sides, windows in.
363840	369160	This maximizes pullaways and parallels, pristinely packing people in a pinch.
369160	373760	Witnessing such glory is too much for mortal minds to bear for long, so we are forced to
373760	376680	descend back down into the meat world.
376680	383080	The cacophony, the smell, where we must stuff monkeys into a tube, monkeys with families
383080	388240	where separating their young invites chaos and cleanup, where economic incentives divide
388240	393880	to profit, and where, even at their best, the human inability to follow instructions
393880	396200	is breathtaking.
396200	405840	Here, people upon seeing boarding group 123 would flip the hell out, let alone the impossibility
405840	410760	of trying to get them to stand in line in order, and where, even if faster, like watching
410760	415920	seconds of a clock, people would complain it was slower.
415920	418160	Such gifts we were not meant to have.
418160	423560	But is there a way we can modify this perfection to improve our lot on this plane?
423560	424560	Yes.
424560	429440	Instead of exact order, boarding group the first would be all one side of the plane in
429440	430800	every other row.
430800	434600	Boarding group the second, the other side, then back, and back again.
434600	436600	One, two, three, four.
436600	438720	We can't ask people for more.
438720	444080	This shadow of the perfect method has a chance of working in the real world, with benefits
444080	448780	like letting humans with families and friends board together, giving airlines boarding groups
448780	453240	they can still play with, and still being faster than the current methods.
453240	456520	Reaching for perfection, we will always come up short.
456520	462760	But perhaps we can manage to get closer in the process.
462760	467960	Oh, before you go, let me leave you with an annoying thought.
467960	472720	You know how boarding a flight from front to back by row is the slowest possible method?
472720	474080	The Reaper method?
474080	479200	Well, after your flight, when the plane pulls into the gate, and everyone ignores the flight
479200	483720	attendant's admonishment to wait until the fastened seatbelt is off to grab their bag,
483720	486640	and the door opens, how do we deplane?
486640	487640	That's right.
487640	490260	Front to back, row by row.
490260	491760	No slower could we go.
502720	507720	TICK TICK TICK
