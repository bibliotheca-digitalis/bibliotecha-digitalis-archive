WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
Well, that doesn't look good.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.600
Hello Lucy Liu.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.120
I'm in North Carolina.

00:12.120 --> 00:17.640
It's the start of what is going to be five long weeks of business travel and business

00:17.640 --> 00:18.640
meetings.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.440
I'm trying to get better at business meetings.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.520
Also while I'm here, I'm setting for myself the goal of escaping from America not fatter

00:26.520 --> 00:31.360
than I arrived because I've fallen off the health bandwagon a bit lately and I really

00:31.360 --> 00:36.040
don't want to make things worse but that might be impossible given that in America the streets

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
are paved with donuts.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.520
But I'm going to try and right now that's future Grey's problem.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.760
Current Grey is on the porch with a dog visiting family so no more vlogging and let's skip

00:46.760 --> 00:48.800
to Denver, Colorado.

00:48.800 --> 00:55.080
Just stopping off to get some coffee and use the restroom and tornado shelter and eat bad

00:55.080 --> 01:00.040
food strangely.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.080
More details later.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.780
On to San Jose, California just south of San Francisco.

01:04.780 --> 01:09.020
Work travel is never fun but it's extra not fun when you arrive at the hotel to find out

01:09.020 --> 01:12.640
that they don't have your room that you booked months ago.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.800
The reservation they have but not the room.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.840
Suspiciously it seems many people who booked the hotel rooms at a super cheap price before

01:19.840 --> 01:24.560
the hotels realized that WWDC had changed locations to a new city.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.280
Because people don't have rooms the rooms have been re-rented at a higher price.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.280
So what happens to the people who do have a reservation?

01:31.280 --> 01:35.000
Why conveniently they put you in a hotel on the other side of the city.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.680
A hotel with the douchiest privacy please sign I've ever seen.

01:39.680 --> 01:45.720
But I didn't fly across an ocean and a continent to be 45 minutes away from all of the reasons

01:45.720 --> 01:46.760
that I'm here.

01:46.760 --> 01:52.420
So I was rather firm with the hotel and suddenly like magic they did have a free upgrade to

01:52.420 --> 01:57.100
a better room but not for tonight so I still have to be at this place and I can't set up

01:57.100 --> 02:01.180
any of my work and it won't be until I drive back tomorrow morning that I can actually

02:01.180 --> 02:06.900
get started on the reasons that I'm here.

02:06.900 --> 02:12.740
In fairness the apology suite is quite nice and it comes with an apology letter and apology

02:12.740 --> 02:18.020
chocolate that I can't eat because I must escape from America not fatter.

02:18.020 --> 02:44.660
Cool pro tip you can have stuff delivered to the hotel so you don't have to pack it.

02:44.660 --> 02:49.220
This is only half the boxes I have to unpack and I didn't unpack all the boxes in the boxes

02:49.220 --> 02:53.980
but as I switched hotels this morning I'm running out of time before WWDC begins so

02:53.980 --> 02:57.020
I need to get out of here.

02:57.020 --> 03:01.620
WWDC is a conference where Apple brings developers from the wide world to announce new features

03:01.620 --> 03:06.340
of their software so programmers can implement them.

03:06.340 --> 03:08.820
A ticket inside is a front row to the future.

03:08.820 --> 03:09.980
I don't have a ticket.

03:09.980 --> 03:19.780
I've got a hotel room and a wishlist which is far more funny for crowd reactions anyway.

03:19.780 --> 03:27.380
And fooling around on Twitter during the boring parts.

03:27.380 --> 03:36.940
Keynote's over now it's time to set up my mobile office.

03:36.940 --> 03:44.300
Watch some technical talks.

03:44.300 --> 03:52.700
Attend tech podcasts to discuss the tech and sometimes with singalongs.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.100
Which brings us to Why Am I Here?

03:55.100 --> 04:00.140
At the end of WWDC it's to record a podcast about WWDC.

04:00.140 --> 04:04.300
The podcast is called Cortex on a network called Relay and that's another reason that

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
I'm here.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.140
There's a big Relay Listener Meetup that I'm going to.

04:09.140 --> 04:13.700
Pascrae didn't film anything at the event but to be fair to him he was running on low

04:13.700 --> 04:15.740
power mode at that point.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.980
I really find jet lag so frustrating.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.380
On this trip I'm trying to acclimatize to West Coast time.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.860
I was out last night at the Relay podcast meetup.

04:26.860 --> 04:30.580
I was just talking to people and then pow I was hit with that.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.420
I'm going to fall asleep immediately feeling.

04:34.420 --> 04:41.220
So I come back to the hotel to get a good night's sleep but no of course here I am.

04:41.220 --> 04:42.220
It's four in the morning.

04:42.220 --> 04:48.300
I know I'm just going to be awake for a while like a zombie.

04:48.300 --> 04:55.580
Thanks jet lag.

04:55.580 --> 05:03.680
I was on my way to go find some coffee but I think this is what I need to do today.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.860
This is goal number one but later coffee first.

05:07.860 --> 05:12.020
Alright time to do this.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.680
I tried to do some fancy camera work but then this happened so forget that.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.660
No more recording in gyms while I'm doing weight stuff.

05:18.660 --> 05:24.900
It feels super weird to vlog then anyway.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.420
America is a place where you can really double down on your eating mistakes.

05:28.420 --> 05:34.200
I really want to avoid that so my plan while I'm here is just to cut out as many carbohydrates

05:34.200 --> 05:35.880
as I can from my diet.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.140
This means no pancakes, no bread, no pastas, no pizza, no crackers.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.900
Normally the kind of stuff that I would eat an enormous amount of when I'm under a lot

05:43.900 --> 05:46.060
of pressure and doing a lot of work.

05:46.060 --> 05:50.000
And since I'm also traveling at the same time it's kind of doubly hard but it is possible

05:50.000 --> 05:53.140
to do if you can eat the eggs but not the muffin.

05:53.140 --> 05:56.100
So I'm going to the supermarket to load up on all the kinds of things that I'm going

05:56.100 --> 05:57.560
to be eating lots of.

05:57.560 --> 06:02.380
Meat and cheese and eggs and emergency almonds and emergency jerky.

06:02.380 --> 06:07.400
It's not fun and it's not what I want to do but this is the most simple and effective

06:07.400 --> 06:13.580
thing that I have found in the past for dropping or maintaining weight and if there's one thing

06:13.580 --> 06:17.380
I could use this summer it's a bit of simple.

06:17.380 --> 06:18.380
Thank you checkout robots.

06:18.380 --> 06:25.540
You don't ask any questions and I really appreciate you for that.

06:25.540 --> 06:29.480
Conferencing is mentally taxing but I find it helps to map the outlines of the day and

06:29.480 --> 06:33.280
try to specify what objectives for time well spent are.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.080
What I need to do, who I need to see, what sessions I should go to.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.160
And as a personal development point I'm trying to get better at meeting with interesting

06:40.160 --> 06:45.460
people while I'm business traveling and these conferences can be a crazy overlapping puzzle

06:45.460 --> 06:47.460
of everyone's schedules.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.940
Right now I'm on my way to a meeting with someone.

06:50.940 --> 06:55.640
The only time we can find for both of us that overlapped is while he's packing his bags

06:55.640 --> 06:56.640
to go.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.640
So that's where I'm headed.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.580
Alright, packing meeting over.

07:06.580 --> 07:11.220
On to more stuff.

07:11.220 --> 07:14.940
The no carbohydrates health plan is going pretty well so far but now during business

07:14.940 --> 07:19.940
meetings I'm the weirdo who's not eating the burger bun and has to explain why.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.940
Do I recognize the model of truck?

07:26.940 --> 07:27.940
I do not.

07:27.940 --> 07:31.660
I've been lucky enough to be invited out to see some interesting headquarters in the past

07:31.660 --> 07:34.180
including Dropbox and Facebook.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.820
This time it's Google with their, why is there a dinosaur over there?

07:37.820 --> 07:43.860
And this is a sad dystopian graveyard of Android's past.

07:43.860 --> 07:46.560
And office interior they really rather you didn't film.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.220
Then on to the computer history museum with so many buttons.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.960
I want to press them all.

07:51.960 --> 07:58.260
And remembered fun things long forgotten.

07:58.260 --> 08:13.180
And traumatic things long forgotten.

08:13.500 --> 08:17.500
And got totally distracted by seeing my first Tesla charger in real life.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
Oh god.

08:19.500 --> 08:24.620
Tesla's, Tesla's as far as the eye can see.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.860
Oh, this is the X.

08:26.860 --> 08:37.660
I'm pretty tired and I really don't want to, it's been a long day but I'm going to the

08:37.660 --> 08:38.660
gym.

08:39.140 --> 08:44.420
And everywhere you go in America, screens, screens, screens.

08:44.420 --> 08:49.740
But you know what, thank you.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.740
But no thank you.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.780
Alright, I'm doing this.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.660
Pretty pleased about that.

08:58.660 --> 09:06.060
I had just, I really didn't want to do it, but I'd only just barely started a streak

09:06.060 --> 09:11.740
of exercising, so I wasn't going to quit on the third day.

09:11.740 --> 09:25.820
But yeah, not a thing that I wanted to do, but I'm very glad it's done, and now it's

09:26.660 --> 09:31.660
It's shower time.

09:31.660 --> 09:59.860
I've yet to be at a conference that doesn't feel like it's just one day too long, and

09:59.860 --> 10:01.740
this is the last day.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.900
The big responsibility today is to record Cortex.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.300
But before that happens I want to try to fit in just a little bit of exercise.

10:08.300 --> 10:14.260
I'm going to get my bicycling in while I prepare for Cortex.

10:14.260 --> 10:24.260
So I've got the bike, it looks like on the map there's a park along the Guadalupe River.

10:24.260 --> 10:29.940
So I'm taking the bike there, and I'm going to go for a little bit of a ride.

10:29.940 --> 10:39.980
I've gotten into the habit of not listening to music while I do aerobic exercise.

10:39.980 --> 10:47.420
It makes exercising a good time to think, and like today I'm going to be combining the

10:47.420 --> 10:51.140
exercise with preparing for Cortex.

10:51.140 --> 10:54.540
So I've taken a look at the show notes, I've loaded them up in my head, I'm going to go

10:54.540 --> 11:00.540
for a little bike ride and think about what I'm going to talk about on Cortex today.

11:00.540 --> 11:06.500
Just as soon as I can figure out how to get down into the park.

11:06.500 --> 11:12.020
Now it's time to attach the GoPro.

11:12.020 --> 11:17.300
Perfect.

11:47.300 --> 11:55.340
Thanks little buddy, that was way better than cycling indoors.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.020
Time for shower and podcast.

11:58.020 --> 12:03.780
Oh no, this is the worst.

12:03.780 --> 12:10.180
I have to hide now for a little while, I'm going to be late to the podcast.

12:10.180 --> 12:20.340
Can't do a podcast unless you have enough coffee to get through a podcast.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.140
I'm bringing the coffee.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.140
I finally did it.

12:23.140 --> 12:24.140
What did you do?

12:24.140 --> 12:25.540
We're in the same place.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.100
We're working on something together in the same place.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.900
We're at WWDC again.

12:30.900 --> 12:31.900
We are.

12:31.900 --> 12:36.620
But last year you made me record in a hotel room, and you were in your hotel room, and

12:36.620 --> 12:37.620
we used Skype.

12:37.620 --> 12:38.620
Yes, that's true.

12:38.620 --> 12:42.740
This year you suggested, why don't we record in person?

12:42.740 --> 12:43.820
I didn't suggest it.

12:43.820 --> 12:44.880
I feel like you did.

12:44.880 --> 12:50.380
You suggested it, and I agreed because I have a lot of audio equipment in my room right

12:50.380 --> 12:52.860
now that I really didn't want to unbox.

12:52.860 --> 12:53.860
That makes sense.

12:53.860 --> 13:03.140
Okay, put the button on me.

13:03.140 --> 13:04.860
Everyone is gone.

13:04.860 --> 13:07.980
I'm still here because I need an extra day to prepare.

13:08.340 --> 13:12.620
There's a place I need to get to by a certain time, and it's a bit... it's going to end

13:12.620 --> 13:13.620
up being a bit involved.

13:13.620 --> 13:17.060
So I'm guessing this vlog, which I originally thought was just going to be a short thing

13:17.060 --> 13:22.820
at some conferences, is going to end up being a much longer thing, like two or three parts.

13:22.820 --> 13:23.820
I don't know.

13:23.820 --> 13:29.260
That's future Grey's editing problem.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.140
Now Grey's problem is packing.

13:32.140 --> 13:37.020
For suitcases and stuff, the rule is only bags go inside of suitcases, not things.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.140
Bags in suitcases.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.740
Things can go in the bags, not in the suitcase.

13:41.740 --> 13:46.740
Alright, I got the packing done way faster than expected because, of course, I realized

13:46.740 --> 13:48.220
I don't need to pack it well.

13:48.220 --> 13:52.740
I just need to get it all boxed up so I c**t right now.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.740
Faster than the SEC.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.740
To this point, anyway, with 19 home runs.

14:07.020 --> 14:15.020
I'm sure it looked the way on the camera, but holy hell.

14:32.020 --> 14:34.820
Let me hear the day before VidCon starts.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.220
The pre-conference feeling is nice.

14:37.220 --> 14:42.940
I always like being in places before the action happens, as it's being set up.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.780
It's the feeling of potential.

14:45.780 --> 14:53.180
All that potential of what could be before what actually happens empties you to the core.

14:53.180 --> 15:01.120
And this conference, this VidCon, is particularly draining because the longer you spend time

15:01.120 --> 15:05.720
near L.A., the more desaturated your life becomes.

15:05.720 --> 15:11.120
L.A. is a dementor in city form, but right now I'm still fresh.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.500
I like exploring.

15:12.500 --> 15:16.460
I like the feeling of solitude in places that should be full.

15:16.460 --> 15:20.120
It's peaceful, and it won't stay that way for long.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.120
It has begun.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.120
It has begun.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.120
Stay close, coffee.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.120
I need you now more than ever.

15:50.120 --> 16:07.120
I'm so exhausted, and these cookies are everywhere, depleting my willpower in all of the lounges.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.120
Everywhere, there aren't crowds.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.120
There are cookies.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.120
A cookie would feel so good right now.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.120
But I must resist.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.120
In case you're wondering, I stayed off of carbs during part two.

16:19.120 --> 16:27.120
It's been about three weeks so far without carbs, and this is the final hard stretch as VidCon is such an assault on the mind.

16:27.120 --> 16:31.120
And to cope with it, I've chosen poorly in years past.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.120
What?

16:32.120 --> 16:35.120
You overestimate the power of this. I don't understand why you think this is interesting.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.120
Brady's gonna want to see a snap from you.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.120
Okay.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.120
I'm making better choices this time.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
Thank you very much.

16:44.120 --> 16:50.120
But America really doesn't help when there's a pizza button on the phone and a sign for the pizza button.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.120
I think they really want me to eat pizza.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.120
But I'm going to stay strong.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.120
Only two weeks left to escape from America, not fatter.

17:15.120 --> 17:19.120
I feel like this place is the opposite of me.

17:30.120 --> 17:34.120
So much screaming and filming.

17:34.120 --> 17:48.120
Okay, so the question was, you guys with your cameras, everybody behind you can't see me.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.120
Amazing.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.120
There's people everywhere. Well, almost everywhere.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.120
Good luck with that.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.120
Good luck with that.

18:52.120 --> 18:59.120
Future Grey taking over here, as at this point past Grey was really pushed beyond his social limits.

18:59.120 --> 19:04.120
Suddenly there is no more talking to the camera. There's just simply no more talking.

19:04.120 --> 19:12.120
This first summer of Grey was exhausting beyond my ability to explain, but it was also a great and hugely successful trip.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.120
I wanted to try to have more meetings with people, and boy did I ever.

19:16.120 --> 19:28.120
But it was time to go. I needed a break, and there was a place that I wanted to go where I could just be quiet and not have to see people and not have to do anything and just recharge for a while.

19:29.120 --> 19:40.120
So that's where I went, and there is perhaps nothing more uplifting to the human soul than taking a flight out of LA to a place where you actually want to be.

19:40.120 --> 19:51.120
So I recharged for a while, I went back to North Carolina to see my family again, and then I returned home to London, and thus ended the summer of Grey.

19:51.120 --> 19:58.120
Oh right, I also came back not fatter.
