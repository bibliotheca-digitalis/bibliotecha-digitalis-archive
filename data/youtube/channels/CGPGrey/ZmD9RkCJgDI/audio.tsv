0	8720	Well, that doesn't look good.
8720	10600	Hello Lucy Liu.
10600	12120	I'm in North Carolina.
12120	17640	It's the start of what is going to be five long weeks of business travel and business
17640	18640	meetings.
18640	21440	I'm trying to get better at business meetings.
21440	26520	Also while I'm here, I'm setting for myself the goal of escaping from America not fatter
26520	31360	than I arrived because I've fallen off the health bandwagon a bit lately and I really
31360	36040	don't want to make things worse but that might be impossible given that in America the streets
36040	37040	are paved with donuts.
37040	41520	But I'm going to try and right now that's future Grey's problem.
41520	46760	Current Grey is on the porch with a dog visiting family so no more vlogging and let's skip
46760	48800	to Denver, Colorado.
48800	55080	Just stopping off to get some coffee and use the restroom and tornado shelter and eat bad
55080	60040	food strangely.
60040	61080	More details later.
61080	64780	On to San Jose, California just south of San Francisco.
64780	69020	Work travel is never fun but it's extra not fun when you arrive at the hotel to find out
69020	72640	that they don't have your room that you booked months ago.
72640	75800	The reservation they have but not the room.
75800	79840	Suspiciously it seems many people who booked the hotel rooms at a super cheap price before
79840	84560	the hotels realized that WWDC had changed locations to a new city.
84560	89280	Because people don't have rooms the rooms have been re-rented at a higher price.
89280	91280	So what happens to the people who do have a reservation?
91280	95000	Why conveniently they put you in a hotel on the other side of the city.
95000	99680	A hotel with the douchiest privacy please sign I've ever seen.
99680	105720	But I didn't fly across an ocean and a continent to be 45 minutes away from all of the reasons
105720	106760	that I'm here.
106760	112420	So I was rather firm with the hotel and suddenly like magic they did have a free upgrade to
112420	117100	a better room but not for tonight so I still have to be at this place and I can't set up
117100	121180	any of my work and it won't be until I drive back tomorrow morning that I can actually
121180	126900	get started on the reasons that I'm here.
126900	132740	In fairness the apology suite is quite nice and it comes with an apology letter and apology
132740	138020	chocolate that I can't eat because I must escape from America not fatter.
138020	164660	Cool pro tip you can have stuff delivered to the hotel so you don't have to pack it.
164660	169220	This is only half the boxes I have to unpack and I didn't unpack all the boxes in the boxes
169220	173980	but as I switched hotels this morning I'm running out of time before WWDC begins so
173980	177020	I need to get out of here.
177020	181620	WWDC is a conference where Apple brings developers from the wide world to announce new features
181620	186340	of their software so programmers can implement them.
186340	188820	A ticket inside is a front row to the future.
188820	189980	I don't have a ticket.
189980	199780	I've got a hotel room and a wishlist which is far more funny for crowd reactions anyway.
199780	207380	And fooling around on Twitter during the boring parts.
207380	216940	Keynote's over now it's time to set up my mobile office.
216940	224300	Watch some technical talks.
224300	232700	Attend tech podcasts to discuss the tech and sometimes with singalongs.
232700	235100	Which brings us to Why Am I Here?
235100	240140	At the end of WWDC it's to record a podcast about WWDC.
240140	244300	The podcast is called Cortex on a network called Relay and that's another reason that
244300	245300	I'm here.
245300	249140	There's a big Relay Listener Meetup that I'm going to.
249140	253700	Pascrae didn't film anything at the event but to be fair to him he was running on low
253700	255740	power mode at that point.
255740	258980	I really find jet lag so frustrating.
258980	262380	On this trip I'm trying to acclimatize to West Coast time.
262380	266860	I was out last night at the Relay podcast meetup.
266860	270580	I was just talking to people and then pow I was hit with that.
270580	274420	I'm going to fall asleep immediately feeling.
274420	281220	So I come back to the hotel to get a good night's sleep but no of course here I am.
281220	282220	It's four in the morning.
282220	288300	I know I'm just going to be awake for a while like a zombie.
288300	295580	Thanks jet lag.
295580	303680	I was on my way to go find some coffee but I think this is what I need to do today.
303680	307860	This is goal number one but later coffee first.
307860	312020	Alright time to do this.
312020	315680	I tried to do some fancy camera work but then this happened so forget that.
315680	318660	No more recording in gyms while I'm doing weight stuff.
318660	324900	It feels super weird to vlog then anyway.
324900	328420	America is a place where you can really double down on your eating mistakes.
328420	334200	I really want to avoid that so my plan while I'm here is just to cut out as many carbohydrates
334200	335880	as I can from my diet.
335880	340140	This means no pancakes, no bread, no pastas, no pizza, no crackers.
340140	343900	Normally the kind of stuff that I would eat an enormous amount of when I'm under a lot
343900	346060	of pressure and doing a lot of work.
346060	350000	And since I'm also traveling at the same time it's kind of doubly hard but it is possible
350000	353140	to do if you can eat the eggs but not the muffin.
353140	356100	So I'm going to the supermarket to load up on all the kinds of things that I'm going
356100	357560	to be eating lots of.
357560	362380	Meat and cheese and eggs and emergency almonds and emergency jerky.
362380	367400	It's not fun and it's not what I want to do but this is the most simple and effective
367400	373580	thing that I have found in the past for dropping or maintaining weight and if there's one thing
373580	377380	I could use this summer it's a bit of simple.
377380	378380	Thank you checkout robots.
378380	385540	You don't ask any questions and I really appreciate you for that.
385540	389480	Conferencing is mentally taxing but I find it helps to map the outlines of the day and
389480	393280	try to specify what objectives for time well spent are.
393280	397080	What I need to do, who I need to see, what sessions I should go to.
397080	400160	And as a personal development point I'm trying to get better at meeting with interesting
400160	405460	people while I'm business traveling and these conferences can be a crazy overlapping puzzle
405460	407460	of everyone's schedules.
407540	410940	Right now I'm on my way to a meeting with someone.
410940	415640	The only time we can find for both of us that overlapped is while he's packing his bags
415640	416640	to go.
416640	419640	So that's where I'm headed.
424640	426580	Alright, packing meeting over.
426580	431220	On to more stuff.
431220	434940	The no carbohydrates health plan is going pretty well so far but now during business
434940	439940	meetings I'm the weirdo who's not eating the burger bun and has to explain why.
444940	446940	Do I recognize the model of truck?
446940	447940	I do not.
447940	451660	I've been lucky enough to be invited out to see some interesting headquarters in the past
451660	454180	including Dropbox and Facebook.
454180	457820	This time it's Google with their, why is there a dinosaur over there?
457820	463860	And this is a sad dystopian graveyard of Android's past.
463860	466560	And office interior they really rather you didn't film.
466560	470220	Then on to the computer history museum with so many buttons.
470220	471960	I want to press them all.
471960	478260	And remembered fun things long forgotten.
478260	493180	And traumatic things long forgotten.
493500	497500	And got totally distracted by seeing my first Tesla charger in real life.
497500	499500	Oh god.
499500	504620	Tesla's, Tesla's as far as the eye can see.
504620	506860	Oh, this is the X.
506860	517660	I'm pretty tired and I really don't want to, it's been a long day but I'm going to the
517660	518660	gym.
519140	524420	And everywhere you go in America, screens, screens, screens.
524420	529740	But you know what, thank you.
529740	531740	But no thank you.
531740	536780	Alright, I'm doing this.
536780	538660	Pretty pleased about that.
538660	546060	I had just, I really didn't want to do it, but I'd only just barely started a streak
546060	551740	of exercising, so I wasn't going to quit on the third day.
551740	565820	But yeah, not a thing that I wanted to do, but I'm very glad it's done, and now it's
566660	571660	It's shower time.
571660	599860	I've yet to be at a conference that doesn't feel like it's just one day too long, and
599860	601740	this is the last day.
601740	604900	The big responsibility today is to record Cortex.
604900	608300	But before that happens I want to try to fit in just a little bit of exercise.
608300	614260	I'm going to get my bicycling in while I prepare for Cortex.
614260	624260	So I've got the bike, it looks like on the map there's a park along the Guadalupe River.
624260	629940	So I'm taking the bike there, and I'm going to go for a little bit of a ride.
629940	639980	I've gotten into the habit of not listening to music while I do aerobic exercise.
639980	647420	It makes exercising a good time to think, and like today I'm going to be combining the
647420	651140	exercise with preparing for Cortex.
651140	654540	So I've taken a look at the show notes, I've loaded them up in my head, I'm going to go
654540	660540	for a little bike ride and think about what I'm going to talk about on Cortex today.
660540	666500	Just as soon as I can figure out how to get down into the park.
666500	672020	Now it's time to attach the GoPro.
672020	677300	Perfect.
707300	715340	Thanks little buddy, that was way better than cycling indoors.
715340	718020	Time for shower and podcast.
718020	723780	Oh no, this is the worst.
723780	730180	I have to hide now for a little while, I'm going to be late to the podcast.
730180	740340	Can't do a podcast unless you have enough coffee to get through a podcast.
740340	742140	I'm bringing the coffee.
742140	743140	I finally did it.
743140	744140	What did you do?
744140	745540	We're in the same place.
745540	748100	We're working on something together in the same place.
748100	750900	We're at WWDC again.
750900	751900	We are.
751900	756620	But last year you made me record in a hotel room, and you were in your hotel room, and
756620	757620	we used Skype.
757620	758620	Yes, that's true.
758620	762740	This year you suggested, why don't we record in person?
762740	763820	I didn't suggest it.
763820	764880	I feel like you did.
764880	770380	You suggested it, and I agreed because I have a lot of audio equipment in my room right
770380	772860	now that I really didn't want to unbox.
772860	773860	That makes sense.
773860	783140	Okay, put the button on me.
783140	784860	Everyone is gone.
784860	787980	I'm still here because I need an extra day to prepare.
788340	792620	There's a place I need to get to by a certain time, and it's a bit... it's going to end
792620	793620	up being a bit involved.
793620	797060	So I'm guessing this vlog, which I originally thought was just going to be a short thing
797060	802820	at some conferences, is going to end up being a much longer thing, like two or three parts.
802820	803820	I don't know.
803820	809260	That's future Grey's editing problem.
809260	812140	Now Grey's problem is packing.
812140	817020	For suitcases and stuff, the rule is only bags go inside of suitcases, not things.
817060	819140	Bags in suitcases.
819140	821740	Things can go in the bags, not in the suitcase.
821740	826740	Alright, I got the packing done way faster than expected because, of course, I realized
826740	828220	I don't need to pack it well.
828220	832740	I just need to get it all boxed up so I c**t right now.
836740	838740	Faster than the SEC.
840740	842740	To this point, anyway, with 19 home runs.
847020	855020	I'm sure it looked the way on the camera, but holy hell.
872020	874820	Let me hear the day before VidCon starts.
874820	877220	The pre-conference feeling is nice.
877220	882940	I always like being in places before the action happens, as it's being set up.
882940	885780	It's the feeling of potential.
885780	893180	All that potential of what could be before what actually happens empties you to the core.
893180	901120	And this conference, this VidCon, is particularly draining because the longer you spend time
901120	905720	near L.A., the more desaturated your life becomes.
905720	911120	L.A. is a dementor in city form, but right now I'm still fresh.
911120	912500	I like exploring.
912500	916460	I like the feeling of solitude in places that should be full.
916460	920120	It's peaceful, and it won't stay that way for long.
927120	929120	It has begun.
931120	933120	It has begun.
946120	948120	Stay close, coffee.
948120	950120	I need you now more than ever.
950120	967120	I'm so exhausted, and these cookies are everywhere, depleting my willpower in all of the lounges.
967120	969120	Everywhere, there aren't crowds.
969120	971120	There are cookies.
971120	974120	A cookie would feel so good right now.
974120	976120	But I must resist.
976120	979120	In case you're wondering, I stayed off of carbs during part two.
979120	987120	It's been about three weeks so far without carbs, and this is the final hard stretch as VidCon is such an assault on the mind.
987120	991120	And to cope with it, I've chosen poorly in years past.
991120	992120	What?
992120	995120	You overestimate the power of this. I don't understand why you think this is interesting.
995120	998120	Brady's gonna want to see a snap from you.
998120	1000120	Okay.
1001120	1003120	I'm making better choices this time.
1003120	1004120	Thank you very much.
1004120	1010120	But America really doesn't help when there's a pizza button on the phone and a sign for the pizza button.
1010120	1012120	I think they really want me to eat pizza.
1012120	1014120	But I'm going to stay strong.
1014120	1017120	Only two weeks left to escape from America, not fatter.
1035120	1039120	I feel like this place is the opposite of me.
1050120	1054120	So much screaming and filming.
1054120	1068120	Okay, so the question was, you guys with your cameras, everybody behind you can't see me.
1076120	1078120	Amazing.
1084120	1088120	There's people everywhere. Well, almost everywhere.
1108120	1110120	Good luck with that.
1114120	1116120	Good luck with that.
1132120	1139120	Future Grey taking over here, as at this point past Grey was really pushed beyond his social limits.
1139120	1144120	Suddenly there is no more talking to the camera. There's just simply no more talking.
1144120	1152120	This first summer of Grey was exhausting beyond my ability to explain, but it was also a great and hugely successful trip.
1152120	1156120	I wanted to try to have more meetings with people, and boy did I ever.
1156120	1168120	But it was time to go. I needed a break, and there was a place that I wanted to go where I could just be quiet and not have to see people and not have to do anything and just recharge for a while.
1169120	1180120	So that's where I went, and there is perhaps nothing more uplifting to the human soul than taking a flight out of LA to a place where you actually want to be.
1180120	1191120	So I recharged for a while, I went back to North Carolina to see my family again, and then I returned home to London, and thus ended the summer of Grey.
1191120	1198120	Oh right, I also came back not fatter.
