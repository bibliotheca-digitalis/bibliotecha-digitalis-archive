1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Well, that doesn't look good.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,600
Hello Lucy Liu.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm in North Carolina.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,640
It's the start of what is going to be five long weeks of business travel and business

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
meetings.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm trying to get better at business meetings.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,520
Also while I'm here, I'm setting for myself the goal of escaping from America not fatter

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,360
than I arrived because I've fallen off the health bandwagon a bit lately and I really

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,040
don't want to make things worse but that might be impossible given that in America the streets

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
are paved with donuts.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,520
But I'm going to try and right now that's future Grey's problem.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,760
Current Grey is on the porch with a dog visiting family so no more vlogging and let's skip

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,800
to Denver, Colorado.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,080
Just stopping off to get some coffee and use the restroom and tornado shelter and eat bad

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,040
food strangely.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,080
More details later.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,780
On to San Jose, California just south of San Francisco.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,020
Work travel is never fun but it's extra not fun when you arrive at the hotel to find out

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,640
that they don't have your room that you booked months ago.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,800
The reservation they have but not the room.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,840
Suspiciously it seems many people who booked the hotel rooms at a super cheap price before

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,560
the hotels realized that WWDC had changed locations to a new city.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
Because people don't have rooms the rooms have been re-rented at a higher price.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
So what happens to the people who do have a reservation?

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,000
Why conveniently they put you in a hotel on the other side of the city.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,680
A hotel with the douchiest privacy please sign I've ever seen.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,720
But I didn't fly across an ocean and a continent to be 45 minutes away from all of the reasons

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
that I'm here.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,420
So I was rather firm with the hotel and suddenly like magic they did have a free upgrade to

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,100
a better room but not for tonight so I still have to be at this place and I can't set up

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,180
any of my work and it won't be until I drive back tomorrow morning that I can actually

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,900
get started on the reasons that I'm here.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,740
In fairness the apology suite is quite nice and it comes with an apology letter and apology

34
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,020
chocolate that I can't eat because I must escape from America not fatter.

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:44,660
Cool pro tip you can have stuff delivered to the hotel so you don't have to pack it.

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,220
This is only half the boxes I have to unpack and I didn't unpack all the boxes in the boxes

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,980
but as I switched hotels this morning I'm running out of time before WWDC begins so

38
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,020
I need to get out of here.

39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,620
WWDC is a conference where Apple brings developers from the wide world to announce new features

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,340
of their software so programmers can implement them.

41
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,820
A ticket inside is a front row to the future.

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,980
I don't have a ticket.

43
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:19,780
I've got a hotel room and a wishlist which is far more funny for crowd reactions anyway.

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:27,380
And fooling around on Twitter during the boring parts.

45
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:36,940
Keynote's over now it's time to set up my mobile office.

46
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:44,300
Watch some technical talks.

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:52,700
Attend tech podcasts to discuss the tech and sometimes with singalongs.

48
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Which brings us to Why Am I Here?

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,140
At the end of WWDC it's to record a podcast about WWDC.

50
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,300
The podcast is called Cortex on a network called Relay and that's another reason that

51
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm here.

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,140
There's a big Relay Listener Meetup that I'm going to.

53
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,700
Pascrae didn't film anything at the event but to be fair to him he was running on low

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,740
power mode at that point.

55
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,980
I really find jet lag so frustrating.

56
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,380
On this trip I'm trying to acclimatize to West Coast time.

57
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,860
I was out last night at the Relay podcast meetup.

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,580
I was just talking to people and then pow I was hit with that.

59
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,420
I'm going to fall asleep immediately feeling.

60
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:41,220
So I come back to the hotel to get a good night's sleep but no of course here I am.

61
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
It's four in the morning.

62
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,300
I know I'm just going to be awake for a while like a zombie.

63
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,580
Thanks jet lag.

64
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:03,680
I was on my way to go find some coffee but I think this is what I need to do today.

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,860
This is goal number one but later coffee first.

66
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,020
Alright time to do this.

67
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,680
I tried to do some fancy camera work but then this happened so forget that.

68
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,660
No more recording in gyms while I'm doing weight stuff.

69
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,900
It feels super weird to vlog then anyway.

70
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,420
America is a place where you can really double down on your eating mistakes.

71
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:34,200
I really want to avoid that so my plan while I'm here is just to cut out as many carbohydrates

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
as I can from my diet.

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,140
This means no pancakes, no bread, no pastas, no pizza, no crackers.

74
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,900
Normally the kind of stuff that I would eat an enormous amount of when I'm under a lot

75
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,060
of pressure and doing a lot of work.

76
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,000
And since I'm also traveling at the same time it's kind of doubly hard but it is possible

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,140
to do if you can eat the eggs but not the muffin.

78
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,100
So I'm going to the supermarket to load up on all the kinds of things that I'm going

79
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,560
to be eating lots of.

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,380
Meat and cheese and eggs and emergency almonds and emergency jerky.

81
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,400
It's not fun and it's not what I want to do but this is the most simple and effective

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,580
thing that I have found in the past for dropping or maintaining weight and if there's one thing

83
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,380
I could use this summer it's a bit of simple.

84
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Thank you checkout robots.

85
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,540
You don't ask any questions and I really appreciate you for that.

86
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,480
Conferencing is mentally taxing but I find it helps to map the outlines of the day and

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,280
try to specify what objectives for time well spent are.

88
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,080
What I need to do, who I need to see, what sessions I should go to.

89
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,160
And as a personal development point I'm trying to get better at meeting with interesting

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,460
people while I'm business traveling and these conferences can be a crazy overlapping puzzle

91
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
of everyone's schedules.

92
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,940
Right now I'm on my way to a meeting with someone.

93
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,640
The only time we can find for both of us that overlapped is while he's packing his bags

94
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
to go.

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,640
So that's where I'm headed.

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,580
Alright, packing meeting over.

97
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,220
On to more stuff.

98
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,940
The no carbohydrates health plan is going pretty well so far but now during business

99
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,940
meetings I'm the weirdo who's not eating the burger bun and has to explain why.

100
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,940
Do I recognize the model of truck?

101
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
I do not.

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,660
I've been lucky enough to be invited out to see some interesting headquarters in the past

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,180
including Dropbox and Facebook.

104
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,820
This time it's Google with their, why is there a dinosaur over there?

105
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,860
And this is a sad dystopian graveyard of Android's past.

106
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,560
And office interior they really rather you didn't film.

107
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,220
Then on to the computer history museum with so many buttons.

108
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,960
I want to press them all.

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,260
And remembered fun things long forgotten.

110
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:13,180
And traumatic things long forgotten.

111
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,500
And got totally distracted by seeing my first Tesla charger in real life.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Oh god.

113
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,620
Tesla's, Tesla's as far as the eye can see.

114
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,860
Oh, this is the X.

115
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:37,660
I'm pretty tired and I really don't want to, it's been a long day but I'm going to the

116
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
gym.

117
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,420
And everywhere you go in America, screens, screens, screens.

118
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,740
But you know what, thank you.

119
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
But no thank you.

120
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,780
Alright, I'm doing this.

121
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,660
Pretty pleased about that.

122
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,060
I had just, I really didn't want to do it, but I'd only just barely started a streak

123
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,740
of exercising, so I wasn't going to quit on the third day.

124
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:25,820
But yeah, not a thing that I wanted to do, but I'm very glad it's done, and now it's

125
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,660
It's shower time.

126
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:59,860
I've yet to be at a conference that doesn't feel like it's just one day too long, and

127
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,740
this is the last day.

128
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,900
The big responsibility today is to record Cortex.

129
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,300
But before that happens I want to try to fit in just a little bit of exercise.

130
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,260
I'm going to get my bicycling in while I prepare for Cortex.

131
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:24,260
So I've got the bike, it looks like on the map there's a park along the Guadalupe River.

132
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,940
So I'm taking the bike there, and I'm going to go for a little bit of a ride.

133
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:39,980
I've gotten into the habit of not listening to music while I do aerobic exercise.

134
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:47,420
It makes exercising a good time to think, and like today I'm going to be combining the

135
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,140
exercise with preparing for Cortex.

136
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,540
So I've taken a look at the show notes, I've loaded them up in my head, I'm going to go

137
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,540
for a little bike ride and think about what I'm going to talk about on Cortex today.

138
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,500
Just as soon as I can figure out how to get down into the park.

139
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,020
Now it's time to attach the GoPro.

140
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,300
Perfect.

141
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,340
Thanks little buddy, that was way better than cycling indoors.

142
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,020
Time for shower and podcast.

143
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,780
Oh no, this is the worst.

144
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:10,180
I have to hide now for a little while, I'm going to be late to the podcast.

145
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:20,340
Can't do a podcast unless you have enough coffee to get through a podcast.

146
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm bringing the coffee.

147
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
I finally did it.

148
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
What did you do?

149
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,540
We're in the same place.

150
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,100
We're working on something together in the same place.

151
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,900
We're at WWDC again.

152
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
We are.

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,620
But last year you made me record in a hotel room, and you were in your hotel room, and

154
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
we used Skype.

155
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
Yes, that's true.

156
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,740
This year you suggested, why don't we record in person?

157
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,820
I didn't suggest it.

158
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,880
I feel like you did.

159
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,380
You suggested it, and I agreed because I have a lot of audio equipment in my room right

160
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,860
now that I really didn't want to unbox.

161
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
That makes sense.

162
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:03,140
Okay, put the button on me.

163
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,860
Everyone is gone.

164
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,980
I'm still here because I need an extra day to prepare.

165
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,620
There's a place I need to get to by a certain time, and it's a bit... it's going to end

166
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,620
up being a bit involved.

167
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,060
So I'm guessing this vlog, which I originally thought was just going to be a short thing

168
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,820
at some conferences, is going to end up being a much longer thing, like two or three parts.

169
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I don't know.

170
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,260
That's future Grey's editing problem.

171
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,140
Now Grey's problem is packing.

172
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,020
For suitcases and stuff, the rule is only bags go inside of suitcases, not things.

173
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,140
Bags in suitcases.

174
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,740
Things can go in the bags, not in the suitcase.

175
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Alright, I got the packing done way faster than expected because, of course, I realized

176
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,220
I don't need to pack it well.

177
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,740
I just need to get it all boxed up so I c**t right now.

178
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Faster than the SEC.

179
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
To this point, anyway, with 19 home runs.

180
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm sure it looked the way on the camera, but holy hell.

181
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,820
Let me hear the day before VidCon starts.

182
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,220
The pre-conference feeling is nice.

183
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,940
I always like being in places before the action happens, as it's being set up.

184
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,780
It's the feeling of potential.

185
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:53,180
All that potential of what could be before what actually happens empties you to the core.

186
00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:01,120
And this conference, this VidCon, is particularly draining because the longer you spend time

187
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,720
near L.A., the more desaturated your life becomes.

188
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,120
L.A. is a dementor in city form, but right now I'm still fresh.

189
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,500
I like exploring.

190
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,460
I like the feeling of solitude in places that should be full.

191
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,120
It's peaceful, and it won't stay that way for long.

192
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
It has begun.

193
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
It has begun.

194
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Stay close, coffee.

195
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
I need you now more than ever.

196
00:15:50,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm so exhausted, and these cookies are everywhere, depleting my willpower in all of the lounges.

197
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Everywhere, there aren't crowds.

198
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
There are cookies.

199
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,120
A cookie would feel so good right now.

200
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
But I must resist.

201
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,120
In case you're wondering, I stayed off of carbs during part two.

202
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:27,120
It's been about three weeks so far without carbs, and this is the final hard stretch as VidCon is such an assault on the mind.

203
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
And to cope with it, I've chosen poorly in years past.

204
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
What?

205
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,120
You overestimate the power of this. I don't understand why you think this is interesting.

206
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Brady's gonna want to see a snap from you.

207
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Okay.

208
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm making better choices this time.

209
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Thank you very much.

210
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,120
But America really doesn't help when there's a pizza button on the phone and a sign for the pizza button.

211
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I think they really want me to eat pizza.

212
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
But I'm going to stay strong.

213
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Only two weeks left to escape from America, not fatter.

214
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I feel like this place is the opposite of me.

215
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,120
So much screaming and filming.

216
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Okay, so the question was, you guys with your cameras, everybody behind you can't see me.

217
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Amazing.

218
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,120
There's people everywhere. Well, almost everywhere.

219
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Good luck with that.

220
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Good luck with that.

221
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:59,120
Future Grey taking over here, as at this point past Grey was really pushed beyond his social limits.

222
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Suddenly there is no more talking to the camera. There's just simply no more talking.

223
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:12,120
This first summer of Grey was exhausting beyond my ability to explain, but it was also a great and hugely successful trip.

224
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,120
I wanted to try to have more meetings with people, and boy did I ever.

225
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:28,120
But it was time to go. I needed a break, and there was a place that I wanted to go where I could just be quiet and not have to see people and not have to do anything and just recharge for a while.

226
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:40,120
So that's where I went, and there is perhaps nothing more uplifting to the human soul than taking a flight out of LA to a place where you actually want to be.

227
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:51,120
So I recharged for a while, I went back to North Carolina to see my family again, and then I returned home to London, and thus ended the summer of Grey.

228
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Oh right, I also came back not fatter.
