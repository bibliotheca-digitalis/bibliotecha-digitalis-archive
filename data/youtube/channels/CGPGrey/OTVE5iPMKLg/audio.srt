1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Every day the world consumes 300 tons of caffeine, enough for one cup of coffee for every man,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
woman and child.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,520
The world's largest buyer of coffee, the US, has to import nearly all of this, as the

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,920
coffee trees from which caffeine is harvested will only grow at commercial levels between

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn in an area called the Coffee Belt.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,280
Only a single state, Hawaii, is within this belt.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,560
However, the United States is only the largest buyer because it's so populous.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,760
The most enthusiastic coffee drinkers per capita are, in increasing order, the Netherlands,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
Denmark, Iceland, Norway and, the world champions, Finland, where they drink three times as much

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,400
coffee a day as the average American.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,760
All of these countries are outside the coffee belt and must import 100% of their caffeine

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
supply.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,200
To get this caffeine, first bees must pollinate the flowers of a coffee tree, and these flowers

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,080
develop into bright red berries.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,440
Unlike more cooperative domestic plants, the coffee tree does not ripen all its berries

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,400
at the same time, so they need to be hand picked and sorted.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,840
Once picked, the coffee bean is removed from inside the berry.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,380
This young seedling of the tree is then dried, heated, ground and submersed in boiling water

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,620
to get out the precious, precious caffeine.

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,420
It takes about 40 coffee beans to make one shot of espresso.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,020
But why is caffeine in the coffee beans in the first place?

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,420
It's not like the coffee trees want to have humans cutting bits off of them and committing

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,940
a holocaust of their offspring.

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,060
Well, the trees of course don't want or feel anything.

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,780
They originally evolved caffeine for their own benefit.

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,040
Caffeine is an insecticide that effectively paralyzes or kills bugs chomping on the tree.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,620
Whether or not these insects go out experiencing the greatest caffeine high ever is not known.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,740
While caffeine is technically lethal, it's adapted for 1 gram bugs, not monkeys 100,000

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
times more massive.

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,920
So you'd really have to try to win this Darwin award.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,220
But if you mustâ€¦

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,060
To calculate the dose of caffeine you'll need to ingest to have a 50% chance of death,

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,820
take your mass in kilograms and multiply it by 150 milligrams.

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,340
Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram of mass you have, you need to drink one latte

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,860
to get a visit from the grim reaper.

36
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,460
That's a lot of coffee, so it's not surprising that there are no recorded deaths in healthy

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,760
adults from this method, and it's doubtful that it's even possible.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,200
Because while you're busy getting coffee in, your body is busy getting it out by one

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,580
way or another.

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,960
The rare recorded deaths from caffeine are from diet pills, pep pills and crazy people

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
who eat the drug in its pure form.

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Poisoned though caffeine is, you do still develop an addiction to the stuff, and it's

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,040
a real physiological addiction, not a wimpy psychological addiction like people claim

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,140
for video games and the internet.

45
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,440
But caffeine isn't heroin, rapid withdrawal won't kill you, it might make you cranky

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,920
and give you a wicked headache, but since caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,720
and it gets rid of headaches, there's really no reason to ever stop using the stuff.

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
And who would want to give it up anyway?

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,320
I mean, aside from converts to mormonism and rostafarianism.

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,460
Caffeine is the world's most used psychoactive drug, and with good reason, it's pure awesome.

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,600
It increases concentration, decreases fatigue and gives you better memory.

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,680
And this isn't just a placebo, these are real effects, replicable in a laboratory.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,560
And contrary to popular belief, drinking coffee isn't a Faustian bargain where the devil

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,300
gives you the ability to work faster, but in exchange makes your life shorter.

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,740
For normal, healthy humans, there are no medical concerns.

56
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,680
Coffee and the caffeine within it may even have medical benefits, such as protection

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,360
from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson's.

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,320
Caffeine can even get rid of migraines, but the amount required and the method of ingestion

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
is uncomfortable.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Moving right along.

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,920
You know what else you can thank caffeine for?

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,600
A little thing called the Enlightenment.

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,960
In the 1600s, people drank more beer and gin than water.

64
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,680
But with the introduction of coffee and tea, people switched from a depressant to a stimulant.

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,160
It's not surprising, then, that this time was an intellectual boon compared to earlier

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
centuries.

67
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,420
Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their coffee for the same reason that modern workers

68
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
and students do.

69
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,060
It's invaluable for staying awake and concentrating when you need to finish a TPS report or get

70
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,960
through that boring physics class.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,300
Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so go grab a cup guilt-free and get working smarter

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,020
and faster.
