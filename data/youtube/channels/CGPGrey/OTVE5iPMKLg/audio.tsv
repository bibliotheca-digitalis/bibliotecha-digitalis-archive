0	5920	Every day the world consumes 300 tons of caffeine, enough for one cup of coffee for every man,
5920	6920	woman and child.
6920	10520	The world's largest buyer of coffee, the US, has to import nearly all of this, as the
10520	13920	coffee trees from which caffeine is harvested will only grow at commercial levels between
13920	17920	the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn in an area called the Coffee Belt.
17920	20280	Only a single state, Hawaii, is within this belt.
20280	23560	However, the United States is only the largest buyer because it's so populous.
23560	27760	The most enthusiastic coffee drinkers per capita are, in increasing order, the Netherlands,
27760	32160	Denmark, Iceland, Norway and, the world champions, Finland, where they drink three times as much
32160	34400	coffee a day as the average American.
34400	37760	All of these countries are outside the coffee belt and must import 100% of their caffeine
37760	38760	supply.
38760	42200	To get this caffeine, first bees must pollinate the flowers of a coffee tree, and these flowers
42200	44080	develop into bright red berries.
44080	47440	Unlike more cooperative domestic plants, the coffee tree does not ripen all its berries
47440	50400	at the same time, so they need to be hand picked and sorted.
50400	52840	Once picked, the coffee bean is removed from inside the berry.
52840	56380	This young seedling of the tree is then dried, heated, ground and submersed in boiling water
56380	58620	to get out the precious, precious caffeine.
58620	61420	It takes about 40 coffee beans to make one shot of espresso.
61420	64020	But why is caffeine in the coffee beans in the first place?
64020	67420	It's not like the coffee trees want to have humans cutting bits off of them and committing
67420	68940	a holocaust of their offspring.
68940	72060	Well, the trees of course don't want or feel anything.
72060	74780	They originally evolved caffeine for their own benefit.
74780	79040	Caffeine is an insecticide that effectively paralyzes or kills bugs chomping on the tree.
79040	83620	Whether or not these insects go out experiencing the greatest caffeine high ever is not known.
83620	87740	While caffeine is technically lethal, it's adapted for 1 gram bugs, not monkeys 100,000
87740	88740	times more massive.
88740	90920	So you'd really have to try to win this Darwin award.
90920	92220	But if you mustâ€¦
92220	96060	To calculate the dose of caffeine you'll need to ingest to have a 50% chance of death,
96060	99820	take your mass in kilograms and multiply it by 150 milligrams.
99820	103340	Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram of mass you have, you need to drink one latte
103340	104860	to get a visit from the grim reaper.
104860	108460	That's a lot of coffee, so it's not surprising that there are no recorded deaths in healthy
108460	111760	adults from this method, and it's doubtful that it's even possible.
111760	115200	Because while you're busy getting coffee in, your body is busy getting it out by one
115200	116580	way or another.
116580	119960	The rare recorded deaths from caffeine are from diet pills, pep pills and crazy people
119960	122520	who eat the drug in its pure form.
122520	125320	Poisoned though caffeine is, you do still develop an addiction to the stuff, and it's
125320	129040	a real physiological addiction, not a wimpy psychological addiction like people claim
129040	131140	for video games and the internet.
131140	134440	But caffeine isn't heroin, rapid withdrawal won't kill you, it might make you cranky
134440	137920	and give you a wicked headache, but since caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy
137920	141720	and it gets rid of headaches, there's really no reason to ever stop using the stuff.
141720	142840	And who would want to give it up anyway?
142840	146320	I mean, aside from converts to mormonism and rostafarianism.
146320	150460	Caffeine is the world's most used psychoactive drug, and with good reason, it's pure awesome.
150460	153600	It increases concentration, decreases fatigue and gives you better memory.
153600	157680	And this isn't just a placebo, these are real effects, replicable in a laboratory.
157680	161560	And contrary to popular belief, drinking coffee isn't a Faustian bargain where the devil
161560	165300	gives you the ability to work faster, but in exchange makes your life shorter.
165300	167740	For normal, healthy humans, there are no medical concerns.
167740	170680	Coffee and the caffeine within it may even have medical benefits, such as protection
170680	174360	from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson's.
174360	177320	Caffeine can even get rid of migraines, but the amount required and the method of ingestion
177320	178320	is uncomfortable.
178320	179320	Moving right along.
179320	181920	You know what else you can thank caffeine for?
181920	183600	A little thing called the Enlightenment.
183600	186960	In the 1600s, people drank more beer and gin than water.
186960	190680	But with the introduction of coffee and tea, people switched from a depressant to a stimulant.
190680	194160	It's not surprising, then, that this time was an intellectual boon compared to earlier
194160	195160	centuries.
195160	198420	Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their coffee for the same reason that modern workers
198420	199420	and students do.
199460	203060	It's invaluable for staying awake and concentrating when you need to finish a TPS report or get
203060	204960	through that boring physics class.
204960	208300	Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so go grab a cup guilt-free and get working smarter
208300	209020	and faster.
