00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
Every day the world consumes 300 tons of caffeine, enough for one cup of coffee for every man,

00:05.920 --> 00:06.920
woman and child.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.520
The world's largest buyer of coffee, the US, has to import nearly all of this, as the

00:10.520 --> 00:13.920
coffee trees from which caffeine is harvested will only grow at commercial levels between

00:13.920 --> 00:17.920
the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn in an area called the Coffee Belt.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.280
Only a single state, Hawaii, is within this belt.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.560
However, the United States is only the largest buyer because it's so populous.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.760
The most enthusiastic coffee drinkers per capita are, in increasing order, the Netherlands,

00:27.760 --> 00:32.160
Denmark, Iceland, Norway and, the world champions, Finland, where they drink three times as much

00:32.160 --> 00:34.400
coffee a day as the average American.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.760
All of these countries are outside the coffee belt and must import 100% of their caffeine

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
supply.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.200
To get this caffeine, first bees must pollinate the flowers of a coffee tree, and these flowers

00:42.200 --> 00:44.080
develop into bright red berries.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.440
Unlike more cooperative domestic plants, the coffee tree does not ripen all its berries

00:47.440 --> 00:50.400
at the same time, so they need to be hand picked and sorted.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.840
Once picked, the coffee bean is removed from inside the berry.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.380
This young seedling of the tree is then dried, heated, ground and submersed in boiling water

00:56.380 --> 00:58.620
to get out the precious, precious caffeine.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.420
It takes about 40 coffee beans to make one shot of espresso.

01:01.420 --> 01:04.020
But why is caffeine in the coffee beans in the first place?

01:04.020 --> 01:07.420
It's not like the coffee trees want to have humans cutting bits off of them and committing

01:07.420 --> 01:08.940
a holocaust of their offspring.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.060
Well, the trees of course don't want or feel anything.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.780
They originally evolved caffeine for their own benefit.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.040
Caffeine is an insecticide that effectively paralyzes or kills bugs chomping on the tree.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.620
Whether or not these insects go out experiencing the greatest caffeine high ever is not known.

01:23.620 --> 01:27.740
While caffeine is technically lethal, it's adapted for 1 gram bugs, not monkeys 100,000

01:27.740 --> 01:28.740
times more massive.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.920
So you'd really have to try to win this Darwin award.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.220
But if you mustâ€¦

01:32.220 --> 01:36.060
To calculate the dose of caffeine you'll need to ingest to have a 50% chance of death,

01:36.060 --> 01:39.820
take your mass in kilograms and multiply it by 150 milligrams.

01:39.820 --> 01:43.340
Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram of mass you have, you need to drink one latte

01:43.340 --> 01:44.860
to get a visit from the grim reaper.

01:44.860 --> 01:48.460
That's a lot of coffee, so it's not surprising that there are no recorded deaths in healthy

01:48.460 --> 01:51.760
adults from this method, and it's doubtful that it's even possible.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.200
Because while you're busy getting coffee in, your body is busy getting it out by one

01:55.200 --> 01:56.580
way or another.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.960
The rare recorded deaths from caffeine are from diet pills, pep pills and crazy people

01:59.960 --> 02:02.520
who eat the drug in its pure form.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.320
Poisoned though caffeine is, you do still develop an addiction to the stuff, and it's

02:05.320 --> 02:09.040
a real physiological addiction, not a wimpy psychological addiction like people claim

02:09.040 --> 02:11.140
for video games and the internet.

02:11.140 --> 02:14.440
But caffeine isn't heroin, rapid withdrawal won't kill you, it might make you cranky

02:14.440 --> 02:17.920
and give you a wicked headache, but since caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy

02:17.920 --> 02:21.720
and it gets rid of headaches, there's really no reason to ever stop using the stuff.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.840
And who would want to give it up anyway?

02:22.840 --> 02:26.320
I mean, aside from converts to mormonism and rostafarianism.

02:26.320 --> 02:30.460
Caffeine is the world's most used psychoactive drug, and with good reason, it's pure awesome.

02:30.460 --> 02:33.600
It increases concentration, decreases fatigue and gives you better memory.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.680
And this isn't just a placebo, these are real effects, replicable in a laboratory.

02:37.680 --> 02:41.560
And contrary to popular belief, drinking coffee isn't a Faustian bargain where the devil

02:41.560 --> 02:45.300
gives you the ability to work faster, but in exchange makes your life shorter.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.740
For normal, healthy humans, there are no medical concerns.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.680
Coffee and the caffeine within it may even have medical benefits, such as protection

02:50.680 --> 02:54.360
from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson's.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.320
Caffeine can even get rid of migraines, but the amount required and the method of ingestion

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
is uncomfortable.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
Moving right along.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.920
You know what else you can thank caffeine for?

03:01.920 --> 03:03.600
A little thing called the Enlightenment.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.960
In the 1600s, people drank more beer and gin than water.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.680
But with the introduction of coffee and tea, people switched from a depressant to a stimulant.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.160
It's not surprising, then, that this time was an intellectual boon compared to earlier

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
centuries.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.420
Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their coffee for the same reason that modern workers

03:18.420 --> 03:19.420
and students do.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.060
It's invaluable for staying awake and concentrating when you need to finish a TPS report or get

03:23.060 --> 03:24.960
through that boring physics class.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.300
Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so go grab a cup guilt-free and get working smarter

03:28.300 --> 03:29.020
and faster.
