00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Before this video loaded, you probably watched an ad, and or one will appear right about now.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.640
How did this exact ad get on this video?

00:08.640 --> 00:12.400
And what you really want to know, how much money do these things make?

00:12.400 --> 00:14.480
Okay, there are three players in this game.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.520
Creators who create videos, advertisers who make the ads,

00:17.520 --> 00:20.720
and YouTube who plays Matchmaker Matchmaker Making the Match.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.600
Now, unlike old dying media where a dude in a room could place ads on predictable known content

00:25.600 --> 00:28.480
at a leisurely schedule, YouTube doesn't work like that.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.240
And it can't work like that, because on YouTube there is no schedule.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.960
At any moment, a wild viral video can appear.

00:34.960 --> 00:42.320
On a normal day, 65 years worth of videos are uploaded to YouTube and people watch a billion hours of video.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.880
It's an endless waterfall of random content that just keeps growing.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.760
Hiring enough humans to categorize all those videos and match ads to them would be impossible.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.600
This is a job for bots.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.720
The moment each new video is uploaded, YouTube's bots get to work,

00:56.720 --> 00:59.920
looking at the title, the keywords, the captions, the comments, the controversy,

00:59.920 --> 01:04.400
all to make their best guess as to what category it belongs in.

01:04.400 --> 01:10.240
Meanwhile, advertisers tell their own bots what category of videos they want their ads to run against

01:10.240 --> 01:12.000
and what kind to avoid.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.240
And here is where YouTube earns their money.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.120
Between when you click on a video and when it plays, a YouTube bot holds an auction,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.680
announcing the categories it's guessed the video is in,

01:21.680 --> 01:26.240
opening the floor to all interested advertiser bots to place their bids.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.720
The winning advertiser bot is the one with the ad that will most likely make YouTube and the creator

01:30.720 --> 01:32.480
the most money at that instant.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.720
But that's not necessarily the highest bidder.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.040
Different ads pay in different ways.

01:37.040 --> 01:43.120
For example, skippable video ads, the advertiser doesn't pay if the viewer skips as soon as they can.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.880
The advertiser only pays if their ad is clicked or watched.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.400
A super high bid means nothing if the ad is super boring.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.840
No clicks equals no dollars for YouTube or the creator.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.240
So there's a bias against boring.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.080
The auctioneer bot will prefer a lower bid for an ad with a higher click rate

02:00.080 --> 02:02.960
than a higher bid for an ad with a lower click rate.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.200
But boring is in the eye of the beholder.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.720
So in addition to YouTube's bots trying to guess what the video is about,

02:08.720 --> 02:12.000
there are bots that try to guess what the viewer is about,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.160
looking at their watch history and device and activity to try and guess their age,

02:16.160 --> 02:18.400
chromosomes, income, location, and interests.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.560
This information, too, is part of the auction,

02:20.560 --> 02:24.320
and the advertisers can instruct their bots to only bid to specific demographics

02:24.320 --> 02:28.640
and specific locations and specific categories and only up to specific amounts.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.400
So whatever ad you saw before this video didn't plan to be there.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.200
It was the result of bot guesses about the video

02:35.200 --> 02:40.160
and bot guesses about you and bot bids for your attention at that exact millisecond.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.840
Watch videos from this channel on the device of someone demographically different

02:43.840 --> 02:46.000
and you'll see different kinds of ads.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.040
You should try it with this video on at least two or three or four...

02:49.040 --> 02:51.120
Look, watch this video on a lot of different devices.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.080
Anyway, if you want to know how much advertisers pay YouTube and creators,

02:54.080 --> 02:55.760
there isn't one answer.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.440
It's all an insta-auction and varies wildly by video category,

02:59.440 --> 03:01.680
the viewers, the time of year, advertising budget,

03:01.680 --> 03:05.040
how many auctions are happening at that exact moment, and how full they are.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.240
It's millions of matches a minute of supply and demand.

03:08.240 --> 03:13.920
Channels with prized demographics may earn five times as much per view as other channels.

03:13.920 --> 03:19.440
But you and I both know there's still some kind of average number,

03:19.440 --> 03:23.120
something to use as a ballpark, and that's what you want to know.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.280
On average, this number.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.640
How many Benjamins?

03:26.640 --> 03:31.680
Okay, a reasonable estimate is one view is worth one quarter of one penny

03:31.680 --> 03:34.240
split between YouTube and the creator,

03:34.240 --> 03:38.320
which is the first time a penny has proved too great a measure of value.

03:38.320 --> 03:44.720
So a better way to think about it is 1,000 views generates about $2.50 of advertising dollars.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.720
YouTube then splits that money between the creator and themselves $55.45,

03:48.720 --> 03:52.160
about $1.40 for the creator and $1.10 for YouTube.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.840
Or, if you want to think big about it,

03:53.840 --> 03:59.680
every million views is $1,400 for the creator and $1,100 for YouTube.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.280
Again, on average,

04:01.280 --> 04:05.680
particular channels might be splitting 50 cents per thousand or $4.50 per thousand.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.440
It all depends on the auction.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.480
So that's how it works.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.080
A Niagara of content sorted and sold by bots to bots for humans to watch.
