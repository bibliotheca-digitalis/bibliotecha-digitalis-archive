0	6000	Before this video loaded, you probably watched an ad, and or one will appear right about now.
6000	8640	How did this exact ad get on this video?
8640	12400	And what you really want to know, how much money do these things make?
12400	14480	Okay, there are three players in this game.
14480	17520	Creators who create videos, advertisers who make the ads,
17520	20720	and YouTube who plays Matchmaker Matchmaker Making the Match.
20720	25600	Now, unlike old dying media where a dude in a room could place ads on predictable known content
25600	28480	at a leisurely schedule, YouTube doesn't work like that.
28480	32240	And it can't work like that, because on YouTube there is no schedule.
32240	34960	At any moment, a wild viral video can appear.
34960	42320	On a normal day, 65 years worth of videos are uploaded to YouTube and people watch a billion hours of video.
42320	46880	It's an endless waterfall of random content that just keeps growing.
46880	51760	Hiring enough humans to categorize all those videos and match ads to them would be impossible.
51760	53600	This is a job for bots.
53600	56720	The moment each new video is uploaded, YouTube's bots get to work,
56720	59920	looking at the title, the keywords, the captions, the comments, the controversy,
59920	64400	all to make their best guess as to what category it belongs in.
64400	70240	Meanwhile, advertisers tell their own bots what category of videos they want their ads to run against
70240	72000	and what kind to avoid.
72000	74240	And here is where YouTube earns their money.
74240	79120	Between when you click on a video and when it plays, a YouTube bot holds an auction,
79120	81680	announcing the categories it's guessed the video is in,
81680	86240	opening the floor to all interested advertiser bots to place their bids.
86240	90720	The winning advertiser bot is the one with the ad that will most likely make YouTube and the creator
90720	92480	the most money at that instant.
92480	94720	But that's not necessarily the highest bidder.
94720	97040	Different ads pay in different ways.
97040	103120	For example, skippable video ads, the advertiser doesn't pay if the viewer skips as soon as they can.
103120	106880	The advertiser only pays if their ad is clicked or watched.
106880	110400	A super high bid means nothing if the ad is super boring.
110400	113840	No clicks equals no dollars for YouTube or the creator.
113840	116240	So there's a bias against boring.
116240	120080	The auctioneer bot will prefer a lower bid for an ad with a higher click rate
120080	122960	than a higher bid for an ad with a lower click rate.
122960	125200	But boring is in the eye of the beholder.
125200	128720	So in addition to YouTube's bots trying to guess what the video is about,
128720	132000	there are bots that try to guess what the viewer is about,
132000	136160	looking at their watch history and device and activity to try and guess their age,
136160	138400	chromosomes, income, location, and interests.
138400	140560	This information, too, is part of the auction,
140560	144320	and the advertisers can instruct their bots to only bid to specific demographics
144320	148640	and specific locations and specific categories and only up to specific amounts.
148640	152400	So whatever ad you saw before this video didn't plan to be there.
152400	155200	It was the result of bot guesses about the video
155200	160160	and bot guesses about you and bot bids for your attention at that exact millisecond.
160160	163840	Watch videos from this channel on the device of someone demographically different
163840	166000	and you'll see different kinds of ads.
166000	169040	You should try it with this video on at least two or three or four...
169040	171120	Look, watch this video on a lot of different devices.
171120	174080	Anyway, if you want to know how much advertisers pay YouTube and creators,
174080	175760	there isn't one answer.
175760	179440	It's all an insta-auction and varies wildly by video category,
179440	181680	the viewers, the time of year, advertising budget,
181680	185040	how many auctions are happening at that exact moment, and how full they are.
185040	188240	It's millions of matches a minute of supply and demand.
188240	193920	Channels with prized demographics may earn five times as much per view as other channels.
193920	199440	But you and I both know there's still some kind of average number,
199440	203120	something to use as a ballpark, and that's what you want to know.
203120	205280	On average, this number.
205280	206640	How many Benjamins?
206640	211680	Okay, a reasonable estimate is one view is worth one quarter of one penny
211680	214240	split between YouTube and the creator,
214240	218320	which is the first time a penny has proved too great a measure of value.
218320	224720	So a better way to think about it is 1,000 views generates about $2.50 of advertising dollars.
224720	228720	YouTube then splits that money between the creator and themselves $55.45,
228720	232160	about $1.40 for the creator and $1.10 for YouTube.
232160	233840	Or, if you want to think big about it,
233840	239680	every million views is $1,400 for the creator and $1,100 for YouTube.
239680	241280	Again, on average,
241280	245680	particular channels might be splitting 50 cents per thousand or $4.50 per thousand.
245680	247440	It all depends on the auction.
247440	248480	So that's how it works.
248480	254080	A Niagara of content sorted and sold by bots to bots for humans to watch.
