1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Do you want to rule? Do you see the problems in your country and know how to fix them?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,500
If only you had the power to do so. Well, you've come to the right place.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,900
But before we begin this lesson in political power, ask yourself,

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:22,500
why don't rulers see as clearly as you, instead acting in such selfish, self-destructive, short-sighted ways?

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Are they stupid, these most powerful people in the world, or is it something else?

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
The throne looks omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Accept that, or turn back now, before we discuss the rules for rulers.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,500
No matter how bright the rays of any Sun King, no man rules alone.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,000
A king can't build roads alone, can't enforce laws alone, can't defend the nation or himself alone.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,500
The power of a king is not to act, but to get others to act on his behalf, using the treasure in his vaults.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,500
A king needs an army and someone to run it, treasure and someone to collect it, law and someone to enforce it.

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,000
The individuals needed to make the necessary things happen are the king's keys to power.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,500
All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands.

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,000
In a dictatorship where might makes right, the number of keys to power is small.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,500
Perhaps only a dozen generals, bureaucrats and regional leaders.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Sway them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but never forget, displease them and they will replace you.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now all countries lie on a spectrum, from those where the ruler needs few key supporters to those where the ruler needs many.

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
This foundation of power is why countries are different.

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Be it many keys or few, the rules are the same.

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,500
First, get the key supporters on your side.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
With them, you have the power to act. You have everything.

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Without them, you have nothing.

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, in order to keep those keys to power, you must second, control the treasure.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You must make sure your treasure is raised and distributed to you for all your hard work and to the keys needed to keep your position.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,500
This is your true work as a ruler, figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources so as not to topple the house of cards upon which your throne sits.

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Now you, aspiring benevolent dictator, may want to help your citizens, but your control of the treasure is what attracts rivals.

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
So you must keep those keys loyal.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,500
But there's only so much treasure in your vault, so much wealth your kingdom produces.

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,000
So beware, every bit of treasure spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,500
Thus, doing the right thing, spending the wealth of the nation on the citizens of the nation, hands a tool of power acquisition to your rivals.

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:12,000
The treasure poured into roads and universities and hospitals is treasure a rival can promise to key supporters if only they switch sides.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Benevolent dictators can spend their take on the citizens, but the keys must get their rewards.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,500
For even if you have gathered the most loyal, angelic supporters, they have the same problem as you, just one level down.

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,000
Being a key to power is a position of power.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They too must watch out for rivals from below or above.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Thus, the treasure they get must also be spent to maintain their position.

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:55,000
The loyal and dim may stay by your side no matter what, but smart key supporters will always watch the balance of power, ready to change allegiance if you look to be the loser in a shifting web of alliances.

39
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:06,500
In countries where the keys are few, the rewards are great, and when violence rules, the most ruthless are attracted, and angels that build good works will lose to devils that don't.

40
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,500
So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty in dictatorial organizations of all kinds is everything.

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
For the ruler, anyway.

42
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Thus, the dictatorship exposed, a king who needs his court to raise the treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure.

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,000
This is the self-sustaining core of power. All outside is secondary.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Now a king with many key supporters has real problems.

45
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Not just their expense, but also their competing needs and rivalries are difficult to balance.

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,500
The more complicated the social and financial web between them all, the more able a rival is to sway a critical mass.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
The more key supporters a ruler has on average, the shorter their reign.

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,000
Which brings us to the third rule for rulers. Minimize key supporters.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,500
If a key in your court becomes unnecessary, his skills no longer required, you must kick him out.

50
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:13,000
After a successful coup, the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power while working with the underlings of the previous dictator.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Which, from the outside, seems a terrible idea.

52
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,000
Why abandon your fellow revolutionaries?

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,500
Are the old dictator's supporters not a danger?

54
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,000
But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it.

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Having someone on the payroll who was vital in the past but useless now is the same as spending money on the citizens.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Treasure wasted on the irrelevant.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,500
And by definition, a dictator that pulls off a coup has promised greater treasure to those switching sides.

58
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,000
The size of the vault has not changed, so the treasure must be split among fewer.

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,500
A dictator that sways the right keys, takes control of the treasure, cuts unnecessary spending, kills unnecessary keys will have a long and successful career.

60
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Seeing the structure unveiled, you might be excited to get started and control a country to the benefit of you and your cronies.

61
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Or you might be exhausted, wishing to do good, but seeing the structural difficulties now turn to democracy for salvation.

62
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
So let us discuss rulers as representatives.

63
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,000
You, again, might have grand dreams of the utopia you wish to build, but no man rules alone.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And never more so than in democracy.

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Presidents and prime ministers must negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa.

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,500
And they all have their own key supporters to manage.

67
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,000
In a well-designed democracy, power is fractured among many and is taken not with force, but with words.

68
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Meaning you must get thousands or millions of citizens to, if not like you on election day, at least like you better than the alternative.

69
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,500
With so many voters and such fractured power, it's impossible to, as a dictator would, follow these rules and buy loyalty.

70
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Or is it? Of course not.

71
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires, but instead as divided into blocks.

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
The elderly, or homeowners, or business owners, or the poor.

73
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Blocks you can reward as a group.

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Democracies have wildly complicated tax codes and laws, not as accident, but as reward for the blocks that get and keep the ruling representatives in power.

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Farming subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with the food a nation needs, but entirely with how key the vote of the farming block is.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Countries where farmers' votes don't swing elections don't have farming subsidies.

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If a block doesn't vote, such as younger citizens, then no need to divert rewards their way.

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power.

79
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Which is good news for you.

80
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
One less block to sway and the treasure you give your key blocks has to come from somewhere.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you want long years in office, Rule 3 is your friend in a democracy just as much as a dictatorship.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can't eliminate those who don't vote for you, but there is still much you can do.

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Once in power, make it easier for your key blocks to vote and harder for others.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Establish voting systems that reduce the number of blocks you need to win, the more rivals you get.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Very handy indeed.

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Draw election borders to pre-determine the results for you or your cronies, and have party pre-elections with Byzantine rules to determine who blocks even can vote for.

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mix and match the above for even better power perpetuation.

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
When approval ratings couldn't be lower, yet re-election rates couldn't be higher, you'll know you've succeeded.

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, enough with thinking about the citizens.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even in a democracy, there still are very influential individual key supporters you need on your side.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because their money or influence or favors keeps you in power.

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:18,000
While you can't just promise to give them treasure directly, as a dictator would, you can create loopholes for their investments, pass laws that they've written, or print get-out-of-jail-free cards for their actions.

93
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not a wheelbarrow of gold to the door, but contracts for their business.

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You, as a ruler, do have roads to build or computers to maintain or buildings to reconstruct.

95
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No man rules alone, after all.

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Or you could take the moral path and ignore the big keys.

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But you'll fight against those who didn't. Good luck with that.

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Corruption is not some kind of petty crime, but rather a tool of power in democracies and dictatorships.

99
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But more on that another time.

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So accept the favors, sway the key blocks, and you will get into power.

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ruling with actions that look contradictory and stupid to those who don't understand the game.

102
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Privately helping a powerful industry you publicly denounced or passing laws that hurt a block that voted for you.

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But your job isn't to have a consistent, understandable ruling policy, but to balance the interests of your keys to power, big and small.

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That is how you stay in office.

105
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Now with all this headache of being a representative, you may wonder, looking at Rule 3, why couldn't you skip all this block-building, favor-trading nonsense and just bribe the army to take power?

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We must finally turn to taxes and revolts.

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You must understand Rule 2 and how the treasure is raised and used to hold a country together.

108
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If we graph the tax rate of countries versus the number of key supporters the ruler needs, there's a clear relationship.

109
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
More democracy, lower taxes.

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If you're sitting comfortably in a cushy democracy, you may scoff at this, but you are fellow citizens who don't earn enough, don't pay income taxes,

111
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and get rebates, bringing the average tax rate down.

112
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In dictatorships, this doesn't happen. Dictatorships often forgo tax paperwork in favor of just taking wealth directly.

113
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's common for the dictator to force farmers to sell their produce to him for little, then turn around and sell it on the open market,

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
pocketing the difference at an unthinkably high equivalent tax rate.

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So taxes in democracies are low in comparison to dictatorships.

116
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But why do representatives lower their take?

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, cutting taxes is a crowd-pleaser. Dictators have no need to please the crowds,

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and thus can take a large percentage from their poor citizens to pay key supporters.

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But representatives in a democracy can take a smaller percentage from each to pay their key supporters,

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
because their educated, freer citizens are more productive than peasants.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For rulers in a democracy, the more productivity the better,

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
which is why they build universities and hospitals and roads and grant freedoms,

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
not just out of the goodness of their hearts, but because it increases citizen productiveness,

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
which increases treasure for the ruler and their key supporters, even when a lower percentage is taken.

125
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Democracies are better places to live than dictatorships, not because representatives are better people,

126
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
but because their needs happen to be aligned with a large portion of the population.

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The things that make citizens more productive also make their lives better.

128
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone gets highways.

129
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens,

130
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
those who have the fewest keys to power.

131
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common.

132
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Gold or oil or diamonds or similar.

133
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If the wealth of a nation is mostly dug out of the ground, it's a terrible place to live,

134
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because a gold mine can run with dying slaves and still produce great treasure.

135
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oil is harder, but luckily foreign companies can extract and refine it without any citizen involvement.

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
With citizens outside this cycle, they can be ignored, while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power kept loyal.

137
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Thus, we live in a world where the best, smartest democracies are stable,

138
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the worst, richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution.

139
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The resource-rich dictators build roads only from their ports to their resources and from their palace to the airport,

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and the people stay quiet not because this is fine or even because they're scared,

141
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but because the cold truth is starving, disconnected illiterates don't make good revolutionaries.

142
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Now, a middling dictator without resources must, as mentioned before,

143
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thus, two roads won't do, and so he must maintain some minimums of life for the citizens.

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But keeping the workforce somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy makes them more able to revolt.

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Now understand, the romantic image of the people storming the gates and overthrowing their dictator is mostly a fantasy.

147
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If you run a middling dictatorship, the people only storm the palace when the army lets them to remove you

148
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
because you lost control over your keys and are being replaced.

149
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is why, after popular revolts in middling dictatorships, the new ruler is often the same as the old, if not worse.

150
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The people didn't replace the king, the court replaced the king, using the people's protest they let happen to do it.

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The very things a benevolent dictator wants to build to cross this valley take treasure away from the keys to power

152
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and make the citizens more able to revolt, often ending in a stronger ruler less likely to build bridges and more loyal to his keys.

153
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
On the other side, the best democracies are stable, not just because the large number of keys and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt near impossible to organize,

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
but also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture, the high productivity of the citizens.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Plus, those helping the would-be dictator in a democracy know he plans to cull key supporters once in power.

156
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's what a coup is.

157
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So potential key supporters must weigh the probability of surviving the cull and getting the rewards

158
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
versus the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship they helped create.

159
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In a stable democracy, that's a terrible gamble.

160
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Maybe you'll be incredibly wealthy, but probably you'll be dead and have made the lives of everyone you know worse.

161
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The math says no.

162
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Being on the right side of a coup in a dictatorship means having the resources to get you and your family what the peasants lack.

163
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Healthcare, education, quality of life.

164
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is what makes the competition for power so fierce.

165
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But in a democracy, most already have these things, so why risk it?

166
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So the more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation,

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the more the power gets spread out and the more the ruler must maintain the quality of life for those citizens.

168
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The less, the less.

169
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Now, if a stable democracy becomes very poor, or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found,

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the odds of this gamble change and make it more possible for a small group to seize power.

171
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because if the current quality of life is terrible, or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk.

172
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons.

173
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
These rules for rulers explain not only why some men are monsters and others are merciful,

174
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
but everything about politics, from war to foreign aid to political dynasties to corruption.

175
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
All of which we can talk about at another time.

176
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But for now, you aspiring ruler may be disgusted by the world of politics and have decided to avoid it entirely.

177
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But you cannot, for rulers come in many forms.

178
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, kings, presidents and prime ministers, but also deans, dons, mayors, chairs, chiefs.

179
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
These rules apply to all and explain their actions.

180
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
From the CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate who must keep his board happy,

181
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
to the chair of the smallest homeowners association managing votes and spending membership fees.

182
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You cannot escape structures of power.

183
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can only turn a blind eye to understanding them.

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And if you ever want the change you dream about, there's a zeroth rule you cannot ignore.

185
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Without power, you can affect nothing.

186
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You may not like these rules, but surely, better you on the throne than someone else.

187
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And who knows, maybe you'll be different.
