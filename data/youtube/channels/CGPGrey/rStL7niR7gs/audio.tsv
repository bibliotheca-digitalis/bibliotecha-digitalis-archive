0	6000	Do you want to rule? Do you see the problems in your country and know how to fix them?
6000	10500	If only you had the power to do so. Well, you've come to the right place.
10500	14900	But before we begin this lesson in political power, ask yourself,
14900	22500	why don't rulers see as clearly as you, instead acting in such selfish, self-destructive, short-sighted ways?
22500	28500	Are they stupid, these most powerful people in the world, or is it something else?
28500	33000	The throne looks omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems.
33000	37000	Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you.
37000	43000	Accept that, or turn back now, before we discuss the rules for rulers.
45000	50500	No matter how bright the rays of any Sun King, no man rules alone.
50500	57000	A king can't build roads alone, can't enforce laws alone, can't defend the nation or himself alone.
57000	64500	The power of a king is not to act, but to get others to act on his behalf, using the treasure in his vaults.
64500	71500	A king needs an army and someone to run it, treasure and someone to collect it, law and someone to enforce it.
71500	77000	The individuals needed to make the necessary things happen are the king's keys to power.
77000	84500	All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands.
84500	89000	In a dictatorship where might makes right, the number of keys to power is small.
89000	93500	Perhaps only a dozen generals, bureaucrats and regional leaders.
93500	101000	Sway them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but never forget, displease them and they will replace you.
101000	108000	Now all countries lie on a spectrum, from those where the ruler needs few key supporters to those where the ruler needs many.
108500	112500	This foundation of power is why countries are different.
112500	116500	Be it many keys or few, the rules are the same.
116500	120500	First, get the key supporters on your side.
120500	124500	With them, you have the power to act. You have everything.
124500	126500	Without them, you have nothing.
126500	133000	Now, in order to keep those keys to power, you must second, control the treasure.
133000	141000	You must make sure your treasure is raised and distributed to you for all your hard work and to the keys needed to keep your position.
141000	152500	This is your true work as a ruler, figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources so as not to topple the house of cards upon which your throne sits.
152500	161500	Now you, aspiring benevolent dictator, may want to help your citizens, but your control of the treasure is what attracts rivals.
161500	164000	So you must keep those keys loyal.
164000	168500	But there's only so much treasure in your vault, so much wealth your kingdom produces.
168500	175000	So beware, every bit of treasure spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty.
175000	183500	Thus, doing the right thing, spending the wealth of the nation on the citizens of the nation, hands a tool of power acquisition to your rivals.
183500	192000	The treasure poured into roads and universities and hospitals is treasure a rival can promise to key supporters if only they switch sides.
192000	199000	Benevolent dictators can spend their take on the citizens, but the keys must get their rewards.
199000	208500	For even if you have gathered the most loyal, angelic supporters, they have the same problem as you, just one level down.
208500	212000	Being a key to power is a position of power.
212000	216000	They too must watch out for rivals from below or above.
216000	221500	Thus, the treasure they get must also be spent to maintain their position.
221500	235000	The loyal and dim may stay by your side no matter what, but smart key supporters will always watch the balance of power, ready to change allegiance if you look to be the loser in a shifting web of alliances.
235500	246500	In countries where the keys are few, the rewards are great, and when violence rules, the most ruthless are attracted, and angels that build good works will lose to devils that don't.
246500	254500	So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty in dictatorial organizations of all kinds is everything.
254500	256500	For the ruler, anyway.
256500	264500	Thus, the dictatorship exposed, a king who needs his court to raise the treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure.
264500	270000	This is the self-sustaining core of power. All outside is secondary.
270000	273500	Now a king with many key supporters has real problems.
273500	279500	Not just their expense, but also their competing needs and rivalries are difficult to balance.
279500	287500	The more complicated the social and financial web between them all, the more able a rival is to sway a critical mass.
287500	292500	The more key supporters a ruler has on average, the shorter their reign.
292500	298000	Which brings us to the third rule for rulers. Minimize key supporters.
298000	304500	If a key in your court becomes unnecessary, his skills no longer required, you must kick him out.
304500	313000	After a successful coup, the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power while working with the underlings of the previous dictator.
313000	316500	Which, from the outside, seems a terrible idea.
316500	319000	Why abandon your fellow revolutionaries?
319000	321500	Are the old dictator's supporters not a danger?
321500	327000	But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it.
327000	335000	Having someone on the payroll who was vital in the past but useless now is the same as spending money on the citizens.
335000	338000	Treasure wasted on the irrelevant.
338000	345500	And by definition, a dictator that pulls off a coup has promised greater treasure to those switching sides.
345500	351000	The size of the vault has not changed, so the treasure must be split among fewer.
351000	360500	A dictator that sways the right keys, takes control of the treasure, cuts unnecessary spending, kills unnecessary keys will have a long and successful career.
360500	368500	Seeing the structure unveiled, you might be excited to get started and control a country to the benefit of you and your cronies.
368500	377500	Or you might be exhausted, wishing to do good, but seeing the structural difficulties now turn to democracy for salvation.
377500	381000	So let us discuss rulers as representatives.
382500	389000	You, again, might have grand dreams of the utopia you wish to build, but no man rules alone.
389000	392000	And never more so than in democracy.
392000	397000	Presidents and prime ministers must negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa.
397000	400500	And they all have their own key supporters to manage.
400500	407000	In a well-designed democracy, power is fractured among many and is taken not with force, but with words.
407000	416000	Meaning you must get thousands or millions of citizens to, if not like you on election day, at least like you better than the alternative.
416000	424500	With so many voters and such fractured power, it's impossible to, as a dictator would, follow these rules and buy loyalty.
424500	426500	Or is it? Of course not.
426500	433500	Don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires, but instead as divided into blocks.
433500	436500	The elderly, or homeowners, or business owners, or the poor.
436500	439000	Blocks you can reward as a group.
439000	450000	Democracies have wildly complicated tax codes and laws, not as accident, but as reward for the blocks that get and keep the ruling representatives in power.
450000	460000	Farming subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with the food a nation needs, but entirely with how key the vote of the farming block is.
460000	465000	Countries where farmers' votes don't swing elections don't have farming subsidies.
465000	471000	If a block doesn't vote, such as younger citizens, then no need to divert rewards their way.
471000	475000	Even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power.
475000	477000	Which is good news for you.
477000	483000	One less block to sway and the treasure you give your key blocks has to come from somewhere.
483000	490000	If you want long years in office, Rule 3 is your friend in a democracy just as much as a dictatorship.
490000	495000	You can't eliminate those who don't vote for you, but there is still much you can do.
495000	500000	Once in power, make it easier for your key blocks to vote and harder for others.
500000	506000	Establish voting systems that reduce the number of blocks you need to win, the more rivals you get.
506000	507000	Very handy indeed.
507000	518000	Draw election borders to pre-determine the results for you or your cronies, and have party pre-elections with Byzantine rules to determine who blocks even can vote for.
518000	522000	Mix and match the above for even better power perpetuation.
522000	528000	When approval ratings couldn't be lower, yet re-election rates couldn't be higher, you'll know you've succeeded.
528000	531000	Now, enough with thinking about the citizens.
531000	540000	Even in a democracy, there still are very influential individual key supporters you need on your side.
540000	545000	Because their money or influence or favors keeps you in power.
545000	558000	While you can't just promise to give them treasure directly, as a dictator would, you can create loopholes for their investments, pass laws that they've written, or print get-out-of-jail-free cards for their actions.
558000	562000	Not a wheelbarrow of gold to the door, but contracts for their business.
562000	568000	You, as a ruler, do have roads to build or computers to maintain or buildings to reconstruct.
568000	571000	No man rules alone, after all.
571000	575000	Or you could take the moral path and ignore the big keys.
575000	579000	But you'll fight against those who didn't. Good luck with that.
579000	586000	Corruption is not some kind of petty crime, but rather a tool of power in democracies and dictatorships.
586000	588000	But more on that another time.
588000	592000	So accept the favors, sway the key blocks, and you will get into power.
592000	597000	Ruling with actions that look contradictory and stupid to those who don't understand the game.
597000	603000	Privately helping a powerful industry you publicly denounced or passing laws that hurt a block that voted for you.
603000	613000	But your job isn't to have a consistent, understandable ruling policy, but to balance the interests of your keys to power, big and small.
613000	615000	That is how you stay in office.
615000	626000	Now with all this headache of being a representative, you may wonder, looking at Rule 3, why couldn't you skip all this block-building, favor-trading nonsense and just bribe the army to take power?
626000	630000	We must finally turn to taxes and revolts.
630000	637000	You must understand Rule 2 and how the treasure is raised and used to hold a country together.
637000	643000	If we graph the tax rate of countries versus the number of key supporters the ruler needs, there's a clear relationship.
643000	646000	More democracy, lower taxes.
646000	655000	If you're sitting comfortably in a cushy democracy, you may scoff at this, but you are fellow citizens who don't earn enough, don't pay income taxes,
655000	659000	and get rebates, bringing the average tax rate down.
659000	666000	In dictatorships, this doesn't happen. Dictatorships often forgo tax paperwork in favor of just taking wealth directly.
666000	674000	It's common for the dictator to force farmers to sell their produce to him for little, then turn around and sell it on the open market,
674000	678000	pocketing the difference at an unthinkably high equivalent tax rate.
678000	683000	So taxes in democracies are low in comparison to dictatorships.
683000	687000	But why do representatives lower their take?
687000	692000	Well, cutting taxes is a crowd-pleaser. Dictators have no need to please the crowds,
692000	697000	and thus can take a large percentage from their poor citizens to pay key supporters.
697000	704000	But representatives in a democracy can take a smaller percentage from each to pay their key supporters,
704000	709000	because their educated, freer citizens are more productive than peasants.
710000	714000	For rulers in a democracy, the more productivity the better,
714000	719000	which is why they build universities and hospitals and roads and grant freedoms,
719000	725000	not just out of the goodness of their hearts, but because it increases citizen productiveness,
725000	733000	which increases treasure for the ruler and their key supporters, even when a lower percentage is taken.
733000	739000	Democracies are better places to live than dictatorships, not because representatives are better people,
739000	746000	but because their needs happen to be aligned with a large portion of the population.
746000	751000	The things that make citizens more productive also make their lives better.
751000	756000	Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone gets highways.
756000	761000	The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens,
761000	764000	those who have the fewest keys to power.
764000	768000	This explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common.
768000	771000	Gold or oil or diamonds or similar.
771000	777000	If the wealth of a nation is mostly dug out of the ground, it's a terrible place to live,
777000	784000	because a gold mine can run with dying slaves and still produce great treasure.
784000	790000	Oil is harder, but luckily foreign companies can extract and refine it without any citizen involvement.
790000	798000	With citizens outside this cycle, they can be ignored, while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power kept loyal.
798000	803000	Thus, we live in a world where the best, smartest democracies are stable,
803000	809000	the worst, richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution.
809000	815000	The resource-rich dictators build roads only from their ports to their resources and from their palace to the airport,
815000	820000	and the people stay quiet not because this is fine or even because they're scared,
820000	827000	but because the cold truth is starving, disconnected illiterates don't make good revolutionaries.
827000	831000	Now, a middling dictator without resources must, as mentioned before,
831000	837000	take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers.
837000	844000	Thus, two roads won't do, and so he must maintain some minimums of life for the citizens.
844000	853000	But keeping the workforce somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy makes them more able to revolt.
853000	859000	Now understand, the romantic image of the people storming the gates and overthrowing their dictator is mostly a fantasy.
859000	867000	If you run a middling dictatorship, the people only storm the palace when the army lets them to remove you
867000	871000	because you lost control over your keys and are being replaced.
871000	879000	This is why, after popular revolts in middling dictatorships, the new ruler is often the same as the old, if not worse.
879000	888000	The people didn't replace the king, the court replaced the king, using the people's protest they let happen to do it.
888000	895000	The very things a benevolent dictator wants to build to cross this valley take treasure away from the keys to power
895000	904000	and make the citizens more able to revolt, often ending in a stronger ruler less likely to build bridges and more loyal to his keys.
904000	914000	On the other side, the best democracies are stable, not just because the large number of keys and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt near impossible to organize,
914000	922000	but also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture, the high productivity of the citizens.
922000	930000	Plus, those helping the would-be dictator in a democracy know he plans to cull key supporters once in power.
930000	932000	That's what a coup is.
932000	938000	So potential key supporters must weigh the probability of surviving the cull and getting the rewards
938000	943000	versus the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship they helped create.
943000	946000	In a stable democracy, that's a terrible gamble.
946000	953000	Maybe you'll be incredibly wealthy, but probably you'll be dead and have made the lives of everyone you know worse.
953000	955000	The math says no.
955000	962000	Being on the right side of a coup in a dictatorship means having the resources to get you and your family what the peasants lack.
962000	964000	Healthcare, education, quality of life.
964000	968000	This is what makes the competition for power so fierce.
968000	972000	But in a democracy, most already have these things, so why risk it?
972000	976000	So the more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation,
976000	983000	the more the power gets spread out and the more the ruler must maintain the quality of life for those citizens.
983000	985000	The less, the less.
985000	993000	Now, if a stable democracy becomes very poor, or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found,
993000	1000000	the odds of this gamble change and make it more possible for a small group to seize power.
1000000	1009000	Because if the current quality of life is terrible, or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk.
1009000	1013000	When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons.
1015000	1021000	These rules for rulers explain not only why some men are monsters and others are merciful,
1021000	1027000	but everything about politics, from war to foreign aid to political dynasties to corruption.
1027000	1030000	All of which we can talk about at another time.
1030000	1037000	But for now, you aspiring ruler may be disgusted by the world of politics and have decided to avoid it entirely.
1037000	1040000	But you cannot, for rulers come in many forms.
1040000	1046000	Yes, kings, presidents and prime ministers, but also deans, dons, mayors, chairs, chiefs.
1046000	1050000	These rules apply to all and explain their actions.
1050000	1055000	From the CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate who must keep his board happy,
1055000	1061000	to the chair of the smallest homeowners association managing votes and spending membership fees.
1061000	1064000	You cannot escape structures of power.
1064000	1068000	You can only turn a blind eye to understanding them.
1068000	1074000	And if you ever want the change you dream about, there's a zeroth rule you cannot ignore.
1074000	1078000	Without power, you can affect nothing.
1078000	1084000	You may not like these rules, but surely, better you on the throne than someone else.
1084000	1087000	And who knows, maybe you'll be different.
