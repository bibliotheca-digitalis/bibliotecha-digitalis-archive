1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Challenge. Can you post another Q&A within six months?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No. I cannot.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What are your favorite and least favorite kinds of questions to answer?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A long time ago, in a state far away, I did an event with some friends

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where my job was to pick questions from the audience.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Right before the show started, Pretty Derek turned to me and said,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Please don't pick superlatives.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I said, What's a superlative?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Best. Worst. Favorite. Least favorite.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Ahhh. The show begins, and those were probably half the questions in the bowl.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But Derek, having had much more experience with Q&As, was totally right.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
On the spot, those questions are pretty hard to answer.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But also, as I've grown up, I've found the whole concept of a favorite X

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
has become more abstract and situational.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Favorite things seem to be more important the younger you are,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which makes sense, because you don't really know who you are

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and so define yourself by the world around you.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And it's also practice for the tribal affiliation games we never escape, even as adults.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Which can make trying to answer these questions super unfun

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
when people take the answer way too seriously.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So a question about my favorite is by far my least favorite,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but Fahrenheit is still my favorite. Come at me.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Anyway, if you're ever at a show or submitting questions to a Q&A,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to raise the odds of getting an answer, try turning it a bit.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, whose videos do you watch the most?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's an easy answer. Red Letter Media by a mile.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I started with the highly produced Gateway Classics

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and, over the years, progressed to mainlining the hardcore stuff.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's hard to say why I so like watching guys I don't know

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
view movies and instructional videos I never will,

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but it's strangely comforting and engaging.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And let's not talk about how many hundreds of hours of Red Letter Media

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've had on while animating since starting my own channel.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm glad YouTube doesn't track and time shame,

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
unlike some other services I could mention.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I also picked this question because I can't bear watching Red Letter Media

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
keep inching closer to a million subscribers any longer.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Can we get these guys their gold play button already?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Click and subscribe.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's your favorite joke you've hidden in a video?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mmm.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm gonna let this one slide because, oh man, do I love hiding stuff in videos.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And it brings me tremendous joy when people find all the things.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
For example, have you found all the bees?

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's a lot of them now.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Again, no favorites, but a recent one I'm pleased with

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is this dude in the airport reading The Hobbit,

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and then the Fellowship of the Ring, and then the entire Rings trilogy,

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
implying the wait to board that flight was really long.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Favorite integer? No, I don't.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Favorite color? I shouldn't have.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Favorite magic colors? Well, black and blue, obviously,

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but no getting around this one.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Favorite YouTuber? You know these people are my friends.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It would be really weird to pick a favorite podcast.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, I already explained.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Favorite movie? Favorite Liberian county flag?

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Favorite world leader? You can't be serious.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Favorite law of physics? Favorite conspiracy theory?

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Favorite tree? What?

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On a scale of 1 to 10, what is your favorite color of the alphabet?

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Uh, no. Okay, this is my fault. I shouldn't have opened this door.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is your favorite spelling of favorite?

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, enough of that.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is the most persistent physical object you own?

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ooh, that's a good question.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Like, it must be my original wedding ring.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't think of an object that's been with me longer.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I currently wear a second edition, which will eventually become

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the third most persistent object in my life.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's the second most persistent?

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, while moving off as recently,

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I found it hiding in an envelope at the bottom of a box.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sure, I had thrown it away. Positive, in fact.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But somehow, this specter evaded my many moves and purges.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have no idea how it shadowed me, hiding nearby for a decade.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, to explain this thing, back in the long ago,

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I quit teaching, packed all my belongings, bundled my savings,

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
heading off into the sunset with the sure knowledge

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was to achieve the project of my life.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
To escape the system. To become self-employed. To be free.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I... totally failed.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Burned through my savings and returned to London,

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
humbled, having to find another teaching job.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That year of failure was... not a great time,

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and what I thought would be my molymere with which to forge my new life

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
was instead a cursed object.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This original MacBook Air.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The laptop sold on its thinness and lightness,

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the machine I spent a significant portion of my savings on,

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
as it seemed perfect for the life of peregrination before me.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This laptop was a disaster,

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
with catastrophic thermal problems making it run painfully slow.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And during this dark time, I lived in Hawaii with family to save money.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now, Hawaii doesn't believe in air conditioning,

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
because the island is paradise and the weather is perfect. It isn't.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have such a visceral memory of being inescapably hot and sweaty,

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
trying to work while heat poured out from the keyboard,

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
melting me, melting my dreams.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I thought I had long gotten rid of this totem of the absolute failure of a younger man.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But it's weird. Now that it's been so long,

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I kind of want to mount it on my office wall as hashtag never forget.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't think I really will, but I haven't thrown it out yet.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What is one topic you will never discuss?

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How am I to answer this question?

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Is there still hope for the Catan video?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What are your tips on improving one's ability to read?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Spend less time on the Tweetbooks and Snapstagrams.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I kind of left a lot of the internet temporarily a while back.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know if you've heard.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've only made a vlog and talked about it repeatedly on my podcasts.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Anyway, I think internet comments train my brain to have a short attention span.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So less of the Reddit equals more of the books,

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
which I think is a net positive.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But I do miss the wild west of the internet.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sometimes I can hear the memes calling me.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, anything you want to have more of in your life, like reading,

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
also try to decide ahead of time what you're going to have less of to make space for it.

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Saying you want to do more X without also saying what you want to do less of is a recipe for failure.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In life, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How come you don't mention D&D more often?

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Despite, as you might imagine, the child me being right in the demographic for D&D,

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I never played it, so that's why I don't mention it.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The closest I ever got was Baby's first D&D, Hero Quest,

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
which I loved playing as the Dungeon Master.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Does it frustrate you how all the months have different numbers of days?

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It makes spreadsheets very untidy, so yes.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Have any answers from the previous Q&As changed?

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Man, every time this gets asked, I have more videos to check.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This time through, I noticed I previously mentioned a proportional Senate

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
as one of my top three changes to the Constitution,

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
which was totally surprising to current me to see.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Maybe past me meant a Senate run by MMP?

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If so, I didn't make that very clear.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Anyway, I'm still pretty firmly against the Electoral College,

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
not because of the original idea, but because of what has changed in the last centuries.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But the House and Senate system seems like a pretty good way

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to try to balance the power of the states and the people.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's your favorite exit?

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The exit of my people.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The Irish exit.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Goodbyes are uncomfortable.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When you're done, you're done.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Just go.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Poof.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Poof.
