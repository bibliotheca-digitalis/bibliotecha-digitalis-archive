00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Challenge. Can you post another Q&A within six months?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
No. I cannot.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
What are your favorite and least favorite kinds of questions to answer?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
A long time ago, in a state far away, I did an event with some friends

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
where my job was to pick questions from the audience.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Right before the show started, Pretty Derek turned to me and said,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Please don't pick superlatives.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
And I said, What's a superlative?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Best. Worst. Favorite. Least favorite.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Ahhh. The show begins, and those were probably half the questions in the bowl.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
But Derek, having had much more experience with Q&As, was totally right.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
On the spot, those questions are pretty hard to answer.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
But also, as I've grown up, I've found the whole concept of a favorite X

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
has become more abstract and situational.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Favorite things seem to be more important the younger you are,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
which makes sense, because you don't really know who you are

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
and so define yourself by the world around you.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
And it's also practice for the tribal affiliation games we never escape, even as adults.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Which can make trying to answer these questions super unfun

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
when people take the answer way too seriously.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So a question about my favorite is by far my least favorite,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
but Fahrenheit is still my favorite. Come at me.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Anyway, if you're ever at a show or submitting questions to a Q&A,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
to raise the odds of getting an answer, try turning it a bit.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
For example, whose videos do you watch the most?

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
That's an easy answer. Red Letter Media by a mile.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I started with the highly produced Gateway Classics

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
and, over the years, progressed to mainlining the hardcore stuff.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
It's hard to say why I so like watching guys I don't know

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
view movies and instructional videos I never will,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
but it's strangely comforting and engaging.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And let's not talk about how many hundreds of hours of Red Letter Media

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I've had on while animating since starting my own channel.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm glad YouTube doesn't track and time shame,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
unlike some other services I could mention.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I also picked this question because I can't bear watching Red Letter Media

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
keep inching closer to a million subscribers any longer.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Can we get these guys their gold play button already?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Click and subscribe.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
What's your favorite joke you've hidden in a video?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Mmm.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm gonna let this one slide because, oh man, do I love hiding stuff in videos.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And it brings me tremendous joy when people find all the things.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
For example, have you found all the bees?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
There's a lot of them now.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Again, no favorites, but a recent one I'm pleased with

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
is this dude in the airport reading The Hobbit,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
and then the Fellowship of the Ring, and then the entire Rings trilogy,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
implying the wait to board that flight was really long.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Favorite integer? No, I don't.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Favorite color? I shouldn't have.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Favorite magic colors? Well, black and blue, obviously,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
but no getting around this one.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Favorite YouTuber? You know these people are my friends.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It would be really weird to pick a favorite podcast.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
No, I already explained.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Favorite movie? Favorite Liberian county flag?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Favorite world leader? You can't be serious.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Favorite law of physics? Favorite conspiracy theory?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Favorite tree? What?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
On a scale of 1 to 10, what is your favorite color of the alphabet?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Uh, no. Okay, this is my fault. I shouldn't have opened this door.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
What is your favorite spelling of favorite?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Okay, enough of that.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
What is the most persistent physical object you own?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Ooh, that's a good question.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Like, it must be my original wedding ring.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I can't think of an object that's been with me longer.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I currently wear a second edition, which will eventually become

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
the third most persistent object in my life.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
What's the second most persistent?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, while moving off as recently,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I found it hiding in an envelope at the bottom of a box.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Sure, I had thrown it away. Positive, in fact.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
But somehow, this specter evaded my many moves and purges.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
I have no idea how it shadowed me, hiding nearby for a decade.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
So, to explain this thing, back in the long ago,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I quit teaching, packed all my belongings, bundled my savings,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
heading off into the sunset with the sure knowledge

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I was to achieve the project of my life.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
To escape the system. To become self-employed. To be free.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
And I... totally failed.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Burned through my savings and returned to London,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
humbled, having to find another teaching job.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
That year of failure was... not a great time,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
and what I thought would be my molymere with which to forge my new life

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
was instead a cursed object.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
This original MacBook Air.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
The laptop sold on its thinness and lightness,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
the machine I spent a significant portion of my savings on,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
as it seemed perfect for the life of peregrination before me.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
This laptop was a disaster,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
with catastrophic thermal problems making it run painfully slow.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
And during this dark time, I lived in Hawaii with family to save money.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Now, Hawaii doesn't believe in air conditioning,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
because the island is paradise and the weather is perfect. It isn't.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I have such a visceral memory of being inescapably hot and sweaty,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
trying to work while heat poured out from the keyboard,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
melting me, melting my dreams.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I thought I had long gotten rid of this totem of the absolute failure of a younger man.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
But it's weird. Now that it's been so long,

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I kind of want to mount it on my office wall as hashtag never forget.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I don't think I really will, but I haven't thrown it out yet.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
What is one topic you will never discuss?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
How am I to answer this question?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Is there still hope for the Catan video?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
No.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
What are your tips on improving one's ability to read?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Spend less time on the Tweetbooks and Snapstagrams.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I kind of left a lot of the internet temporarily a while back.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't know if you've heard.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I've only made a vlog and talked about it repeatedly on my podcasts.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Anyway, I think internet comments train my brain to have a short attention span.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So less of the Reddit equals more of the books,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
which I think is a net positive.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
But I do miss the wild west of the internet.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Sometimes I can hear the memes calling me.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Now, anything you want to have more of in your life, like reading,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
also try to decide ahead of time what you're going to have less of to make space for it.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Saying you want to do more X without also saying what you want to do less of is a recipe for failure.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
In life, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
How come you don't mention D&D more often?

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Despite, as you might imagine, the child me being right in the demographic for D&D,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I never played it, so that's why I don't mention it.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
The closest I ever got was Baby's first D&D, Hero Quest,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
which I loved playing as the Dungeon Master.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Does it frustrate you how all the months have different numbers of days?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It makes spreadsheets very untidy, so yes.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Have any answers from the previous Q&As changed?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Man, every time this gets asked, I have more videos to check.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
This time through, I noticed I previously mentioned a proportional Senate

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
as one of my top three changes to the Constitution,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
which was totally surprising to current me to see.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Maybe past me meant a Senate run by MMP?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
If so, I didn't make that very clear.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Anyway, I'm still pretty firmly against the Electoral College,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
not because of the original idea, but because of what has changed in the last centuries.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But the House and Senate system seems like a pretty good way

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
to try to balance the power of the states and the people.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
What's your favorite exit?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
The exit of my people.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
The Irish exit.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Goodbyes are uncomfortable.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
When you're done, you're done.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Just go.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Poof.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Poof.
