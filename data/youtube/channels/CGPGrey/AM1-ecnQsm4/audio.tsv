0	3000	Challenge. Can you post another Q&A within six months?
3000	5000	No. I cannot.
5000	8000	What are your favorite and least favorite kinds of questions to answer?
8000	11000	A long time ago, in a state far away, I did an event with some friends
11000	13000	where my job was to pick questions from the audience.
13000	16000	Right before the show started, Pretty Derek turned to me and said,
16000	18000	Please don't pick superlatives.
18000	20000	And I said, What's a superlative?
20000	23000	Best. Worst. Favorite. Least favorite.
23000	27000	Ahhh. The show begins, and those were probably half the questions in the bowl.
27000	31000	But Derek, having had much more experience with Q&As, was totally right.
31000	34000	On the spot, those questions are pretty hard to answer.
34000	38000	But also, as I've grown up, I've found the whole concept of a favorite X
38000	41000	has become more abstract and situational.
41000	43000	Favorite things seem to be more important the younger you are,
43000	46000	which makes sense, because you don't really know who you are
46000	48000	and so define yourself by the world around you.
48000	53000	And it's also practice for the tribal affiliation games we never escape, even as adults.
53000	56000	Which can make trying to answer these questions super unfun
56000	59000	when people take the answer way too seriously.
59000	61000	So a question about my favorite is by far my least favorite,
61000	63000	but Fahrenheit is still my favorite. Come at me.
63000	66000	Anyway, if you're ever at a show or submitting questions to a Q&A,
66000	70000	to raise the odds of getting an answer, try turning it a bit.
70000	72000	For example, whose videos do you watch the most?
72000	75000	That's an easy answer. Red Letter Media by a mile.
75000	77000	I started with the highly produced Gateway Classics
77000	80000	and, over the years, progressed to mainlining the hardcore stuff.
80000	83000	It's hard to say why I so like watching guys I don't know
83000	86000	view movies and instructional videos I never will,
86000	89000	but it's strangely comforting and engaging.
89000	92000	And let's not talk about how many hundreds of hours of Red Letter Media
92000	95000	I've had on while animating since starting my own channel.
95000	98000	I'm glad YouTube doesn't track and time shame,
98000	100000	unlike some other services I could mention.
100000	103000	I also picked this question because I can't bear watching Red Letter Media
103000	107000	keep inching closer to a million subscribers any longer.
107000	109000	Can we get these guys their gold play button already?
109000	110000	Click and subscribe.
110000	112000	What's your favorite joke you've hidden in a video?
112000	113000	Mmm.
113000	117000	I'm gonna let this one slide because, oh man, do I love hiding stuff in videos.
117000	120000	And it brings me tremendous joy when people find all the things.
120000	122000	For example, have you found all the bees?
122000	123000	There's a lot of them now.
123000	126000	Again, no favorites, but a recent one I'm pleased with
126000	129000	is this dude in the airport reading The Hobbit,
129000	133000	and then the Fellowship of the Ring, and then the entire Rings trilogy,
133000	136000	implying the wait to board that flight was really long.
136000	138000	Favorite integer? No, I don't.
138000	139000	Favorite color? I shouldn't have.
139000	142000	Favorite magic colors? Well, black and blue, obviously,
142000	143000	but no getting around this one.
143000	145000	Favorite YouTuber? You know these people are my friends.
145000	147000	It would be really weird to pick a favorite podcast.
147000	148000	No, I already explained.
148000	150000	Favorite movie? Favorite Liberian county flag?
150000	152000	Favorite world leader? You can't be serious.
152000	154000	Favorite law of physics? Favorite conspiracy theory?
154000	155000	Favorite tree? What?
155000	158000	On a scale of 1 to 10, what is your favorite color of the alphabet?
158000	161000	Uh, no. Okay, this is my fault. I shouldn't have opened this door.
161000	162000	What is your favorite spelling of favorite?
162000	163000	Okay, enough of that.
163000	166000	What is the most persistent physical object you own?
166000	167000	Ooh, that's a good question.
167000	169000	Like, it must be my original wedding ring.
169000	171000	I can't think of an object that's been with me longer.
171000	174000	I currently wear a second edition, which will eventually become
174000	176000	the third most persistent object in my life.
178000	180000	What's the second most persistent?
180000	182000	Well, while moving off as recently,
182000	186000	I found it hiding in an envelope at the bottom of a box.
186000	189000	Sure, I had thrown it away. Positive, in fact.
189000	193000	But somehow, this specter evaded my many moves and purges.
193000	198000	I have no idea how it shadowed me, hiding nearby for a decade.
198000	201000	So, to explain this thing, back in the long ago,
201000	204000	I quit teaching, packed all my belongings, bundled my savings,
204000	207000	heading off into the sunset with the sure knowledge
207000	209000	I was to achieve the project of my life.
209000	213000	To escape the system. To become self-employed. To be free.
213000	216000	And I... totally failed.
216000	218000	Burned through my savings and returned to London,
218000	221000	humbled, having to find another teaching job.
221000	224000	That year of failure was... not a great time,
224000	228000	and what I thought would be my molymere with which to forge my new life
228000	230000	was instead a cursed object.
230000	233000	This original MacBook Air.
233000	235000	The laptop sold on its thinness and lightness,
235000	238000	the machine I spent a significant portion of my savings on,
238000	241000	as it seemed perfect for the life of peregrination before me.
241000	244000	This laptop was a disaster,
244000	248000	with catastrophic thermal problems making it run painfully slow.
248000	252000	And during this dark time, I lived in Hawaii with family to save money.
252000	255000	Now, Hawaii doesn't believe in air conditioning,
255000	259000	because the island is paradise and the weather is perfect. It isn't.
259000	264000	I have such a visceral memory of being inescapably hot and sweaty,
264000	268000	trying to work while heat poured out from the keyboard,
268000	271000	melting me, melting my dreams.
271000	276000	I thought I had long gotten rid of this totem of the absolute failure of a younger man.
276000	278000	But it's weird. Now that it's been so long,
278000	282000	I kind of want to mount it on my office wall as hashtag never forget.
282000	285000	I don't think I really will, but I haven't thrown it out yet.
285000	287000	What is one topic you will never discuss?
287000	290000	How am I to answer this question?
290000	292000	Is there still hope for the Catan video?
295000	296000	No.
296000	298000	What are your tips on improving one's ability to read?
298000	301000	Spend less time on the Tweetbooks and Snapstagrams.
301000	305000	I kind of left a lot of the internet temporarily a while back.
305000	306000	I don't know if you've heard.
306000	309000	I've only made a vlog and talked about it repeatedly on my podcasts.
309000	313000	Anyway, I think internet comments train my brain to have a short attention span.
313000	316000	So less of the Reddit equals more of the books,
316000	318000	which I think is a net positive.
318000	321000	But I do miss the wild west of the internet.
321000	324000	Sometimes I can hear the memes calling me.
324000	327000	Now, anything you want to have more of in your life, like reading,
327000	331000	also try to decide ahead of time what you're going to have less of to make space for it.
331000	336000	Saying you want to do more X without also saying what you want to do less of is a recipe for failure.
336000	339000	In life, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.
339000	341000	How come you don't mention D&D more often?
341000	346000	Despite, as you might imagine, the child me being right in the demographic for D&D,
346000	349000	I never played it, so that's why I don't mention it.
349000	353000	The closest I ever got was Baby's first D&D, Hero Quest,
353000	356000	which I loved playing as the Dungeon Master.
356000	359000	Does it frustrate you how all the months have different numbers of days?
359000	361000	It makes spreadsheets very untidy, so yes.
361000	364000	Have any answers from the previous Q&As changed?
364000	367000	Man, every time this gets asked, I have more videos to check.
367000	370000	This time through, I noticed I previously mentioned a proportional Senate
370000	373000	as one of my top three changes to the Constitution,
373000	376000	which was totally surprising to current me to see.
376000	379000	Maybe past me meant a Senate run by MMP?
379000	381000	If so, I didn't make that very clear.
381000	384000	Anyway, I'm still pretty firmly against the Electoral College,
384000	387000	not because of the original idea, but because of what has changed in the last centuries.
387000	390000	But the House and Senate system seems like a pretty good way
390000	393000	to try to balance the power of the states and the people.
393000	394000	What's your favorite exit?
394000	395000	The exit of my people.
395000	396000	The Irish exit.
396000	398000	Goodbyes are uncomfortable.
398000	399000	When you're done, you're done.
399000	400000	Just go.
401000	402000	Poof.
417000	420000	Poof.
