00:00.000 --> 00:04.380
Hello internet, we need to talk about locks, the physical and the digital.

00:04.380 --> 00:07.760
In the physical world, locks aren't as good as you think they are.

00:07.760 --> 00:13.480
The lock on your door stops worries, not burglars, as two minutes of searching will reveal.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.420
Spend more, get more, but all fail with tools and time enough.

00:17.420 --> 00:21.860
That physical locks are bad at locking mostly doesn't matter in normal life because burglars

00:21.860 --> 00:24.140
are constrained by the physical world.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.940
A burglar must cruise the neighborhood, spending their time to pick a target, which makes a

00:27.940 --> 00:31.460
house that looks secure most of the way toward being secure.

00:31.460 --> 00:35.700
Each target house can then only be attacked one at a time and comes with a risk of being

00:35.700 --> 00:37.700
physically caught in the act.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.300
But digital is different.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.240
The constraints of the physical no longer apply.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.100
On the internet, a digital lock must protect you from not just the neighborhood burglar

00:46.100 --> 00:52.420
but all burglars everywhere, for on the internet, there's no such thing as distance.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.180
Internet burglars don't crack digital locks personally, they build burglar bots that try

00:56.180 --> 00:59.840
millions of combinations just to see what opens.

00:59.840 --> 01:04.300
One lock down the street or a country full on the other side of the world, it's all the

01:04.300 --> 01:05.300
same.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.940
Actually, other side of the world is better.

01:06.940 --> 01:11.960
A dude in East Whateverlandia stealing your identity has a near-zero chance of getting

01:11.960 --> 01:12.960
caught.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.560
This is bad news, but thanks to mathematics, digital locks can be made unbreakable.

01:17.560 --> 01:23.020
This is encryption, a digital lock that, without the password, cannot be opened.

01:23.020 --> 01:27.460
Burglar bots will plow through all the possibilities but a secure password will take longer than

01:27.460 --> 01:29.780
the heat death of the universe to guess.

01:29.780 --> 01:34.020
No password, no entry, no matter how much of a lead hacker your mom is.

01:34.020 --> 01:36.460
Your private files stay private.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.860
Which might just be the greatest social good mathematics has done mankind.

01:40.860 --> 01:45.460
But it's easy to imagine unbreakable digital locks as bad news.

01:45.460 --> 01:50.340
Maximum lazy ticking time bomb, the location and off code of which are locked on the phone

01:50.340 --> 01:51.340
of a dead man.

01:51.340 --> 01:55.820
Now, were the information on a piece of paper in a safe room, no problem.

01:55.820 --> 01:59.740
In the physical world, if you can't crack the lock, then you crack the wall.

01:59.740 --> 02:05.740
Society agrees under this scenario it's reasonable for police to get in no matter what it takes.

02:05.740 --> 02:11.860
Note, this means real world locks aren't just physically weak, but also legally weak.

02:11.860 --> 02:16.540
We could live in a world with privacy laws that forbade police to break into all locks

02:16.540 --> 02:19.980
no matter how flimsy, but we don't, cause that'd be dumb.

02:19.980 --> 02:20.980
Hmm.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.340
This is where gears turn in government heads.

02:24.340 --> 02:29.980
If digital locks are physically invulnerable, maybe they can be made legally vulnerable.

02:29.980 --> 02:35.460
To require digital locks be built with a keyhole for which police have the key.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.780
Highly secure, top secret, for emergencies only, surely.

02:39.780 --> 02:44.620
This legal vulnerability, to ban citizens from owning perfect digital locks, to require

02:44.620 --> 02:49.380
companies manufacture their devices with keyholes is an idea that many, many governments are

02:49.380 --> 02:50.380
interested in.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.820
Governments point out that a warrant which lets police into your house and into your

02:53.820 --> 02:56.680
papers should let police into your phone.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.580
If your home is your castle but the need pressing enough, the police bring a battering ram.

03:01.580 --> 03:06.380
But there's no battering ram to crack open a well-locked phone to comply with a warrant.

03:06.380 --> 03:07.760
Not helpfully, anyway.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.300
Which is a problem.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.300
Again, we all ideally want police to crack digital locks sometimes.

03:14.300 --> 03:18.980
But at our current level on the tech tree, digital locks that cannot be opened are a

03:18.980 --> 03:20.380
thing that exists.

03:20.380 --> 03:25.020
And because they are made of math, something a skilled coder can build at home, trying

03:25.020 --> 03:31.180
to ban digital locks for everyone is pretty close to trying to ban an idea.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.860
Good luck with that.

03:32.860 --> 03:38.500
But even were it possible to successfully ban perfect digital locks in a country, remember

03:38.500 --> 03:41.560
on the internet there's no such thing as distance.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.700
Even if your government is a Xanadu bureaucracy of the seraphim incorruptible, there are demons

03:46.700 --> 03:47.700
elsewhere.

03:47.740 --> 03:52.300
Unbreakable digital locks are the foundation upon which computing and internetting is built.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.900
Banking, buying, blogging, vlogging, gaming, tweeting, beating, meeting, all of this is

03:55.900 --> 03:58.460
possible because of unbreakable digital locks.

03:58.460 --> 04:02.380
They've existed since computers filled rooms, but now with computers in our pockets, we

04:02.380 --> 04:05.940
rely on those locks to protect the content of our lives.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.380
The content of our minds.

04:08.380 --> 04:14.080
Forced weakness, even with the best of intentions, places everyone in danger.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.780
The nature of a keyhole is to be cracked, and the nature of the internet is to bring

04:18.780 --> 04:20.440
demons to the door.

04:20.440 --> 04:26.440
No matter how much we might wish it, there's no way to build a digital lock that only angels

04:26.440 --> 04:28.880
can open and demons cannot.

04:28.880 --> 04:34.400
Anyone saying otherwise is either ignorant of the mathematics or less of an angel than

04:34.400 --> 04:34.920
they appear.
