00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Hello internet, we need to talk about locks, the physical and the digital.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,760
In the physical world, locks aren't as good as you think they are.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,480
The lock on your door stops worries, not burglars, as two minutes of searching will reveal.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,420
Spend more, get more, but all fail with tools and time enough.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,860
That physical locks are bad at locking mostly doesn't matter in normal life because burglars

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,140
are constrained by the physical world.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,940
A burglar must cruise the neighborhood, spending their time to pick a target, which makes a

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,460
house that looks secure most of the way toward being secure.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,700
Each target house can then only be attacked one at a time and comes with a risk of being

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
physically caught in the act.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,300
But digital is different.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,240
The constraints of the physical no longer apply.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,100
On the internet, a digital lock must protect you from not just the neighborhood burglar

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,420
but all burglars everywhere, for on the internet, there's no such thing as distance.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,180
Internet burglars don't crack digital locks personally, they build burglar bots that try

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,840
millions of combinations just to see what opens.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,300
One lock down the street or a country full on the other side of the world, it's all the

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
same.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,940
Actually, other side of the world is better.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,960
A dude in East Whateverlandia stealing your identity has a near-zero chance of getting

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
caught.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,560
This is bad news, but thanks to mathematics, digital locks can be made unbreakable.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,020
This is encryption, a digital lock that, without the password, cannot be opened.

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,460
Burglar bots will plow through all the possibilities but a secure password will take longer than

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,780
the heat death of the universe to guess.

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,020
No password, no entry, no matter how much of a lead hacker your mom is.

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,460
Your private files stay private.

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,860
Which might just be the greatest social good mathematics has done mankind.

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,460
But it's easy to imagine unbreakable digital locks as bad news.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,340
Maximum lazy ticking time bomb, the location and off code of which are locked on the phone

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
of a dead man.

32
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,820
Now, were the information on a piece of paper in a safe room, no problem.

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,740
In the physical world, if you can't crack the lock, then you crack the wall.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Society agrees under this scenario it's reasonable for police to get in no matter what it takes.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,860
Note, this means real world locks aren't just physically weak, but also legally weak.

36
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,540
We could live in a world with privacy laws that forbade police to break into all locks

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,980
no matter how flimsy, but we don't, cause that'd be dumb.

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
Hmm.

39
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,340
This is where gears turn in government heads.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,980
If digital locks are physically invulnerable, maybe they can be made legally vulnerable.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,460
To require digital locks be built with a keyhole for which police have the key.

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,780
Highly secure, top secret, for emergencies only, surely.

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,620
This legal vulnerability, to ban citizens from owning perfect digital locks, to require

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,380
companies manufacture their devices with keyholes is an idea that many, many governments are

45
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,380
interested in.

46
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,820
Governments point out that a warrant which lets police into your house and into your

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,680
papers should let police into your phone.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,580
If your home is your castle but the need pressing enough, the police bring a battering ram.

49
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,380
But there's no battering ram to crack open a well-locked phone to comply with a warrant.

50
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,760
Not helpfully, anyway.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,300
Which is a problem.

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Again, we all ideally want police to crack digital locks sometimes.

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,980
But at our current level on the tech tree, digital locks that cannot be opened are a

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,380
thing that exists.

55
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,020
And because they are made of math, something a skilled coder can build at home, trying

56
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,180
to ban digital locks for everyone is pretty close to trying to ban an idea.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,860
Good luck with that.

58
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,500
But even were it possible to successfully ban perfect digital locks in a country, remember

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,560
on the internet there's no such thing as distance.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,700
Even if your government is a Xanadu bureaucracy of the seraphim incorruptible, there are demons

61
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
elsewhere.

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,300
Unbreakable digital locks are the foundation upon which computing and internetting is built.

63
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,900
Banking, buying, blogging, vlogging, gaming, tweeting, beating, meeting, all of this is

64
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,460
possible because of unbreakable digital locks.

65
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,380
They've existed since computers filled rooms, but now with computers in our pockets, we

66
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,940
rely on those locks to protect the content of our lives.

67
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,380
The content of our minds.

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,080
Forced weakness, even with the best of intentions, places everyone in danger.

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,780
The nature of a keyhole is to be cracked, and the nature of the internet is to bring

70
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,440
demons to the door.

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,440
No matter how much we might wish it, there's no way to build a digital lock that only angels

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,880
can open and demons cannot.

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Anyone saying otherwise is either ignorant of the mathematics or less of an angel than

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,920
they appear.
