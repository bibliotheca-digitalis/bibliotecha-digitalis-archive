0	4380	Hello internet, we need to talk about locks, the physical and the digital.
4380	7760	In the physical world, locks aren't as good as you think they are.
7760	13480	The lock on your door stops worries, not burglars, as two minutes of searching will reveal.
13480	17420	Spend more, get more, but all fail with tools and time enough.
17420	21860	That physical locks are bad at locking mostly doesn't matter in normal life because burglars
21860	24140	are constrained by the physical world.
24140	27940	A burglar must cruise the neighborhood, spending their time to pick a target, which makes a
27940	31460	house that looks secure most of the way toward being secure.
31460	35700	Each target house can then only be attacked one at a time and comes with a risk of being
35700	37700	physically caught in the act.
37700	39300	But digital is different.
39300	42240	The constraints of the physical no longer apply.
42240	46100	On the internet, a digital lock must protect you from not just the neighborhood burglar
46100	52420	but all burglars everywhere, for on the internet, there's no such thing as distance.
52420	56180	Internet burglars don't crack digital locks personally, they build burglar bots that try
56180	59840	millions of combinations just to see what opens.
59840	64300	One lock down the street or a country full on the other side of the world, it's all the
64300	65300	same.
65300	66940	Actually, other side of the world is better.
66940	71960	A dude in East Whateverlandia stealing your identity has a near-zero chance of getting
71960	72960	caught.
72960	77560	This is bad news, but thanks to mathematics, digital locks can be made unbreakable.
77560	83020	This is encryption, a digital lock that, without the password, cannot be opened.
83020	87460	Burglar bots will plow through all the possibilities but a secure password will take longer than
87460	89780	the heat death of the universe to guess.
89780	94020	No password, no entry, no matter how much of a lead hacker your mom is.
94020	96460	Your private files stay private.
96460	100860	Which might just be the greatest social good mathematics has done mankind.
100860	105460	But it's easy to imagine unbreakable digital locks as bad news.
105460	110340	Maximum lazy ticking time bomb, the location and off code of which are locked on the phone
110340	111340	of a dead man.
111340	115820	Now, were the information on a piece of paper in a safe room, no problem.
115820	119740	In the physical world, if you can't crack the lock, then you crack the wall.
119740	125740	Society agrees under this scenario it's reasonable for police to get in no matter what it takes.
125740	131860	Note, this means real world locks aren't just physically weak, but also legally weak.
131860	136540	We could live in a world with privacy laws that forbade police to break into all locks
136540	139980	no matter how flimsy, but we don't, cause that'd be dumb.
139980	140980	Hmm.
141620	144340	This is where gears turn in government heads.
144340	149980	If digital locks are physically invulnerable, maybe they can be made legally vulnerable.
149980	155460	To require digital locks be built with a keyhole for which police have the key.
155460	159780	Highly secure, top secret, for emergencies only, surely.
159780	164620	This legal vulnerability, to ban citizens from owning perfect digital locks, to require
164620	169380	companies manufacture their devices with keyholes is an idea that many, many governments are
169380	170380	interested in.
170420	173820	Governments point out that a warrant which lets police into your house and into your
173820	176680	papers should let police into your phone.
176680	181580	If your home is your castle but the need pressing enough, the police bring a battering ram.
181580	186380	But there's no battering ram to crack open a well-locked phone to comply with a warrant.
186380	187760	Not helpfully, anyway.
187760	189300	Which is a problem.
189300	194300	Again, we all ideally want police to crack digital locks sometimes.
194300	198980	But at our current level on the tech tree, digital locks that cannot be opened are a
198980	200380	thing that exists.
200380	205020	And because they are made of math, something a skilled coder can build at home, trying
205020	211180	to ban digital locks for everyone is pretty close to trying to ban an idea.
211180	212860	Good luck with that.
212860	218500	But even were it possible to successfully ban perfect digital locks in a country, remember
218500	221560	on the internet there's no such thing as distance.
221560	226700	Even if your government is a Xanadu bureaucracy of the seraphim incorruptible, there are demons
226700	227700	elsewhere.
227740	232300	Unbreakable digital locks are the foundation upon which computing and internetting is built.
232300	235900	Banking, buying, blogging, vlogging, gaming, tweeting, beating, meeting, all of this is
235900	238460	possible because of unbreakable digital locks.
238460	242380	They've existed since computers filled rooms, but now with computers in our pockets, we
242380	245940	rely on those locks to protect the content of our lives.
245940	248380	The content of our minds.
248380	254080	Forced weakness, even with the best of intentions, places everyone in danger.
254080	258780	The nature of a keyhole is to be cracked, and the nature of the internet is to bring
258780	260440	demons to the door.
260440	266440	No matter how much we might wish it, there's no way to build a digital lock that only angels
266440	268880	can open and demons cannot.
268880	274400	Anyone saying otherwise is either ignorant of the mathematics or less of an angel than
274400	274920	they appear.
