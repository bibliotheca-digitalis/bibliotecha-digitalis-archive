Hello internet. If you didn't already know, I'm a big fan of the yearly theme.

00:04.140 --> 00:09.520
A broad rainbow above your goals to help direct you on part of your journey through this life.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.540
And yes, I know exactly how that sounds.

00:12.540 --> 00:16.800
But, if you're intrigued and or wondering why Grey would recommend such a thing

00:16.800 --> 00:20.300
and looking for a way to give it a try, well, I've got something for you.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.860
The Theme System Journal. Ooh, lovely.

00:23.860 --> 00:27.300
The Theme System Journal is a beautifully designed notebook.

00:27.300 --> 00:32.840
Inside is a welcome page with guidance on how to pick a theme for the theme page that follows.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.940
Pages, actually.

00:33.940 --> 00:38.200
Sometimes your theme will need to change, so no pressure to get it perfect the first time.

00:38.200 --> 00:44.100
Then pages for qualitative daily journaling and a section for quantitative tracking of progress.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.380
You may notice this is pretty open-ended.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.500
There aren't explicit, you must do this here labels on the boxes

00:50.500 --> 00:56.520
and it's because it's important to me that the design of the journal not force my exact process on you.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.080
But, if you want to know what I generally do when I'm journaling,

00:59.080 --> 01:01.600
I use the top line for where I am at the time.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.320
What am I personally and professionally grateful for?

01:04.320 --> 01:07.960
Yes, I know how that sounds and past me would have rolled his eyes so hard at that,

01:07.960 --> 01:09.880
but it's frustratingly effective.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.560
Maybe a story for another time.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.320
Anyway, the big box is the place to get out what is on my mind when I wake up in the morning.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.840
And the bottom box is for the one most important thing to get done today,

01:19.840 --> 01:23.480
such that if only this gets done, it still counts as a good day.

01:23.480 --> 01:27.800
That's what I do, and if you're looking for a place to start, that's what I would recommend,

01:27.800 --> 01:33.880
and then shape the theme system journal to be what works best for you and your theme over the season.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.880
If you've listened to the theme discussions on the Cortex Podcast, where the little logo comes from,

01:37.880 --> 01:41.560
you will already know this journal has been 18 months in the making.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.320
18 months of perfect paper picking, debossing, debugging, pen penetration prevention,

01:46.320 --> 01:49.440
cover considerations, and beta batches canvassing critiques.

01:49.440 --> 01:54.840
And all of that is fully finished, the final forms finally for sale.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.840
If you want to give themes a try as a way to guide your goals and decisions,

01:58.840 --> 02:02.520
there is no better, more lovingly made notebook to use.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.600
