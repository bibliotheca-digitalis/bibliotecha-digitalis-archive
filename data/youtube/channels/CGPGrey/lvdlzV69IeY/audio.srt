Hello internet. If you didn't already know, I'm a big fan of the yearly theme.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,520
A broad rainbow above your goals to help direct you on part of your journey through this life.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,540
And yes, I know exactly how that sounds.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,800
But, if you're intrigued and or wondering why Grey would recommend such a thing

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,300
and looking for a way to give it a try, well, I've got something for you.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,860
The Theme System Journal. Ooh, lovely.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,300
The Theme System Journal is a beautifully designed notebook.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,840
Inside is a welcome page with guidance on how to pick a theme for the theme page that follows.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,940
Pages, actually.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,200
Sometimes your theme will need to change, so no pressure to get it perfect the first time.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,100
Then pages for qualitative daily journaling and a section for quantitative tracking of progress.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,380
You may notice this is pretty open-ended.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,500
There aren't explicit, you must do this here labels on the boxes

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,520
and it's because it's important to me that the design of the journal not force my exact process on you.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,080
But, if you want to know what I generally do when I'm journaling,

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,600
I use the top line for where I am at the time.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,320
What am I personally and professionally grateful for?

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,960
Yes, I know how that sounds and past me would have rolled his eyes so hard at that,

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,880
but it's frustratingly effective.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,560
Maybe a story for another time.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,320
Anyway, the big box is the place to get out what is on my mind when I wake up in the morning.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,840
And the bottom box is for the one most important thing to get done today,

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,480
such that if only this gets done, it still counts as a good day.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,800
That's what I do, and if you're looking for a place to start, that's what I would recommend,

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,880
and then shape the theme system journal to be what works best for you and your theme over the season.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,880
If you've listened to the theme discussions on the Cortex Podcast, where the little logo comes from,

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,560
you will already know this journal has been 18 months in the making.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,320
18 months of perfect paper picking, debossing, debugging, pen penetration prevention,

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,440
cover considerations, and beta batches canvassing critiques.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,840
And all of that is fully finished, the final forms finally for sale.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,840
If you want to give themes a try as a way to guide your goals and decisions,

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,520
there is no better, more lovingly made notebook to use.
