0	4140	Hello internet. If you didn't already know, I'm a big fan of the yearly theme.
4140	9520	A broad rainbow above your goals to help direct you on part of your journey through this life.
9520	12540	And yes, I know exactly how that sounds.
12540	16800	But, if you're intrigued and or wondering why Grey would recommend such a thing
16800	20300	and looking for a way to give it a try, well, I've got something for you.
20300	23860	The Theme System Journal. Ooh, lovely.
23860	27300	The Theme System Journal is a beautifully designed notebook.
27300	32840	Inside is a welcome page with guidance on how to pick a theme for the theme page that follows.
32840	33940	Pages, actually.
33940	38200	Sometimes your theme will need to change, so no pressure to get it perfect the first time.
38200	44100	Then pages for qualitative daily journaling and a section for quantitative tracking of progress.
44100	46380	You may notice this is pretty open-ended.
46380	50500	There aren't explicit, you must do this here labels on the boxes
50500	56520	and it's because it's important to me that the design of the journal not force my exact process on you.
56520	59080	But, if you want to know what I generally do when I'm journaling,
59080	61600	I use the top line for where I am at the time.
61600	64320	What am I personally and professionally grateful for?
64320	67960	Yes, I know how that sounds and past me would have rolled his eyes so hard at that,
67960	69880	but it's frustratingly effective.
69880	71560	Maybe a story for another time.
71560	76320	Anyway, the big box is the place to get out what is on my mind when I wake up in the morning.
76320	79840	And the bottom box is for the one most important thing to get done today,
79840	83480	such that if only this gets done, it still counts as a good day.
83480	87800	That's what I do, and if you're looking for a place to start, that's what I would recommend,
87800	93880	and then shape the theme system journal to be what works best for you and your theme over the season.
93880	97880	If you've listened to the theme discussions on the Cortex Podcast, where the little logo comes from,
97880	101560	you will already know this journal has been 18 months in the making.
101560	106320	18 months of perfect paper picking, debossing, debugging, pen penetration prevention,
106320	109440	cover considerations, and beta batches canvassing critiques.
109440	114840	And all of that is fully finished, the final forms finally for sale.
114840	118840	If you want to give themes a try as a way to guide your goals and decisions,
118840	122520	there is no better, more lovingly made notebook to use.
