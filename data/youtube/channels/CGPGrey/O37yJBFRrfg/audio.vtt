00:00.000 --> 00:01.680
Where is the European Union?

00:01.680 --> 00:06.360
Obviously, here somewhere, but much like the European continent itself, which has an unclear boundary,

00:06.360 --> 00:09.120
the European Union also has some fuzzy edges to it.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.880
To start, the official members of the European Union are, in decreasing order of population,

00:12.880 --> 00:17.120
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of the Netherlands,

00:17.120 --> 00:21.520
Greece, Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Slovakia,

00:21.520 --> 00:25.920
Finland, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.960
The edges of the EU will probably continue to expand further out,

00:28.960 --> 00:32.320
as there are other countries in various stages of trying to become a member.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.240
How the EU works is hideously complicated and a story for another time,

00:36.240 --> 00:39.200
but for this video, you need know only three things.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.200
First, countries pay membership dues, and second, vote on the laws they all must follow,

00:43.200 --> 00:48.000
and third, citizens of member countries are automatically European Union citizens as well.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.720
This last means that if you're a citizen of any of these countries,

00:50.720 --> 00:54.480
you are free to live and work and retire in any of the others, which is nice,

00:54.480 --> 00:58.400
especially if you think your country is too big or too small or too hot or too cold.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.400
The European Union gives you options.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.400
By the way, did you notice how all three of these statements

01:02.400 --> 01:04.880
have asterisks attached to this unhelpful footnote?

01:04.880 --> 01:06.000
Well, get used to it.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.760
Europe loves asterisks that add exceptions to complicated agreements.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.880
These three, for example, point us towards the first bit of border fuzziness

01:12.880 --> 01:16.800
with Norway, Iceland and Little Liechtenstein, none of which are in the European Union,

01:16.800 --> 01:19.600
but if you're an EU citizen, you can live in these countries,

01:19.600 --> 01:22.880
and Norwegians, Icelanders or Liechtensteiners can live in yours.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.360
Why?

01:23.360 --> 01:25.200
In exchange for freedom of movement of people,

01:25.200 --> 01:27.760
they have to pay membership fees to the European Union,

01:27.760 --> 01:30.720
even though they aren't a part of it and thus don't get a say in its laws

01:30.720 --> 01:32.160
that they still have to follow.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.560
This arrangement is the European Economic Area,

01:34.560 --> 01:37.440
and it sounds like a terrible deal were it not for that asterisk

01:37.440 --> 01:41.440
which grants EEA but not EU members a pass on some areas of law,

01:41.440 --> 01:43.040
notably farming and fishing.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.120
Something a country like, say, Iceland might care quite a lot about running themselves.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.520
Between the European Union and the European Economic Area,

01:49.520 --> 01:52.720
the continent looks mostly covered with the notable exception of Switzerland,

01:52.720 --> 01:55.120
who remains neutral and fiercely independent,

01:55.120 --> 01:57.440
except for her participation in the Schengen Area.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.960
If you're from a country that keeps her borders extremely clean and or well patrolled,

02:00.960 --> 02:02.960
the Schengen Area is a bit mind-blowing

02:02.960 --> 02:06.560
because it's an agreement between countries to take a meh approach to borders.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.280
In the Schengen Area, international boundaries look like this.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.000
No border officers or passport checks of any kind.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.880
You can walk from Lisbon to Tallinn without identification

02:14.880 --> 02:17.520
or the need to answer the question, business or pleasure.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.960
For Switzerland, being part of Schengen but not part of the European Union

02:20.960 --> 02:23.760
means that non-Swiss can check in any time they like,

02:23.760 --> 02:25.360
but they can never stay.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.360
This Kumbaya approach to borders isn't appreciated by everyone in the EU.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.280
Most loudly, the United Kingdom and Ireland, who argue that islands are different.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.200
Thus, to get onto these fair isles, you'll need a passport and a good reason.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.600
Britannia's reluctance to get fully involved with the EU brings us to the next topic, money.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.240
The European Union has its own fancy currency, the euro,

02:44.240 --> 02:47.360
used by the majority but not all of the European Union members.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.440
This economic union is called the Eurozone

02:49.440 --> 02:52.400
and to join a country must first reach certain financial goals.

02:52.400 --> 02:57.120
And lying about reaching those goals is certainly not something anyone would do.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.360
Most of the non-Eurozone members, when they meet the goals,

02:59.360 --> 03:01.680
will ditch their local currency in favor of the euro.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.640
But three of them, Denmark, Sweden and of course, the United Kingdom,

03:04.640 --> 03:08.640
have asterisks attached to the euro section of the treaty, giving them a permanent opt-out.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.040
And weirdly, four tiny European countries, Andorra, San Marino, Monaco and Vatican City,

03:13.040 --> 03:15.520
have an asterisk giving them the exact reverse.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.000
The right to print and use euros as their money,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.200
despite not being in the European Union at all.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.320
So that's the big picture.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.160
There's the EU, which makes all the rules, the Eurozone inside of it with a common currency,

03:26.160 --> 03:29.440
the European economic area outside of it where people can move freely,

03:29.440 --> 03:33.280
and the selective Schengen for countries that think borders just aren't worth the hassle.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.520
As you can see, there's some strange overlap with these borders,

03:35.520 --> 03:38.480
but we're not done talking about complications by a long shot.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.400
Once again, because empire.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.680
So Portugal and Spain have islands from their colonial days that they've never parted with.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.240
These are the Madeira and Canary Islands off the coast of Africa

03:46.240 --> 03:48.080
and the Azores well into the Atlantic.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.160
Because these islands are Spanish and Portuguese,

03:50.160 --> 03:52.400
they're part of the European Union as well.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.960
Adding a few islands to the EU's borders isn't a big deal

03:54.960 --> 03:58.320
until you consider France, the queen of not letting go.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.560
She still holds on to a bunch of islands in the Caribbean,

04:00.560 --> 04:04.080
Reunion off the coast of Madagascar and French Guiana in South America.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.720
As far as France is concerned, these are France too,

04:06.720 --> 04:10.800
which single-handedly extends the edge-to-edge distance of the European Union

04:10.800 --> 04:13.280
across a third of the Earth's circumference.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.360
Collectively, these bits of France, Spain and Portugal are called the outermost regions

04:17.360 --> 04:19.920
and they're the result of the simple answer to empire.

04:19.920 --> 04:20.640
Just keep it.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.480
On the other hand, there's the United Kingdom,

04:22.480 --> 04:26.560
the master of maintaining complicated relationships with her quasi-former lands.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.840
And she's by no means alone in this on such an empire-happy continent.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.000
The Netherlands and Denmark and France, again,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.120
all have what the European Union calls overseas territories.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.960
They're not part of the European Union,

04:36.960 --> 04:39.760
instead they're a bottomless well of asterisks

04:39.760 --> 04:44.240
due to their complicated relationships with both the European Union and their associated countries.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.760
Which makes it hard to say anything meaningful about them as a group,

04:47.760 --> 04:51.280
but in general European Union law doesn't apply to these places,

04:51.280 --> 04:54.800
though in general the people who live there are European Union citizens

04:54.800 --> 04:58.160
because in general they have the citizenship of their associated country,

04:58.160 --> 05:01.040
so in general they can live anywhere in the EU they want,

05:01.040 --> 05:05.760
but in general other European Union citizens can't freely move to these territories.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.920
Which makes these places a weird semi-permeable membrane of the European Union proper

05:09.920 --> 05:12.720
and the final part we're going to talk about in detail,

05:12.720 --> 05:16.080
even though there are still many more one-off asterisks you might stumble upon,

05:16.080 --> 05:18.800
such as the Isle of Man or those Spanish cities in North Africa,

05:18.800 --> 05:21.680
or Gibraltar who pretends to be part of southwest England sometimes,

05:21.680 --> 05:24.240
or that region in Greece where it's totally legal to ban women,

05:24.240 --> 05:28.560
or Saba and Friends who are part of the Netherlands and so should be part of the EU but aren't,

05:28.560 --> 05:31.200
or the Faroe Islands upon which while citizens of Denmark live,

05:31.200 --> 05:34.560
they lose their EU citizenship and on and on it goes.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.680
These asterisks almost never end, but this video must.

05:42.720 --> 05:50.320
Thank you.
