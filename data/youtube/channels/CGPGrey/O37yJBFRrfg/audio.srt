1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Where is the European Union?

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,360
Obviously, here somewhere, but much like the European continent itself, which has an unclear boundary,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,120
the European Union also has some fuzzy edges to it.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,880
To start, the official members of the European Union are, in decreasing order of population,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of the Netherlands,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,520
Greece, Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Slovakia,

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,920
Finland, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
The edges of the EU will probably continue to expand further out,

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
as there are other countries in various stages of trying to become a member.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,240
How the EU works is hideously complicated and a story for another time,

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,200
but for this video, you need know only three things.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
First, countries pay membership dues, and second, vote on the laws they all must follow,

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
and third, citizens of member countries are automatically European Union citizens as well.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,720
This last means that if you're a citizen of any of these countries,

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,480
you are free to live and work and retire in any of the others, which is nice,

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,400
especially if you think your country is too big or too small or too hot or too cold.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
The European Union gives you options.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
By the way, did you notice how all three of these statements

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,880
have asterisks attached to this unhelpful footnote?

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, get used to it.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
Europe loves asterisks that add exceptions to complicated agreements.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
These three, for example, point us towards the first bit of border fuzziness

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,800
with Norway, Iceland and Little Liechtenstein, none of which are in the European Union,

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
but if you're an EU citizen, you can live in these countries,

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
and Norwegians, Icelanders or Liechtensteiners can live in yours.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,360
Why?

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
In exchange for freedom of movement of people,

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,760
they have to pay membership fees to the European Union,

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,720
even though they aren't a part of it and thus don't get a say in its laws

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,160
that they still have to follow.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
This arrangement is the European Economic Area,

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,440
and it sounds like a terrible deal were it not for that asterisk

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,440
which grants EEA but not EU members a pass on some areas of law,

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,040
notably farming and fishing.

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,120
Something a country like, say, Iceland might care quite a lot about running themselves.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
Between the European Union and the European Economic Area,

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
the continent looks mostly covered with the notable exception of Switzerland,

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,120
who remains neutral and fiercely independent,

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,440
except for her participation in the Schengen Area.

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,960
If you're from a country that keeps her borders extremely clean and or well patrolled,

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
the Schengen Area is a bit mind-blowing

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
because it's an agreement between countries to take a meh approach to borders.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
In the Schengen Area, international boundaries look like this.

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,000
No border officers or passport checks of any kind.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,880
You can walk from Lisbon to Tallinn without identification

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,520
or the need to answer the question, business or pleasure.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,960
For Switzerland, being part of Schengen but not part of the European Union

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,760
means that non-Swiss can check in any time they like,

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
but they can never stay.

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
This Kumbaya approach to borders isn't appreciated by everyone in the EU.

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
Most loudly, the United Kingdom and Ireland, who argue that islands are different.

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,200
Thus, to get onto these fair isles, you'll need a passport and a good reason.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,600
Britannia's reluctance to get fully involved with the EU brings us to the next topic, money.

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,240
The European Union has its own fancy currency, the euro,

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,360
used by the majority but not all of the European Union members.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
This economic union is called the Eurozone

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
and to join a country must first reach certain financial goals.

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,120
And lying about reaching those goals is certainly not something anyone would do.

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
Most of the non-Eurozone members, when they meet the goals,

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
will ditch their local currency in favor of the euro.

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
But three of them, Denmark, Sweden and of course, the United Kingdom,

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
have asterisks attached to the euro section of the treaty, giving them a permanent opt-out.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,040
And weirdly, four tiny European countries, Andorra, San Marino, Monaco and Vatican City,

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,520
have an asterisk giving them the exact reverse.

65
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,000
The right to print and use euros as their money,

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
despite not being in the European Union at all.

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
So that's the big picture.

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,160
There's the EU, which makes all the rules, the Eurozone inside of it with a common currency,

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,440
the European economic area outside of it where people can move freely,

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
and the selective Schengen for countries that think borders just aren't worth the hassle.

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,520
As you can see, there's some strange overlap with these borders,

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,480
but we're not done talking about complications by a long shot.

73
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
Once again, because empire.

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
So Portugal and Spain have islands from their colonial days that they've never parted with.

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,240
These are the Madeira and Canary Islands off the coast of Africa

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,080
and the Azores well into the Atlantic.

77
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,160
Because these islands are Spanish and Portuguese,

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
they're part of the European Union as well.

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,960
Adding a few islands to the EU's borders isn't a big deal

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,320
until you consider France, the queen of not letting go.

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,560
She still holds on to a bunch of islands in the Caribbean,

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,080
Reunion off the coast of Madagascar and French Guiana in South America.

83
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
As far as France is concerned, these are France too,

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,800
which single-handedly extends the edge-to-edge distance of the European Union

85
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,280
across a third of the Earth's circumference.

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,360
Collectively, these bits of France, Spain and Portugal are called the outermost regions

87
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
and they're the result of the simple answer to empire.

88
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,640
Just keep it.

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,480
On the other hand, there's the United Kingdom,

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,560
the master of maintaining complicated relationships with her quasi-former lands.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,840
And she's by no means alone in this on such an empire-happy continent.

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
The Netherlands and Denmark and France, again,

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
all have what the European Union calls overseas territories.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
They're not part of the European Union,

95
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,760
instead they're a bottomless well of asterisks

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,240
due to their complicated relationships with both the European Union and their associated countries.

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,760
Which makes it hard to say anything meaningful about them as a group,

98
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,280
but in general European Union law doesn't apply to these places,

99
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,800
though in general the people who live there are European Union citizens

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
because in general they have the citizenship of their associated country,

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,040
so in general they can live anywhere in the EU they want,

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,760
but in general other European Union citizens can't freely move to these territories.

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,920
Which makes these places a weird semi-permeable membrane of the European Union proper

104
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
and the final part we're going to talk about in detail,

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
even though there are still many more one-off asterisks you might stumble upon,

106
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
such as the Isle of Man or those Spanish cities in North Africa,

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,680
or Gibraltar who pretends to be part of southwest England sometimes,

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
or that region in Greece where it's totally legal to ban women,

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,560
or Saba and Friends who are part of the Netherlands and so should be part of the EU but aren't,

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,200
or the Faroe Islands upon which while citizens of Denmark live,

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
they lose their EU citizenship and on and on it goes.

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
These asterisks almost never end, but this video must.

113
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,320
Thank you.
