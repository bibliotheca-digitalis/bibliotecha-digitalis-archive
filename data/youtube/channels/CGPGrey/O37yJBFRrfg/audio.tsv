0	1680	Where is the European Union?
1680	6360	Obviously, here somewhere, but much like the European continent itself, which has an unclear boundary,
6360	9120	the European Union also has some fuzzy edges to it.
9120	12880	To start, the official members of the European Union are, in decreasing order of population,
12880	17120	Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of the Netherlands,
17120	21520	Greece, Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Slovakia,
21520	25920	Finland, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta.
25920	28960	The edges of the EU will probably continue to expand further out,
28960	32320	as there are other countries in various stages of trying to become a member.
32320	36240	How the EU works is hideously complicated and a story for another time,
36240	39200	but for this video, you need know only three things.
39200	43200	First, countries pay membership dues, and second, vote on the laws they all must follow,
43200	48000	and third, citizens of member countries are automatically European Union citizens as well.
48000	50720	This last means that if you're a citizen of any of these countries,
50720	54480	you are free to live and work and retire in any of the others, which is nice,
54480	58400	especially if you think your country is too big or too small or too hot or too cold.
58400	60400	The European Union gives you options.
60400	62400	By the way, did you notice how all three of these statements
62400	64880	have asterisks attached to this unhelpful footnote?
64880	66000	Well, get used to it.
66000	69760	Europe loves asterisks that add exceptions to complicated agreements.
69760	72880	These three, for example, point us towards the first bit of border fuzziness
72880	76800	with Norway, Iceland and Little Liechtenstein, none of which are in the European Union,
76800	79600	but if you're an EU citizen, you can live in these countries,
79600	82880	and Norwegians, Icelanders or Liechtensteiners can live in yours.
82880	83360	Why?
83360	85200	In exchange for freedom of movement of people,
85200	87760	they have to pay membership fees to the European Union,
87760	90720	even though they aren't a part of it and thus don't get a say in its laws
90720	92160	that they still have to follow.
92160	94560	This arrangement is the European Economic Area,
94560	97440	and it sounds like a terrible deal were it not for that asterisk
97440	101440	which grants EEA but not EU members a pass on some areas of law,
101440	103040	notably farming and fishing.
103040	107120	Something a country like, say, Iceland might care quite a lot about running themselves.
107120	109520	Between the European Union and the European Economic Area,
109520	112720	the continent looks mostly covered with the notable exception of Switzerland,
112720	115120	who remains neutral and fiercely independent,
115120	117440	except for her participation in the Schengen Area.
117440	120960	If you're from a country that keeps her borders extremely clean and or well patrolled,
120960	122960	the Schengen Area is a bit mind-blowing
122960	126560	because it's an agreement between countries to take a meh approach to borders.
126560	129280	In the Schengen Area, international boundaries look like this.
129280	132000	No border officers or passport checks of any kind.
132000	134880	You can walk from Lisbon to Tallinn without identification
134880	137520	or the need to answer the question, business or pleasure.
137520	140960	For Switzerland, being part of Schengen but not part of the European Union
140960	143760	means that non-Swiss can check in any time they like,
143760	145360	but they can never stay.
145360	149360	This Kumbaya approach to borders isn't appreciated by everyone in the EU.
149360	153280	Most loudly, the United Kingdom and Ireland, who argue that islands are different.
153280	157200	Thus, to get onto these fair isles, you'll need a passport and a good reason.
157200	161600	Britannia's reluctance to get fully involved with the EU brings us to the next topic, money.
161600	164240	The European Union has its own fancy currency, the euro,
164240	167360	used by the majority but not all of the European Union members.
167360	169440	This economic union is called the Eurozone
169440	172400	and to join a country must first reach certain financial goals.
172400	177120	And lying about reaching those goals is certainly not something anyone would do.
177120	179360	Most of the non-Eurozone members, when they meet the goals,
179360	181680	will ditch their local currency in favor of the euro.
181680	184640	But three of them, Denmark, Sweden and of course, the United Kingdom,
184640	188640	have asterisks attached to the euro section of the treaty, giving them a permanent opt-out.
188640	193040	And weirdly, four tiny European countries, Andorra, San Marino, Monaco and Vatican City,
193040	195520	have an asterisk giving them the exact reverse.
195520	198000	The right to print and use euros as their money,
198000	201200	despite not being in the European Union at all.
201200	202320	So that's the big picture.
202320	206160	There's the EU, which makes all the rules, the Eurozone inside of it with a common currency,
206160	209440	the European economic area outside of it where people can move freely,
209440	213280	and the selective Schengen for countries that think borders just aren't worth the hassle.
213280	215520	As you can see, there's some strange overlap with these borders,
215520	218480	but we're not done talking about complications by a long shot.
218480	220400	Once again, because empire.
220400	223680	So Portugal and Spain have islands from their colonial days that they've never parted with.
223680	226240	These are the Madeira and Canary Islands off the coast of Africa
226240	228080	and the Azores well into the Atlantic.
228080	230160	Because these islands are Spanish and Portuguese,
230160	232400	they're part of the European Union as well.
232400	234960	Adding a few islands to the EU's borders isn't a big deal
234960	238320	until you consider France, the queen of not letting go.
238320	240560	She still holds on to a bunch of islands in the Caribbean,
240560	244080	Reunion off the coast of Madagascar and French Guiana in South America.
244080	246720	As far as France is concerned, these are France too,
246720	250800	which single-handedly extends the edge-to-edge distance of the European Union
250800	253280	across a third of the Earth's circumference.
253280	257360	Collectively, these bits of France, Spain and Portugal are called the outermost regions
257360	259920	and they're the result of the simple answer to empire.
259920	260640	Just keep it.
260640	262480	On the other hand, there's the United Kingdom,
262480	266560	the master of maintaining complicated relationships with her quasi-former lands.
266560	269840	And she's by no means alone in this on such an empire-happy continent.
269840	272000	The Netherlands and Denmark and France, again,
272000	275120	all have what the European Union calls overseas territories.
275120	276960	They're not part of the European Union,
276960	279760	instead they're a bottomless well of asterisks
279760	284240	due to their complicated relationships with both the European Union and their associated countries.
284240	287760	Which makes it hard to say anything meaningful about them as a group,
287760	291280	but in general European Union law doesn't apply to these places,
291280	294800	though in general the people who live there are European Union citizens
294800	298160	because in general they have the citizenship of their associated country,
298160	301040	so in general they can live anywhere in the EU they want,
301040	305760	but in general other European Union citizens can't freely move to these territories.
305760	309920	Which makes these places a weird semi-permeable membrane of the European Union proper
309920	312720	and the final part we're going to talk about in detail,
312720	316080	even though there are still many more one-off asterisks you might stumble upon,
316080	318800	such as the Isle of Man or those Spanish cities in North Africa,
318800	321680	or Gibraltar who pretends to be part of southwest England sometimes,
321680	324240	or that region in Greece where it's totally legal to ban women,
324240	328560	or Saba and Friends who are part of the Netherlands and so should be part of the EU but aren't,
328560	331200	or the Faroe Islands upon which while citizens of Denmark live,
331200	334560	they lose their EU citizenship and on and on it goes.
334560	337680	These asterisks almost never end, but this video must.
342720	350320	Thank you.
