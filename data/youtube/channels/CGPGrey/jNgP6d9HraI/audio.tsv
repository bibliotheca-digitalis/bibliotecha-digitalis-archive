0	3760	1066. The start of the royal family on these fair isles.
3760	8800	Well, there were kings in many countries before that, and druids before that, and Pangaea before that,
8800	11720	but we have to start somewhere, and a millennia ago is plenty far.
11720	14440	If that leaves out Ã†thelred the Unready, so it goes.
14440	17240	William the Conqueror conquered in the Norman Conquest,
17240	19200	Norman here being code for French.
19200	22600	Because it's the olden days, people had lots of kids, but to keep things simple,
22600	28240	this family tree is going to leave out many of them on each branch, because not every child matters.
28240	32240	So William had three kids we care about, William II, Henry I, and Adela.
32240	35080	If you've seen the video about royal succession, click here if you haven't,
35080	38320	you'll know that formal rules for passing on the crown will get established,
38320	41880	but for now, it's a free-for-all home team advantage to the eldest son.
41880	44200	But never forget, bigger army diplomacy.
44200	46760	Upon William the Conqueror's death, William II became king.
46760	49520	William II didn't marry, and on a bro's day out with Henry,
49520	52440	died in a hunting accident that gave Henry I the crown.
52440	56440	Henry I had at least 26 children, of which only two were 100% legit.
56440	59200	He declared his daughter would rule next, after his son died in a shipwreck,
59200	62320	and swore his knights to honor Empress Matilda by crossing their hearts, hoping to die,
62320	63800	sticking a needle in their eye.
63800	66360	But, when Henry I died while Matilda was in France,
66360	69240	many ignored this while her cousin, Stephen, raced to Westminster,
69240	72120	using faster army diplomacy to get coronated first.
72120	75440	Empress Matilda did eventually return, and start a decades-long civil war
75440	79560	that was pretty much a stalemate, because turtling in the 1100s was an effective RTS tactic.
79560	83040	While she did rule part of the island, as Matilda never had an official coronation,
83040	84680	her monarchal status is disputed.
84720	87800	Now, as Stephen's children were either dead, disinterested, or a nun,
87800	91480	his crown went to his nephew, Henry II, who had four sons,
91480	94640	Henry the Young, Richard the Lionheart, King John, and... Jeff.
94640	96000	Guess who died before his turn?
96000	99520	Henry II saw the history thus far of conquering, assassination, maybe,
99520	103920	usurpation, attritional war, and decided, waiting until after the death of the current king,
103920	106400	before sorting out the next king, didn't work.
106400	109120	So Henry II changed the system, and crowned Henry the Young,
109120	111600	co-king with him, invoking the rule of two.
111600	112760	One is none.
112760	113600	Two is one.
113600	115240	Important, you need a backup.
115240	118760	It was a good plan for stability, helped by the young king's popularity,
118760	121520	but unfortunately, the apprentice rebelled against the master,
121520	124880	rallying his brothers, which resulted in another civil war of disputed monarchs,
124880	128040	during which Henry the Young died of dysentery, Henry the Elder died of fever,
128040	129520	and Richard I took the crown.
129520	132760	After Richard came John, and four eldest sons' successions in a row.
132760	135640	John to Henry III, insert Magna Carta here, to Edward I,
135640	137640	Longshanks to Edward II, to Edward III.
137640	140240	Actually, Ed II was overthrown by Isabelle of France,
140240	143400	AKA the She-Wolf of France, AKA his wife.
143400	146760	After deposing her husband, she acted as regent for their son.
146760	150080	Every one of these arrows glosses over a bit of complexity.
150080	152600	Edward III had five sons, Edward the Black Prince,
152600	156240	Lionel, John, Edmund, and Thomas, none of which would wear the crown.
156240	159320	When Edward III died, his throne would have gone to the Black Prince,
159320	162720	but he was dead at the time, so the crown went to his boringly named son Richard,
162720	163640	now the Second.
163640	165960	There's a bunch of drama-lama stuff around Richard II,
165960	167720	which your English teacher might force you to read about,
167720	170640	but spoiler alert, history's ending is always the same.
170640	172040	Bigger army diplomacy.
172040	174520	This time from Henry IV, who gets the crown,
174520	176960	and Richard II gets starvation in captivity.
176960	179560	Another Henry before we get to the War of the Roses,
179560	181480	a war that strikes terror and boredom
181480	183560	in the minds of students of history the nation over,
183560	186840	who have to deal with this family tree, simplified,
186840	188880	to explain why everyone was angry.
188880	193040	But the shortest version ever is Edward III's great-great-grandsons duked it out,
193040	195240	even though one of them was dead for part of the fight,
195240	196200	but we can't get into that now,
196200	199200	so Henry VI to Edward IV, to Henry VI to Edward IV, the end.
199200	201760	Edward IV, on his deathbed, left his crown to his son,
201760	203600	but being 12, he needed protection,
203600	205840	so Richard, his bestest uncle in the world,
205840	207600	promised to take super good care of him.
207600	210840	Edward V then promptly disappeared under suspicious circumstances
210840	213040	that left Richard to become Richard III.
213040	214280	But he didn't stay king for long,
214280	218040	because Edward III's great-great-great-great-grandson Henry VII
218040	220160	took the crown, put a ring on Elizabeth of York
220160	222040	to lock down that royal legitimacy,
222040	225440	and then sired Henry VIII, splitter of churches and ladies.
225440	227480	Henry VIII thought it was high time
227480	229360	to formalize the rules of inheritance,
229360	231120	so he wrote them out in his will,
231120	233640	basically saying, oldest boys first, girls,
233640	235240	only if there aren't any boys,
235240	236600	and parliament approved the rules,
236600	239240	which should have made everything neat and tidy,
239240	241760	but were about to enter the really messy time,
241760	245480	because Henry's son lived just long enough to screw it up,
245480	247080	inheriting the throne at nine.
247080	248720	There was, of course, a scheming protector
248720	250960	at running things, yet he still declared at 15
250960	252360	that his father's rules were dumb,
252360	253400	and his sisters were dumb,
253400	255720	and that his first cousin once removed, Lady Jane Grey,
255720	257320	should be the next monarch instead.
257320	261160	Then he died, and Lady Jane Grey became queen at sweet 16,
261160	265000	sort of, in a disputed status way, for nine days,
265000	266600	until beheaded by Mary,
266600	270320	the first really truly officially nobody-doubts-it queen.
270320	271760	Mary didn't have any kids,
271760	273680	and passed the crown to Elizabeth I,
273680	275640	who became the second queen in a row
275640	278160	to also not have children, but no problem,
278160	281560	because Lady Jane Grey was next in, oh, right.
281560	283720	Now, this is the point at which we acknowledge
283720	284880	Scotland exists.
284880	286360	They'd been doing their own royal thing,
286360	288560	which, for our purposes, joins the English branch,
288560	291120	where Edward III's great-granddaughter married into it
291120	294280	in the 1400s, and then goes James, James, James,
294280	296640	James, James, Mary, Queen of Scots, James,
296640	298520	bringing us back to the 1600s.
298520	300120	Henry VIII's sister, importantly,
300120	302320	also married into this line of the family,
302320	304160	giving it English legitimacy points
304160	305840	in the eyes of the English Parliament,
305840	308120	which asked to borrow Scotland's James,
308120	310000	making him king of two countries,
310000	311600	with two numbers in his name,
311600	313520	depending on where you're counting from.
313520	315200	James had a son, Charles I,
315200	317680	and you might think this unification of the monarchs
317680	319720	means the very messy time is over,
319720	321800	but no, because Cromwell.
321800	323600	Cromwell didn't like kings,
323600	326920	and beheaded Charles I, declaring no royals no longer,
326920	328800	making himself the Lord Protector,
328800	330960	which was in no way like a king,
330960	332600	even though he was in charge,
332600	335240	and it was a hereditary office passed to his son.
335240	336840	But the Cromwells didn't last,
336840	339520	mainly because his son was a fancy country squire
339520	342880	who didn't follow Rule Zero, keep the army happy,
342880	344920	giving Charles' son, Charles II,
344920	347200	the ability to re-establish the monarchy.
347200	348880	Charles II had lots of children,
348880	349920	all of which were illegitimate,
349920	352440	leaving his brother, James II, next in line.
352440	354720	But James II was Catholic,
354720	356560	and ever since Henry split the church,
356560	358880	Catholics had terrible approval ratings.
358880	362080	But conveniently, he had nice Protestant daughters,
362080	364040	one married to a Dutch prince,
364040	365480	who by the nature of these things
365480	367520	was the grandson of Charles I.
367520	369240	Bonus English legitimacy points,
369240	371080	plus who doesn't like the Dutch?
371080	374400	With James so unpopular and William and Mary so popular,
374400	376840	the army and nobles pretty much invited
376840	380400	the royal couple to invade, and James II fled.
380400	382520	William and Mary ruled as co-monarchs,
382520	384920	but without children, the crown went to Queen Anne,
384920	386920	who also didn't produce any heirs,
386920	388600	though not from lack of effort.
388600	391200	She was pregnant 17 times.
391200	392480	Again, finding themselves
392480	394840	with a no-royals-no-longer situation,
394840	397560	Parliament decided it was really truly seriously
397560	399920	the time to sort out the rules of inheritance,
399920	402160	to avoid pretenders from every branch
402160	404640	of this messy tree fighting over the crown.
404640	407240	Parliament did a royal reboot to clear the cruft,
407240	408600	defining Sophia of Hanover,
408600	410360	the granddaughter of James' dual numbers,
410360	413520	to be the new starting point for all claims to the crown.
413520	417380	These rules finally stuck, thus ending the very messy time.
417380	418640	George I, son of Sophia,
418640	420200	was the first king under the new rules,
420200	422200	then his son George II to George III,
422200	424480	and even though he lost America and his mind,
424480	425880	never fear, the rules are here,
425880	428360	so the crown continued to calmly descend the family tree,
428360	431320	going to George IV, who didn't have any surviving children,
431360	434540	to William IV, who had 10 children, all illegitimate,
434540	436620	then passing through his dead younger brother
436620	440120	to Queen Victoria, who started her reign in 1837
440120	441760	and made it to just over the finishing line
441760	442840	of the 20th century,
442840	444880	which is a doubly impressively long time,
444880	446720	given the state of medical technology then.
446720	447800	After the end of her age,
447800	449480	the crown went to her son, Edward VII,
449480	451120	to George V, to Edward VIII,
451120	453360	who finally breaks up this neat and tidy
453360	455120	and somewhat boring line of succession
455120	457640	by committing a scandal, marrying a commoner,
457640	459240	an American commoner,
459240	463000	an American commoner divorcee, twice over.
464080	466420	Actually, the divorces were a real problem
466420	468680	and weren't compatible with the monarch's role
468680	471280	as head of state and also the Church of England
471280	472400	in the 1930s.
472400	475160	Edward abdicated to his brother, George VI,
475160	477120	who was reluctant to take the crown
477120	480140	and then had to oversee World War II
480140	482560	and the subsequent breakup of the British Empire,
482560	484320	which drained the reluctant king's health,
484320	485760	who died at 56,
485760	489080	leaving the crown to Elizabeth II in 1952
489080	490880	at the age of 25.
490880	492720	Seven years older than Victoria,
492720	495840	her great-great-grandmother was on her coronation day,
495840	497760	but in early September 2015,
497760	500160	Elizabeth became the longest reigning queen
500160	502720	in not just British history, but world history.
502720	505760	From Elizabeth II, the crown continues on to Charles,
505760	507920	the longest heir apparent in British history,
507920	510480	to his son, William, to his son, George.
510480	513320	And that is a brief history of the royal family.
