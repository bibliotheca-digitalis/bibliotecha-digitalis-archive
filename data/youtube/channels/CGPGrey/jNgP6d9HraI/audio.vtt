00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
1066. The start of the royal family on these fair isles.

00:03.760 --> 00:08.800
Well, there were kings in many countries before that, and druids before that, and Pangaea before that,

00:08.800 --> 00:11.720
but we have to start somewhere, and a millennia ago is plenty far.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.440
If that leaves out Ã†thelred the Unready, so it goes.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.240
William the Conqueror conquered in the Norman Conquest,

00:17.240 --> 00:19.200
Norman here being code for French.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.600
Because it's the olden days, people had lots of kids, but to keep things simple,

00:22.600 --> 00:28.240
this family tree is going to leave out many of them on each branch, because not every child matters.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.240
So William had three kids we care about, William II, Henry I, and Adela.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.080
If you've seen the video about royal succession, click here if you haven't,

00:35.080 --> 00:38.320
you'll know that formal rules for passing on the crown will get established,

00:38.320 --> 00:41.880
but for now, it's a free-for-all home team advantage to the eldest son.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.200
But never forget, bigger army diplomacy.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.760
Upon William the Conqueror's death, William II became king.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.520
William II didn't marry, and on a bro's day out with Henry,

00:49.520 --> 00:52.440
died in a hunting accident that gave Henry I the crown.

00:52.440 --> 00:56.440
Henry I had at least 26 children, of which only two were 100% legit.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.200
He declared his daughter would rule next, after his son died in a shipwreck,

00:59.200 --> 01:02.320
and swore his knights to honor Empress Matilda by crossing their hearts, hoping to die,

01:02.320 --> 01:03.800
sticking a needle in their eye.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.360
But, when Henry I died while Matilda was in France,

01:06.360 --> 01:09.240
many ignored this while her cousin, Stephen, raced to Westminster,

01:09.240 --> 01:12.120
using faster army diplomacy to get coronated first.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.440
Empress Matilda did eventually return, and start a decades-long civil war

01:15.440 --> 01:19.560
that was pretty much a stalemate, because turtling in the 1100s was an effective RTS tactic.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.040
While she did rule part of the island, as Matilda never had an official coronation,

01:23.040 --> 01:24.680
her monarchal status is disputed.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.800
Now, as Stephen's children were either dead, disinterested, or a nun,

01:27.800 --> 01:31.480
his crown went to his nephew, Henry II, who had four sons,

01:31.480 --> 01:34.640
Henry the Young, Richard the Lionheart, King John, and... Jeff.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.000
Guess who died before his turn?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.520
Henry II saw the history thus far of conquering, assassination, maybe,

01:39.520 --> 01:43.920
usurpation, attritional war, and decided, waiting until after the death of the current king,

01:43.920 --> 01:46.400
before sorting out the next king, didn't work.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.120
So Henry II changed the system, and crowned Henry the Young,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.600
co-king with him, invoking the rule of two.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.760
One is none.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.600
Two is one.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.240
Important, you need a backup.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.760
It was a good plan for stability, helped by the young king's popularity,

01:58.760 --> 02:01.520
but unfortunately, the apprentice rebelled against the master,

02:01.520 --> 02:04.880
rallying his brothers, which resulted in another civil war of disputed monarchs,

02:04.880 --> 02:08.040
during which Henry the Young died of dysentery, Henry the Elder died of fever,

02:08.040 --> 02:09.520
and Richard I took the crown.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.760
After Richard came John, and four eldest sons' successions in a row.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.640
John to Henry III, insert Magna Carta here, to Edward I,

02:15.640 --> 02:17.640
Longshanks to Edward II, to Edward III.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.240
Actually, Ed II was overthrown by Isabelle of France,

02:20.240 --> 02:23.400
AKA the She-Wolf of France, AKA his wife.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.760
After deposing her husband, she acted as regent for their son.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.080
Every one of these arrows glosses over a bit of complexity.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.600
Edward III had five sons, Edward the Black Prince,

02:32.600 --> 02:36.240
Lionel, John, Edmund, and Thomas, none of which would wear the crown.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.320
When Edward III died, his throne would have gone to the Black Prince,

02:39.320 --> 02:42.720
but he was dead at the time, so the crown went to his boringly named son Richard,

02:42.720 --> 02:43.640
now the Second.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.960
There's a bunch of drama-lama stuff around Richard II,

02:45.960 --> 02:47.720
which your English teacher might force you to read about,

02:47.720 --> 02:50.640
but spoiler alert, history's ending is always the same.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.040
Bigger army diplomacy.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.520
This time from Henry IV, who gets the crown,

02:54.520 --> 02:56.960
and Richard II gets starvation in captivity.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.560
Another Henry before we get to the War of the Roses,

02:59.560 --> 03:01.480
a war that strikes terror and boredom

03:01.480 --> 03:03.560
in the minds of students of history the nation over,

03:03.560 --> 03:06.840
who have to deal with this family tree, simplified,

03:06.840 --> 03:08.880
to explain why everyone was angry.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.040
But the shortest version ever is Edward III's great-great-grandsons duked it out,

03:13.040 --> 03:15.240
even though one of them was dead for part of the fight,

03:15.240 --> 03:16.200
but we can't get into that now,

03:16.200 --> 03:19.200
so Henry VI to Edward IV, to Henry VI to Edward IV, the end.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.760
Edward IV, on his deathbed, left his crown to his son,

03:21.760 --> 03:23.600
but being 12, he needed protection,

03:23.600 --> 03:25.840
so Richard, his bestest uncle in the world,

03:25.840 --> 03:27.600
promised to take super good care of him.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.840
Edward V then promptly disappeared under suspicious circumstances

03:30.840 --> 03:33.040
that left Richard to become Richard III.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.280
But he didn't stay king for long,

03:34.280 --> 03:38.040
because Edward III's great-great-great-great-grandson Henry VII

03:38.040 --> 03:40.160
took the crown, put a ring on Elizabeth of York

03:40.160 --> 03:42.040
to lock down that royal legitimacy,

03:42.040 --> 03:45.440
and then sired Henry VIII, splitter of churches and ladies.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.480
Henry VIII thought it was high time

03:47.480 --> 03:49.360
to formalize the rules of inheritance,

03:49.360 --> 03:51.120
so he wrote them out in his will,

03:51.120 --> 03:53.640
basically saying, oldest boys first, girls,

03:53.640 --> 03:55.240
only if there aren't any boys,

03:55.240 --> 03:56.600
and parliament approved the rules,

03:56.600 --> 03:59.240
which should have made everything neat and tidy,

03:59.240 --> 04:01.760
but were about to enter the really messy time,

04:01.760 --> 04:05.480
because Henry's son lived just long enough to screw it up,

04:05.480 --> 04:07.080
inheriting the throne at nine.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.720
There was, of course, a scheming protector

04:08.720 --> 04:10.960
at running things, yet he still declared at 15

04:10.960 --> 04:12.360
that his father's rules were dumb,

04:12.360 --> 04:13.400
and his sisters were dumb,

04:13.400 --> 04:15.720
and that his first cousin once removed, Lady Jane Grey,

04:15.720 --> 04:17.320
should be the next monarch instead.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.160
Then he died, and Lady Jane Grey became queen at sweet 16,

04:21.160 --> 04:25.000
sort of, in a disputed status way, for nine days,

04:25.000 --> 04:26.600
until beheaded by Mary,

04:26.600 --> 04:30.320
the first really truly officially nobody-doubts-it queen.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.760
Mary didn't have any kids,

04:31.760 --> 04:33.680
and passed the crown to Elizabeth I,

04:33.680 --> 04:35.640
who became the second queen in a row

04:35.640 --> 04:38.160
to also not have children, but no problem,

04:38.160 --> 04:41.560
because Lady Jane Grey was next in, oh, right.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.720
Now, this is the point at which we acknowledge

04:43.720 --> 04:44.880
Scotland exists.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.360
They'd been doing their own royal thing,

04:46.360 --> 04:48.560
which, for our purposes, joins the English branch,

04:48.560 --> 04:51.120
where Edward III's great-granddaughter married into it

04:51.120 --> 04:54.280
in the 1400s, and then goes James, James, James,

04:54.280 --> 04:56.640
James, James, Mary, Queen of Scots, James,

04:56.640 --> 04:58.520
bringing us back to the 1600s.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.120
Henry VIII's sister, importantly,

05:00.120 --> 05:02.320
also married into this line of the family,

05:02.320 --> 05:04.160
giving it English legitimacy points

05:04.160 --> 05:05.840
in the eyes of the English Parliament,

05:05.840 --> 05:08.120
which asked to borrow Scotland's James,

05:08.120 --> 05:10.000
making him king of two countries,

05:10.000 --> 05:11.600
with two numbers in his name,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.520
depending on where you're counting from.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.200
James had a son, Charles I,

05:15.200 --> 05:17.680
and you might think this unification of the monarchs

05:17.680 --> 05:19.720
means the very messy time is over,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.800
but no, because Cromwell.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.600
Cromwell didn't like kings,

05:23.600 --> 05:26.920
and beheaded Charles I, declaring no royals no longer,

05:26.920 --> 05:28.800
making himself the Lord Protector,

05:28.800 --> 05:30.960
which was in no way like a king,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.600
even though he was in charge,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.240
and it was a hereditary office passed to his son.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.840
But the Cromwells didn't last,

05:36.840 --> 05:39.520
mainly because his son was a fancy country squire

05:39.520 --> 05:42.880
who didn't follow Rule Zero, keep the army happy,

05:42.880 --> 05:44.920
giving Charles' son, Charles II,

05:44.920 --> 05:47.200
the ability to re-establish the monarchy.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.880
Charles II had lots of children,

05:48.880 --> 05:49.920
all of which were illegitimate,

05:49.920 --> 05:52.440
leaving his brother, James II, next in line.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.720
But James II was Catholic,

05:54.720 --> 05:56.560
and ever since Henry split the church,

05:56.560 --> 05:58.880
Catholics had terrible approval ratings.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.080
But conveniently, he had nice Protestant daughters,

06:02.080 --> 06:04.040
one married to a Dutch prince,

06:04.040 --> 06:05.480
who by the nature of these things

06:05.480 --> 06:07.520
was the grandson of Charles I.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.240
Bonus English legitimacy points,

06:09.240 --> 06:11.080
plus who doesn't like the Dutch?

06:11.080 --> 06:14.400
With James so unpopular and William and Mary so popular,

06:14.400 --> 06:16.840
the army and nobles pretty much invited

06:16.840 --> 06:20.400
the royal couple to invade, and James II fled.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.520
William and Mary ruled as co-monarchs,

06:22.520 --> 06:24.920
but without children, the crown went to Queen Anne,

06:24.920 --> 06:26.920
who also didn't produce any heirs,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.600
though not from lack of effort.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.200
She was pregnant 17 times.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.480
Again, finding themselves

06:32.480 --> 06:34.840
with a no-royals-no-longer situation,

06:34.840 --> 06:37.560
Parliament decided it was really truly seriously

06:37.560 --> 06:39.920
the time to sort out the rules of inheritance,

06:39.920 --> 06:42.160
to avoid pretenders from every branch

06:42.160 --> 06:44.640
of this messy tree fighting over the crown.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.240
Parliament did a royal reboot to clear the cruft,

06:47.240 --> 06:48.600
defining Sophia of Hanover,

06:48.600 --> 06:50.360
the granddaughter of James' dual numbers,

06:50.360 --> 06:53.520
to be the new starting point for all claims to the crown.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.380
These rules finally stuck, thus ending the very messy time.

06:57.380 --> 06:58.640
George I, son of Sophia,

06:58.640 --> 07:00.200
was the first king under the new rules,

07:00.200 --> 07:02.200
then his son George II to George III,

07:02.200 --> 07:04.480
and even though he lost America and his mind,

07:04.480 --> 07:05.880
never fear, the rules are here,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.360
so the crown continued to calmly descend the family tree,

07:08.360 --> 07:11.320
going to George IV, who didn't have any surviving children,

07:11.360 --> 07:14.540
to William IV, who had 10 children, all illegitimate,

07:14.540 --> 07:16.620
then passing through his dead younger brother

07:16.620 --> 07:20.120
to Queen Victoria, who started her reign in 1837

07:20.120 --> 07:21.760
and made it to just over the finishing line

07:21.760 --> 07:22.840
of the 20th century,

07:22.840 --> 07:24.880
which is a doubly impressively long time,

07:24.880 --> 07:26.720
given the state of medical technology then.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.800
After the end of her age,

07:27.800 --> 07:29.480
the crown went to her son, Edward VII,

07:29.480 --> 07:31.120
to George V, to Edward VIII,

07:31.120 --> 07:33.360
who finally breaks up this neat and tidy

07:33.360 --> 07:35.120
and somewhat boring line of succession

07:35.120 --> 07:37.640
by committing a scandal, marrying a commoner,

07:37.640 --> 07:39.240
an American commoner,

07:39.240 --> 07:43.000
an American commoner divorcee, twice over.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.420
Actually, the divorces were a real problem

07:46.420 --> 07:48.680
and weren't compatible with the monarch's role

07:48.680 --> 07:51.280
as head of state and also the Church of England

07:51.280 --> 07:52.400
in the 1930s.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.160
Edward abdicated to his brother, George VI,

07:55.160 --> 07:57.120
who was reluctant to take the crown

07:57.120 --> 08:00.140
and then had to oversee World War II

08:00.140 --> 08:02.560
and the subsequent breakup of the British Empire,

08:02.560 --> 08:04.320
which drained the reluctant king's health,

08:04.320 --> 08:05.760
who died at 56,

08:05.760 --> 08:09.080
leaving the crown to Elizabeth II in 1952

08:09.080 --> 08:10.880
at the age of 25.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.720
Seven years older than Victoria,

08:12.720 --> 08:15.840
her great-great-grandmother was on her coronation day,

08:15.840 --> 08:17.760
but in early September 2015,

08:17.760 --> 08:20.160
Elizabeth became the longest reigning queen

08:20.160 --> 08:22.720
in not just British history, but world history.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.760
From Elizabeth II, the crown continues on to Charles,

08:25.760 --> 08:27.920
the longest heir apparent in British history,

08:27.920 --> 08:30.480
to his son, William, to his son, George.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.320
And that is a brief history of the royal family.
