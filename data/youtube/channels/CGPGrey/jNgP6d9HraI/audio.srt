1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
1066. The start of the royal family on these fair isles.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,800
Well, there were kings in many countries before that, and druids before that, and Pangaea before that,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,720
but we have to start somewhere, and a millennia ago is plenty far.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,440
If that leaves out Ã†thelred the Unready, so it goes.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,240
William the Conqueror conquered in the Norman Conquest,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,200
Norman here being code for French.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,600
Because it's the olden days, people had lots of kids, but to keep things simple,

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,240
this family tree is going to leave out many of them on each branch, because not every child matters.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,240
So William had three kids we care about, William II, Henry I, and Adela.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,080
If you've seen the video about royal succession, click here if you haven't,

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,320
you'll know that formal rules for passing on the crown will get established,

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,880
but for now, it's a free-for-all home team advantage to the eldest son.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,200
But never forget, bigger army diplomacy.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,760
Upon William the Conqueror's death, William II became king.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,520
William II didn't marry, and on a bro's day out with Henry,

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,440
died in a hunting accident that gave Henry I the crown.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Henry I had at least 26 children, of which only two were 100% legit.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,200
He declared his daughter would rule next, after his son died in a shipwreck,

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,320
and swore his knights to honor Empress Matilda by crossing their hearts, hoping to die,

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,800
sticking a needle in their eye.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,360
But, when Henry I died while Matilda was in France,

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,240
many ignored this while her cousin, Stephen, raced to Westminster,

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,120
using faster army diplomacy to get coronated first.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,440
Empress Matilda did eventually return, and start a decades-long civil war

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,560
that was pretty much a stalemate, because turtling in the 1100s was an effective RTS tactic.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,040
While she did rule part of the island, as Matilda never had an official coronation,

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,680
her monarchal status is disputed.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,800
Now, as Stephen's children were either dead, disinterested, or a nun,

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,480
his crown went to his nephew, Henry II, who had four sons,

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,640
Henry the Young, Richard the Lionheart, King John, and... Jeff.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
Guess who died before his turn?

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
Henry II saw the history thus far of conquering, assassination, maybe,

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
usurpation, attritional war, and decided, waiting until after the death of the current king,

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,400
before sorting out the next king, didn't work.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,120
So Henry II changed the system, and crowned Henry the Young,

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,600
co-king with him, invoking the rule of two.

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
One is none.

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,600
Two is one.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,240
Important, you need a backup.

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,760
It was a good plan for stability, helped by the young king's popularity,

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,520
but unfortunately, the apprentice rebelled against the master,

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,880
rallying his brothers, which resulted in another civil war of disputed monarchs,

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,040
during which Henry the Young died of dysentery, Henry the Elder died of fever,

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,520
and Richard I took the crown.

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,760
After Richard came John, and four eldest sons' successions in a row.

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,640
John to Henry III, insert Magna Carta here, to Edward I,

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Longshanks to Edward II, to Edward III.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,240
Actually, Ed II was overthrown by Isabelle of France,

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,400
AKA the She-Wolf of France, AKA his wife.

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,760
After deposing her husband, she acted as regent for their son.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,080
Every one of these arrows glosses over a bit of complexity.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,600
Edward III had five sons, Edward the Black Prince,

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,240
Lionel, John, Edmund, and Thomas, none of which would wear the crown.

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,320
When Edward III died, his throne would have gone to the Black Prince,

55
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,720
but he was dead at the time, so the crown went to his boringly named son Richard,

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,640
now the Second.

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,960
There's a bunch of drama-lama stuff around Richard II,

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
which your English teacher might force you to read about,

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,640
but spoiler alert, history's ending is always the same.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,040
Bigger army diplomacy.

61
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,520
This time from Henry IV, who gets the crown,

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,960
and Richard II gets starvation in captivity.

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,560
Another Henry before we get to the War of the Roses,

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,480
a war that strikes terror and boredom

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,560
in the minds of students of history the nation over,

66
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,840
who have to deal with this family tree, simplified,

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
to explain why everyone was angry.

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,040
But the shortest version ever is Edward III's great-great-grandsons duked it out,

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,240
even though one of them was dead for part of the fight,

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,200
but we can't get into that now,

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
so Henry VI to Edward IV, to Henry VI to Edward IV, the end.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
Edward IV, on his deathbed, left his crown to his son,

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,600
but being 12, he needed protection,

74
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,840
so Richard, his bestest uncle in the world,

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
promised to take super good care of him.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,840
Edward V then promptly disappeared under suspicious circumstances

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,040
that left Richard to become Richard III.

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
But he didn't stay king for long,

79
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,040
because Edward III's great-great-great-great-grandson Henry VII

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
took the crown, put a ring on Elizabeth of York

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,040
to lock down that royal legitimacy,

82
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,440
and then sired Henry VIII, splitter of churches and ladies.

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Henry VIII thought it was high time

84
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,360
to formalize the rules of inheritance,

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
so he wrote them out in his will,

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,640
basically saying, oldest boys first, girls,

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,240
only if there aren't any boys,

88
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,600
and parliament approved the rules,

89
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,240
which should have made everything neat and tidy,

90
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,760
but were about to enter the really messy time,

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,480
because Henry's son lived just long enough to screw it up,

92
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,080
inheriting the throne at nine.

93
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,720
There was, of course, a scheming protector

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,960
at running things, yet he still declared at 15

95
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,360
that his father's rules were dumb,

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
and his sisters were dumb,

97
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,720
and that his first cousin once removed, Lady Jane Grey,

98
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,320
should be the next monarch instead.

99
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,160
Then he died, and Lady Jane Grey became queen at sweet 16,

100
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,000
sort of, in a disputed status way, for nine days,

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
until beheaded by Mary,

102
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,320
the first really truly officially nobody-doubts-it queen.

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
Mary didn't have any kids,

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,680
and passed the crown to Elizabeth I,

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,640
who became the second queen in a row

106
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,160
to also not have children, but no problem,

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,560
because Lady Jane Grey was next in, oh, right.

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,720
Now, this is the point at which we acknowledge

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
Scotland exists.

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,360
They'd been doing their own royal thing,

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,560
which, for our purposes, joins the English branch,

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
where Edward III's great-granddaughter married into it

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,280
in the 1400s, and then goes James, James, James,

114
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,640
James, James, Mary, Queen of Scots, James,

115
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,520
bringing us back to the 1600s.

116
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
Henry VIII's sister, importantly,

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,320
also married into this line of the family,

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
giving it English legitimacy points

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
in the eyes of the English Parliament,

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,120
which asked to borrow Scotland's James,

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,000
making him king of two countries,

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
with two numbers in his name,

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
depending on where you're counting from.

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,200
James had a son, Charles I,

125
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,680
and you might think this unification of the monarchs

126
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,720
means the very messy time is over,

127
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,800
but no, because Cromwell.

128
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Cromwell didn't like kings,

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,920
and beheaded Charles I, declaring no royals no longer,

130
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,800
making himself the Lord Protector,

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
which was in no way like a king,

132
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,600
even though he was in charge,

133
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,240
and it was a hereditary office passed to his son.

134
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
But the Cromwells didn't last,

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
mainly because his son was a fancy country squire

136
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,880
who didn't follow Rule Zero, keep the army happy,

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,920
giving Charles' son, Charles II,

138
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,200
the ability to re-establish the monarchy.

139
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
Charles II had lots of children,

140
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
all of which were illegitimate,

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,440
leaving his brother, James II, next in line.

142
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,720
But James II was Catholic,

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,560
and ever since Henry split the church,

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
Catholics had terrible approval ratings.

145
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,080
But conveniently, he had nice Protestant daughters,

146
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,040
one married to a Dutch prince,

147
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,480
who by the nature of these things

148
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,520
was the grandson of Charles I.

149
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,240
Bonus English legitimacy points,

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,080
plus who doesn't like the Dutch?

151
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,400
With James so unpopular and William and Mary so popular,

152
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,840
the army and nobles pretty much invited

153
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,400
the royal couple to invade, and James II fled.

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,520
William and Mary ruled as co-monarchs,

155
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,920
but without children, the crown went to Queen Anne,

156
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
who also didn't produce any heirs,

157
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,600
though not from lack of effort.

158
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,200
She was pregnant 17 times.

159
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
Again, finding themselves

160
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,840
with a no-royals-no-longer situation,

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,560
Parliament decided it was really truly seriously

162
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,920
the time to sort out the rules of inheritance,

163
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,160
to avoid pretenders from every branch

164
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
of this messy tree fighting over the crown.

165
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Parliament did a royal reboot to clear the cruft,

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
defining Sophia of Hanover,

167
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
the granddaughter of James' dual numbers,

168
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,520
to be the new starting point for all claims to the crown.

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,380
These rules finally stuck, thus ending the very messy time.

170
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,640
George I, son of Sophia,

171
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
was the first king under the new rules,

172
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
then his son George II to George III,

173
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,480
and even though he lost America and his mind,

174
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,880
never fear, the rules are here,

175
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,360
so the crown continued to calmly descend the family tree,

176
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,320
going to George IV, who didn't have any surviving children,

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,540
to William IV, who had 10 children, all illegitimate,

178
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,620
then passing through his dead younger brother

179
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,120
to Queen Victoria, who started her reign in 1837

180
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,760
and made it to just over the finishing line

181
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
of the 20th century,

182
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,880
which is a doubly impressively long time,

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
given the state of medical technology then.

184
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,800
After the end of her age,

185
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
the crown went to her son, Edward VII,

186
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
to George V, to Edward VIII,

187
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
who finally breaks up this neat and tidy

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
and somewhat boring line of succession

189
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,640
by committing a scandal, marrying a commoner,

190
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,240
an American commoner,

191
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,000
an American commoner divorcee, twice over.

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,420
Actually, the divorces were a real problem

193
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,680
and weren't compatible with the monarch's role

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,280
as head of state and also the Church of England

195
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,400
in the 1930s.

196
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,160
Edward abdicated to his brother, George VI,

197
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,120
who was reluctant to take the crown

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,140
and then had to oversee World War II

199
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,560
and the subsequent breakup of the British Empire,

200
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,320
which drained the reluctant king's health,

201
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
who died at 56,

202
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,080
leaving the crown to Elizabeth II in 1952

203
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,880
at the age of 25.

204
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,720
Seven years older than Victoria,

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
her great-great-grandmother was on her coronation day,

206
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,760
but in early September 2015,

207
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Elizabeth became the longest reigning queen

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
in not just British history, but world history.

209
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,760
From Elizabeth II, the crown continues on to Charles,

210
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
the longest heir apparent in British history,

211
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,480
to his son, William, to his son, George.

212
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,320
And that is a brief history of the royal family.
