00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
Hello internet.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,320
In my last video about Pluto you may have noticed that I said aloud the names of every

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,880
planet except one.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,880
This one.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,160
And that was no accident but rather the result of careful script editing because where I

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,000
grew up I learned that the name of the seventh planet is pronounced Uranus.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,760
Of course to a kid Uranus sounds an awful lot like Uranus which is how I and everyone

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,520
else I knew ended up saying the name which is funny when you're a child but becomes a

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,560
bit of a problem when you grow up and try to teach scientific facts about the planet.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
For example Uranus has a ring around it.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,040
Astronomers have discovered a dark spot on Uranus.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
Uranus is a gas giant.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,600
Uranus is surrounded by methane.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,900
There is a solution to this problem.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,240
The alternative pronunciation of the name which goes Uranus.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,480
And most scientists in public roles do use this pronunciation.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,760
But for me Uranus is still problematic.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,200
Sure it's better than Uranus but it's still Uranus.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,320
And perhaps I'm just childish but when someone else says Uranus I still hear Uranus in my

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,400
head and it just draws more attention to the unfortunate name.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,280
The tragedy is it didn't have to be this way.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,120
The seventh planet from the Sun is unique because it's the first planet we discovered.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,840
For all of human history the six closest planets were big enough or bright enough to see with

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
just our limited simian eyes.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,580
But the next planet was too dim to see until our telescope technology got good enough for

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,280
British astronomer William Herschel to spot it in 1781.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
Understandably though he didn't think he'd discovered a new planet since from the rise

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,960
of modern humans 50,000 years earlier until that Tuesday no one ever had.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
But discover he did and so choose a name he must.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,080
And Herschel being the good subject of the crown that he was christened his new planet

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,180
the Georgium Sidus which means the Georgian Star.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,720
And the George in that Georgian Star was King George III the reigning monarch.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,960
While King George liked the name the rest of the world did not and decided that perhaps

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,040
Herschel wasn't the best guy to name the new planet after all and quickly decided to come

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,920
up with alternatives of their own.

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,580
One suggestion was Neptune which is confusing to us now but at the time the planet that

37
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,720
would become Neptune had not yet been found.

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,400
A more obvious alternative was to name the planet Herschel after the man who discovered

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
it.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,880
Even in Great Britain the name the Georgium Sidus proved a bit stuffy for some so variants

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,040
like the Georgian planet or just Georgium were also used.

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Though never as you might have heard George.

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,960
Side note here while researching this video I found a lot of websites claiming that the

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,160
seventh planet was almost named George but I was never able to find a primary source

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
for this.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
As best I could tell searching through documents from the time no one ever suggested this name.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,280
I checked with the Royal Institution who since 1799 has been promoting science awesomeness

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,960
from the heart of London and whose videos you should now go watch.

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,200
And they confirmed the name George was never on the table because to so casually refer

50
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,880
to the king at the time would have been disrespectful.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,760
And disrespecting a monarch is never a good idea.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
Especially one who is slowly losing his mind from a genetic disorder.

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,080
But that's a story for another time.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,860
Anyway another real suggestion for the new planet's name came from Johann Bode who suggested

55
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,600
the Greek god of the sky.

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,280
When a colleague of Bode discovered the 92nd element in 1789 he named it Uranium to support

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,920
Bode's choice and try and end the debate.

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,060
Perhaps because these two were German it might not have occurred to them how the word would

59
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,200
eventually be corrupted in English.

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,320
Though it's also hard to know how English speakers in the 1780s and 90s would have pronounced

61
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
the name.

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,080
But since the word Anus was in the language then it seems unlikely that this particular

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
pronunciation would have been popular.

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,320
It may also have been pronounced with a flat A to sound like Uranus or something more like

65
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,300
the Greek name Uranus.

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,360
These names competed with each other over decades.

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,360
For example still in 1823 the Encyclopedia Britannica lists the planet as Herschel, notes

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,060
the alternative names and then proceeds to carefully word the rest of the article to

69
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,620
avoid naming the planet again.

70
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,120
But you dear modern viewer know that eventually these alternatives faded and left this name

71
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,260
triumphant.

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,120
Which leaves someone like me with my terrible pronunciation longing for history to have

73
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,960
taken a different path.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,220
The name Herschel might have made the planet sound a bit like a boring accountant rather

75
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,780
than the very interesting planet it actually is.

76
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,340
But this would still be a much better name than what we have.

77
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,980
Neptune is obviously a fine planetary name though picking this might have just delayed

78
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,980
the problem.

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,860
Finally, the George M.Citus is a bit awkward and in sillier moments I wish that Herschel

80
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,400
had just been more direct and named it King George.

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,220
Because how fun would that make it to teach kids the list of planets today?

82
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,560
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, King George and Neptune.

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,460
In classrooms such an unusual name would change the planet from a thing to avoid to a starting

84
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,300
point for discussions about what makes that planet different and how astronomy and our

85
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,500
view of the universe change and progress over time.

86
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,440
But my impractical dreams aside, we're stuck with this name.

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,860
Which for me means choosing between the pronunciation which comes naturally and is terrible or the

88
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,220
unnatural awkward one which is still unsatisfactory.

89
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
So what's a man to do?

90
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,020
In the end probably follow the lead of the encyclopedia Britannica and avoid the name

91
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,260
when possible which is a sad fate for the planet in our solar system with such an interesting

92
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,260
story to tell.

93
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,260
Uranus.

94
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,220
Uranus.

95
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Uranus.

96
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Uranus.

97
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Uranus.

98
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
Uranus.

99
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,980
Seriously people, could we at least agree to switch the pronunciation back to the Greek

100
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
Uranus?

101
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,100
It's clearly so much better.
