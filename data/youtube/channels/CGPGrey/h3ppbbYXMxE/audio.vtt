00:00.000 --> 00:02.140
Hello internet.

00:02.140 --> 00:05.320
In my last video about Pluto you may have noticed that I said aloud the names of every

00:05.320 --> 00:06.880
planet except one.

00:06.880 --> 00:07.880
This one.

00:07.880 --> 00:11.160
And that was no accident but rather the result of careful script editing because where I

00:11.160 --> 00:15.000
grew up I learned that the name of the seventh planet is pronounced Uranus.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.760
Of course to a kid Uranus sounds an awful lot like Uranus which is how I and everyone

00:19.760 --> 00:23.520
else I knew ended up saying the name which is funny when you're a child but becomes a

00:23.520 --> 00:27.560
bit of a problem when you grow up and try to teach scientific facts about the planet.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.840
For example Uranus has a ring around it.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.040
Astronomers have discovered a dark spot on Uranus.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.480
Uranus is a gas giant.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.600
Uranus is surrounded by methane.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.900
There is a solution to this problem.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.240
The alternative pronunciation of the name which goes Uranus.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.480
And most scientists in public roles do use this pronunciation.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.760
But for me Uranus is still problematic.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.200
Sure it's better than Uranus but it's still Uranus.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.320
And perhaps I'm just childish but when someone else says Uranus I still hear Uranus in my

00:54.320 --> 00:57.400
head and it just draws more attention to the unfortunate name.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.280
The tragedy is it didn't have to be this way.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.120
The seventh planet from the Sun is unique because it's the first planet we discovered.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.840
For all of human history the six closest planets were big enough or bright enough to see with

01:07.840 --> 01:09.920
just our limited simian eyes.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.580
But the next planet was too dim to see until our telescope technology got good enough for

01:13.580 --> 01:17.280
British astronomer William Herschel to spot it in 1781.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.320
Understandably though he didn't think he'd discovered a new planet since from the rise

01:20.320 --> 01:24.960
of modern humans 50,000 years earlier until that Tuesday no one ever had.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.680
But discover he did and so choose a name he must.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.080
And Herschel being the good subject of the crown that he was christened his new planet

01:31.080 --> 01:34.180
the Georgium Sidus which means the Georgian Star.

01:34.180 --> 01:38.720
And the George in that Georgian Star was King George III the reigning monarch.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.960
While King George liked the name the rest of the world did not and decided that perhaps

01:41.960 --> 01:46.040
Herschel wasn't the best guy to name the new planet after all and quickly decided to come

01:46.040 --> 01:47.920
up with alternatives of their own.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.580
One suggestion was Neptune which is confusing to us now but at the time the planet that

01:51.580 --> 01:53.720
would become Neptune had not yet been found.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.400
A more obvious alternative was to name the planet Herschel after the man who discovered

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
it.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.880
Even in Great Britain the name the Georgium Sidus proved a bit stuffy for some so variants

02:01.880 --> 02:05.040
like the Georgian planet or just Georgium were also used.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.560
Though never as you might have heard George.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.960
Side note here while researching this video I found a lot of websites claiming that the

02:10.960 --> 02:15.160
seventh planet was almost named George but I was never able to find a primary source

02:15.160 --> 02:16.160
for this.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.000
As best I could tell searching through documents from the time no one ever suggested this name.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.280
I checked with the Royal Institution who since 1799 has been promoting science awesomeness

02:24.280 --> 02:26.960
from the heart of London and whose videos you should now go watch.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.200
And they confirmed the name George was never on the table because to so casually refer

02:30.200 --> 02:32.880
to the king at the time would have been disrespectful.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.760
And disrespecting a monarch is never a good idea.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.040
Especially one who is slowly losing his mind from a genetic disorder.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.080
But that's a story for another time.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.860
Anyway another real suggestion for the new planet's name came from Johann Bode who suggested

02:44.860 --> 02:46.600
the Greek god of the sky.

02:46.600 --> 02:51.280
When a colleague of Bode discovered the 92nd element in 1789 he named it Uranium to support

02:51.280 --> 02:53.920
Bode's choice and try and end the debate.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.060
Perhaps because these two were German it might not have occurred to them how the word would

02:57.060 --> 02:59.200
eventually be corrupted in English.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.320
Though it's also hard to know how English speakers in the 1780s and 90s would have pronounced

03:03.320 --> 03:04.320
the name.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.080
But since the word Anus was in the language then it seems unlikely that this particular

03:08.080 --> 03:09.840
pronunciation would have been popular.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.320
It may also have been pronounced with a flat A to sound like Uranus or something more like

03:14.320 --> 03:16.300
the Greek name Uranus.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.360
These names competed with each other over decades.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.360
For example still in 1823 the Encyclopedia Britannica lists the planet as Herschel, notes

03:23.360 --> 03:27.060
the alternative names and then proceeds to carefully word the rest of the article to

03:27.060 --> 03:28.620
avoid naming the planet again.

03:28.620 --> 03:33.120
But you dear modern viewer know that eventually these alternatives faded and left this name

03:33.120 --> 03:34.260
triumphant.

03:34.260 --> 03:38.120
Which leaves someone like me with my terrible pronunciation longing for history to have

03:38.120 --> 03:39.960
taken a different path.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.220
The name Herschel might have made the planet sound a bit like a boring accountant rather

03:43.220 --> 03:45.780
than the very interesting planet it actually is.

03:45.780 --> 03:48.340
But this would still be a much better name than what we have.

03:48.340 --> 03:51.980
Neptune is obviously a fine planetary name though picking this might have just delayed

03:51.980 --> 03:52.980
the problem.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.860
Finally, the George M.Citus is a bit awkward and in sillier moments I wish that Herschel

03:56.860 --> 03:59.400
had just been more direct and named it King George.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.220
Because how fun would that make it to teach kids the list of planets today?

04:02.220 --> 04:06.560
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, King George and Neptune.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.460
In classrooms such an unusual name would change the planet from a thing to avoid to a starting

04:10.460 --> 04:14.300
point for discussions about what makes that planet different and how astronomy and our

04:14.300 --> 04:17.500
view of the universe change and progress over time.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.440
But my impractical dreams aside, we're stuck with this name.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.860
Which for me means choosing between the pronunciation which comes naturally and is terrible or the

04:24.860 --> 04:28.220
unnatural awkward one which is still unsatisfactory.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.220
So what's a man to do?

04:29.220 --> 04:33.020
In the end probably follow the lead of the encyclopedia Britannica and avoid the name

04:33.020 --> 04:37.260
when possible which is a sad fate for the planet in our solar system with such an interesting

04:37.260 --> 04:39.260
story to tell.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.260
Uranus.

04:41.260 --> 04:43.220
Uranus.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.220
Uranus.

04:45.220 --> 04:47.220
Uranus.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.220
Uranus.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.220
Uranus.

04:51.220 --> 04:53.980
Seriously people, could we at least agree to switch the pronunciation back to the Greek

04:53.980 --> 04:54.980
Uranus?

04:54.980 --> 04:56.100
It's clearly so much better.
