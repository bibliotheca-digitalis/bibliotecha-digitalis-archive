0	2140	Hello internet.
2140	5320	In my last video about Pluto you may have noticed that I said aloud the names of every
5320	6880	planet except one.
6880	7880	This one.
7880	11160	And that was no accident but rather the result of careful script editing because where I
11160	15000	grew up I learned that the name of the seventh planet is pronounced Uranus.
15000	19760	Of course to a kid Uranus sounds an awful lot like Uranus which is how I and everyone
19760	23520	else I knew ended up saying the name which is funny when you're a child but becomes a
23520	27560	bit of a problem when you grow up and try to teach scientific facts about the planet.
27560	29840	For example Uranus has a ring around it.
29840	33040	Astronomers have discovered a dark spot on Uranus.
33040	34480	Uranus is a gas giant.
34480	36600	Uranus is surrounded by methane.
36600	37900	There is a solution to this problem.
37900	41240	The alternative pronunciation of the name which goes Uranus.
41240	44480	And most scientists in public roles do use this pronunciation.
44480	46760	But for me Uranus is still problematic.
46760	50200	Sure it's better than Uranus but it's still Uranus.
50200	54320	And perhaps I'm just childish but when someone else says Uranus I still hear Uranus in my
54320	57400	head and it just draws more attention to the unfortunate name.
57400	60280	The tragedy is it didn't have to be this way.
60280	64120	The seventh planet from the Sun is unique because it's the first planet we discovered.
64120	67840	For all of human history the six closest planets were big enough or bright enough to see with
67840	69920	just our limited simian eyes.
69920	73580	But the next planet was too dim to see until our telescope technology got good enough for
73580	77280	British astronomer William Herschel to spot it in 1781.
77280	80320	Understandably though he didn't think he'd discovered a new planet since from the rise
80320	84960	of modern humans 50,000 years earlier until that Tuesday no one ever had.
84960	87680	But discover he did and so choose a name he must.
87680	91080	And Herschel being the good subject of the crown that he was christened his new planet
91080	94180	the Georgium Sidus which means the Georgian Star.
94180	98720	And the George in that Georgian Star was King George III the reigning monarch.
98720	101960	While King George liked the name the rest of the world did not and decided that perhaps
101960	106040	Herschel wasn't the best guy to name the new planet after all and quickly decided to come
106040	107920	up with alternatives of their own.
107920	111580	One suggestion was Neptune which is confusing to us now but at the time the planet that
111580	113720	would become Neptune had not yet been found.
113720	117400	A more obvious alternative was to name the planet Herschel after the man who discovered
117400	118400	it.
118400	121880	Even in Great Britain the name the Georgium Sidus proved a bit stuffy for some so variants
121880	125040	like the Georgian planet or just Georgium were also used.
125040	127560	Though never as you might have heard George.
127560	130960	Side note here while researching this video I found a lot of websites claiming that the
130960	135160	seventh planet was almost named George but I was never able to find a primary source
135160	136160	for this.
136160	140000	As best I could tell searching through documents from the time no one ever suggested this name.
140000	144280	I checked with the Royal Institution who since 1799 has been promoting science awesomeness
144280	146960	from the heart of London and whose videos you should now go watch.
146960	150200	And they confirmed the name George was never on the table because to so casually refer
150200	152880	to the king at the time would have been disrespectful.
152880	155760	And disrespecting a monarch is never a good idea.
155760	159040	Especially one who is slowly losing his mind from a genetic disorder.
159040	161080	But that's a story for another time.
161080	164860	Anyway another real suggestion for the new planet's name came from Johann Bode who suggested
164860	166600	the Greek god of the sky.
166600	171280	When a colleague of Bode discovered the 92nd element in 1789 he named it Uranium to support
171280	173920	Bode's choice and try and end the debate.
173920	177060	Perhaps because these two were German it might not have occurred to them how the word would
177060	179200	eventually be corrupted in English.
179200	183320	Though it's also hard to know how English speakers in the 1780s and 90s would have pronounced
183320	184320	the name.
184320	188080	But since the word Anus was in the language then it seems unlikely that this particular
188080	189840	pronunciation would have been popular.
189840	194320	It may also have been pronounced with a flat A to sound like Uranus or something more like
194320	196300	the Greek name Uranus.
196300	198360	These names competed with each other over decades.
198360	203360	For example still in 1823 the Encyclopedia Britannica lists the planet as Herschel, notes
203360	207060	the alternative names and then proceeds to carefully word the rest of the article to
207060	208620	avoid naming the planet again.
208620	213120	But you dear modern viewer know that eventually these alternatives faded and left this name
213120	214260	triumphant.
214260	218120	Which leaves someone like me with my terrible pronunciation longing for history to have
218120	219960	taken a different path.
219960	223220	The name Herschel might have made the planet sound a bit like a boring accountant rather
223220	225780	than the very interesting planet it actually is.
225780	228340	But this would still be a much better name than what we have.
228340	231980	Neptune is obviously a fine planetary name though picking this might have just delayed
231980	232980	the problem.
232980	236860	Finally, the George M.Citus is a bit awkward and in sillier moments I wish that Herschel
236860	239400	had just been more direct and named it King George.
239400	242220	Because how fun would that make it to teach kids the list of planets today?
242220	246560	Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, King George and Neptune.
246560	250460	In classrooms such an unusual name would change the planet from a thing to avoid to a starting
250460	254300	point for discussions about what makes that planet different and how astronomy and our
254300	257500	view of the universe change and progress over time.
257500	260440	But my impractical dreams aside, we're stuck with this name.
260440	264860	Which for me means choosing between the pronunciation which comes naturally and is terrible or the
264860	268220	unnatural awkward one which is still unsatisfactory.
268220	269220	So what's a man to do?
269220	273020	In the end probably follow the lead of the encyclopedia Britannica and avoid the name
273020	277260	when possible which is a sad fate for the planet in our solar system with such an interesting
277260	279260	story to tell.
279260	281260	Uranus.
281260	283220	Uranus.
283220	285220	Uranus.
285220	287220	Uranus.
287220	289220	Uranus.
289220	291220	Uranus.
291220	293980	Seriously people, could we at least agree to switch the pronunciation back to the Greek
293980	294980	Uranus?
294980	296100	It's clearly so much better.
