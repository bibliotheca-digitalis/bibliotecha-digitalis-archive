00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
The City of London is a unique place. It's the city in a city, in a country in a country, that runs its government with perhaps the most complicated elections in the world, involving medieval guilds, modern corporations, mandatory titles, and fancy hats.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
All of which are connected in this horrifying org chart. Why so complicated?

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
Though the new skyscrapers might make you think the City of London is relatively young, it's actually the oldest continuous government on the island of Great Britain.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
The City of London predates the empire that Victoria ruled, the kingdoms Anne united, and the Magna Carta that John reluctantly signed.

00:33.000 --> 00:45.000
While the London which surrounds the city only got to electing its first mayor in 2000, the list of mayors who've governed the City of London is almost 700 people long, going back more than a thousand years.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
The City of London's government is so old that there's no surviving record of exactly when it was born.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
There are only documents like the Magna Carta which mention the pre-existing powers the City of London already had at that point in time.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
So while a government like the United States officially gets its power from the people, and parliament gets its power from the crown, which in turn gets it from God,

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
the City of London gets its power from time immemorial, meaning that the city is so old it just is.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
And that age brings with it unusual and complicated traditions.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
The most notable of these perhaps is that in City of London elections, companies get votes. Quite a lot actually.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
About three-fourths of the votes cast in city elections are from companies with the remaining one-fourth from residents.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
The way it works is that the bigger a company is, the more votes it gets from the City of London.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
The companies then give their votes to select employees who work but do not live within the city,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
and it's these employees who do the actual voting at election time.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
The result is that the Common Council, the bureaucratic beating heart of the City of London,

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
has about 20 common councillors elected by residents of the city, and about 80 elected by companies of the city.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
The reasoning behind this unusual tradition is that for every one person who lives in the City of London, 43 people commute in every day.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
In total, that's 300,000 commuters using city services, and whose employment depends on the City of London being business-friendly.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
The man in charge of the Common Council, and who heads the city's government, is the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor of London.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
Now, suppose you want to be Lord Mayor. Surely, just as in that other London, all you'll need do is

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
A. Be a British Commonwealth or EU citizen who has

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
B. Lived in the city for a year and who

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
C. Wins the election. Right? No.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
In the City of London, that's not nearly enough. Ready for the qualifications list?

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Before you can even run for Lord Mayor, you need to have been a Sheriff of the City of London.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
But before you can be Sheriff, you need to be an Aldermen.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
What's an Aldermen? Well, the City of London is divided into 25 wards,

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
and each ward elects one Aldermen to represent it on the Court of Aldermen, a subsection of the Common Council.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
But before you can run for Aldermen, you need to gain Freeman status.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And who gives out Freeman status?

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Why, none other than the very Court of Aldermen you're trying to get elected to,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
which might just seem like a conflict of interest.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Luckily, there is another way to get Freeman status.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Join one of the city's guilds.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Sadly, they aren't called guilds, they're called livery companies,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
a name which is both more boring and less descriptive,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
but the remnants of medieval guilds, many of them are,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
and within the city, there are 108 of them to choose from,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
including, but not limited to, the apothecaries, the fishmongers, the masons, the mercers,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
the scientific instrument makers, the bankers, the shipwrights, the wheelwrights,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
the butchers, the bakers, two different candlestick makers,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
and the most exciting of all, the chartered accountants.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Many of these guilds, like the Fletcher's, have become charities,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
but some are still active, such as the Goldsmiths, who test the quality of British coinage,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
and the Hackney carriage drivers, who license taxi drivers.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
To join one of these guilds, you'll either need to meet the professional requirements,

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
or for the charities, like the Haberdashers, you'll need the approval of two existing members.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
If you meet none of the livery companies' membership requirements,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
but you think you'll be a clever clogs and start your own livery company and grant yourself Freeman's status,

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
tough luck, because new livery companies need to be approved by, you guessed it, the Court of Aldermen.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
But let's assume, one way or another, you get the official Freeman's status certificate.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Now you can finally run for Aldermen of Award,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
after the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee also approves of you.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
But that small barrier passed, you can win election as Aldermen in either one of the four wards where people live,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
or the 21 wards where companies live.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Once on the Court of Aldermen, to continue your path to the mayor's office in Guildhall,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
you must now be elected as sheriff.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
But this time, it's the members of the livery companies who pick the sheriffs.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
So if the livery company members elect you as sheriff, after you have successfully completed your term,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
then you can finally run for mayor.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
But surprisingly, residents of the City of London don't vote for the mayor.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Our old friends on the Court of Aldermen do.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
So in summary, once you get your Freeman's status from either the Court of Aldermen or the livery companies,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
and after your ward elects you as Aldermen, and then the livery companies elect you as sheriff,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
and after your term as sheriff ends, but while you're still on the Court of Aldermen,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
then you can run for mayor.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
And assuming the other aldermen select you, you can finally take your place as the Right Honourable,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
the Lord Mayor of London.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
For one year, with no salary.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And you have to cover your own expenses, which will be quite considerable,

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
as your new job consists mostly of making hundreds of speeches a year around the world promoting city business.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
But you do get that fancy hat, which just might make it all worthwhile.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
you
