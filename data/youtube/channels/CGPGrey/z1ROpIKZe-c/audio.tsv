0	14000	The City of London is a unique place. It's the city in a city, in a country in a country, that runs its government with perhaps the most complicated elections in the world, involving medieval guilds, modern corporations, mandatory titles, and fancy hats.
14000	18000	All of which are connected in this horrifying org chart. Why so complicated?
18000	26000	Though the new skyscrapers might make you think the City of London is relatively young, it's actually the oldest continuous government on the island of Great Britain.
26000	33000	The City of London predates the empire that Victoria ruled, the kingdoms Anne united, and the Magna Carta that John reluctantly signed.
33000	45000	While the London which surrounds the city only got to electing its first mayor in 2000, the list of mayors who've governed the City of London is almost 700 people long, going back more than a thousand years.
45000	51000	The City of London's government is so old that there's no surviving record of exactly when it was born.
51000	58000	There are only documents like the Magna Carta which mention the pre-existing powers the City of London already had at that point in time.
58000	66000	So while a government like the United States officially gets its power from the people, and parliament gets its power from the crown, which in turn gets it from God,
66000	73000	the City of London gets its power from time immemorial, meaning that the city is so old it just is.
73000	77000	And that age brings with it unusual and complicated traditions.
77000	83000	The most notable of these perhaps is that in City of London elections, companies get votes. Quite a lot actually.
83000	89000	About three-fourths of the votes cast in city elections are from companies with the remaining one-fourth from residents.
89000	94000	The way it works is that the bigger a company is, the more votes it gets from the City of London.
94000	99000	The companies then give their votes to select employees who work but do not live within the city,
99000	103000	and it's these employees who do the actual voting at election time.
103000	107000	The result is that the Common Council, the bureaucratic beating heart of the City of London,
107000	113000	has about 20 common councillors elected by residents of the city, and about 80 elected by companies of the city.
113000	121000	The reasoning behind this unusual tradition is that for every one person who lives in the City of London, 43 people commute in every day.
121000	129000	In total, that's 300,000 commuters using city services, and whose employment depends on the City of London being business-friendly.
129000	135000	The man in charge of the Common Council, and who heads the city's government, is the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor of London.
135000	141000	Now, suppose you want to be Lord Mayor. Surely, just as in that other London, all you'll need do is
141000	145000	A. Be a British Commonwealth or EU citizen who has
145000	147000	B. Lived in the city for a year and who
147000	150000	C. Wins the election. Right? No.
150000	154000	In the City of London, that's not nearly enough. Ready for the qualifications list?
154000	159000	Before you can even run for Lord Mayor, you need to have been a Sheriff of the City of London.
159000	162000	But before you can be Sheriff, you need to be an Aldermen.
162000	167000	What's an Aldermen? Well, the City of London is divided into 25 wards,
167000	173000	and each ward elects one Aldermen to represent it on the Court of Aldermen, a subsection of the Common Council.
173000	177000	But before you can run for Aldermen, you need to gain Freeman status.
177000	179000	And who gives out Freeman status?
179000	183000	Why, none other than the very Court of Aldermen you're trying to get elected to,
183000	186000	which might just seem like a conflict of interest.
186000	189000	Luckily, there is another way to get Freeman status.
189000	191000	Join one of the city's guilds.
191000	194000	Sadly, they aren't called guilds, they're called livery companies,
194000	197000	a name which is both more boring and less descriptive,
197000	200000	but the remnants of medieval guilds, many of them are,
200000	203000	and within the city, there are 108 of them to choose from,
203000	207000	including, but not limited to, the apothecaries, the fishmongers, the masons, the mercers,
207000	210000	the scientific instrument makers, the bankers, the shipwrights, the wheelwrights,
210000	212000	the butchers, the bakers, two different candlestick makers,
212000	215000	and the most exciting of all, the chartered accountants.
215000	218000	Many of these guilds, like the Fletcher's, have become charities,
218000	222000	but some are still active, such as the Goldsmiths, who test the quality of British coinage,
222000	226000	and the Hackney carriage drivers, who license taxi drivers.
226000	229000	To join one of these guilds, you'll either need to meet the professional requirements,
229000	234000	or for the charities, like the Haberdashers, you'll need the approval of two existing members.
234000	236000	If you meet none of the livery companies' membership requirements,
236000	241000	but you think you'll be a clever clogs and start your own livery company and grant yourself Freeman's status,
241000	246000	tough luck, because new livery companies need to be approved by, you guessed it, the Court of Aldermen.
246000	250000	But let's assume, one way or another, you get the official Freeman's status certificate.
250000	253000	Now you can finally run for Aldermen of Award,
253000	257000	after the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee also approves of you.
257000	262000	But that small barrier passed, you can win election as Aldermen in either one of the four wards where people live,
262000	265000	or the 21 wards where companies live.
265000	269000	Once on the Court of Aldermen, to continue your path to the mayor's office in Guildhall,
269000	271000	you must now be elected as sheriff.
271000	274000	But this time, it's the members of the livery companies who pick the sheriffs.
274000	279000	So if the livery company members elect you as sheriff, after you have successfully completed your term,
279000	281000	then you can finally run for mayor.
281000	285000	But surprisingly, residents of the City of London don't vote for the mayor.
285000	287000	Our old friends on the Court of Aldermen do.
287000	292000	So in summary, once you get your Freeman's status from either the Court of Aldermen or the livery companies,
292000	296000	and after your ward elects you as Aldermen, and then the livery companies elect you as sheriff,
296000	300000	and after your term as sheriff ends, but while you're still on the Court of Aldermen,
300000	302000	then you can run for mayor.
302000	307000	And assuming the other aldermen select you, you can finally take your place as the Right Honourable,
307000	309000	the Lord Mayor of London.
309000	312000	For one year, with no salary.
312000	316000	And you have to cover your own expenses, which will be quite considerable,
316000	321000	as your new job consists mostly of making hundreds of speeches a year around the world promoting city business.
321000	326000	But you do get that fancy hat, which just might make it all worthwhile.
342000	345000	you
