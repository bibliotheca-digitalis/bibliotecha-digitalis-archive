1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
My very easy method just speeds up naming planets.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,080
Every physics classroom has a solar system line like this.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,520
Or like this.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,320
Sorry, Pluto.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
Looking at the line, which planet is closest to Earth?

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
Venus or Mars?

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
To answer, you need first know that, like many things in school, the line is a lie.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
Planets are not people queuing for coffee, but rather spheroids scattered in space.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,160
Always in motion, not in simple circles either, but in ellipses at untidy angles.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
In the cold, dark expanse, this is the coziest Venus gets to Earth.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
But only about once a year and a half-ish.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,560
Starting close, she orbits far, then comes back.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,440
Needs some space on the other side of the Sun.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
This means when Venus is away, Mars can be the closest to play.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,880
So because of orbits, there isn't one answer to who is the closest.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,280
It's really who is mostly the closest.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
The mostest closest.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,200
When Mars and Venus are both on the other side of the Sun, it leaves little Mercury the closest.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,920
Each of Earth's inner three planet friends are, at one time, the farthest and the closest.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,640
And Mercury, with his smallest orbit, makes him never that far from Earth.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
At least on planetary scales.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,160
Giving the little guy a uniquely close relationship with Terra.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,520
In fact, watching the planet spin, because of his small orbit,

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
Mercury, not Mars or Venus, is the closest planet most of the time.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Looking at the line, that seems impossible.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
But nonetheless, in the way of actual orbits,

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,000
if we keep measuring the distance to all the planets as they spin,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,960
Mercury is Earth's mostest closest neighbor.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Which is delightfully unexpected.

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,440
But wait, if Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth,

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,640
he has to be the mostest closest to Venus as well, right?

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
Because her orbit is smaller than Earth's.

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
And running the numbers, it's true.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,400
Making Earth's special relationship with Mercury less special.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,160
But at least this is one time where the line provides the obvious answer.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Mercury is closest to Venus.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,800
While we're here, who is Mars's mostest closest?

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,360
On his other side is the asteroid belt.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,720
So it should be Earth.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
But maybe it's Venus.

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Maybe the rule is the second closest is the mostest closest.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,080
Watching the results and...

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,320
Oh my Celestia, it's Mercury again.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,160
Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, Venus and Mars.

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
For the same reason each time.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Bigger orbits make farther average distances for longer times.

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
So mercurial Mercury is the constantest companion.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
No, no, it can't be true for Jupiter too.

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,880
Enormous far away Jupiter.

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
But it is!

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,160
Once again, Mercury's small orbit means he never goes as far away

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,880
as the other planets with their bigger orbits.

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,560
Thus, are you ready for this?

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,880
The orbital math that shows Mercury is the mostest closest to Jupiter

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,000
is the same for all the planets and everything that orbits the Sun.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
You too, Pluto.

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,160
For each of the planets, Mercury is the mostest closest.
