00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
My very easy method just speeds up naming planets.

00:03.200 --> 00:06.080
Every physics classroom has a solar system line like this.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.520
Or like this.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.320
Sorry, Pluto.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.440
Looking at the line, which planet is closest to Earth?

00:11.440 --> 00:12.880
Venus or Mars?

00:12.880 --> 00:17.840
To answer, you need first know that, like many things in school, the line is a lie.

00:17.840 --> 00:22.560
Planets are not people queuing for coffee, but rather spheroids scattered in space.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.160
Always in motion, not in simple circles either, but in ellipses at untidy angles.

00:28.160 --> 00:32.640
In the cold, dark expanse, this is the coziest Venus gets to Earth.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.600
But only about once a year and a half-ish.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.560
Starting close, she orbits far, then comes back.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.440
Needs some space on the other side of the Sun.

00:41.440 --> 00:45.120
This means when Venus is away, Mars can be the closest to play.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.880
So because of orbits, there isn't one answer to who is the closest.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.280
It's really who is mostly the closest.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.640
The mostest closest.

00:52.640 --> 00:57.200
When Mars and Venus are both on the other side of the Sun, it leaves little Mercury the closest.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.920
Each of Earth's inner three planet friends are, at one time, the farthest and the closest.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.640
And Mercury, with his smallest orbit, makes him never that far from Earth.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.400
At least on planetary scales.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.160
Giving the little guy a uniquely close relationship with Terra.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.520
In fact, watching the planet spin, because of his small orbit,

01:15.520 --> 01:20.400
Mercury, not Mars or Venus, is the closest planet most of the time.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.400
Looking at the line, that seems impossible.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.040
But nonetheless, in the way of actual orbits,

01:25.040 --> 01:28.000
if we keep measuring the distance to all the planets as they spin,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.960
Mercury is Earth's mostest closest neighbor.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.960
Which is delightfully unexpected.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.440
But wait, if Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth,

01:35.440 --> 01:38.640
he has to be the mostest closest to Venus as well, right?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.960
Because her orbit is smaller than Earth's.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.880
And running the numbers, it's true.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.400
Making Earth's special relationship with Mercury less special.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.160
But at least this is one time where the line provides the obvious answer.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
Mercury is closest to Venus.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.800
While we're here, who is Mars's mostest closest?

01:54.800 --> 01:57.360
On his other side is the asteroid belt.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.720
So it should be Earth.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.320
But maybe it's Venus.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.160
Maybe the rule is the second closest is the mostest closest.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.080
Watching the results and...

02:06.080 --> 02:08.320
Oh my Celestia, it's Mercury again.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.160
Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, Venus and Mars.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.080
For the same reason each time.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.080
Bigger orbits make farther average distances for longer times.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.120
So mercurial Mercury is the constantest companion.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.640
No, no, it can't be true for Jupiter too.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.880
Enormous far away Jupiter.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.680
But it is!

02:27.680 --> 02:32.160
Once again, Mercury's small orbit means he never goes as far away

02:32.160 --> 02:34.880
as the other planets with their bigger orbits.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.560
Thus, are you ready for this?

02:36.560 --> 02:40.880
The orbital math that shows Mercury is the mostest closest to Jupiter

02:40.880 --> 02:46.000
is the same for all the planets and everything that orbits the Sun.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.280
You too, Pluto.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.160
For each of the planets, Mercury is the mostest closest.
