0	3200	My very easy method just speeds up naming planets.
3200	6080	Every physics classroom has a solar system line like this.
6080	7520	Or like this.
7520	8320	Sorry, Pluto.
8320	11440	Looking at the line, which planet is closest to Earth?
11440	12880	Venus or Mars?
12880	17840	To answer, you need first know that, like many things in school, the line is a lie.
17840	22560	Planets are not people queuing for coffee, but rather spheroids scattered in space.
22560	28160	Always in motion, not in simple circles either, but in ellipses at untidy angles.
28160	32640	In the cold, dark expanse, this is the coziest Venus gets to Earth.
32640	35600	But only about once a year and a half-ish.
35600	38560	Starting close, she orbits far, then comes back.
38560	41440	Needs some space on the other side of the Sun.
41440	45120	This means when Venus is away, Mars can be the closest to play.
45120	48880	So because of orbits, there isn't one answer to who is the closest.
48880	51280	It's really who is mostly the closest.
51280	52640	The mostest closest.
52640	57200	When Mars and Venus are both on the other side of the Sun, it leaves little Mercury the closest.
57200	61920	Each of Earth's inner three planet friends are, at one time, the farthest and the closest.
61920	66640	And Mercury, with his smallest orbit, makes him never that far from Earth.
66640	68400	At least on planetary scales.
68400	72160	Giving the little guy a uniquely close relationship with Terra.
72160	75520	In fact, watching the planet spin, because of his small orbit,
75520	80400	Mercury, not Mars or Venus, is the closest planet most of the time.
80400	82400	Looking at the line, that seems impossible.
82400	85040	But nonetheless, in the way of actual orbits,
85040	88000	if we keep measuring the distance to all the planets as they spin,
88000	90960	Mercury is Earth's mostest closest neighbor.
90960	92960	Which is delightfully unexpected.
92960	95440	But wait, if Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth,
95440	98640	he has to be the mostest closest to Venus as well, right?
98640	100960	Because her orbit is smaller than Earth's.
100960	102880	And running the numbers, it's true.
102880	106400	Making Earth's special relationship with Mercury less special.
106400	110160	But at least this is one time where the line provides the obvious answer.
110160	112160	Mercury is closest to Venus.
112160	114800	While we're here, who is Mars's mostest closest?
114800	117360	On his other side is the asteroid belt.
117360	118720	So it should be Earth.
118720	120320	But maybe it's Venus.
120320	124160	Maybe the rule is the second closest is the mostest closest.
124160	126080	Watching the results and...
126080	128320	Oh my Celestia, it's Mercury again.
128320	132160	Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, Venus and Mars.
132160	134080	For the same reason each time.
134080	138080	Bigger orbits make farther average distances for longer times.
138080	141120	So mercurial Mercury is the constantest companion.
141680	144640	No, no, it can't be true for Jupiter too.
144640	146880	Enormous far away Jupiter.
146880	147680	But it is!
147680	152160	Once again, Mercury's small orbit means he never goes as far away
152160	154880	as the other planets with their bigger orbits.
154880	156560	Thus, are you ready for this?
156560	160880	The orbital math that shows Mercury is the mostest closest to Jupiter
160880	166000	is the same for all the planets and everything that orbits the Sun.
166000	167280	You too, Pluto.
167280	172160	For each of the planets, Mercury is the mostest closest.
