0	4000	Welcome to the United Kingdom and a whole lot more explained by me, CGP Grey.
4000	7000	The United Kingdom, England, Great Britain, are these three the same place?
7000	8000	Are they different places?
8000	11000	Do British people secretly laugh at those who use the terms incorrectly?
11000	12000	Who knows the answers to these questions?
12000	14000	I do, and I'm going to tell you right now.
14000	18000	For the lost, this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle.
18000	20000	The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom.
20000	25000	Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but instead is a country of countries.
25000	28000	It contains inside of it four co-equal and sovereign nations.
28000	30000	The first of these is England, shown here in red.
30000	34000	England is often confused with the United Kingdom as a whole because it's the largest and most populous of the nations
34000	36000	and contains the de facto capital city, London.
36000	39000	To the north is Scotland, shown in blue, and to the west is Wales, shown in white.
39000	43000	And, often forgotten even by those who live in the United Kingdom, is Northern Ireland, shown in orange.
43000	45000	Each country has a local term for the population.
45000	49000	While you can call them all British, it's not recommended as the four countries generally don't like each other.
49000	52000	The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh regard the English as slave-driving colonial masters,
52000	57000	no matter that all three have their own devolved parliaments and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true,
57000	61000	and the English generally guard the rest as rural yokels who spend too much time with their sheep.
61000	65000	However, as the four constituent countries don't have their own passports, they are all British citizens, like it or not.
65000	70000	They are British citizens of the United Kingdom, whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
70000	72000	So where's Great Britain hiding? Right here.
72000	74000	The area covered in black is Great Britain.
74000	78000	Unlike England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical rather than a political term.
78000	80000	Great Britain is the largest island among the British Isles.
80000	85000	Within the United Kingdom, the term Great Britain is often used to refer to England, Scotland, and Wales alone
85000	87000	with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland.
87000	91000	This is mostly but not completely true, as all three constituent countries have islands that are not part of Great Britain,
91000	98000	such as the Isle of Wight, part of England, the Welsh Isle of Anglesey, the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands, the Auckland Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde.
98000	100000	The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland.
100000	105000	It's worth noting at this point that Ireland is not a country, like Great Britain is a geographical, not political, term.
105000	110000	The island of Ireland contains on it two countries, Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed, and the Republic of Ireland.
110000	114000	When people say they are Irish, they are referring to the Republic of Ireland, which is a separate country from the United Kingdom,
114000	118000	however, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union,
118000	123000	even though England in particular likes to pretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France,
123000	125000	but that's a story for another time.
125000	128000	To review, the two largest islands in the British Isles are Ireland and Great Britain.
128000	131000	Ireland has on it two countries, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,
131000	134000	while Great Britain mostly contains three, England, Scotland, and Wales.
134000	137000	These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom.
137000	142000	There are still many unanswered questions, such as why, when you travel to Canada, is there British royalty on the money?
142000	144000	To answer this, we need to talk about empire.
144000	150000	You can't have gone to school in the English-speaking world without having learned that the British Empire once banned a fourth world's land and governed nearly a fourth world's people.
150000	153000	While it's easy to remember the parts of the British Empire that broke away violently,
153000	156000	we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed.
156000	158000	These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire,
158000	162000	where they continued to recognize the monarchy as the head of state in exchange for a local autonomous parliament.
162000	164000	To understand how they are connected, we need to talk about the Crown.
164000	168000	Not the physical Crown that sits behind glass in the Tower of London and earns millions of tourist pounds for the UK,
168000	171000	but the Crown is a complicated legal entity best thought of as a one-man corporation.
171000	173000	Who created this corporation? God did.
173000	177000	According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony.
177000	182000	God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement, conveniently delegates his power to an entity called the Crown.
182000	189000	While this used to be the physical Crown in the Tower of London, it evolved over time into a legal corporation soul, able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch.
189000	192000	It's a useful reminder that the United Kingdom is still technically a theocracy,
192000	196000	with the reigning monarch acting as both the head of state and the supreme governor of the official state religion, Anglicanism.
196000	199000	Such are the oddities that arise when dealing with a thousand-year-old monarchy.
200000	201000	Back to Canada and the rest.
201000	207000	The former colonies that gained their independence through diplomacy and continued to recognize the authority of the Crown are known as the Commonwealth Realm.
207000	217000	They are, in decreasing order of population, Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands, Belize, the Bahamas, Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis and Tuvalu.
217000	222000	All are independent nations but still recognize the monarchy as the head of state even though it has little real power within their borders.
222000	227000	There are three further entities that belong to the Crown and these are the Crown Dependencies, the Isle of Men, Jersey and Guernsey.
227000	233000	Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they are not considered independent nations but are granted local autonomy by the Crown and British citizenship by the United Kingdom,
233000	237000	though the UK does reserve the right to overrule the laws of their local assemblies.
237000	239000	Are we done now? Almost, but not quite.
239000	241000	There are still a couple of loose threads, such as this place.
241000	248000	The tiny city of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain, famous for its rock, its monkeys and for causing diplomatic tension between the United Kingdom and Spain.
248000	253000	Or what about the Falkland Islands, which caused so much tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina that they went to war over them.
253000	260000	These places belong in the last group of Crown properties known as British Overseas Territories, but their former name, Crown Colonies, gives away their origin.
260000	262000	They are the last vestiges of the British Empire.
262000	268000	Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they have not become independent nations and continue to rely on the United Kingdom for military and sometimes economic assistance.
268000	271000	Like the Crown Dependencies, everyone born within their borders is a British citizen.
271000	277000	The Crown Colonies are, in decreasing order of population, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands,
277000	287000	Equatoria and Decalia, Anguilla, Saint Helena, the Ascension Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Montserrat, the British Indian Ocean Territory, the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands, the British Antarctic Territory and the Pickern Islands.
287000	292000	For our final Venn diagram, the United Kingdom is a country situated on the British Isles and is part of the Crown which is controlled by the monarchy.
292000	295000	Also part of the Crown and the British Isles are the Crown Dependencies.
295000	303000	The independent nations of the former Empire that still recognize the Crown are the Commonwealth Realm and the non-independent remnants of the former Empire are the British Overseas Territories.
303000	305000	Thank you very much for watching!
