00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello class, your homework assignment, as the US states that you are, was to make your state flag.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,000
A flag to stir pride in your citizens. A flag to stand proud on the American stage.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,900
A tough task, though not too tough with the guidelines I gave you upon which you will be graded.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,400
1. Keep it simple, something a child could draw, even if they need to simplify it again. Good enough.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,800
2. Make it distinct at a distance. A flag is not a poster, it's not wallpaper, it's not a patch, it's not money or anything else looked at up close.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:36,000
No tiny details, it's a flag. It'll be flying from afar, among other flags, and when the wind stops, you still need to be able to spot yours.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
3. Colors or fewer. Unless you really know what you're doing, but if you think you do, you probably don't.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,200
4. Symbols. Have them. Your colors and what you design with them should mean something. It should say something about your citizens.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,700
5. Words on a flag. The ideal number is zero. It's a flag, not a note that you're passing in class. Thank you, I'll take that.

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,900
6. If you violated this rule, I hope you hid those words in a design, because you will be marked down.

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,700
7. And there is one thing you were absolutely forbidden from writing, because a flag is not a name tag.

12
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,500
8. If you wrote your name on your flag, your flag fails as a flag. No exceptions.

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Alright, let's just get a quick look and see how everybody did. Hold up your flags, please.

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Alright, because you're all so internet to keep your attention, you're getting put on a tier list from S to F.

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,100
S for super, F for you guessed it, you failed. And I can see that so many of you did already.

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,700
The F tier is going to be absolutely bursting, so we're going to break it down into a tier list inside a tier list, S to F for the F tier.

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,300
Alright, let's just get the worst out of the way. Kansas, Montana, Wisconsin, Oregon, that's you. I'm sorry, get up here.

18
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,700
You guys and so many of your classmates went with this basic template, seal on blue,

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,700
that all you bluebells, by copying each other, have each made each other so much worse in the distinct-at-a-distance department.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,900
And you four, you started with seals in the center, which is already subpar, but signing that seal, so much sorrier.

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:16,500
And Montana, this kerning, my eyes can only take so much. Wisconsin, unironically, a cheese-based flag would have been better.

22
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:25,100
And, oh, an objection from Oregon. You have a different design on the back, and this is so much better. I'm gonna give it a pass.

23
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
You should just ditch the front of your flag and be all in on the beaver.

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:37,500
Hey, I wouldn't be laughing, California. It's your turn up here now, and I know you think your flag is awesome, but you seem to have scrawled California across it.

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,100
And don't think bragging about the Republic is going to help your grade. I know all about that phase as an independent country that lasted,

26
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:53,100
but what was it again? Oh right, barely three weeks. Rather a shorter time than some other nation-states I could mention.

27
00:02:53,100 --> 00:03:00,700
And about your bear, look at him. Really look, California. That's a scared bear. Why did you draw him that way?

28
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,700
This is A tier, but F tier. Hey, are you crying? There's no crying in flag design. There's just doing better, which you easily can.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Next, Dakota Sisters, you're up, and you've both written your name, so instant fail.

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,100
But north, your seal is at least better drawn, so D tier, F tier, and south.

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,200
You've picked a brighter blue, which is a bit distinct, so I'll put you on tier with your sister.

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,600
But wait, did you write your name on the flag twice? F tier twice then, but suggestion, Dakotas.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:37,000
You both obviously like this spiky design element, so maybe you could do a cool north-south sister states thing with that.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,100
You know, bring some of that Greenland Antarctic energy to the states.

35
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,500
Now, all of you listen up. Today is not the final day of your judgment. Better is always an option.

36
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,200
Take Miss Mississippi. She started with this flag, but recently felt it didn't fit her, and so transitioned to this one.

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,100
Yes, she added words, which I will mark her down for, but they're hidden as hidden words can be.

38
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,300
Then she put her favorite flower in the center, which is a bit too complicated for my liking.

39
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,800
But you know what? This flag symbolically says Miss Magnolia, Mississippi.

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,500
Exactly what a flag needs to do. Solid C.

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,500
And let her serve as a model of achievable improvement for everyone who fails today, especially California.

42
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you, Miss Mississippi. You can sit down now.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Next up, Nebraska. At least you didn't write your name real big on the bottom.

44
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,300
F.D. Vermont. Not terrible for F tier, obviously. Best-looking seal so far, I guess. C tier.

45
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,500
Maine. You wrote your name real big, but in a classy way.

46
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,900
I can't believe you girls are even making me have to compare seal designs so closely.

47
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,300
Uh, F tier, C tier.

48
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,800
Ugh, I'm getting blue-blinded. Can someone help me out here?

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,100
New Mexico. What vexological virtuosity is this?

50
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,300
A design in the center, so simple and sacred of the Zia people,

51
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,600
done with bold colors that match the New Mexican landscape itself.

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
It's enchanting.

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,500
Need I even say the words, New Mexico?

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,200
S tier. Thank you for giving me hope.

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Okay, back to the Bluebells.

56
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,400
New Hampshire. Seal on blue, but you did kinda go all in on the seal, and the ship is pretty good.

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,700
I didn't think I needed a rule to say that a flag is not a painting of other flags,

58
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,600
but here you are with three.

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,900
F.B. Connecticut. Fan of the grapes, huh, kid? Nah, I'm good, thanks.

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,700
Purple is objectively the worst color, but you know what?

61
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,300
You could do something with that, and it would stand out.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,800
In the meantime, F.D. Enjoy your grapes.

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Michigan. Circum spice? I will, and all I see is more boring blue.

64
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,500
F.D. Can anyone do blue but good?

65
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Ah, Alaska. Look at this, ladies.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The northernest state showing off the northernest star in an open blue sky.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,800
And she didn't feel the need to write Alaska across it.

68
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Which must have been pretty tempting, eh, California?

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,900
And even better, the companion constellation of the Big Dipper is but the tail of Ursa Major,

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,100
a great bear in the sky.

71
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,300
The animal most associated with this state and important to the Alaska natives.

72
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,700
How clever, Alaska. I simply must give you the Best Bear award.

73
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,900
This flag is pretty top tier, but...

74
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:19,100
The low contrast design with the sparse stars does make it difficult to differentiate at a distance.

75
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,400
Especially in, say, dark winters.

76
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,800
And it breaks my brain that your official vertical orientation is for the north star to be at the bottom.

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,000
North star, top star!

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,200
Look, this is an amazing patch which I think comes pre-installed on every backpack in Alaska,

79
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
so your citizens obviously love it.

80
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,500
It's a good flag. It's the best bear. Best in B tier.

81
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,600
Oh, sorry, Miss Missouri. I didn't see you've also got a bear.

82
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Two bears? No, wait. There's a bear on the seal the bears are holding?

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
You definitely win most bears, darling.

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,700
And most stars with, wow, 61.

85
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,700
13 for the original 13 states on the American seal,

86
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
which you put inside your seal for seal-ception.

87
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,400
Then 24 stars for your entry as the 24th state twice.

88
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,800
It's very busy, and you put all those bears and stars and words atop a tricolor,

89
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
the most basic of all flag designs.

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,700
But blessed be, you didn't write your name, so I'm passing you.

91
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,000
D tier. Anyone else who didn't write their name?

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Ah, Rhode Island. You wrote Hope, but I'll take it at this point.

93
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,900
This is also quite the square, but I guess you're going all in on the sailing motif

94
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,800
with the anchors and the colors, and it works.

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,900
C tier. On to the Commonwealth Club.

96
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,100
No more hiding in the back. It's your turn.

97
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,300
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At least it's not blue,

98
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,800
and it's sort of simple in comparison, of course.

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,500
F.C. Kentucky, I know you like being in the Commonwealth Club,

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
but you can't write it on your flag.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,300
Well, you can, but you're getting F tier, D tier for that.

102
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,400
Pennsylvania. If you're gonna do Seal on Blue, this is pretty good.

103
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
And you didn't write Commonwealth of Pennsylvania anywhere.

104
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
F tier, B tier.

105
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,100
And come on up, Captain of the Club, Commonwealth of Virginia.

106
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Let's see what you've done.

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,400
Oh god, are you trying to get me demonetized?

108
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Your flag has nudity, murder, and an explicit call to violence.

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,700
But you know what, Virginia? That's kind of badass.

110
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,200
F.B.

111
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, hi Ohio. Another oddly shaped flag.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
You know this is more of a cape than a flag, right?

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,900
Right, you do.

114
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,600
Well, it's very much America.

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm gonna give it a B.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Next up, Delaware.

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,900
Delaware.

118
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,200
Fully writing out the date on the bottom is just such a bottom tier move.

119
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
I know you're the forgotten state,

120
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,600
and you want to emphasize that you're really the first,

121
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,300
but there's gotta be a better way.

122
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,900
F.F.

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,700
Wyoming.

124
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,500
Let me tell you something, Wyoming.

125
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,200
Let me tell you what I foresee as the final chapter of my life.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,700
When age or end times come, when my work is finished and forgotten,

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,000
I will travel to your great state to find a plot of land,

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,700
one with a cozy cabin, a porch out front,

129
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,800
where pet buffalo by my side, shotgun across my lap.

130
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,600
I will watch the sun set for however many days are left.

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,700
For me, for us all.

132
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,300
And in the sky above this scene, I will fly this flag of forever west with pride.

133
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:14,600
But I will have to get it custom printed to remove this terrible, needless seal you've stamped in the center.

134
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,200
A seal upon which you have written your name.

135
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,300
It's so close to epic.

136
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,000
But for now, I must, by my own unbreakable rule, give it an F.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
But S-tier F, obviously.

138
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,300
Now, who's going to be next?

139
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,400
All the I's.

140
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Europe.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,700
Starting with Idaho.

142
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,600
You wrote your name twice.

143
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I can't even right now.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,400
F.F.

145
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Iowa.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You've got your name too.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,300
And a whole sentence of instruction.

148
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Have you won the most words award?

149
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,800
Oh no, not even close.

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Idaho beat you for 12 to tie with Nebraska, to be beaten by Wyoming for 13.

151
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,200
And first place goes to South Dakota.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
17 words.

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,300
But that doesn't make this any less bad, Iowa.

154
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,000
And you also wrote your name.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
F-tier, obviously.

156
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,900
But at least it's much merica.

157
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,200
So F-tier, A-tier.

158
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,900
Indiana.

159
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,400
Oh, what a relief, Indiana.

160
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,100
Pretty good.

161
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,800
Colors are similar to Alaska, but with more stars.

162
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
It's more identifiable at a distance.

163
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,000
And you've done your own thing with the torch of liberty.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
It's pretty good.

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm going to give it an what are you doing?

166
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
F-tier, A-tier.

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Sit down.

168
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Last of the eyes.

169
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Illinois.

170
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
You've also gone with an eagle, but it is not very good.

171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,800
And your backwards sovereignty on the scroll points for realism, I guess.

173
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
But a flag is not a painting.

174
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
And you added the date of this design?

175
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Why?

176
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Oh, this is literally just the seal of Illinois on a white background written above the word

177
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Illinois.

178
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
It's terrible.

179
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
F-tier, F-tier.

180
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Colorado.

181
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Colorado.

182
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I feel like you're really trying to push my boundaries here, Colorado.

183
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
The design is simple while still standing out.

184
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,800
And I'd give it a B, but this giant C, it's a little on the nose.

185
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Don't you think, Colorado?

186
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
And you know what else it is?

187
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
It's writing.

188
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Writing on a flag.

189
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
C for C-tier.

190
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
And don't point to Ohio.

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
She did it better.

192
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Most people didn't even notice the O.

193
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Next, Minnesota.

194
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Terrible.

195
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Oof, this is just terrible.

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Your name isn't as big and bad as the other bluebells, but the busyness is bottom-tier

197
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
bad.

198
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,720
Wisconsin, I was too harsh on you before.

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,960
This is the worst flag in the union.

200
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Come on, Minnesota.

201
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,800
You're America's blonde scion of Scandinavia.

202
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,180
A classic flag designs itself.

203
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
But this?

204
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,040
I need a visual palette cleanser now.

205
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Ah, Alabama.

206
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,840
Can't go wrong with a simple shape, identifiable at a distance, vertical perfection, and a

207
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,800
lesson to everyone.

208
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,660
So much more can be done with so much less.

209
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,040
This flag would fit in on the international stage.

210
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,540
A for Alabama.

211
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,080
State of West Virginia, home of hearty Appalachia.

212
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,620
You deserve better than this.

213
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
FD.

214
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
Arkansas.

215
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
You know what, Arkansas?

216
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,900
Even with writing your name real big across the center, I think you've made it kind

217
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
of work.

218
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,100
I can't pass you, obviously, but it's very America, and diamonds are your thing.

219
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm gonna give it F-tier, A-tier.

220
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,980
And speaking of words that work, get up here, Nevada.

221
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,580
Now obviously, this flag is bad and boring, which is a crime because you get the award

222
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,860
for the two best words ever written on a flag.

223
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,900
Battle born.

224
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,700
Battle born.

225
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,820
It's awesome.

226
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,140
And unlike some other states trying to big up their history that we won't mention, you

227
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,700
really did become a state for the union in the middle of America's bloodiest war.

228
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,060
I can't believe I'm going to say this, but if two words ever deserve to be put in

229
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,340
impact font on a flag, battle born are those words.

230
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Do it, Nevada.

231
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
Do it, do it, do it.

232
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Maryland.

233
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,460
Oh, my.

234
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,280
It's hideous.

235
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,840
So hideous, it falls right off the bottom to land back on the top.

236
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
S-tier, Maryland.

237
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,720
I don't care what anyone says, wear it with pride.

238
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Louisiana.

239
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,260
That pelican is vulning herself, which is a heraldic term meaning to injure herself,

240
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,560
making you the only flag to show actual blood.

241
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,760
I must remind you that a flag is not heraldry, but at least it's unique.

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
FB.

243
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Tennessee.

244
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,720
I think people underrate your flag, Tennessee, partly because of this blue bar on the side,

245
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,080
which seems a bit random when looked at on a screen, but was added to keep it distinct

246
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,240
when flying with or without wind, which totally works.

247
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,540
And your three stars are for the three grand divisions of your rather rectangular state

248
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,740
unified.

249
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
This flag?

250
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,840
On screen it's a B, but in the air it's an A.

251
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Washington.

252
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Washington.

253
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:30,820
A flag is not money, Washington, and this is real extra awkward because DC, who isn't

254
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,640
even in this class, absolutely wrecked you with this A-tier flag that represents Washington

255
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:44,100
so much better by adapting his family coat of arms, not drawing his facey face.

256
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,980
But at least it's money green so it stands out from the blues.

257
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
FC.

258
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Hawaii.

259
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,220
I have complicated feelings about this flag, Hawaii.

260
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,780
It's ugly, but in a bit of the magnificent Maryland way.

261
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,420
The eight stripes for the eight islands don't align at all with the Union Jack, which is

262
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,940
also historically confused as you were never part of the British Empire.

263
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,260
You instead just took their flag to use for your kingdom as your own, which is a pretty

264
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
bold move.

265
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,220
Well, you didn't write Kingdom of Hawaii across it and you love your rainbows, and if an American

266
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,140
flag was a rainbow, this would be that flag.

267
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm going to give it a B.

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Oklahoma.

269
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,940
Ah, you're another real heartbreaker here, kid.

270
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,940
We're just going to ignore this for now and look at this, which is not a seal, but a buffalo

271
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,300
skin shield of the Osea nation.

272
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,360
Much cooler, and with a pipe of the plains American Indians crossed with the olive branch

273
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,540
for Europeans who were becoming Americans, you've done by far the best job of symbolically

274
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,540
trying to address something very American that other flags struggled with.

275
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,540
Minnesota.

276
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,140
I'm giving it an FC because there's something here that could be even epicker.

277
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,140
Carolina Sisters.

278
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,180
South first.

279
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,500
It's a bit disjointed, and I know you love the Palmetto, but everyone thinks this is

280
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,540
a palm tree, and it's weird because you have the angel oak, one of the most famous and

281
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,240
beautiful trees in the world, which could make a much better design, and then there

282
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,120
would be zero chance of people confusing you for California.

283
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,820
But unlike California, you didn't write your name, so you pass, but this complicated plant

284
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,020
in the center, it's just not as good as Miss Mississippi's.

285
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
D-tier.

286
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
North next.

287
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,420
Now, I'm totally biased toward my adoptive state, and when I see this flag flying around

288
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,820
Raleigh, it provokes in me pride of Old North, even if it does look a bit too much like someone

289
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,820
else's flag.

290
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,700
But if I'm trying to be consistent, I can't give a flag with not just letters but entire

291
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,580
words more than C-tier.

292
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,300
I don't think either of you need a redesign desperately, so many others are ahead of you

293
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,180
on that line, but perhaps you sisters could, like the Dakotas, consider a Carolinian combo

294
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,320
for the future.

295
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Could be cool.

296
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Next, New Jersey.

297
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,140
That color is a real choice, but you know what, at least it stands out and your seal

298
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
isn't awful.

299
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
F-tier B-tier.

300
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Arizona.

301
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
A-tier?

302
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Awesome, Arizona.

303
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,140
You've got a red and yellow sunset that looks like your state and is also a nod to the Spanish

304
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
settlers.

305
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,100
I know some don't like the copper star, but they are wrong, because you're the Copper

306
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Queen.

307
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,700
And it also makes me think of Sheriffs of the Wild West.

308
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,740
Did I already say A-tier Arizona?

309
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
A-tier Arizona.

310
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,580
Now for New York.

311
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,320
New York.

312
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
New York.

313
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,540
I'm a native son of your great state, so it hurts me when I say, of all the flags, yours

314
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,020
is my biggest disappointment.

315
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,300
Sure, your seal is better than most.

316
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
F-tier, C-tier.

317
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Whatever.

318
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,820
But you are the Empire State, daughter of actual empire.

319
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,820
If you aspire to that awesome moniker, how do you think your flag compares to, say, this?

320
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,100
Let's just visit London real quick, and here you'll see Union Jacks for sale everywhere.

321
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,580
Union Jacks used everywhere, because UK did S-tier work back in London's sister city

322
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,780
of New York.

323
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,980
Can you even find a state flag?

324
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:57,500
And are you really going to let New Jersey have a more identifiable flag than you?

325
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,140
New Jersey?

326
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,300
Excelsior to S-tier New York.

327
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,620
Now get out of here.

328
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Georgia.

329
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,260
I feel like it almost kind of works with the seal in the corner, but ultimately doesn't.

330
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,000
And it's a little bit too much like North Carolina, which is a little bit too much like

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
somebody else.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,260
You didn't write your name, but you did write a lot of words.

333
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
D-tier.

334
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,740
Alright, enough foreshadowing.

335
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,320
Get up here, Texas.

336
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,900
You already know this is an A-tier flag.

337
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,220
I don't need to tell you that.

338
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,280
But you've also done just so much work with state pride.

339
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,100
You and your citizens love and use this flag like you're still the Republic of Texas.

340
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,740
And you're getting the bonus points you deserve for it.

341
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Florida.

342
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,460
Did you... did you just copy Alabama's flag but make it worse, and you wrote your name

343
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
on it?

344
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,380
F-tier, but A-tier only because you're copying a good design.

345
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,060
Please try again on your own this time.

346
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,180
And last up, it's you, Utah.

347
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,660
Oh, I see you have a last-minute redesign in hand.

348
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,060
Which is it gonna be?

349
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,380
You have chosen wisely.

350
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,340
This is a great and meaningful flag.

351
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,840
The symbol for the industry of your people, atop their state star in the nation, built

352
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,400
on your red rocks before the white peaks and under the blue sky.

353
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,660
It's A-tier.

354
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,060
Class, the most important part of any assignment is not just knowing the rules written out,

355
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,360
but what is inside the heart of he who is giving the grave.

356
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,860
This flag, with B's and best-of-gons, for me, it can't be but S-tier.

357
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,500
Class dismissed.

358
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,720
you
