00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Hello class, your homework assignment, as the US states that you are, was to make your state flag.

00:05.600 --> 00:11.000
A flag to stir pride in your citizens. A flag to stand proud on the American stage.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.900
A tough task, though not too tough with the guidelines I gave you upon which you will be graded.

00:15.900 --> 00:20.400
1. Keep it simple, something a child could draw, even if they need to simplify it again. Good enough.

00:20.400 --> 00:27.800
2. Make it distinct at a distance. A flag is not a poster, it's not wallpaper, it's not a patch, it's not money or anything else looked at up close.

00:27.800 --> 00:36.000
No tiny details, it's a flag. It'll be flying from afar, among other flags, and when the wind stops, you still need to be able to spot yours.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
3. Colors or fewer. Unless you really know what you're doing, but if you think you do, you probably don't.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.200
4. Symbols. Have them. Your colors and what you design with them should mean something. It should say something about your citizens.

00:49.200 --> 00:57.700
5. Words on a flag. The ideal number is zero. It's a flag, not a note that you're passing in class. Thank you, I'll take that.

00:57.700 --> 01:02.900
6. If you violated this rule, I hope you hid those words in a design, because you will be marked down.

01:02.900 --> 01:09.700
7. And there is one thing you were absolutely forbidden from writing, because a flag is not a name tag.

01:09.700 --> 01:15.500
8. If you wrote your name on your flag, your flag fails as a flag. No exceptions.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.500
Alright, let's just get a quick look and see how everybody did. Hold up your flags, please.

01:20.500 --> 01:28.700
Alright, because you're all so internet to keep your attention, you're getting put on a tier list from S to F.

01:28.700 --> 01:35.100
S for super, F for you guessed it, you failed. And I can see that so many of you did already.

01:35.100 --> 01:43.700
The F tier is going to be absolutely bursting, so we're going to break it down into a tier list inside a tier list, S to F for the F tier.

01:43.700 --> 01:49.300
Alright, let's just get the worst out of the way. Kansas, Montana, Wisconsin, Oregon, that's you. I'm sorry, get up here.

01:49.300 --> 01:54.700
You guys and so many of your classmates went with this basic template, seal on blue,

01:54.700 --> 02:01.700
that all you bluebells, by copying each other, have each made each other so much worse in the distinct-at-a-distance department.

02:01.700 --> 02:08.900
And you four, you started with seals in the center, which is already subpar, but signing that seal, so much sorrier.

02:08.900 --> 02:16.500
And Montana, this kerning, my eyes can only take so much. Wisconsin, unironically, a cheese-based flag would have been better.

02:17.100 --> 02:25.100
And, oh, an objection from Oregon. You have a different design on the back, and this is so much better. I'm gonna give it a pass.

02:25.100 --> 02:28.300
You should just ditch the front of your flag and be all in on the beaver.

02:28.300 --> 02:37.500
Hey, I wouldn't be laughing, California. It's your turn up here now, and I know you think your flag is awesome, but you seem to have scrawled California across it.

02:37.500 --> 02:45.100
And don't think bragging about the Republic is going to help your grade. I know all about that phase as an independent country that lasted,

02:45.100 --> 02:53.100
but what was it again? Oh right, barely three weeks. Rather a shorter time than some other nation-states I could mention.

02:53.100 --> 03:00.700
And about your bear, look at him. Really look, California. That's a scared bear. Why did you draw him that way?

03:00.700 --> 03:08.700
This is A tier, but F tier. Hey, are you crying? There's no crying in flag design. There's just doing better, which you easily can.

03:08.800 --> 03:14.800
Next, Dakota Sisters, you're up, and you've both written your name, so instant fail.

03:14.800 --> 03:20.100
But north, your seal is at least better drawn, so D tier, F tier, and south.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.200
You've picked a brighter blue, which is a bit distinct, so I'll put you on tier with your sister.

03:24.200 --> 03:30.600
But wait, did you write your name on the flag twice? F tier twice then, but suggestion, Dakotas.

03:30.600 --> 03:37.000
You both obviously like this spiky design element, so maybe you could do a cool north-south sister states thing with that.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.100
You know, bring some of that Greenland Antarctic energy to the states.

03:40.100 --> 03:46.500
Now, all of you listen up. Today is not the final day of your judgment. Better is always an option.

03:46.500 --> 03:53.200
Take Miss Mississippi. She started with this flag, but recently felt it didn't fit her, and so transitioned to this one.

03:53.200 --> 03:58.100
Yes, she added words, which I will mark her down for, but they're hidden as hidden words can be.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.300
Then she put her favorite flower in the center, which is a bit too complicated for my liking.

04:02.300 --> 04:06.800
But you know what? This flag symbolically says Miss Magnolia, Mississippi.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.500
Exactly what a flag needs to do. Solid C.

04:10.500 --> 04:17.500
And let her serve as a model of achievable improvement for everyone who fails today, especially California.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.000
Thank you, Miss Mississippi. You can sit down now.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.200
Next up, Nebraska. At least you didn't write your name real big on the bottom.

04:23.200 --> 04:28.300
F.D. Vermont. Not terrible for F tier, obviously. Best-looking seal so far, I guess. C tier.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.500
Maine. You wrote your name real big, but in a classy way.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.900
I can't believe you girls are even making me have to compare seal designs so closely.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.300
Uh, F tier, C tier.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.800
Ugh, I'm getting blue-blinded. Can someone help me out here?

04:39.800 --> 04:44.100
New Mexico. What vexological virtuosity is this?

04:44.100 --> 04:48.300
A design in the center, so simple and sacred of the Zia people,

04:48.300 --> 04:52.600
done with bold colors that match the New Mexican landscape itself.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.400
It's enchanting.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.500
Need I even say the words, New Mexico?

04:57.500 --> 05:00.200
S tier. Thank you for giving me hope.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.300
Okay, back to the Bluebells.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.400
New Hampshire. Seal on blue, but you did kinda go all in on the seal, and the ship is pretty good.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.700
I didn't think I needed a rule to say that a flag is not a painting of other flags,

05:10.700 --> 05:12.600
but here you are with three.

05:12.600 --> 05:17.900
F.B. Connecticut. Fan of the grapes, huh, kid? Nah, I'm good, thanks.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.700
Purple is objectively the worst color, but you know what?

05:20.700 --> 05:23.300
You could do something with that, and it would stand out.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.800
In the meantime, F.D. Enjoy your grapes.

05:25.800 --> 05:31.400
Michigan. Circum spice? I will, and all I see is more boring blue.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.500
F.D. Can anyone do blue but good?

05:34.500 --> 05:38.000
Ah, Alaska. Look at this, ladies.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
The northernest state showing off the northernest star in an open blue sky.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.800
And she didn't feel the need to write Alaska across it.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.600
Which must have been pretty tempting, eh, California?

05:50.600 --> 05:56.900
And even better, the companion constellation of the Big Dipper is but the tail of Ursa Major,

05:56.900 --> 05:59.100
a great bear in the sky.

05:59.100 --> 06:04.300
The animal most associated with this state and important to the Alaska natives.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.700
How clever, Alaska. I simply must give you the Best Bear award.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.900
This flag is pretty top tier, but...

06:11.900 --> 06:19.100
The low contrast design with the sparse stars does make it difficult to differentiate at a distance.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.400
Especially in, say, dark winters.

06:21.400 --> 06:27.800
And it breaks my brain that your official vertical orientation is for the north star to be at the bottom.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.000
North star, top star!

06:29.000 --> 06:35.200
Look, this is an amazing patch which I think comes pre-installed on every backpack in Alaska,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.400
so your citizens obviously love it.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.500
It's a good flag. It's the best bear. Best in B tier.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.600
Oh, sorry, Miss Missouri. I didn't see you've also got a bear.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.000
Two bears? No, wait. There's a bear on the seal the bears are holding?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.600
You definitely win most bears, darling.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.700
And most stars with, wow, 61.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.700
13 for the original 13 states on the American seal,

06:58.700 --> 07:01.700
which you put inside your seal for seal-ception.

07:01.700 --> 07:06.400
Then 24 stars for your entry as the 24th state twice.

07:06.400 --> 07:11.800
It's very busy, and you put all those bears and stars and words atop a tricolor,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.900
the most basic of all flag designs.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.700
But blessed be, you didn't write your name, so I'm passing you.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.000
D tier. Anyone else who didn't write their name?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.500
Ah, Rhode Island. You wrote Hope, but I'll take it at this point.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.900
This is also quite the square, but I guess you're going all in on the sailing motif

07:27.900 --> 07:30.800
with the anchors and the colors, and it works.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.900
C tier. On to the Commonwealth Club.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.100
No more hiding in the back. It's your turn.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.300
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At least it's not blue,

07:38.300 --> 07:40.800
and it's sort of simple in comparison, of course.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.500
F.C. Kentucky, I know you like being in the Commonwealth Club,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.000
but you can't write it on your flag.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.300
Well, you can, but you're getting F tier, D tier for that.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.400
Pennsylvania. If you're gonna do Seal on Blue, this is pretty good.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.500
And you didn't write Commonwealth of Pennsylvania anywhere.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.900
F tier, B tier.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.100
And come on up, Captain of the Club, Commonwealth of Virginia.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.100
Let's see what you've done.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.400
Oh god, are you trying to get me demonetized?

08:01.400 --> 08:06.600
Your flag has nudity, murder, and an explicit call to violence.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.700
But you know what, Virginia? That's kind of badass.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.200
F.B.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.000
Oh, hi Ohio. Another oddly shaped flag.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.200
You know this is more of a cape than a flag, right?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.900
Right, you do.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.600
Well, it's very much America.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.000
I'm gonna give it a B.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Next up, Delaware.

08:23.000 --> 08:23.900
Delaware.

08:23.900 --> 08:28.200
Fully writing out the date on the bottom is just such a bottom tier move.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.400
I know you're the forgotten state,

08:29.400 --> 08:31.600
and you want to emphasize that you're really the first,

08:31.600 --> 08:33.300
but there's gotta be a better way.

08:33.300 --> 08:33.900
F.F.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.700
Wyoming.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.500
Let me tell you something, Wyoming.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.200
Let me tell you what I foresee as the final chapter of my life.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.700
When age or end times come, when my work is finished and forgotten,

08:45.700 --> 08:49.000
I will travel to your great state to find a plot of land,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.700
one with a cozy cabin, a porch out front,

08:51.700 --> 08:55.800
where pet buffalo by my side, shotgun across my lap.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.600
I will watch the sun set for however many days are left.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.700
For me, for us all.

09:01.700 --> 09:07.300
And in the sky above this scene, I will fly this flag of forever west with pride.

09:07.300 --> 09:14.600
But I will have to get it custom printed to remove this terrible, needless seal you've stamped in the center.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.200
A seal upon which you have written your name.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.300
It's so close to epic.

09:19.300 --> 09:25.000
But for now, I must, by my own unbreakable rule, give it an F.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.600
But S-tier F, obviously.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.300
Now, who's going to be next?

09:29.300 --> 09:30.400
All the I's.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.000
Europe.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.700
Starting with Idaho.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.600
You wrote your name twice.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600
I can't even right now.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.400
F.F.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.000
Iowa.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
You've got your name too.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.300
And a whole sentence of instruction.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.300
Have you won the most words award?

09:41.300 --> 09:42.800
Oh no, not even close.

09:42.800 --> 09:47.600
Idaho beat you for 12 to tie with Nebraska, to be beaten by Wyoming for 13.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.200
And first place goes to South Dakota.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.600
17 words.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.300
But that doesn't make this any less bad, Iowa.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.000
And you also wrote your name.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.200
F-tier, obviously.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.900
But at least it's much merica.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.200
So F-tier, A-tier.

09:59.200 --> 09:59.900
Indiana.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.400
Oh, what a relief, Indiana.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.100
Pretty good.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.800
Colors are similar to Alaska, but with more stars.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.600
It's more identifiable at a distance.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.000
And you've done your own thing with the torch of liberty.

10:09.000 --> 10:09.800
It's pretty good.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.200
I'm going to give it an what are you doing?

10:13.800 --> 10:14.800
F-tier, A-tier.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
Sit down.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Last of the eyes.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.800
Illinois.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.800
You've also gone with an eagle, but it is not very good.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.800
I'm sorry.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.800
And your backwards sovereignty on the scroll points for realism, I guess.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
But a flag is not a painting.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.800
And you added the date of this design?

10:29.800 --> 10:30.800
Why?

10:30.800 --> 10:35.800
Oh, this is literally just the seal of Illinois on a white background written above the word

10:35.800 --> 10:36.800
Illinois.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.800
It's terrible.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
F-tier, F-tier.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.800
Colorado.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
Colorado.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.800
I feel like you're really trying to push my boundaries here, Colorado.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.800
The design is simple while still standing out.

10:45.800 --> 10:50.800
And I'd give it a B, but this giant C, it's a little on the nose.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.800
Don't you think, Colorado?

10:52.800 --> 10:53.800
And you know what else it is?

10:53.800 --> 10:54.800
It's writing.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
Writing on a flag.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
C for C-tier.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.800
And don't point to Ohio.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.800
She did it better.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
Most people didn't even notice the O.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.800
Next, Minnesota.

11:01.800 --> 11:02.800
Terrible.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.800
Oof, this is just terrible.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.800
Your name isn't as big and bad as the other bluebells, but the busyness is bottom-tier

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
bad.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.720
Wisconsin, I was too harsh on you before.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.960
This is the worst flag in the union.

11:13.960 --> 11:14.960
Come on, Minnesota.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.800
You're America's blonde scion of Scandinavia.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.180
A classic flag designs itself.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.180
But this?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.040
I need a visual palette cleanser now.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.880
Ah, Alabama.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.840
Can't go wrong with a simple shape, identifiable at a distance, vertical perfection, and a

11:28.840 --> 11:30.800
lesson to everyone.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.660
So much more can be done with so much less.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.040
This flag would fit in on the international stage.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.540
A for Alabama.

11:37.540 --> 11:40.080
State of West Virginia, home of hearty Appalachia.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.620
You deserve better than this.

11:41.620 --> 11:42.620
FD.

11:42.620 --> 11:43.620
Arkansas.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.620
You know what, Arkansas?

11:44.620 --> 11:48.900
Even with writing your name real big across the center, I think you've made it kind

11:48.900 --> 11:49.900
of work.

11:49.900 --> 11:54.100
I can't pass you, obviously, but it's very America, and diamonds are your thing.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.120
I'm gonna give it F-tier, A-tier.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.980
And speaking of words that work, get up here, Nevada.

11:58.980 --> 12:03.580
Now obviously, this flag is bad and boring, which is a crime because you get the award

12:03.580 --> 12:06.860
for the two best words ever written on a flag.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.900
Battle born.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.700
Battle born.

12:10.700 --> 12:11.820
It's awesome.

12:11.820 --> 12:15.140
And unlike some other states trying to big up their history that we won't mention, you

12:15.140 --> 12:19.700
really did become a state for the union in the middle of America's bloodiest war.

12:19.700 --> 12:24.060
I can't believe I'm going to say this, but if two words ever deserve to be put in

12:24.060 --> 12:28.340
impact font on a flag, battle born are those words.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.340
Do it, Nevada.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.340
Do it, do it, do it.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.340
Maryland.

12:31.340 --> 12:32.460
Oh, my.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.280
It's hideous.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.840
So hideous, it falls right off the bottom to land back on the top.

12:38.840 --> 12:39.840
S-tier, Maryland.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.720
I don't care what anyone says, wear it with pride.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.720
Louisiana.

12:43.720 --> 12:50.260
That pelican is vulning herself, which is a heraldic term meaning to injure herself,

12:50.260 --> 12:53.560
making you the only flag to show actual blood.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.760
I must remind you that a flag is not heraldry, but at least it's unique.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
FB.

12:58.760 --> 12:59.760
Tennessee.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.720
I think people underrate your flag, Tennessee, partly because of this blue bar on the side,

13:03.720 --> 13:08.080
which seems a bit random when looked at on a screen, but was added to keep it distinct

13:08.080 --> 13:11.240
when flying with or without wind, which totally works.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.540
And your three stars are for the three grand divisions of your rather rectangular state

13:15.540 --> 13:16.740
unified.

13:16.740 --> 13:17.740
This flag?

13:17.740 --> 13:20.840
On screen it's a B, but in the air it's an A.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.840
Washington.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
Washington.

13:22.840 --> 13:30.820
A flag is not money, Washington, and this is real extra awkward because DC, who isn't

13:30.820 --> 13:37.640
even in this class, absolutely wrecked you with this A-tier flag that represents Washington

13:37.640 --> 13:44.100
so much better by adapting his family coat of arms, not drawing his facey face.

13:44.100 --> 13:47.980
But at least it's money green so it stands out from the blues.

13:47.980 --> 13:48.980
FC.

13:48.980 --> 13:49.980
Hawaii.

13:49.980 --> 13:52.220
I have complicated feelings about this flag, Hawaii.

13:52.220 --> 13:55.780
It's ugly, but in a bit of the magnificent Maryland way.

13:55.780 --> 13:59.420
The eight stripes for the eight islands don't align at all with the Union Jack, which is

13:59.420 --> 14:02.940
also historically confused as you were never part of the British Empire.

14:02.940 --> 14:07.260
You instead just took their flag to use for your kingdom as your own, which is a pretty

14:07.260 --> 14:08.260
bold move.

14:08.260 --> 14:13.220
Well, you didn't write Kingdom of Hawaii across it and you love your rainbows, and if an American

14:13.220 --> 14:16.140
flag was a rainbow, this would be that flag.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.700
I'm going to give it a B.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.700
Oklahoma.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.940
Ah, you're another real heartbreaker here, kid.

14:20.940 --> 14:25.940
We're just going to ignore this for now and look at this, which is not a seal, but a buffalo

14:25.940 --> 14:28.300
skin shield of the Osea nation.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.360
Much cooler, and with a pipe of the plains American Indians crossed with the olive branch

14:32.360 --> 14:37.540
for Europeans who were becoming Americans, you've done by far the best job of symbolically

14:37.540 --> 14:42.540
trying to address something very American that other flags struggled with.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.540
Minnesota.

14:43.540 --> 14:47.140
I'm giving it an FC because there's something here that could be even epicker.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.140
Carolina Sisters.

14:48.140 --> 14:49.180
South first.

14:49.180 --> 14:53.500
It's a bit disjointed, and I know you love the Palmetto, but everyone thinks this is

14:53.500 --> 14:58.540
a palm tree, and it's weird because you have the angel oak, one of the most famous and

14:58.540 --> 15:02.240
beautiful trees in the world, which could make a much better design, and then there

15:02.240 --> 15:06.120
would be zero chance of people confusing you for California.

15:06.120 --> 15:10.820
But unlike California, you didn't write your name, so you pass, but this complicated plant

15:10.820 --> 15:14.020
in the center, it's just not as good as Miss Mississippi's.

15:14.020 --> 15:15.020
D-tier.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.020
North next.

15:16.020 --> 15:20.420
Now, I'm totally biased toward my adoptive state, and when I see this flag flying around

15:20.420 --> 15:24.820
Raleigh, it provokes in me pride of Old North, even if it does look a bit too much like someone

15:24.820 --> 15:25.820
else's flag.

15:25.820 --> 15:30.700
But if I'm trying to be consistent, I can't give a flag with not just letters but entire

15:30.700 --> 15:32.580
words more than C-tier.

15:32.580 --> 15:36.300
I don't think either of you need a redesign desperately, so many others are ahead of you

15:36.300 --> 15:41.180
on that line, but perhaps you sisters could, like the Dakotas, consider a Carolinian combo

15:41.180 --> 15:42.320
for the future.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.320
Could be cool.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.320
Next, New Jersey.

15:44.320 --> 15:48.140
That color is a real choice, but you know what, at least it stands out and your seal

15:48.140 --> 15:49.140
isn't awful.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.140
F-tier B-tier.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.140
Arizona.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.140
A-tier?

15:52.140 --> 15:53.140
Awesome, Arizona.

15:53.140 --> 15:57.140
You've got a red and yellow sunset that looks like your state and is also a nod to the Spanish

15:57.140 --> 15:58.140
settlers.

15:58.140 --> 16:01.100
I know some don't like the copper star, but they are wrong, because you're the Copper

16:01.100 --> 16:02.100
Queen.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.700
And it also makes me think of Sheriffs of the Wild West.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.740
Did I already say A-tier Arizona?

16:05.740 --> 16:06.740
A-tier Arizona.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.580
Now for New York.

16:08.580 --> 16:10.320
New York.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.320
New York.

16:11.320 --> 16:17.540
I'm a native son of your great state, so it hurts me when I say, of all the flags, yours

16:17.540 --> 16:19.020
is my biggest disappointment.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.300
Sure, your seal is better than most.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.300
F-tier, C-tier.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.300
Whatever.

16:23.300 --> 16:27.820
But you are the Empire State, daughter of actual empire.

16:27.820 --> 16:33.820
If you aspire to that awesome moniker, how do you think your flag compares to, say, this?

16:33.820 --> 16:40.100
Let's just visit London real quick, and here you'll see Union Jacks for sale everywhere.

16:40.100 --> 16:46.580
Union Jacks used everywhere, because UK did S-tier work back in London's sister city

16:46.580 --> 16:47.780
of New York.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.980
Can you even find a state flag?

16:50.980 --> 16:57.500
And are you really going to let New Jersey have a more identifiable flag than you?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.140
New Jersey?

16:59.140 --> 17:01.300
Excelsior to S-tier New York.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.620
Now get out of here.

17:02.620 --> 17:03.620
Georgia.

17:03.620 --> 17:08.260
I feel like it almost kind of works with the seal in the corner, but ultimately doesn't.

17:08.260 --> 17:12.000
And it's a little bit too much like North Carolina, which is a little bit too much like

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
somebody else.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.260
You didn't write your name, but you did write a lot of words.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.260
D-tier.

17:16.260 --> 17:18.740
Alright, enough foreshadowing.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.320
Get up here, Texas.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.900
You already know this is an A-tier flag.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.220
I don't need to tell you that.

17:24.220 --> 17:28.280
But you've also done just so much work with state pride.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.100
You and your citizens love and use this flag like you're still the Republic of Texas.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.740
And you're getting the bonus points you deserve for it.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.740
Florida.

17:37.740 --> 17:44.460
Did you... did you just copy Alabama's flag but make it worse, and you wrote your name

17:44.460 --> 17:45.460
on it?

17:45.660 --> 17:49.380
F-tier, but A-tier only because you're copying a good design.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.060
Please try again on your own this time.

17:52.060 --> 17:54.180
And last up, it's you, Utah.

17:54.180 --> 17:57.660
Oh, I see you have a last-minute redesign in hand.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.060
Which is it gonna be?

17:59.060 --> 18:01.380
You have chosen wisely.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.340
This is a great and meaningful flag.

18:04.340 --> 18:08.840
The symbol for the industry of your people, atop their state star in the nation, built

18:08.840 --> 18:13.400
on your red rocks before the white peaks and under the blue sky.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.660
It's A-tier.

18:14.660 --> 18:20.060
Class, the most important part of any assignment is not just knowing the rules written out,

18:20.060 --> 18:23.360
but what is inside the heart of he who is giving the grave.

18:23.360 --> 18:30.860
This flag, with B's and best-of-gons, for me, it can't be but S-tier.

18:30.860 --> 18:31.500
Class dismissed.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.720
you
