0	5600	Hello class, your homework assignment, as the US states that you are, was to make your state flag.
5600	11000	A flag to stir pride in your citizens. A flag to stand proud on the American stage.
11000	15900	A tough task, though not too tough with the guidelines I gave you upon which you will be graded.
15900	20400	1. Keep it simple, something a child could draw, even if they need to simplify it again. Good enough.
20400	27800	2. Make it distinct at a distance. A flag is not a poster, it's not wallpaper, it's not a patch, it's not money or anything else looked at up close.
27800	36000	No tiny details, it's a flag. It'll be flying from afar, among other flags, and when the wind stops, you still need to be able to spot yours.
36000	42000	3. Colors or fewer. Unless you really know what you're doing, but if you think you do, you probably don't.
42000	49200	4. Symbols. Have them. Your colors and what you design with them should mean something. It should say something about your citizens.
49200	57700	5. Words on a flag. The ideal number is zero. It's a flag, not a note that you're passing in class. Thank you, I'll take that.
57700	62900	6. If you violated this rule, I hope you hid those words in a design, because you will be marked down.
62900	69700	7. And there is one thing you were absolutely forbidden from writing, because a flag is not a name tag.
69700	75500	8. If you wrote your name on your flag, your flag fails as a flag. No exceptions.
75500	79500	Alright, let's just get a quick look and see how everybody did. Hold up your flags, please.
80500	88700	Alright, because you're all so internet to keep your attention, you're getting put on a tier list from S to F.
88700	95100	S for super, F for you guessed it, you failed. And I can see that so many of you did already.
95100	103700	The F tier is going to be absolutely bursting, so we're going to break it down into a tier list inside a tier list, S to F for the F tier.
103700	109300	Alright, let's just get the worst out of the way. Kansas, Montana, Wisconsin, Oregon, that's you. I'm sorry, get up here.
109300	114700	You guys and so many of your classmates went with this basic template, seal on blue,
114700	121700	that all you bluebells, by copying each other, have each made each other so much worse in the distinct-at-a-distance department.
121700	128900	And you four, you started with seals in the center, which is already subpar, but signing that seal, so much sorrier.
128900	136500	And Montana, this kerning, my eyes can only take so much. Wisconsin, unironically, a cheese-based flag would have been better.
137100	145100	And, oh, an objection from Oregon. You have a different design on the back, and this is so much better. I'm gonna give it a pass.
145100	148300	You should just ditch the front of your flag and be all in on the beaver.
148300	157500	Hey, I wouldn't be laughing, California. It's your turn up here now, and I know you think your flag is awesome, but you seem to have scrawled California across it.
157500	165100	And don't think bragging about the Republic is going to help your grade. I know all about that phase as an independent country that lasted,
165100	173100	but what was it again? Oh right, barely three weeks. Rather a shorter time than some other nation-states I could mention.
173100	180700	And about your bear, look at him. Really look, California. That's a scared bear. Why did you draw him that way?
180700	188700	This is A tier, but F tier. Hey, are you crying? There's no crying in flag design. There's just doing better, which you easily can.
188800	194800	Next, Dakota Sisters, you're up, and you've both written your name, so instant fail.
194800	200100	But north, your seal is at least better drawn, so D tier, F tier, and south.
200100	204200	You've picked a brighter blue, which is a bit distinct, so I'll put you on tier with your sister.
204200	210600	But wait, did you write your name on the flag twice? F tier twice then, but suggestion, Dakotas.
210600	217000	You both obviously like this spiky design element, so maybe you could do a cool north-south sister states thing with that.
217000	220100	You know, bring some of that Greenland Antarctic energy to the states.
220100	226500	Now, all of you listen up. Today is not the final day of your judgment. Better is always an option.
226500	233200	Take Miss Mississippi. She started with this flag, but recently felt it didn't fit her, and so transitioned to this one.
233200	238100	Yes, she added words, which I will mark her down for, but they're hidden as hidden words can be.
238100	242300	Then she put her favorite flower in the center, which is a bit too complicated for my liking.
242300	246800	But you know what? This flag symbolically says Miss Magnolia, Mississippi.
246800	250500	Exactly what a flag needs to do. Solid C.
250500	257500	And let her serve as a model of achievable improvement for everyone who fails today, especially California.
257500	260000	Thank you, Miss Mississippi. You can sit down now.
260000	263200	Next up, Nebraska. At least you didn't write your name real big on the bottom.
263200	268300	F.D. Vermont. Not terrible for F tier, obviously. Best-looking seal so far, I guess. C tier.
268300	271500	Maine. You wrote your name real big, but in a classy way.
271500	274900	I can't believe you girls are even making me have to compare seal designs so closely.
274900	276300	Uh, F tier, C tier.
276300	279800	Ugh, I'm getting blue-blinded. Can someone help me out here?
279800	284100	New Mexico. What vexological virtuosity is this?
284100	288300	A design in the center, so simple and sacred of the Zia people,
288300	292600	done with bold colors that match the New Mexican landscape itself.
292600	294400	It's enchanting.
294400	297500	Need I even say the words, New Mexico?
297500	300200	S tier. Thank you for giving me hope.
300200	301300	Okay, back to the Bluebells.
301300	306400	New Hampshire. Seal on blue, but you did kinda go all in on the seal, and the ship is pretty good.
306400	310700	I didn't think I needed a rule to say that a flag is not a painting of other flags,
310700	312600	but here you are with three.
312600	317900	F.B. Connecticut. Fan of the grapes, huh, kid? Nah, I'm good, thanks.
317900	320700	Purple is objectively the worst color, but you know what?
320700	323300	You could do something with that, and it would stand out.
323300	325800	In the meantime, F.D. Enjoy your grapes.
325800	331400	Michigan. Circum spice? I will, and all I see is more boring blue.
331400	334500	F.D. Can anyone do blue but good?
334500	338000	Ah, Alaska. Look at this, ladies.
338000	343000	The northernest state showing off the northernest star in an open blue sky.
343000	347800	And she didn't feel the need to write Alaska across it.
347800	350600	Which must have been pretty tempting, eh, California?
350600	356900	And even better, the companion constellation of the Big Dipper is but the tail of Ursa Major,
356900	359100	a great bear in the sky.
359100	364300	The animal most associated with this state and important to the Alaska natives.
364300	368700	How clever, Alaska. I simply must give you the Best Bear award.
368700	371900	This flag is pretty top tier, but...
371900	379100	The low contrast design with the sparse stars does make it difficult to differentiate at a distance.
379100	381400	Especially in, say, dark winters.
381400	387800	And it breaks my brain that your official vertical orientation is for the north star to be at the bottom.
387800	389000	North star, top star!
389000	395200	Look, this is an amazing patch which I think comes pre-installed on every backpack in Alaska,
395200	397400	so your citizens obviously love it.
397400	400500	It's a good flag. It's the best bear. Best in B tier.
400500	403600	Oh, sorry, Miss Missouri. I didn't see you've also got a bear.
403600	408000	Two bears? No, wait. There's a bear on the seal the bears are holding?
408000	410600	You definitely win most bears, darling.
410600	414700	And most stars with, wow, 61.
414700	418700	13 for the original 13 states on the American seal,
418700	421700	which you put inside your seal for seal-ception.
421700	426400	Then 24 stars for your entry as the 24th state twice.
426400	431800	It's very busy, and you put all those bears and stars and words atop a tricolor,
431800	433900	the most basic of all flag designs.
433900	437700	But blessed be, you didn't write your name, so I'm passing you.
437700	440000	D tier. Anyone else who didn't write their name?
440000	443500	Ah, Rhode Island. You wrote Hope, but I'll take it at this point.
443500	447900	This is also quite the square, but I guess you're going all in on the sailing motif
447900	450800	with the anchors and the colors, and it works.
450800	453900	C tier. On to the Commonwealth Club.
453900	456100	No more hiding in the back. It's your turn.
456100	458300	Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At least it's not blue,
458300	460800	and it's sort of simple in comparison, of course.
460800	463500	F.C. Kentucky, I know you like being in the Commonwealth Club,
463500	465000	but you can't write it on your flag.
465000	467300	Well, you can, but you're getting F tier, D tier for that.
467300	470400	Pennsylvania. If you're gonna do Seal on Blue, this is pretty good.
470400	473500	And you didn't write Commonwealth of Pennsylvania anywhere.
473500	474900	F tier, B tier.
474900	478100	And come on up, Captain of the Club, Commonwealth of Virginia.
478100	479100	Let's see what you've done.
479100	481400	Oh god, are you trying to get me demonetized?
481400	486600	Your flag has nudity, murder, and an explicit call to violence.
486600	488700	But you know what, Virginia? That's kind of badass.
488700	489200	F.B.
489200	492000	Oh, hi Ohio. Another oddly shaped flag.
492000	495200	You know this is more of a cape than a flag, right?
495200	496900	Right, you do.
496900	499600	Well, it's very much America.
499600	501000	I'm gonna give it a B.
501000	503000	Next up, Delaware.
503000	503900	Delaware.
503900	508200	Fully writing out the date on the bottom is just such a bottom tier move.
508200	509400	I know you're the forgotten state,
509400	511600	and you want to emphasize that you're really the first,
511600	513300	but there's gotta be a better way.
513300	513900	F.F.
513900	515700	Wyoming.
515700	517500	Let me tell you something, Wyoming.
517500	521200	Let me tell you what I foresee as the final chapter of my life.
521200	525700	When age or end times come, when my work is finished and forgotten,
525700	529000	I will travel to your great state to find a plot of land,
529000	531700	one with a cozy cabin, a porch out front,
531700	535800	where pet buffalo by my side, shotgun across my lap.
535800	539600	I will watch the sun set for however many days are left.
539600	541700	For me, for us all.
541700	547300	And in the sky above this scene, I will fly this flag of forever west with pride.
547300	554600	But I will have to get it custom printed to remove this terrible, needless seal you've stamped in the center.
554600	557200	A seal upon which you have written your name.
557200	559300	It's so close to epic.
559300	565000	But for now, I must, by my own unbreakable rule, give it an F.
565000	566600	But S-tier F, obviously.
566600	569300	Now, who's going to be next?
569300	570400	All the I's.
570400	571000	Europe.
571000	572700	Starting with Idaho.
572700	573600	You wrote your name twice.
573600	574600	I can't even right now.
574600	575400	F.F.
575400	576000	Iowa.
576000	577000	You've got your name too.
577000	579300	And a whole sentence of instruction.
579300	581300	Have you won the most words award?
581300	582800	Oh no, not even close.
582800	587600	Idaho beat you for 12 to tie with Nebraska, to be beaten by Wyoming for 13.
587600	590200	And first place goes to South Dakota.
590200	591600	17 words.
591600	593300	But that doesn't make this any less bad, Iowa.
593300	595000	And you also wrote your name.
595000	596200	F-tier, obviously.
596200	597900	But at least it's much merica.
597900	599200	So F-tier, A-tier.
599200	599900	Indiana.
599900	601400	Oh, what a relief, Indiana.
601400	602100	Pretty good.
602100	604800	Colors are similar to Alaska, but with more stars.
604800	606600	It's more identifiable at a distance.
606600	609000	And you've done your own thing with the torch of liberty.
609000	609800	It's pretty good.
609800	612200	I'm going to give it an what are you doing?
613800	614800	F-tier, A-tier.
614800	615800	Sit down.
615800	616800	Last of the eyes.
616800	617800	Illinois.
617800	620800	You've also gone with an eagle, but it is not very good.
620800	621800	I'm sorry.
621800	625800	And your backwards sovereignty on the scroll points for realism, I guess.
625800	627800	But a flag is not a painting.
627800	629800	And you added the date of this design?
629800	630800	Why?
630800	635800	Oh, this is literally just the seal of Illinois on a white background written above the word
635800	636800	Illinois.
636800	637800	It's terrible.
637800	638800	F-tier, F-tier.
638800	639800	Colorado.
639800	640800	Colorado.
640800	643800	I feel like you're really trying to push my boundaries here, Colorado.
643800	645800	The design is simple while still standing out.
645800	650800	And I'd give it a B, but this giant C, it's a little on the nose.
650800	652800	Don't you think, Colorado?
652800	653800	And you know what else it is?
653800	654800	It's writing.
654800	656800	Writing on a flag.
656800	657800	C for C-tier.
657800	658800	And don't point to Ohio.
658800	659800	She did it better.
659800	660800	Most people didn't even notice the O.
660800	661800	Next, Minnesota.
661800	662800	Terrible.
662800	664800	Oof, this is just terrible.
664800	668800	Your name isn't as big and bad as the other bluebells, but the busyness is bottom-tier
668800	669800	bad.
669800	671720	Wisconsin, I was too harsh on you before.
671720	673960	This is the worst flag in the union.
673960	674960	Come on, Minnesota.
674960	677800	You're America's blonde scion of Scandinavia.
677800	680180	A classic flag designs itself.
680180	681180	But this?
681180	683040	I need a visual palette cleanser now.
683040	684880	Ah, Alabama.
684880	688840	Can't go wrong with a simple shape, identifiable at a distance, vertical perfection, and a
688840	690800	lesson to everyone.
690800	693660	So much more can be done with so much less.
693660	696040	This flag would fit in on the international stage.
696040	697540	A for Alabama.
697540	700080	State of West Virginia, home of hearty Appalachia.
700080	701620	You deserve better than this.
701620	702620	FD.
702620	703620	Arkansas.
703620	704620	You know what, Arkansas?
704620	708900	Even with writing your name real big across the center, I think you've made it kind
708900	709900	of work.
709900	714100	I can't pass you, obviously, but it's very America, and diamonds are your thing.
714100	716120	I'm gonna give it F-tier, A-tier.
716120	718980	And speaking of words that work, get up here, Nevada.
718980	723580	Now obviously, this flag is bad and boring, which is a crime because you get the award
723580	726860	for the two best words ever written on a flag.
726860	728900	Battle born.
728900	730700	Battle born.
730700	731820	It's awesome.
731820	735140	And unlike some other states trying to big up their history that we won't mention, you
735140	739700	really did become a state for the union in the middle of America's bloodiest war.
739700	744060	I can't believe I'm going to say this, but if two words ever deserve to be put in
744060	748340	impact font on a flag, battle born are those words.
748340	749340	Do it, Nevada.
749340	750340	Do it, do it, do it.
750340	751340	Maryland.
751340	752460	Oh, my.
752460	754280	It's hideous.
754280	758840	So hideous, it falls right off the bottom to land back on the top.
758840	759840	S-tier, Maryland.
759840	762720	I don't care what anyone says, wear it with pride.
762720	763720	Louisiana.
763720	770260	That pelican is vulning herself, which is a heraldic term meaning to injure herself,
770260	773560	making you the only flag to show actual blood.
773560	777760	I must remind you that a flag is not heraldry, but at least it's unique.
777760	778760	FB.
778760	779760	Tennessee.
779760	783720	I think people underrate your flag, Tennessee, partly because of this blue bar on the side,
783720	788080	which seems a bit random when looked at on a screen, but was added to keep it distinct
788080	791240	when flying with or without wind, which totally works.
791240	795540	And your three stars are for the three grand divisions of your rather rectangular state
795540	796740	unified.
796740	797740	This flag?
797740	800840	On screen it's a B, but in the air it's an A.
800840	801840	Washington.
801840	802840	Washington.
802840	810820	A flag is not money, Washington, and this is real extra awkward because DC, who isn't
810820	817640	even in this class, absolutely wrecked you with this A-tier flag that represents Washington
817640	824100	so much better by adapting his family coat of arms, not drawing his facey face.
824100	827980	But at least it's money green so it stands out from the blues.
827980	828980	FC.
828980	829980	Hawaii.
829980	832220	I have complicated feelings about this flag, Hawaii.
832220	835780	It's ugly, but in a bit of the magnificent Maryland way.
835780	839420	The eight stripes for the eight islands don't align at all with the Union Jack, which is
839420	842940	also historically confused as you were never part of the British Empire.
842940	847260	You instead just took their flag to use for your kingdom as your own, which is a pretty
847260	848260	bold move.
848260	853220	Well, you didn't write Kingdom of Hawaii across it and you love your rainbows, and if an American
853220	856140	flag was a rainbow, this would be that flag.
856140	857700	I'm going to give it a B.
857700	858700	Oklahoma.
858700	860940	Ah, you're another real heartbreaker here, kid.
860940	865940	We're just going to ignore this for now and look at this, which is not a seal, but a buffalo
865940	868300	skin shield of the Osea nation.
868300	872360	Much cooler, and with a pipe of the plains American Indians crossed with the olive branch
872360	877540	for Europeans who were becoming Americans, you've done by far the best job of symbolically
877540	882540	trying to address something very American that other flags struggled with.
882540	883540	Minnesota.
883540	887140	I'm giving it an FC because there's something here that could be even epicker.
887140	888140	Carolina Sisters.
888140	889180	South first.
889180	893500	It's a bit disjointed, and I know you love the Palmetto, but everyone thinks this is
893500	898540	a palm tree, and it's weird because you have the angel oak, one of the most famous and
898540	902240	beautiful trees in the world, which could make a much better design, and then there
902240	906120	would be zero chance of people confusing you for California.
906120	910820	But unlike California, you didn't write your name, so you pass, but this complicated plant
910820	914020	in the center, it's just not as good as Miss Mississippi's.
914020	915020	D-tier.
915020	916020	North next.
916020	920420	Now, I'm totally biased toward my adoptive state, and when I see this flag flying around
920420	924820	Raleigh, it provokes in me pride of Old North, even if it does look a bit too much like someone
924820	925820	else's flag.
925820	930700	But if I'm trying to be consistent, I can't give a flag with not just letters but entire
930700	932580	words more than C-tier.
932580	936300	I don't think either of you need a redesign desperately, so many others are ahead of you
936300	941180	on that line, but perhaps you sisters could, like the Dakotas, consider a Carolinian combo
941180	942320	for the future.
942320	943320	Could be cool.
943320	944320	Next, New Jersey.
944320	948140	That color is a real choice, but you know what, at least it stands out and your seal
948140	949140	isn't awful.
949140	950140	F-tier B-tier.
950140	951140	Arizona.
951140	952140	A-tier?
952140	953140	Awesome, Arizona.
953140	957140	You've got a red and yellow sunset that looks like your state and is also a nod to the Spanish
957140	958140	settlers.
958140	961100	I know some don't like the copper star, but they are wrong, because you're the Copper
961100	962100	Queen.
962100	963700	And it also makes me think of Sheriffs of the Wild West.
963700	965740	Did I already say A-tier Arizona?
965740	966740	A-tier Arizona.
966740	968580	Now for New York.
968580	970320	New York.
970320	971320	New York.
971320	977540	I'm a native son of your great state, so it hurts me when I say, of all the flags, yours
977540	979020	is my biggest disappointment.
979100	981300	Sure, your seal is better than most.
981300	982300	F-tier, C-tier.
982300	983300	Whatever.
983300	987820	But you are the Empire State, daughter of actual empire.
987820	993820	If you aspire to that awesome moniker, how do you think your flag compares to, say, this?
993820	1000100	Let's just visit London real quick, and here you'll see Union Jacks for sale everywhere.
1000100	1006580	Union Jacks used everywhere, because UK did S-tier work back in London's sister city
1006580	1007780	of New York.
1007780	1010980	Can you even find a state flag?
1010980	1017500	And are you really going to let New Jersey have a more identifiable flag than you?
1017500	1019140	New Jersey?
1019140	1021300	Excelsior to S-tier New York.
1021300	1022620	Now get out of here.
1022620	1023620	Georgia.
1023620	1028260	I feel like it almost kind of works with the seal in the corner, but ultimately doesn't.
1028260	1032000	And it's a little bit too much like North Carolina, which is a little bit too much like
1032000	1033000	somebody else.
1033000	1035260	You didn't write your name, but you did write a lot of words.
1035260	1036260	D-tier.
1036260	1038740	Alright, enough foreshadowing.
1038740	1040320	Get up here, Texas.
1040320	1042900	You already know this is an A-tier flag.
1042900	1044220	I don't need to tell you that.
1044220	1048280	But you've also done just so much work with state pride.
1048280	1053100	You and your citizens love and use this flag like you're still the Republic of Texas.
1053100	1055740	And you're getting the bonus points you deserve for it.
1055740	1057740	Florida.
1057740	1064460	Did you... did you just copy Alabama's flag but make it worse, and you wrote your name
1064460	1065460	on it?
1065660	1069380	F-tier, but A-tier only because you're copying a good design.
1069380	1072060	Please try again on your own this time.
1072060	1074180	And last up, it's you, Utah.
1074180	1077660	Oh, I see you have a last-minute redesign in hand.
1077660	1079060	Which is it gonna be?
1079060	1081380	You have chosen wisely.
1081380	1084340	This is a great and meaningful flag.
1084340	1088840	The symbol for the industry of your people, atop their state star in the nation, built
1088840	1093400	on your red rocks before the white peaks and under the blue sky.
1093400	1094660	It's A-tier.
1094660	1100060	Class, the most important part of any assignment is not just knowing the rules written out,
1100060	1103360	but what is inside the heart of he who is giving the grave.
1103360	1110860	This flag, with B's and best-of-gons, for me, it can't be but S-tier.
1110860	1111500	Class dismissed.
1124660	1126720	you
