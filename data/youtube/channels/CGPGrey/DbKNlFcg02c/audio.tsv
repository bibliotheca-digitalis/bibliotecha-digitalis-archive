0	6740	Antarctica. Home to the South Pole, zz, penguins, and about 5,000 people during the summers.
6740	10100	But less than 1,000 during the ever dark winter.
10100	14640	No one lives on the continent permanently, so who owns Antarctica?
14640	21140	Most stuff outside national borders, the sea floor, the moon, really all of space, is the common heritage of mankind.
21140	26400	It belongs to none of us and all of us, held in trust for future generations.
26460	32140	Which is nice, if perhaps a bit presumptive, to say that the entire universe is ours,
32140	37180	and maybe someone will have something to say about that eventually, story for another time.
37180	39100	But still, well done humanity.
39100	45840	Except it's never that simple, because the paperwork on Antarctica sort of says common heritage of mankind,
45840	48000	but it doesn't go all in.
48000	48720	Here's why.
48720	53800	Explorers started landing in Antarctica in about the 1800s, planting flags and making claims,
53840	59840	but these claims were a bit hollow, because on the civilization tech tree, Antarctica wasn't colonizable.
59840	65600	Nonetheless, like Monopoly, the optimal colonial strategy is claim everything you land on.
65600	73600	In the early 1900s, the UK toyed with claiming all of Antarctica before scaling back her ambitions to just the coastal parts she had explored to the South Pole.
73600	78080	France also claimed coastal explorations to the pole, followed by Norway, followed by the Nazis.
78080	83520	Mid-century, Argentina and Chile claimed slices overlapping with the UK, who they figured was rather too busy at the time to care,
83520	86560	but later she and her now independent colonies totally did.
86560	92480	This left Antarctica a mess of competing claims at a bad time to have large territorial disputes.
92480	98080	Complicating things, the United States and the Soviet Union gave themselves the right to make a claim onto Antarctica.
98080	99680	Not now, but maybe later.
99680	105560	Given this, quite remarkably, in 1959, the US and USSR and ten other countries,
105560	109520	Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa and the UK,
109520	117680	made a treaty to ease the tensions, saying that on Antarctica, there would be no military, no mining and no nuclear exploding.
117680	125040	The Antarctica paperwork is the first Cold War disarmament treaty and set aside the continent for science and nature.
125040	128880	By the way, because it's a nature preserve, there's a rule about garbage.
128880	131520	Leave nothing behind. Nothing.
131520	135440	Travel to Antarctica in the summer and you'll fly back with your poo in the winter.
135440	140160	So this looks pretty great. What's the problem with the line about common heritage?
140160	149520	Well, no one actually gave up their claims on Antarctica because the only way to get everyone to sign was to include this clause, which sidesteps the issue.
149520	156640	Basically saying countries will act as though Antarctica is the common heritage of mankind and as though they have no claims,
156640	159840	but they aren't legally, for realsies, giving up anything.
159840	164800	Which is why maps of Antarctica often include the current state of claim wedges.
164800	171520	This blank spot, by the way, is nobody's, leaving it the largest territory unclaimed on Earth by any nation.
171520	173280	So far, anyway.
173280	179680	Now, unlike the colonial days, countries have the tech to build permanently staffed bases on Antarctica
179680	185120	and it just so happens that countries build their bases in their own claims.
185120	188400	Leaving no clear answer to this question.
188400	193680	According to the treaty, Antarctica belongs to everyone, but the treaty itself has an intentional hole.
193680	198320	So Antarctica exists in this quantum state where the claims are real and unreal.
198320	205760	Some countries build within their borders and some countries without claims, like China, build their bases on the continent wherever,
205760	208800	because it belongs to everyone, right guys?
208800	216240	These claims don't really matter until they do in the 2040s when the mining ban comes up for review.
216240	222400	Oh, and there's possibly a lot of oil in Antarctica, not to mention 70% of the Earth's fresh water,
222400	225520	which could be the more valuable resource in the future.
225520	232960	The US and the Soviet Russia might just yet dust off those one free claim because I say so tickets.
232960	236160	But for now, Antarctica is as the treaty intended.
236160	240960	A continental nature preserve and scientific research haven.
