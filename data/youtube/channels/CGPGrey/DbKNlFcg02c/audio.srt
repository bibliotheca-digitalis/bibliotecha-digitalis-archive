1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
Antarctica. Home to the South Pole, zz, penguins, and about 5,000 people during the summers.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,100
But less than 1,000 during the ever dark winter.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,640
No one lives on the continent permanently, so who owns Antarctica?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,140
Most stuff outside national borders, the sea floor, the moon, really all of space, is the common heritage of mankind.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,400
It belongs to none of us and all of us, held in trust for future generations.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,140
Which is nice, if perhaps a bit presumptive, to say that the entire universe is ours,

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,180
and maybe someone will have something to say about that eventually, story for another time.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,100
But still, well done humanity.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,840
Except it's never that simple, because the paperwork on Antarctica sort of says common heritage of mankind,

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
but it doesn't go all in.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Here's why.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,800
Explorers started landing in Antarctica in about the 1800s, planting flags and making claims,

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,840
but these claims were a bit hollow, because on the civilization tech tree, Antarctica wasn't colonizable.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,600
Nonetheless, like Monopoly, the optimal colonial strategy is claim everything you land on.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,600
In the early 1900s, the UK toyed with claiming all of Antarctica before scaling back her ambitions to just the coastal parts she had explored to the South Pole.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,080
France also claimed coastal explorations to the pole, followed by Norway, followed by the Nazis.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,520
Mid-century, Argentina and Chile claimed slices overlapping with the UK, who they figured was rather too busy at the time to care,

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,560
but later she and her now independent colonies totally did.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,480
This left Antarctica a mess of competing claims at a bad time to have large territorial disputes.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,080
Complicating things, the United States and the Soviet Union gave themselves the right to make a claim onto Antarctica.

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
Not now, but maybe later.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,560
Given this, quite remarkably, in 1959, the US and USSR and ten other countries,

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,520
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa and the UK,

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,680
made a treaty to ease the tensions, saying that on Antarctica, there would be no military, no mining and no nuclear exploding.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,040
The Antarctica paperwork is the first Cold War disarmament treaty and set aside the continent for science and nature.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,880
By the way, because it's a nature preserve, there's a rule about garbage.

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Leave nothing behind. Nothing.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
Travel to Antarctica in the summer and you'll fly back with your poo in the winter.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,160
So this looks pretty great. What's the problem with the line about common heritage?

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:29,520
Well, no one actually gave up their claims on Antarctica because the only way to get everyone to sign was to include this clause, which sidesteps the issue.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,640
Basically saying countries will act as though Antarctica is the common heritage of mankind and as though they have no claims,

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,840
but they aren't legally, for realsies, giving up anything.

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Which is why maps of Antarctica often include the current state of claim wedges.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,520
This blank spot, by the way, is nobody's, leaving it the largest territory unclaimed on Earth by any nation.

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,280
So far, anyway.

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,680
Now, unlike the colonial days, countries have the tech to build permanently staffed bases on Antarctica

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,120
and it just so happens that countries build their bases in their own claims.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,400
Leaving no clear answer to this question.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
According to the treaty, Antarctica belongs to everyone, but the treaty itself has an intentional hole.

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,320
So Antarctica exists in this quantum state where the claims are real and unreal.

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,760
Some countries build within their borders and some countries without claims, like China, build their bases on the continent wherever,

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,800
because it belongs to everyone, right guys?

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,240
These claims don't really matter until they do in the 2040s when the mining ban comes up for review.

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,400
Oh, and there's possibly a lot of oil in Antarctica, not to mention 70% of the Earth's fresh water,

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,520
which could be the more valuable resource in the future.

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,960
The US and the Soviet Russia might just yet dust off those one free claim because I say so tickets.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,160
But for now, Antarctica is as the treaty intended.

48
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,960
A continental nature preserve and scientific research haven.
