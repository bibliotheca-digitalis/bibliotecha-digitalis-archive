00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
Twas a Sunday morning when I woke up, happy and ready for the day, when suddenly your

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,040
access to YouTube has been suspended.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,280
Why?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,520
Because of a perceived violation of the terms of service.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
Really?

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
What could I have possibly done?

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Irrelevant!

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,400
YouTube reserves the right to germinate your account at any time for any reason.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Was this helpful?

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,460
Yes, no.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,320
This messenger from Olympus had reminded me that we are all but homunculi at the whims

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,240
of a capricious algorithmic god.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,640
Which is useful to keep in mind.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,040
So yes, technically, but I wasn't happy with the gods, so I did what any brave hero

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
would do.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
Towards Olympus, I tweeted.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Alas, it was the weekend and there was no one to hear my chirping.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,600
All was despair.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,260
Now, you're able to watch this video because I did, when the work week started, eventually

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,680
make it through the system.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,880
To discover YouTube had suspended my account for impersonation of me.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,040
Which was a bitâ€¦ what?

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,260
Maybe the YouTube bots thought my verified channel was acting a bit too bot-like, which

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,680
is ridiculous, so they shut it down.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,800
But I may never know.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,280
Anyway, I'm here reciting this hero's ballad as a reminder to everyone who makes things

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,480
on a platform that the gods are arbitrary and their rules of who can speak from Olympus

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,300
are but words of whimsy on the wind.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,220
And follow them or not, you may be knocked off at any time for any reason.

30
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,380
There is only one of the ancient sleepy titans left from the pre-web days whose indifference

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,700
to all allows all upon his mountain.

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
E-mail.

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,920
Though his son, Gmail, sure is trying to dethrone him, but the titan still holds on.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,980
For now at least.

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,240
What I'm saying is, if you're a creator, I strongly suggest you get yourself an email

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
list.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,760
If you're a viewer who likes the videos I make, consider signing up for my email list.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,200
There's about 100,000 of you already there, which is amazing.

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,100
But also, far short of the millions of you here, that YouTube says it very diligently

40
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,900
and very reliably notifies about my videos.

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,900
So before you watch the newest one, which I'm sure you got notified for, please consider

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,640
clicking here and joining my email list.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,000
While you're doing that, I'm going to work on my next video, and also prepare a

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,780
sacrifice to the gods to pray they don't smite me again before it's done.
