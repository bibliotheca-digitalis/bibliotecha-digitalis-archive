00:00.000 --> 00:05.080
Twas a Sunday morning when I woke up, happy and ready for the day, when suddenly your

00:05.080 --> 00:07.040
access to YouTube has been suspended.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.280
Why?

00:08.280 --> 00:10.520
Because of a perceived violation of the terms of service.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
Really?

00:11.520 --> 00:13.200
What could I have possibly done?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
Irrelevant!

00:14.200 --> 00:17.400
YouTube reserves the right to germinate your account at any time for any reason.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.400
Was this helpful?

00:18.400 --> 00:19.460
Yes, no.

00:19.460 --> 00:24.320
This messenger from Olympus had reminded me that we are all but homunculi at the whims

00:24.320 --> 00:27.240
of a capricious algorithmic god.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.640
Which is useful to keep in mind.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.040
So yes, technically, but I wasn't happy with the gods, so I did what any brave hero

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
would do.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.200
Towards Olympus, I tweeted.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.240
Alas, it was the weekend and there was no one to hear my chirping.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.600
All was despair.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.260
Now, you're able to watch this video because I did, when the work week started, eventually

00:50.260 --> 00:51.680
make it through the system.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.880
To discover YouTube had suspended my account for impersonation of me.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.040
Which was a bitâ€¦ what?

00:59.040 --> 01:03.260
Maybe the YouTube bots thought my verified channel was acting a bit too bot-like, which

01:03.260 --> 01:05.680
is ridiculous, so they shut it down.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.800
But I may never know.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.280
Anyway, I'm here reciting this hero's ballad as a reminder to everyone who makes things

01:11.280 --> 01:16.480
on a platform that the gods are arbitrary and their rules of who can speak from Olympus

01:16.480 --> 01:19.300
are but words of whimsy on the wind.

01:19.300 --> 01:24.220
And follow them or not, you may be knocked off at any time for any reason.

01:24.220 --> 01:29.380
There is only one of the ancient sleepy titans left from the pre-web days whose indifference

01:29.380 --> 01:32.700
to all allows all upon his mountain.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700
E-mail.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.920
Though his son, Gmail, sure is trying to dethrone him, but the titan still holds on.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.980
For now at least.

01:39.980 --> 01:44.240
What I'm saying is, if you're a creator, I strongly suggest you get yourself an email

01:44.240 --> 01:45.240
list.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.760
If you're a viewer who likes the videos I make, consider signing up for my email list.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.200
There's about 100,000 of you already there, which is amazing.

01:53.200 --> 01:59.100
But also, far short of the millions of you here, that YouTube says it very diligently

01:59.100 --> 02:02.900
and very reliably notifies about my videos.

02:02.900 --> 02:07.900
So before you watch the newest one, which I'm sure you got notified for, please consider

02:07.900 --> 02:10.640
clicking here and joining my email list.

02:10.640 --> 02:15.000
While you're doing that, I'm going to work on my next video, and also prepare a

02:15.000 --> 02:19.780
sacrifice to the gods to pray they don't smite me again before it's done.
