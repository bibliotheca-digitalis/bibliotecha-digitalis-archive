0	2800	On a jury, you know your options, guilty or not.
2800	5720	But there's another choice that neither the judge nor the lawyers will tell you,
5720	10240	often because they're not allowed to, and also because it might be better if you don't know.
10240	12560	This video will tell you that third choice, but be warned,
12560	15880	simply watching may prevent you from ever serving on a jury.
15880	19320	So this is your last chance to hit the pause button before you learn about...
19320	23200	Jury nullification, when the defendant is 100% beyond a reasonable doubt guilty,
23200	26040	but the jurors also think he shouldn't be punished.
26040	28840	The jury can nullify the law and let him go free.
28880	30760	But before you're on your next jury and yell,
30760	35240	NUL BOOYAH at the judge, you should know that just talking about jury nullification
35240	37720	in the wrong circumstances can get you arrested.
37720	41840	Though a video such as this one simply acknowledging the existence of jury nullification
41840	44840	and in no way advocating it is totally okay.
44840	46000	And while we're at it,
46000	47800	CGP Grey is not a lawyer, this is not legal advice,
47800	49800	this is meant for entertainment purposes only, seriously guy,
49800	52800	don't do anything in a court of law based on what an internet video told you, no joke.
52800	54040	So why can't you do this?
54040	56120	It's because nullification isn't in the law,
56120	59400	but exists as a logical consequence of two other laws.
59400	61720	First, the juries can't be punished for a wrong decision
61720	65040	no matter what the witnesses, DNA evidence, or video proof show.
65040	67840	That's the point of a jury, to be the final decider.
67840	70080	And second, when a defendant is found not guilty,
70080	73240	that defendant can't be tried again for the same crime.
73240	76080	So there are only two stated options, guilty or not,
76080	80160	it's just that jury nullification is when the words of the jurors don't match their thoughts,
80160	84160	for which they can't be punished and their not guilty decision can't be changed.
84160	87120	These laws are necessary for juries to exist within a fair system,
87120	89600	but the logical consequence is contentious.
89600	91840	Lawyers and judges argue about jury nullification
91840	94120	like physicists argue about quantum mechanics.
94120	96880	Both are difficult to observe, and the interpretation of both
96880	100800	has a huge philosophical ramification for the subject as a whole.
100800	103120	Is jury nullification the righteous will of the people,
103120	106640	or an anarchy of twelve, or just how citizens judge their laws?
106640	110080	The go-to example in favor of nullification is the Fugitive Slave Law,
110080	113360	when northern juries refuse to convict escaped slaves and set them free.
113360	114240	Can't argue with that.
114240	118240	But the anarchy side is southern juries refusing to convict lynch mobs,
118240	120160	not humanity at its best.
120160	123080	But both of these are juries nullifying the law.
123080	127480	And also, juries have two options for where their thoughts may differ from their words.
127480	130360	Jury nullification usually refers to the non-guilty version,
130360	134840	but juries can convict without evidence just as easily as they can acquit in spite of it.
134840	138640	This is jury nullification too, and the jurors are protected by the first rule,
138640	142680	though the second doesn't apply, and judges do have the power to overrule a guilty verdict
142680	144840	if they think the jurors aren't the best.
144840	148120	And of course, a guilty defendant can appeal, at least for a little while,
148120	152440	which makes the guilty form of jury nullification weaker than the not-guilty kind.
152440	153400	Cold comfort, though.
153400	156360	Given the possibility of jurors who might ignore the law as written,
156360	158720	it's not surprising when picking jurors for a trial,
158720	161520	lawyers, whose existence is dependent on an orderly society,
161520	164840	will ask about nullification usually in the slightly roundabout way.
164840	168160	Do you have any beliefs that might prevent you from making a decision based strictly on the law?
168160	171200	If, after learning about jury nullification, you think it's a good idea,
171200	173000	answer yes and you'll be rejected,
173000	177720	but answer no with the intent to get on the jury to nullify and you've just committed perjury,
177720	179400	technically a federal crime,
179400	182560	which makes the optimal strategy once on a jury to zip it.
182560	185640	But this introduces a problem for jurors who intend to nullify,
185640	189000	telling the other 11 angry men about your position is risky,
189000	193880	which makes nullification as a tool for fixing unjust laws nationwide problematic.
193880	197680	Not to mention about 95% of criminal charges in the United States never make it to trial
197680	200880	and rather end in a plea bargain, but that's a story for another time.
200880	205120	The only question about jury nullification that may matter in the end is if jurors should be told about it,
205120	208320	and the courts are near universal in their decision, no way.
208320	210240	Which, again, might seem self-interested,
210240	211720	courts do depend on the law,
211720	215440	but there's evidence that telling jurors about nullification changes the way they vote
215440	217400	by making evidence less relevant to them,
217400	220400	which isn't surprising, that's what nullification is.
220400	223800	But mock trials also show sympathetic defendants get more non-guilty verdicts
223800	226760	and unsympathetic defendants get more guilty verdicts in front of jurors
226760	230160	who were explicitly told about nullification compared to those who weren't.
230160	233400	Which sounds bad, but it's also easy to imagine situations
233400	237120	where jurors blindly following the law would be terribly unjust.
237120	240880	In the end, righteous will of the people, or anarchy, or citizen lawmaking,
240880	242800	the system leaves you to decide,
242800	246280	but as long as courts are fair, they require these rules,
246280	249200	so jury nullification will always be with us.
