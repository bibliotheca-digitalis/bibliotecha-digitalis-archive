1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
On a jury, you know your options, guilty or not.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,720
But there's another choice that neither the judge nor the lawyers will tell you,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,240
often because they're not allowed to, and also because it might be better if you don't know.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,560
This video will tell you that third choice, but be warned,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,880
simply watching may prevent you from ever serving on a jury.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,320
So this is your last chance to hit the pause button before you learn about...

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,200
Jury nullification, when the defendant is 100% beyond a reasonable doubt guilty,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,040
but the jurors also think he shouldn't be punished.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,840
The jury can nullify the law and let him go free.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,760
But before you're on your next jury and yell,

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,240
NUL BOOYAH at the judge, you should know that just talking about jury nullification

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,720
in the wrong circumstances can get you arrested.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,840
Though a video such as this one simply acknowledging the existence of jury nullification

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,840
and in no way advocating it is totally okay.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,000
And while we're at it,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
CGP Grey is not a lawyer, this is not legal advice,

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
this is meant for entertainment purposes only, seriously guy,

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
don't do anything in a court of law based on what an internet video told you, no joke.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,040
So why can't you do this?

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,120
It's because nullification isn't in the law,

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,400
but exists as a logical consequence of two other laws.

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,720
First, the juries can't be punished for a wrong decision

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,040
no matter what the witnesses, DNA evidence, or video proof show.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
That's the point of a jury, to be the final decider.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
And second, when a defendant is found not guilty,

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,240
that defendant can't be tried again for the same crime.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,080
So there are only two stated options, guilty or not,

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,160
it's just that jury nullification is when the words of the jurors don't match their thoughts,

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,160
for which they can't be punished and their not guilty decision can't be changed.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,120
These laws are necessary for juries to exist within a fair system,

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,600
but the logical consequence is contentious.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
Lawyers and judges argue about jury nullification

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,120
like physicists argue about quantum mechanics.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,880
Both are difficult to observe, and the interpretation of both

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,800
has a huge philosophical ramification for the subject as a whole.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,120
Is jury nullification the righteous will of the people,

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,640
or an anarchy of twelve, or just how citizens judge their laws?

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,080
The go-to example in favor of nullification is the Fugitive Slave Law,

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,360
when northern juries refuse to convict escaped slaves and set them free.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
Can't argue with that.

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
But the anarchy side is southern juries refusing to convict lynch mobs,

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,160
not humanity at its best.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,080
But both of these are juries nullifying the law.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,480
And also, juries have two options for where their thoughts may differ from their words.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,360
Jury nullification usually refers to the non-guilty version,

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,840
but juries can convict without evidence just as easily as they can acquit in spite of it.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,640
This is jury nullification too, and the jurors are protected by the first rule,

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,680
though the second doesn't apply, and judges do have the power to overrule a guilty verdict

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,840
if they think the jurors aren't the best.

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,120
And of course, a guilty defendant can appeal, at least for a little while,

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,440
which makes the guilty form of jury nullification weaker than the not-guilty kind.

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,400
Cold comfort, though.

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,360
Given the possibility of jurors who might ignore the law as written,

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,720
it's not surprising when picking jurors for a trial,

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,520
lawyers, whose existence is dependent on an orderly society,

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,840
will ask about nullification usually in the slightly roundabout way.

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,160
Do you have any beliefs that might prevent you from making a decision based strictly on the law?

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
If, after learning about jury nullification, you think it's a good idea,

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
answer yes and you'll be rejected,

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,720
but answer no with the intent to get on the jury to nullify and you've just committed perjury,

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
technically a federal crime,

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,560
which makes the optimal strategy once on a jury to zip it.

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,640
But this introduces a problem for jurors who intend to nullify,

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,000
telling the other 11 angry men about your position is risky,

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,880
which makes nullification as a tool for fixing unjust laws nationwide problematic.

66
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,680
Not to mention about 95% of criminal charges in the United States never make it to trial

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,880
and rather end in a plea bargain, but that's a story for another time.

68
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,120
The only question about jury nullification that may matter in the end is if jurors should be told about it,

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,320
and the courts are near universal in their decision, no way.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,240
Which, again, might seem self-interested,

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,720
courts do depend on the law,

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,440
but there's evidence that telling jurors about nullification changes the way they vote

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,400
by making evidence less relevant to them,

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
which isn't surprising, that's what nullification is.

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,800
But mock trials also show sympathetic defendants get more non-guilty verdicts

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,760
and unsympathetic defendants get more guilty verdicts in front of jurors

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,160
who were explicitly told about nullification compared to those who weren't.

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,400
Which sounds bad, but it's also easy to imagine situations

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,120
where jurors blindly following the law would be terribly unjust.

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,880
In the end, righteous will of the people, or anarchy, or citizen lawmaking,

81
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
the system leaves you to decide,

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,280
but as long as courts are fair, they require these rules,

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,200
so jury nullification will always be with us.
