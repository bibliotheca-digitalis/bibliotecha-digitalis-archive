00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
On a jury, you know your options, guilty or not.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.720
But there's another choice that neither the judge nor the lawyers will tell you,

00:05.720 --> 00:10.240
often because they're not allowed to, and also because it might be better if you don't know.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.560
This video will tell you that third choice, but be warned,

00:12.560 --> 00:15.880
simply watching may prevent you from ever serving on a jury.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.320
So this is your last chance to hit the pause button before you learn about...

00:19.320 --> 00:23.200
Jury nullification, when the defendant is 100% beyond a reasonable doubt guilty,

00:23.200 --> 00:26.040
but the jurors also think he shouldn't be punished.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.840
The jury can nullify the law and let him go free.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.760
But before you're on your next jury and yell,

00:30.760 --> 00:35.240
NUL BOOYAH at the judge, you should know that just talking about jury nullification

00:35.240 --> 00:37.720
in the wrong circumstances can get you arrested.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.840
Though a video such as this one simply acknowledging the existence of jury nullification

00:41.840 --> 00:44.840
and in no way advocating it is totally okay.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.000
And while we're at it,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.800
CGP Grey is not a lawyer, this is not legal advice,

00:47.800 --> 00:49.800
this is meant for entertainment purposes only, seriously guy,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.800
don't do anything in a court of law based on what an internet video told you, no joke.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.040
So why can't you do this?

00:54.040 --> 00:56.120
It's because nullification isn't in the law,

00:56.120 --> 00:59.400
but exists as a logical consequence of two other laws.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.720
First, the juries can't be punished for a wrong decision

01:01.720 --> 01:05.040
no matter what the witnesses, DNA evidence, or video proof show.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.840
That's the point of a jury, to be the final decider.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.080
And second, when a defendant is found not guilty,

01:10.080 --> 01:13.240
that defendant can't be tried again for the same crime.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.080
So there are only two stated options, guilty or not,

01:16.080 --> 01:20.160
it's just that jury nullification is when the words of the jurors don't match their thoughts,

01:20.160 --> 01:24.160
for which they can't be punished and their not guilty decision can't be changed.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.120
These laws are necessary for juries to exist within a fair system,

01:27.120 --> 01:29.600
but the logical consequence is contentious.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.840
Lawyers and judges argue about jury nullification

01:31.840 --> 01:34.120
like physicists argue about quantum mechanics.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.880
Both are difficult to observe, and the interpretation of both

01:36.880 --> 01:40.800
has a huge philosophical ramification for the subject as a whole.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.120
Is jury nullification the righteous will of the people,

01:43.120 --> 01:46.640
or an anarchy of twelve, or just how citizens judge their laws?

01:46.640 --> 01:50.080
The go-to example in favor of nullification is the Fugitive Slave Law,

01:50.080 --> 01:53.360
when northern juries refuse to convict escaped slaves and set them free.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.240
Can't argue with that.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.240
But the anarchy side is southern juries refusing to convict lynch mobs,

01:58.240 --> 02:00.160
not humanity at its best.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.080
But both of these are juries nullifying the law.

02:03.080 --> 02:07.480
And also, juries have two options for where their thoughts may differ from their words.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.360
Jury nullification usually refers to the non-guilty version,

02:10.360 --> 02:14.840
but juries can convict without evidence just as easily as they can acquit in spite of it.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.640
This is jury nullification too, and the jurors are protected by the first rule,

02:18.640 --> 02:22.680
though the second doesn't apply, and judges do have the power to overrule a guilty verdict

02:22.680 --> 02:24.840
if they think the jurors aren't the best.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.120
And of course, a guilty defendant can appeal, at least for a little while,

02:28.120 --> 02:32.440
which makes the guilty form of jury nullification weaker than the not-guilty kind.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.400
Cold comfort, though.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.360
Given the possibility of jurors who might ignore the law as written,

02:36.360 --> 02:38.720
it's not surprising when picking jurors for a trial,

02:38.720 --> 02:41.520
lawyers, whose existence is dependent on an orderly society,

02:41.520 --> 02:44.840
will ask about nullification usually in the slightly roundabout way.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.160
Do you have any beliefs that might prevent you from making a decision based strictly on the law?

02:48.160 --> 02:51.200
If, after learning about jury nullification, you think it's a good idea,

02:51.200 --> 02:53.000
answer yes and you'll be rejected,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.720
but answer no with the intent to get on the jury to nullify and you've just committed perjury,

02:57.720 --> 02:59.400
technically a federal crime,

02:59.400 --> 03:02.560
which makes the optimal strategy once on a jury to zip it.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.640
But this introduces a problem for jurors who intend to nullify,

03:05.640 --> 03:09.000
telling the other 11 angry men about your position is risky,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.880
which makes nullification as a tool for fixing unjust laws nationwide problematic.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.680
Not to mention about 95% of criminal charges in the United States never make it to trial

03:17.680 --> 03:20.880
and rather end in a plea bargain, but that's a story for another time.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.120
The only question about jury nullification that may matter in the end is if jurors should be told about it,

03:25.120 --> 03:28.320
and the courts are near universal in their decision, no way.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.240
Which, again, might seem self-interested,

03:30.240 --> 03:31.720
courts do depend on the law,

03:31.720 --> 03:35.440
but there's evidence that telling jurors about nullification changes the way they vote

03:35.440 --> 03:37.400
by making evidence less relevant to them,

03:37.400 --> 03:40.400
which isn't surprising, that's what nullification is.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.800
But mock trials also show sympathetic defendants get more non-guilty verdicts

03:43.800 --> 03:46.760
and unsympathetic defendants get more guilty verdicts in front of jurors

03:46.760 --> 03:50.160
who were explicitly told about nullification compared to those who weren't.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.400
Which sounds bad, but it's also easy to imagine situations

03:53.400 --> 03:57.120
where jurors blindly following the law would be terribly unjust.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.880
In the end, righteous will of the people, or anarchy, or citizen lawmaking,

04:00.880 --> 04:02.800
the system leaves you to decide,

04:02.800 --> 04:06.280
but as long as courts are fair, they require these rules,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.200
so jury nullification will always be with us.
