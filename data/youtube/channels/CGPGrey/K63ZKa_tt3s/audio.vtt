00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello internet, I asked for questions and boy did you deliver with more than 7,000 so

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
let's get started.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.600
If you could have 30 of the greatest minds work for 30 years what would you have them

00:08.600 --> 00:09.600
work on?

00:09.600 --> 00:10.600
Immortality.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.320
Aging is a degenerative fatal disease of the genes in the same way Parkinson's is.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.000
We're trying to cure Parkinson's with gene therapy along with leukemia, multiple melanoma

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
and others.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Why not aging?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.800
Well because most people think of getting old and dying as a beautiful part of the life

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
cycle.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
It isn't.

00:23.800 --> 00:27.440
With 30 years of genius we could grasp control of our genetics and gain eternity.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.960
Since you're pro immortality how would you solve overpopulation?

00:29.960 --> 00:33.980
I'm not sold on overpopulation as a problem, birth rates have been going nothing but down

00:33.980 --> 00:37.880
and until we build that Dyson sphere we aren't anywhere near the carrying capacity of the

00:37.880 --> 00:38.880
solar system.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.520
And immortality is exactly the sort of thing that makes crazy long term sustainability

00:42.520 --> 00:43.820
projects possible.

00:43.820 --> 00:44.820
First date ideas?

00:44.820 --> 00:46.960
Scary experiences increase the probability of bonding.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.400
This explains horror movies.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.160
If you want the date to go well, do them.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.320
If you don't, don't.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.360
Why did you move to the UK?

00:52.360 --> 00:56.120
I'm sure I've answered this before but everyone keeps asking so here's the whole story in

00:56.120 --> 00:57.120
one place.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.000
I grew up in the Empire State starting in the suburbs which I didn't like that much

01:00.000 --> 01:03.040
then went to college in the wilds of Upstate which I liked better.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.640
But it wasn't for me forever so next stop Big City.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.520
New York was the obvious choice but because I was raised in its shadow New York felt a

01:10.520 --> 01:12.400
bit like a step backward in life.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.380
I discovered around this time I had Irish dual citizenship through a series of random

01:15.380 --> 01:18.200
events which opened up the EU and her largest city London.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.040
I knew if I didn't live abroad while still free of life's anchors I never would which

01:22.040 --> 01:23.760
made it all the more reason to go.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.760
I applied to an economics masters program in London, was accepted and went and stayed

01:26.800 --> 01:27.960
for more than a decade.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
It turned out great.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.680
When you're leaving school try the adventurous path.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.080
You can always fall back on the known later.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.500
Destin and Brady are simultaneously bitten by venomous snakes.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.920
You have one vial of anti-venom.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.560
Who do you save and why?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.300
Sounds like we're in a dangerous place.

01:41.300 --> 01:45.560
Sounds like I need to keep that anti-venom while I go get help.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.260
As you co-host two podcasts what is it about podcasts that appeals to you?

01:48.260 --> 01:51.920
So I do have two podcasts that I'm putting on the screen now that you should totally

01:51.920 --> 01:53.440
click and go listen to.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.060
YouTube is how I spend most of my work energy despite what you might think from the CGP

01:57.060 --> 02:02.280
Grey Reddit posts but podcasts allow me to with fewer of my hours make lots of hours

02:02.280 --> 02:04.360
of stuff for other people to enjoy.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.880
Ostensibly I'm doing this Q&A because I hit 2 million subscribers but I'm way more impressed

02:08.880 --> 02:13.840
that these short videos according to YouTube have engaged more than a millennia of human

02:13.840 --> 02:14.840
attention.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.320
At least I was impressed until I did some back of the envelope calculations and realized

02:18.320 --> 02:21.900
that the podcast has eaten up three millennia of human attention.

02:21.900 --> 02:26.140
Which makes the time return on my time for podcasting astounding.

02:26.140 --> 02:29.420
So the bottom line is that these projects are rewarding in different ways.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.420
Have you clicked yet?

02:30.420 --> 02:31.420
Go click.

02:31.420 --> 02:32.420
Seriously do it right now.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.460
I'd love to see this number get even bigger.

02:33.460 --> 02:34.900
Do you move your hands while recording?

02:34.900 --> 02:35.900
Of course.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.100
Thoughts on standardized testing?

02:37.100 --> 02:38.820
Standardized tests measure how good you are at school.

02:38.820 --> 02:39.960
Same with your report card.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.900
They don't measure your understanding and once you accept that they're easier to deal

02:43.900 --> 02:44.900
with.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.020
What do you miss most from the early days of the internet?

02:46.020 --> 02:50.460
Modem sounds.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.100
Correct order to view the Star Wars films?

02:52.100 --> 02:53.100
4, 5, 6, 7.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.580
What do you consider success in life?

02:54.580 --> 02:58.260
I measure success by what percent of my time I have control over.

02:58.260 --> 03:02.180
Reaching 100% isn't possible but on average I've been getting closer.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.780
If this is your goal too, beware the money trap.

03:04.780 --> 03:08.700
I've always preferred jobs that earned less if they gave me more time.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.940
Which didn't pay off in the short term but did in the long term.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.580
The holidays are like 80% of the reason I went into teaching.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.060
Any advice for future teachers?

03:16.060 --> 03:17.140
Watch The Dog Whisperer.

03:17.140 --> 03:19.180
I am deadly serious about this.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.620
It's also my advice for new parents.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.220
What do you consider the biggest threat to humanity?

03:22.220 --> 03:25.400
Last Q&A video I mentioned opinions and how to change them.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.700
The hardest changes are the ones where you're invested in the idea.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.420
And I've been a techno-optimist 100% all of my life.

03:32.420 --> 03:37.360
But this book put a real asterisk on that in a way that I didn't want.

03:37.360 --> 03:42.860
And now artificial intelligence is on my near-term threat list in a deeply unwelcome way.

03:42.860 --> 03:47.020
But it would be self-delusional to ignore a convincing argument because I don't want

03:47.020 --> 03:48.020
it to be true.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.580
You can watch more discussion on Hello Internet if you click here.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.580
Techno-optimists beware.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.060
If you couldn't live in the UK anymore where would you move?

03:54.060 --> 03:58.020
In my ideal life I would live in many different places for a year or two at a time but that's

03:58.020 --> 03:59.720
not really practical now.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.580
If I had to pick a new city at this very moment it would be Amsterdam.

04:03.580 --> 04:04.780
Why are you such a fan of the Dutch?

04:04.780 --> 04:07.940
Sincerely a tulip growing windmill building, hogus log eating, container ship moving, ocean

04:07.940 --> 04:08.940
conquering guy.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.300
Answered your own question there.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.460
Regarding humans need not apply, what do you think we should do to prepare ourselves for

04:13.460 --> 04:14.620
mass unemployment?

04:14.620 --> 04:15.960
I don't know.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.380
The kind of automation I worry about is the same kind that creates Star Trek abundance.

04:20.380 --> 04:24.920
The transition from here to there worries me and solutions that would work in this world

04:24.920 --> 04:27.100
might not work in the in-between.

04:27.100 --> 04:32.420
Also I am open to the idea that I may be wrong about automation and many have good arguments

04:32.420 --> 04:33.420
as to why.

04:33.420 --> 04:37.600
Technology decreasing jobs goes against all the data from all the history of all the world's

04:37.600 --> 04:38.600
economies.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.680
But I think we'll find out sooner than most people expect.

04:40.680 --> 04:45.440
Teslas are quasi-automated already and automation of transport is my prediction for the biggest

04:45.440 --> 04:47.440
most visible impact on employment.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.880
Even pizza companies are getting into the auto business.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.520
Which games have you been playing recently?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.380
Way too much Factorio.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.600
Way too much.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.600
Also Grimworld and much to my own surprise American Truck Simulator.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
So relaxing.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.600
I cannot wait for them to add the rest of the states and Canada.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.300
Please can we see your battle station?

05:02.300 --> 05:05.920
It used to look like this but I've just set up a brand new one and it looks like this.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.040
Would you recommend going to university?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
Yeah maybe.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.540
Devil's in the details though.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.760
At one extreme end if you want to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to pursue

05:13.760 --> 05:17.240
a degree in something that ends in studies you'd be better off taking that money and

05:17.240 --> 05:18.240
starting a restaurant.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.320
Don't get me wrong starting a restaurant is a terrible idea but it's a better terrible

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
idea.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.260
On the other end if you live in a country that pays for college and you're getting a

05:26.260 --> 05:29.880
degree in a high paying field that's easy to recommend.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.080
But between those extremes is where difficult decisions lie.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.840
Personally I went to college and took out a loan and got a degree close to this end

05:36.840 --> 05:40.400
of the spectrum but I only felt comfortable doing that because I was also getting a degree

05:40.400 --> 05:42.080
on this end of the spectrum.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.840
Shock surprise this one paid my bills and this one was a nice hobby.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.720
What's a piece of advice you would give to people that are just getting out of college?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.760
Your life is in your hands alone now.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.280
This is the best and worst thing about adulthood.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.000
Would you have eye surgery to get rid of your glasses?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.960
Jesus Christ man have you ever seen eye surgery?

05:58.960 --> 05:59.960
You're awake.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.160
It's your eyes.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.360
I'll consider eye surgery only when I can replace them fully.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.800
Is a hot dog a sandwich?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.680
No obviously not.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.160
Uh maybe?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.120
Which way is the most effective method of car transport?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
Driving on the left or the right?

06:11.160 --> 06:13.400
It doesn't matter only agreement matters.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.960
What is your country in your mind?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.160
Do you consider yourself American or British?

06:17.160 --> 06:21.400
To live abroad is to be constantly reminded of outsider status so I don't feel remotely

06:21.400 --> 06:24.760
British but having lived in the UK for the whole of my adult life however now when I

06:24.760 --> 06:27.680
go back to America it feels like Canada.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.540
Familiar yet foreign?

06:29.540 --> 06:34.120
So I'm a bit homeless but it doesn't matter because people overvalue national identities

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
anyway.

06:35.120 --> 06:40.200
In the end I feel like someone who grew up in America and is just a person in the world.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.680
If you could teach someone something in a minute or less that would benefit them for

06:42.680 --> 06:43.920
the rest of their life what would it be?

06:43.920 --> 06:46.120
Here's a super fast way to iron your clothes.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.120
Don't bother.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.360
Buy clothes that don't need ironing.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.760
I've just saved you hundreds of hours of your life you're welcome.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.960
Do you have a New Year's resolution?

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
If so what?

06:52.960 --> 06:55.480
I think New Year's resolutions are dumb and designed to fail.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.940
I mean how many of you have already totally abandoned your New Year's resolutions?

06:59.940 --> 07:02.280
But I do like themes for the year.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.440
This is my year of less.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.640
You'll need to go to Cortex for a full explanation because it's a bit complicated and not what

07:08.640 --> 07:10.720
it sounds like and I'm still kind of working on it.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.720
What's your handwriting like?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.920
Messy and to the surprise of many, cursive.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.200
How do you handle stress?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.200
Poorly.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.360
My stress management technique is to remove the source.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.280
I'd rather eliminate the problem than get better at dealing with it.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.560
Top five country flags.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.280
It's hard to separate my thoughts on national flags from the countries themselves.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.840
Scrolling through the list I find myself drawn to the Canadian flag, the UK, Germany and

07:29.840 --> 07:32.480
Nordic flags but it's because I like those places.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.480
That said I'm also a sucker for a strong design in the center like Barbados and Kenya.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.720
And most national flags are pretty good if a little safe.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.340
They're no abomination like the state flags.

07:42.340 --> 07:46.400
It's harder to pick the top out of a bunch of mostly good designs as opposed to picking

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
the best out of a pile of poo.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.640
What's the best book you read last year?

07:49.640 --> 07:53.580
I didn't read as many as I would have liked but I'm going to pick So You've Been Publicly

07:53.580 --> 07:55.220
Shamed as my book of the year.

07:55.220 --> 07:59.240
If I designed a school curriculum it would be required reading for the living on the

07:59.240 --> 08:00.280
internet module.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.200
How long did it take you to sort through these questions?

08:02.200 --> 08:03.680
I divide my working time into units.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.440
This unit is 40 minutes long and I spent 5 units over a couple of days looking at the

08:07.440 --> 08:11.120
most upvoted questions and all of the questions in random order and selecting the ones that

08:11.120 --> 08:12.120
interested me.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.240
Then many, many more units writing various drafts.

08:15.240 --> 08:20.080
This script started at a 5,000 boring messy words and got cut to 2,000 hopefully more

08:20.080 --> 08:21.080
interesting words.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.880
And thank you to everyone who submitted questions.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.400
I'm aware that I only got to half a percent of them so we'll have to do this again sometime.
