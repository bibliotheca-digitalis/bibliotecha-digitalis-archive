0	5000	Hello internet, I asked for questions and boy did you deliver with more than 7,000 so
5000	6000	let's get started.
6000	8600	If you could have 30 of the greatest minds work for 30 years what would you have them
8600	9600	work on?
9600	10600	Immortality.
10600	13320	Aging is a degenerative fatal disease of the genes in the same way Parkinson's is.
13320	17000	We're trying to cure Parkinson's with gene therapy along with leukemia, multiple melanoma
17000	18000	and others.
18000	19000	Why not aging?
19000	21800	Well because most people think of getting old and dying as a beautiful part of the life
21800	22800	cycle.
22800	23800	It isn't.
23800	27440	With 30 years of genius we could grasp control of our genetics and gain eternity.
27440	29960	Since you're pro immortality how would you solve overpopulation?
29960	33980	I'm not sold on overpopulation as a problem, birth rates have been going nothing but down
33980	37880	and until we build that Dyson sphere we aren't anywhere near the carrying capacity of the
37880	38880	solar system.
38880	42520	And immortality is exactly the sort of thing that makes crazy long term sustainability
42520	43820	projects possible.
43820	44820	First date ideas?
44820	46960	Scary experiences increase the probability of bonding.
46960	48400	This explains horror movies.
48400	50160	If you want the date to go well, do them.
50160	51320	If you don't, don't.
51320	52360	Why did you move to the UK?
52360	56120	I'm sure I've answered this before but everyone keeps asking so here's the whole story in
56120	57120	one place.
57800	60000	I grew up in the Empire State starting in the suburbs which I didn't like that much
60000	63040	then went to college in the wilds of Upstate which I liked better.
63040	66640	But it wasn't for me forever so next stop Big City.
66640	70520	New York was the obvious choice but because I was raised in its shadow New York felt a
70520	72400	bit like a step backward in life.
72400	75380	I discovered around this time I had Irish dual citizenship through a series of random
75380	78200	events which opened up the EU and her largest city London.
78200	82040	I knew if I didn't live abroad while still free of life's anchors I never would which
82040	83760	made it all the more reason to go.
83760	86760	I applied to an economics masters program in London, was accepted and went and stayed
86800	87960	for more than a decade.
87960	88960	It turned out great.
88960	91680	When you're leaving school try the adventurous path.
91680	94080	You can always fall back on the known later.
94080	96500	Destin and Brady are simultaneously bitten by venomous snakes.
96500	97920	You have one vial of anti-venom.
97920	99560	Who do you save and why?
99560	101300	Sounds like we're in a dangerous place.
101300	105560	Sounds like I need to keep that anti-venom while I go get help.
105560	108260	As you co-host two podcasts what is it about podcasts that appeals to you?
108260	111920	So I do have two podcasts that I'm putting on the screen now that you should totally
111920	113440	click and go listen to.
113440	117060	YouTube is how I spend most of my work energy despite what you might think from the CGP
117060	122280	Grey Reddit posts but podcasts allow me to with fewer of my hours make lots of hours
122280	124360	of stuff for other people to enjoy.
124360	128880	Ostensibly I'm doing this Q&A because I hit 2 million subscribers but I'm way more impressed
128880	133840	that these short videos according to YouTube have engaged more than a millennia of human
133840	134840	attention.
134840	138320	At least I was impressed until I did some back of the envelope calculations and realized
138320	141900	that the podcast has eaten up three millennia of human attention.
141900	146140	Which makes the time return on my time for podcasting astounding.
146140	149420	So the bottom line is that these projects are rewarding in different ways.
149420	150420	Have you clicked yet?
150420	151420	Go click.
151420	152420	Seriously do it right now.
152420	153460	I'd love to see this number get even bigger.
153460	154900	Do you move your hands while recording?
154900	155900	Of course.
155900	157100	Thoughts on standardized testing?
157100	158820	Standardized tests measure how good you are at school.
158820	159960	Same with your report card.
159960	163900	They don't measure your understanding and once you accept that they're easier to deal
163900	164900	with.
164900	166020	What do you miss most from the early days of the internet?
166020	170460	Modem sounds.
170460	172100	Correct order to view the Star Wars films?
172100	173100	4, 5, 6, 7.
173100	174580	What do you consider success in life?
174580	178260	I measure success by what percent of my time I have control over.
178260	182180	Reaching 100% isn't possible but on average I've been getting closer.
182180	184780	If this is your goal too, beware the money trap.
184780	188700	I've always preferred jobs that earned less if they gave me more time.
188700	191940	Which didn't pay off in the short term but did in the long term.
191940	194580	The holidays are like 80% of the reason I went into teaching.
194580	196060	Any advice for future teachers?
196060	197140	Watch The Dog Whisperer.
197140	199180	I am deadly serious about this.
199180	200620	It's also my advice for new parents.
200620	202220	What do you consider the biggest threat to humanity?
202220	205400	Last Q&A video I mentioned opinions and how to change them.
205400	208700	The hardest changes are the ones where you're invested in the idea.
208700	212420	And I've been a techno-optimist 100% all of my life.
212420	217360	But this book put a real asterisk on that in a way that I didn't want.
217360	222860	And now artificial intelligence is on my near-term threat list in a deeply unwelcome way.
222860	227020	But it would be self-delusional to ignore a convincing argument because I don't want
227020	228020	it to be true.
228020	230580	You can watch more discussion on Hello Internet if you click here.
230580	231580	Techno-optimists beware.
231580	234060	If you couldn't live in the UK anymore where would you move?
234060	238020	In my ideal life I would live in many different places for a year or two at a time but that's
238020	239720	not really practical now.
239720	243580	If I had to pick a new city at this very moment it would be Amsterdam.
243580	244780	Why are you such a fan of the Dutch?
244780	247940	Sincerely a tulip growing windmill building, hogus log eating, container ship moving, ocean
247940	248940	conquering guy.
248940	250300	Answered your own question there.
250300	253460	Regarding humans need not apply, what do you think we should do to prepare ourselves for
253460	254620	mass unemployment?
254620	255960	I don't know.
255960	260380	The kind of automation I worry about is the same kind that creates Star Trek abundance.
260380	264920	The transition from here to there worries me and solutions that would work in this world
264920	267100	might not work in the in-between.
267100	272420	Also I am open to the idea that I may be wrong about automation and many have good arguments
272420	273420	as to why.
273420	277600	Technology decreasing jobs goes against all the data from all the history of all the world's
277600	278600	economies.
278600	280680	But I think we'll find out sooner than most people expect.
280680	285440	Teslas are quasi-automated already and automation of transport is my prediction for the biggest
285440	287440	most visible impact on employment.
287440	289880	Even pizza companies are getting into the auto business.
289880	291520	Which games have you been playing recently?
291520	293380	Way too much Factorio.
293380	294600	Way too much.
294600	297600	Also Grimworld and much to my own surprise American Truck Simulator.
297600	298600	So relaxing.
298600	300600	I cannot wait for them to add the rest of the states and Canada.
300600	302300	Please can we see your battle station?
302300	305920	It used to look like this but I've just set up a brand new one and it looks like this.
305920	308040	Would you recommend going to university?
308040	309040	Yeah maybe.
309040	310540	Devil's in the details though.
310540	313760	At one extreme end if you want to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to pursue
313760	317240	a degree in something that ends in studies you'd be better off taking that money and
317240	318240	starting a restaurant.
318240	322320	Don't get me wrong starting a restaurant is a terrible idea but it's a better terrible
322320	323320	idea.
323320	326260	On the other end if you live in a country that pays for college and you're getting a
326260	329880	degree in a high paying field that's easy to recommend.
329880	333080	But between those extremes is where difficult decisions lie.
333080	336840	Personally I went to college and took out a loan and got a degree close to this end
336840	340400	of the spectrum but I only felt comfortable doing that because I was also getting a degree
340400	342080	on this end of the spectrum.
342080	345840	Shock surprise this one paid my bills and this one was a nice hobby.
345840	348720	What's a piece of advice you would give to people that are just getting out of college?
348720	351760	Your life is in your hands alone now.
351760	354280	This is the best and worst thing about adulthood.
354280	356000	Would you have eye surgery to get rid of your glasses?
356000	358960	Jesus Christ man have you ever seen eye surgery?
358960	359960	You're awake.
359960	361160	It's your eyes.
361160	363360	I'll consider eye surgery only when I can replace them fully.
363360	364800	Is a hot dog a sandwich?
364800	366680	No obviously not.
366680	368160	Uh maybe?
368160	370120	Which way is the most effective method of car transport?
370120	371120	Driving on the left or the right?
371160	373400	It doesn't matter only agreement matters.
373400	374960	What is your country in your mind?
374960	377160	Do you consider yourself American or British?
377160	381400	To live abroad is to be constantly reminded of outsider status so I don't feel remotely
381400	384760	British but having lived in the UK for the whole of my adult life however now when I
384760	387680	go back to America it feels like Canada.
387680	389540	Familiar yet foreign?
389540	394120	So I'm a bit homeless but it doesn't matter because people overvalue national identities
394120	395120	anyway.
395120	400200	In the end I feel like someone who grew up in America and is just a person in the world.
400280	402680	If you could teach someone something in a minute or less that would benefit them for
402680	403920	the rest of their life what would it be?
403920	406120	Here's a super fast way to iron your clothes.
406120	407120	Don't bother.
407120	408360	Buy clothes that don't need ironing.
408360	410760	I've just saved you hundreds of hours of your life you're welcome.
410760	411960	Do you have a New Year's resolution?
411960	412960	If so what?
412960	415480	I think New Year's resolutions are dumb and designed to fail.
415480	419940	I mean how many of you have already totally abandoned your New Year's resolutions?
419940	422280	But I do like themes for the year.
422280	424440	This is my year of less.
424440	428640	You'll need to go to Cortex for a full explanation because it's a bit complicated and not what
428640	430720	it sounds like and I'm still kind of working on it.
430720	431720	What's your handwriting like?
431720	433920	Messy and to the surprise of many, cursive.
433920	435200	How do you handle stress?
435200	436200	Poorly.
436200	438360	My stress management technique is to remove the source.
438360	441280	I'd rather eliminate the problem than get better at dealing with it.
441280	442560	Top five country flags.
442560	446280	It's hard to separate my thoughts on national flags from the countries themselves.
446280	449840	Scrolling through the list I find myself drawn to the Canadian flag, the UK, Germany and
449840	452480	Nordic flags but it's because I like those places.
452480	456480	That said I'm also a sucker for a strong design in the center like Barbados and Kenya.
456480	459720	And most national flags are pretty good if a little safe.
459720	462340	They're no abomination like the state flags.
462340	466400	It's harder to pick the top out of a bunch of mostly good designs as opposed to picking
466400	468400	the best out of a pile of poo.
468400	469640	What's the best book you read last year?
469640	473580	I didn't read as many as I would have liked but I'm going to pick So You've Been Publicly
473580	475220	Shamed as my book of the year.
475220	479240	If I designed a school curriculum it would be required reading for the living on the
479240	480280	internet module.
480280	482200	How long did it take you to sort through these questions?
482200	483680	I divide my working time into units.
483680	487440	This unit is 40 minutes long and I spent 5 units over a couple of days looking at the
487440	491120	most upvoted questions and all of the questions in random order and selecting the ones that
491120	492120	interested me.
492120	495240	Then many, many more units writing various drafts.
495240	500080	This script started at a 5,000 boring messy words and got cut to 2,000 hopefully more
500080	501080	interesting words.
501080	502880	And thank you to everyone who submitted questions.
502880	507400	I'm aware that I only got to half a percent of them so we'll have to do this again sometime.
