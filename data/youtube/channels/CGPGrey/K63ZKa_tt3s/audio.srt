1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello internet, I asked for questions and boy did you deliver with more than 7,000 so

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let's get started.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,600
If you could have 30 of the greatest minds work for 30 years what would you have them

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
work on?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
Immortality.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,320
Aging is a degenerative fatal disease of the genes in the same way Parkinson's is.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,000
We're trying to cure Parkinson's with gene therapy along with leukemia, multiple melanoma

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and others.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why not aging?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
Well because most people think of getting old and dying as a beautiful part of the life

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
cycle.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
It isn't.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,440
With 30 years of genius we could grasp control of our genetics and gain eternity.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,960
Since you're pro immortality how would you solve overpopulation?

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,980
I'm not sold on overpopulation as a problem, birth rates have been going nothing but down

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,880
and until we build that Dyson sphere we aren't anywhere near the carrying capacity of the

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
solar system.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,520
And immortality is exactly the sort of thing that makes crazy long term sustainability

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,820
projects possible.

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,820
First date ideas?

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,960
Scary experiences increase the probability of bonding.

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,400
This explains horror movies.

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,160
If you want the date to go well, do them.

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,320
If you don't, don't.

25
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Why did you move to the UK?

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm sure I've answered this before but everyone keeps asking so here's the whole story in

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
one place.

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,000
I grew up in the Empire State starting in the suburbs which I didn't like that much

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,040
then went to college in the wilds of Upstate which I liked better.

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,640
But it wasn't for me forever so next stop Big City.

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,520
New York was the obvious choice but because I was raised in its shadow New York felt a

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,400
bit like a step backward in life.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,380
I discovered around this time I had Irish dual citizenship through a series of random

34
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,200
events which opened up the EU and her largest city London.

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,040
I knew if I didn't live abroad while still free of life's anchors I never would which

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,760
made it all the more reason to go.

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I applied to an economics masters program in London, was accepted and went and stayed

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,960
for more than a decade.

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
It turned out great.

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
When you're leaving school try the adventurous path.

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,080
You can always fall back on the known later.

42
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,500
Destin and Brady are simultaneously bitten by venomous snakes.

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,920
You have one vial of anti-venom.

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,560
Who do you save and why?

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,300
Sounds like we're in a dangerous place.

46
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,560
Sounds like I need to keep that anti-venom while I go get help.

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,260
As you co-host two podcasts what is it about podcasts that appeals to you?

48
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,920
So I do have two podcasts that I'm putting on the screen now that you should totally

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,440
click and go listen to.

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,060
YouTube is how I spend most of my work energy despite what you might think from the CGP

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,280
Grey Reddit posts but podcasts allow me to with fewer of my hours make lots of hours

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,360
of stuff for other people to enjoy.

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,880
Ostensibly I'm doing this Q&A because I hit 2 million subscribers but I'm way more impressed

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,840
that these short videos according to YouTube have engaged more than a millennia of human

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
attention.

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,320
At least I was impressed until I did some back of the envelope calculations and realized

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,900
that the podcast has eaten up three millennia of human attention.

58
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,140
Which makes the time return on my time for podcasting astounding.

59
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,420
So the bottom line is that these projects are rewarding in different ways.

60
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Have you clicked yet?

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,420
Go click.

62
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,420
Seriously do it right now.

63
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,460
I'd love to see this number get even bigger.

64
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,900
Do you move your hands while recording?

65
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
Of course.

66
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,100
Thoughts on standardized testing?

67
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,820
Standardized tests measure how good you are at school.

68
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,960
Same with your report card.

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,900
They don't measure your understanding and once you accept that they're easier to deal

70
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
with.

71
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,020
What do you miss most from the early days of the internet?

72
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,460
Modem sounds.

73
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,100
Correct order to view the Star Wars films?

74
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
4, 5, 6, 7.

75
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,580
What do you consider success in life?

76
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,260
I measure success by what percent of my time I have control over.

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,180
Reaching 100% isn't possible but on average I've been getting closer.

78
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,780
If this is your goal too, beware the money trap.

79
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,700
I've always preferred jobs that earned less if they gave me more time.

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,940
Which didn't pay off in the short term but did in the long term.

81
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,580
The holidays are like 80% of the reason I went into teaching.

82
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,060
Any advice for future teachers?

83
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,140
Watch The Dog Whisperer.

84
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,180
I am deadly serious about this.

85
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,620
It's also my advice for new parents.

86
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,220
What do you consider the biggest threat to humanity?

87
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,400
Last Q&A video I mentioned opinions and how to change them.

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,700
The hardest changes are the ones where you're invested in the idea.

89
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,420
And I've been a techno-optimist 100% all of my life.

90
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,360
But this book put a real asterisk on that in a way that I didn't want.

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,860
And now artificial intelligence is on my near-term threat list in a deeply unwelcome way.

92
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,020
But it would be self-delusional to ignore a convincing argument because I don't want

93
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
it to be true.

94
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,580
You can watch more discussion on Hello Internet if you click here.

95
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Techno-optimists beware.

96
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,060
If you couldn't live in the UK anymore where would you move?

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,020
In my ideal life I would live in many different places for a year or two at a time but that's

98
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,720
not really practical now.

99
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,580
If I had to pick a new city at this very moment it would be Amsterdam.

100
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,780
Why are you such a fan of the Dutch?

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,940
Sincerely a tulip growing windmill building, hogus log eating, container ship moving, ocean

102
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
conquering guy.

103
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,300
Answered your own question there.

104
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,460
Regarding humans need not apply, what do you think we should do to prepare ourselves for

105
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,620
mass unemployment?

106
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,960
I don't know.

107
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,380
The kind of automation I worry about is the same kind that creates Star Trek abundance.

108
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,920
The transition from here to there worries me and solutions that would work in this world

109
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,100
might not work in the in-between.

110
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,420
Also I am open to the idea that I may be wrong about automation and many have good arguments

111
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
as to why.

112
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,600
Technology decreasing jobs goes against all the data from all the history of all the world's

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
economies.

114
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,680
But I think we'll find out sooner than most people expect.

115
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,440
Teslas are quasi-automated already and automation of transport is my prediction for the biggest

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
most visible impact on employment.

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,880
Even pizza companies are getting into the auto business.

118
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,520
Which games have you been playing recently?

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,380
Way too much Factorio.

120
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,600
Way too much.

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Also Grimworld and much to my own surprise American Truck Simulator.

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
So relaxing.

123
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I cannot wait for them to add the rest of the states and Canada.

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,300
Please can we see your battle station?

125
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,920
It used to look like this but I've just set up a brand new one and it looks like this.

126
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,040
Would you recommend going to university?

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Yeah maybe.

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,540
Devil's in the details though.

129
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,760
At one extreme end if you want to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to pursue

130
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,240
a degree in something that ends in studies you'd be better off taking that money and

131
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
starting a restaurant.

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
Don't get me wrong starting a restaurant is a terrible idea but it's a better terrible

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
idea.

134
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,260
On the other end if you live in a country that pays for college and you're getting a

135
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,880
degree in a high paying field that's easy to recommend.

136
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,080
But between those extremes is where difficult decisions lie.

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,840
Personally I went to college and took out a loan and got a degree close to this end

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,400
of the spectrum but I only felt comfortable doing that because I was also getting a degree

139
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,080
on this end of the spectrum.

140
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,840
Shock surprise this one paid my bills and this one was a nice hobby.

141
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,720
What's a piece of advice you would give to people that are just getting out of college?

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,760
Your life is in your hands alone now.

143
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,280
This is the best and worst thing about adulthood.

144
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
Would you have eye surgery to get rid of your glasses?

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Jesus Christ man have you ever seen eye surgery?

146
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
You're awake.

147
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
It's your eyes.

148
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,360
I'll consider eye surgery only when I can replace them fully.

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
Is a hot dog a sandwich?

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
No obviously not.

151
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,160
Uh maybe?

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,120
Which way is the most effective method of car transport?

153
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Driving on the left or the right?

154
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,400
It doesn't matter only agreement matters.

155
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
What is your country in your mind?

156
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,160
Do you consider yourself American or British?

157
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,400
To live abroad is to be constantly reminded of outsider status so I don't feel remotely

158
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,760
British but having lived in the UK for the whole of my adult life however now when I

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,680
go back to America it feels like Canada.

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,540
Familiar yet foreign?

161
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,120
So I'm a bit homeless but it doesn't matter because people overvalue national identities

162
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
anyway.

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,200
In the end I feel like someone who grew up in America and is just a person in the world.

164
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,680
If you could teach someone something in a minute or less that would benefit them for

165
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,920
the rest of their life what would it be?

166
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,120
Here's a super fast way to iron your clothes.

167
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Don't bother.

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
Buy clothes that don't need ironing.

169
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,760
I've just saved you hundreds of hours of your life you're welcome.

170
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,960
Do you have a New Year's resolution?

171
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
If so what?

172
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,480
I think New Year's resolutions are dumb and designed to fail.

173
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,940
I mean how many of you have already totally abandoned your New Year's resolutions?

174
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,280
But I do like themes for the year.

175
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,440
This is my year of less.

176
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,640
You'll need to go to Cortex for a full explanation because it's a bit complicated and not what

177
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,720
it sounds like and I'm still kind of working on it.

178
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
What's your handwriting like?

179
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
Messy and to the surprise of many, cursive.

180
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,200
How do you handle stress?

181
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Poorly.

182
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
My stress management technique is to remove the source.

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,280
I'd rather eliminate the problem than get better at dealing with it.

184
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
Top five country flags.

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,280
It's hard to separate my thoughts on national flags from the countries themselves.

186
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,840
Scrolling through the list I find myself drawn to the Canadian flag, the UK, Germany and

187
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,480
Nordic flags but it's because I like those places.

188
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,480
That said I'm also a sucker for a strong design in the center like Barbados and Kenya.

189
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,720
And most national flags are pretty good if a little safe.

190
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,340
They're no abomination like the state flags.

191
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,400
It's harder to pick the top out of a bunch of mostly good designs as opposed to picking

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
the best out of a pile of poo.

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,640
What's the best book you read last year?

194
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,580
I didn't read as many as I would have liked but I'm going to pick So You've Been Publicly

195
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,220
Shamed as my book of the year.

196
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,240
If I designed a school curriculum it would be required reading for the living on the

197
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,280
internet module.

198
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
How long did it take you to sort through these questions?

199
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,680
I divide my working time into units.

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,440
This unit is 40 minutes long and I spent 5 units over a couple of days looking at the

201
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
most upvoted questions and all of the questions in random order and selecting the ones that

202
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
interested me.

203
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,240
Then many, many more units writing various drafts.

204
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,080
This script started at a 5,000 boring messy words and got cut to 2,000 hopefully more

205
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
interesting words.

206
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,880
And thank you to everyone who submitted questions.

207
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm aware that I only got to half a percent of them so we'll have to do this again sometime.
