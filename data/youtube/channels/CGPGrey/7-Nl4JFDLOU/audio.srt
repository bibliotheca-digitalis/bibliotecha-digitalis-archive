00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
February is home to one of the most important holidays of the year not to forget, Groundhog

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Day.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,440
If you live outside of Can-Merica then you might not know what a groundhog is, so here

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
you go.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
This is a groundhog.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,920
They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who dig burrows underground.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,940
Burrows large enough in fact to occasionally make their comfy home a structural hazard

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,280
to your comfy home.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,780
This explains the first half of their name.

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,300
The second half is because they're kind of fat, though unlike their fellow Can-Mericans,

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,380
when winter arrives they need their excess weight to go into hibernation.

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,060
The story of the holiday is that on February 2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,140
to peek out of their burrow and look at the world.

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,420
If they see their shadow they go back inside which predicts six more weeks of winter.

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,220
If they don't then spring will come early.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,220
The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania-Dutch custom of weather prediction and today is

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,860
celebrated in Canada and 49 of the 50 states.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,860
The exception being Alaska which, in 2009, decided to forego Groundhog Day in favor of

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,220
Marmot Day.

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,220
Outside of Alaska many groundhogs contend with each other to be the king of seasonal

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,780
weather prediction, their main weapon in this war being their delightful names such as Queen

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,140
Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North Carolina, Shubhanakkadi Sam of Nova Scotia, Staten Island

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,260
Chuck from New York, French Creek Freddy in West Virginia and Gus from Athens, Georgia.

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,520
Though this last groundhog is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor, General Beauregard Lee, who

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,500
one must assume has stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,220
home while drinking mint julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again.

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,440
A thousand miles north of the general, Wharton Willie is the Groundhog King of Canada who

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,940
throws an annual party to help him stay on top and make sure that the people keep building

29
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,680
epic statues of him.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,720
But if there could be only one, Punxsutawney Phil would be him.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,020
Not only is his name the most fun to say, but he also has quite a posse of top-hatted

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,260
tuxedoed men who look after him and call themselves the Inner Circle.

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,840
According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been making predictions since the 1880s.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,760
Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this Punxsutawney Phil, who is functionally immortal

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,200
because of a magic life-extending elixir the Inner Circle members prepare for him so that

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,120
he can continue to make predictions and bring in tourist revenue until the end of time.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,160
He also speaks a language called Groundhoggies that only the president of the Inner Circle

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
can understand.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,260
If you think that Groundhog Day is a dumb, pointless holiday, then there are two things

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,260
you should consider.

41
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,840
First, you have no sense of fun.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,180
And second, you better be careful on Groundhog Day, because in addition to their weather-predicting

43
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,840
day jobs, these Groundhogs also have the magic power to trap you in an infinite time loop

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
until you learn to be less of a jerk.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,760
Happy Groundhog Day!
