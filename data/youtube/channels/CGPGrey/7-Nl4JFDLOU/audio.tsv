0	4400	February is home to one of the most important holidays of the year not to forget, Groundhog
4400	5400	Day.
5400	8440	If you live outside of Can-Merica then you might not know what a groundhog is, so here
8440	9440	you go.
9440	10440	This is a groundhog.
10440	13920	They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who dig burrows underground.
13920	16940	Burrows large enough in fact to occasionally make their comfy home a structural hazard
16940	18280	to your comfy home.
18280	19780	This explains the first half of their name.
19780	23300	The second half is because they're kind of fat, though unlike their fellow Can-Mericans,
23300	26380	when winter arrives they need their excess weight to go into hibernation.
26380	30060	The story of the holiday is that on February 2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation
30060	32140	to peek out of their burrow and look at the world.
32140	35420	If they see their shadow they go back inside which predicts six more weeks of winter.
35420	37220	If they don't then spring will come early.
37220	41220	The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania-Dutch custom of weather prediction and today is
41220	43860	celebrated in Canada and 49 of the 50 states.
43860	47860	The exception being Alaska which, in 2009, decided to forego Groundhog Day in favor of
47860	49220	Marmot Day.
49220	52220	Outside of Alaska many groundhogs contend with each other to be the king of seasonal
52220	55780	weather prediction, their main weapon in this war being their delightful names such as Queen
55780	60140	Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North Carolina, Shubhanakkadi Sam of Nova Scotia, Staten Island
60140	64260	Chuck from New York, French Creek Freddy in West Virginia and Gus from Athens, Georgia.
64260	68520	Though this last groundhog is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor, General Beauregard Lee, who
68520	72500	one must assume has stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation
72500	76220	home while drinking mint julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again.
76220	79440	A thousand miles north of the general, Wharton Willie is the Groundhog King of Canada who
79440	82940	throws an annual party to help him stay on top and make sure that the people keep building
82940	84680	epic statues of him.
84680	87720	But if there could be only one, Punxsutawney Phil would be him.
87720	91020	Not only is his name the most fun to say, but he also has quite a posse of top-hatted
91020	94260	tuxedoed men who look after him and call themselves the Inner Circle.
94260	97840	According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been making predictions since the 1880s.
97840	101760	Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this Punxsutawney Phil, who is functionally immortal
101760	105200	because of a magic life-extending elixir the Inner Circle members prepare for him so that
105200	109120	he can continue to make predictions and bring in tourist revenue until the end of time.
109120	112160	He also speaks a language called Groundhoggies that only the president of the Inner Circle
112160	113520	can understand.
113520	116260	If you think that Groundhog Day is a dumb, pointless holiday, then there are two things
116260	117260	you should consider.
117260	118840	First, you have no sense of fun.
118840	122180	And second, you better be careful on Groundhog Day, because in addition to their weather-predicting
122180	125840	day jobs, these Groundhogs also have the magic power to trap you in an infinite time loop
125840	128000	until you learn to be less of a jerk.
128000	128760	Happy Groundhog Day!
