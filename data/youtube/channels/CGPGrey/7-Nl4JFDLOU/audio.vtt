February is home to one of the most important holidays of the year not to forget, Groundhog

00:04.400 --> 00:05.400
Day.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.440
If you live outside of Can-Merica then you might not know what a groundhog is, so here

00:08.440 --> 00:09.440
you go.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.440
This is a groundhog.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.920
They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who dig burrows underground.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.940
Burrows large enough in fact to occasionally make their comfy home a structural hazard

00:16.940 --> 00:18.280
to your comfy home.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.780
This explains the first half of their name.

00:19.780 --> 00:23.300
The second half is because they're kind of fat, though unlike their fellow Can-Mericans,

00:23.300 --> 00:26.380
when winter arrives they need their excess weight to go into hibernation.

00:26.380 --> 00:30.060
The story of the holiday is that on February 2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation

00:30.060 --> 00:32.140
to peek out of their burrow and look at the world.

00:32.140 --> 00:35.420
If they see their shadow they go back inside which predicts six more weeks of winter.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.220
If they don't then spring will come early.

00:37.220 --> 00:41.220
The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania-Dutch custom of weather prediction and today is

00:41.220 --> 00:43.860
celebrated in Canada and 49 of the 50 states.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.860
The exception being Alaska which, in 2009, decided to forego Groundhog Day in favor of

00:47.860 --> 00:49.220
Marmot Day.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.220
Outside of Alaska many groundhogs contend with each other to be the king of seasonal

00:52.220 --> 00:55.780
weather prediction, their main weapon in this war being their delightful names such as Queen

00:55.780 --> 01:00.140
Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North Carolina, Shubhanakkadi Sam of Nova Scotia, Staten Island

01:00.140 --> 01:04.260
Chuck from New York, French Creek Freddy in West Virginia and Gus from Athens, Georgia.

01:04.260 --> 01:08.520
Though this last groundhog is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor, General Beauregard Lee, who

01:08.520 --> 01:12.500
one must assume has stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation

01:12.500 --> 01:16.220
home while drinking mint julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again.

01:16.220 --> 01:19.440
A thousand miles north of the general, Wharton Willie is the Groundhog King of Canada who

01:19.440 --> 01:22.940
throws an annual party to help him stay on top and make sure that the people keep building

01:22.940 --> 01:24.680
epic statues of him.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.720
But if there could be only one, Punxsutawney Phil would be him.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.020
Not only is his name the most fun to say, but he also has quite a posse of top-hatted

01:31.020 --> 01:34.260
tuxedoed men who look after him and call themselves the Inner Circle.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.840
According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been making predictions since the 1880s.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.760
Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this Punxsutawney Phil, who is functionally immortal

01:41.760 --> 01:45.200
because of a magic life-extending elixir the Inner Circle members prepare for him so that

01:45.200 --> 01:49.120
he can continue to make predictions and bring in tourist revenue until the end of time.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.160
He also speaks a language called Groundhoggies that only the president of the Inner Circle

01:52.160 --> 01:53.520
can understand.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.260
If you think that Groundhog Day is a dumb, pointless holiday, then there are two things

01:56.260 --> 01:57.260
you should consider.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.840
First, you have no sense of fun.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.180
And second, you better be careful on Groundhog Day, because in addition to their weather-predicting

02:02.180 --> 02:05.840
day jobs, these Groundhogs also have the magic power to trap you in an infinite time loop

02:05.840 --> 02:08.000
until you learn to be less of a jerk.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.760
Happy Groundhog Day!
