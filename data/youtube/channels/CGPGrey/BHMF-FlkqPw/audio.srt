Hello internet. I'm here to talk about an experiment on the channel.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,880
There's a problem on YouTube. See, down in the comments

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,120
there are so many scam bots and sex bots and sex bots and scam bots.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,520
I don't know what the deal is. It's been a problem for years

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,000
that multiple creators have complained about, and it's only getting worse.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Soon I expect much worse, and I really don't want these videos

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,640
to be a place where scammers can scam.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,640
So I'm experimenting with a solution in the form of a new privilege for Bonnie B's.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,840
As the verified humans that you are actually making these videos happen,

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,120
you alone will be able to post in the comments below.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,080
The official video discussion, which happens over at the Reddit, is unchanged.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,640
They don't have this problem as much.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,720
So if you are a student and thus banned from Patreon, I'll see you over there.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,040
It's where I spend most of my comment time anyway.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,680
Back to YouTube. There is unfortunately no automated way

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,440
to do what I'm trying to accomplish, so every one of you that signs up

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,960
will have to be individually approved by myself or my team,

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,200
which is an admin nightmare, so please be patient while we work this out.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,440
It's not ideal, but right now it's the best solution

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,840
while also raising the visibility in the comments of everyone

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,680
who helps make these videos happen.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,200
And it's an incentive I'm also happy to add with YouTube's ceaseless promotion

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
of shorts over regular videos, which is having a real impact

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,880
on normal long form creators like myself.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,720
So if you've been watching the channel for years

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
and if you've been considering signing up

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
but have never really quite gotten around to it,

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,520
and if and only if you are in a financially stable place,

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,000
perhaps this benefit is the thing that will finally push you over the edge.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
And click here to sign up.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,120
If it does, thank you from me and from my team

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,880
for allowing us to spend an unreasonable amount of time

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,160
working on animated explainers for the internet.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,680
It's an honor.
