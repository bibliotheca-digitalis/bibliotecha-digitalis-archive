Hello internet. I'm here to talk about an experiment on the channel.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.880
There's a problem on YouTube. See, down in the comments

00:05.880 --> 00:10.120
there are so many scam bots and sex bots and sex bots and scam bots.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.520
I don't know what the deal is. It's been a problem for years

00:12.520 --> 00:17.000
that multiple creators have complained about, and it's only getting worse.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.360
Soon I expect much worse, and I really don't want these videos

00:21.360 --> 00:23.640
to be a place where scammers can scam.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.640
So I'm experimenting with a solution in the form of a new privilege for Bonnie B's.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.840
As the verified humans that you are actually making these videos happen,

00:32.840 --> 00:36.120
you alone will be able to post in the comments below.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.080
The official video discussion, which happens over at the Reddit, is unchanged.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.640
They don't have this problem as much.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.720
So if you are a student and thus banned from Patreon, I'll see you over there.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.040
It's where I spend most of my comment time anyway.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.680
Back to YouTube. There is unfortunately no automated way

00:51.680 --> 00:56.440
to do what I'm trying to accomplish, so every one of you that signs up

00:56.440 --> 01:00.960
will have to be individually approved by myself or my team,

01:00.960 --> 01:06.200
which is an admin nightmare, so please be patient while we work this out.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.440
It's not ideal, but right now it's the best solution

01:09.440 --> 01:12.840
while also raising the visibility in the comments of everyone

01:12.840 --> 01:14.680
who helps make these videos happen.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.200
And it's an incentive I'm also happy to add with YouTube's ceaseless promotion

01:19.200 --> 01:23.040
of shorts over regular videos, which is having a real impact

01:23.040 --> 01:25.880
on normal long form creators like myself.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.720
So if you've been watching the channel for years

01:27.720 --> 01:29.720
and if you've been considering signing up

01:29.720 --> 01:32.240
but have never really quite gotten around to it,

01:32.240 --> 01:36.520
and if and only if you are in a financially stable place,

01:36.520 --> 01:40.000
perhaps this benefit is the thing that will finally push you over the edge.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.600
And click here to sign up.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.120
If it does, thank you from me and from my team

01:44.120 --> 01:47.880
for allowing us to spend an unreasonable amount of time

01:47.880 --> 01:51.160
working on animated explainers for the internet.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.680
It's an honor.
