0	3280	Hello internet. I'm here to talk about an experiment on the channel.
3280	5880	There's a problem on YouTube. See, down in the comments
5880	10120	there are so many scam bots and sex bots and sex bots and scam bots.
10120	12520	I don't know what the deal is. It's been a problem for years
12520	17000	that multiple creators have complained about, and it's only getting worse.
17000	21360	Soon I expect much worse, and I really don't want these videos
21360	23640	to be a place where scammers can scam.
23640	28640	So I'm experimenting with a solution in the form of a new privilege for Bonnie B's.
28640	32840	As the verified humans that you are actually making these videos happen,
32840	36120	you alone will be able to post in the comments below.
36120	40080	The official video discussion, which happens over at the Reddit, is unchanged.
40080	41640	They don't have this problem as much.
41640	45720	So if you are a student and thus banned from Patreon, I'll see you over there.
45720	48040	It's where I spend most of my comment time anyway.
48040	51680	Back to YouTube. There is unfortunately no automated way
51680	56440	to do what I'm trying to accomplish, so every one of you that signs up
56440	60960	will have to be individually approved by myself or my team,
60960	66200	which is an admin nightmare, so please be patient while we work this out.
66200	69440	It's not ideal, but right now it's the best solution
69440	72840	while also raising the visibility in the comments of everyone
72840	74680	who helps make these videos happen.
74680	79200	And it's an incentive I'm also happy to add with YouTube's ceaseless promotion
79200	83040	of shorts over regular videos, which is having a real impact
83040	85880	on normal long form creators like myself.
85880	87720	So if you've been watching the channel for years
87720	89720	and if you've been considering signing up
89720	92240	but have never really quite gotten around to it,
92240	96520	and if and only if you are in a financially stable place,
96520	100000	perhaps this benefit is the thing that will finally push you over the edge.
100000	101600	And click here to sign up.
101600	104120	If it does, thank you from me and from my team
104120	107880	for allowing us to spend an unreasonable amount of time
107880	111160	working on animated explainers for the internet.
111160	112680	It's an honor.
