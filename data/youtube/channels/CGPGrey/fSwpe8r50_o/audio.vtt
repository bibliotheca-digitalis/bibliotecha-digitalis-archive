00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
This is the theme system journal.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.600
It's something I helped design for me, and maybe for you,

00:05.600 --> 00:08.300
to help improve my life in a practical way.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.000
It's a very flexible tool.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.400
There are intentionally almost no labels of what has to go where,

00:13.400 --> 00:15.100
so it can be adaptable.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.800
But people ask exactly how I use mine,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.600
so let me show you the specifics,

00:19.600 --> 00:22.200
and then you can see if this journal exactly,

00:22.200 --> 00:25.800
or just the system in general on anything, might work for you.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.200
Rather than start at the beginning, which contains the actual theme part,

00:29.200 --> 00:32.400
I usually start at the back with these boxes and circles,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.500
which are daily trackers of what you want to improve upon,

00:35.500 --> 00:37.600
or, as is often the case with me,

00:37.600 --> 00:40.500
at least what you want to be more consistent about.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.800
So this is where what you want to track happens,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.900
but you don't know what's on your mind before you think about it,

00:45.900 --> 00:48.100
so there are these blank pages next door

00:48.100 --> 00:50.800
to brainstorm on what you might want to improve,

00:50.800 --> 00:54.600
and test out how to phrase what to put in the daily tracker slots.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.400
Personally, I find the process of thinking about what needs to be improved,

00:58.400 --> 01:00.500
or changed, or constantified,

01:00.500 --> 01:03.300
one of the most directly helpful parts of the process,

01:03.300 --> 01:05.900
identifying vague feelings of dissatisfaction

01:05.900 --> 01:10.100
and turning them into actionable, tractionable, checklistable items.

01:10.100 --> 01:14.500
For me, the brainstorm pages usually end up with the big four that can go wrong.

01:14.500 --> 01:18.900
Sleep, exercise, diet, work, plus a few other things on my mind at the time.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.300
For example, I realized over the past couple of years

01:21.300 --> 01:24.800
I've gotten really terrible at human communication.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.600
I mean, I've always been bad at responding to messages,

01:27.600 --> 01:30.800
but it's at new abysmal lows.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.200
Next, the idea is to translate these pages into trackable items for these pages.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.000
I think about the list as top-down in order of importance.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.200
I'm not going to be successful at all things at all times,

01:42.200 --> 01:46.200
so a rank-ordered list is helpful when things aren't going great.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.200
The circles are for filling in progress,

01:48.200 --> 01:52.000
and they have a little line in them so you can give yourself partial credit if you want,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.600
and I really recommend setting easy-peasy partial credit.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.600
Example, for writing, I set the hilariously low

01:59.600 --> 02:02.900
write-anything-at-all as partial credit.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.200
This is motivation to not completely bounce off a day's work.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.400
Ugh, whatever.

02:09.400 --> 02:14.800
The full credit is a more reasonable, but still easy, two full writing sessions in a day.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.800
For exercise, partial credit is five minutes of strength shortly after waking up,

02:18.800 --> 02:20.900
and the full credit is 20 minutes later.

02:20.900 --> 02:24.700
And what I've been toying with so far about that communications problem

02:24.700 --> 02:27.400
is to give myself partial credit for something like

02:27.400 --> 02:31.100
reply to one message from anyone today,

02:31.100 --> 02:35.100
which is something I currently frequently fail to do.

02:35.100 --> 02:39.200
That might sound like a comically low threshold depending on what your life is like,

02:39.200 --> 02:44.000
but I think it also communicates just how bad I've gotten at communication.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.800
I actually suspect this is still going to be quite hard for me.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.400
Questions added, I then fill in the circles as I go,

02:49.400 --> 02:52.300
and be sure to look at it all over at the end of the day.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.000
You can track the dates at the top and, if you really want,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.700
count up the circle sections for bonus points if you like,

02:57.700 --> 03:01.200
but I find the circles themselves pleasingly visual enough.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.800
One of the really helpful things about having a physical journal

03:03.800 --> 03:06.800
is to act as a reminder and nudge at the end of the day

03:06.800 --> 03:10.200
that you're going to want to see more circles filled in than not.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.800
Alright, so that's the daily trackers, but there are also a lot of pages like this.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.500
So how do I use these?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.900
This is the main part of the theme system journal,

03:18.900 --> 03:21.000
and it's the most flexible and open-ended.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.100
I use this at the start of the day, writing down where I am in the header,

03:24.100 --> 03:27.500
and the top two boxes to write two things I'm grateful for,

03:27.500 --> 03:29.300
which I know exactly how that sounds,

03:29.300 --> 03:33.500
but it really is frustrating how effective this is at mood elevation.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.700
I really should make a whole other video about gratitude journaling at some point,

03:36.700 --> 03:40.300
but for now, I'll just say the trick is to be really specific.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.300
So don't write,

03:41.300 --> 03:43.000
I'm grateful for my family.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.700
Write something exactly about one person in particular.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.900
And the real pro trick, if you're using the journal when you're feeling down,

03:49.900 --> 03:53.200
is to leave this bottom box empty until the end of the day,

03:53.200 --> 03:56.600
to write in one thing that went well during the day.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.800
This forces your brain to start to pay attention to all the good things in life,

04:00.800 --> 04:03.400
because it has to remember to save one for later.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.400
Anyway, most of the time, I don't feel the need for that extra step,

04:06.400 --> 04:12.200
so I use the bottom box as a place to write the one absolutely critical action item for the day.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.600
And the big box in the middle for me is where I write down whatever is on my mind in the morning.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.900
This box is by far the least actionable part in some ways,

04:19.900 --> 04:23.200
though it helps over time to see what are reoccurring patterns

04:23.200 --> 04:26.300
that you might want to incorporate into future tracking questions

04:26.300 --> 04:28.500
or into an overarching theme itself.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.900
Which brings me to the theme part of the theme system journal,

04:31.900 --> 04:35.400
where you can set a high-level theme for the year or the season,

04:35.400 --> 04:38.600
like year of intentionality or the spring of novelty,

04:38.600 --> 04:40.900
set ideal outcomes you'd like to aim for,

04:40.900 --> 04:44.000
and align your journaling and questions at the back toward that.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.900
Again, like any single part, it's not necessary or required to use it exactly like this,

04:49.900 --> 04:54.900
though this is the one place where there are labels, because it's a strong recommendation.

04:54.900 --> 04:59.400
A lot of work has gone into making this journal the absolute finest it can be.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.400
I would love, if any of this sounded helpful, for you to buy one and give it a try.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.200
Though I also want to be clear, you don't have to buy this.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.800
I've shown you all the parts, there aren't secrets paywalled in the physical product,

05:12.800 --> 05:15.100
so you can just do this on your own,

05:15.100 --> 05:20.700
and if because of this video you try some parts of this system on a pad of paper and it improves your life,

05:20.700 --> 05:22.200
I will be very happy.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.100
I'll just say that if you do want to have a nice physical object

05:26.100 --> 05:29.200
that has been lovingly designed and tweaked over the years,

05:29.200 --> 05:35.200
I cannot tell you how much time was spent making sure the edges of this progress tab tear just right.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.500
So satisfying.

05:37.500 --> 05:43.200
If you'd like something to sit on your desk or in your bag to help nudge you in the right direction,

05:43.200 --> 05:46.300
then do give the Theme System Journal a try.
