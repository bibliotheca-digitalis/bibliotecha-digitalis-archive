0	2400	This is the theme system journal.
2400	5600	It's something I helped design for me, and maybe for you,
5600	8300	to help improve my life in a practical way.
8300	10000	It's a very flexible tool.
10000	13400	There are intentionally almost no labels of what has to go where,
13400	15100	so it can be adaptable.
15100	17800	But people ask exactly how I use mine,
17800	19600	so let me show you the specifics,
19600	22200	and then you can see if this journal exactly,
22200	25800	or just the system in general on anything, might work for you.
25800	29200	Rather than start at the beginning, which contains the actual theme part,
29200	32400	I usually start at the back with these boxes and circles,
32400	35500	which are daily trackers of what you want to improve upon,
35500	37600	or, as is often the case with me,
37600	40500	at least what you want to be more consistent about.
40500	42800	So this is where what you want to track happens,
42800	45900	but you don't know what's on your mind before you think about it,
45900	48100	so there are these blank pages next door
48100	50800	to brainstorm on what you might want to improve,
50800	54600	and test out how to phrase what to put in the daily tracker slots.
54600	58400	Personally, I find the process of thinking about what needs to be improved,
58400	60500	or changed, or constantified,
60500	63300	one of the most directly helpful parts of the process,
63300	65900	identifying vague feelings of dissatisfaction
65900	70100	and turning them into actionable, tractionable, checklistable items.
70100	74500	For me, the brainstorm pages usually end up with the big four that can go wrong.
74500	78900	Sleep, exercise, diet, work, plus a few other things on my mind at the time.
78900	81300	For example, I realized over the past couple of years
81300	84800	I've gotten really terrible at human communication.
84800	87600	I mean, I've always been bad at responding to messages,
87600	90800	but it's at new abysmal lows.
90800	96200	Next, the idea is to translate these pages into trackable items for these pages.
96200	99000	I think about the list as top-down in order of importance.
99000	102200	I'm not going to be successful at all things at all times,
102200	106200	so a rank-ordered list is helpful when things aren't going great.
106200	108200	The circles are for filling in progress,
108200	112000	and they have a little line in them so you can give yourself partial credit if you want,
112000	116600	and I really recommend setting easy-peasy partial credit.
116600	119600	Example, for writing, I set the hilariously low
119600	122900	write-anything-at-all as partial credit.
122900	126200	This is motivation to not completely bounce off a day's work.
126200	129400	Ugh, whatever.
129400	134800	The full credit is a more reasonable, but still easy, two full writing sessions in a day.
134800	138800	For exercise, partial credit is five minutes of strength shortly after waking up,
138800	140900	and the full credit is 20 minutes later.
140900	144700	And what I've been toying with so far about that communications problem
144700	147400	is to give myself partial credit for something like
147400	151100	reply to one message from anyone today,
151100	155100	which is something I currently frequently fail to do.
155100	159200	That might sound like a comically low threshold depending on what your life is like,
159200	164000	but I think it also communicates just how bad I've gotten at communication.
164000	166800	I actually suspect this is still going to be quite hard for me.
166800	169400	Questions added, I then fill in the circles as I go,
169400	172300	and be sure to look at it all over at the end of the day.
172300	175000	You can track the dates at the top and, if you really want,
175000	177700	count up the circle sections for bonus points if you like,
177700	181200	but I find the circles themselves pleasingly visual enough.
181200	183800	One of the really helpful things about having a physical journal
183800	186800	is to act as a reminder and nudge at the end of the day
186800	190200	that you're going to want to see more circles filled in than not.
190200	194800	Alright, so that's the daily trackers, but there are also a lot of pages like this.
194800	196500	So how do I use these?
196500	198900	This is the main part of the theme system journal,
198900	201000	and it's the most flexible and open-ended.
201000	204100	I use this at the start of the day, writing down where I am in the header,
204100	207500	and the top two boxes to write two things I'm grateful for,
207500	209300	which I know exactly how that sounds,
209300	213500	but it really is frustrating how effective this is at mood elevation.
213500	216700	I really should make a whole other video about gratitude journaling at some point,
216700	220300	but for now, I'll just say the trick is to be really specific.
220300	221300	So don't write,
221300	223000	I'm grateful for my family.
223000	226700	Write something exactly about one person in particular.
226700	229900	And the real pro trick, if you're using the journal when you're feeling down,
229900	233200	is to leave this bottom box empty until the end of the day,
233200	236600	to write in one thing that went well during the day.
236600	240800	This forces your brain to start to pay attention to all the good things in life,
240800	243400	because it has to remember to save one for later.
243400	246400	Anyway, most of the time, I don't feel the need for that extra step,
246400	252200	so I use the bottom box as a place to write the one absolutely critical action item for the day.
252200	256600	And the big box in the middle for me is where I write down whatever is on my mind in the morning.
256600	259900	This box is by far the least actionable part in some ways,
259900	263200	though it helps over time to see what are reoccurring patterns
263200	266300	that you might want to incorporate into future tracking questions
266300	268500	or into an overarching theme itself.
268500	271900	Which brings me to the theme part of the theme system journal,
271900	275400	where you can set a high-level theme for the year or the season,
275400	278600	like year of intentionality or the spring of novelty,
278600	280900	set ideal outcomes you'd like to aim for,
280900	284000	and align your journaling and questions at the back toward that.
284000	289900	Again, like any single part, it's not necessary or required to use it exactly like this,
289900	294900	though this is the one place where there are labels, because it's a strong recommendation.
294900	299400	A lot of work has gone into making this journal the absolute finest it can be.
299400	304400	I would love, if any of this sounded helpful, for you to buy one and give it a try.
304400	308200	Though I also want to be clear, you don't have to buy this.
308200	312800	I've shown you all the parts, there aren't secrets paywalled in the physical product,
312800	315100	so you can just do this on your own,
315100	320700	and if because of this video you try some parts of this system on a pad of paper and it improves your life,
320700	322200	I will be very happy.
322200	326100	I'll just say that if you do want to have a nice physical object
326100	329200	that has been lovingly designed and tweaked over the years,
329200	335200	I cannot tell you how much time was spent making sure the edges of this progress tab tear just right.
336400	337500	So satisfying.
337500	343200	If you'd like something to sit on your desk or in your bag to help nudge you in the right direction,
343200	346300	then do give the Theme System Journal a try.
