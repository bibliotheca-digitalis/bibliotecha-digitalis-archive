1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
This is the theme system journal.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,600
It's something I helped design for me, and maybe for you,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,300
to help improve my life in a practical way.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very flexible tool.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,400
There are intentionally almost no labels of what has to go where,

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
so it can be adaptable.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,800
But people ask exactly how I use mine,

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,600
so let me show you the specifics,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and then you can see if this journal exactly,

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,800
or just the system in general on anything, might work for you.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Rather than start at the beginning, which contains the actual theme part,

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,400
I usually start at the back with these boxes and circles,

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,500
which are daily trackers of what you want to improve upon,

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,600
or, as is often the case with me,

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,500
at least what you want to be more consistent about.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
So this is where what you want to track happens,

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,900
but you don't know what's on your mind before you think about it,

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,100
so there are these blank pages next door

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,800
to brainstorm on what you might want to improve,

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,600
and test out how to phrase what to put in the daily tracker slots.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Personally, I find the process of thinking about what needs to be improved,

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,500
or changed, or constantified,

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,300
one of the most directly helpful parts of the process,

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,900
identifying vague feelings of dissatisfaction

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,100
and turning them into actionable, tractionable, checklistable items.

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,500
For me, the brainstorm pages usually end up with the big four that can go wrong.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,900
Sleep, exercise, diet, work, plus a few other things on my mind at the time.

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,300
For example, I realized over the past couple of years

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,800
I've gotten really terrible at human communication.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,600
I mean, I've always been bad at responding to messages,

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,800
but it's at new abysmal lows.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,200
Next, the idea is to translate these pages into trackable items for these pages.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,000
I think about the list as top-down in order of importance.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,200
I'm not going to be successful at all things at all times,

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
so a rank-ordered list is helpful when things aren't going great.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
The circles are for filling in progress,

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,000
and they have a little line in them so you can give yourself partial credit if you want,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,600
and I really recommend setting easy-peasy partial credit.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Example, for writing, I set the hilariously low

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,900
write-anything-at-all as partial credit.

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,200
This is motivation to not completely bounce off a day's work.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,400
Ugh, whatever.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,800
The full credit is a more reasonable, but still easy, two full writing sessions in a day.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
For exercise, partial credit is five minutes of strength shortly after waking up,

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,900
and the full credit is 20 minutes later.

46
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,700
And what I've been toying with so far about that communications problem

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,400
is to give myself partial credit for something like

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,100
reply to one message from anyone today,

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,100
which is something I currently frequently fail to do.

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,200
That might sound like a comically low threshold depending on what your life is like,

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,000
but I think it also communicates just how bad I've gotten at communication.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,800
I actually suspect this is still going to be quite hard for me.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Questions added, I then fill in the circles as I go,

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,300
and be sure to look at it all over at the end of the day.

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
You can track the dates at the top and, if you really want,

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,700
count up the circle sections for bonus points if you like,

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,200
but I find the circles themselves pleasingly visual enough.

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
One of the really helpful things about having a physical journal

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
is to act as a reminder and nudge at the end of the day

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,200
that you're going to want to see more circles filled in than not.

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Alright, so that's the daily trackers, but there are also a lot of pages like this.

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,500
So how do I use these?

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,900
This is the main part of the theme system journal,

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,000
and it's the most flexible and open-ended.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,100
I use this at the start of the day, writing down where I am in the header,

66
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,500
and the top two boxes to write two things I'm grateful for,

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
which I know exactly how that sounds,

68
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,500
but it really is frustrating how effective this is at mood elevation.

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,700
I really should make a whole other video about gratitude journaling at some point,

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,300
but for now, I'll just say the trick is to be really specific.

71
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
So don't write,

72
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm grateful for my family.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,700
Write something exactly about one person in particular.

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,900
And the real pro trick, if you're using the journal when you're feeling down,

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,200
is to leave this bottom box empty until the end of the day,

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,600
to write in one thing that went well during the day.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,800
This forces your brain to start to pay attention to all the good things in life,

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,400
because it has to remember to save one for later.

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Anyway, most of the time, I don't feel the need for that extra step,

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,200
so I use the bottom box as a place to write the one absolutely critical action item for the day.

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,600
And the big box in the middle for me is where I write down whatever is on my mind in the morning.

82
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,900
This box is by far the least actionable part in some ways,

83
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,200
though it helps over time to see what are reoccurring patterns

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,300
that you might want to incorporate into future tracking questions

85
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,500
or into an overarching theme itself.

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,900
Which brings me to the theme part of the theme system journal,

87
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,400
where you can set a high-level theme for the year or the season,

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,600
like year of intentionality or the spring of novelty,

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,900
set ideal outcomes you'd like to aim for,

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,000
and align your journaling and questions at the back toward that.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,900
Again, like any single part, it's not necessary or required to use it exactly like this,

92
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
though this is the one place where there are labels, because it's a strong recommendation.

93
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,400
A lot of work has gone into making this journal the absolute finest it can be.

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I would love, if any of this sounded helpful, for you to buy one and give it a try.

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Though I also want to be clear, you don't have to buy this.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,800
I've shown you all the parts, there aren't secrets paywalled in the physical product,

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,100
so you can just do this on your own,

98
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,700
and if because of this video you try some parts of this system on a pad of paper and it improves your life,

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,200
I will be very happy.

100
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,100
I'll just say that if you do want to have a nice physical object

101
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,200
that has been lovingly designed and tweaked over the years,

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I cannot tell you how much time was spent making sure the edges of this progress tab tear just right.

103
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,500
So satisfying.

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,200
If you'd like something to sit on your desk or in your bag to help nudge you in the right direction,

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,300
then do give the Theme System Journal a try.
