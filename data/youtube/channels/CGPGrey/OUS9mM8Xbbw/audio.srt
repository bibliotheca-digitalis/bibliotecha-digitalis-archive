1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Ah, Election Day.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,040
When Americans everywhere cast their ballot for the next President of the United States.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,680
Except not really.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,480
Americans don't directly vote for President.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,320
So what's happening on Election Day then?

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,640
It's a bit complicated because of something called the Electoral College.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,520
To keep things simple for now, think of the Electoral College as the collection of 538

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,340
votes that determine who the President of the United States will be.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,740
Why 538?

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,280
Because that's the number of Senators, 100, plus the number of Representatives, 438, in

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Congress.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,440
Why are there 438 Representatives in Congress?

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
Stop asking so many questions right now, we're trying to keep this simple.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,080
These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't given to the citizens directly, but are instead

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,780
divided among the states.

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,280
So how does the Electoral College give out the votes?

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,480
Each state, no matter how populous or not, gets three votes to start.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,960
The remaining votes are given out roughly in proportion to the population of the states.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,480
The more people the state has, the more votes it gets.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,400
Here's a map of the United States showing the voting power each state has by making

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,900
one hexagon equal to one Electoral College vote for President.

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,560
Because Electoral College votes mostly, though not completely, scale with population, it's

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,740
also a map of where people live with a bonus given to the smaller states to make them a

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,220
bit bigger than they would otherwise be.

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,660
In early November, when citizens go to the polls, they aren't voting for President directly,

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,660
but they're really telling their state how they want it to use its electoral votes.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,820
Forty-eight of the 50 states give all their Electoral College votes to the candidate who

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,960
wins a majority in their state.

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,300
Take Florida, for example, which has 29 Electoral College votes.

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,600
If a candidate wins a majority, no matter how small that majority, he gets all the votes.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,360
So the path to the White House is clear.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,560
Win enough majorities in enough states to get more than half of the Electoral College

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
votes and you get to sit at the big desk.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
That wasn't so complicated, you say?

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,800
Well, there were a few details left out.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,120
The Electoral College loves states, but what about the 11 million Americans who don't live

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
in a state?

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,320
What happens to their vote and where are these people hiding?

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,980
There are about 600,000 in the District of Columbia, an area set aside specifically not

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,620
to be a state so that the capital of the country would be free of local politics.

41
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,540
For most of the United States' history, people living in the district didn't get to vote

42
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,540
for President.

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,540
But then, in 1964, the Constitution was amended to give D.C. the same number of votes as the

44
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,560
least populous state, Wyoming.

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,320
So the Electoral College likes D.C., but you know who it doesn't like?

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,460
The territories.

47
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,000
The often-forgotten Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
get no votes from the Electoral College because they aren't states and they don't have a special

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
constitutional amendment to recognize them.

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,520
Which is a bit odd considering they're part of the United States and everyone who lives

51
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,680
there is a citizen, so for most practical purposes they're just like D.C. and 4.4 million

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,300
people live in the territories.

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,360
It might not sound like a lot, but it's more than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont,

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,680
North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska and Delaware combined.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,360
But still, no votes from the Electoral College do they get.

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,300
The whole situation with territories is extra strange when you consider the final group

57
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,380
of Americans who don't live in the states, the 6.3 million Americans who live abroad.

58
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,280
If you're a United States citizen who moves to a foreign country, you can usually send

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,460
a postal vote to the last state that you resided in.

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,680
But if you move within the United States to one of its territories, you lose your right

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,760
to vote for President as long as you live there, making these the only spots on the

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,160
whole earth where Americans are not allowed to vote for President.

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,120
Actually they're the only spots in the whole universe because American astronauts are allowed

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
to vote from space.

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
The last bit of Electoral College complication is the weirdest and has to do with the votes

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
themselves.

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,820
The state of Florida and all the others don't really give votes to a candidate, that's just

68
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,940
a simplified way to think about it because the reality of the situation is odd.

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,700
What citizens are voting for on election day is a group of electors appointed by the political

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,760
parties who choose the President on the citizen's behalf.

71
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,100
The number of votes that a state gets from the Electoral College is actually the number

72
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,260
of electors the state is allowed to send to a collegiate meeting to vote on who the President

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,440
will be.

74
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,480
What makes it odd is that while these electors promise they will vote for President as their

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,400
state citizens want them to, they aren't required to do so.

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Electors are free to vote the way they want.

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,080
While this has never swung an election, 87 times in the past electors have voted against

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,660
the wishes of the very people who elected them.

79
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,760
Why set up this crazy system where a small group of people essentially unknown to the

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,720
general public are the ones who really decide on the President?

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,080
In the 1700s, when the Electoral College was designed, the quickest way to send a piece

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,320
of information was to write it down on a piece of paper, hand it to a guy in a horse, wish

83
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,320
him Godspeed good sir, and hope he didn't get killed by Indians or die of dysentery

84
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,160
along the way.

85
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,600
Because information moved so slowly and because the young country was so big, the idea was

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,080
to send all the electors to Washington where they could have the most up-to-date information

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,360
to make decisions for the people back home who wouldn't know the latest news.

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,560
Though now, when we carry information on beams of light in fiber optic cables rather than

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,480
on the backs of herd animals, this particular aspect of the Electoral College might seem

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,800
a little out of date.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Nonetheless, while most people think that the election for President takes place in

92
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
early November, it doesn't.

93
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,460
That's the election that determines who the electors will be.

94
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,640
The 538 electors who are chosen then meet in early December and they cast the real votes

95
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,480
that determine who is the next President of the United States.
