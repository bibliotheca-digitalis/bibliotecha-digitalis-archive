00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Ah, Election Day.

00:02.400 --> 00:06.040
When Americans everywhere cast their ballot for the next President of the United States.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.680
Except not really.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.480
Americans don't directly vote for President.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.320
So what's happening on Election Day then?

00:11.320 --> 00:14.640
It's a bit complicated because of something called the Electoral College.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.520
To keep things simple for now, think of the Electoral College as the collection of 538

00:18.520 --> 00:21.340
votes that determine who the President of the United States will be.

00:21.340 --> 00:22.740
Why 538?

00:22.740 --> 00:26.280
Because that's the number of Senators, 100, plus the number of Representatives, 438, in

00:26.280 --> 00:27.280
Congress.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.440
Why are there 438 Representatives in Congress?

00:29.440 --> 00:32.000
Stop asking so many questions right now, we're trying to keep this simple.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.080
These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't given to the citizens directly, but are instead

00:36.080 --> 00:37.780
divided among the states.

00:37.780 --> 00:40.280
So how does the Electoral College give out the votes?

00:40.280 --> 00:43.480
Each state, no matter how populous or not, gets three votes to start.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.960
The remaining votes are given out roughly in proportion to the population of the states.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.480
The more people the state has, the more votes it gets.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.400
Here's a map of the United States showing the voting power each state has by making

00:52.400 --> 00:55.900
one hexagon equal to one Electoral College vote for President.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.560
Because Electoral College votes mostly, though not completely, scale with population, it's

00:59.560 --> 01:02.740
also a map of where people live with a bonus given to the smaller states to make them a

01:02.740 --> 01:05.220
bit bigger than they would otherwise be.

01:05.220 --> 01:08.660
In early November, when citizens go to the polls, they aren't voting for President directly,

01:08.660 --> 01:12.660
but they're really telling their state how they want it to use its electoral votes.

01:12.660 --> 01:15.820
Forty-eight of the 50 states give all their Electoral College votes to the candidate who

01:15.820 --> 01:17.960
wins a majority in their state.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.300
Take Florida, for example, which has 29 Electoral College votes.

01:21.300 --> 01:25.600
If a candidate wins a majority, no matter how small that majority, he gets all the votes.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.360
So the path to the White House is clear.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.560
Win enough majorities in enough states to get more than half of the Electoral College

01:30.560 --> 01:32.960
votes and you get to sit at the big desk.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.560
That wasn't so complicated, you say?

01:34.560 --> 01:36.800
Well, there were a few details left out.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.120
The Electoral College loves states, but what about the 11 million Americans who don't live

01:40.120 --> 01:41.120
in a state?

01:41.120 --> 01:43.320
What happens to their vote and where are these people hiding?

01:43.320 --> 01:46.980
There are about 600,000 in the District of Columbia, an area set aside specifically not

01:46.980 --> 01:50.620
to be a state so that the capital of the country would be free of local politics.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.540
For most of the United States' history, people living in the district didn't get to vote

01:53.540 --> 01:54.540
for President.

01:54.540 --> 01:58.540
But then, in 1964, the Constitution was amended to give D.C. the same number of votes as the

01:58.540 --> 02:00.560
least populous state, Wyoming.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.320
So the Electoral College likes D.C., but you know who it doesn't like?

02:03.320 --> 02:04.460
The territories.

02:04.460 --> 02:08.000
The often-forgotten Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands

02:08.000 --> 02:11.520
get no votes from the Electoral College because they aren't states and they don't have a special

02:11.520 --> 02:13.840
constitutional amendment to recognize them.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.520
Which is a bit odd considering they're part of the United States and everyone who lives

02:16.520 --> 02:20.680
there is a citizen, so for most practical purposes they're just like D.C. and 4.4 million

02:20.680 --> 02:22.300
people live in the territories.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.360
It might not sound like a lot, but it's more than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont,

02:25.360 --> 02:28.680
North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska and Delaware combined.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.360
But still, no votes from the Electoral College do they get.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.300
The whole situation with territories is extra strange when you consider the final group

02:34.300 --> 02:38.380
of Americans who don't live in the states, the 6.3 million Americans who live abroad.

02:38.380 --> 02:41.280
If you're a United States citizen who moves to a foreign country, you can usually send

02:41.280 --> 02:43.460
a postal vote to the last state that you resided in.

02:43.460 --> 02:46.680
But if you move within the United States to one of its territories, you lose your right

02:46.680 --> 02:49.760
to vote for President as long as you live there, making these the only spots on the

02:49.760 --> 02:53.160
whole earth where Americans are not allowed to vote for President.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.120
Actually they're the only spots in the whole universe because American astronauts are allowed

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
to vote from space.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.200
The last bit of Electoral College complication is the weirdest and has to do with the votes

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
themselves.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.820
The state of Florida and all the others don't really give votes to a candidate, that's just

03:05.820 --> 03:09.940
a simplified way to think about it because the reality of the situation is odd.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.700
What citizens are voting for on election day is a group of electors appointed by the political

03:13.700 --> 03:16.760
parties who choose the President on the citizen's behalf.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.100
The number of votes that a state gets from the Electoral College is actually the number

03:20.100 --> 03:24.260
of electors the state is allowed to send to a collegiate meeting to vote on who the President

03:24.260 --> 03:25.440
will be.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.480
What makes it odd is that while these electors promise they will vote for President as their

03:28.480 --> 03:32.400
state citizens want them to, they aren't required to do so.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.360
Electors are free to vote the way they want.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.080
While this has never swung an election, 87 times in the past electors have voted against

03:38.080 --> 03:40.660
the wishes of the very people who elected them.

03:40.660 --> 03:43.760
Why set up this crazy system where a small group of people essentially unknown to the

03:43.760 --> 03:46.720
general public are the ones who really decide on the President?

03:46.720 --> 03:50.080
In the 1700s, when the Electoral College was designed, the quickest way to send a piece

03:50.080 --> 03:54.320
of information was to write it down on a piece of paper, hand it to a guy in a horse, wish

03:54.320 --> 03:58.320
him Godspeed good sir, and hope he didn't get killed by Indians or die of dysentery

03:58.320 --> 04:00.160
along the way.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.600
Because information moved so slowly and because the young country was so big, the idea was

04:03.600 --> 04:07.080
to send all the electors to Washington where they could have the most up-to-date information

04:07.080 --> 04:10.360
to make decisions for the people back home who wouldn't know the latest news.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.560
Though now, when we carry information on beams of light in fiber optic cables rather than

04:14.560 --> 04:18.480
on the backs of herd animals, this particular aspect of the Electoral College might seem

04:18.480 --> 04:19.800
a little out of date.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.600
Nonetheless, while most people think that the election for President takes place in

04:22.600 --> 04:24.440
early November, it doesn't.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.460
That's the election that determines who the electors will be.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.640
The 538 electors who are chosen then meet in early December and they cast the real votes

04:31.640 --> 04:34.480
that determine who is the next President of the United States.
