0	2400	Ah, Election Day.
2400	6040	When Americans everywhere cast their ballot for the next President of the United States.
6040	7680	Except not really.
7680	9480	Americans don't directly vote for President.
9480	11320	So what's happening on Election Day then?
11320	14640	It's a bit complicated because of something called the Electoral College.
14640	18520	To keep things simple for now, think of the Electoral College as the collection of 538
18520	21340	votes that determine who the President of the United States will be.
21340	22740	Why 538?
22740	26280	Because that's the number of Senators, 100, plus the number of Representatives, 438, in
26280	27280	Congress.
27280	29440	Why are there 438 Representatives in Congress?
29440	32000	Stop asking so many questions right now, we're trying to keep this simple.
32000	36080	These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't given to the citizens directly, but are instead
36080	37780	divided among the states.
37780	40280	So how does the Electoral College give out the votes?
40280	43480	Each state, no matter how populous or not, gets three votes to start.
43480	46960	The remaining votes are given out roughly in proportion to the population of the states.
46960	49480	The more people the state has, the more votes it gets.
49480	52400	Here's a map of the United States showing the voting power each state has by making
52400	55900	one hexagon equal to one Electoral College vote for President.
55900	59560	Because Electoral College votes mostly, though not completely, scale with population, it's
59560	62740	also a map of where people live with a bonus given to the smaller states to make them a
62740	65220	bit bigger than they would otherwise be.
65220	68660	In early November, when citizens go to the polls, they aren't voting for President directly,
68660	72660	but they're really telling their state how they want it to use its electoral votes.
72660	75820	Forty-eight of the 50 states give all their Electoral College votes to the candidate who
75820	77960	wins a majority in their state.
77960	81300	Take Florida, for example, which has 29 Electoral College votes.
81300	85600	If a candidate wins a majority, no matter how small that majority, he gets all the votes.
85600	87360	So the path to the White House is clear.
87360	90560	Win enough majorities in enough states to get more than half of the Electoral College
90560	92960	votes and you get to sit at the big desk.
92960	94560	That wasn't so complicated, you say?
94560	96800	Well, there were a few details left out.
96800	100120	The Electoral College loves states, but what about the 11 million Americans who don't live
100120	101120	in a state?
101120	103320	What happens to their vote and where are these people hiding?
103320	106980	There are about 600,000 in the District of Columbia, an area set aside specifically not
106980	110620	to be a state so that the capital of the country would be free of local politics.
110620	113540	For most of the United States' history, people living in the district didn't get to vote
113540	114540	for President.
114540	118540	But then, in 1964, the Constitution was amended to give D.C. the same number of votes as the
118540	120560	least populous state, Wyoming.
120560	123320	So the Electoral College likes D.C., but you know who it doesn't like?
123320	124460	The territories.
124460	128000	The often-forgotten Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands
128000	131520	get no votes from the Electoral College because they aren't states and they don't have a special
131520	133840	constitutional amendment to recognize them.
133840	136520	Which is a bit odd considering they're part of the United States and everyone who lives
136520	140680	there is a citizen, so for most practical purposes they're just like D.C. and 4.4 million
140680	142300	people live in the territories.
142300	145360	It might not sound like a lot, but it's more than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont,
145360	148680	North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska and Delaware combined.
148680	151360	But still, no votes from the Electoral College do they get.
151360	154300	The whole situation with territories is extra strange when you consider the final group
154300	158380	of Americans who don't live in the states, the 6.3 million Americans who live abroad.
158380	161280	If you're a United States citizen who moves to a foreign country, you can usually send
161280	163460	a postal vote to the last state that you resided in.
163460	166680	But if you move within the United States to one of its territories, you lose your right
166680	169760	to vote for President as long as you live there, making these the only spots on the
169760	173160	whole earth where Americans are not allowed to vote for President.
173160	176120	Actually they're the only spots in the whole universe because American astronauts are allowed
176120	177120	to vote from space.
177120	181200	The last bit of Electoral College complication is the weirdest and has to do with the votes
181200	182200	themselves.
182200	185820	The state of Florida and all the others don't really give votes to a candidate, that's just
185820	189940	a simplified way to think about it because the reality of the situation is odd.
189940	193700	What citizens are voting for on election day is a group of electors appointed by the political
193700	196760	parties who choose the President on the citizen's behalf.
196760	200100	The number of votes that a state gets from the Electoral College is actually the number
200100	204260	of electors the state is allowed to send to a collegiate meeting to vote on who the President
204260	205440	will be.
205440	208480	What makes it odd is that while these electors promise they will vote for President as their
208480	212400	state citizens want them to, they aren't required to do so.
212400	214360	Electors are free to vote the way they want.
214360	218080	While this has never swung an election, 87 times in the past electors have voted against
218080	220660	the wishes of the very people who elected them.
220660	223760	Why set up this crazy system where a small group of people essentially unknown to the
223760	226720	general public are the ones who really decide on the President?
226720	230080	In the 1700s, when the Electoral College was designed, the quickest way to send a piece
230080	234320	of information was to write it down on a piece of paper, hand it to a guy in a horse, wish
234320	238320	him Godspeed good sir, and hope he didn't get killed by Indians or die of dysentery
238320	240160	along the way.
240160	243600	Because information moved so slowly and because the young country was so big, the idea was
243600	247080	to send all the electors to Washington where they could have the most up-to-date information
247080	250360	to make decisions for the people back home who wouldn't know the latest news.
250360	254560	Though now, when we carry information on beams of light in fiber optic cables rather than
254560	258480	on the backs of herd animals, this particular aspect of the Electoral College might seem
258480	259800	a little out of date.
259800	262600	Nonetheless, while most people think that the election for President takes place in
262600	264440	early November, it doesn't.
264440	267460	That's the election that determines who the electors will be.
267460	271640	The 538 electors who are chosen then meet in early December and they cast the real votes
271640	274480	that determine who is the next President of the United States.
