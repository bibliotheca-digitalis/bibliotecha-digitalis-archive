At the end of my video on misconceptions, I mentioned the supposed fact that people

00:03.540 --> 00:05.700
swallow eight spiders a year while sleeping.

00:05.700 --> 00:08.820
But unlike the other misconceptions in that video, which I explained away, I turned this

00:08.820 --> 00:10.800
one into a cheap joke and left it at that.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.600
This wasn't because it's true, but because the story behind that myth turns out to be

00:13.600 --> 00:14.860
a bit of a mystery.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.740
The first place I remember coming across the eight spiders fact was years ago on the lid

00:17.740 --> 00:18.940
of a Snapple can.

00:18.940 --> 00:21.940
Snapple used to print facts of dubious value on their drinks and, though they've tried

00:21.940 --> 00:25.200
to hide it, the Wayback Machine reveals that eight spiders was one of them.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.900
Take a trip to Snopes.com, the go-to site for debunking urban legends of all kinds,

00:28.900 --> 00:31.380
and sure enough, the eight spiders a year thing is listed.

00:31.380 --> 00:35.300
Scroll down and Snopes says that the story came from Lisa Holst in 1993, when email was

00:35.300 --> 00:39.700
still fairly new for most people and messages with subjects like, re-re-forward-re-re-forward

00:39.700 --> 00:43.060
amazing facts were a higher proportion of network traffic.

00:43.060 --> 00:46.940
Lisa Holst says Snopes wrote an article called Reading is Believing in PC Professional listing

00:46.940 --> 00:50.420
all kinds of made-up facts that people would believe, and eight spiders a year was one

00:50.420 --> 00:51.420
of them.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.440
This, I thought, was the perfect misconception to finish the video, like a little moral on

00:54.440 --> 00:56.340
why you should be less credulous.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.460
Out of interest, I went looking for the article to see what other fake facts she mentioned,

00:59.460 --> 01:00.900
but googling for her brought up nothing.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.340
Well, not literally nothing, but nothing helpful.

01:03.340 --> 01:06.560
Mostly it's other articles debunking the eight spiders myth using the exact same language

01:06.560 --> 01:09.300
as the Snopes article, which looked suspicious.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.500
Intrigued I contacted Snopes myself about their source but got back a form reply.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.940
I don't know if ignoring their contact form is their usual way of doing business, along

01:15.940 --> 01:19.480
with copy-paste blocking and pop-under ads, but it seemed odd for a site dedicated to

01:19.480 --> 01:20.740
exposing the truth.

01:20.740 --> 01:24.140
Further digging yielded other articles about people like myself trying to find Lisa Holst

01:24.140 --> 01:25.980
and verify Snopes' version of the story.

01:25.980 --> 01:29.980
There's a page on Metafilter and Stack Exchange and even a website called AIDSSpiders.com

01:29.980 --> 01:31.180
that went looking for her.

01:31.180 --> 01:34.200
The guy who runs that last one even went so far as to contact the Library of Congress

01:34.200 --> 01:37.440
who said they didn't know of any magazine called PC Professional.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.820
Which leaves us in an odd XKCD kind of mood about Snopes.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.320
If the Lisa Holst version of the story is real, then why can't anyone find any record

01:44.320 --> 01:45.920
of her or her article?

01:45.920 --> 01:48.720
And if it's not real, is it just a mistake on Snopes' part?

01:48.720 --> 01:51.940
If so, why haven't they replied to any of the people who brought it to their attention?

01:51.940 --> 01:54.540
However, perhaps we've gone through the looking glass and the Lisa Holst made up the

01:54.540 --> 01:58.700
AIDS Spiders a year fact is the myth, promulgated by none other than Snopes themselves.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.760
It wouldn't be the first time, as Snopes does have a purposely fake article on the site

02:01.760 --> 02:03.980
claiming that Mr. Ed was actually a zebra.

02:03.980 --> 02:07.020
I wasn't able to go any further than this, but if you happen to know anything about Lisa

02:07.020 --> 02:10.540
Holst or the deal with Snopes, please feel free to get in touch or leave a video response.
