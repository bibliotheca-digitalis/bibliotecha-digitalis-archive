00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
At the end of my video on misconceptions, I mentioned the supposed fact that people

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,700
swallow eight spiders a year while sleeping.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,820
But unlike the other misconceptions in that video, which I explained away, I turned this

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,800
one into a cheap joke and left it at that.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
This wasn't because it's true, but because the story behind that myth turns out to be

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,860
a bit of a mystery.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,740
The first place I remember coming across the eight spiders fact was years ago on the lid

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,940
of a Snapple can.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,940
Snapple used to print facts of dubious value on their drinks and, though they've tried

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,200
to hide it, the Wayback Machine reveals that eight spiders was one of them.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Take a trip to Snopes.com, the go-to site for debunking urban legends of all kinds,

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,380
and sure enough, the eight spiders a year thing is listed.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,300
Scroll down and Snopes says that the story came from Lisa Holst in 1993, when email was

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,700
still fairly new for most people and messages with subjects like, re-re-forward-re-re-forward

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,060
amazing facts were a higher proportion of network traffic.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,940
Lisa Holst says Snopes wrote an article called Reading is Believing in PC Professional listing

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,420
all kinds of made-up facts that people would believe, and eight spiders a year was one

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,420
of them.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,440
This, I thought, was the perfect misconception to finish the video, like a little moral on

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,340
why you should be less credulous.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,460
Out of interest, I went looking for the article to see what other fake facts she mentioned,

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,900
but googling for her brought up nothing.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,340
Well, not literally nothing, but nothing helpful.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,560
Mostly it's other articles debunking the eight spiders myth using the exact same language

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,300
as the Snopes article, which looked suspicious.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,500
Intrigued I contacted Snopes myself about their source but got back a form reply.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,940
I don't know if ignoring their contact form is their usual way of doing business, along

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,480
with copy-paste blocking and pop-under ads, but it seemed odd for a site dedicated to

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,740
exposing the truth.

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,140
Further digging yielded other articles about people like myself trying to find Lisa Holst

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,980
and verify Snopes' version of the story.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,980
There's a page on Metafilter and Stack Exchange and even a website called AIDSSpiders.com

33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,180
that went looking for her.

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,200
The guy who runs that last one even went so far as to contact the Library of Congress

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,440
who said they didn't know of any magazine called PC Professional.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,820
Which leaves us in an odd XKCD kind of mood about Snopes.

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,320
If the Lisa Holst version of the story is real, then why can't anyone find any record

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
of her or her article?

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
And if it's not real, is it just a mistake on Snopes' part?

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,940
If so, why haven't they replied to any of the people who brought it to their attention?

41
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,540
However, perhaps we've gone through the looking glass and the Lisa Holst made up the

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,700
AIDS Spiders a year fact is the myth, promulgated by none other than Snopes themselves.

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,760
It wouldn't be the first time, as Snopes does have a purposely fake article on the site

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,980
claiming that Mr. Ed was actually a zebra.

45
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,020
I wasn't able to go any further than this, but if you happen to know anything about Lisa

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,540
Holst or the deal with Snopes, please feel free to get in touch or leave a video response.
