0	3540	At the end of my video on misconceptions, I mentioned the supposed fact that people
3540	5700	swallow eight spiders a year while sleeping.
5700	8820	But unlike the other misconceptions in that video, which I explained away, I turned this
8820	10800	one into a cheap joke and left it at that.
10800	13600	This wasn't because it's true, but because the story behind that myth turns out to be
13600	14860	a bit of a mystery.
14860	17740	The first place I remember coming across the eight spiders fact was years ago on the lid
17740	18940	of a Snapple can.
18940	21940	Snapple used to print facts of dubious value on their drinks and, though they've tried
21940	25200	to hide it, the Wayback Machine reveals that eight spiders was one of them.
25200	28900	Take a trip to Snopes.com, the go-to site for debunking urban legends of all kinds,
28900	31380	and sure enough, the eight spiders a year thing is listed.
31380	35300	Scroll down and Snopes says that the story came from Lisa Holst in 1993, when email was
35300	39700	still fairly new for most people and messages with subjects like, re-re-forward-re-re-forward
39700	43060	amazing facts were a higher proportion of network traffic.
43060	46940	Lisa Holst says Snopes wrote an article called Reading is Believing in PC Professional listing
46940	50420	all kinds of made-up facts that people would believe, and eight spiders a year was one
50420	51420	of them.
51420	54440	This, I thought, was the perfect misconception to finish the video, like a little moral on
54440	56340	why you should be less credulous.
56340	59460	Out of interest, I went looking for the article to see what other fake facts she mentioned,
59460	60900	but googling for her brought up nothing.
60900	63340	Well, not literally nothing, but nothing helpful.
63340	66560	Mostly it's other articles debunking the eight spiders myth using the exact same language
66560	69300	as the Snopes article, which looked suspicious.
69300	72500	Intrigued I contacted Snopes myself about their source but got back a form reply.
72500	75940	I don't know if ignoring their contact form is their usual way of doing business, along
75940	79480	with copy-paste blocking and pop-under ads, but it seemed odd for a site dedicated to
79480	80740	exposing the truth.
80740	84140	Further digging yielded other articles about people like myself trying to find Lisa Holst
84140	85980	and verify Snopes' version of the story.
85980	89980	There's a page on Metafilter and Stack Exchange and even a website called AIDSSpiders.com
89980	91180	that went looking for her.
91180	94200	The guy who runs that last one even went so far as to contact the Library of Congress
94200	97440	who said they didn't know of any magazine called PC Professional.
97440	100820	Which leaves us in an odd XKCD kind of mood about Snopes.
100820	104320	If the Lisa Holst version of the story is real, then why can't anyone find any record
104320	105920	of her or her article?
105920	108720	And if it's not real, is it just a mistake on Snopes' part?
108720	111940	If so, why haven't they replied to any of the people who brought it to their attention?
111940	114540	However, perhaps we've gone through the looking glass and the Lisa Holst made up the
114540	118700	AIDS Spiders a year fact is the myth, promulgated by none other than Snopes themselves.
118700	121760	It wouldn't be the first time, as Snopes does have a purposely fake article on the site
121760	123980	claiming that Mr. Ed was actually a zebra.
123980	127020	I wasn't able to go any further than this, but if you happen to know anything about Lisa
127020	130540	Holst or the deal with Snopes, please feel free to get in touch or leave a video response.
