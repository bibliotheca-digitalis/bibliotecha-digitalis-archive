1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
On the 24th of December every year, children around the world put out milk and cookies

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,060
in the hopes of luring a magic fat man into their home who will leave presents behind

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,140
before sneaking into the house next door.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,860
How did such an odd tradition begin?

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,180
You can pretty much blame Northern Europe where the winter weather is cold and dark

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,180
and depressing.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,220
And the coldest and darkest and depressingest day is the solstice on December 21st or 22nd

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,080
when the sun only gives a few weak hours of light if any at all.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,580
These sun deprived people invented magical characters to visit them and lighten the mood

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,580
by bringing gifts and celebrations.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,160
These characters range from elves to gods to goats but there are two of particular interest

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,420
to the modern story.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,140
The first is Saint Nick in the Netherlands.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,360
Saint Nick is thin and perhaps a bit stern but still brings presents to children in early

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
December.

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,720
He dresses like a bishop in red and white with a staff and rides on a horse named Amerigo

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,600
for whom Dutch children are encouraged to leave out a carrot.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,860
Saint Nick is called Sinterklaas in Dutch.

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,200
The second character is Father Christmas from England.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,400
Father Christmas is a big jolly pagan dressed in green with a holly wreath on his head.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,020
Traditionally he is less concerned with children and gifts than he is with food and wine and

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,320
celebration and is perhaps best known for being one of the three spirits of Christmas

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,140
who terrorize Scrooge.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,280
When Europeans settled the colonies Saint Nick and Father Christmas and the other characters

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,020
began to mix together.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,680
This explains why the US version has so many names.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
Santa Claus is the Americanization of Sinterklaas but he's also called Saint Nick and Father

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,060
Christmas and Kris Kringle which comes from Germany.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,560
In the old world these were different characters but in the new world over time they evolved

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,560
into one which you can see happening in the older stories.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,720
For example the poem The Night Before Christmas came out in 1823 in New York which established

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,460
that Santa lands on the roof and fills stockings with toys.

33
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,700
But this Santa is an elf much like those from Nordic countries.

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,200
He's small and drives a miniature sleigh with tiny reindeer which makes a lot more sense

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,240
for someone whose job description includes fitting down chimneys.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,500
Also the word Santa appears nowhere in the poem.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,140
The original title is a visit from Saint Nick.

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,140
As the 1800s continued a fat human looking immortal Santa evolved into the standard among

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,820
American authors and it was in the States that he gained both his elvish workforce and

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
a wife.

41
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,480
By about 1900 Santa had developed into his current iconic style.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,000
It should be noted that, contrary to popular belief, Coca-Cola didn't change his colors

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,280
to their corporate scheme but instead used the conveniently red and white Santa in 1931

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,540
to help sell more soda during their off season.

45
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,220
Though Coke didn't create him their omnipresent ads probably did brand this as the one true

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,720
Santa in the minds of millions helping spread him around the world to many cultures with

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
no traditions of winter gift givers.

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,120
This American Santa in turn influenced his relations in Northern Europe to become more

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
like him although not always to the pleasure of the locals.

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
In particular the British Father Christmas has been completely assimilated into the Santa

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,600
collective to the point where many Britons don't realize they were ever separate.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,880
In the Netherlands however Saint Nick is still successfully holding his own as a distinct

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
character.

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,640
The one last detail about modern Santa that's still up for debate, at least between countries,

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,280
is exactly where he lives.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,640
In the late 1800s his home was the magnetic north pole centered under the Aurora Borealis.

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,840
While this would be the most diplomatic option for Santa, magnetic north has since moved

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,720
off the polar ice sheet and into the ocean, a rather inconvenient place to set up a toy

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
factory.

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,080
So Canada claims his workshop is somewhere in Nunavut and has given Santa a postcode

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,880
and, no joke, official Canadian citizenship.

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,220
The American response is that the North Pole doesn't refer to the obviously inhospitable

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,280
sheet of non-domestic ice but rather to the little town of North Pole, Alaska.

64
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,680
Denmark claims he lives in their former colony of Greenland and Greenland not surprisingly

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
agrees.

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,860
The Nordic countries quarrel about his exact location but Finland is the clear winner of

67
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,100
this argument with his workshop in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle.

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,620
For the evidence inclined you can actually go visit Santa and see the elves, toys, reindeer

69
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,560
and post office which makes Finland's claim pretty strong.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,900
Santa is even available during the off season.

71
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,220
So no matter where he might be based, Santa still manages to get round the world in just

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,700
one night to deliver all those presents.

73
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,780
And eat all those cookies.
