0	4660	On the 24th of December every year, children around the world put out milk and cookies
4660	8060	in the hopes of luring a magic fat man into their home who will leave presents behind
8060	10140	before sneaking into the house next door.
10140	11860	How did such an odd tradition begin?
11860	15180	You can pretty much blame Northern Europe where the winter weather is cold and dark
15180	16180	and depressing.
16180	20220	And the coldest and darkest and depressingest day is the solstice on December 21st or 22nd
20220	24080	when the sun only gives a few weak hours of light if any at all.
24080	27580	These sun deprived people invented magical characters to visit them and lighten the mood
27580	29580	by bringing gifts and celebrations.
29580	33160	These characters range from elves to gods to goats but there are two of particular interest
33160	34420	to the modern story.
34420	36140	The first is Saint Nick in the Netherlands.
36140	39360	Saint Nick is thin and perhaps a bit stern but still brings presents to children in early
39360	40360	December.
40360	43720	He dresses like a bishop in red and white with a staff and rides on a horse named Amerigo
43720	46600	for whom Dutch children are encouraged to leave out a carrot.
46600	48860	Saint Nick is called Sinterklaas in Dutch.
48860	51200	The second character is Father Christmas from England.
51200	55400	Father Christmas is a big jolly pagan dressed in green with a holly wreath on his head.
55400	59020	Traditionally he is less concerned with children and gifts than he is with food and wine and
59020	62320	celebration and is perhaps best known for being one of the three spirits of Christmas
62320	64140	who terrorize Scrooge.
64140	67280	When Europeans settled the colonies Saint Nick and Father Christmas and the other characters
67280	69020	began to mix together.
69020	71680	This explains why the US version has so many names.
71680	75520	Santa Claus is the Americanization of Sinterklaas but he's also called Saint Nick and Father
75520	78060	Christmas and Kris Kringle which comes from Germany.
78060	81560	In the old world these were different characters but in the new world over time they evolved
81560	84560	into one which you can see happening in the older stories.
84560	88720	For example the poem The Night Before Christmas came out in 1823 in New York which established
88720	91460	that Santa lands on the roof and fills stockings with toys.
91460	94700	But this Santa is an elf much like those from Nordic countries.
94700	98200	He's small and drives a miniature sleigh with tiny reindeer which makes a lot more sense
98200	101240	for someone whose job description includes fitting down chimneys.
101240	103500	Also the word Santa appears nowhere in the poem.
103500	106140	The original title is a visit from Saint Nick.
106140	110140	As the 1800s continued a fat human looking immortal Santa evolved into the standard among
110140	113820	American authors and it was in the States that he gained both his elvish workforce and
113820	114820	a wife.
114820	118480	By about 1900 Santa had developed into his current iconic style.
118480	122000	It should be noted that, contrary to popular belief, Coca-Cola didn't change his colors
122000	126280	to their corporate scheme but instead used the conveniently red and white Santa in 1931
126280	128540	to help sell more soda during their off season.
128540	132220	Though Coke didn't create him their omnipresent ads probably did brand this as the one true
132220	135720	Santa in the minds of millions helping spread him around the world to many cultures with
135720	137720	no traditions of winter gift givers.
137720	141120	This American Santa in turn influenced his relations in Northern Europe to become more
141120	143840	like him although not always to the pleasure of the locals.
143840	147120	In particular the British Father Christmas has been completely assimilated into the Santa
147120	150600	collective to the point where many Britons don't realize they were ever separate.
150600	153880	In the Netherlands however Saint Nick is still successfully holding his own as a distinct
153880	154880	character.
154880	158640	The one last detail about modern Santa that's still up for debate, at least between countries,
158640	160280	is exactly where he lives.
160280	164640	In the late 1800s his home was the magnetic north pole centered under the Aurora Borealis.
164640	167840	While this would be the most diplomatic option for Santa, magnetic north has since moved
167840	171720	off the polar ice sheet and into the ocean, a rather inconvenient place to set up a toy
171720	172720	factory.
172720	176080	So Canada claims his workshop is somewhere in Nunavut and has given Santa a postcode
176080	178880	and, no joke, official Canadian citizenship.
178880	182220	The American response is that the North Pole doesn't refer to the obviously inhospitable
182220	186280	sheet of non-domestic ice but rather to the little town of North Pole, Alaska.
186280	189680	Denmark claims he lives in their former colony of Greenland and Greenland not surprisingly
189680	190680	agrees.
190680	193860	The Nordic countries quarrel about his exact location but Finland is the clear winner of
193860	197100	this argument with his workshop in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle.
197100	200620	For the evidence inclined you can actually go visit Santa and see the elves, toys, reindeer
200620	203560	and post office which makes Finland's claim pretty strong.
203560	205900	Santa is even available during the off season.
205900	209220	So no matter where he might be based, Santa still manages to get round the world in just
209220	211700	one night to deliver all those presents.
211700	212780	And eat all those cookies.
