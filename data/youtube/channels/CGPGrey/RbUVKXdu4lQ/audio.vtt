00:00.000 --> 00:04.660
On the 24th of December every year, children around the world put out milk and cookies

00:04.660 --> 00:08.060
in the hopes of luring a magic fat man into their home who will leave presents behind

00:08.060 --> 00:10.140
before sneaking into the house next door.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.860
How did such an odd tradition begin?

00:11.860 --> 00:15.180
You can pretty much blame Northern Europe where the winter weather is cold and dark

00:15.180 --> 00:16.180
and depressing.

00:16.180 --> 00:20.220
And the coldest and darkest and depressingest day is the solstice on December 21st or 22nd

00:20.220 --> 00:24.080
when the sun only gives a few weak hours of light if any at all.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.580
These sun deprived people invented magical characters to visit them and lighten the mood

00:27.580 --> 00:29.580
by bringing gifts and celebrations.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.160
These characters range from elves to gods to goats but there are two of particular interest

00:33.160 --> 00:34.420
to the modern story.

00:34.420 --> 00:36.140
The first is Saint Nick in the Netherlands.

00:36.140 --> 00:39.360
Saint Nick is thin and perhaps a bit stern but still brings presents to children in early

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
December.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.720
He dresses like a bishop in red and white with a staff and rides on a horse named Amerigo

00:43.720 --> 00:46.600
for whom Dutch children are encouraged to leave out a carrot.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.860
Saint Nick is called Sinterklaas in Dutch.

00:48.860 --> 00:51.200
The second character is Father Christmas from England.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.400
Father Christmas is a big jolly pagan dressed in green with a holly wreath on his head.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.020
Traditionally he is less concerned with children and gifts than he is with food and wine and

00:59.020 --> 01:02.320
celebration and is perhaps best known for being one of the three spirits of Christmas

01:02.320 --> 01:04.140
who terrorize Scrooge.

01:04.140 --> 01:07.280
When Europeans settled the colonies Saint Nick and Father Christmas and the other characters

01:07.280 --> 01:09.020
began to mix together.

01:09.020 --> 01:11.680
This explains why the US version has so many names.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.520
Santa Claus is the Americanization of Sinterklaas but he's also called Saint Nick and Father

01:15.520 --> 01:18.060
Christmas and Kris Kringle which comes from Germany.

01:18.060 --> 01:21.560
In the old world these were different characters but in the new world over time they evolved

01:21.560 --> 01:24.560
into one which you can see happening in the older stories.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.720
For example the poem The Night Before Christmas came out in 1823 in New York which established

01:28.720 --> 01:31.460
that Santa lands on the roof and fills stockings with toys.

01:31.460 --> 01:34.700
But this Santa is an elf much like those from Nordic countries.

01:34.700 --> 01:38.200
He's small and drives a miniature sleigh with tiny reindeer which makes a lot more sense

01:38.200 --> 01:41.240
for someone whose job description includes fitting down chimneys.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.500
Also the word Santa appears nowhere in the poem.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.140
The original title is a visit from Saint Nick.

01:46.140 --> 01:50.140
As the 1800s continued a fat human looking immortal Santa evolved into the standard among

01:50.140 --> 01:53.820
American authors and it was in the States that he gained both his elvish workforce and

01:53.820 --> 01:54.820
a wife.

01:54.820 --> 01:58.480
By about 1900 Santa had developed into his current iconic style.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.000
It should be noted that, contrary to popular belief, Coca-Cola didn't change his colors

02:02.000 --> 02:06.280
to their corporate scheme but instead used the conveniently red and white Santa in 1931

02:06.280 --> 02:08.540
to help sell more soda during their off season.

02:08.540 --> 02:12.220
Though Coke didn't create him their omnipresent ads probably did brand this as the one true

02:12.220 --> 02:15.720
Santa in the minds of millions helping spread him around the world to many cultures with

02:15.720 --> 02:17.720
no traditions of winter gift givers.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.120
This American Santa in turn influenced his relations in Northern Europe to become more

02:21.120 --> 02:23.840
like him although not always to the pleasure of the locals.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.120
In particular the British Father Christmas has been completely assimilated into the Santa

02:27.120 --> 02:30.600
collective to the point where many Britons don't realize they were ever separate.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.880
In the Netherlands however Saint Nick is still successfully holding his own as a distinct

02:33.880 --> 02:34.880
character.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.640
The one last detail about modern Santa that's still up for debate, at least between countries,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.280
is exactly where he lives.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.640
In the late 1800s his home was the magnetic north pole centered under the Aurora Borealis.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.840
While this would be the most diplomatic option for Santa, magnetic north has since moved

02:47.840 --> 02:51.720
off the polar ice sheet and into the ocean, a rather inconvenient place to set up a toy

02:51.720 --> 02:52.720
factory.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.080
So Canada claims his workshop is somewhere in Nunavut and has given Santa a postcode

02:56.080 --> 02:58.880
and, no joke, official Canadian citizenship.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.220
The American response is that the North Pole doesn't refer to the obviously inhospitable

03:02.220 --> 03:06.280
sheet of non-domestic ice but rather to the little town of North Pole, Alaska.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.680
Denmark claims he lives in their former colony of Greenland and Greenland not surprisingly

03:09.680 --> 03:10.680
agrees.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.860
The Nordic countries quarrel about his exact location but Finland is the clear winner of

03:13.860 --> 03:17.100
this argument with his workshop in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.620
For the evidence inclined you can actually go visit Santa and see the elves, toys, reindeer

03:20.620 --> 03:23.560
and post office which makes Finland's claim pretty strong.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.900
Santa is even available during the off season.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.220
So no matter where he might be based, Santa still manages to get round the world in just

03:29.220 --> 03:31.700
one night to deliver all those presents.

03:31.700 --> 03:32.780
And eat all those cookies.
