1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Pandemic season.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,240
This is not the first, nor will it be the last time you lock yourself down.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,480
And we isolate from each other to protect ourselves

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,080
and to protect those more vulnerable than ourselves.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,440
The practical effect of this isolation on you is that your home is no longer your home,

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,320
but has transformed into a vessel that, along with many others,

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,080
has left Earth to orbit around her, alone, together.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,080
Those remaining on Earth have their mission, to mitigate the dangers of the outside.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,280
And while here inside, it may seem like you have naught to do but watch and wait.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,960
Aboard this ship, isolated for a season with length unknown, there are dangers too.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,920
What can start as a break from life will, unchecked, become something much worse.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,760
Darkness and disorder and a slow drift into abyss, where, out here, no one can physically help you.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,200
So you cannot just wait.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,560
Like those below, you above have things to do.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,440
Eventually, Earth will need people to return, to help spin back up the wheels of the human world.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,200
Your mission? Return better than you left.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,640
To accomplish this, you must maintain the vessel.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Welcome aboard Spaceship U.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,120
The core generator of Spaceship U is your health, with two parts, the physical and the mental.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,160
For the ship to stay functional, this generator must spin.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,800
Arriving in orbit, it starts with some momentum to keep things going at first,

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,120
to afford a little time to adjust.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,400
But as with all motion, the passive forces of the universe work to slow that which is active,

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,480
to bring darkness and disorder.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,840
If the core slows too much, if it all drifts too far and becomes too dark,

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,120
recovery on your own is increasingly unlikely.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,560
So, how to prime the core and keep it running during this journey?

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,400
The mental and physical are halves of a whole, so accelerating one accelerates the other.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,040
Each adds to the total momentum, making additional pushing easier,

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,800
priming the core, creating motion, making light and order.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,120
While you could start with either side, if the core is low, prime with the physical half.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
It has sturdier grips.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,080
The mental half, while vital for the higher operations of the ship, is a slipperier place to start.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
You are on your own.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Your brain and how it thinks are all you have.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,160
And brains, when dangerously apathetic or agitated, usually can't just think themselves better.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,280
Brains are complicated messes, but physical activity is simple and brings brains back to baseline.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,880
When the ship is in trouble, prime with the physical.

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
Okay, now what?

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,320
Back in the before time, you may not have noticed how much your physical environment determined what you did.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,720
The library helped you study, the office helped you work, the vacation helped you relax,

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,440
the couch helped you couch.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,000
Then, as now, getting yourself to the right physical space at the right time is a big part of the job of existing.

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
Yet, here you are in one all room.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,160
Thus, the first task is to divide your physical space.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,440
No matter how small your vessel, there will be at least four sides to create four vital stations to operate the ship.

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,240
The first is for exercise.

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,200
Something beyond the bare minimum to survive, so that priming the core is easier when you need to.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,480
Create this simplest station first.

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,520
It doesn't need to be big.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
It doesn't need equipment to start.

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
It just needs to be empty.

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
Your communicator contains more than enough body weight exercises you can start today.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,880
From this point on, crossing this border is how you mentally and physically decide to do the exercise.

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,600
Now, depending on the kind of person you are, exercise will feel like bitter medicine at first.

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,440
Speaking from deep experience here.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,160
But you are on a solo mission in space.

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,160
The generator your life depends on requires physical effort to operate.

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,720
Exercise is non-optional.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,440
While spaceship U is isolated, there are resupplies available.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,720
A small amount of equipment after decontamination can make a big difference.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,480
If your ship is lucky enough to have access to a biosphere, be sure to use that as well.

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,840
Your exercise station is a vital part of returning better than before whatever else might happen on this journey.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,080
The next station to create is sleep.

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,240
Unlike exercise, it's not simple to just lie down and one, two, three, sleep.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:23,600
So, to help this process, you create and respect, even sanctify, the sleep station boundaries as where you go to sleep only.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,320
If you use the sleep station to keep up with social media, or watch stuff, or eat, or all at once,

68
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,760
you degrade the station, degrade your ability to sleep, degrade mission success.

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,000
Maintaining hygiene out here is important.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,280
And the hygiene of the stations is part of that, with sleep hygiene often the most difficult.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,800
Even if you respect the area, your brain may chatter away, not cooperating.

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,520
You can distract it with a sleepy novel, or maybe a sleepy listen.

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,120
But if it does not yield within 30 minutes, leave. Try again later.

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,080
This is where you go to sleep, not to linger, worrying about how you can't.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,000
It will be hard at first, but like exercise, the more you do only the sanctified activity within the sanctified borders,

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,920
the more the sanctified station can help you accomplish what you want.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
And you must get a handle on sleep.

78
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,160
Without the constraints of Earth, you will drift into a random sleep schedule,

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,080
which will make it harder to sleep, which drains the core, which makes everything else harder.

80
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,560
Keep your sleep connected to Earth with an alarm for getting up.

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,160
Again, bitter medicine, but out here, you must create your own structure to accomplish the mission.

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,280
And you can set the alarm for whatever feels right.

83
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,720
It is the consistent waking time that matters, that acts as the psychological anchor point across the coming days.

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
Your mission clock now has a start time with sleep and exercise.

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
But that leaves a lot of open hours. What to do?

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,920
Well, you're probably watching this from your default station, Couch, which comes pre-installed on all vessels.

87
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,200
It's pretty comfy, and NetMe2 Plus does have a tetratrillion hours of streaming video, much of which is amazing.

88
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,400
And you do have a lot of time.

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,440
But, but, you will burn through the list of things you truly enjoy surprisingly fast.

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,800
The stream of streaming looks infinite, but it isn't.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,480
And getting to the effective end of things worth watching is a mixed achievement get.

92
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,280
You'll then have stuff just on, half watching, slumping down, not really paying attention,

93
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,680
perhaps along with some games that can easily eat into the hours and hide the current state of the core,

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,080
such that you don't notice until too late you've started to drift.

95
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Couch contains twin dangers. This laps into lethargy, along with the amping of anxiety.

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,800
When things are bad on Earth, it's natural to want to follow every development, every detail,

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,280
which can descend into a self-irradiation with novel anxieties and angers over that which you cannot affect.

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,640
This unactionable agitation debaselines the brain and drains the core.

99
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Look around you. This is your actionable environment.

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,920
So, take action from Couch. Tidy it and sanctify the boundaries of a new recreation station,

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,280
where you will engage with entertainment you enjoy when actually giving it your full attention.

102
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,800
Or fun that's really fun. Or leisure where you feel better for having done it.

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,880
This is also a good spot to have communicator coffee chats.

104
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,960
Not quite the same as the real thing, but palliative.

105
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,840
And others in their ships are more open to them than you might expect.

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
When it's recreation time, see who is around.

107
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,480
This station should be a refreshing place, but it does have a tendency to become a bit bleh

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,920
and spread out more than the others if left unchecked.

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,640
So, while asleep, you want to schedule consistent time.

110
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,960
With exercise, you need to make sure you're spending a minimum of time.

111
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,720
With recreation, keep an eye on the maximum and the quality of time.

112
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,040
Now, taking action within your radius brings us to the final station, Creation.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,560
Before discussing the inside of this border, recognize you've already done creation outside.

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,480
Creating the environment around yourself to be useful to yourself.

115
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,520
Starting a feedback loop where you affect the environment positively

116
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,040
and the environment positively affects you.

117
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,120
So, while Creation Station will have borders like the others,

118
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,840
the ultimate scope of your potential creation is everything you have the power to affect,

119
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,560
which includes yourself.

120
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,040
It is here where, through work, you can create things humans value,

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,760
through study and research knowledge, through practice, skills.

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,880
Depending on what your Earth work is, you might be able to continue that up here.

123
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,320
If so, you're remotely helping keep the wheels of the world turning

124
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,760
by creating or doing what others value.

125
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,080
If a student, continue learning and expanding and demonstrating your ability to accomplish what is required,

126
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,400
creating and proving your future self.

127
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,880
But if your work or studies can't be done in isolation, you're still going to create something.

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,400
You have all the hours you need to pursue new skills.

129
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,200
To become better at something than you were before.

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,720
Which is how this station keeps the mental half of the core in top shape.

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,800
This station will be the most different depending on who you are and what you want to do or achieve.

132
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,280
Crafts are creation, coding is creation, so is cooking.

133
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,200
This station is up to you, which can be a bit daunting, but one suggestion.

134
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,920
In a funny way, this station is like sleep.

135
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
One, two, three, work doesn't work.

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,720
So just like sleep, keep this station especially hygienic.

137
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,840
Clear of everything except what to focus on.

138
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,000
Crossing the border only to create, not to consume.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,720
Do not watch NetMeToo Plus here, you have a place for that.

140
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,360
If you're too tempted, get up and leave. That's okay.

141
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,440
It's better to be honest and keep the borders strict.

142
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Don't even consume food during creation.

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,760
Go when you need that break, return when you're ready.

144
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,240
Like with sleep, this doesn't happen instantly.

145
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,000
So allow yourself to be a bit bored at the start before slipping into it.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,600
So these are the four stations of the ship.

147
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Make them feel like truly different spaces.

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Then, as the only crew, maintain the stations and the stations will maintain you.

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,120
Each spaceship you is different.

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,120
And figuring out how to best run it over the course of the day, the week, or longer isn't easy.

151
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,360
At times, you will fail and things will get worse. That happens.

152
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,960
But there's no point in berating yourself.

153
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,160
There is only one thing to do. Keep the core spinning.

154
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,600
Complete the mission. Come back better than before.

155
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
See you on Earth, captain.
