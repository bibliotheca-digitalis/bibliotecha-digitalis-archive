0	1040	Pandemic season.
1040	5240	This is not the first, nor will it be the last time you lock yourself down.
5240	8480	And we isolate from each other to protect ourselves
8480	11080	and to protect those more vulnerable than ourselves.
11080	16440	The practical effect of this isolation on you is that your home is no longer your home,
16440	20320	but has transformed into a vessel that, along with many others,
20320	24080	has left Earth to orbit around her, alone, together.
24080	29080	Those remaining on Earth have their mission, to mitigate the dangers of the outside.
29080	34280	And while here inside, it may seem like you have naught to do but watch and wait.
34280	39960	Aboard this ship, isolated for a season with length unknown, there are dangers too.
39960	44920	What can start as a break from life will, unchecked, become something much worse.
44920	52760	Darkness and disorder and a slow drift into abyss, where, out here, no one can physically help you.
52760	54200	So you cannot just wait.
54200	57560	Like those below, you above have things to do.
57560	63440	Eventually, Earth will need people to return, to help spin back up the wheels of the human world.
63440	66200	Your mission? Return better than you left.
66200	69640	To accomplish this, you must maintain the vessel.
69640	72440	Welcome aboard Spaceship U.
72440	78120	The core generator of Spaceship U is your health, with two parts, the physical and the mental.
78120	81160	For the ship to stay functional, this generator must spin.
81160	85800	Arriving in orbit, it starts with some momentum to keep things going at first,
85800	88120	to afford a little time to adjust.
88120	93400	But as with all motion, the passive forces of the universe work to slow that which is active,
93400	95480	to bring darkness and disorder.
95480	100840	If the core slows too much, if it all drifts too far and becomes too dark,
100840	104120	recovery on your own is increasingly unlikely.
104120	107560	So, how to prime the core and keep it running during this journey?
107560	112400	The mental and physical are halves of a whole, so accelerating one accelerates the other.
112400	116040	Each adds to the total momentum, making additional pushing easier,
116040	119800	priming the core, creating motion, making light and order.
119800	125120	While you could start with either side, if the core is low, prime with the physical half.
125120	126680	It has sturdier grips.
126680	132080	The mental half, while vital for the higher operations of the ship, is a slipperier place to start.
132080	133320	You are on your own.
133320	136200	Your brain and how it thinks are all you have.
136200	142160	And brains, when dangerously apathetic or agitated, usually can't just think themselves better.
142160	148280	Brains are complicated messes, but physical activity is simple and brings brains back to baseline.
148280	151880	When the ship is in trouble, prime with the physical.
151880	153280	Okay, now what?
153280	158320	Back in the before time, you may not have noticed how much your physical environment determined what you did.
158320	162720	The library helped you study, the office helped you work, the vacation helped you relax,
162720	164440	the couch helped you couch.
164440	171000	Then, as now, getting yourself to the right physical space at the right time is a big part of the job of existing.
171040	174400	Yet, here you are in one all room.
174400	177160	Thus, the first task is to divide your physical space.
177160	184440	No matter how small your vessel, there will be at least four sides to create four vital stations to operate the ship.
184440	186240	The first is for exercise.
186240	193200	Something beyond the bare minimum to survive, so that priming the core is easier when you need to.
193200	195480	Create this simplest station first.
195480	196520	It doesn't need to be big.
196520	197960	It doesn't need equipment to start.
197960	199280	It just needs to be empty.
199280	204720	Your communicator contains more than enough body weight exercises you can start today.
204720	210880	From this point on, crossing this border is how you mentally and physically decide to do the exercise.
210880	215600	Now, depending on the kind of person you are, exercise will feel like bitter medicine at first.
215600	217440	Speaking from deep experience here.
217440	221160	But you are on a solo mission in space.
221160	226160	The generator your life depends on requires physical effort to operate.
226160	228720	Exercise is non-optional.
228720	232440	While spaceship U is isolated, there are resupplies available.
232440	236720	A small amount of equipment after decontamination can make a big difference.
236720	241480	If your ship is lucky enough to have access to a biosphere, be sure to use that as well.
241480	247840	Your exercise station is a vital part of returning better than before whatever else might happen on this journey.
247840	250080	The next station to create is sleep.
250080	255240	Unlike exercise, it's not simple to just lie down and one, two, three, sleep.
255240	263600	So, to help this process, you create and respect, even sanctify, the sleep station boundaries as where you go to sleep only.
263600	269320	If you use the sleep station to keep up with social media, or watch stuff, or eat, or all at once,
269320	274760	you degrade the station, degrade your ability to sleep, degrade mission success.
274760	277000	Maintaining hygiene out here is important.
277000	282280	And the hygiene of the stations is part of that, with sleep hygiene often the most difficult.
282280	286800	Even if you respect the area, your brain may chatter away, not cooperating.
286800	290520	You can distract it with a sleepy novel, or maybe a sleepy listen.
290520	295120	But if it does not yield within 30 minutes, leave. Try again later.
295120	300080	This is where you go to sleep, not to linger, worrying about how you can't.
300080	307000	It will be hard at first, but like exercise, the more you do only the sanctified activity within the sanctified borders,
307000	310920	the more the sanctified station can help you accomplish what you want.
310920	313200	And you must get a handle on sleep.
313200	317160	Without the constraints of Earth, you will drift into a random sleep schedule,
317160	322080	which will make it harder to sleep, which drains the core, which makes everything else harder.
322080	325560	Keep your sleep connected to Earth with an alarm for getting up.
325560	331160	Again, bitter medicine, but out here, you must create your own structure to accomplish the mission.
331160	334280	And you can set the alarm for whatever feels right.
334280	340720	It is the consistent waking time that matters, that acts as the psychological anchor point across the coming days.
340720	344240	Your mission clock now has a start time with sleep and exercise.
344240	348080	But that leaves a lot of open hours. What to do?
348080	354920	Well, you're probably watching this from your default station, Couch, which comes pre-installed on all vessels.
354920	362200	It's pretty comfy, and NetMe2 Plus does have a tetratrillion hours of streaming video, much of which is amazing.
362200	365400	And you do have a lot of time.
365400	372440	But, but, you will burn through the list of things you truly enjoy surprisingly fast.
372440	375800	The stream of streaming looks infinite, but it isn't.
375800	381480	And getting to the effective end of things worth watching is a mixed achievement get.
381480	387280	You'll then have stuff just on, half watching, slumping down, not really paying attention,
387280	392680	perhaps along with some games that can easily eat into the hours and hide the current state of the core,
392680	397080	such that you don't notice until too late you've started to drift.
397080	402800	Couch contains twin dangers. This laps into lethargy, along with the amping of anxiety.
402800	407800	When things are bad on Earth, it's natural to want to follow every development, every detail,
407800	415280	which can descend into a self-irradiation with novel anxieties and angers over that which you cannot affect.
415280	419640	This unactionable agitation debaselines the brain and drains the core.
419640	422480	Look around you. This is your actionable environment.
422480	427920	So, take action from Couch. Tidy it and sanctify the boundaries of a new recreation station,
427920	433280	where you will engage with entertainment you enjoy when actually giving it your full attention.
433280	437800	Or fun that's really fun. Or leisure where you feel better for having done it.
437800	440880	This is also a good spot to have communicator coffee chats.
440880	443960	Not quite the same as the real thing, but palliative.
443960	447840	And others in their ships are more open to them than you might expect.
447840	450360	When it's recreation time, see who is around.
450360	456480	This station should be a refreshing place, but it does have a tendency to become a bit bleh
456480	459920	and spread out more than the others if left unchecked.
459920	462640	So, while asleep, you want to schedule consistent time.
462640	465960	With exercise, you need to make sure you're spending a minimum of time.
465960	470720	With recreation, keep an eye on the maximum and the quality of time.
470720	476040	Now, taking action within your radius brings us to the final station, Creation.
476040	481560	Before discussing the inside of this border, recognize you've already done creation outside.
481560	485480	Creating the environment around yourself to be useful to yourself.
485480	489520	Starting a feedback loop where you affect the environment positively
489520	492040	and the environment positively affects you.
492040	495120	So, while Creation Station will have borders like the others,
495120	499840	the ultimate scope of your potential creation is everything you have the power to affect,
499840	501560	which includes yourself.
501560	505040	It is here where, through work, you can create things humans value,
505040	508760	through study and research knowledge, through practice, skills.
508760	512880	Depending on what your Earth work is, you might be able to continue that up here.
512880	516320	If so, you're remotely helping keep the wheels of the world turning
516320	518760	by creating or doing what others value.
518760	524080	If a student, continue learning and expanding and demonstrating your ability to accomplish what is required,
524080	526400	creating and proving your future self.
526400	531880	But if your work or studies can't be done in isolation, you're still going to create something.
531880	535400	You have all the hours you need to pursue new skills.
535400	538200	To become better at something than you were before.
538200	542720	Which is how this station keeps the mental half of the core in top shape.
542720	547800	This station will be the most different depending on who you are and what you want to do or achieve.
547800	551280	Crafts are creation, coding is creation, so is cooking.
551280	556200	This station is up to you, which can be a bit daunting, but one suggestion.
556200	558920	In a funny way, this station is like sleep.
558960	562240	One, two, three, work doesn't work.
562240	565720	So just like sleep, keep this station especially hygienic.
565720	568840	Clear of everything except what to focus on.
568840	573000	Crossing the border only to create, not to consume.
573000	576720	Do not watch NetMeToo Plus here, you have a place for that.
576720	580360	If you're too tempted, get up and leave. That's okay.
580360	583440	It's better to be honest and keep the borders strict.
583440	586240	Don't even consume food during creation.
586280	589760	Go when you need that break, return when you're ready.
589760	592240	Like with sleep, this doesn't happen instantly.
592240	597000	So allow yourself to be a bit bored at the start before slipping into it.
597000	599600	So these are the four stations of the ship.
599600	603000	Make them feel like truly different spaces.
603000	608800	Then, as the only crew, maintain the stations and the stations will maintain you.
608800	611120	Each spaceship you is different.
611120	617120	And figuring out how to best run it over the course of the day, the week, or longer isn't easy.
617120	621360	At times, you will fail and things will get worse. That happens.
621360	623960	But there's no point in berating yourself.
623960	628160	There is only one thing to do. Keep the core spinning.
628160	631600	Complete the mission. Come back better than before.
631600	633920	See you on Earth, captain.
