WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.040
Pandemic season.

00:01.040 --> 00:05.240
This is not the first, nor will it be the last time you lock yourself down.

00:05.240 --> 00:08.480
And we isolate from each other to protect ourselves

00:08.480 --> 00:11.080
and to protect those more vulnerable than ourselves.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.440
The practical effect of this isolation on you is that your home is no longer your home,

00:16.440 --> 00:20.320
but has transformed into a vessel that, along with many others,

00:20.320 --> 00:24.080
has left Earth to orbit around her, alone, together.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.080
Those remaining on Earth have their mission, to mitigate the dangers of the outside.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.280
And while here inside, it may seem like you have naught to do but watch and wait.

00:34.280 --> 00:39.960
Aboard this ship, isolated for a season with length unknown, there are dangers too.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.920
What can start as a break from life will, unchecked, become something much worse.

00:44.920 --> 00:52.760
Darkness and disorder and a slow drift into abyss, where, out here, no one can physically help you.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.200
So you cannot just wait.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.560
Like those below, you above have things to do.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.440
Eventually, Earth will need people to return, to help spin back up the wheels of the human world.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.200
Your mission? Return better than you left.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.640
To accomplish this, you must maintain the vessel.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.440
Welcome aboard Spaceship U.

01:12.440 --> 01:18.120
The core generator of Spaceship U is your health, with two parts, the physical and the mental.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.160
For the ship to stay functional, this generator must spin.

01:21.160 --> 01:25.800
Arriving in orbit, it starts with some momentum to keep things going at first,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.120
to afford a little time to adjust.

01:28.120 --> 01:33.400
But as with all motion, the passive forces of the universe work to slow that which is active,

01:33.400 --> 01:35.480
to bring darkness and disorder.

01:35.480 --> 01:40.840
If the core slows too much, if it all drifts too far and becomes too dark,

01:40.840 --> 01:44.120
recovery on your own is increasingly unlikely.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.560
So, how to prime the core and keep it running during this journey?

01:47.560 --> 01:52.400
The mental and physical are halves of a whole, so accelerating one accelerates the other.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.040
Each adds to the total momentum, making additional pushing easier,

01:56.040 --> 01:59.800
priming the core, creating motion, making light and order.

01:59.800 --> 02:05.120
While you could start with either side, if the core is low, prime with the physical half.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.680
It has sturdier grips.

02:06.680 --> 02:12.080
The mental half, while vital for the higher operations of the ship, is a slipperier place to start.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.320
You are on your own.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.200
Your brain and how it thinks are all you have.

02:16.200 --> 02:22.160
And brains, when dangerously apathetic or agitated, usually can't just think themselves better.

02:22.160 --> 02:28.280
Brains are complicated messes, but physical activity is simple and brings brains back to baseline.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.880
When the ship is in trouble, prime with the physical.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.280
Okay, now what?

02:33.280 --> 02:38.320
Back in the before time, you may not have noticed how much your physical environment determined what you did.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.720
The library helped you study, the office helped you work, the vacation helped you relax,

02:42.720 --> 02:44.440
the couch helped you couch.

02:44.440 --> 02:51.000
Then, as now, getting yourself to the right physical space at the right time is a big part of the job of existing.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.400
Yet, here you are in one all room.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.160
Thus, the first task is to divide your physical space.

02:57.160 --> 03:04.440
No matter how small your vessel, there will be at least four sides to create four vital stations to operate the ship.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.240
The first is for exercise.

03:06.240 --> 03:13.200
Something beyond the bare minimum to survive, so that priming the core is easier when you need to.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.480
Create this simplest station first.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.520
It doesn't need to be big.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.960
It doesn't need equipment to start.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.280
It just needs to be empty.

03:19.280 --> 03:24.720
Your communicator contains more than enough body weight exercises you can start today.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.880
From this point on, crossing this border is how you mentally and physically decide to do the exercise.

03:30.880 --> 03:35.600
Now, depending on the kind of person you are, exercise will feel like bitter medicine at first.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.440
Speaking from deep experience here.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.160
But you are on a solo mission in space.

03:41.160 --> 03:46.160
The generator your life depends on requires physical effort to operate.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.720
Exercise is non-optional.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.440
While spaceship U is isolated, there are resupplies available.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.720
A small amount of equipment after decontamination can make a big difference.

03:56.720 --> 04:01.480
If your ship is lucky enough to have access to a biosphere, be sure to use that as well.

04:01.480 --> 04:07.840
Your exercise station is a vital part of returning better than before whatever else might happen on this journey.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.080
The next station to create is sleep.

04:10.080 --> 04:15.240
Unlike exercise, it's not simple to just lie down and one, two, three, sleep.

04:15.240 --> 04:23.600
So, to help this process, you create and respect, even sanctify, the sleep station boundaries as where you go to sleep only.

04:23.600 --> 04:29.320
If you use the sleep station to keep up with social media, or watch stuff, or eat, or all at once,

04:29.320 --> 04:34.760
you degrade the station, degrade your ability to sleep, degrade mission success.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.000
Maintaining hygiene out here is important.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.280
And the hygiene of the stations is part of that, with sleep hygiene often the most difficult.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.800
Even if you respect the area, your brain may chatter away, not cooperating.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.520
You can distract it with a sleepy novel, or maybe a sleepy listen.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.120
But if it does not yield within 30 minutes, leave. Try again later.

04:55.120 --> 05:00.080
This is where you go to sleep, not to linger, worrying about how you can't.

05:00.080 --> 05:07.000
It will be hard at first, but like exercise, the more you do only the sanctified activity within the sanctified borders,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.920
the more the sanctified station can help you accomplish what you want.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.200
And you must get a handle on sleep.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.160
Without the constraints of Earth, you will drift into a random sleep schedule,

05:17.160 --> 05:22.080
which will make it harder to sleep, which drains the core, which makes everything else harder.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.560
Keep your sleep connected to Earth with an alarm for getting up.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.160
Again, bitter medicine, but out here, you must create your own structure to accomplish the mission.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.280
And you can set the alarm for whatever feels right.

05:34.280 --> 05:40.720
It is the consistent waking time that matters, that acts as the psychological anchor point across the coming days.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.240
Your mission clock now has a start time with sleep and exercise.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.080
But that leaves a lot of open hours. What to do?

05:48.080 --> 05:54.920
Well, you're probably watching this from your default station, Couch, which comes pre-installed on all vessels.

05:54.920 --> 06:02.200
It's pretty comfy, and NetMe2 Plus does have a tetratrillion hours of streaming video, much of which is amazing.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.400
And you do have a lot of time.

06:05.400 --> 06:12.440
But, but, you will burn through the list of things you truly enjoy surprisingly fast.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.800
The stream of streaming looks infinite, but it isn't.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.480
And getting to the effective end of things worth watching is a mixed achievement get.

06:21.480 --> 06:27.280
You'll then have stuff just on, half watching, slumping down, not really paying attention,

06:27.280 --> 06:32.680
perhaps along with some games that can easily eat into the hours and hide the current state of the core,

06:32.680 --> 06:37.080
such that you don't notice until too late you've started to drift.

06:37.080 --> 06:42.800
Couch contains twin dangers. This laps into lethargy, along with the amping of anxiety.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.800
When things are bad on Earth, it's natural to want to follow every development, every detail,

06:47.800 --> 06:55.280
which can descend into a self-irradiation with novel anxieties and angers over that which you cannot affect.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.640
This unactionable agitation debaselines the brain and drains the core.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.480
Look around you. This is your actionable environment.

07:02.480 --> 07:07.920
So, take action from Couch. Tidy it and sanctify the boundaries of a new recreation station,

07:07.920 --> 07:13.280
where you will engage with entertainment you enjoy when actually giving it your full attention.

07:13.280 --> 07:17.800
Or fun that's really fun. Or leisure where you feel better for having done it.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.880
This is also a good spot to have communicator coffee chats.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.960
Not quite the same as the real thing, but palliative.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.840
And others in their ships are more open to them than you might expect.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.360
When it's recreation time, see who is around.

07:30.360 --> 07:36.480
This station should be a refreshing place, but it does have a tendency to become a bit bleh

07:36.480 --> 07:39.920
and spread out more than the others if left unchecked.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.640
So, while asleep, you want to schedule consistent time.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.960
With exercise, you need to make sure you're spending a minimum of time.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.720
With recreation, keep an eye on the maximum and the quality of time.

07:50.720 --> 07:56.040
Now, taking action within your radius brings us to the final station, Creation.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.560
Before discussing the inside of this border, recognize you've already done creation outside.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.480
Creating the environment around yourself to be useful to yourself.

08:05.480 --> 08:09.520
Starting a feedback loop where you affect the environment positively

08:09.520 --> 08:12.040
and the environment positively affects you.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.120
So, while Creation Station will have borders like the others,

08:15.120 --> 08:19.840
the ultimate scope of your potential creation is everything you have the power to affect,

08:19.840 --> 08:21.560
which includes yourself.

08:21.560 --> 08:25.040
It is here where, through work, you can create things humans value,

08:25.040 --> 08:28.760
through study and research knowledge, through practice, skills.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.880
Depending on what your Earth work is, you might be able to continue that up here.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.320
If so, you're remotely helping keep the wheels of the world turning

08:36.320 --> 08:38.760
by creating or doing what others value.

08:38.760 --> 08:44.080
If a student, continue learning and expanding and demonstrating your ability to accomplish what is required,

08:44.080 --> 08:46.400
creating and proving your future self.

08:46.400 --> 08:51.880
But if your work or studies can't be done in isolation, you're still going to create something.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.400
You have all the hours you need to pursue new skills.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.200
To become better at something than you were before.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.720
Which is how this station keeps the mental half of the core in top shape.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.800
This station will be the most different depending on who you are and what you want to do or achieve.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.280
Crafts are creation, coding is creation, so is cooking.

09:11.280 --> 09:16.200
This station is up to you, which can be a bit daunting, but one suggestion.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.920
In a funny way, this station is like sleep.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.240
One, two, three, work doesn't work.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.720
So just like sleep, keep this station especially hygienic.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.840
Clear of everything except what to focus on.

09:28.840 --> 09:33.000
Crossing the border only to create, not to consume.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.720
Do not watch NetMeToo Plus here, you have a place for that.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.360
If you're too tempted, get up and leave. That's okay.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.440
It's better to be honest and keep the borders strict.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.240
Don't even consume food during creation.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.760
Go when you need that break, return when you're ready.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.240
Like with sleep, this doesn't happen instantly.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.000
So allow yourself to be a bit bored at the start before slipping into it.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.600
So these are the four stations of the ship.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.000
Make them feel like truly different spaces.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.800
Then, as the only crew, maintain the stations and the stations will maintain you.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.120
Each spaceship you is different.

10:11.120 --> 10:17.120
And figuring out how to best run it over the course of the day, the week, or longer isn't easy.

10:17.120 --> 10:21.360
At times, you will fail and things will get worse. That happens.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.960
But there's no point in berating yourself.

10:23.960 --> 10:28.160
There is only one thing to do. Keep the core spinning.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.600
Complete the mission. Come back better than before.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.920
See you on Earth, captain.

10:41.120 --> 10:47.120
