00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
How to become the British monarch.

00:02.240 --> 00:06.360
Historically, the crown sat upon your head mostly because you had the biggest army.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.440
When you died, your eldest son kept control over that army and so the crown relocated

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
to his head.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.200
Though, of course, someone with a bigger army could change the political landscape quite

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
abruptly.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.500
As time marched on and the world grew less violent, eventually in 1701 parliament established

00:20.500 --> 00:24.900
a set of rules to transfer the crown from one head to another, hopefully with less turmoil

00:24.900 --> 00:26.120
than before.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.320
So here's how the 1701 rules work.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.740
First, don't be Catholic.

00:29.740 --> 00:33.080
The British monarch is also the head of the Church of England to which the monarch must

00:33.080 --> 00:35.340
convert if not already a member.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.180
Except that if you're Catholic, no crown for you.

00:38.180 --> 00:42.260
The history of the royal family and how this rule came to be is a story for another time

00:42.260 --> 00:46.080
but suffice it to say that bigger army diplomacy was involved.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.960
And by the way, no, you can't cleverly get around this rule by converting from Catholicism

00:49.960 --> 00:52.480
to something else and then to Church of England.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.060
In the eyes of the crown, Catholicism is transitive.

00:55.060 --> 00:57.020
Second, don't be a bastard.

00:57.020 --> 01:00.880
Sometimes it's good to be the king but it's never good to be the illegitimate children

01:00.880 --> 01:05.600
of the king who are out of line for the crown from literally the moment of their conception.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.880
If you're related to the monarch but are either a Catholic or a bastard or both, the crown

01:09.880 --> 01:15.060
has the delightful term, naturally dead, to refer to you and your lack of right to succession.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.200
Third, spouses don't count.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.780
While people often think of kings and queens as a pair, that's not the way it works here.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.060
Spouses of monarchs are known as royal consorts.

01:24.060 --> 01:27.860
They may be called prince or queen but as far as the crown is concerned, they're not

01:27.860 --> 01:29.360
in line for the throne.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.060
They're just the matching 23 chromosomes needed for the creation of the real heir.

01:34.060 --> 01:38.860
Fourth and finally, male primo... primogena... primogena whatever.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.860
This is the algorithm of inheritance.

01:40.860 --> 01:45.300
When the monarch dies or abdicates but usually dies, the crown goes to the eldest son who

01:45.300 --> 01:46.740
isn't naturally dead.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.660
If there happens to be an elder daughter, tough luck to her.

01:49.660 --> 01:51.460
Baby brother gets the crown.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.020
It's simple enough but there are non-obvious cases.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.660
Take a king with two sons.

01:55.660 --> 02:00.860
If the eldest dies before the king does, obviously the crown goes to the youngest, now oldest,

02:00.860 --> 02:01.860
brother.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.980
But what if the eldest son gave the king a grandson before death?

02:04.980 --> 02:06.260
Where does the crown go then?

02:06.260 --> 02:10.660
Well, the crown basically pretends that everyone, except the naturally dead, is alive so upon

02:10.660 --> 02:15.040
the death of the king, the crown goes to his eldest son who is now sort of the king who

02:15.040 --> 02:17.160
just really happens to be dead.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.700
So the rule kicks in again and the crown goes to his son, not, as seems obvious now, his

02:21.700 --> 02:22.700
brother.

02:22.700 --> 02:27.100
Now if this 1701 rule means that eldest sons get the crown, how did queens ever come to

02:27.100 --> 02:28.100
be?

02:28.100 --> 02:31.500
Basically, daughters were the last choice of the crown, which is why there have been

02:31.500 --> 02:32.580
so few.

02:32.580 --> 02:36.820
To get the crown, a daughter had to either be the only child of a monarch or the eldest

02:36.820 --> 02:38.900
child without competing brothers.

02:38.900 --> 02:43.980
So pregnant mothers must have made any daughters with queenly aspirations quite nervous.

02:43.980 --> 02:48.680
Now sometimes the branch of a family tree dies out, be it from war or plague or whatever,

02:48.680 --> 02:52.400
so the crown's contingency plan, if it's at a dead end, is to back up one level and

02:52.400 --> 02:56.520
then apply the rules forward again, looking for a living head to sit upon.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.820
If no luck, back up again and repeat and repeat until a living heir is found.

03:01.820 --> 03:03.540
And there will always be an heir.

03:03.540 --> 03:08.300
The first king of England was over a thousand years ago and the mathematics of human reproduction,

03:08.300 --> 03:13.160
backed up by DNA evidence, reveals that just about every European alive is distantly related

03:13.160 --> 03:16.480
to him so the crown will eventually find a way.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.640
So from the first king through the new millennium, the various rules went along, making monarchs,

03:20.640 --> 03:24.600
though with a gender biased result that nobody seemed too bothered about until suddenly in

03:24.600 --> 03:30.240
2013 for no particular reason at all, everyone decided that the rules needed to be updated

03:30.240 --> 03:31.560
right now.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.580
So parliament and the monarchy got together and made some changes, most notably striking

03:35.580 --> 03:38.040
the male part of rule number 4.

03:38.040 --> 03:42.800
From 2013 on, the crown views all royal sons and daughters with equal favour.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.700
The only thing that matters is the order of their birth.

03:45.700 --> 03:50.540
So prior to 2013, the boy and a set of fraternal twins in development could sit back and relax,

03:50.540 --> 03:53.980
secure that the crown would be his no matter what happened on delivery day, but in the

03:53.980 --> 03:59.260
post-2013 gender equal world, it's now a race for the door to win the crown.
