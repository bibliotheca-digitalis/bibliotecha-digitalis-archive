00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
How to become the British monarch.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,360
Historically, the crown sat upon your head mostly because you had the biggest army.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,440
When you died, your eldest son kept control over that army and so the crown relocated

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
to his head.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
Though, of course, someone with a bigger army could change the political landscape quite

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
abruptly.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,500
As time marched on and the world grew less violent, eventually in 1701 parliament established

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,900
a set of rules to transfer the crown from one head to another, hopefully with less turmoil

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,120
than before.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,320
So here's how the 1701 rules work.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,740
First, don't be Catholic.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,080
The British monarch is also the head of the Church of England to which the monarch must

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,340
convert if not already a member.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,180
Except that if you're Catholic, no crown for you.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,260
The history of the royal family and how this rule came to be is a story for another time

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,080
but suffice it to say that bigger army diplomacy was involved.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,960
And by the way, no, you can't cleverly get around this rule by converting from Catholicism

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,480
to something else and then to Church of England.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,060
In the eyes of the crown, Catholicism is transitive.

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,020
Second, don't be a bastard.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,880
Sometimes it's good to be the king but it's never good to be the illegitimate children

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,600
of the king who are out of line for the crown from literally the moment of their conception.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,880
If you're related to the monarch but are either a Catholic or a bastard or both, the crown

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,060
has the delightful term, naturally dead, to refer to you and your lack of right to succession.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,200
Third, spouses don't count.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,780
While people often think of kings and queens as a pair, that's not the way it works here.

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
Spouses of monarchs are known as royal consorts.

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,860
They may be called prince or queen but as far as the crown is concerned, they're not

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,360
in line for the throne.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,060
They're just the matching 23 chromosomes needed for the creation of the real heir.

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,860
Fourth and finally, male primo... primogena... primogena whatever.

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,860
This is the algorithm of inheritance.

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,300
When the monarch dies or abdicates but usually dies, the crown goes to the eldest son who

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,740
isn't naturally dead.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,660
If there happens to be an elder daughter, tough luck to her.

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,460
Baby brother gets the crown.

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,020
It's simple enough but there are non-obvious cases.

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,660
Take a king with two sons.

39
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,860
If the eldest dies before the king does, obviously the crown goes to the youngest, now oldest,

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
brother.

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,980
But what if the eldest son gave the king a grandson before death?

42
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,260
Where does the crown go then?

43
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,660
Well, the crown basically pretends that everyone, except the naturally dead, is alive so upon

44
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,040
the death of the king, the crown goes to his eldest son who is now sort of the king who

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,160
just really happens to be dead.

46
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,700
So the rule kicks in again and the crown goes to his son, not, as seems obvious now, his

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
brother.

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,100
Now if this 1701 rule means that eldest sons get the crown, how did queens ever come to

49
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,100
be?

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,500
Basically, daughters were the last choice of the crown, which is why there have been

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,580
so few.

52
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,820
To get the crown, a daughter had to either be the only child of a monarch or the eldest

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,900
child without competing brothers.

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,980
So pregnant mothers must have made any daughters with queenly aspirations quite nervous.

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,680
Now sometimes the branch of a family tree dies out, be it from war or plague or whatever,

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,400
so the crown's contingency plan, if it's at a dead end, is to back up one level and

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,520
then apply the rules forward again, looking for a living head to sit upon.

58
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,820
If no luck, back up again and repeat and repeat until a living heir is found.

59
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,540
And there will always be an heir.

60
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,300
The first king of England was over a thousand years ago and the mathematics of human reproduction,

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,160
backed up by DNA evidence, reveals that just about every European alive is distantly related

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,480
to him so the crown will eventually find a way.

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
So from the first king through the new millennium, the various rules went along, making monarchs,

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,600
though with a gender biased result that nobody seemed too bothered about until suddenly in

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,240
2013 for no particular reason at all, everyone decided that the rules needed to be updated

66
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,560
right now.

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,580
So parliament and the monarchy got together and made some changes, most notably striking

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,040
the male part of rule number 4.

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,800
From 2013 on, the crown views all royal sons and daughters with equal favour.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,700
The only thing that matters is the order of their birth.

71
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,540
So prior to 2013, the boy and a set of fraternal twins in development could sit back and relax,

72
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,980
secure that the crown would be his no matter what happened on delivery day, but in the

73
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,260
post-2013 gender equal world, it's now a race for the door to win the crown.
