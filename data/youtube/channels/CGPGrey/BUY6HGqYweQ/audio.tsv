0	2240	How to become the British monarch.
2240	6360	Historically, the crown sat upon your head mostly because you had the biggest army.
6360	10440	When you died, your eldest son kept control over that army and so the crown relocated
10440	11440	to his head.
11440	15200	Though, of course, someone with a bigger army could change the political landscape quite
15200	16200	abruptly.
16200	20500	As time marched on and the world grew less violent, eventually in 1701 parliament established
20500	24900	a set of rules to transfer the crown from one head to another, hopefully with less turmoil
24900	26120	than before.
26120	28320	So here's how the 1701 rules work.
28320	29740	First, don't be Catholic.
29740	33080	The British monarch is also the head of the Church of England to which the monarch must
33080	35340	convert if not already a member.
35340	38180	Except that if you're Catholic, no crown for you.
38180	42260	The history of the royal family and how this rule came to be is a story for another time
42260	46080	but suffice it to say that bigger army diplomacy was involved.
46080	49960	And by the way, no, you can't cleverly get around this rule by converting from Catholicism
49960	52480	to something else and then to Church of England.
52480	55060	In the eyes of the crown, Catholicism is transitive.
55060	57020	Second, don't be a bastard.
57020	60880	Sometimes it's good to be the king but it's never good to be the illegitimate children
60880	65600	of the king who are out of line for the crown from literally the moment of their conception.
65600	69880	If you're related to the monarch but are either a Catholic or a bastard or both, the crown
69880	75060	has the delightful term, naturally dead, to refer to you and your lack of right to succession.
75060	77200	Third, spouses don't count.
77200	81780	While people often think of kings and queens as a pair, that's not the way it works here.
81780	84060	Spouses of monarchs are known as royal consorts.
84060	87860	They may be called prince or queen but as far as the crown is concerned, they're not
87860	89360	in line for the throne.
89360	94060	They're just the matching 23 chromosomes needed for the creation of the real heir.
94060	98860	Fourth and finally, male primo... primogena... primogena whatever.
98860	100860	This is the algorithm of inheritance.
100860	105300	When the monarch dies or abdicates but usually dies, the crown goes to the eldest son who
105300	106740	isn't naturally dead.
106740	109660	If there happens to be an elder daughter, tough luck to her.
109660	111460	Baby brother gets the crown.
111460	114020	It's simple enough but there are non-obvious cases.
114020	115660	Take a king with two sons.
115660	120860	If the eldest dies before the king does, obviously the crown goes to the youngest, now oldest,
120860	121860	brother.
121860	124980	But what if the eldest son gave the king a grandson before death?
124980	126260	Where does the crown go then?
126260	130660	Well, the crown basically pretends that everyone, except the naturally dead, is alive so upon
130660	135040	the death of the king, the crown goes to his eldest son who is now sort of the king who
135040	137160	just really happens to be dead.
137160	141700	So the rule kicks in again and the crown goes to his son, not, as seems obvious now, his
141700	142700	brother.
142700	147100	Now if this 1701 rule means that eldest sons get the crown, how did queens ever come to
147100	148100	be?
148100	151500	Basically, daughters were the last choice of the crown, which is why there have been
151500	152580	so few.
152580	156820	To get the crown, a daughter had to either be the only child of a monarch or the eldest
156820	158900	child without competing brothers.
158900	163980	So pregnant mothers must have made any daughters with queenly aspirations quite nervous.
163980	168680	Now sometimes the branch of a family tree dies out, be it from war or plague or whatever,
168680	172400	so the crown's contingency plan, if it's at a dead end, is to back up one level and
172400	176520	then apply the rules forward again, looking for a living head to sit upon.
176520	181820	If no luck, back up again and repeat and repeat until a living heir is found.
181820	183540	And there will always be an heir.
183540	188300	The first king of England was over a thousand years ago and the mathematics of human reproduction,
188300	193160	backed up by DNA evidence, reveals that just about every European alive is distantly related
193160	196480	to him so the crown will eventually find a way.
196480	200640	So from the first king through the new millennium, the various rules went along, making monarchs,
200640	204600	though with a gender biased result that nobody seemed too bothered about until suddenly in
204600	210240	2013 for no particular reason at all, everyone decided that the rules needed to be updated
210240	211560	right now.
211560	215580	So parliament and the monarchy got together and made some changes, most notably striking
215580	218040	the male part of rule number 4.
218040	222800	From 2013 on, the crown views all royal sons and daughters with equal favour.
222800	225700	The only thing that matters is the order of their birth.
225700	230540	So prior to 2013, the boy and a set of fraternal twins in development could sit back and relax,
230540	233980	secure that the crown would be his no matter what happened on delivery day, but in the
233980	239260	post-2013 gender equal world, it's now a race for the door to win the crown.
