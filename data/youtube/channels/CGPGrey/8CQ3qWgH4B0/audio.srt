00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
One year ago today, I uploaded a video to YouTube about the difference between the UK, Great Britain, and England.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,500
At the time of the upload, I'd been living in London for about eight years,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
and while I understood the basics of this foreign land,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
I still had questions niggling at the back of my mind about all the other little pieces,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,300
such as the Isle of Man and Jersey and Guernsey,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,400
who weren't exactly part of the UK, but were still somehow British.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,100
One day, while buying cream for my wife's coffee, I was confronted with this, Jersey Cows,

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,600
and could no longer contain my irritation and my own ignorance.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
What are you Jersey Cows, I wondered, and why is the Union Jack on here if you're not part of the UK?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I went home to sort this out for once and all, and what I expected would take ten minutes,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,500
but, as so often is the case when your starting point is the Wikipedia,

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,400
ended up becoming a research project involving dozens of hours.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,700
To not feel like I completely wasted my time, I turned it into the video I eventually uploaded to YouTube.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,400
I asked some locals what they thought, and soon was attacked by the monster of viral videos.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,200
Fast forward to today, and I now find myself in the odd position of being a socially reclusive guy,

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
followed by a hundred thousand plus people, whose videos have been seen more than ten million times,

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
which is more than a bit overwhelming if I think about it too much.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,500
But I want to say a huge thank you to each and every one of you,

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,900
not personally of course, as reading a hundred thousand plus names at one second each would take about 28 hours,

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,200
but a general thank you.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Thank you so much for subscribing and watching and sharing my videos.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
I also want to thank some YouTubers who've helped me along the way,

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,000
including MinutePhysics and the Vlogbrothers and Phil DeFranco, who in a single week tripled my subscribers,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
and in particular I want to thank Michael from Vsauce,

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
who was nice enough to meet up with me in the physical world at the London Googleplex,

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,700
which, getting to see the inside of made me feel 20% cooler,

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,500
where he encouraged me to make videos on a more regular schedule.

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
You, dear viewer, may know one or more of these guys,

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
but please subscribe to them all and encourage YouTube cross-pollination.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know exactly where this channel is going to go in the future,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,500
but it's been an interesting ride so far,

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
and, if you stay with me, I sincerely hope to keep making more stuff that you'll like.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Thanks again to all 100,000 of you.
