0	4800	One year ago today, I uploaded a video to YouTube about the difference between the UK, Great Britain, and England.
4800	7500	At the time of the upload, I'd been living in London for about eight years,
7500	9500	and while I understood the basics of this foreign land,
9500	13000	I still had questions niggling at the back of my mind about all the other little pieces,
13000	15300	such as the Isle of Man and Jersey and Guernsey,
15300	18400	who weren't exactly part of the UK, but were still somehow British.
18400	22100	One day, while buying cream for my wife's coffee, I was confronted with this, Jersey Cows,
22100	24600	and could no longer contain my irritation and my own ignorance.
24600	28800	What are you Jersey Cows, I wondered, and why is the Union Jack on here if you're not part of the UK?
28800	31800	I went home to sort this out for once and all, and what I expected would take ten minutes,
31800	34500	but, as so often is the case when your starting point is the Wikipedia,
34500	37400	ended up becoming a research project involving dozens of hours.
37400	41700	To not feel like I completely wasted my time, I turned it into the video I eventually uploaded to YouTube.
41700	45400	I asked some locals what they thought, and soon was attacked by the monster of viral videos.
45400	49200	Fast forward to today, and I now find myself in the odd position of being a socially reclusive guy,
49200	53200	followed by a hundred thousand plus people, whose videos have been seen more than ten million times,
53200	56200	which is more than a bit overwhelming if I think about it too much.
56200	58500	But I want to say a huge thank you to each and every one of you,
58500	62900	not personally of course, as reading a hundred thousand plus names at one second each would take about 28 hours,
62900	64200	but a general thank you.
64200	67200	Thank you so much for subscribing and watching and sharing my videos.
67200	69800	I also want to thank some YouTubers who've helped me along the way,
69800	74000	including MinutePhysics and the Vlogbrothers and Phil DeFranco, who in a single week tripled my subscribers,
74000	76200	and in particular I want to thank Michael from Vsauce,
76200	79000	who was nice enough to meet up with me in the physical world at the London Googleplex,
79000	81700	which, getting to see the inside of made me feel 20% cooler,
81700	84500	where he encouraged me to make videos on a more regular schedule.
84500	86500	You, dear viewer, may know one or more of these guys,
86500	89500	but please subscribe to them all and encourage YouTube cross-pollination.
89500	92000	I don't know exactly where this channel is going to go in the future,
92000	93500	but it's been an interesting ride so far,
93500	97500	and, if you stay with me, I sincerely hope to keep making more stuff that you'll like.
97500	100000	Thanks again to all 100,000 of you.
