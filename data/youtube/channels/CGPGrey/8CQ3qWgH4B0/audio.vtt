One year ago today, I uploaded a video to YouTube about the difference between the UK, Great Britain, and England.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.500
At the time of the upload, I'd been living in London for about eight years,

00:07.500 --> 00:09.500
and while I understood the basics of this foreign land,

00:09.500 --> 00:13.000
I still had questions niggling at the back of my mind about all the other little pieces,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.300
such as the Isle of Man and Jersey and Guernsey,

00:15.300 --> 00:18.400
who weren't exactly part of the UK, but were still somehow British.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.100
One day, while buying cream for my wife's coffee, I was confronted with this, Jersey Cows,

00:22.100 --> 00:24.600
and could no longer contain my irritation and my own ignorance.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.800
What are you Jersey Cows, I wondered, and why is the Union Jack on here if you're not part of the UK?

00:28.800 --> 00:31.800
I went home to sort this out for once and all, and what I expected would take ten minutes,

00:31.800 --> 00:34.500
but, as so often is the case when your starting point is the Wikipedia,

00:34.500 --> 00:37.400
ended up becoming a research project involving dozens of hours.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.700
To not feel like I completely wasted my time, I turned it into the video I eventually uploaded to YouTube.

00:41.700 --> 00:45.400
I asked some locals what they thought, and soon was attacked by the monster of viral videos.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.200
Fast forward to today, and I now find myself in the odd position of being a socially reclusive guy,

00:49.200 --> 00:53.200
followed by a hundred thousand plus people, whose videos have been seen more than ten million times,

00:53.200 --> 00:56.200
which is more than a bit overwhelming if I think about it too much.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.500
But I want to say a huge thank you to each and every one of you,

00:58.500 --> 01:02.900
not personally of course, as reading a hundred thousand plus names at one second each would take about 28 hours,

01:02.900 --> 01:04.200
but a general thank you.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.200
Thank you so much for subscribing and watching and sharing my videos.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.800
I also want to thank some YouTubers who've helped me along the way,

01:09.800 --> 01:14.000
including MinutePhysics and the Vlogbrothers and Phil DeFranco, who in a single week tripled my subscribers,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.200
and in particular I want to thank Michael from Vsauce,

01:16.200 --> 01:19.000
who was nice enough to meet up with me in the physical world at the London Googleplex,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.700
which, getting to see the inside of made me feel 20% cooler,

01:21.700 --> 01:24.500
where he encouraged me to make videos on a more regular schedule.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.500
You, dear viewer, may know one or more of these guys,

01:26.500 --> 01:29.500
but please subscribe to them all and encourage YouTube cross-pollination.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.000
I don't know exactly where this channel is going to go in the future,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
but it's been an interesting ride so far,

01:33.500 --> 01:37.500
and, if you stay with me, I sincerely hope to keep making more stuff that you'll like.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.000
Thanks again to all 100,000 of you.
