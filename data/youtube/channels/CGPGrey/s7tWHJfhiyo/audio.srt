00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Welcome to The Problem with First Past the Post voting explained by me, CGP Grey.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,720
The royal family has a problem, but this isn't just any royal family, these are the lions,

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,800
rulers of the jungle since time immemorial.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,280
There are protests over the monarchy's absolute power and the citizens of the animal kingdom

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,120
want a say in how they are governed.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,840
Bending to the pressure, lion has abdicated his crown and king is to be an elected office.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,240
To ensure a smooth transition, and because she is craftier than her husband, the queen

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,640
lioness is remaining on the throne with the power to set the rules for all elections in

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,040
her kingdom.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,000
She has declared that all citizens get one and only one vote and that the candidate with

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,240
the most votes wins the crown.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,760
This method of voting is most often called First Past the Post, awkwardly abbreviated

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
as FPTP or winner take all.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,120
The system is simple, fair and logical, right?

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Actually no.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
It's a terrible, terrible idea.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Why?

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,980
Well to see the problems with First Past the Post, let's watch the first election unfold

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,980
in the animal kingdom.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,060
It's an exciting time for the burgeoning democracy and seven hopeful candidates come forward

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,160
to run and represent their parties.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
They put on their best campaigns, citizens head out to the polls and the votes are counted.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,420
The results come in as follows.

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,700
Turtle gets 9% of the vote, Monkey gets 18%, Gorilla gets 19%, Owl gets 13%, Leopard gets

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,820
20%, Tiger gets 15% and Snake gets 6%.

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,680
Under the rules of First Past the Post, Leopard is crowned the winner and she gets to rule

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,460
for the length of her term.

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,020
But take another look at the results and you'll see the first problem with this system, minority

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
rule.

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,460
The vast majority of citizens, 80%, wanted someone else's king but Leopard still won.

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,040
There were only seven candidates in this race but if you imagine if there had been 20, she

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,580
might have only gotten 5% of the vote but still been elected.

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,060
This problem of minority rule is only the beginning.

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,640
The second problem with First Past the Post is that, given enough time, it results in

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,300
an inevitable, unavoidable two-party system.

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
Why?

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
To see, let's watch what happens over several election cycles.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,320
Leopard has had her term in office and it's again election time in the young democracy.

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,000
Only now, all the citizens of Animal Kingdom remember the results from last time.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,760
This information changes how they'll behave, particularly Snake and Turtle voters who must

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,120
face the reality that they've backed unappealing, extremist candidates who don't have a chance

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
of winning.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,440
Turtle voters, who were unhappy under Leopard rule, decide to back the candidate who has

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,240
the best chance of winning, Gorilla.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,320
Now Snake voters want to vote for Tiger, who is the candidate they have the most in common

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,880
with, but they're afraid to because Leopard is running a negative campaign against her

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,160
competitors.

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,740
Snake voters, not liking the idea of Gorilla rule, vote strategically for Leopard.

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,460
The final result looks like this, with Leopard getting 26% of the vote and Gorilla getting

50
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,540
28%, making him the new king.

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,060
Snake and Turtle, seeing their dismal results and knowing the cost of their campaigns, decide

52
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,020
to drop out of future races.

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,980
What started out as a seven-party system is now down to five.

54
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,880
Fast forward to the next election.

55
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,540
Only five candidates run, and again the voters remember what happened last time.

56
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,120
In this election, it's Owl voters who recognize that their candidate cannot win.

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,500
They are centrist voters and less ideological than the rest of the Animal Kingdom.

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,860
As such, they don't really like Gorilla or Leopard.

59
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,980
Both Gorilla and Leopard know this, so they each run negative campaigns to capitalize

60
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,660
on the fears of the centrists.

61
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,140
Owl voters split their vote and are mostly voting against the candidate they dislike

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,700
rather than supporting the candidate they do like.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,700
After this election, Gorilla gets 33% of the vote and Leopard gets 34%, making her the

64
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
winner.

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,820
Owl, as did Turtle and Snake before her, drops out of the race.

66
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,740
In the last election we'll look at, Monkey and Tiger voters are unhappy.

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,420
They both really like the candidates they have supported, but they now have to compromise.

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,300
Monkey voters agree with Gorilla on few issues, but they really don't like Leopard.

69
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,540
And Tiger voters agree with Leopard on some issues, but they really don't like Gorilla.

70
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,760
They strategically abandon their preferred candidate out of fear of the one they disagree

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,400
with the most becoming king.

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,180
The final results are Leopard 49% and Gorilla 51, with him being crowned the king.

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,580
Monkey and Tiger are the last candidates to drop out, and now the Animal Kingdom is left

74
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,780
with the two-party system.

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,540
Because of the centrist and swayable Owl voters, in future elections, Leopard might take the

76
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,400
crown, then Gorilla wins it back, only to lose it to Leopard again, but the two parties

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,860
never change.

78
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,220
The citizens of Animal Kingdom ended up with the system, not because they are lazy voters

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,300
or because that's what they really wanted, but because of the mathematics of how the

80
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,660
system is set up.

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,880
Inevitably, given enough time, all first-past-the-post systems trend towards two main parties.

82
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
But the choices of the voters still hasn't changed since that first election.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,260
Only two-fifths of them wanted either Leopard or Gorilla as their first choice, and three-fifths

84
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,340
of them wanted someone else as their first choice.

85
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,300
It's this majority of the voters that becomes disinterested in the democratic process because

86
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,900
they feel they have no meaningful way to express their real preferences.

87
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,740
But it only gets worse from here.

88
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,780
If the citizens of Animal Kingdom are divided into groups before they vote, they are susceptible

89
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,820
to gerrymandering.

90
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,580
Gerrymandering is a bit tricky, but imagine a block of ten homes each with one voter inside.

91
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,500
Three are Leopard voters, three are Gorilla voters, and four are Owl voters.

92
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,640
If they're divided up into groups before they vote, whoever decides where the lines are

93
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,060
drawn has enormous influence over who wins the election.

94
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,500
For example, if you group the three Leopard voters with the two Owl voters, and do the

95
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,460
same with the three Gorilla voters, you can eliminate Owl from the election, even though

96
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,480
Owl voters have the largest minority and would win under a straight first-past-the-post vote.

97
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,460
If the Leopard or Gorilla parties are in charge when the voting boundaries are drawn, they

98
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,680
have enormous incentive to carve out safe seats for themselves.

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,700
But more on gerrymandering in another video.

100
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,620
Bah, I hear you say, vote third party and change the system.

101
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,380
This brings us to the final, and possibly worst, problem of first-past-the-post, the

102
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,860
spoiler effect.

103
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,520
Imagine now that it's been years and years of Gorilla or Leopard rule.

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,580
Tiger decides it's time to enter the race.

105
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,500
He thinks that the voters are tired of the status quo and he has a shot at winning.

106
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,580
He sets up his campaign office, gets a surprising amount of gold and donations, and gets on

107
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,660
the Animal News Network to debate with the main candidates.

108
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,020
Election night comes around, but alas, Tiger gets only 15% of the vote, mostly from Leopard

109
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,540
voters, who are closest to him on the political spectrum.

110
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,220
Gorilla easily beats Leopard and gets to be king.

111
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,580
This is the first-past-the-post system at its worst.

112
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,280
The better a third-party candidate does, the more it hurts its own voters by guaranteeing

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,060
a loss for the party they most agree with and a win for the party they most disagree

114
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
with.

115
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,940
And don't forget, Gorilla is no fool.

116
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,420
He knows how the system works.

117
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,220
Where do you think some of those gold donations came from?

118
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,340
Meanwhile, the Queen Lioness is displeased.

119
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,500
She's been observing the elections and sees that the system is bad for her subjects.

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,300
And she's been thinking, what makes a good voting system?

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,060
Well, you should be able to vote for the candidate who you like the most, without worrying.

122
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
Your choice in representatives is better.

123
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,340
The system shouldn't be susceptible to gerrymandering, and it should be open to new political parties.

124
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,600
Luckily for the Queen, there are several different voting systems to choose from, including the

125
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,500
alternative vote, but that will have to be discussed in detail at another time.

126
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,380
Thank you very much for watching.
