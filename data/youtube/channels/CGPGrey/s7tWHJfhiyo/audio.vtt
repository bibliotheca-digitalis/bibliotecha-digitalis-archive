00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
Welcome to The Problem with First Past the Post voting explained by me, CGP Grey.

00:07.480 --> 00:11.720
The royal family has a problem, but this isn't just any royal family, these are the lions,

00:11.720 --> 00:13.800
rulers of the jungle since time immemorial.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.280
There are protests over the monarchy's absolute power and the citizens of the animal kingdom

00:17.280 --> 00:19.120
want a say in how they are governed.

00:19.120 --> 00:23.840
Bending to the pressure, lion has abdicated his crown and king is to be an elected office.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.240
To ensure a smooth transition, and because she is craftier than her husband, the queen

00:27.240 --> 00:30.640
lioness is remaining on the throne with the power to set the rules for all elections in

00:30.640 --> 00:32.040
her kingdom.

00:32.040 --> 00:36.000
She has declared that all citizens get one and only one vote and that the candidate with

00:36.000 --> 00:38.240
the most votes wins the crown.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.760
This method of voting is most often called First Past the Post, awkwardly abbreviated

00:41.760 --> 00:44.160
as FPTP or winner take all.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.120
The system is simple, fair and logical, right?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.120
Actually no.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
It's a terrible, terrible idea.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
Why?

00:50.120 --> 00:52.980
Well to see the problems with First Past the Post, let's watch the first election unfold

00:52.980 --> 00:53.980
in the animal kingdom.

00:54.580 --> 00:58.060
It's an exciting time for the burgeoning democracy and seven hopeful candidates come forward

00:58.060 --> 01:00.160
to run and represent their parties.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.680
They put on their best campaigns, citizens head out to the polls and the votes are counted.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.420
The results come in as follows.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.700
Turtle gets 9% of the vote, Monkey gets 18%, Gorilla gets 19%, Owl gets 13%, Leopard gets

01:10.700 --> 01:13.820
20%, Tiger gets 15% and Snake gets 6%.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.680
Under the rules of First Past the Post, Leopard is crowned the winner and she gets to rule

01:16.680 --> 01:18.460
for the length of her term.

01:18.460 --> 01:22.020
But take another look at the results and you'll see the first problem with this system, minority

01:22.020 --> 01:23.020
rule.

01:23.060 --> 01:27.460
The vast majority of citizens, 80%, wanted someone else's king but Leopard still won.

01:27.460 --> 01:31.040
There were only seven candidates in this race but if you imagine if there had been 20, she

01:31.040 --> 01:34.580
might have only gotten 5% of the vote but still been elected.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.060
This problem of minority rule is only the beginning.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.640
The second problem with First Past the Post is that, given enough time, it results in

01:40.640 --> 01:43.300
an inevitable, unavoidable two-party system.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.300
Why?

01:44.300 --> 01:47.300
To see, let's watch what happens over several election cycles.

01:47.300 --> 01:51.320
Leopard has had her term in office and it's again election time in the young democracy.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.000
Only now, all the citizens of Animal Kingdom remember the results from last time.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.760
This information changes how they'll behave, particularly Snake and Turtle voters who must

01:58.760 --> 02:02.120
face the reality that they've backed unappealing, extremist candidates who don't have a chance

02:02.120 --> 02:03.120
of winning.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.440
Turtle voters, who were unhappy under Leopard rule, decide to back the candidate who has

02:06.440 --> 02:08.240
the best chance of winning, Gorilla.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.320
Now Snake voters want to vote for Tiger, who is the candidate they have the most in common

02:12.320 --> 02:15.880
with, but they're afraid to because Leopard is running a negative campaign against her

02:15.880 --> 02:17.160
competitors.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.740
Snake voters, not liking the idea of Gorilla rule, vote strategically for Leopard.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.460
The final result looks like this, with Leopard getting 26% of the vote and Gorilla getting

02:24.460 --> 02:26.540
28%, making him the new king.

02:26.540 --> 02:30.060
Snake and Turtle, seeing their dismal results and knowing the cost of their campaigns, decide

02:30.060 --> 02:32.020
to drop out of future races.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.980
What started out as a seven-party system is now down to five.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.880
Fast forward to the next election.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.540
Only five candidates run, and again the voters remember what happened last time.

02:40.540 --> 02:44.120
In this election, it's Owl voters who recognize that their candidate cannot win.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.500
They are centrist voters and less ideological than the rest of the Animal Kingdom.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.860
As such, they don't really like Gorilla or Leopard.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.980
Both Gorilla and Leopard know this, so they each run negative campaigns to capitalize

02:52.980 --> 02:54.660
on the fears of the centrists.

02:54.660 --> 02:58.140
Owl voters split their vote and are mostly voting against the candidate they dislike

02:58.140 --> 03:00.700
rather than supporting the candidate they do like.

03:00.700 --> 03:04.700
After this election, Gorilla gets 33% of the vote and Leopard gets 34%, making her the

03:04.700 --> 03:05.700
winner.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.820
Owl, as did Turtle and Snake before her, drops out of the race.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.740
In the last election we'll look at, Monkey and Tiger voters are unhappy.

03:12.740 --> 03:16.420
They both really like the candidates they have supported, but they now have to compromise.

03:16.420 --> 03:20.300
Monkey voters agree with Gorilla on few issues, but they really don't like Leopard.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.540
And Tiger voters agree with Leopard on some issues, but they really don't like Gorilla.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.760
They strategically abandon their preferred candidate out of fear of the one they disagree

03:27.760 --> 03:29.400
with the most becoming king.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.180
The final results are Leopard 49% and Gorilla 51, with him being crowned the king.

03:34.180 --> 03:37.580
Monkey and Tiger are the last candidates to drop out, and now the Animal Kingdom is left

03:37.580 --> 03:39.780
with the two-party system.

03:39.780 --> 03:43.540
Because of the centrist and swayable Owl voters, in future elections, Leopard might take the

03:43.540 --> 03:47.400
crown, then Gorilla wins it back, only to lose it to Leopard again, but the two parties

03:47.400 --> 03:48.860
never change.

03:48.860 --> 03:52.220
The citizens of Animal Kingdom ended up with the system, not because they are lazy voters

03:52.220 --> 03:55.300
or because that's what they really wanted, but because of the mathematics of how the

03:55.300 --> 03:56.660
system is set up.

03:56.660 --> 04:01.880
Inevitably, given enough time, all first-past-the-post systems trend towards two main parties.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.880
But the choices of the voters still hasn't changed since that first election.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.260
Only two-fifths of them wanted either Leopard or Gorilla as their first choice, and three-fifths

04:08.260 --> 04:10.340
of them wanted someone else as their first choice.

04:11.020 --> 04:14.300
It's this majority of the voters that becomes disinterested in the democratic process because

04:14.300 --> 04:16.900
they feel they have no meaningful way to express their real preferences.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.740
But it only gets worse from here.

04:18.740 --> 04:22.780
If the citizens of Animal Kingdom are divided into groups before they vote, they are susceptible

04:22.780 --> 04:24.820
to gerrymandering.

04:24.820 --> 04:28.580
Gerrymandering is a bit tricky, but imagine a block of ten homes each with one voter inside.

04:28.580 --> 04:32.500
Three are Leopard voters, three are Gorilla voters, and four are Owl voters.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.640
If they're divided up into groups before they vote, whoever decides where the lines are

04:35.640 --> 04:39.060
drawn has enormous influence over who wins the election.

04:39.060 --> 04:42.500
For example, if you group the three Leopard voters with the two Owl voters, and do the

04:42.500 --> 04:46.460
same with the three Gorilla voters, you can eliminate Owl from the election, even though

04:46.460 --> 04:51.480
Owl voters have the largest minority and would win under a straight first-past-the-post vote.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.460
If the Leopard or Gorilla parties are in charge when the voting boundaries are drawn, they

04:54.460 --> 04:57.680
have enormous incentive to carve out safe seats for themselves.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.700
But more on gerrymandering in another video.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.620
Bah, I hear you say, vote third party and change the system.

05:03.620 --> 05:07.380
This brings us to the final, and possibly worst, problem of first-past-the-post, the

05:07.380 --> 05:08.860
spoiler effect.

05:08.860 --> 05:12.520
Imagine now that it's been years and years of Gorilla or Leopard rule.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.580
Tiger decides it's time to enter the race.

05:14.580 --> 05:18.500
He thinks that the voters are tired of the status quo and he has a shot at winning.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.580
He sets up his campaign office, gets a surprising amount of gold and donations, and gets on

05:22.580 --> 05:25.660
the Animal News Network to debate with the main candidates.

05:25.660 --> 05:30.020
Election night comes around, but alas, Tiger gets only 15% of the vote, mostly from Leopard

05:30.020 --> 05:32.540
voters, who are closest to him on the political spectrum.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.220
Gorilla easily beats Leopard and gets to be king.

05:35.220 --> 05:37.580
This is the first-past-the-post system at its worst.

05:37.580 --> 05:41.280
The better a third-party candidate does, the more it hurts its own voters by guaranteeing

05:41.280 --> 05:45.060
a loss for the party they most agree with and a win for the party they most disagree

05:45.060 --> 05:46.060
with.

05:46.060 --> 05:47.940
And don't forget, Gorilla is no fool.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.420
He knows how the system works.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.220
Where do you think some of those gold donations came from?

05:52.220 --> 05:55.340
Meanwhile, the Queen Lioness is displeased.

05:55.340 --> 05:58.500
She's been observing the elections and sees that the system is bad for her subjects.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.300
And she's been thinking, what makes a good voting system?

06:01.300 --> 06:06.060
Well, you should be able to vote for the candidate who you like the most, without worrying.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.220
Your choice in representatives is better.

06:08.220 --> 06:13.340
The system shouldn't be susceptible to gerrymandering, and it should be open to new political parties.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.600
Luckily for the Queen, there are several different voting systems to choose from, including the

06:16.600 --> 06:20.500
alternative vote, but that will have to be discussed in detail at another time.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.380
Thank you very much for watching.
