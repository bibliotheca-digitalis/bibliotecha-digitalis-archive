0	7480	Welcome to The Problem with First Past the Post voting explained by me, CGP Grey.
7480	11720	The royal family has a problem, but this isn't just any royal family, these are the lions,
11720	13800	rulers of the jungle since time immemorial.
13800	17280	There are protests over the monarchy's absolute power and the citizens of the animal kingdom
17280	19120	want a say in how they are governed.
19120	23840	Bending to the pressure, lion has abdicated his crown and king is to be an elected office.
23840	27240	To ensure a smooth transition, and because she is craftier than her husband, the queen
27240	30640	lioness is remaining on the throne with the power to set the rules for all elections in
30640	32040	her kingdom.
32040	36000	She has declared that all citizens get one and only one vote and that the candidate with
36000	38240	the most votes wins the crown.
38240	41760	This method of voting is most often called First Past the Post, awkwardly abbreviated
41760	44160	as FPTP or winner take all.
44160	47120	The system is simple, fair and logical, right?
47120	48120	Actually no.
48120	49120	It's a terrible, terrible idea.
49120	50120	Why?
50120	52980	Well to see the problems with First Past the Post, let's watch the first election unfold
52980	53980	in the animal kingdom.
54580	58060	It's an exciting time for the burgeoning democracy and seven hopeful candidates come forward
58060	60160	to run and represent their parties.
60160	63680	They put on their best campaigns, citizens head out to the polls and the votes are counted.
63680	65420	The results come in as follows.
65420	70700	Turtle gets 9% of the vote, Monkey gets 18%, Gorilla gets 19%, Owl gets 13%, Leopard gets
70700	73820	20%, Tiger gets 15% and Snake gets 6%.
73820	76680	Under the rules of First Past the Post, Leopard is crowned the winner and she gets to rule
76680	78460	for the length of her term.
78460	82020	But take another look at the results and you'll see the first problem with this system, minority
82020	83020	rule.
83060	87460	The vast majority of citizens, 80%, wanted someone else's king but Leopard still won.
87460	91040	There were only seven candidates in this race but if you imagine if there had been 20, she
91040	94580	might have only gotten 5% of the vote but still been elected.
94580	97060	This problem of minority rule is only the beginning.
97060	100640	The second problem with First Past the Post is that, given enough time, it results in
100640	103300	an inevitable, unavoidable two-party system.
103300	104300	Why?
104300	107300	To see, let's watch what happens over several election cycles.
107300	111320	Leopard has had her term in office and it's again election time in the young democracy.
111320	115000	Only now, all the citizens of Animal Kingdom remember the results from last time.
115000	118760	This information changes how they'll behave, particularly Snake and Turtle voters who must
118760	122120	face the reality that they've backed unappealing, extremist candidates who don't have a chance
122120	123120	of winning.
123120	126440	Turtle voters, who were unhappy under Leopard rule, decide to back the candidate who has
126440	128240	the best chance of winning, Gorilla.
128240	132320	Now Snake voters want to vote for Tiger, who is the candidate they have the most in common
132320	135880	with, but they're afraid to because Leopard is running a negative campaign against her
135880	137160	competitors.
137160	140740	Snake voters, not liking the idea of Gorilla rule, vote strategically for Leopard.
140740	144460	The final result looks like this, with Leopard getting 26% of the vote and Gorilla getting
144460	146540	28%, making him the new king.
146540	150060	Snake and Turtle, seeing their dismal results and knowing the cost of their campaigns, decide
150060	152020	to drop out of future races.
152020	154980	What started out as a seven-party system is now down to five.
154980	156880	Fast forward to the next election.
156880	160540	Only five candidates run, and again the voters remember what happened last time.
160540	164120	In this election, it's Owl voters who recognize that their candidate cannot win.
164120	167500	They are centrist voters and less ideological than the rest of the Animal Kingdom.
167500	169860	As such, they don't really like Gorilla or Leopard.
169860	172980	Both Gorilla and Leopard know this, so they each run negative campaigns to capitalize
172980	174660	on the fears of the centrists.
174660	178140	Owl voters split their vote and are mostly voting against the candidate they dislike
178140	180700	rather than supporting the candidate they do like.
180700	184700	After this election, Gorilla gets 33% of the vote and Leopard gets 34%, making her the
184700	185700	winner.
185700	188820	Owl, as did Turtle and Snake before her, drops out of the race.
188820	192740	In the last election we'll look at, Monkey and Tiger voters are unhappy.
192740	196420	They both really like the candidates they have supported, but they now have to compromise.
196420	200300	Monkey voters agree with Gorilla on few issues, but they really don't like Leopard.
200300	204540	And Tiger voters agree with Leopard on some issues, but they really don't like Gorilla.
204540	207760	They strategically abandon their preferred candidate out of fear of the one they disagree
207760	209400	with the most becoming king.
209400	214180	The final results are Leopard 49% and Gorilla 51, with him being crowned the king.
214180	217580	Monkey and Tiger are the last candidates to drop out, and now the Animal Kingdom is left
217580	219780	with the two-party system.
219780	223540	Because of the centrist and swayable Owl voters, in future elections, Leopard might take the
223540	227400	crown, then Gorilla wins it back, only to lose it to Leopard again, but the two parties
227400	228860	never change.
228860	232220	The citizens of Animal Kingdom ended up with the system, not because they are lazy voters
232220	235300	or because that's what they really wanted, but because of the mathematics of how the
235300	236660	system is set up.
236660	241880	Inevitably, given enough time, all first-past-the-post systems trend towards two main parties.
241880	244880	But the choices of the voters still hasn't changed since that first election.
244880	248260	Only two-fifths of them wanted either Leopard or Gorilla as their first choice, and three-fifths
248260	250340	of them wanted someone else as their first choice.
251020	254300	It's this majority of the voters that becomes disinterested in the democratic process because
254300	256900	they feel they have no meaningful way to express their real preferences.
256900	258740	But it only gets worse from here.
258740	262780	If the citizens of Animal Kingdom are divided into groups before they vote, they are susceptible
262780	264820	to gerrymandering.
264820	268580	Gerrymandering is a bit tricky, but imagine a block of ten homes each with one voter inside.
268580	272500	Three are Leopard voters, three are Gorilla voters, and four are Owl voters.
272500	275640	If they're divided up into groups before they vote, whoever decides where the lines are
275640	279060	drawn has enormous influence over who wins the election.
279060	282500	For example, if you group the three Leopard voters with the two Owl voters, and do the
282500	286460	same with the three Gorilla voters, you can eliminate Owl from the election, even though
286460	291480	Owl voters have the largest minority and would win under a straight first-past-the-post vote.
291480	294460	If the Leopard or Gorilla parties are in charge when the voting boundaries are drawn, they
294460	297680	have enormous incentive to carve out safe seats for themselves.
297680	299700	But more on gerrymandering in another video.
299700	303620	Bah, I hear you say, vote third party and change the system.
303620	307380	This brings us to the final, and possibly worst, problem of first-past-the-post, the
307380	308860	spoiler effect.
308860	312520	Imagine now that it's been years and years of Gorilla or Leopard rule.
312520	314580	Tiger decides it's time to enter the race.
314580	318500	He thinks that the voters are tired of the status quo and he has a shot at winning.
318500	322580	He sets up his campaign office, gets a surprising amount of gold and donations, and gets on
322580	325660	the Animal News Network to debate with the main candidates.
325660	330020	Election night comes around, but alas, Tiger gets only 15% of the vote, mostly from Leopard
330020	332540	voters, who are closest to him on the political spectrum.
332540	335220	Gorilla easily beats Leopard and gets to be king.
335220	337580	This is the first-past-the-post system at its worst.
337580	341280	The better a third-party candidate does, the more it hurts its own voters by guaranteeing
341280	345060	a loss for the party they most agree with and a win for the party they most disagree
345060	346060	with.
346060	347940	And don't forget, Gorilla is no fool.
347940	349420	He knows how the system works.
349420	352220	Where do you think some of those gold donations came from?
352220	355340	Meanwhile, the Queen Lioness is displeased.
355340	358500	She's been observing the elections and sees that the system is bad for her subjects.
358500	361300	And she's been thinking, what makes a good voting system?
361300	366060	Well, you should be able to vote for the candidate who you like the most, without worrying.
366060	368220	Your choice in representatives is better.
368220	373340	The system shouldn't be susceptible to gerrymandering, and it should be open to new political parties.
373340	376600	Luckily for the Queen, there are several different voting systems to choose from, including the
376600	380500	alternative vote, but that will have to be discussed in detail at another time.
380500	381380	Thank you very much for watching.
