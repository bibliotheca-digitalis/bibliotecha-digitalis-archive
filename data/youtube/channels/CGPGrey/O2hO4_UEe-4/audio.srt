1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Please, put on your headphones.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,520
I promise there won't be any loud sounds, but this video is going to hurt.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,460
There's a study about hypersounds and how they cause headaches.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,160
These sounds are too high-pitched to hear, like the one added to this video playing right

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,700
now, but cause headaches they still do.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,940
The hypersound in your headphones is pressing on your inner ear, stressing the nerves leading

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,880
to your brain where, if the headache hasn't started already, it soon will as exposure

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,480
causes headaches after only 10 seconds.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,620
Oh my.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Can you feel it?

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,700
That pressure in your ears spreading to your now-throbbing brain?

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,920
Because you shouldn't.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,100
This study is made up, and there's no hypersound in the audio, but some of you will still have

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,740
begun to feel a headache.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
Why?

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,740
The nocebo effect.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,580
A nocebo is a harmless thing, like a video with non-existent hypersounds, that causes

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,840
harm like a headache because you believe it's harmful.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,480
That sounds like voodoo, but there's real science behind the nocebo effect, which is

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,540
more than an irritating parlor trick.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,380
It causes real problems, like in medicine.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,740
When testing a new drug, doctors get a group of sick people, give half of them the new

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,780
drug and give the other half a fake pill that does nothing but which they're told is real.

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,580
This is how science finds the stuff that works amongst the junk that doesn't.

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,500
But new drugs have side effects, and sometimes patients drop out of the experiment because

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
of them.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,620
No surprise there.

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,620
But some people on the fake also drop out from the side effects.

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,300
Side effects they've gotten from a drug they aren't taking, but because they think they're

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,260
on the real thing, they've also thought themselves into the side effects.

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,540
Now maybe this is just a case of misattribution.

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,740
People get headaches, and if they've joined a drug trial that lists headaches in the side

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,320
effects, it's natural to blame the new drug, and that certainly happens to some extent.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,100
But the nocebo effect is more than just misattribution.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,060
It causes real additional harm that scientists can measure in cruel, cruel experiments.

36
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,020
And this is one of the reasons there's not an overabundance of research on nocebos.

37
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,500
Approach your friendly neighborhood ethics board with an experiment designed to hurt

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,540
people and they'll frown on that.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,600
But sometimes nocebo experiments do get approved to the benefit of science and humanity, if

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,900
not the participants.

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,340
For example, under the right conditions, some people who expect a harmless injection will

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,520
give them a rash will get a rash, but for people who expect nothing to happen, nothing

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,400
is exactly what happens.

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,100
And fake pills can be addictive.

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,460
Take test subjects off pills they believe are addictive and some will experience nocebic

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,960
withdrawal symptoms like pain and fatigue from pills they could never have been addicted

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,460
to in the first place.

48
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,180
Another experiment gave people harmless injections, told half of them to sit there, and told the

49
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,320
other half their pain would increase for the next 30 minutes, which it did.

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,140
But in this situation, there's a drug that can block the nocebo effect, and those who

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,060
were told the injection would hurt, but were also secretly given a nocebo-blocking drug

52
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,900
did not report an increase in pain, showing that the nocebo effect is a real, physical

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
process.

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,060
In all these nocebo experiments, it's the belief in harm that matters.

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,660
If someone dressed as a voodoo witch doctor popped up and hexed you with a curse of great

56
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,140
pain, no effect.

57
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,480
But in a room with a real doctor and his clipboard and a big science machine and a needle in

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,500
your arm, you'll take his words rather more seriously.

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,460
Which is why doctors say, this won't hurt a bit, rather than, oh this?

60
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,540
It's going to hurt.

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,540
Like a lot.

62
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,340
Which, by the way, was a real experiment done on women undergoing labor during spinal injections.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,600
Guess how that turned out.

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,260
But nocebos don't end here.

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,500
While illnesses like the flu spread from contact with disgusting germ-infected humans and the

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,140
things they touch with their disgusting, germy hands, a nocebo spreads from mind to

67
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,180
mind, no contact required.

68
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,820
A notable example happened in a Tennessee high school.

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,740
One teacher reported a strange smell in her classroom and developed symptoms of headache,

70
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,620
nausea, and difficulty breathing.

71
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,900
These symptoms spread to some of her students and from them to others in the school.

72
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,180
Almost 200 people ended up at the local hospital, but all medical tests came back with nothing,

73
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,040
nor was anything harmful found at the school.

74
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,760
This was a nocebo, the belief that the air was making them sick spread from mind to mind.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,360
Everyone who got sick heard about the symptoms from someone else.

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,600
When this happens, it's called mass psychogenic illness.

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,780
The treatment in these cases is to separate those with symptoms from the rest and reassure

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,980
the ill that yes, their symptoms are real, but no, they haven't been exposed to anything

79
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,300
toxic and yes, people are getting better quickly.

80
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,700
This last is one of the indicators that separates a real poison gas leak or biological weapon

81
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,460
from mass psychogenic illness.

82
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,620
But the final factor, number of cases increasing with greater media coverage, can lead to this

83
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,260
kind of thing spreading far and wide.

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,620
Take electro-sensitives, people who get nausea, among other things, from exposure to parts

85
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,180
of the electromagnetic spectrum, notably Wi-Fi, the density of which is increasing over time,

86
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,760
forcing particularly bad sufferers to retreat to places like the creepy sounding radio silent

87
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,380
zone in, where else, West Virginia.

88
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,420
You put electro-sensitives in a room with a Wi-Fi router and they can't actually tell

89
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,100
via their symptoms if it's on or off.

90
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,200
Instead, their symptoms track with being told if it's on or off.

91
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,720
And if you make a group of people without electro-sensitivity watch a news report on

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,140
how Wi-Fi makes you ill while another group watches something uninformative and afterward

93
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,220
expose both groups to a fake Wi-Fi signal, only those who watch the news report feel

94
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,220
sick.

95
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,180
There's a similar phenomenon called wind farm disease with similar side effects which

96
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,380
turns up where it's been talked about on the local news but not in other places in

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,540
the same country with the same wind farms where it isn't.

98
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,300
All this makes it too easy to mock people for thinking they're getting sick from Wi-Fi

99
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,400
or wind farms or wind farms with Wi-Fi but it's important to realize they're not crazy.

100
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,820
The side effects are real, they're just wrong about the source.

101
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,380
All evidence points to the belief in electro-sensitivity as the cause of electro-sensitivity.

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,060
Which means the news reports talking about these illnesses are spreading a kind of mind

103
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,580
virus and while these are exotic examples there's also evidence that some allergies

104
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,060
and asthma cases are nocebic and thus able to be spread in the same way.

105
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,860
To be clear, if someone's having an asthma attack that's not the time to tell them you

106
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,940
know they're being a drama llama because you watched an internet video about the nocebo

107
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,940
effect.

108
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,820
They're really having an asthma attack and they really need something to make it stop

109
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,280
and that's really not you showing off your knowledge.

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,300
Harmful things aren't just harmful because we believe they are.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,260
The right dose of arsenic will kill you just as surely as an anvil to the head no matter

112
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,860
your insistence otherwise but the nocebo effect does show that our beliefs about otherwise

113
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,220
harmless things can make them harmful.

114
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,280
Which means that our voodoo doctor's hex from before really could work but only if you were

115
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,780
foolish enough to believe him.

116
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,380
you
