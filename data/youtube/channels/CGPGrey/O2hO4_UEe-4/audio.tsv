0	1960	Please, put on your headphones.
1960	6520	I promise there won't be any loud sounds, but this video is going to hurt.
6520	9460	There's a study about hypersounds and how they cause headaches.
9460	14160	These sounds are too high-pitched to hear, like the one added to this video playing right
14160	16700	now, but cause headaches they still do.
16700	20940	The hypersound in your headphones is pressing on your inner ear, stressing the nerves leading
20940	25880	to your brain where, if the headache hasn't started already, it soon will as exposure
25880	28480	causes headaches after only 10 seconds.
28480	29620	Oh my.
29620	30620	Can you feel it?
30620	33700	That pressure in your ears spreading to your now-throbbing brain?
33700	34920	Because you shouldn't.
34920	39100	This study is made up, and there's no hypersound in the audio, but some of you will still have
39100	40740	begun to feel a headache.
40740	41740	Why?
41740	42740	The nocebo effect.
42740	46580	A nocebo is a harmless thing, like a video with non-existent hypersounds, that causes
46580	49840	harm like a headache because you believe it's harmful.
49840	53480	That sounds like voodoo, but there's real science behind the nocebo effect, which is
53480	55540	more than an irritating parlor trick.
55540	58380	It causes real problems, like in medicine.
58380	61740	When testing a new drug, doctors get a group of sick people, give half of them the new
61740	66780	drug and give the other half a fake pill that does nothing but which they're told is real.
66780	70580	This is how science finds the stuff that works amongst the junk that doesn't.
70580	74500	But new drugs have side effects, and sometimes patients drop out of the experiment because
74500	75500	of them.
75500	76620	No surprise there.
76620	80620	But some people on the fake also drop out from the side effects.
80620	84300	Side effects they've gotten from a drug they aren't taking, but because they think they're
84300	88260	on the real thing, they've also thought themselves into the side effects.
88260	90540	Now maybe this is just a case of misattribution.
90540	93740	People get headaches, and if they've joined a drug trial that lists headaches in the side
93740	98320	effects, it's natural to blame the new drug, and that certainly happens to some extent.
98320	101100	But the nocebo effect is more than just misattribution.
101100	106060	It causes real additional harm that scientists can measure in cruel, cruel experiments.
106060	110020	And this is one of the reasons there's not an overabundance of research on nocebos.
110020	113500	Approach your friendly neighborhood ethics board with an experiment designed to hurt
113500	115540	people and they'll frown on that.
115540	119600	But sometimes nocebo experiments do get approved to the benefit of science and humanity, if
119600	120900	not the participants.
120900	124340	For example, under the right conditions, some people who expect a harmless injection will
124340	128520	give them a rash will get a rash, but for people who expect nothing to happen, nothing
128520	130400	is exactly what happens.
130400	132100	And fake pills can be addictive.
132100	136460	Take test subjects off pills they believe are addictive and some will experience nocebic
136460	140960	withdrawal symptoms like pain and fatigue from pills they could never have been addicted
140960	142460	to in the first place.
142460	146180	Another experiment gave people harmless injections, told half of them to sit there, and told the
146180	150320	other half their pain would increase for the next 30 minutes, which it did.
150320	154140	But in this situation, there's a drug that can block the nocebo effect, and those who
154140	159060	were told the injection would hurt, but were also secretly given a nocebo-blocking drug
159060	163900	did not report an increase in pain, showing that the nocebo effect is a real, physical
163900	164900	process.
164900	168060	In all these nocebo experiments, it's the belief in harm that matters.
168060	171660	If someone dressed as a voodoo witch doctor popped up and hexed you with a curse of great
171660	173140	pain, no effect.
173140	177480	But in a room with a real doctor and his clipboard and a big science machine and a needle in
177480	180500	your arm, you'll take his words rather more seriously.
180500	184460	Which is why doctors say, this won't hurt a bit, rather than, oh this?
184460	185540	It's going to hurt.
185540	186540	Like a lot.
186540	192340	Which, by the way, was a real experiment done on women undergoing labor during spinal injections.
192340	193600	Guess how that turned out.
193600	195260	But nocebos don't end here.
195260	199500	While illnesses like the flu spread from contact with disgusting germ-infected humans and the
199500	204140	things they touch with their disgusting, germy hands, a nocebo spreads from mind to
204140	206180	mind, no contact required.
206180	208820	A notable example happened in a Tennessee high school.
208820	212740	One teacher reported a strange smell in her classroom and developed symptoms of headache,
212740	214620	nausea, and difficulty breathing.
214620	218900	These symptoms spread to some of her students and from them to others in the school.
218900	224180	Almost 200 people ended up at the local hospital, but all medical tests came back with nothing,
224180	227040	nor was anything harmful found at the school.
227040	232760	This was a nocebo, the belief that the air was making them sick spread from mind to mind.
232760	236360	Everyone who got sick heard about the symptoms from someone else.
236360	239600	When this happens, it's called mass psychogenic illness.
239600	243780	The treatment in these cases is to separate those with symptoms from the rest and reassure
243780	247980	the ill that yes, their symptoms are real, but no, they haven't been exposed to anything
247980	251300	toxic and yes, people are getting better quickly.
251300	255700	This last is one of the indicators that separates a real poison gas leak or biological weapon
255700	257460	from mass psychogenic illness.
257460	261620	But the final factor, number of cases increasing with greater media coverage, can lead to this
261620	264260	kind of thing spreading far and wide.
264260	268620	Take electro-sensitives, people who get nausea, among other things, from exposure to parts
268620	274180	of the electromagnetic spectrum, notably Wi-Fi, the density of which is increasing over time,
274180	278760	forcing particularly bad sufferers to retreat to places like the creepy sounding radio silent
278760	281380	zone in, where else, West Virginia.
281380	285420	You put electro-sensitives in a room with a Wi-Fi router and they can't actually tell
285420	288100	via their symptoms if it's on or off.
288100	292200	Instead, their symptoms track with being told if it's on or off.
292200	295720	And if you make a group of people without electro-sensitivity watch a news report on
295720	300140	how Wi-Fi makes you ill while another group watches something uninformative and afterward
300140	305220	expose both groups to a fake Wi-Fi signal, only those who watch the news report feel
305220	306220	sick.
306220	309180	There's a similar phenomenon called wind farm disease with similar side effects which
309180	313380	turns up where it's been talked about on the local news but not in other places in
313380	316540	the same country with the same wind farms where it isn't.
316540	320300	All this makes it too easy to mock people for thinking they're getting sick from Wi-Fi
320300	325400	or wind farms or wind farms with Wi-Fi but it's important to realize they're not crazy.
325400	328820	The side effects are real, they're just wrong about the source.
328820	334380	All evidence points to the belief in electro-sensitivity as the cause of electro-sensitivity.
334380	338060	Which means the news reports talking about these illnesses are spreading a kind of mind
338060	342580	virus and while these are exotic examples there's also evidence that some allergies
342580	347060	and asthma cases are nocebic and thus able to be spread in the same way.
347060	350860	To be clear, if someone's having an asthma attack that's not the time to tell them you
350860	354940	know they're being a drama llama because you watched an internet video about the nocebo
354940	355940	effect.
355940	359820	They're really having an asthma attack and they really need something to make it stop
359820	363280	and that's really not you showing off your knowledge.
363280	366300	Harmful things aren't just harmful because we believe they are.
366300	370260	The right dose of arsenic will kill you just as surely as an anvil to the head no matter
370260	374860	your insistence otherwise but the nocebo effect does show that our beliefs about otherwise
374860	377220	harmless things can make them harmful.
377220	381280	Which means that our voodoo doctor's hex from before really could work but only if you were
381280	382780	foolish enough to believe him.
396300	398380	you
