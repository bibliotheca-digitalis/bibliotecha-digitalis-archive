00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
Please, put on your headphones.

00:01.960 --> 00:06.520
I promise there won't be any loud sounds, but this video is going to hurt.

00:06.520 --> 00:09.460
There's a study about hypersounds and how they cause headaches.

00:09.460 --> 00:14.160
These sounds are too high-pitched to hear, like the one added to this video playing right

00:14.160 --> 00:16.700
now, but cause headaches they still do.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.940
The hypersound in your headphones is pressing on your inner ear, stressing the nerves leading

00:20.940 --> 00:25.880
to your brain where, if the headache hasn't started already, it soon will as exposure

00:25.880 --> 00:28.480
causes headaches after only 10 seconds.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.620
Oh my.

00:29.620 --> 00:30.620
Can you feel it?

00:30.620 --> 00:33.700
That pressure in your ears spreading to your now-throbbing brain?

00:33.700 --> 00:34.920
Because you shouldn't.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.100
This study is made up, and there's no hypersound in the audio, but some of you will still have

00:39.100 --> 00:40.740
begun to feel a headache.

00:40.740 --> 00:41.740
Why?

00:41.740 --> 00:42.740
The nocebo effect.

00:42.740 --> 00:46.580
A nocebo is a harmless thing, like a video with non-existent hypersounds, that causes

00:46.580 --> 00:49.840
harm like a headache because you believe it's harmful.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.480
That sounds like voodoo, but there's real science behind the nocebo effect, which is

00:53.480 --> 00:55.540
more than an irritating parlor trick.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.380
It causes real problems, like in medicine.

00:58.380 --> 01:01.740
When testing a new drug, doctors get a group of sick people, give half of them the new

01:01.740 --> 01:06.780
drug and give the other half a fake pill that does nothing but which they're told is real.

01:06.780 --> 01:10.580
This is how science finds the stuff that works amongst the junk that doesn't.

01:10.580 --> 01:14.500
But new drugs have side effects, and sometimes patients drop out of the experiment because

01:14.500 --> 01:15.500
of them.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.620
No surprise there.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.620
But some people on the fake also drop out from the side effects.

01:20.620 --> 01:24.300
Side effects they've gotten from a drug they aren't taking, but because they think they're

01:24.300 --> 01:28.260
on the real thing, they've also thought themselves into the side effects.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.540
Now maybe this is just a case of misattribution.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.740
People get headaches, and if they've joined a drug trial that lists headaches in the side

01:33.740 --> 01:38.320
effects, it's natural to blame the new drug, and that certainly happens to some extent.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.100
But the nocebo effect is more than just misattribution.

01:41.100 --> 01:46.060
It causes real additional harm that scientists can measure in cruel, cruel experiments.

01:46.060 --> 01:50.020
And this is one of the reasons there's not an overabundance of research on nocebos.

01:50.020 --> 01:53.500
Approach your friendly neighborhood ethics board with an experiment designed to hurt

01:53.500 --> 01:55.540
people and they'll frown on that.

01:55.540 --> 01:59.600
But sometimes nocebo experiments do get approved to the benefit of science and humanity, if

01:59.600 --> 02:00.900
not the participants.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.340
For example, under the right conditions, some people who expect a harmless injection will

02:04.340 --> 02:08.520
give them a rash will get a rash, but for people who expect nothing to happen, nothing

02:08.520 --> 02:10.400
is exactly what happens.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.100
And fake pills can be addictive.

02:12.100 --> 02:16.460
Take test subjects off pills they believe are addictive and some will experience nocebic

02:16.460 --> 02:20.960
withdrawal symptoms like pain and fatigue from pills they could never have been addicted

02:20.960 --> 02:22.460
to in the first place.

02:22.460 --> 02:26.180
Another experiment gave people harmless injections, told half of them to sit there, and told the

02:26.180 --> 02:30.320
other half their pain would increase for the next 30 minutes, which it did.

02:30.320 --> 02:34.140
But in this situation, there's a drug that can block the nocebo effect, and those who

02:34.140 --> 02:39.060
were told the injection would hurt, but were also secretly given a nocebo-blocking drug

02:39.060 --> 02:43.900
did not report an increase in pain, showing that the nocebo effect is a real, physical

02:43.900 --> 02:44.900
process.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.060
In all these nocebo experiments, it's the belief in harm that matters.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.660
If someone dressed as a voodoo witch doctor popped up and hexed you with a curse of great

02:51.660 --> 02:53.140
pain, no effect.

02:53.140 --> 02:57.480
But in a room with a real doctor and his clipboard and a big science machine and a needle in

02:57.480 --> 03:00.500
your arm, you'll take his words rather more seriously.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.460
Which is why doctors say, this won't hurt a bit, rather than, oh this?

03:04.460 --> 03:05.540
It's going to hurt.

03:05.540 --> 03:06.540
Like a lot.

03:06.540 --> 03:12.340
Which, by the way, was a real experiment done on women undergoing labor during spinal injections.

03:12.340 --> 03:13.600
Guess how that turned out.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.260
But nocebos don't end here.

03:15.260 --> 03:19.500
While illnesses like the flu spread from contact with disgusting germ-infected humans and the

03:19.500 --> 03:24.140
things they touch with their disgusting, germy hands, a nocebo spreads from mind to

03:24.140 --> 03:26.180
mind, no contact required.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.820
A notable example happened in a Tennessee high school.

03:28.820 --> 03:32.740
One teacher reported a strange smell in her classroom and developed symptoms of headache,

03:32.740 --> 03:34.620
nausea, and difficulty breathing.

03:34.620 --> 03:38.900
These symptoms spread to some of her students and from them to others in the school.

03:38.900 --> 03:44.180
Almost 200 people ended up at the local hospital, but all medical tests came back with nothing,

03:44.180 --> 03:47.040
nor was anything harmful found at the school.

03:47.040 --> 03:52.760
This was a nocebo, the belief that the air was making them sick spread from mind to mind.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.360
Everyone who got sick heard about the symptoms from someone else.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.600
When this happens, it's called mass psychogenic illness.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.780
The treatment in these cases is to separate those with symptoms from the rest and reassure

04:03.780 --> 04:07.980
the ill that yes, their symptoms are real, but no, they haven't been exposed to anything

04:07.980 --> 04:11.300
toxic and yes, people are getting better quickly.

04:11.300 --> 04:15.700
This last is one of the indicators that separates a real poison gas leak or biological weapon

04:15.700 --> 04:17.460
from mass psychogenic illness.

04:17.460 --> 04:21.620
But the final factor, number of cases increasing with greater media coverage, can lead to this

04:21.620 --> 04:24.260
kind of thing spreading far and wide.

04:24.260 --> 04:28.620
Take electro-sensitives, people who get nausea, among other things, from exposure to parts

04:28.620 --> 04:34.180
of the electromagnetic spectrum, notably Wi-Fi, the density of which is increasing over time,

04:34.180 --> 04:38.760
forcing particularly bad sufferers to retreat to places like the creepy sounding radio silent

04:38.760 --> 04:41.380
zone in, where else, West Virginia.

04:41.380 --> 04:45.420
You put electro-sensitives in a room with a Wi-Fi router and they can't actually tell

04:45.420 --> 04:48.100
via their symptoms if it's on or off.

04:48.100 --> 04:52.200
Instead, their symptoms track with being told if it's on or off.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.720
And if you make a group of people without electro-sensitivity watch a news report on

04:55.720 --> 05:00.140
how Wi-Fi makes you ill while another group watches something uninformative and afterward

05:00.140 --> 05:05.220
expose both groups to a fake Wi-Fi signal, only those who watch the news report feel

05:05.220 --> 05:06.220
sick.

05:06.220 --> 05:09.180
There's a similar phenomenon called wind farm disease with similar side effects which

05:09.180 --> 05:13.380
turns up where it's been talked about on the local news but not in other places in

05:13.380 --> 05:16.540
the same country with the same wind farms where it isn't.

05:16.540 --> 05:20.300
All this makes it too easy to mock people for thinking they're getting sick from Wi-Fi

05:20.300 --> 05:25.400
or wind farms or wind farms with Wi-Fi but it's important to realize they're not crazy.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.820
The side effects are real, they're just wrong about the source.

05:28.820 --> 05:34.380
All evidence points to the belief in electro-sensitivity as the cause of electro-sensitivity.

05:34.380 --> 05:38.060
Which means the news reports talking about these illnesses are spreading a kind of mind

05:38.060 --> 05:42.580
virus and while these are exotic examples there's also evidence that some allergies

05:42.580 --> 05:47.060
and asthma cases are nocebic and thus able to be spread in the same way.

05:47.060 --> 05:50.860
To be clear, if someone's having an asthma attack that's not the time to tell them you

05:50.860 --> 05:54.940
know they're being a drama llama because you watched an internet video about the nocebo

05:54.940 --> 05:55.940
effect.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.820
They're really having an asthma attack and they really need something to make it stop

05:59.820 --> 06:03.280
and that's really not you showing off your knowledge.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.300
Harmful things aren't just harmful because we believe they are.

06:06.300 --> 06:10.260
The right dose of arsenic will kill you just as surely as an anvil to the head no matter

06:10.260 --> 06:14.860
your insistence otherwise but the nocebo effect does show that our beliefs about otherwise

06:14.860 --> 06:17.220
harmless things can make them harmful.

06:17.220 --> 06:21.280
Which means that our voodoo doctor's hex from before really could work but only if you were

06:21.280 --> 06:22.780
foolish enough to believe him.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.380
you
