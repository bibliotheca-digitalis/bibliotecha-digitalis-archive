0	4420	Welcome to the great nation of Holland, where the tulips grow, the windmills turn, the breakfast
4420	8120	is chocolatey, the people industrious and the sea tries to drown it all.
8120	10040	Except this country isn't Holland.
10040	13800	It's time for the difference between Holland, the Netherlands and a whole lot more.
13800	17240	The correct name for this tulip growing, windmill building, hagelslag eating, container ship
17240	19880	moving, ocean conquering nation is the Netherlands.
19880	21360	But confusion is understandable.
21360	25680	The general region has been renamed a lot over a thousand years including as the Dutch
25680	29480	Republic, the United States of Belgium and the Kingdom of Holland.
29480	33000	But it's not just history that makes this country's name confusing, because the Netherlands
33000	34960	is divided into 12 provinces.
34960	39400	Groningen, Trenta, Oferhessel, Helderland, Limburg, Nord, Brabant, Zeeland, which by
39400	43000	the way is the Zeeland that makes this Zeeland new, Friesland with adorable little hearts
43000	48820	on its flags, Flevoland, Utrecht and here's the confusion, Nord, North-Holland and Saude-South-Holland.
48820	52640	These provinces make calling the Netherlands Holland like calling the United States Dakota.
52640	56340	Though unlike the Dakotas, which are mostly empty, save for the occasional jackalope,
56340	60500	the two Hollands are the most populated provinces and have some of the biggest attractions like
60500	62340	Amsterdam and Kockenhof.
62340	65940	Chances are, if it's Dutch and you've heard of it, it's in one of the Hollands.
65940	69780	Even the government's travel website for the country is holland.com, officially because
69780	74040	it sounds friendlier but unofficially it's probably what people are actually searching
74040	75040	for.
75040	78480	Confusion continues because people who live in the Hollands are called Hollanders, but
78480	81820	all citizens of the Netherlands are called Dutch as is their language.
81820	86280	But in Dutch they say, Nederlands sprechened Nederlanders in Nederland, which sounds like
86280	89400	they'd rather we call them Netherlanders speaking Netherlandish.
89400	93040	Meanwhile next door in Germany they're Deutschesprechen Deutsch in Deutschland, which sounds like
93040	94800	they'd rather be called Dutch.
94800	98480	This linguistic confusion is why Americans call the Pennsylvania Dutch Dutch even though
98480	99580	they're Germans.
99580	103360	To review, this country is the Netherlands, it's people are Dutch and they speak Dutch.
103360	107760	There is no country called Holland but there are provinces of North and South Holland.
107760	108760	Got it?
108760	110420	Great because it's about to get more complicated.
110420	113760	The Netherlands is part of a kingdom with the same name, the Kingdom of the Netherlands
113760	115780	which is headed by the Dutch Royal Family.
116280	119220	The Kingdom of the Netherlands contains three more countries and to find them we must sail
119220	123220	from the icy North Sea to the Caribbean and Aruba, Currico and Saint Martin.
123220	126780	These are no territories but self-governing countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands
126780	130000	and as such they have their own governments and their own currencies.
130000	133620	Geography geek side note here, while Aruba and Currico are islands, Saint Martin is just
133620	138060	the southern half of a tiny island also named Saint Martin, the other half of which is occupied
138060	140980	by France and also named Saint Martin.
140980	144260	So despite being separated by Belgium on the European map, the Kingdom of the Netherlands
144260	147340	and the French Republic share a border on the other side of the world on an island so
147340	149080	nice they named it thrice.
149080	152340	But why does the Kingdom of the Netherlands reach to the Caribbean anyway?
152340	153600	Because empire.
153600	157340	In the 1600s the Dutch, always looking to expand business, laid their hands on every
157340	158900	valuable port they could.
158900	163100	For a time America's east coast was New Netherland with its capital city of New Amsterdam.
163100	167380	There was New Zealand as mentioned previously and nearby the King of the Islands, New Holland.
167380	170740	Though the empire is gone these three Caribbean nations remain.
170740	174340	And while four countries in one kingdom isn't unheard of, it doesn't stop there because
174340	178740	the country of the Netherlands also extends its borders to the Caribbean and three more
178740	179740	islands.
179740	181300	Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba.
181300	185380	These are not countries in a kingdom but are cities in the country of the Netherlands and
185380	186580	they look the part.
186580	190120	Residents of these far flung cities vote in elections with the Dutch government just as
190120	191280	any Hollander would.
191280	196420	Though weirdly they don't belong to any province and they don't use the Dutch currency of euros,
196420	198020	they use dollars instead.
198020	201740	Kind of like if Hawaii wasn't a state but technically part of the District of Columbia
201740	203720	all the while using yen.
203720	206980	These cities of the country of the Netherlands and these countries in the Kingdom of the
206980	209620	Netherlands are together known as the Dutch Caribbean.
209620	213020	And their citizens are Dutch citizens which, because the Kingdom of the Netherlands is
213020	218060	a member of the European Union, means that these Dutch Caribbeans are also Europeans.
218060	220360	So in the end there are six Caribbean islands.
220360	224300	Four countries, twelve provinces, two Hollands, two Netherlands and one Kingdom.
224300	225060	All Dutch.
