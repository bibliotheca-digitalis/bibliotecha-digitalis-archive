1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
Welcome to the great nation of Holland, where the tulips grow, the windmills turn, the breakfast

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,120
is chocolatey, the people industrious and the sea tries to drown it all.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,040
Except this country isn't Holland.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,800
It's time for the difference between Holland, the Netherlands and a whole lot more.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,240
The correct name for this tulip growing, windmill building, hagelslag eating, container ship

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,880
moving, ocean conquering nation is the Netherlands.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,360
But confusion is understandable.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,680
The general region has been renamed a lot over a thousand years including as the Dutch

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,480
Republic, the United States of Belgium and the Kingdom of Holland.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,000
But it's not just history that makes this country's name confusing, because the Netherlands

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,960
is divided into 12 provinces.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,400
Groningen, Trenta, Oferhessel, Helderland, Limburg, Nord, Brabant, Zeeland, which by

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,000
the way is the Zeeland that makes this Zeeland new, Friesland with adorable little hearts

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,820
on its flags, Flevoland, Utrecht and here's the confusion, Nord, North-Holland and Saude-South-Holland.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,640
These provinces make calling the Netherlands Holland like calling the United States Dakota.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,340
Though unlike the Dakotas, which are mostly empty, save for the occasional jackalope,

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,500
the two Hollands are the most populated provinces and have some of the biggest attractions like

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,340
Amsterdam and Kockenhof.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,940
Chances are, if it's Dutch and you've heard of it, it's in one of the Hollands.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,780
Even the government's travel website for the country is holland.com, officially because

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,040
it sounds friendlier but unofficially it's probably what people are actually searching

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
for.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,480
Confusion continues because people who live in the Hollands are called Hollanders, but

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,820
all citizens of the Netherlands are called Dutch as is their language.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,280
But in Dutch they say, Nederlands sprechened Nederlanders in Nederland, which sounds like

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,400
they'd rather we call them Netherlanders speaking Netherlandish.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,040
Meanwhile next door in Germany they're Deutschesprechen Deutsch in Deutschland, which sounds like

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,800
they'd rather be called Dutch.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,480
This linguistic confusion is why Americans call the Pennsylvania Dutch Dutch even though

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,580
they're Germans.

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,360
To review, this country is the Netherlands, it's people are Dutch and they speak Dutch.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,760
There is no country called Holland but there are provinces of North and South Holland.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Got it?

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,420
Great because it's about to get more complicated.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,760
The Netherlands is part of a kingdom with the same name, the Kingdom of the Netherlands

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,780
which is headed by the Dutch Royal Family.

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,220
The Kingdom of the Netherlands contains three more countries and to find them we must sail

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,220
from the icy North Sea to the Caribbean and Aruba, Currico and Saint Martin.

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,780
These are no territories but self-governing countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands

40
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,000
and as such they have their own governments and their own currencies.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,620
Geography geek side note here, while Aruba and Currico are islands, Saint Martin is just

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,060
the southern half of a tiny island also named Saint Martin, the other half of which is occupied

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,980
by France and also named Saint Martin.

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,260
So despite being separated by Belgium on the European map, the Kingdom of the Netherlands

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,340
and the French Republic share a border on the other side of the world on an island so

46
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,080
nice they named it thrice.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,340
But why does the Kingdom of the Netherlands reach to the Caribbean anyway?

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,600
Because empire.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,340
In the 1600s the Dutch, always looking to expand business, laid their hands on every

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,900
valuable port they could.

51
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,100
For a time America's east coast was New Netherland with its capital city of New Amsterdam.

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,380
There was New Zealand as mentioned previously and nearby the King of the Islands, New Holland.

53
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,740
Though the empire is gone these three Caribbean nations remain.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,340
And while four countries in one kingdom isn't unheard of, it doesn't stop there because

55
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,740
the country of the Netherlands also extends its borders to the Caribbean and three more

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
islands.

57
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,300
Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba.

58
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,380
These are not countries in a kingdom but are cities in the country of the Netherlands and

59
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,580
they look the part.

60
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,120
Residents of these far flung cities vote in elections with the Dutch government just as

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
any Hollander would.

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,420
Though weirdly they don't belong to any province and they don't use the Dutch currency of euros,

63
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,020
they use dollars instead.

64
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,740
Kind of like if Hawaii wasn't a state but technically part of the District of Columbia

65
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,720
all the while using yen.

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,980
These cities of the country of the Netherlands and these countries in the Kingdom of the

67
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,620
Netherlands are together known as the Dutch Caribbean.

68
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,020
And their citizens are Dutch citizens which, because the Kingdom of the Netherlands is

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,060
a member of the European Union, means that these Dutch Caribbeans are also Europeans.

70
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,360
So in the end there are six Caribbean islands.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,300
Four countries, twelve provinces, two Hollands, two Netherlands and one Kingdom.

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,060
All Dutch.
