00:00.000 --> 00:04.420
Welcome to the great nation of Holland, where the tulips grow, the windmills turn, the breakfast

00:04.420 --> 00:08.120
is chocolatey, the people industrious and the sea tries to drown it all.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.040
Except this country isn't Holland.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.800
It's time for the difference between Holland, the Netherlands and a whole lot more.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.240
The correct name for this tulip growing, windmill building, hagelslag eating, container ship

00:17.240 --> 00:19.880
moving, ocean conquering nation is the Netherlands.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.360
But confusion is understandable.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.680
The general region has been renamed a lot over a thousand years including as the Dutch

00:25.680 --> 00:29.480
Republic, the United States of Belgium and the Kingdom of Holland.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.000
But it's not just history that makes this country's name confusing, because the Netherlands

00:33.000 --> 00:34.960
is divided into 12 provinces.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.400
Groningen, Trenta, Oferhessel, Helderland, Limburg, Nord, Brabant, Zeeland, which by

00:39.400 --> 00:43.000
the way is the Zeeland that makes this Zeeland new, Friesland with adorable little hearts

00:43.000 --> 00:48.820
on its flags, Flevoland, Utrecht and here's the confusion, Nord, North-Holland and Saude-South-Holland.

00:48.820 --> 00:52.640
These provinces make calling the Netherlands Holland like calling the United States Dakota.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.340
Though unlike the Dakotas, which are mostly empty, save for the occasional jackalope,

00:56.340 --> 01:00.500
the two Hollands are the most populated provinces and have some of the biggest attractions like

01:00.500 --> 01:02.340
Amsterdam and Kockenhof.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.940
Chances are, if it's Dutch and you've heard of it, it's in one of the Hollands.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.780
Even the government's travel website for the country is holland.com, officially because

01:09.780 --> 01:14.040
it sounds friendlier but unofficially it's probably what people are actually searching

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
for.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.480
Confusion continues because people who live in the Hollands are called Hollanders, but

01:18.480 --> 01:21.820
all citizens of the Netherlands are called Dutch as is their language.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.280
But in Dutch they say, Nederlands sprechened Nederlanders in Nederland, which sounds like

01:26.280 --> 01:29.400
they'd rather we call them Netherlanders speaking Netherlandish.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.040
Meanwhile next door in Germany they're Deutschesprechen Deutsch in Deutschland, which sounds like

01:33.040 --> 01:34.800
they'd rather be called Dutch.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.480
This linguistic confusion is why Americans call the Pennsylvania Dutch Dutch even though

01:38.480 --> 01:39.580
they're Germans.

01:39.580 --> 01:43.360
To review, this country is the Netherlands, it's people are Dutch and they speak Dutch.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.760
There is no country called Holland but there are provinces of North and South Holland.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
Got it?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.420
Great because it's about to get more complicated.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.760
The Netherlands is part of a kingdom with the same name, the Kingdom of the Netherlands

01:53.760 --> 01:55.780
which is headed by the Dutch Royal Family.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.220
The Kingdom of the Netherlands contains three more countries and to find them we must sail

01:59.220 --> 02:03.220
from the icy North Sea to the Caribbean and Aruba, Currico and Saint Martin.

02:03.220 --> 02:06.780
These are no territories but self-governing countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands

02:06.780 --> 02:10.000
and as such they have their own governments and their own currencies.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.620
Geography geek side note here, while Aruba and Currico are islands, Saint Martin is just

02:13.620 --> 02:18.060
the southern half of a tiny island also named Saint Martin, the other half of which is occupied

02:18.060 --> 02:20.980
by France and also named Saint Martin.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.260
So despite being separated by Belgium on the European map, the Kingdom of the Netherlands

02:24.260 --> 02:27.340
and the French Republic share a border on the other side of the world on an island so

02:27.340 --> 02:29.080
nice they named it thrice.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.340
But why does the Kingdom of the Netherlands reach to the Caribbean anyway?

02:32.340 --> 02:33.600
Because empire.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.340
In the 1600s the Dutch, always looking to expand business, laid their hands on every

02:37.340 --> 02:38.900
valuable port they could.

02:38.900 --> 02:43.100
For a time America's east coast was New Netherland with its capital city of New Amsterdam.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.380
There was New Zealand as mentioned previously and nearby the King of the Islands, New Holland.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.740
Though the empire is gone these three Caribbean nations remain.

02:50.740 --> 02:54.340
And while four countries in one kingdom isn't unheard of, it doesn't stop there because

02:54.340 --> 02:58.740
the country of the Netherlands also extends its borders to the Caribbean and three more

02:58.740 --> 02:59.740
islands.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.300
Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba.

03:01.300 --> 03:05.380
These are not countries in a kingdom but are cities in the country of the Netherlands and

03:05.380 --> 03:06.580
they look the part.

03:06.580 --> 03:10.120
Residents of these far flung cities vote in elections with the Dutch government just as

03:10.120 --> 03:11.280
any Hollander would.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.420
Though weirdly they don't belong to any province and they don't use the Dutch currency of euros,

03:16.420 --> 03:18.020
they use dollars instead.

03:18.020 --> 03:21.740
Kind of like if Hawaii wasn't a state but technically part of the District of Columbia

03:21.740 --> 03:23.720
all the while using yen.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.980
These cities of the country of the Netherlands and these countries in the Kingdom of the

03:26.980 --> 03:29.620
Netherlands are together known as the Dutch Caribbean.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.020
And their citizens are Dutch citizens which, because the Kingdom of the Netherlands is

03:33.020 --> 03:38.060
a member of the European Union, means that these Dutch Caribbeans are also Europeans.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.360
So in the end there are six Caribbean islands.

03:40.360 --> 03:44.300
Four countries, twelve provinces, two Hollands, two Netherlands and one Kingdom.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.060
All Dutch.
