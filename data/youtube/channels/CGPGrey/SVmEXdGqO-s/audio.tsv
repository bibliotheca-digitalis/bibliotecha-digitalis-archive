0	5400	Hey. Hey. Hey. Where's the Q&A?
5400	12800	Oh, right. I lost track of time. What year is it?
12800	16800	How are you and Lady Grey doing during lockdown? We're fine, though we have become real little
16800	21280	homebody bots, even more so than normal, after we pulled up the drawbridge of Castle Grey
21280	25600	and settled into our cozy quarantine. But this Q&A is getting ahead of itself.
25600	29880	Hello internet, I hope you're doing alright. Lockdown is a weird, different time for all
29880	34360	of us. And I know I promised this Q&A a while ago, but the problem has been because all
34360	39360	my videos take a long time to make, even Q&A videos, I couldn't know into what state of
39360	44520	the world this final video would set sail. A new dawn rising, or an apocalyptic night
44520	49200	setting? Impossible to know, so let me first give an answer to an unasked question.
49200	53560	How do you make big decisions under uncertainty? For all decisions great and small, two things
53560	57960	are true. One, there are no solutions, only trade-offs. And two, the fog of the future
57960	62480	hides vital information. This second point might sound so obvious it's not worth discussing,
62480	66200	but it's often forgotten when looking back at decisions you've already made, giving a
66200	70880	distorted perspective that decisions were clearer than they really were. When the reality
70880	75560	is chiding yourself on a decision you should have made is sort of pointless, unless you're
75560	80240	trying to learn something new for future decisions. And for something that looks like a novel,
80240	84960	global pandemic out in the fog, well, you're not going to have much information at hand,
84960	89600	and much of what you will have will be contradictory. So what to do? It's often advised to make
89600	94040	a pro and con list when deciding, which is better than nothing I guess, but the format
94040	99940	sort of implies each good thing is about as good as each bad thing is bad. Which is obviously
99940	104480	not true. Unfortunately, most good things have an upper limit to how good they can be,
104480	109640	while bad things can be deeply bad. And a potential pandemic brings that forth with
109640	114280	the spectre of death, the simultaneous murder of every future you that would have been and
114280	119120	you could have been. So for risk calculations, that's like a negative infinity? Which really
119120	124960	complicates things, because death looms everywhere. To live life is to constantly risk death,
124960	130800	often with hilariously unbalanced calculations of you getting some tiny reward versus death
130800	135280	getting to negative infinity you. But there are no solutions, only trade-offs. And with
135280	140240	normal life, the trade-off is you try to ignore death in the banal decisions of your day-to-day
140240	144560	which lets you live life, but the risk is you can become oblivious to normal seeming
144560	149120	things that are really quite deadly. And with a potential new global pandemic out in the
149120	154400	fog, there are a lot of normal seeming things that might turn out to be really quite deadly.
154400	159400	Unfortunately, the information you need about that is also out there in the fog of the future.
159400	163300	Then when infection vectors and transmission rates and lethality and long-term complications
163300	168120	are known, the decision will have been easy and you won't have under or overreacted. But
168120	172160	it's now, and you don't know. There are risks and there are rewards. Everyone's
172160	176360	calculation will be different, but here's how it went for us. On my summer calendar
176360	181600	were a lot of family visits and interesting and unique opportunities that were not replaceable.
181600	187200	Losing those, not good. But for my work, the loner I am, the better it usually goes. And
187200	191840	personally, getting to wipe from my calendar every social obligation without hesitation
191840	198000	or condemnation is not exactly a sacrifice. Meanwhile, the Lady Grey is at unusually
198000	203040	high risk of exactly this sort of pandemic mortality. Normal flu season is already not
203040	207800	fun for us, and this sort of thing potentially looming should make the calculation super
207800	213220	clear for Castle Grey. Lockdown early, lockdown long. But even for us, while we went into
213220	218080	lockdown before our friends, it was still later than we should have in retrospect. Why?
218320	223200	Well, it's that damn fog of the future again. Information at the very start was uncertain
223200	227960	and contradictory. Is this another flu? Well, every flu season is a risk for us, but we
227960	232840	don't lockdown our lives for four months a year, every year, because that's too much
232840	237040	of a trade-off. And with this, we felt a bit silly being the first ones to pull up the
237040	242000	drawbridge and cancel all our plans. Looking back now, it looks like reckless delay, but
242000	247280	of course, that's biased by the information current us now have. And at the time of writing,
247280	251300	we're facing the reverse problem. Lots of people are out and about as though life is
251300	256160	back to normal, and there's pressure to accept invitations and opportunities. But we've learned
256160	260960	from the past about feeling silly, and for us, the risk-reward calculation makes it clear
260960	265640	that we still mustn't be too hasty to lower the drawbridge. That's the way for Castle
265640	270960	Grey, but an individual case can be easy in a way the civilizational case is not. So for
270960	276920	that, let's discuss a theoretical global pandemic, not this particular global pandemic, and how
276920	281540	countries have to make decisions under the fog of the future, multiplied by millions
281540	287300	of people. So is that a new global pandemic on the path? It's a little hard to see. Maybe
287300	291960	it's another annual flu, which kills just a quarter to half million people a year, or
291960	297240	maybe it's another Spanish flu that kills 25 to 50 million. Or maybe it's that once
297240	303640	in a millennia plague, 100 to 200 million. Those are big risks, so countries should lock
303640	308460	down immediately, right? Well, lockdowns are used because they're better at slowing a plague
308460	314880	than nothing, but impermeable they are not. A good lockdown is best spent to buy time
314880	319440	to work out better treatments, which, if a country locks down early and hard enough,
319440	323560	and a treatment comes, that lockdown might save millions from the next plague, assuming
323560	328820	it is a plague. But a hard lockdown will damage the economy. Now, you might think the economy
328820	333300	is the moneyed class checking their stocks on their smartphones, which it is. But it's
333300	338660	also a measure of everything humans do that other humans value enough to pay for, which
338660	343980	is a lot, and includes the people and companies and governments working on better treatments,
343980	349440	and all the people and companies and governments they depend on to be able to do that job.
349440	355380	National lockdown guarantees large economic harm immediately, and the downward curve of
355380	360460	that harm accelerates. So a country needs to weigh that known harm against an upwardly
360460	365760	accelerating curve of death, or potential death. Because even in this video, this way
365760	371060	of talking about a potential pandemic and drawing it out in the fog is too clear. In
371060	376340	reality, there's uncertain stories in a faraway place about how a dozen people might be sick
376340	381220	from something maybe new. Based on that, if you were in charge of a country, would you
381220	386940	press the lockdown button and cause guaranteed economic harm immediately? I don't know.
386940	391420	And of course, there isn't a lockdown button. That's, again, just a simplified way to talk
391420	398060	about the huge number of policy dials at hand. Which to turn up and which to turn down. Some
398060	402660	really matter, others don't. And you don't know which is which, and underneath they're
402660	407480	all interconnected in non-linear ways. Don't mess up. Oh, and keep in mind, you will be
407480	411480	judged not about how good the decision was at the time, given the knowledge and trade-offs
411480	415480	at the time, but you will be judged in the future by those looking backward, where there
415480	420760	is no fog, and it was just so clear and obvious what to do. How could you possibly have not
420760	425540	known that this was the next plague? Slash, there was nothing to worry about all along.
425540	429640	Decisions under uncertainty are hard. Okay, well that was fun. Now on to some possibly
429640	433600	tonally inappropriately chipper questions. Has lockdown affected Tumbleweed? I don't
433600	437080	know, but I don't doubt they're taking full advantage of the situation. How much do you
437080	441720	think the world will change because of lockdown? Long term, not a lot? It's easy when in the
441720	446000	middle of a storm to think, wow, this is going to change everything forever. But when the
446000	450040	weather clears, people just go back to their regular lives, and it's always, dear Princess
450040	453940	Celestia, I didn't learn a thing. I mean, that's often the best case. What surprised
453940	458360	me most, but really shouldn't have, is how little time it took for the pandemic to go
458360	463560	from, this is a humanity scale problem we must solve as a global humanity, to fracturing
463560	468240	in the usual, tiresome ways with two groups each creating a totem they can yell about
468240	473240	how the other side is not just dumb, but maliciously evil, which is very helpful. So I guess I
473240	477260	actually expect the next time round it will be worse because everyone living through this
477260	482160	pandemic now will have picked their pandemic tribe when before they didn't have one. What
482160	486480	do you miss most about going outside? Taking a walk is really useful. Stuck on a problem
486480	490360	or feeling anxious or just need a break? A little walk is the perfect solution in a way
490360	495220	a treadmill desk just can't replicate. Even with a VR helmet. I've tried. How do you feel
495220	498940	about the state of VR? I bought my first set at the start of this lockdown and it was one
498940	504440	of the best decisions I've ever made. VR Done Well is truly a new medium to add to the list
504440	509320	of film and books and even traditional gaming. It's just such a distinct experience, and
509320	514560	especially when inside for weeks or months on end, it's pretty good at tricking your
514560	518880	brain into thinking you've gone somewhere else. The technology was overhyped for two
518880	523840	decades, but this is the start of something real and virtual reality, along with augmented
523840	529100	reality, is something I am pumped to see improve over the next two decades. What's the fifth
529100	533520	most important station on Spaceship U? The coffee station, obviously. What about lockdown
533520	538900	do you enjoy the most? It's an amazing feeling of freedom to have a completely empty calendar.
538900	543640	It makes me think of the end of the school year, both as a student and teacher. So excited
543640	548120	to leave the pseudo prison and all its pointless busy work and obligations. The structure of
548120	553200	the human-imposed world fading away, leaving me alone to be alone. But summer can only
553200	558180	be a season long. Eventually, school and its torturous tedium would return. And so it goes
558180	563720	with pandemic season. The human-imposed world will return, but the interregnum is nice.
563720	567420	How will lockdown affect education in the future? Well, I think primary and secondary
567420	572200	school at least will be pretty unaffected, as we all jointly agree to pretend their primary
572200	577000	purpose is education, not babysitification. But I think this quarantine has made plain
577000	582400	some of the necessary lies of civilization around education, particularly higher education.
582400	586920	But I leave what those are as an exercise for the viewer, for now. Your Spaceship U
586920	590440	video made it seem like you have it all sorted in these strange times. How sorted would you
590440	594800	say you feel? Have you broken any of your rules? Well, I feel pretty sorted, but I've
594800	599320	been preparing for this my whole life, so I'm in a fortunate situation. However, part
599320	603680	of the reason I made the Spaceship U video is because I was thinking of my younger self.
603680	609360	When I first moved to London, I had college loans, no income, no job prospects, no social
609360	614620	contacts, no real plans, just a room and shared accommodations. Those first few months in
614620	620940	London were hard, and had a global lockdown occurred then, it would have been a dark situation.
620940	624960	So that video was a bit of a message in a bottle for my younger self of, hey, here's
624960	629080	a bunch of stuff that will work for you. Do this and save yourself years of figuring it
629080	633800	out. Because, spoiler, Spaceship U isn't just a way to think about lockdown, it's
633800	638560	a way to think about your whole life. Now, obviously, my past self doesn't exist because
638560	642720	the past doesn't exist, so I can't send him a message. But human personality matrices
642720	647760	are limited in possibility, so there are guaranteed to be lots of similar people who would be
647760	652200	similarly receptive. As for the second part, the rules get broken, but I don't call them
652200	657220	rules in the video on purpose. They're targets. And the thing about a target is, no matter
657220	662620	how good you are, no one hits the bullseye every time. A target is about taking aim.
662620	666660	Have you actually placed colorful tape around the house to mark your zones? No, but I did
666660	671900	buy paint to make my office dark blue, the color I most associate with important work.
671900	676000	It's the best way for me to make this part of my apartment feel as different from the
676000	680540	rest as possible. What's the best board game for family quarantine time? Oh, why Settlers
680540	684580	of Catan, of course. If you haven't tried it, you really should. If you were a virus,
684580	689580	what would your goal be? To become irreplaceably symbiotic. Hitching a ride on the future of
689580	694420	humanity is a better path to long-term survival than killing your host. Viruses don't make
694420	699020	plans, they just are, but they do tend to become less fatal over time for this very
699020	704660	reason. Has the lockdown affected your schedule? Oh yes, has it. I've made a calendaring discovery
704660	709660	so great, so monumental, I've pulled it out of this Q&A because I want to propagandize
709660	714900	it as far and wide as possible. What home-based exercises have given you the most benefit?
714900	718800	Without a doubt, weights. It's simple and has the best return on investment. I don't
718800	724020	like exercise, I never have, but a little set of weights have a lot going for them.
724020	729000	You can start way easy and make spreadsheetable progress quickly. Get yourself some dumbbells
729000	734140	and a pull-up bar and you have maybe 65% the benefits of a gym without having to leave
734140	738620	home. Are handshakes gone for good? I hope so, but doubt it. I can only say they're gone
738620	744380	for good for me. Has lockdown impacted your projects? Oh yes. So last year I started working
744380	749860	on videos for a playlist called Grey Goes Outside and I had a really big Summer of Grey
749860	754940	planned for some videos that were going to go on there and trips related to current projects
754940	762420	and new places to visit and try to show people. But then, yeah, global pandemic. My lockdown
762420	766660	question for everyone has been, when do you think you will next get on an airplane? I'm
766660	771240	curious for everyone's answers because I don't know what the answer is for myself.
771240	775500	How long will it be before I can visit an interesting place? I just don't know. The
775500	780860	fog of the future at this moment in time is just too dense. But I'll put that playlist
780860	786820	up on the screen now if you too are in lockdown and need a bit of vicarious outside viewing.
786820	788660	See you next time, internet. Stay safe.
796660	798660	You
