00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
Hey. Hey. Hey. Where's the Q&A?

00:05.400 --> 00:12.800
Oh, right. I lost track of time. What year is it?

00:12.800 --> 00:16.800
How are you and Lady Grey doing during lockdown? We're fine, though we have become real little

00:16.800 --> 00:21.280
homebody bots, even more so than normal, after we pulled up the drawbridge of Castle Grey

00:21.280 --> 00:25.600
and settled into our cozy quarantine. But this Q&A is getting ahead of itself.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.880
Hello internet, I hope you're doing alright. Lockdown is a weird, different time for all

00:29.880 --> 00:34.360
of us. And I know I promised this Q&A a while ago, but the problem has been because all

00:34.360 --> 00:39.360
my videos take a long time to make, even Q&A videos, I couldn't know into what state of

00:39.360 --> 00:44.520
the world this final video would set sail. A new dawn rising, or an apocalyptic night

00:44.520 --> 00:49.200
setting? Impossible to know, so let me first give an answer to an unasked question.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.560
How do you make big decisions under uncertainty? For all decisions great and small, two things

00:53.560 --> 00:57.960
are true. One, there are no solutions, only trade-offs. And two, the fog of the future

00:57.960 --> 01:02.480
hides vital information. This second point might sound so obvious it's not worth discussing,

01:02.480 --> 01:06.200
but it's often forgotten when looking back at decisions you've already made, giving a

01:06.200 --> 01:10.880
distorted perspective that decisions were clearer than they really were. When the reality

01:10.880 --> 01:15.560
is chiding yourself on a decision you should have made is sort of pointless, unless you're

01:15.560 --> 01:20.240
trying to learn something new for future decisions. And for something that looks like a novel,

01:20.240 --> 01:24.960
global pandemic out in the fog, well, you're not going to have much information at hand,

01:24.960 --> 01:29.600
and much of what you will have will be contradictory. So what to do? It's often advised to make

01:29.600 --> 01:34.040
a pro and con list when deciding, which is better than nothing I guess, but the format

01:34.040 --> 01:39.940
sort of implies each good thing is about as good as each bad thing is bad. Which is obviously

01:39.940 --> 01:44.480
not true. Unfortunately, most good things have an upper limit to how good they can be,

01:44.480 --> 01:49.640
while bad things can be deeply bad. And a potential pandemic brings that forth with

01:49.640 --> 01:54.280
the spectre of death, the simultaneous murder of every future you that would have been and

01:54.280 --> 01:59.120
you could have been. So for risk calculations, that's like a negative infinity? Which really

01:59.120 --> 02:04.960
complicates things, because death looms everywhere. To live life is to constantly risk death,

02:04.960 --> 02:10.800
often with hilariously unbalanced calculations of you getting some tiny reward versus death

02:10.800 --> 02:15.280
getting to negative infinity you. But there are no solutions, only trade-offs. And with

02:15.280 --> 02:20.240
normal life, the trade-off is you try to ignore death in the banal decisions of your day-to-day

02:20.240 --> 02:24.560
which lets you live life, but the risk is you can become oblivious to normal seeming

02:24.560 --> 02:29.120
things that are really quite deadly. And with a potential new global pandemic out in the

02:29.120 --> 02:34.400
fog, there are a lot of normal seeming things that might turn out to be really quite deadly.

02:34.400 --> 02:39.400
Unfortunately, the information you need about that is also out there in the fog of the future.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.300
Then when infection vectors and transmission rates and lethality and long-term complications

02:43.300 --> 02:48.120
are known, the decision will have been easy and you won't have under or overreacted. But

02:48.120 --> 02:52.160
it's now, and you don't know. There are risks and there are rewards. Everyone's

02:52.160 --> 02:56.360
calculation will be different, but here's how it went for us. On my summer calendar

02:56.360 --> 03:01.600
were a lot of family visits and interesting and unique opportunities that were not replaceable.

03:01.600 --> 03:07.200
Losing those, not good. But for my work, the loner I am, the better it usually goes. And

03:07.200 --> 03:11.840
personally, getting to wipe from my calendar every social obligation without hesitation

03:11.840 --> 03:18.000
or condemnation is not exactly a sacrifice. Meanwhile, the Lady Grey is at unusually

03:18.000 --> 03:23.040
high risk of exactly this sort of pandemic mortality. Normal flu season is already not

03:23.040 --> 03:27.800
fun for us, and this sort of thing potentially looming should make the calculation super

03:27.800 --> 03:33.220
clear for Castle Grey. Lockdown early, lockdown long. But even for us, while we went into

03:33.220 --> 03:38.080
lockdown before our friends, it was still later than we should have in retrospect. Why?

03:38.320 --> 03:43.200
Well, it's that damn fog of the future again. Information at the very start was uncertain

03:43.200 --> 03:47.960
and contradictory. Is this another flu? Well, every flu season is a risk for us, but we

03:47.960 --> 03:52.840
don't lockdown our lives for four months a year, every year, because that's too much

03:52.840 --> 03:57.040
of a trade-off. And with this, we felt a bit silly being the first ones to pull up the

03:57.040 --> 04:02.000
drawbridge and cancel all our plans. Looking back now, it looks like reckless delay, but

04:02.000 --> 04:07.280
of course, that's biased by the information current us now have. And at the time of writing,

04:07.280 --> 04:11.300
we're facing the reverse problem. Lots of people are out and about as though life is

04:11.300 --> 04:16.160
back to normal, and there's pressure to accept invitations and opportunities. But we've learned

04:16.160 --> 04:20.960
from the past about feeling silly, and for us, the risk-reward calculation makes it clear

04:20.960 --> 04:25.640
that we still mustn't be too hasty to lower the drawbridge. That's the way for Castle

04:25.640 --> 04:30.960
Grey, but an individual case can be easy in a way the civilizational case is not. So for

04:30.960 --> 04:36.920
that, let's discuss a theoretical global pandemic, not this particular global pandemic, and how

04:36.920 --> 04:41.540
countries have to make decisions under the fog of the future, multiplied by millions

04:41.540 --> 04:47.300
of people. So is that a new global pandemic on the path? It's a little hard to see. Maybe

04:47.300 --> 04:51.960
it's another annual flu, which kills just a quarter to half million people a year, or

04:51.960 --> 04:57.240
maybe it's another Spanish flu that kills 25 to 50 million. Or maybe it's that once

04:57.240 --> 05:03.640
in a millennia plague, 100 to 200 million. Those are big risks, so countries should lock

05:03.640 --> 05:08.460
down immediately, right? Well, lockdowns are used because they're better at slowing a plague

05:08.460 --> 05:14.880
than nothing, but impermeable they are not. A good lockdown is best spent to buy time

05:14.880 --> 05:19.440
to work out better treatments, which, if a country locks down early and hard enough,

05:19.440 --> 05:23.560
and a treatment comes, that lockdown might save millions from the next plague, assuming

05:23.560 --> 05:28.820
it is a plague. But a hard lockdown will damage the economy. Now, you might think the economy

05:28.820 --> 05:33.300
is the moneyed class checking their stocks on their smartphones, which it is. But it's

05:33.300 --> 05:38.660
also a measure of everything humans do that other humans value enough to pay for, which

05:38.660 --> 05:43.980
is a lot, and includes the people and companies and governments working on better treatments,

05:43.980 --> 05:49.440
and all the people and companies and governments they depend on to be able to do that job.

05:49.440 --> 05:55.380
National lockdown guarantees large economic harm immediately, and the downward curve of

05:55.380 --> 06:00.460
that harm accelerates. So a country needs to weigh that known harm against an upwardly

06:00.460 --> 06:05.760
accelerating curve of death, or potential death. Because even in this video, this way

06:05.760 --> 06:11.060
of talking about a potential pandemic and drawing it out in the fog is too clear. In

06:11.060 --> 06:16.340
reality, there's uncertain stories in a faraway place about how a dozen people might be sick

06:16.340 --> 06:21.220
from something maybe new. Based on that, if you were in charge of a country, would you

06:21.220 --> 06:26.940
press the lockdown button and cause guaranteed economic harm immediately? I don't know.

06:26.940 --> 06:31.420
And of course, there isn't a lockdown button. That's, again, just a simplified way to talk

06:31.420 --> 06:38.060
about the huge number of policy dials at hand. Which to turn up and which to turn down. Some

06:38.060 --> 06:42.660
really matter, others don't. And you don't know which is which, and underneath they're

06:42.660 --> 06:47.480
all interconnected in non-linear ways. Don't mess up. Oh, and keep in mind, you will be

06:47.480 --> 06:51.480
judged not about how good the decision was at the time, given the knowledge and trade-offs

06:51.480 --> 06:55.480
at the time, but you will be judged in the future by those looking backward, where there

06:55.480 --> 07:00.760
is no fog, and it was just so clear and obvious what to do. How could you possibly have not

07:00.760 --> 07:05.540
known that this was the next plague? Slash, there was nothing to worry about all along.

07:05.540 --> 07:09.640
Decisions under uncertainty are hard. Okay, well that was fun. Now on to some possibly

07:09.640 --> 07:13.600
tonally inappropriately chipper questions. Has lockdown affected Tumbleweed? I don't

07:13.600 --> 07:17.080
know, but I don't doubt they're taking full advantage of the situation. How much do you

07:17.080 --> 07:21.720
think the world will change because of lockdown? Long term, not a lot? It's easy when in the

07:21.720 --> 07:26.000
middle of a storm to think, wow, this is going to change everything forever. But when the

07:26.000 --> 07:30.040
weather clears, people just go back to their regular lives, and it's always, dear Princess

07:30.040 --> 07:33.940
Celestia, I didn't learn a thing. I mean, that's often the best case. What surprised

07:33.940 --> 07:38.360
me most, but really shouldn't have, is how little time it took for the pandemic to go

07:38.360 --> 07:43.560
from, this is a humanity scale problem we must solve as a global humanity, to fracturing

07:43.560 --> 07:48.240
in the usual, tiresome ways with two groups each creating a totem they can yell about

07:48.240 --> 07:53.240
how the other side is not just dumb, but maliciously evil, which is very helpful. So I guess I

07:53.240 --> 07:57.260
actually expect the next time round it will be worse because everyone living through this

07:57.260 --> 08:02.160
pandemic now will have picked their pandemic tribe when before they didn't have one. What

08:02.160 --> 08:06.480
do you miss most about going outside? Taking a walk is really useful. Stuck on a problem

08:06.480 --> 08:10.360
or feeling anxious or just need a break? A little walk is the perfect solution in a way

08:10.360 --> 08:15.220
a treadmill desk just can't replicate. Even with a VR helmet. I've tried. How do you feel

08:15.220 --> 08:18.940
about the state of VR? I bought my first set at the start of this lockdown and it was one

08:18.940 --> 08:24.440
of the best decisions I've ever made. VR Done Well is truly a new medium to add to the list

08:24.440 --> 08:29.320
of film and books and even traditional gaming. It's just such a distinct experience, and

08:29.320 --> 08:34.560
especially when inside for weeks or months on end, it's pretty good at tricking your

08:34.560 --> 08:38.880
brain into thinking you've gone somewhere else. The technology was overhyped for two

08:38.880 --> 08:43.840
decades, but this is the start of something real and virtual reality, along with augmented

08:43.840 --> 08:49.100
reality, is something I am pumped to see improve over the next two decades. What's the fifth

08:49.100 --> 08:53.520
most important station on Spaceship U? The coffee station, obviously. What about lockdown

08:53.520 --> 08:58.900
do you enjoy the most? It's an amazing feeling of freedom to have a completely empty calendar.

08:58.900 --> 09:03.640
It makes me think of the end of the school year, both as a student and teacher. So excited

09:03.640 --> 09:08.120
to leave the pseudo prison and all its pointless busy work and obligations. The structure of

09:08.120 --> 09:13.200
the human-imposed world fading away, leaving me alone to be alone. But summer can only

09:13.200 --> 09:18.180
be a season long. Eventually, school and its torturous tedium would return. And so it goes

09:18.180 --> 09:23.720
with pandemic season. The human-imposed world will return, but the interregnum is nice.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.420
How will lockdown affect education in the future? Well, I think primary and secondary

09:27.420 --> 09:32.200
school at least will be pretty unaffected, as we all jointly agree to pretend their primary

09:32.200 --> 09:37.000
purpose is education, not babysitification. But I think this quarantine has made plain

09:37.000 --> 09:42.400
some of the necessary lies of civilization around education, particularly higher education.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.920
But I leave what those are as an exercise for the viewer, for now. Your Spaceship U

09:46.920 --> 09:50.440
video made it seem like you have it all sorted in these strange times. How sorted would you

09:50.440 --> 09:54.800
say you feel? Have you broken any of your rules? Well, I feel pretty sorted, but I've

09:54.800 --> 09:59.320
been preparing for this my whole life, so I'm in a fortunate situation. However, part

09:59.320 --> 10:03.680
of the reason I made the Spaceship U video is because I was thinking of my younger self.

10:03.680 --> 10:09.360
When I first moved to London, I had college loans, no income, no job prospects, no social

10:09.360 --> 10:14.620
contacts, no real plans, just a room and shared accommodations. Those first few months in

10:14.620 --> 10:20.940
London were hard, and had a global lockdown occurred then, it would have been a dark situation.

10:20.940 --> 10:24.960
So that video was a bit of a message in a bottle for my younger self of, hey, here's

10:24.960 --> 10:29.080
a bunch of stuff that will work for you. Do this and save yourself years of figuring it

10:29.080 --> 10:33.800
out. Because, spoiler, Spaceship U isn't just a way to think about lockdown, it's

10:33.800 --> 10:38.560
a way to think about your whole life. Now, obviously, my past self doesn't exist because

10:38.560 --> 10:42.720
the past doesn't exist, so I can't send him a message. But human personality matrices

10:42.720 --> 10:47.760
are limited in possibility, so there are guaranteed to be lots of similar people who would be

10:47.760 --> 10:52.200
similarly receptive. As for the second part, the rules get broken, but I don't call them

10:52.200 --> 10:57.220
rules in the video on purpose. They're targets. And the thing about a target is, no matter

10:57.220 --> 11:02.620
how good you are, no one hits the bullseye every time. A target is about taking aim.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.660
Have you actually placed colorful tape around the house to mark your zones? No, but I did

11:06.660 --> 11:11.900
buy paint to make my office dark blue, the color I most associate with important work.

11:11.900 --> 11:16.000
It's the best way for me to make this part of my apartment feel as different from the

11:16.000 --> 11:20.540
rest as possible. What's the best board game for family quarantine time? Oh, why Settlers

11:20.540 --> 11:24.580
of Catan, of course. If you haven't tried it, you really should. If you were a virus,

11:24.580 --> 11:29.580
what would your goal be? To become irreplaceably symbiotic. Hitching a ride on the future of

11:29.580 --> 11:34.420
humanity is a better path to long-term survival than killing your host. Viruses don't make

11:34.420 --> 11:39.020
plans, they just are, but they do tend to become less fatal over time for this very

11:39.020 --> 11:44.660
reason. Has the lockdown affected your schedule? Oh yes, has it. I've made a calendaring discovery

11:44.660 --> 11:49.660
so great, so monumental, I've pulled it out of this Q&A because I want to propagandize

11:49.660 --> 11:54.900
it as far and wide as possible. What home-based exercises have given you the most benefit?

11:54.900 --> 11:58.800
Without a doubt, weights. It's simple and has the best return on investment. I don't

11:58.800 --> 12:04.020
like exercise, I never have, but a little set of weights have a lot going for them.

12:04.020 --> 12:09.000
You can start way easy and make spreadsheetable progress quickly. Get yourself some dumbbells

12:09.000 --> 12:14.140
and a pull-up bar and you have maybe 65% the benefits of a gym without having to leave

12:14.140 --> 12:18.620
home. Are handshakes gone for good? I hope so, but doubt it. I can only say they're gone

12:18.620 --> 12:24.380
for good for me. Has lockdown impacted your projects? Oh yes. So last year I started working

12:24.380 --> 12:29.860
on videos for a playlist called Grey Goes Outside and I had a really big Summer of Grey

12:29.860 --> 12:34.940
planned for some videos that were going to go on there and trips related to current projects

12:34.940 --> 12:42.420
and new places to visit and try to show people. But then, yeah, global pandemic. My lockdown

12:42.420 --> 12:46.660
question for everyone has been, when do you think you will next get on an airplane? I'm

12:46.660 --> 12:51.240
curious for everyone's answers because I don't know what the answer is for myself.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.500
How long will it be before I can visit an interesting place? I just don't know. The

12:55.500 --> 13:00.860
fog of the future at this moment in time is just too dense. But I'll put that playlist

13:00.860 --> 13:06.820
up on the screen now if you too are in lockdown and need a bit of vicarious outside viewing.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.660
See you next time, internet. Stay safe.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.660
You
