00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
Hello internet!

00:01.640 --> 00:05.480
Recently YouTube invited me to California for a conference with a bunch of really interesting

00:05.480 --> 00:06.480
people.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.400
There were many talks and giant balloons and much discussion of what the future of education

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
might look like.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.320
Which is no small issue because how society raises the next generation of scientists,

00:15.320 --> 00:18.360
doctors and programmers shapes the future of human civilization.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.520
It was an amazing few days and if you'll tolerate my ramblings, I'd like to share some of my

00:22.520 --> 00:26.920
thoughts on this as someone who's worked as an educator both in and out of schools.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.320
This is how schools have pretty much always looked, a guy in the front who knows all the

00:30.320 --> 00:33.200
things and students who don't so the guy tells them.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.600
But a teacher explains things at the right pace for maybe one student in the room during

00:37.600 --> 00:38.600
a lesson.

00:38.600 --> 00:42.680
Everyone else is either bored because they already understand the material or lost because

00:42.680 --> 00:45.240
they're missing knowledge they should already have.

00:45.240 --> 00:49.360
But at the end of the lesson, regardless of student understanding, the curriculum marches

00:49.360 --> 00:50.960
relentlessly on.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.880
And whether the teacher uses a blackboard, whiteboard or smartboard and whether the students

00:54.880 --> 00:59.840
use tablets, paper or tablets again, this system isn't really any different.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.780
It's just technology doing the same thing in a shinier way.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.900
But the internet is different and behind the scenes something interesting is happening

01:07.900 --> 01:10.360
that hints at the shape of things to come.

01:10.360 --> 01:15.480
In a perfect school, each student would have a personal tutor, like Aristotle to Alexander

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
the Great.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.760
But if your education policy is Aristotle for everyone, then there are three big problems

01:20.760 --> 01:21.760
with this.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.580
First there aren't enough humans on Earth to individually tutor every child and even

01:25.580 --> 01:28.340
if there were it would be horrifically expensive.

01:28.340 --> 01:32.880
And even if neither manpower nor money was a problem, not everyone is as good a tutor

01:32.880 --> 01:34.180
as Aristotle.

01:34.180 --> 01:38.220
But technology is solving these problems starting with number one.

01:38.220 --> 01:41.940
For who needs humans when the internet can teach you all the things.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.060
Want to learn calculus?

01:43.060 --> 01:44.060
Get started.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.180
Need an AP Biology course?

01:45.180 --> 01:49.120
Go watch this one along with hundreds of thousands of other students.

01:49.120 --> 01:54.300
The internet massively multiplies the audience of potential teachers and solves the manpower

01:54.300 --> 01:55.300
problem.

01:55.300 --> 01:58.260
But isn't cheerleading the internet the same thing I was complaining about before?

01:58.260 --> 02:01.300
New tech doing old things just with more shiny?

02:01.300 --> 02:05.020
After all, if you were a pre-internet child with bookish inclinations, there's always

02:05.020 --> 02:07.320
been a place to teach you all the things.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.900
And people thought that radio and TV were going to revolutionize education by giving

02:10.900 --> 02:14.600
teachers huge audiences, but here we still are.

02:14.600 --> 02:19.020
These are good points, but the internet also solves the cost problem in a way that radio

02:19.020 --> 02:21.040
and TV never could.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.700
Real shows are expensive to make and even the best of educational TV often gets pushed

02:25.700 --> 02:31.120
aside for dumber, more popular stuff that, not coincidentally, is also more profitable.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.940
This is known as the History Channel Effect.

02:33.940 --> 02:38.580
But the cost to access the internet is only going down, as is the cost to make stuff for

02:38.580 --> 02:39.580
the internet.

02:39.580 --> 02:44.020
Which is why a guy with some paper and a marker in his bedroom can pull in a million views

02:44.440 --> 02:48.840
a month at essentially zero cost and doesn't have to worry about competition from stuff

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
like this.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.040
So the internet solves problems 1 and 2, but educational videos still aren't personalized

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
to students.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.400
And that leaves YouTube as a library of video, not a tutor like Aristotle.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.600
But you can build on top of YouTube, and what I see coming is this.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.640
Digital Aristotle for everyone.

03:05.640 --> 03:11.180
A computer program that tutors students individually by pulling from a library of videos like YouTube,

03:11.180 --> 03:15.240
a program that tests students on what they know and, more importantly, adapt to the

03:15.240 --> 03:19.360
way they learn over time by comparing the effectiveness of different videos and different

03:19.360 --> 03:23.960
tests to discover, scientifically, what works best.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.280
This isn't a fantasy.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.420
There are people building parts of this right now, even if Digital Aristotle isn't their

03:29.420 --> 03:30.680
explicit goal.

03:30.680 --> 03:36.200
And one of these places is the Khan Academy, which is more than just Saul's soothing voice.

03:36.200 --> 03:41.300
If this does not blow your mind, you have no emotion.

03:41.300 --> 03:46.180
Behind the website is incredibly complicated software testing everything about student

03:46.180 --> 03:47.180
learning.

03:47.180 --> 03:51.340
The effectiveness of different videos, different tests, and different ways of asking questions.

03:51.340 --> 03:55.580
And while it may seem primitive now, technology only gets better faster.

03:55.580 --> 03:59.740
When Digital Aristotle arrives, it will be cheaper, less labor-intensive, and better

03:59.740 --> 04:02.500
than human teachers ever could be.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.640
I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle or something like it will free teachers to

04:06.640 --> 04:10.480
float around the classroom helping kids work on interesting projects.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.200
And while that might happen in the near term, I don't think that's the long-term reality.

04:15.200 --> 04:19.960
For what happens when Digital Aristotle truly knows students better than the teacher?

04:19.960 --> 04:25.360
When for every topic of human endeavor, it's able to take the best and brightest kids further

04:25.360 --> 04:29.120
down the path of knowledge than their teachers ever could.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.000
I doubt that schools will go away.

04:31.260 --> 04:35.340
After all, they aren't just about learning, but also freeing parents to work in the economy

04:35.340 --> 04:38.740
while their feral children are turned into civilized adults.

04:38.740 --> 04:43.100
But schools will be radically different, and there will be far fewer teachers working in

04:43.100 --> 04:45.260
them doing far less.

04:45.260 --> 04:50.340
And while that's not great news for teachers, it's awesome news for students and society.

04:50.340 --> 04:54.140
Right now, if you're a student doing poorly, school moves on without you.

04:54.140 --> 04:57.380
And if you're doing well, school holds you back.

04:57.380 --> 05:02.020
In the future, I see every human using Digital Aristotle for their whole life.

05:02.020 --> 05:05.900
A tutor personalized to them, teaching them exactly what they need to learn when they're

05:05.900 --> 05:07.800
best ready for it.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.960
And when that comes, we'll have both a better educational system and a better society.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.280
I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people who ran it for bringing me out to California

05:19.280 --> 05:21.580
to meet up with these awesome people.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.040
I had more interesting conversations over the space of a few days than I normally get

05:25.040 --> 05:27.500
to have over the space of a few months.

05:27.500 --> 05:31.540
If you want to see what the best of education looks like right now, go check out their channels.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.560
And if you want to hear more on this topic, I've put together a playlist of talks that

05:34.560 --> 05:35.140
I hope you like.
