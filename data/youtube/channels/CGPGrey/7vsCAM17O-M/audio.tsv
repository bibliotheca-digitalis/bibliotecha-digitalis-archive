0	1640	Hello internet!
1640	5480	Recently YouTube invited me to California for a conference with a bunch of really interesting
5480	6480	people.
6480	10400	There were many talks and giant balloons and much discussion of what the future of education
10400	11400	might look like.
11400	15320	Which is no small issue because how society raises the next generation of scientists,
15320	18360	doctors and programmers shapes the future of human civilization.
18360	22520	It was an amazing few days and if you'll tolerate my ramblings, I'd like to share some of my
22520	26920	thoughts on this as someone who's worked as an educator both in and out of schools.
26920	30320	This is how schools have pretty much always looked, a guy in the front who knows all the
30320	33200	things and students who don't so the guy tells them.
33200	37600	But a teacher explains things at the right pace for maybe one student in the room during
37600	38600	a lesson.
38600	42680	Everyone else is either bored because they already understand the material or lost because
42680	45240	they're missing knowledge they should already have.
45240	49360	But at the end of the lesson, regardless of student understanding, the curriculum marches
49360	50960	relentlessly on.
50960	54880	And whether the teacher uses a blackboard, whiteboard or smartboard and whether the students
54880	59840	use tablets, paper or tablets again, this system isn't really any different.
59840	63780	It's just technology doing the same thing in a shinier way.
63780	67900	But the internet is different and behind the scenes something interesting is happening
67900	70360	that hints at the shape of things to come.
70360	75480	In a perfect school, each student would have a personal tutor, like Aristotle to Alexander
75480	76480	the Great.
76480	80760	But if your education policy is Aristotle for everyone, then there are three big problems
80760	81760	with this.
81760	85580	First there aren't enough humans on Earth to individually tutor every child and even
85580	88340	if there were it would be horrifically expensive.
88340	92880	And even if neither manpower nor money was a problem, not everyone is as good a tutor
92880	94180	as Aristotle.
94180	98220	But technology is solving these problems starting with number one.
98220	101940	For who needs humans when the internet can teach you all the things.
101940	103060	Want to learn calculus?
103060	104060	Get started.
104060	105180	Need an AP Biology course?
105180	109120	Go watch this one along with hundreds of thousands of other students.
109120	114300	The internet massively multiplies the audience of potential teachers and solves the manpower
114300	115300	problem.
115300	118260	But isn't cheerleading the internet the same thing I was complaining about before?
118260	121300	New tech doing old things just with more shiny?
121300	125020	After all, if you were a pre-internet child with bookish inclinations, there's always
125020	127320	been a place to teach you all the things.
127320	130900	And people thought that radio and TV were going to revolutionize education by giving
130900	134600	teachers huge audiences, but here we still are.
134600	139020	These are good points, but the internet also solves the cost problem in a way that radio
139020	141040	and TV never could.
141040	145700	Real shows are expensive to make and even the best of educational TV often gets pushed
145700	151120	aside for dumber, more popular stuff that, not coincidentally, is also more profitable.
151120	153940	This is known as the History Channel Effect.
153940	158580	But the cost to access the internet is only going down, as is the cost to make stuff for
158580	159580	the internet.
159580	164020	Which is why a guy with some paper and a marker in his bedroom can pull in a million views
164440	168840	a month at essentially zero cost and doesn't have to worry about competition from stuff
168840	169840	like this.
169840	174040	So the internet solves problems 1 and 2, but educational videos still aren't personalized
174040	175040	to students.
175040	179400	And that leaves YouTube as a library of video, not a tutor like Aristotle.
179400	183600	But you can build on top of YouTube, and what I see coming is this.
183600	185640	Digital Aristotle for everyone.
185640	191180	A computer program that tutors students individually by pulling from a library of videos like YouTube,
191180	195240	a program that tests students on what they know and, more importantly, adapt to the
195240	199360	way they learn over time by comparing the effectiveness of different videos and different
199360	203960	tests to discover, scientifically, what works best.
203960	205280	This isn't a fantasy.
205280	209420	There are people building parts of this right now, even if Digital Aristotle isn't their
209420	210680	explicit goal.
210680	216200	And one of these places is the Khan Academy, which is more than just Saul's soothing voice.
216200	221300	If this does not blow your mind, you have no emotion.
221300	226180	Behind the website is incredibly complicated software testing everything about student
226180	227180	learning.
227180	231340	The effectiveness of different videos, different tests, and different ways of asking questions.
231340	235580	And while it may seem primitive now, technology only gets better faster.
235580	239740	When Digital Aristotle arrives, it will be cheaper, less labor-intensive, and better
239740	242500	than human teachers ever could be.
242500	246640	I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle or something like it will free teachers to
246640	250480	float around the classroom helping kids work on interesting projects.
250480	255200	And while that might happen in the near term, I don't think that's the long-term reality.
255200	259960	For what happens when Digital Aristotle truly knows students better than the teacher?
259960	265360	When for every topic of human endeavor, it's able to take the best and brightest kids further
265360	269120	down the path of knowledge than their teachers ever could.
269120	271000	I doubt that schools will go away.
271260	275340	After all, they aren't just about learning, but also freeing parents to work in the economy
275340	278740	while their feral children are turned into civilized adults.
278740	283100	But schools will be radically different, and there will be far fewer teachers working in
283100	285260	them doing far less.
285260	290340	And while that's not great news for teachers, it's awesome news for students and society.
290340	294140	Right now, if you're a student doing poorly, school moves on without you.
294140	297380	And if you're doing well, school holds you back.
297380	302020	In the future, I see every human using Digital Aristotle for their whole life.
302020	305900	A tutor personalized to them, teaching them exactly what they need to learn when they're
305900	307800	best ready for it.
307800	311960	And when that comes, we'll have both a better educational system and a better society.
315720	319280	I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people who ran it for bringing me out to California
319280	321580	to meet up with these awesome people.
321580	325040	I had more interesting conversations over the space of a few days than I normally get
325040	327500	to have over the space of a few months.
327500	331540	If you want to see what the best of education looks like right now, go check out their channels.
331540	334560	And if you want to hear more on this topic, I've put together a playlist of talks that
334560	335140	I hope you like.
