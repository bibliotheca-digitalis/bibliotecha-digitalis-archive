00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Hello internet!

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,480
Recently YouTube invited me to California for a conference with a bunch of really interesting

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
people.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
There were many talks and giant balloons and much discussion of what the future of education

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
might look like.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,320
Which is no small issue because how society raises the next generation of scientists,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,360
doctors and programmers shapes the future of human civilization.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,520
It was an amazing few days and if you'll tolerate my ramblings, I'd like to share some of my

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,920
thoughts on this as someone who's worked as an educator both in and out of schools.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,320
This is how schools have pretty much always looked, a guy in the front who knows all the

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
things and students who don't so the guy tells them.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
But a teacher explains things at the right pace for maybe one student in the room during

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
a lesson.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,680
Everyone else is either bored because they already understand the material or lost because

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,240
they're missing knowledge they should already have.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,360
But at the end of the lesson, regardless of student understanding, the curriculum marches

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
relentlessly on.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,880
And whether the teacher uses a blackboard, whiteboard or smartboard and whether the students

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,840
use tablets, paper or tablets again, this system isn't really any different.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,780
It's just technology doing the same thing in a shinier way.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,900
But the internet is different and behind the scenes something interesting is happening

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,360
that hints at the shape of things to come.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,480
In a perfect school, each student would have a personal tutor, like Aristotle to Alexander

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
the Great.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,760
But if your education policy is Aristotle for everyone, then there are three big problems

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
with this.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,580
First there aren't enough humans on Earth to individually tutor every child and even

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,340
if there were it would be horrifically expensive.

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,880
And even if neither manpower nor money was a problem, not everyone is as good a tutor

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,180
as Aristotle.

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,220
But technology is solving these problems starting with number one.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,940
For who needs humans when the internet can teach you all the things.

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,060
Want to learn calculus?

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Get started.

35
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,180
Need an AP Biology course?

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,120
Go watch this one along with hundreds of thousands of other students.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,300
The internet massively multiplies the audience of potential teachers and solves the manpower

38
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
problem.

39
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,260
But isn't cheerleading the internet the same thing I was complaining about before?

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,300
New tech doing old things just with more shiny?

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,020
After all, if you were a pre-internet child with bookish inclinations, there's always

42
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,320
been a place to teach you all the things.

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,900
And people thought that radio and TV were going to revolutionize education by giving

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,600
teachers huge audiences, but here we still are.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,020
These are good points, but the internet also solves the cost problem in a way that radio

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,040
and TV never could.

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,700
Real shows are expensive to make and even the best of educational TV often gets pushed

48
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,120
aside for dumber, more popular stuff that, not coincidentally, is also more profitable.

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,940
This is known as the History Channel Effect.

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,580
But the cost to access the internet is only going down, as is the cost to make stuff for

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
the internet.

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,020
Which is why a guy with some paper and a marker in his bedroom can pull in a million views

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,840
a month at essentially zero cost and doesn't have to worry about competition from stuff

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
like this.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,040
So the internet solves problems 1 and 2, but educational videos still aren't personalized

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
to students.

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,400
And that leaves YouTube as a library of video, not a tutor like Aristotle.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,600
But you can build on top of YouTube, and what I see coming is this.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,640
Digital Aristotle for everyone.

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,180
A computer program that tutors students individually by pulling from a library of videos like YouTube,

61
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,240
a program that tests students on what they know and, more importantly, adapt to the

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,360
way they learn over time by comparing the effectiveness of different videos and different

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,960
tests to discover, scientifically, what works best.

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
This isn't a fantasy.

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,420
There are people building parts of this right now, even if Digital Aristotle isn't their

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,680
explicit goal.

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,200
And one of these places is the Khan Academy, which is more than just Saul's soothing voice.

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,300
If this does not blow your mind, you have no emotion.

69
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,180
Behind the website is incredibly complicated software testing everything about student

70
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
learning.

71
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,340
The effectiveness of different videos, different tests, and different ways of asking questions.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,580
And while it may seem primitive now, technology only gets better faster.

73
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,740
When Digital Aristotle arrives, it will be cheaper, less labor-intensive, and better

74
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,500
than human teachers ever could be.

75
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,640
I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle or something like it will free teachers to

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
float around the classroom helping kids work on interesting projects.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,200
And while that might happen in the near term, I don't think that's the long-term reality.

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,960
For what happens when Digital Aristotle truly knows students better than the teacher?

79
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,360
When for every topic of human endeavor, it's able to take the best and brightest kids further

80
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
down the path of knowledge than their teachers ever could.

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
I doubt that schools will go away.

82
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,340
After all, they aren't just about learning, but also freeing parents to work in the economy

83
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,740
while their feral children are turned into civilized adults.

84
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,100
But schools will be radically different, and there will be far fewer teachers working in

85
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,260
them doing far less.

86
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,340
And while that's not great news for teachers, it's awesome news for students and society.

87
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,140
Right now, if you're a student doing poorly, school moves on without you.

88
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,380
And if you're doing well, school holds you back.

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,020
In the future, I see every human using Digital Aristotle for their whole life.

90
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,900
A tutor personalized to them, teaching them exactly what they need to learn when they're

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,800
best ready for it.

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,960
And when that comes, we'll have both a better educational system and a better society.

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,280
I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people who ran it for bringing me out to California

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,580
to meet up with these awesome people.

95
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,040
I had more interesting conversations over the space of a few days than I normally get

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,500
to have over the space of a few months.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,540
If you want to see what the best of education looks like right now, go check out their channels.

98
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,560
And if you want to hear more on this topic, I've put together a playlist of talks that

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,140
I hope you like.
