0	3800	While waiting on a plane during taxi till take-off, looking out the window,
3800	6880	you may have noticed the giant number numbering the runway,
6880	10560	say 8, which implies 7 others exist, at least,
10560	14960	but this is a flight out of LOL airport, in Nevada's desert of nothing.
14960	17920	There's only two runways, which, given the passenger load,
17920	20400	seems like maybe one too many already.
20400	23280	What's the deal with runway numbers, you might wonder aloud?
23280	25840	Oh, hello again! Flying to Nook as well, are you?
25840	31040	It is a long flight, so there's tons of time for me to tell you all about runways.
31040	31920	Let's begin.
31920	36000	So, before you can number a runway at an airport, you need to build the airport.
36000	39280	And before you can build the airport, you need to plan the port.
39280	42960	And what needs figuring first is which way to run the way.
42960	46880	Pilots want runways with winds in parallel for physics reasons that we are going to skip,
46880	49680	both because lift physics is something people really like to argue about,
49680	51040	and this isn't a physics video.
51040	53360	Yeah, I'm recording a runway video right now, hope you don't mind.
53360	56640	But the summary is, planes take off and land into the wind,
56640	58800	because it lets them use less runway,
58800	61920	and makes for safer and stabler landings in particular.
61920	64960	Now, planes can land with winds unaligned,
64960	68160	but it's unsettling to watch these crosswind attempts,
68160	70960	as pilots do their best to face into the wind,
70960	73760	while landing on a runway that does not.
74480	75200	Oof.
75200	78160	So, airports too want winds running with the runway,
78160	80800	but the universe is indifferent to human desires.
80800	82160	Wind winds as it wants,
82160	86800	so the simple solution in aviation early days was to build a triangle of runways,
86800	88000	put up a little wind sock,
88000	92400	and direct the pilot to the runway that paralleled the sock, and thus the wind.
92400	96320	But as aviation grew, so did airplanes, and thus their runways,
96320	100320	making the triangle trick impractical for big urban internationals.
100320	102080	But the simple sock still solved it.
102080	104880	See, if you record when and which way the wind sock blows,
104880	107680	and with what wind force, you've grown yourself a wind rose,
107680	110640	a clever little data viz tool with the sock in the center
110640	112480	of compass points for orientation,
112480	115840	and bars colored in size for strength and frequency of wind.
115840	119840	Though it reads opposite, actually, of everyone's expectations,
119840	124320	with the lines showing the way the wind blows from and not to.
124320	126640	Physics stuff just loves to opposite, actually.
126640	129040	Let's just agree to avoid physics for this video, shall we?
129040	132480	Wind roses reverse readings aside, they reveal that in most places,
132480	136560	most of the time, most of the wind mostly blows back and forth in one direction.
136560	138640	So that's surprisingly convenient.
138640	140080	Thanks, indifferent universe!
140080	141520	Oh, you did it for other reasons?
141520	145360	Well, still, this convenient wind happens because wind is a current of air,
145360	148160	transporting heat from where there's more to where there's less.
148160	151440	The Earth is blasted by the nuclear heat of the Sun,
151440	153520	with the equator getting hit hot hardest,
153520	157200	making hot air rise there as it cools out along the edge of space
157200	161200	before coming back down, creating a big-scale convection current
161200	163600	that repeats in a pattern all up and down.
163600	165600	And because the Earth is a sphere that spins,
165600	168480	those cylindric convection currents of air on the surface
168480	171600	twist clockwise north of the equator and counter below.
171600	175440	This is the Coriolis effect, creating coiled currents of air everywhere,
175440	179120	which is cool, but also physics trying to sneak back into the video,
179120	180400	and this isn't a physics video.
180400	184000	All that matters is this creates the pretty stable pattern of trade winds,
184000	186560	and if you're planning a port, you need only know
186560	189120	which way does the wind mostly blow.
189120	193120	Though, at some locations, the wind rose reveals two frequent directions of wind,
193120	196720	so if you want to constantly and safestly keep open the airport,
196720	199120	you're going to need to run a second way.
199120	202800	This is why many airports have an X or V layout like LOL.
202800	206000	They're not necessarily doing double the traffic of a one-runway port,
206000	208320	but rather have double the chance of crosswinds
208320	210400	when the tower will need to reroute pilots
210400	213040	toward the other alignment for safer landings.
213040	216880	And once you have two of something, you need names or numbers.
216880	219520	Sure, you could just go with run one and run two,
219520	223040	but pro tip, try never to use the very first thing that comes to mind
223040	224960	without giving it a bit of a ponder first,
224960	228160	and the wind rose reveals a better way with the compass points,
228160	231040	which form a circle of 360 degrees,
231040	235040	starting at zero north, east 90, south 180, west 270,
235040	237280	and back to north makes it 360 as well.
237280	239680	These compass degrees come from ships of the seas,
239680	243600	because captains and quartermasters, when in the vast featureless nothing,
243600	246720	could still count on their compass to point toward the north pole,
246720	248640	assuming no iron hooks happen nearby,
248640	251120	and with north as a fixed navigational point,
251120	253840	could then communicate their heading with names broadly,
253840	257200	east-southeast, or numbers precisely, helm to 108.
257200	257920	Quite handy!
257920	262320	So it's no surprise these compass headings got passed from sea ships to airships.
262320	265200	Thus, on the wind rose devised plans for any airport,
265200	270160	the runway is already aligned with navigational numbers begging to be used.
270160	274160	But before grabbing the obvious one, again, ponder for a moment.
274160	278160	The runway points from the perspective of the port toward the plane.
278160	280640	The rather more important heading to use
280640	283440	is from the plane's perspective approaching the port,
283440	286880	which on the plan is at the opposite end, actually,
286880	291120	because it's what number matches the compass in the cockpit that's critical.
291120	292880	Alright, this needs a couple of example airports.
292880	294880	Take one with a north-south runway.
294880	297360	When the wind blows from the north to the south,
297360	300640	the tower directs pilots to approach from the south,
300640	302560	meaning they need to point the plane north,
302560	305920	which on their compass is a heading of 360 degrees.
305920	308560	So let's put a big 360 on that end for now.
308560	312400	When the winds reverse, the tower directs pilots to approach from the north
312400	314640	to fly south, which reads 180.
314640	317040	So let's put a big 180 on that end as well.
317040	318400	Now that we've got our heading numbers,
318400	322640	the convention is to round them to 10 and cut off the zero for the runway number,
322640	325120	because we don't need three sig figs of precision
325120	328240	when airports have single digit numbers of runways,
328240	331840	and the very stressed air traffic controllers in the tower
331840	335600	need to repeat precisely these numbers hundreds of times a day.
335600	338000	So saving syllables here really matters.
338000	340880	Thus, when the tower tells the plane to use runway 36,
340880	345120	the pilot knows they need to get south of the airport to land facing north,
345120	348560	and while there are like a million indicators in a cockpit,
348560	351040	the pilot can always confirm they're doing it right
351040	354560	by reading 360 on their ancient ancestor's compass.
354560	357040	This low-tech check is useful as a fallback
357040	361600	because a compass can see the way even when eyes and other equipment cannot.
361600	362960	As a two-runway example,
362960	366080	an airport with a perfect ordinal X would get numbered thusly.
366080	369040	Northwest to southeast gives 315 for one end,
369040	370800	because that's the way the pilot needs to point,
370800	372480	and 135 at the other.
372480	374800	Round to 10 for 320 and 140,
374800	378160	then drop the zeros to get runways 32 and 14.
378160	380560	On the other side, 225 and 45,
380560	383920	round to 10 again, drop the zeros for 23 and 5.
383920	385520	Now, when the towers talk to the pilots,
385520	388880	they say each digit individually, so runway 23,
388880	390720	because clarity here is critical,
390720	396080	which is also why the font and exact size of these digits is standardized worldwide.
396080	399760	Though there are disagreements between the abundant aviation agencies
399760	404160	as to if single-digit runways like 6 should have a leading zero for clarity,
404160	406800	or if that leading zero should only be in our hearts.
406800	407920	Which it shouldn't be.
407920	411520	Anyway, that's the surprisingly good system behind numbering these numbers,
411520	413440	which is always a delight to discover,
413440	415920	unlike some other numbers I could mention.
415920	418160	Though there are a couple of wrinkles.
418160	419040	For, think about it,
419040	422080	if the wind mostly blows back and forth in most places,
422080	427120	then most big busy urban international airports will need multiple runways in parallel.
427120	429840	But parallel runways have the same heading,
429840	431920	thus the same number under this system,
431920	435280	which would be unclear for pilots to say the least.
435280	437440	So all the agencies assembled to agree.
437440	439360	If you have two parallel runways,
439360	440720	they will have the same number,
440720	443760	but add an L or an R for left and right.
443760	445840	If you need to construct a third runway,
445840	447600	add a C for center too.
447600	448640	But with four more,
448640	451760	two runways will get the correct heading number with L and R,
451840	453200	but the others,
453200	456800	they're going to get the next closest numbers,
456800	459520	but not exactly correct numbers.
459520	462240	Which is practical, I suppose.
462240	463360	But also,
463360	466480	ahh, it's all slightly misaligned.
466480	467760	It's big airports.
467760	469680	Like, it doesn't line up.
469680	471360	Like, just try not to think about it, okay?
471360	472320	Just try not to think about it.
472960	474720	Oh, we're landing at Nook already?
474720	477280	Wow, flights fly fast when you're flapping about flying.
477280	478960	Time to put this knowledge to use.
478960	481200	Our compass heading reads 42 degrees,
481200	482960	so round 210, 440,
482960	486240	cut the zero and we'll be landing on runway zero four.
486240	488240	And since there's only one runway at Nook,
488240	490080	it'll be perfectly aligned.
490080	491520	No doubt about that.
492160	494960	Oh, it's five, not four.
495520	497040	How embarrassing.
497040	498960	I guess I need to delete this video now.
499760	501920	Hey, why are you painting a new runway number?
501920	503600	You do that every few decades?
503600	504400	That must mean...
505040	507040	ohhh.
507040	510080	Runway numbers depend on where the north pole is,
510080	511520	and so watch out!
511520	515120	There's a geography video inside this video called
515120	517200	Where is the North Pole Really?
517200	518400	Okay, to find the north pole,
518400	520560	remember that the Earth is a sphere that spins.
520560	522000	Oh, sorry, we already went over that.
522000	524320	We draw a line about which this spin occurs
524320	526640	and name each end the north and south pole.
526640	527600	Starting with these poles,
527600	531680	we clever humans created a square-ish coordinate system for our spherical Earth,
531680	533360	the detailed creation of which I'm going to skip
533360	535520	because that's a physics story for a never time
535520	538400	that took hundreds of years and needed lots of clocks.
538400	540400	And to make it official that London rules and Paris drools.
540400	543920	But anyway, this grid is what every modern navigational system uses
543920	548160	to get around with the GPS, Global Positioning, coordinates it gives.
548160	551760	But if you were to use your GPS to direct you to the north pole
551760	555120	so that you could experience the planet rotating you in place,
555120	559840	as the stars circled overhead and you pondered the scale of the indifferent universe
559840	562960	and your tiny, tiny existence within it,
562960	567360	if you took out your compass to double check that the GPS got the spot right,
567360	571760	the compass points you over the horizon toward another north pole.
571760	573040	What gives compass?
573040	574400	Well, what did you expect?
574400	578000	A compass is a magnet and magnets follow magnetic fields.
578000	579840	That's like their only thing?
579840	581200	It's not a math magnet.
581200	585120	Your magnet compass will take you to the gigantic magnetic field
585120	587120	spewing forth from inside the Earth.
587120	590800	So there are two north poles, one for math and one for magnets.
590800	593200	I mean, I guess if you want to be technical about it,
593200	595840	there are three north poles because the magnetic field,
595840	600880	the north pole of a magnet points to is the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field
600880	602240	because opposites attract.
602240	605120	But look, we're just going to ignore that because this isn't a physics video
605120	608000	and there's been enough, oh, it's the opposite actually already.
608000	611040	And yes, I know you can define more norths, but we're moving on.
611040	612720	There are two norths, math and magnets.
612720	616400	The compass points to the magnetic north and the GPS points to the geographic north.
616400	618000	They don't have anything to do with each other,
618000	619840	but for navigation, humans have used both.
619840	623280	One isn't better than the other, though math slash geographic north
623280	624960	is now often called true north,
624960	628160	which feels a bit like humans picking the new one as their favorite one.
628160	631760	Oh, and ships of the seas have stopped using the old magnetic north
631760	635120	and now navigate with GPS using the true north, even modern pirates,
635120	638320	but planes and pilots still love the traditional magnet north.
638320	641600	And we can stop thinking about this because they're pretty close anyway.
641600	644800	Although, isn't that kind of weird,
644800	648960	just how close the unrelated poles are on a planetary scale?
648960	652400	Earth just so happens to have a giant magnet that's sort of,
652400	655520	but not quite lines up with the planet's top and bottom.
655520	658720	In different universes, are these things secretly related?
658720	660960	And still, why would runway numbers change
660960	664320	just because they're pointing at the magnet one, but not the math one?
664320	669600	Oh no, there really is an unavoidable physics video inside this geography video,
669600	670480	and it's called
670480	672320	Magnets. What's your deal?
672320	677280	Okay, we really can't cover everything about magnets because it's just so much,
677280	681840	but some bits of some metal, such as iron, generate around them a magnetic field.
681840	684640	Why and how were a mystery for a long time,
684640	686400	until we discovered that if you take a wire
686400	689200	and run a current of electrons through it, aka electricity,
689200	692640	this current also generates a magnetic field around the wire.
692640	695680	But weirder, if you start with a current of electrons
695680	698800	and pop them in a magnetic field, the current will curve.
698800	701440	And oh look, you've stumbled upon a clue
701440	704000	to one of the fundamental secrets of the universe.
704000	709040	Magnets and electricity are two expressions of the same thing, electromagnetism.
709040	711520	That's why in science class, you can coil up a wire,
711520	715360	send a current of electricity through it, and the whole thing becomes a magnet.
715360	718560	One you can make stronger and stronger with each additional coil,
718560	721040	cause curving currents are magnets.
721040	723920	Which is why when you cut the current, everything drops.
723920	726400	Our just iron magnets are doing the same thing,
726400	730240	but you need to zoom down and down and down and down
730240	732080	to the atomic level to see.
732080	734880	Here, an atom of iron has a cloud of electrons,
734880	738880	each electron with a charge, and as they whirl around,
738880	742400	they create a tiny current and a tiny magnetic field.
742400	745120	Zooming even closer, each electron spins,
745120	749280	and this spin acts like the universe's teeniest, tiniest current,
749280	752240	creating the teeniest, tiniest electromagnet.
752240	756480	Okay look, whirl around and spin don't mean what you think down here,
756480	760720	because in the land of quantum, words mean nothing.
760720	763920	There is only math that we're not gonna do.
763920	765040	So just go with it.
765040	768720	Anyway, in most atoms, all these current-created tiny magnetic fields
768720	772640	arrange themselves against themselves, so it all cancels out to nothing.
772640	774960	But in a rare few atoms like iron,
774960	778400	does there happen to be an imbalance that aligns and adds up?
778400	781200	And thus, each iron atom is a tiny magnet.
781200	785040	And if adjacent atoms align, their little magnetic fields add up.
785040	789840	And zooming out and out and out, if all the atoms in the iron are aligned,
789840	793520	then the iron acts as one big monkey-sized magnet.
793520	797200	But deep down inside, it's just electron-sized electromagnets.
797200	801120	And scaling up and up and up and up to the whole Earth's magnetic field,
801120	803440	it's an electromagnet all over again.
803440	805120	See, the Earth is made of parts.
805120	807760	The thin, perilous, cool crust on which we live,
807760	811760	the inner solid core that is several thousands of degrees hot,
811760	815120	a middle mantle, mostly solid and relatively cool,
815120	819440	and, critically, a ring of metal liquefied by the hot, hot core.
819440	823280	And just as on the surface do hotspots cause convection currents of air
823280	825200	to try to even the energy out,
825200	831040	so too does the unbelievably hot inner core cause convection currents of liquid metal,
831040	835040	metal that happens to be mostly iron, our magnetic friend.
835040	840000	Thus, as this mixture circles, so do all its electrons, curving currents,
840000	842480	which gets us magnetic fields, baby!
842480	846320	Though, as individual coils, it's not very strong to start.
846320	849840	To get a planet-sized field, you need to somehow stack the coils,
849840	853120	which is where the Coriolis effect comes back in.
853120	857840	For just as Earth's spin causes convection currents of air into coils,
857840	863120	so too does Earth's spin cause convection currents of liquid metal to coil,
863120	864720	making the fields stronger,
864720	868640	turning the whole of the Earth into a giant electromagnet.
868640	869280	Wow.
869280	872000	If there's one thing the indifferent universe loves,
872000	875840	it's repeating the same patterns across scales and domains.
875840	878080	Such austere efficiency.
878080	879600	It's beautiful.
879600	880960	Oh, get back to the runways.
880960	884800	Oh, unlike a real electromagnet made of stable metal,
884800	889360	all that swirling liquid iron inside Earth is not stable.
889360	894320	So at any moment, the field can split into multiple magnetic poles,
894320	898000	roam randomly, or diminish entirely before,
898000	901680	oh my, flipping north to south and south to north,
901680	905120	which it does every couple hundred thousand years or so.
905120	907760	And we have no way of predicting when.
907760	908400	Great.
908400	909840	That'll cause some trouble.
909840	911680	And there's a clue that it's coming,
911680	915200	because the strength of Earth's magnetic field has dropped 10%
915200	917040	over the last couple hundred years,
917040	918800	which is concerning.
918800	922080	So, uh, if you're watching this video after the flip,
922080	926320	one, take everything I said about magnetic north and magnetic south,
926320	929120	and now it's the opposite, actually.
929120	933280	And two, if it's been a couple hundred thousand years since my last upload,
933280	935680	don't worry, that's about normal.
935680	939440	So be sure to smash that subscribe button,
939520	941520	so you don't miss the next video.
941520	942800	Oh, and hit the bell.
942800	944560	God, I hate that you have to do that now.
944560	945760	Oh, right, time to wrap this up.
945760	948080	First, this giant electromagnet made of liquid metal
948080	951040	coriolis-convecting inside Earth only semi-stably means
951040	952800	Earth's magnetic field moves.
952800	956800	That finishes with the physics and means the magnet north pole moves,
956800	959280	and quite a lot on human timescales.
959280	961840	When we started measuring, it was safely inside of Canada,
961840	963760	but it's recently rocketed north.
963760	966160	Geography over, so we can finally get back to the start,
966160	969520	since runway numbers are derived from the heading on a compass,
969520	974160	when the magnet north moves, the runway numbers need to change to match.
974160	977040	And the closer your airport is to a magnet pole,
977040	979360	the bigger a difference its movement makes,
979360	982560	and thus the more frequently you need to update the number.
982560	984720	Which is why it's no surprise that Canada,
984720	986720	with more northern runways than anyone,
986720	991520	was the first to get pretty tired of frequently repainting all her northern runways,
991600	996320	and so changed her system to be based on the unmoving math north instead.
996320	998880	But this means when flying over her territories,
998880	1003040	pilots can't count on their compass to match the runways and the winds.
1003040	1006000	They can use their GPS, assuming the battery is charged,
1006000	1011440	but these runway numbers are inconsistent with runways in the whole rest of the world.
1011440	1013360	Now, Canada thinks her system is better,
1013360	1018080	and has created an aviation agency to try to convince all her international friends,
1018080	1021120	with airports more equatorial and thus less of this problem,
1021120	1025840	to try and switch with her from the old and busted magnetic north to the new true north.
1025840	1028000	If pirates can do it, why not planes too?
1028000	1028560	Yarr!
1028560	1031120	Well, because it's mostly a problem for you.
1031120	1035360	And thus, there's not one system for numbering runways, but two.
1051520	1052960	Hey guys!
1052960	1057040	If you are going to switch to true north, best to get it done, like, before the poles flip?
1057040	1057600	Just sayin'!
