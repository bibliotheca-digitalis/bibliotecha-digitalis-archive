1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
While waiting on a plane during taxi till take-off, looking out the window,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,880
you may have noticed the giant number numbering the runway,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,560
say 8, which implies 7 others exist, at least,

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,960
but this is a flight out of LOL airport, in Nevada's desert of nothing.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
There's only two runways, which, given the passenger load,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
seems like maybe one too many already.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,280
What's the deal with runway numbers, you might wonder aloud?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,840
Oh, hello again! Flying to Nook as well, are you?

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,040
It is a long flight, so there's tons of time for me to tell you all about runways.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,920
Let's begin.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
So, before you can number a runway at an airport, you need to build the airport.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
And before you can build the airport, you need to plan the port.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,960
And what needs figuring first is which way to run the way.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,880
Pilots want runways with winds in parallel for physics reasons that we are going to skip,

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,680
both because lift physics is something people really like to argue about,

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,040
and this isn't a physics video.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,360
Yeah, I'm recording a runway video right now, hope you don't mind.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,640
But the summary is, planes take off and land into the wind,

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
because it lets them use less runway,

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,920
and makes for safer and stabler landings in particular.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,960
Now, planes can land with winds unaligned,

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,160
but it's unsettling to watch these crosswind attempts,

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,960
as pilots do their best to face into the wind,

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
while landing on a runway that does not.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,200
Oof.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,160
So, airports too want winds running with the runway,

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,800
but the universe is indifferent to human desires.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
Wind winds as it wants,

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,800
so the simple solution in aviation early days was to build a triangle of runways,

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,000
put up a little wind sock,

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,400
and direct the pilot to the runway that paralleled the sock, and thus the wind.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
But as aviation grew, so did airplanes, and thus their runways,

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
making the triangle trick impractical for big urban internationals.

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,080
But the simple sock still solved it.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,880
See, if you record when and which way the wind sock blows,

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
and with what wind force, you've grown yourself a wind rose,

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
a clever little data viz tool with the sock in the center

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,480
of compass points for orientation,

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,840
and bars colored in size for strength and frequency of wind.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Though it reads opposite, actually, of everyone's expectations,

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,320
with the lines showing the way the wind blows from and not to.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
Physics stuff just loves to opposite, actually.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,040
Let's just agree to avoid physics for this video, shall we?

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,480
Wind roses reverse readings aside, they reveal that in most places,

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
most of the time, most of the wind mostly blows back and forth in one direction.

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
So that's surprisingly convenient.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,080
Thanks, indifferent universe!

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
Oh, you did it for other reasons?

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Well, still, this convenient wind happens because wind is a current of air,

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
transporting heat from where there's more to where there's less.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,440
The Earth is blasted by the nuclear heat of the Sun,

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,520
with the equator getting hit hot hardest,

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,200
making hot air rise there as it cools out along the edge of space

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
before coming back down, creating a big-scale convection current

55
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
that repeats in a pattern all up and down.

56
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And because the Earth is a sphere that spins,

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,480
those cylindric convection currents of air on the surface

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,600
twist clockwise north of the equator and counter below.

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,440
This is the Coriolis effect, creating coiled currents of air everywhere,

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
which is cool, but also physics trying to sneak back into the video,

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
and this isn't a physics video.

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
All that matters is this creates the pretty stable pattern of trade winds,

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
and if you're planning a port, you need only know

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
which way does the wind mostly blow.

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Though, at some locations, the wind rose reveals two frequent directions of wind,

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,720
so if you want to constantly and safestly keep open the airport,

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
you're going to need to run a second way.

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
This is why many airports have an X or V layout like LOL.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
They're not necessarily doing double the traffic of a one-runway port,

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
but rather have double the chance of crosswinds

71
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,400
when the tower will need to reroute pilots

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,040
toward the other alignment for safer landings.

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,880
And once you have two of something, you need names or numbers.

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Sure, you could just go with run one and run two,

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,040
but pro tip, try never to use the very first thing that comes to mind

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,960
without giving it a bit of a ponder first,

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,160
and the wind rose reveals a better way with the compass points,

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,040
which form a circle of 360 degrees,

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
starting at zero north, east 90, south 180, west 270,

80
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
and back to north makes it 360 as well.

81
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
These compass degrees come from ships of the seas,

82
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,600
because captains and quartermasters, when in the vast featureless nothing,

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,720
could still count on their compass to point toward the north pole,

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
assuming no iron hooks happen nearby,

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
and with north as a fixed navigational point,

86
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
could then communicate their heading with names broadly,

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,200
east-southeast, or numbers precisely, helm to 108.

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,920
Quite handy!

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,320
So it's no surprise these compass headings got passed from sea ships to airships.

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,200
Thus, on the wind rose devised plans for any airport,

91
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,160
the runway is already aligned with navigational numbers begging to be used.

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
But before grabbing the obvious one, again, ponder for a moment.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
The runway points from the perspective of the port toward the plane.

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,640
The rather more important heading to use

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,440
is from the plane's perspective approaching the port,

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
which on the plan is at the opposite end, actually,

97
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,120
because it's what number matches the compass in the cockpit that's critical.

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Alright, this needs a couple of example airports.

99
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Take one with a north-south runway.

100
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
When the wind blows from the north to the south,

101
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,640
the tower directs pilots to approach from the south,

102
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,560
meaning they need to point the plane north,

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,920
which on their compass is a heading of 360 degrees.

104
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,560
So let's put a big 360 on that end for now.

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
When the winds reverse, the tower directs pilots to approach from the north

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,640
to fly south, which reads 180.

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
So let's put a big 180 on that end as well.

108
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,400
Now that we've got our heading numbers,

109
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,640
the convention is to round them to 10 and cut off the zero for the runway number,

110
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,120
because we don't need three sig figs of precision

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
when airports have single digit numbers of runways,

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
and the very stressed air traffic controllers in the tower

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,600
need to repeat precisely these numbers hundreds of times a day.

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
So saving syllables here really matters.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,880
Thus, when the tower tells the plane to use runway 36,

116
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
the pilot knows they need to get south of the airport to land facing north,

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,560
and while there are like a million indicators in a cockpit,

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,040
the pilot can always confirm they're doing it right

119
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
by reading 360 on their ancient ancestor's compass.

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
This low-tech check is useful as a fallback

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,600
because a compass can see the way even when eyes and other equipment cannot.

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
As a two-runway example,

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
an airport with a perfect ordinal X would get numbered thusly.

124
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,040
Northwest to southeast gives 315 for one end,

125
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,800
because that's the way the pilot needs to point,

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,480
and 135 at the other.

127
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Round to 10 for 320 and 140,

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
then drop the zeros to get runways 32 and 14.

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
On the other side, 225 and 45,

130
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,920
round to 10 again, drop the zeros for 23 and 5.

131
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
Now, when the towers talk to the pilots,

132
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
they say each digit individually, so runway 23,

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
because clarity here is critical,

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,080
which is also why the font and exact size of these digits is standardized worldwide.

135
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,760
Though there are disagreements between the abundant aviation agencies

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,160
as to if single-digit runways like 6 should have a leading zero for clarity,

137
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
or if that leading zero should only be in our hearts.

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,920
Which it shouldn't be.

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Anyway, that's the surprisingly good system behind numbering these numbers,

140
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,440
which is always a delight to discover,

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,920
unlike some other numbers I could mention.

142
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Though there are a couple of wrinkles.

143
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,040
For, think about it,

144
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,080
if the wind mostly blows back and forth in most places,

145
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,120
then most big busy urban international airports will need multiple runways in parallel.

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,840
But parallel runways have the same heading,

147
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,920
thus the same number under this system,

148
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
which would be unclear for pilots to say the least.

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
So all the agencies assembled to agree.

150
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
If you have two parallel runways,

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
they will have the same number,

152
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,760
but add an L or an R for left and right.

153
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,840
If you need to construct a third runway,

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,600
add a C for center too.

155
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,640
But with four more,

156
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,760
two runways will get the correct heading number with L and R,

157
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,200
but the others,

158
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,800
they're going to get the next closest numbers,

159
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,520
but not exactly correct numbers.

160
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Which is practical, I suppose.

161
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
But also,

162
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,480
ahh, it's all slightly misaligned.

163
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
It's big airports.

164
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,680
Like, it doesn't line up.

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
Like, just try not to think about it, okay?

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
Just try not to think about it.

167
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
Oh, we're landing at Nook already?

168
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
Wow, flights fly fast when you're flapping about flying.

169
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
Time to put this knowledge to use.

170
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,200
Our compass heading reads 42 degrees,

171
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,960
so round 210, 440,

172
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
cut the zero and we'll be landing on runway zero four.

173
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
And since there's only one runway at Nook,

174
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
it'll be perfectly aligned.

175
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
No doubt about that.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh, it's five, not four.

177
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,040
How embarrassing.

178
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,960
I guess I need to delete this video now.

179
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,920
Hey, why are you painting a new runway number?

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
You do that every few decades?

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,400
That must mean...

182
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
ohhh.

183
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,080
Runway numbers depend on where the north pole is,

184
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
and so watch out!

185
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
There's a geography video inside this video called

186
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Where is the North Pole Really?

187
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Okay, to find the north pole,

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,560
remember that the Earth is a sphere that spins.

189
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, sorry, we already went over that.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,320
We draw a line about which this spin occurs

191
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
and name each end the north and south pole.

192
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Starting with these poles,

193
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
we clever humans created a square-ish coordinate system for our spherical Earth,

194
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
the detailed creation of which I'm going to skip

195
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
because that's a physics story for a never time

196
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,400
that took hundreds of years and needed lots of clocks.

197
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
And to make it official that London rules and Paris drools.

198
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,920
But anyway, this grid is what every modern navigational system uses

199
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,160
to get around with the GPS, Global Positioning, coordinates it gives.

200
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,760
But if you were to use your GPS to direct you to the north pole

201
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
so that you could experience the planet rotating you in place,

202
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,840
as the stars circled overhead and you pondered the scale of the indifferent universe

203
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,960
and your tiny, tiny existence within it,

204
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,360
if you took out your compass to double check that the GPS got the spot right,

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,760
the compass points you over the horizon toward another north pole.

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
What gives compass?

207
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,400
Well, what did you expect?

208
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,000
A compass is a magnet and magnets follow magnetic fields.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,840
That's like their only thing?

210
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,200
It's not a math magnet.

211
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
Your magnet compass will take you to the gigantic magnetic field

212
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
spewing forth from inside the Earth.

213
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,800
So there are two north poles, one for math and one for magnets.

214
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I mean, I guess if you want to be technical about it,

215
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,840
there are three north poles because the magnetic field,

216
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,880
the north pole of a magnet points to is the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field

217
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
because opposites attract.

218
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,120
But look, we're just going to ignore that because this isn't a physics video

219
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
and there's been enough, oh, it's the opposite actually already.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
And yes, I know you can define more norths, but we're moving on.

221
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
There are two norths, math and magnets.

222
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,400
The compass points to the magnetic north and the GPS points to the geographic north.

223
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,000
They don't have anything to do with each other,

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,840
but for navigation, humans have used both.

225
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,280
One isn't better than the other, though math slash geographic north

226
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,960
is now often called true north,

227
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,160
which feels a bit like humans picking the new one as their favorite one.

228
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,760
Oh, and ships of the seas have stopped using the old magnetic north

229
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
and now navigate with GPS using the true north, even modern pirates,

230
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
but planes and pilots still love the traditional magnet north.

231
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
And we can stop thinking about this because they're pretty close anyway.

232
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Although, isn't that kind of weird,

233
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,960
just how close the unrelated poles are on a planetary scale?

234
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,400
Earth just so happens to have a giant magnet that's sort of,

235
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,520
but not quite lines up with the planet's top and bottom.

236
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,720
In different universes, are these things secretly related?

237
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,960
And still, why would runway numbers change

238
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,320
just because they're pointing at the magnet one, but not the math one?

239
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,600
Oh no, there really is an unavoidable physics video inside this geography video,

240
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
and it's called

241
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
Magnets. What's your deal?

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Okay, we really can't cover everything about magnets because it's just so much,

243
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,840
but some bits of some metal, such as iron, generate around them a magnetic field.

244
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Why and how were a mystery for a long time,

245
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,400
until we discovered that if you take a wire

246
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,200
and run a current of electrons through it, aka electricity,

247
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,640
this current also generates a magnetic field around the wire.

248
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
But weirder, if you start with a current of electrons

249
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
and pop them in a magnetic field, the current will curve.

250
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,440
And oh look, you've stumbled upon a clue

251
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
to one of the fundamental secrets of the universe.

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,040
Magnets and electricity are two expressions of the same thing, electromagnetism.

253
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,520
That's why in science class, you can coil up a wire,

254
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,360
send a current of electricity through it, and the whole thing becomes a magnet.

255
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
One you can make stronger and stronger with each additional coil,

256
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
cause curving currents are magnets.

257
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
Which is why when you cut the current, everything drops.

258
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,400
Our just iron magnets are doing the same thing,

259
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,240
but you need to zoom down and down and down and down

260
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,080
to the atomic level to see.

261
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,880
Here, an atom of iron has a cloud of electrons,

262
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
each electron with a charge, and as they whirl around,

263
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,400
they create a tiny current and a tiny magnetic field.

264
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,120
Zooming even closer, each electron spins,

265
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,280
and this spin acts like the universe's teeniest, tiniest current,

266
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,240
creating the teeniest, tiniest electromagnet.

267
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay look, whirl around and spin don't mean what you think down here,

268
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
because in the land of quantum, words mean nothing.

269
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,920
There is only math that we're not gonna do.

270
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
So just go with it.

271
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,720
Anyway, in most atoms, all these current-created tiny magnetic fields

272
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,640
arrange themselves against themselves, so it all cancels out to nothing.

273
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,960
But in a rare few atoms like iron,

274
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,400
does there happen to be an imbalance that aligns and adds up?

275
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,200
And thus, each iron atom is a tiny magnet.

276
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
And if adjacent atoms align, their little magnetic fields add up.

277
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,840
And zooming out and out and out, if all the atoms in the iron are aligned,

278
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,520
then the iron acts as one big monkey-sized magnet.

279
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,200
But deep down inside, it's just electron-sized electromagnets.

280
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
And scaling up and up and up and up to the whole Earth's magnetic field,

281
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
it's an electromagnet all over again.

282
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
See, the Earth is made of parts.

283
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,760
The thin, perilous, cool crust on which we live,

284
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
the inner solid core that is several thousands of degrees hot,

285
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
a middle mantle, mostly solid and relatively cool,

286
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,440
and, critically, a ring of metal liquefied by the hot, hot core.

287
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,280
And just as on the surface do hotspots cause convection currents of air

288
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,200
to try to even the energy out,

289
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,040
so too does the unbelievably hot inner core cause convection currents of liquid metal,

290
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
metal that happens to be mostly iron, our magnetic friend.

291
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,000
Thus, as this mixture circles, so do all its electrons, curving currents,

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
which gets us magnetic fields, baby!

293
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,320
Though, as individual coils, it's not very strong to start.

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,840
To get a planet-sized field, you need to somehow stack the coils,

295
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,120
which is where the Coriolis effect comes back in.

296
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,840
For just as Earth's spin causes convection currents of air into coils,

297
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,120
so too does Earth's spin cause convection currents of liquid metal to coil,

298
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
making the fields stronger,

299
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,640
turning the whole of the Earth into a giant electromagnet.

300
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,280
Wow.

301
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,000
If there's one thing the indifferent universe loves,

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,840
it's repeating the same patterns across scales and domains.

303
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,080
Such austere efficiency.

304
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,600
It's beautiful.

305
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Oh, get back to the runways.

306
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh, unlike a real electromagnet made of stable metal,

307
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,360
all that swirling liquid iron inside Earth is not stable.

308
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,320
So at any moment, the field can split into multiple magnetic poles,

309
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
roam randomly, or diminish entirely before,

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,680
oh my, flipping north to south and south to north,

311
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
which it does every couple hundred thousand years or so.

312
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
And we have no way of predicting when.

313
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,400
Great.

314
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,840
That'll cause some trouble.

315
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,680
And there's a clue that it's coming,

316
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,200
because the strength of Earth's magnetic field has dropped 10%

317
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
over the last couple hundred years,

318
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
which is concerning.

319
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,080
So, uh, if you're watching this video after the flip,

320
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,320
one, take everything I said about magnetic north and magnetic south,

321
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
and now it's the opposite, actually.

322
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,280
And two, if it's been a couple hundred thousand years since my last upload,

323
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,680
don't worry, that's about normal.

324
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
So be sure to smash that subscribe button,

325
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
so you don't miss the next video.

326
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,800
Oh, and hit the bell.

327
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
God, I hate that you have to do that now.

328
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,760
Oh, right, time to wrap this up.

329
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,080
First, this giant electromagnet made of liquid metal

330
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,040
coriolis-convecting inside Earth only semi-stably means

331
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
Earth's magnetic field moves.

332
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
That finishes with the physics and means the magnet north pole moves,

333
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,280
and quite a lot on human timescales.

334
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,840
When we started measuring, it was safely inside of Canada,

335
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,760
but it's recently rocketed north.

336
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,160
Geography over, so we can finally get back to the start,

337
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,520
since runway numbers are derived from the heading on a compass,

338
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,160
when the magnet north moves, the runway numbers need to change to match.

339
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,040
And the closer your airport is to a magnet pole,

340
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
the bigger a difference its movement makes,

341
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
and thus the more frequently you need to update the number.

342
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
Which is why it's no surprise that Canada,

343
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
with more northern runways than anyone,

344
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,520
was the first to get pretty tired of frequently repainting all her northern runways,

345
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,320
and so changed her system to be based on the unmoving math north instead.

346
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,880
But this means when flying over her territories,

347
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,040
pilots can't count on their compass to match the runways and the winds.

348
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
They can use their GPS, assuming the battery is charged,

349
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,440
but these runway numbers are inconsistent with runways in the whole rest of the world.

350
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,360
Now, Canada thinks her system is better,

351
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,080
and has created an aviation agency to try to convince all her international friends,

352
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,120
with airports more equatorial and thus less of this problem,

353
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,840
to try and switch with her from the old and busted magnetic north to the new true north.

354
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,000
If pirates can do it, why not planes too?

355
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,560
Yarr!

356
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,120
Well, because it's mostly a problem for you.

357
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,360
And thus, there's not one system for numbering runways, but two.

358
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
Hey guys!

359
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,040
If you are going to switch to true north, best to get it done, like, before the poles flip?

360
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,600
Just sayin'!
