00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
While waiting on a plane during taxi till take-off, looking out the window,

00:03.800 --> 00:06.880
you may have noticed the giant number numbering the runway,

00:06.880 --> 00:10.560
say 8, which implies 7 others exist, at least,

00:10.560 --> 00:14.960
but this is a flight out of LOL airport, in Nevada's desert of nothing.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.920
There's only two runways, which, given the passenger load,

00:17.920 --> 00:20.400
seems like maybe one too many already.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.280
What's the deal with runway numbers, you might wonder aloud?

00:23.280 --> 00:25.840
Oh, hello again! Flying to Nook as well, are you?

00:25.840 --> 00:31.040
It is a long flight, so there's tons of time for me to tell you all about runways.

00:31.040 --> 00:31.920
Let's begin.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.000
So, before you can number a runway at an airport, you need to build the airport.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.280
And before you can build the airport, you need to plan the port.

00:39.280 --> 00:42.960
And what needs figuring first is which way to run the way.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.880
Pilots want runways with winds in parallel for physics reasons that we are going to skip,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.680
both because lift physics is something people really like to argue about,

00:49.680 --> 00:51.040
and this isn't a physics video.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.360
Yeah, I'm recording a runway video right now, hope you don't mind.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.640
But the summary is, planes take off and land into the wind,

00:56.640 --> 00:58.800
because it lets them use less runway,

00:58.800 --> 01:01.920
and makes for safer and stabler landings in particular.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.960
Now, planes can land with winds unaligned,

01:04.960 --> 01:08.160
but it's unsettling to watch these crosswind attempts,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.960
as pilots do their best to face into the wind,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.760
while landing on a runway that does not.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.200
Oof.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.160
So, airports too want winds running with the runway,

01:18.160 --> 01:20.800
but the universe is indifferent to human desires.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.160
Wind winds as it wants,

01:22.160 --> 01:26.800
so the simple solution in aviation early days was to build a triangle of runways,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.000
put up a little wind sock,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.400
and direct the pilot to the runway that paralleled the sock, and thus the wind.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.320
But as aviation grew, so did airplanes, and thus their runways,

01:36.320 --> 01:40.320
making the triangle trick impractical for big urban internationals.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.080
But the simple sock still solved it.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.880
See, if you record when and which way the wind sock blows,

01:44.880 --> 01:47.680
and with what wind force, you've grown yourself a wind rose,

01:47.680 --> 01:50.640
a clever little data viz tool with the sock in the center

01:50.640 --> 01:52.480
of compass points for orientation,

01:52.480 --> 01:55.840
and bars colored in size for strength and frequency of wind.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.840
Though it reads opposite, actually, of everyone's expectations,

01:59.840 --> 02:04.320
with the lines showing the way the wind blows from and not to.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.640
Physics stuff just loves to opposite, actually.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.040
Let's just agree to avoid physics for this video, shall we?

02:09.040 --> 02:12.480
Wind roses reverse readings aside, they reveal that in most places,

02:12.480 --> 02:16.560
most of the time, most of the wind mostly blows back and forth in one direction.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.640
So that's surprisingly convenient.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.080
Thanks, indifferent universe!

02:20.080 --> 02:21.520
Oh, you did it for other reasons?

02:21.520 --> 02:25.360
Well, still, this convenient wind happens because wind is a current of air,

02:25.360 --> 02:28.160
transporting heat from where there's more to where there's less.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.440
The Earth is blasted by the nuclear heat of the Sun,

02:31.440 --> 02:33.520
with the equator getting hit hot hardest,

02:33.520 --> 02:37.200
making hot air rise there as it cools out along the edge of space

02:37.200 --> 02:41.200
before coming back down, creating a big-scale convection current

02:41.200 --> 02:43.600
that repeats in a pattern all up and down.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.600
And because the Earth is a sphere that spins,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.480
those cylindric convection currents of air on the surface

02:48.480 --> 02:51.600
twist clockwise north of the equator and counter below.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.440
This is the Coriolis effect, creating coiled currents of air everywhere,

02:55.440 --> 02:59.120
which is cool, but also physics trying to sneak back into the video,

02:59.120 --> 03:00.400
and this isn't a physics video.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.000
All that matters is this creates the pretty stable pattern of trade winds,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.560
and if you're planning a port, you need only know

03:06.560 --> 03:09.120
which way does the wind mostly blow.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.120
Though, at some locations, the wind rose reveals two frequent directions of wind,

03:13.120 --> 03:16.720
so if you want to constantly and safestly keep open the airport,

03:16.720 --> 03:19.120
you're going to need to run a second way.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.800
This is why many airports have an X or V layout like LOL.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.000
They're not necessarily doing double the traffic of a one-runway port,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.320
but rather have double the chance of crosswinds

03:28.320 --> 03:30.400
when the tower will need to reroute pilots

03:30.400 --> 03:33.040
toward the other alignment for safer landings.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.880
And once you have two of something, you need names or numbers.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.520
Sure, you could just go with run one and run two,

03:39.520 --> 03:43.040
but pro tip, try never to use the very first thing that comes to mind

03:43.040 --> 03:44.960
without giving it a bit of a ponder first,

03:44.960 --> 03:48.160
and the wind rose reveals a better way with the compass points,

03:48.160 --> 03:51.040
which form a circle of 360 degrees,

03:51.040 --> 03:55.040
starting at zero north, east 90, south 180, west 270,

03:55.040 --> 03:57.280
and back to north makes it 360 as well.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.680
These compass degrees come from ships of the seas,

03:59.680 --> 04:03.600
because captains and quartermasters, when in the vast featureless nothing,

04:03.600 --> 04:06.720
could still count on their compass to point toward the north pole,

04:06.720 --> 04:08.640
assuming no iron hooks happen nearby,

04:08.640 --> 04:11.120
and with north as a fixed navigational point,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.840
could then communicate their heading with names broadly,

04:13.840 --> 04:17.200
east-southeast, or numbers precisely, helm to 108.

04:17.200 --> 04:17.920
Quite handy!

04:17.920 --> 04:22.320
So it's no surprise these compass headings got passed from sea ships to airships.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.200
Thus, on the wind rose devised plans for any airport,

04:25.200 --> 04:30.160
the runway is already aligned with navigational numbers begging to be used.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.160
But before grabbing the obvious one, again, ponder for a moment.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.160
The runway points from the perspective of the port toward the plane.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.640
The rather more important heading to use

04:40.640 --> 04:43.440
is from the plane's perspective approaching the port,

04:43.440 --> 04:46.880
which on the plan is at the opposite end, actually,

04:46.880 --> 04:51.120
because it's what number matches the compass in the cockpit that's critical.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.880
Alright, this needs a couple of example airports.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.880
Take one with a north-south runway.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.360
When the wind blows from the north to the south,

04:57.360 --> 05:00.640
the tower directs pilots to approach from the south,

05:00.640 --> 05:02.560
meaning they need to point the plane north,

05:02.560 --> 05:05.920
which on their compass is a heading of 360 degrees.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.560
So let's put a big 360 on that end for now.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.400
When the winds reverse, the tower directs pilots to approach from the north

05:12.400 --> 05:14.640
to fly south, which reads 180.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.040
So let's put a big 180 on that end as well.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.400
Now that we've got our heading numbers,

05:18.400 --> 05:22.640
the convention is to round them to 10 and cut off the zero for the runway number,

05:22.640 --> 05:25.120
because we don't need three sig figs of precision

05:25.120 --> 05:28.240
when airports have single digit numbers of runways,

05:28.240 --> 05:31.840
and the very stressed air traffic controllers in the tower

05:31.840 --> 05:35.600
need to repeat precisely these numbers hundreds of times a day.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.000
So saving syllables here really matters.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.880
Thus, when the tower tells the plane to use runway 36,

05:40.880 --> 05:45.120
the pilot knows they need to get south of the airport to land facing north,

05:45.120 --> 05:48.560
and while there are like a million indicators in a cockpit,

05:48.560 --> 05:51.040
the pilot can always confirm they're doing it right

05:51.040 --> 05:54.560
by reading 360 on their ancient ancestor's compass.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.040
This low-tech check is useful as a fallback

05:57.040 --> 06:01.600
because a compass can see the way even when eyes and other equipment cannot.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.960
As a two-runway example,

06:02.960 --> 06:06.080
an airport with a perfect ordinal X would get numbered thusly.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.040
Northwest to southeast gives 315 for one end,

06:09.040 --> 06:10.800
because that's the way the pilot needs to point,

06:10.800 --> 06:12.480
and 135 at the other.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.800
Round to 10 for 320 and 140,

06:14.800 --> 06:18.160
then drop the zeros to get runways 32 and 14.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.560
On the other side, 225 and 45,

06:20.560 --> 06:23.920
round to 10 again, drop the zeros for 23 and 5.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.520
Now, when the towers talk to the pilots,

06:25.520 --> 06:28.880
they say each digit individually, so runway 23,

06:28.880 --> 06:30.720
because clarity here is critical,

06:30.720 --> 06:36.080
which is also why the font and exact size of these digits is standardized worldwide.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.760
Though there are disagreements between the abundant aviation agencies

06:39.760 --> 06:44.160
as to if single-digit runways like 6 should have a leading zero for clarity,

06:44.160 --> 06:46.800
or if that leading zero should only be in our hearts.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.920
Which it shouldn't be.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.520
Anyway, that's the surprisingly good system behind numbering these numbers,

06:51.520 --> 06:53.440
which is always a delight to discover,

06:53.440 --> 06:55.920
unlike some other numbers I could mention.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.160
Though there are a couple of wrinkles.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.040
For, think about it,

06:59.040 --> 07:02.080
if the wind mostly blows back and forth in most places,

07:02.080 --> 07:07.120
then most big busy urban international airports will need multiple runways in parallel.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.840
But parallel runways have the same heading,

07:09.840 --> 07:11.920
thus the same number under this system,

07:11.920 --> 07:15.280
which would be unclear for pilots to say the least.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.440
So all the agencies assembled to agree.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.360
If you have two parallel runways,

07:19.360 --> 07:20.720
they will have the same number,

07:20.720 --> 07:23.760
but add an L or an R for left and right.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.840
If you need to construct a third runway,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.600
add a C for center too.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.640
But with four more,

07:28.640 --> 07:31.760
two runways will get the correct heading number with L and R,

07:31.840 --> 07:33.200
but the others,

07:33.200 --> 07:36.800
they're going to get the next closest numbers,

07:36.800 --> 07:39.520
but not exactly correct numbers.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.240
Which is practical, I suppose.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.360
But also,

07:43.360 --> 07:46.480
ahh, it's all slightly misaligned.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.760
It's big airports.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.680
Like, it doesn't line up.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.360
Like, just try not to think about it, okay?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.320
Just try not to think about it.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.720
Oh, we're landing at Nook already?

07:54.720 --> 07:57.280
Wow, flights fly fast when you're flapping about flying.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.960
Time to put this knowledge to use.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.200
Our compass heading reads 42 degrees,

08:01.200 --> 08:02.960
so round 210, 440,

08:02.960 --> 08:06.240
cut the zero and we'll be landing on runway zero four.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
And since there's only one runway at Nook,

08:08.240 --> 08:10.080
it'll be perfectly aligned.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.520
No doubt about that.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.960
Oh, it's five, not four.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.040
How embarrassing.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.960
I guess I need to delete this video now.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.920
Hey, why are you painting a new runway number?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.600
You do that every few decades?

08:23.600 --> 08:24.400
That must mean...

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
ohhh.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.080
Runway numbers depend on where the north pole is,

08:30.080 --> 08:31.520
and so watch out!

08:31.520 --> 08:35.120
There's a geography video inside this video called

08:35.120 --> 08:37.200
Where is the North Pole Really?

08:37.200 --> 08:38.400
Okay, to find the north pole,

08:38.400 --> 08:40.560
remember that the Earth is a sphere that spins.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.000
Oh, sorry, we already went over that.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.320
We draw a line about which this spin occurs

08:44.320 --> 08:46.640
and name each end the north and south pole.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.600
Starting with these poles,

08:47.600 --> 08:51.680
we clever humans created a square-ish coordinate system for our spherical Earth,

08:51.680 --> 08:53.360
the detailed creation of which I'm going to skip

08:53.360 --> 08:55.520
because that's a physics story for a never time

08:55.520 --> 08:58.400
that took hundreds of years and needed lots of clocks.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
And to make it official that London rules and Paris drools.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.920
But anyway, this grid is what every modern navigational system uses

09:03.920 --> 09:08.160
to get around with the GPS, Global Positioning, coordinates it gives.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.760
But if you were to use your GPS to direct you to the north pole

09:11.760 --> 09:15.120
so that you could experience the planet rotating you in place,

09:15.120 --> 09:19.840
as the stars circled overhead and you pondered the scale of the indifferent universe

09:19.840 --> 09:22.960
and your tiny, tiny existence within it,

09:22.960 --> 09:27.360
if you took out your compass to double check that the GPS got the spot right,

09:27.360 --> 09:31.760
the compass points you over the horizon toward another north pole.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.040
What gives compass?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.400
Well, what did you expect?

09:34.400 --> 09:38.000
A compass is a magnet and magnets follow magnetic fields.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.840
That's like their only thing?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.200
It's not a math magnet.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.120
Your magnet compass will take you to the gigantic magnetic field

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
spewing forth from inside the Earth.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.800
So there are two north poles, one for math and one for magnets.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
I mean, I guess if you want to be technical about it,

09:53.200 --> 09:55.840
there are three north poles because the magnetic field,

09:55.840 --> 10:00.880
the north pole of a magnet points to is the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field

10:00.880 --> 10:02.240
because opposites attract.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.120
But look, we're just going to ignore that because this isn't a physics video

10:05.120 --> 10:08.000
and there's been enough, oh, it's the opposite actually already.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.040
And yes, I know you can define more norths, but we're moving on.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.720
There are two norths, math and magnets.

10:12.720 --> 10:16.400
The compass points to the magnetic north and the GPS points to the geographic north.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.000
They don't have anything to do with each other,

10:18.000 --> 10:19.840
but for navigation, humans have used both.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.280
One isn't better than the other, though math slash geographic north

10:23.280 --> 10:24.960
is now often called true north,

10:24.960 --> 10:28.160
which feels a bit like humans picking the new one as their favorite one.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.760
Oh, and ships of the seas have stopped using the old magnetic north

10:31.760 --> 10:35.120
and now navigate with GPS using the true north, even modern pirates,

10:35.120 --> 10:38.320
but planes and pilots still love the traditional magnet north.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.600
And we can stop thinking about this because they're pretty close anyway.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.800
Although, isn't that kind of weird,

10:44.800 --> 10:48.960
just how close the unrelated poles are on a planetary scale?

10:48.960 --> 10:52.400
Earth just so happens to have a giant magnet that's sort of,

10:52.400 --> 10:55.520
but not quite lines up with the planet's top and bottom.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.720
In different universes, are these things secretly related?

10:58.720 --> 11:00.960
And still, why would runway numbers change

11:00.960 --> 11:04.320
just because they're pointing at the magnet one, but not the math one?

11:04.320 --> 11:09.600
Oh no, there really is an unavoidable physics video inside this geography video,

11:09.600 --> 11:10.480
and it's called

11:10.480 --> 11:12.320
Magnets. What's your deal?

11:12.320 --> 11:17.280
Okay, we really can't cover everything about magnets because it's just so much,

11:17.280 --> 11:21.840
but some bits of some metal, such as iron, generate around them a magnetic field.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.640
Why and how were a mystery for a long time,

11:24.640 --> 11:26.400
until we discovered that if you take a wire

11:26.400 --> 11:29.200
and run a current of electrons through it, aka electricity,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.640
this current also generates a magnetic field around the wire.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.680
But weirder, if you start with a current of electrons

11:35.680 --> 11:38.800
and pop them in a magnetic field, the current will curve.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.440
And oh look, you've stumbled upon a clue

11:41.440 --> 11:44.000
to one of the fundamental secrets of the universe.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.040
Magnets and electricity are two expressions of the same thing, electromagnetism.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.520
That's why in science class, you can coil up a wire,

11:51.520 --> 11:55.360
send a current of electricity through it, and the whole thing becomes a magnet.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.560
One you can make stronger and stronger with each additional coil,

11:58.560 --> 12:01.040
cause curving currents are magnets.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.920
Which is why when you cut the current, everything drops.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.400
Our just iron magnets are doing the same thing,

12:06.400 --> 12:10.240
but you need to zoom down and down and down and down

12:10.240 --> 12:12.080
to the atomic level to see.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.880
Here, an atom of iron has a cloud of electrons,

12:14.880 --> 12:18.880
each electron with a charge, and as they whirl around,

12:18.880 --> 12:22.400
they create a tiny current and a tiny magnetic field.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.120
Zooming even closer, each electron spins,

12:25.120 --> 12:29.280
and this spin acts like the universe's teeniest, tiniest current,

12:29.280 --> 12:32.240
creating the teeniest, tiniest electromagnet.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.480
Okay look, whirl around and spin don't mean what you think down here,

12:36.480 --> 12:40.720
because in the land of quantum, words mean nothing.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.920
There is only math that we're not gonna do.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.040
So just go with it.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.720
Anyway, in most atoms, all these current-created tiny magnetic fields

12:48.720 --> 12:52.640
arrange themselves against themselves, so it all cancels out to nothing.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.960
But in a rare few atoms like iron,

12:54.960 --> 12:58.400
does there happen to be an imbalance that aligns and adds up?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.200
And thus, each iron atom is a tiny magnet.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.040
And if adjacent atoms align, their little magnetic fields add up.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.840
And zooming out and out and out, if all the atoms in the iron are aligned,

13:09.840 --> 13:13.520
then the iron acts as one big monkey-sized magnet.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.200
But deep down inside, it's just electron-sized electromagnets.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.120
And scaling up and up and up and up to the whole Earth's magnetic field,

13:21.120 --> 13:23.440
it's an electromagnet all over again.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.120
See, the Earth is made of parts.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.760
The thin, perilous, cool crust on which we live,

13:27.760 --> 13:31.760
the inner solid core that is several thousands of degrees hot,

13:31.760 --> 13:35.120
a middle mantle, mostly solid and relatively cool,

13:35.120 --> 13:39.440
and, critically, a ring of metal liquefied by the hot, hot core.

13:39.440 --> 13:43.280
And just as on the surface do hotspots cause convection currents of air

13:43.280 --> 13:45.200
to try to even the energy out,

13:45.200 --> 13:51.040
so too does the unbelievably hot inner core cause convection currents of liquid metal,

13:51.040 --> 13:55.040
metal that happens to be mostly iron, our magnetic friend.

13:55.040 --> 14:00.000
Thus, as this mixture circles, so do all its electrons, curving currents,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.480
which gets us magnetic fields, baby!

14:02.480 --> 14:06.320
Though, as individual coils, it's not very strong to start.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.840
To get a planet-sized field, you need to somehow stack the coils,

14:09.840 --> 14:13.120
which is where the Coriolis effect comes back in.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.840
For just as Earth's spin causes convection currents of air into coils,

14:17.840 --> 14:23.120
so too does Earth's spin cause convection currents of liquid metal to coil,

14:23.120 --> 14:24.720
making the fields stronger,

14:24.720 --> 14:28.640
turning the whole of the Earth into a giant electromagnet.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.280
Wow.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.000
If there's one thing the indifferent universe loves,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.840
it's repeating the same patterns across scales and domains.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.080
Such austere efficiency.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.600
It's beautiful.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.960
Oh, get back to the runways.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.800
Oh, unlike a real electromagnet made of stable metal,

14:44.800 --> 14:49.360
all that swirling liquid iron inside Earth is not stable.

14:49.360 --> 14:54.320
So at any moment, the field can split into multiple magnetic poles,

14:54.320 --> 14:58.000
roam randomly, or diminish entirely before,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.680
oh my, flipping north to south and south to north,

15:01.680 --> 15:05.120
which it does every couple hundred thousand years or so.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.760
And we have no way of predicting when.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.400
Great.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.840
That'll cause some trouble.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.680
And there's a clue that it's coming,

15:11.680 --> 15:15.200
because the strength of Earth's magnetic field has dropped 10%

15:15.200 --> 15:17.040
over the last couple hundred years,

15:17.040 --> 15:18.800
which is concerning.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.080
So, uh, if you're watching this video after the flip,

15:22.080 --> 15:26.320
one, take everything I said about magnetic north and magnetic south,

15:26.320 --> 15:29.120
and now it's the opposite, actually.

15:29.120 --> 15:33.280
And two, if it's been a couple hundred thousand years since my last upload,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.680
don't worry, that's about normal.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.440
So be sure to smash that subscribe button,

15:39.520 --> 15:41.520
so you don't miss the next video.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.800
Oh, and hit the bell.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.560
God, I hate that you have to do that now.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.760
Oh, right, time to wrap this up.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.080
First, this giant electromagnet made of liquid metal

15:48.080 --> 15:51.040
coriolis-convecting inside Earth only semi-stably means

15:51.040 --> 15:52.800
Earth's magnetic field moves.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.800
That finishes with the physics and means the magnet north pole moves,

15:56.800 --> 15:59.280
and quite a lot on human timescales.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.840
When we started measuring, it was safely inside of Canada,

16:01.840 --> 16:03.760
but it's recently rocketed north.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.160
Geography over, so we can finally get back to the start,

16:06.160 --> 16:09.520
since runway numbers are derived from the heading on a compass,

16:09.520 --> 16:14.160
when the magnet north moves, the runway numbers need to change to match.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.040
And the closer your airport is to a magnet pole,

16:17.040 --> 16:19.360
the bigger a difference its movement makes,

16:19.360 --> 16:22.560
and thus the more frequently you need to update the number.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.720
Which is why it's no surprise that Canada,

16:24.720 --> 16:26.720
with more northern runways than anyone,

16:26.720 --> 16:31.520
was the first to get pretty tired of frequently repainting all her northern runways,

16:31.600 --> 16:36.320
and so changed her system to be based on the unmoving math north instead.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.880
But this means when flying over her territories,

16:38.880 --> 16:43.040
pilots can't count on their compass to match the runways and the winds.

16:43.040 --> 16:46.000
They can use their GPS, assuming the battery is charged,

16:46.000 --> 16:51.440
but these runway numbers are inconsistent with runways in the whole rest of the world.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.360
Now, Canada thinks her system is better,

16:53.360 --> 16:58.080
and has created an aviation agency to try to convince all her international friends,

16:58.080 --> 17:01.120
with airports more equatorial and thus less of this problem,

17:01.120 --> 17:05.840
to try and switch with her from the old and busted magnetic north to the new true north.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.000
If pirates can do it, why not planes too?

17:08.000 --> 17:08.560
Yarr!

17:08.560 --> 17:11.120
Well, because it's mostly a problem for you.

17:11.120 --> 17:15.360
And thus, there's not one system for numbering runways, but two.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.960
Hey guys!

17:32.960 --> 17:37.040
If you are going to switch to true north, best to get it done, like, before the poles flip?

17:37.040 --> 17:37.600
Just sayin'!
