0	2320	Hello! So you want to be a pirate, my lad?
2320	6000	Well, let me tell ye, being a pirate, be all about branding.
6000	9360	Ye are, it's a business, but branding be bringing in the booty,
9360	14000	and if ye be shipping with our jolly crew, ye need love this Jolly Roger.
14560	18880	Question. Isn't waving a pirate flag like waving a We Are Thieves flag?
18880	20560	It seems not helpful.
20560	24080	This skull and crossbones be more than just a bit of arg, look at us.
24080	26080	It's plumage prerequisite for plundering.
26080	29200	As pirates, we be wanting booty. Booty belicious.
29200	32160	But parties protect their booty, preferring it unplundered.
32160	36400	So we must plunder asunder, which tis a lot of work and risk.
36400	37280	Who needs that?
37280	38640	See, we want free booty.
38640	42000	When we ask for booty, booty to be granted and bounce.
42000	43680	But why would a ship just give up?
43680	44960	The branding!
44960	46480	Plus a surprise reveal.
46480	48880	Ye were right, we don't fly the flag for fun,
48880	53040	we fly false flags, keeping the Roger hidden for just the right moment.
53040	56160	Our ship be lean and mean, and we hide this too.
56160	58480	With prey in sight, we billow barrels behind,
58480	61280	so though our sails be full, our speed be slow,
61280	65920	and we seem fat and full with supplies kept above deck for greater effect.
65920	67200	Okay, that's pretty clever.
67200	68640	But this be my favorite.
68640	70160	A camouflaged hull.
70160	73760	Painted canvas unfurled to cover the true number of guns.
73760	76160	Behold! That looks pretty fake.
76160	78400	Yar, it need only look good from afar.
78400	83040	Ships be seen at a distance through a looking glass on the high seas.
83040	85280	Branding is image, not reality.
85280	87680	And empire and merchants do the reverse.
87680	90480	Carving and painting fake cannon to intimidate.
90480	93440	But fake guns don't shoot, now do they?
93440	97840	So we be sailing slowly along, all how do you do, fellow countrymen?
97840	99760	Then, when close enough, the reveal.
99760	104080	Cutting our cover, unfurling the flag, ditching the drag, and sullying pantaloons.
104080	105040	That's branding.
105040	107200	Do it right, and they won't fight.
107200	108160	Why, again?
108160	110240	I feel like you're not answering this question.
110240	113040	Look, think like one of those poor seamen sods yonder.
113040	116480	Imagine ye be working for the empire, minding yourself,
116480	119760	when, surprise, pirates, please present your booty.
119760	122640	Ugh, this guy's the worst.
122640	125360	Your captain can choose to fight or not.
125360	131120	But if ye fight, and if ye lose, we will torture crewmen to death while others watch.
131920	134000	Oh, that's not jolly.
134000	135680	That's not jolly at all.
135680	139520	Look, sometimes misguided men will try to hide booty.
139520	141600	And we can't have that.
141600	144400	We don't want to torture, understand.
144400	148320	I scorn to do anyone a mischief when it not for my advantage.
148320	150560	But brands must mean something.
150560	153680	And torturing over hidden treasure is quite memorable,
153680	156560	which generates effective word-of-mouth marketing.
156560	160240	At least from those who have told us the truth about hidden treasure
160240	162560	and thus get to keep their tongues.
162560	165280	Ah, so be the sailor's choice.
165280	169040	Fight, lose, maybe torture for you, maybe death for you.
169040	170640	Pirates get booty anyway.
170640	172080	What a hassle for nothing.
172080	174640	And we make it so easy to give up.
174640	178080	If your captain simply surrenders, we leave everyone alone.
178080	179760	No fighting, no torture.
179760	184160	Just a transference of booty between ships passing on the high seas.
184160	187680	On the other hand, you could fight and you might win,
187680	190400	though maybe as less of a man than before,
190400	196640	but lose and you might beg for mercy in the last and longest moments of your life.
196640	197360	Boop.
197360	201840	The flag we raise lets ye know your options before loading that cannon.
201840	205280	And we have one more surrender incentive.
205280	209280	Say the target captain calls his men to fight to protect his booty.
209280	212080	That captain is a fool and probably cruel,
212080	216160	treating his men like mule, feeding them gruel while admiring a jewel,
216160	218240	the whole crew sick of his rule.
218240	221200	When they see our flag and the captain's command,
221200	224880	the crew can mutiny, letting us aboard without resistance.
224880	228000	And as thanks for their assistance, we be holding a court.
228000	231360	A court of the captain where his crew can complain.
231360	234720	Knowing this chance corrodes a captain's confidence in command,
234720	239280	given the crew's critique of his conduct could conclude his career.
239280	241040	It's hilarious.
241040	247120	Though the Empire calls us outlaws, we also be angels of vengeance on the high seas.
247120	251520	What branding, terror and mercy and justice combined.
251520	252240	It's beautiful.
252800	254960	So that's the pirate's life.
254960	258240	Sure, the Empire's noose will dangle over your head,
258240	261280	but you'll have brothers in arms and booty in hand.
261440	262240	What say ye?
263600	266480	I'd like to talk to that guy before I decide.
