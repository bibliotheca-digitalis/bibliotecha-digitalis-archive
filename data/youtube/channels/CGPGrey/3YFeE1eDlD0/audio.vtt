00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Hello! So you want to be a pirate, my lad?

00:02.320 --> 00:06.000
Well, let me tell ye, being a pirate, be all about branding.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.360
Ye are, it's a business, but branding be bringing in the booty,

00:09.360 --> 00:14.000
and if ye be shipping with our jolly crew, ye need love this Jolly Roger.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.880
Question. Isn't waving a pirate flag like waving a We Are Thieves flag?

00:18.880 --> 00:20.560
It seems not helpful.

00:20.560 --> 00:24.080
This skull and crossbones be more than just a bit of arg, look at us.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.080
It's plumage prerequisite for plundering.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.200
As pirates, we be wanting booty. Booty belicious.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.160
But parties protect their booty, preferring it unplundered.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.400
So we must plunder asunder, which tis a lot of work and risk.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.280
Who needs that?

00:37.280 --> 00:38.640
See, we want free booty.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.000
When we ask for booty, booty to be granted and bounce.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.680
But why would a ship just give up?

00:43.680 --> 00:44.960
The branding!

00:44.960 --> 00:46.480
Plus a surprise reveal.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.880
Ye were right, we don't fly the flag for fun,

00:48.880 --> 00:53.040
we fly false flags, keeping the Roger hidden for just the right moment.

00:53.040 --> 00:56.160
Our ship be lean and mean, and we hide this too.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.480
With prey in sight, we billow barrels behind,

00:58.480 --> 01:01.280
so though our sails be full, our speed be slow,

01:01.280 --> 01:05.920
and we seem fat and full with supplies kept above deck for greater effect.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.200
Okay, that's pretty clever.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.640
But this be my favorite.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.160
A camouflaged hull.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.760
Painted canvas unfurled to cover the true number of guns.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.160
Behold! That looks pretty fake.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.400
Yar, it need only look good from afar.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.040
Ships be seen at a distance through a looking glass on the high seas.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.280
Branding is image, not reality.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.680
And empire and merchants do the reverse.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.480
Carving and painting fake cannon to intimidate.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.440
But fake guns don't shoot, now do they?

01:33.440 --> 01:37.840
So we be sailing slowly along, all how do you do, fellow countrymen?

01:37.840 --> 01:39.760
Then, when close enough, the reveal.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.080
Cutting our cover, unfurling the flag, ditching the drag, and sullying pantaloons.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.040
That's branding.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.200
Do it right, and they won't fight.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.160
Why, again?

01:48.160 --> 01:50.240
I feel like you're not answering this question.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.040
Look, think like one of those poor seamen sods yonder.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.480
Imagine ye be working for the empire, minding yourself,

01:56.480 --> 01:59.760
when, surprise, pirates, please present your booty.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.640
Ugh, this guy's the worst.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.360
Your captain can choose to fight or not.

02:05.360 --> 02:11.120
But if ye fight, and if ye lose, we will torture crewmen to death while others watch.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.000
Oh, that's not jolly.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.680
That's not jolly at all.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.520
Look, sometimes misguided men will try to hide booty.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.600
And we can't have that.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.400
We don't want to torture, understand.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.320
I scorn to do anyone a mischief when it not for my advantage.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.560
But brands must mean something.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.680
And torturing over hidden treasure is quite memorable,

02:33.680 --> 02:36.560
which generates effective word-of-mouth marketing.

02:36.560 --> 02:40.240
At least from those who have told us the truth about hidden treasure

02:40.240 --> 02:42.560
and thus get to keep their tongues.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.280
Ah, so be the sailor's choice.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.040
Fight, lose, maybe torture for you, maybe death for you.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.640
Pirates get booty anyway.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.080
What a hassle for nothing.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.640
And we make it so easy to give up.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.080
If your captain simply surrenders, we leave everyone alone.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.760
No fighting, no torture.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.160
Just a transference of booty between ships passing on the high seas.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.680
On the other hand, you could fight and you might win,

03:07.680 --> 03:10.400
though maybe as less of a man than before,

03:10.400 --> 03:16.640
but lose and you might beg for mercy in the last and longest moments of your life.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.360
Boop.

03:17.360 --> 03:21.840
The flag we raise lets ye know your options before loading that cannon.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.280
And we have one more surrender incentive.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.280
Say the target captain calls his men to fight to protect his booty.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.080
That captain is a fool and probably cruel,

03:32.080 --> 03:36.160
treating his men like mule, feeding them gruel while admiring a jewel,

03:36.160 --> 03:38.240
the whole crew sick of his rule.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.200
When they see our flag and the captain's command,

03:41.200 --> 03:44.880
the crew can mutiny, letting us aboard without resistance.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.000
And as thanks for their assistance, we be holding a court.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.360
A court of the captain where his crew can complain.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.720
Knowing this chance corrodes a captain's confidence in command,

03:54.720 --> 03:59.280
given the crew's critique of his conduct could conclude his career.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.040
It's hilarious.

04:01.040 --> 04:07.120
Though the Empire calls us outlaws, we also be angels of vengeance on the high seas.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.520
What branding, terror and mercy and justice combined.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.240
It's beautiful.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.960
So that's the pirate's life.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.240
Sure, the Empire's noose will dangle over your head,

04:18.240 --> 04:21.280
but you'll have brothers in arms and booty in hand.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.240
What say ye?

04:23.600 --> 04:26.480
I'd like to talk to that guy before I decide.
