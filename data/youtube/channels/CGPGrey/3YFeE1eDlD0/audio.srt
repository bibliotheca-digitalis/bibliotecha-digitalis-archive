00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello! So you want to be a pirate, my lad?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, let me tell ye, being a pirate, be all about branding.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Ye are, it's a business, but branding be bringing in the booty,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,000
and if ye be shipping with our jolly crew, ye need love this Jolly Roger.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,880
Question. Isn't waving a pirate flag like waving a We Are Thieves flag?

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
It seems not helpful.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
This skull and crossbones be more than just a bit of arg, look at us.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
It's plumage prerequisite for plundering.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,200
As pirates, we be wanting booty. Booty belicious.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,160
But parties protect their booty, preferring it unplundered.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,400
So we must plunder asunder, which tis a lot of work and risk.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,280
Who needs that?

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
See, we want free booty.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
When we ask for booty, booty to be granted and bounce.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
But why would a ship just give up?

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,960
The branding!

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
Plus a surprise reveal.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,880
Ye were right, we don't fly the flag for fun,

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,040
we fly false flags, keeping the Roger hidden for just the right moment.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,160
Our ship be lean and mean, and we hide this too.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
With prey in sight, we billow barrels behind,

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,280
so though our sails be full, our speed be slow,

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,920
and we seem fat and full with supplies kept above deck for greater effect.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
Okay, that's pretty clever.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
But this be my favorite.

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,160
A camouflaged hull.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,760
Painted canvas unfurled to cover the true number of guns.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,160
Behold! That looks pretty fake.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,400
Yar, it need only look good from afar.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
Ships be seen at a distance through a looking glass on the high seas.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
Branding is image, not reality.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
And empire and merchants do the reverse.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Carving and painting fake cannon to intimidate.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,440
But fake guns don't shoot, now do they?

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,840
So we be sailing slowly along, all how do you do, fellow countrymen?

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
Then, when close enough, the reveal.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,080
Cutting our cover, unfurling the flag, ditching the drag, and sullying pantaloons.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,040
That's branding.

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
Do it right, and they won't fight.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,160
Why, again?

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,240
I feel like you're not answering this question.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
Look, think like one of those poor seamen sods yonder.

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Imagine ye be working for the empire, minding yourself,

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,760
when, surprise, pirates, please present your booty.

45
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,640
Ugh, this guy's the worst.

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
Your captain can choose to fight or not.

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,120
But if ye fight, and if ye lose, we will torture crewmen to death while others watch.

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, that's not jolly.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
That's not jolly at all.

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Look, sometimes misguided men will try to hide booty.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,600
And we can't have that.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
We don't want to torture, understand.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,320
I scorn to do anyone a mischief when it not for my advantage.

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,560
But brands must mean something.

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
And torturing over hidden treasure is quite memorable,

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,560
which generates effective word-of-mouth marketing.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,240
At least from those who have told us the truth about hidden treasure

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,560
and thus get to keep their tongues.

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
Ah, so be the sailor's choice.

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Fight, lose, maybe torture for you, maybe death for you.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Pirates get booty anyway.

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
What a hassle for nothing.

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,640
And we make it so easy to give up.

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,080
If your captain simply surrenders, we leave everyone alone.

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
No fighting, no torture.

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,160
Just a transference of booty between ships passing on the high seas.

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,680
On the other hand, you could fight and you might win,

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
though maybe as less of a man than before,

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,640
but lose and you might beg for mercy in the last and longest moments of your life.

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,360
Boop.

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
The flag we raise lets ye know your options before loading that cannon.

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
And we have one more surrender incentive.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Say the target captain calls his men to fight to protect his booty.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,080
That captain is a fool and probably cruel,

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,160
treating his men like mule, feeding them gruel while admiring a jewel,

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,240
the whole crew sick of his rule.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,200
When they see our flag and the captain's command,

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,880
the crew can mutiny, letting us aboard without resistance.

79
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,000
And as thanks for their assistance, we be holding a court.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
A court of the captain where his crew can complain.

81
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
Knowing this chance corrodes a captain's confidence in command,

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
given the crew's critique of his conduct could conclude his career.

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
It's hilarious.

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,120
Though the Empire calls us outlaws, we also be angels of vengeance on the high seas.

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,520
What branding, terror and mercy and justice combined.

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,240
It's beautiful.

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,960
So that's the pirate's life.

88
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,240
Sure, the Empire's noose will dangle over your head,

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,280
but you'll have brothers in arms and booty in hand.

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
What say ye?

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,480
I'd like to talk to that guy before I decide.
