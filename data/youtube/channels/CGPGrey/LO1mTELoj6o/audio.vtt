00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Happiness. Many will advise you how to obtain it, but maybe you're not trying to be happy.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.680
Your actions aim for the opposite.

00:07.680 --> 00:12.160
You want to be the saddest saddo sailing on the sea of sadness.

00:12.160 --> 00:18.480
Much easier to achieve, and this video has seven tactics to get you started toward the dark currents,

00:18.480 --> 00:20.960
at least one of which you are already doing.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.080
So let's begin.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.680
First, stay still.

00:23.680 --> 00:28.000
Remain indoors as much as possible, preferably in the same room.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.120
Be the human equivalent of a pile of laundry.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.720
Inert, unmoving.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.200
Don't let a beautiful day tempt you for a walk.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.840
Avoid anything even vaguely exorcisial.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.040
This keeps reward chemicals out of your brain which could divert you,

00:41.040 --> 00:45.840
and stillness guides you towards medical problems which will keep this wheel turning.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.200
Stillness is the most effective thing you can do.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.200
So be the laundry pile.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.360
Make your bedroom your all room.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.360
Live and work and play and sleep in the smallest radius you can.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.400
Which brings us to screw with your sleep.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.320
The wraith of insomnia will be your copilot on the sea of sadness.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.520
Her mere presence is unpleasant, but she also helps confuse the productive part of your brain

01:09.520 --> 01:13.760
which might look to navigate you toward the islands of happiness on the horizon.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.720
More on that later.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.680
A regular sleep cycle is a fragile thing and takes at least three days to establish.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.320
Be sure then to vary your bedtime by several hours, twice a week at least.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.320
Even better, vary your wake times.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.640
Sleep in late, preferably very late, some but not all days.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.480
Tell yourself you are making up for sleep to feel like you're doing something healthy,

01:34.480 --> 01:38.720
even though you feel terrible when you wake up early and when you wake up late.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.080
Irregular sleep is another of the sea's accelerating currents.

01:42.080 --> 01:47.040
The more you vary your sleep, the harder regular sleep becomes which makes your sleep more variable.

01:47.040 --> 01:51.120
To never sleep or wake at the same time naturally is the goal.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.240
And to help in this, maximize your screen time.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.680
Staying on screen complements the previous sailing tactics.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.960
Boredom could drive you to motion, so let the screen entertain you.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.720
Tiredness can push you to sleep, so let the screen keep you awake.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.360
Sort of.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.720
As long as possible.

02:06.720 --> 02:12.080
Always fall asleep with a screen in your hand and put your eyes back on it as soon as you wake.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.840
Every moment away from a screen is a moment you might notice the horizon.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.640
Keep your head down and let the currents pull you.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.800
Here you have allies unknown.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.160
Behind the screen are teams of the smartest people and brightest bots

02:24.160 --> 02:27.920
competing to hold your attention on them as long as possible.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.920
Let them reach you to pull you back if you turn away.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.440
Plus, screens help with

02:34.400 --> 02:37.680
Use your screen to stoke your negative emotions,

02:37.680 --> 02:42.960
to feed your anger or anxiety about things over which you have no control or influence.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.200
Be well informed while doing nothing.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.720
The things you care about could be navigational guides out of the sea,

02:48.720 --> 02:53.120
reasons to leave your all room and take meaningful action with the humans around you.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.840
But you can instead use the things you care about as further sources of misery.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.360
Focus on the bad to fuel your resentment or despair.

03:01.360 --> 03:05.280
If you must contribute, do so only in meaningless token ways

03:05.280 --> 03:08.080
and be disappointed in the lack of change.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.080
We're coming towards the end and if you're doing it right, misery is descending.

03:12.080 --> 03:17.600
But some part of your brain is rebelling, trying to turn the ship by setting a goal.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.640
If you're not careful, that part of your brain just might save you.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.440
But luckily we can do more than just hobble it.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.640
We can fool it to navigate deeper into the sea.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.600
To reach goals, they must be specific, measurable,

03:29.600 --> 03:33.040
actionable for which you are responsible and time bounded.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.160
I will turn the wheel one degree right now.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.360
Instead, set the productive part of your brain on vapid goals.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.640
Vague, amorphous, pie in the sky, irrelevant, delayed.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.920
Make the target unclear and the path unclear.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.400
If motivation strikes, aim ridiculously high to guarantee failure.

03:50.400 --> 03:55.600
I will clean the whole house today is much better than I will do the laundry in this pile.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.520
Cleaning a whole house is impossible.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.800
There's always more to do, so you will always fail.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.680
Focus on goals that are after what you wish to achieve.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.800
Learn how to market an app before you learn to code.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.160
This will distract the productive part of your brain quite nicely.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.080
And be sure to wait for motivation rather than setting a time.

04:14.080 --> 04:19.440
You'll do something when you feel like it, which will be never or never enough to matter.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.600
With vapid goals, you will turn the productive part of your brain from a dangerous source of

04:23.600 --> 04:28.880
self-improvement that rewards every small step into a consistent nag that berates you for

04:28.880 --> 04:32.720
your failure to have already accomplished your goal every step of the way.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.480
Now the vapid goals you've set should distract the productive part of your brain,

04:36.480 --> 04:42.160
but if it still fights against you, direct it towards the mirage on the sea of sadness,

04:42.160 --> 04:44.960
the islands of happiness themselves.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.520
Pursue happiness directly.

04:47.520 --> 04:53.200
The human mind is such that by setting sail towards happiness, you will achieve the opposite.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.520
Imagine happiness as a place where happy people are happy all the time.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.560
This turns happiness into an unreachable feeling of constant bliss that no one has.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.840
True happiness is like a bird that might land on your ship,

05:05.840 --> 05:09.440
but never if you constantly stand guard to catch it.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.720
Instead, improve your ship and sail into warmer waters.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.120
The bird will land when you aren't looking.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.360
So be sure never to do that.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.720
Aim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon which you sail.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.760
Last, but most important, follow your instincts.

05:25.760 --> 05:30.880
Navigation deeper into the sea of sadness is quite easy for there is a dark magnetic

05:30.880 --> 05:35.840
field that points the compass of your impulses in the right direction once you get started.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.680
You will want to stay indoors.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.840
You will want to not exercise.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.440
You will want to sleep in.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.400
You will want to do what you know will make you sadder after you've done it.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.320
Your compass points the way, both in and out.

05:50.320 --> 05:57.040
So follow the true north of your impulses and stay away from that other pole of the long term.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.400
It's all so simple.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.640
Just get started with these tactics and let the sea carry you along.
