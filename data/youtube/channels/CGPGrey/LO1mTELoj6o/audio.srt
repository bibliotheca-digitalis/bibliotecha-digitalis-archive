1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Happiness. Many will advise you how to obtain it, but maybe you're not trying to be happy.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,680
Your actions aim for the opposite.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,160
You want to be the saddest saddo sailing on the sea of sadness.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,480
Much easier to achieve, and this video has seven tactics to get you started toward the dark currents,

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
at least one of which you are already doing.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,080
So let's begin.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
First, stay still.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
Remain indoors as much as possible, preferably in the same room.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,120
Be the human equivalent of a pile of laundry.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,720
Inert, unmoving.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,200
Don't let a beautiful day tempt you for a walk.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
Avoid anything even vaguely exorcisial.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
This keeps reward chemicals out of your brain which could divert you,

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,840
and stillness guides you towards medical problems which will keep this wheel turning.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
Stillness is the most effective thing you can do.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
So be the laundry pile.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,360
Make your bedroom your all room.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Live and work and play and sleep in the smallest radius you can.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,400
Which brings us to screw with your sleep.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,320
The wraith of insomnia will be your copilot on the sea of sadness.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,520
Her mere presence is unpleasant, but she also helps confuse the productive part of your brain

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,760
which might look to navigate you toward the islands of happiness on the horizon.

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,720
More on that later.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,680
A regular sleep cycle is a fragile thing and takes at least three days to establish.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,320
Be sure then to vary your bedtime by several hours, twice a week at least.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
Even better, vary your wake times.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,640
Sleep in late, preferably very late, some but not all days.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,480
Tell yourself you are making up for sleep to feel like you're doing something healthy,

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,720
even though you feel terrible when you wake up early and when you wake up late.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,080
Irregular sleep is another of the sea's accelerating currents.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,040
The more you vary your sleep, the harder regular sleep becomes which makes your sleep more variable.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,120
To never sleep or wake at the same time naturally is the goal.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,240
And to help in this, maximize your screen time.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,680
Staying on screen complements the previous sailing tactics.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
Boredom could drive you to motion, so let the screen entertain you.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,720
Tiredness can push you to sleep, so let the screen keep you awake.

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,360
Sort of.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,720
As long as possible.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,080
Always fall asleep with a screen in your hand and put your eyes back on it as soon as you wake.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Every moment away from a screen is a moment you might notice the horizon.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Keep your head down and let the currents pull you.

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
Here you have allies unknown.

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,160
Behind the screen are teams of the smartest people and brightest bots

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
competing to hold your attention on them as long as possible.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Let them reach you to pull you back if you turn away.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,440
Plus, screens help with

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
Use your screen to stoke your negative emotions,

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,960
to feed your anger or anxiety about things over which you have no control or influence.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Be well informed while doing nothing.

50
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
The things you care about could be navigational guides out of the sea,

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
reasons to leave your all room and take meaningful action with the humans around you.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,840
But you can instead use the things you care about as further sources of misery.

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
Focus on the bad to fuel your resentment or despair.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,280
If you must contribute, do so only in meaningless token ways

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
and be disappointed in the lack of change.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
We're coming towards the end and if you're doing it right, misery is descending.

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,600
But some part of your brain is rebelling, trying to turn the ship by setting a goal.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,640
If you're not careful, that part of your brain just might save you.

59
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
But luckily we can do more than just hobble it.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,640
We can fool it to navigate deeper into the sea.

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,600
To reach goals, they must be specific, measurable,

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,040
actionable for which you are responsible and time bounded.

63
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,160
I will turn the wheel one degree right now.

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,360
Instead, set the productive part of your brain on vapid goals.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
Vague, amorphous, pie in the sky, irrelevant, delayed.

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
Make the target unclear and the path unclear.

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,400
If motivation strikes, aim ridiculously high to guarantee failure.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,600
I will clean the whole house today is much better than I will do the laundry in this pile.

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,520
Cleaning a whole house is impossible.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,800
There's always more to do, so you will always fail.

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,680
Focus on goals that are after what you wish to achieve.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,800
Learn how to market an app before you learn to code.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,160
This will distract the productive part of your brain quite nicely.

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,080
And be sure to wait for motivation rather than setting a time.

75
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,440
You'll do something when you feel like it, which will be never or never enough to matter.

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
With vapid goals, you will turn the productive part of your brain from a dangerous source of

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,880
self-improvement that rewards every small step into a consistent nag that berates you for

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,720
your failure to have already accomplished your goal every step of the way.

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,480
Now the vapid goals you've set should distract the productive part of your brain,

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,160
but if it still fights against you, direct it towards the mirage on the sea of sadness,

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
the islands of happiness themselves.

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
Pursue happiness directly.

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,200
The human mind is such that by setting sail towards happiness, you will achieve the opposite.

84
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,520
Imagine happiness as a place where happy people are happy all the time.

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,560
This turns happiness into an unreachable feeling of constant bliss that no one has.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
True happiness is like a bird that might land on your ship,

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
but never if you constantly stand guard to catch it.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,720
Instead, improve your ship and sail into warmer waters.

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
The bird will land when you aren't looking.

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
So be sure never to do that.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,720
Aim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon which you sail.

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Last, but most important, follow your instincts.

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,880
Navigation deeper into the sea of sadness is quite easy for there is a dark magnetic

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,840
field that points the compass of your impulses in the right direction once you get started.

95
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
You will want to stay indoors.

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
You will want to not exercise.

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
You will want to sleep in.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
You will want to do what you know will make you sadder after you've done it.

99
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,320
Your compass points the way, both in and out.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,040
So follow the true north of your impulses and stay away from that other pole of the long term.

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,400
It's all so simple.

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,640
Just get started with these tactics and let the sea carry you along.
