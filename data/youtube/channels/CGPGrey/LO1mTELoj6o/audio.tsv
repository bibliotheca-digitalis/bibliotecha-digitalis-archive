0	5200	Happiness. Many will advise you how to obtain it, but maybe you're not trying to be happy.
5200	7680	Your actions aim for the opposite.
7680	12160	You want to be the saddest saddo sailing on the sea of sadness.
12160	18480	Much easier to achieve, and this video has seven tactics to get you started toward the dark currents,
18480	20960	at least one of which you are already doing.
20960	22080	So let's begin.
22080	23680	First, stay still.
23680	28000	Remain indoors as much as possible, preferably in the same room.
28000	31120	Be the human equivalent of a pile of laundry.
31120	32720	Inert, unmoving.
32720	35200	Don't let a beautiful day tempt you for a walk.
35200	37840	Avoid anything even vaguely exorcisial.
37840	41040	This keeps reward chemicals out of your brain which could divert you,
41040	45840	and stillness guides you towards medical problems which will keep this wheel turning.
45840	49200	Stillness is the most effective thing you can do.
49200	51200	So be the laundry pile.
51200	53360	Make your bedroom your all room.
53360	57360	Live and work and play and sleep in the smallest radius you can.
57440	60400	Which brings us to screw with your sleep.
60400	64320	The wraith of insomnia will be your copilot on the sea of sadness.
64320	69520	Her mere presence is unpleasant, but she also helps confuse the productive part of your brain
69520	73760	which might look to navigate you toward the islands of happiness on the horizon.
73760	74720	More on that later.
74720	79680	A regular sleep cycle is a fragile thing and takes at least three days to establish.
79680	84320	Be sure then to vary your bedtime by several hours, twice a week at least.
84400	86320	Even better, vary your wake times.
86320	90640	Sleep in late, preferably very late, some but not all days.
90640	94480	Tell yourself you are making up for sleep to feel like you're doing something healthy,
94480	98720	even though you feel terrible when you wake up early and when you wake up late.
98720	102080	Irregular sleep is another of the sea's accelerating currents.
102080	107040	The more you vary your sleep, the harder regular sleep becomes which makes your sleep more variable.
107040	111120	To never sleep or wake at the same time naturally is the goal.
111120	114240	And to help in this, maximize your screen time.
114320	117680	Staying on screen complements the previous sailing tactics.
117680	120960	Boredom could drive you to motion, so let the screen entertain you.
120960	124720	Tiredness can push you to sleep, so let the screen keep you awake.
124720	125360	Sort of.
125360	126720	As long as possible.
126720	132080	Always fall asleep with a screen in your hand and put your eyes back on it as soon as you wake.
132080	135840	Every moment away from a screen is a moment you might notice the horizon.
135840	138640	Keep your head down and let the currents pull you.
138640	140800	Here you have allies unknown.
140880	144160	Behind the screen are teams of the smartest people and brightest bots
144160	147920	competing to hold your attention on them as long as possible.
147920	151920	Let them reach you to pull you back if you turn away.
151920	153440	Plus, screens help with
154400	157680	Use your screen to stoke your negative emotions,
157680	162960	to feed your anger or anxiety about things over which you have no control or influence.
162960	165200	Be well informed while doing nothing.
165200	168720	The things you care about could be navigational guides out of the sea,
168720	173120	reasons to leave your all room and take meaningful action with the humans around you.
173120	177840	But you can instead use the things you care about as further sources of misery.
177840	181360	Focus on the bad to fuel your resentment or despair.
181360	185280	If you must contribute, do so only in meaningless token ways
185280	188080	and be disappointed in the lack of change.
188080	192080	We're coming towards the end and if you're doing it right, misery is descending.
192080	197600	But some part of your brain is rebelling, trying to turn the ship by setting a goal.
197600	200640	If you're not careful, that part of your brain just might save you.
200640	203440	But luckily we can do more than just hobble it.
203440	206640	We can fool it to navigate deeper into the sea.
206640	209600	To reach goals, they must be specific, measurable,
209600	213040	actionable for which you are responsible and time bounded.
213040	216160	I will turn the wheel one degree right now.
216160	219360	Instead, set the productive part of your brain on vapid goals.
219360	222640	Vague, amorphous, pie in the sky, irrelevant, delayed.
222640	225920	Make the target unclear and the path unclear.
225920	230400	If motivation strikes, aim ridiculously high to guarantee failure.
230400	235600	I will clean the whole house today is much better than I will do the laundry in this pile.
235600	237520	Cleaning a whole house is impossible.
237520	240800	There's always more to do, so you will always fail.
240800	243680	Focus on goals that are after what you wish to achieve.
243680	246800	Learn how to market an app before you learn to code.
246800	250160	This will distract the productive part of your brain quite nicely.
250160	254080	And be sure to wait for motivation rather than setting a time.
254080	259440	You'll do something when you feel like it, which will be never or never enough to matter.
259440	263600	With vapid goals, you will turn the productive part of your brain from a dangerous source of
263600	268880	self-improvement that rewards every small step into a consistent nag that berates you for
268880	272720	your failure to have already accomplished your goal every step of the way.
272720	276480	Now the vapid goals you've set should distract the productive part of your brain,
276480	282160	but if it still fights against you, direct it towards the mirage on the sea of sadness,
282160	284960	the islands of happiness themselves.
284960	287520	Pursue happiness directly.
287520	293200	The human mind is such that by setting sail towards happiness, you will achieve the opposite.
293200	297520	Imagine happiness as a place where happy people are happy all the time.
297520	302560	This turns happiness into an unreachable feeling of constant bliss that no one has.
302560	305840	True happiness is like a bird that might land on your ship,
305840	309440	but never if you constantly stand guard to catch it.
309440	312720	Instead, improve your ship and sail into warmer waters.
312720	315120	The bird will land when you aren't looking.
315920	317360	So be sure never to do that.
317360	322720	Aim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon which you sail.
322720	325760	Last, but most important, follow your instincts.
325760	330880	Navigation deeper into the sea of sadness is quite easy for there is a dark magnetic
330880	335840	field that points the compass of your impulses in the right direction once you get started.
335840	337680	You will want to stay indoors.
337680	339840	You will want to not exercise.
339840	341440	You will want to sleep in.
341440	346400	You will want to do what you know will make you sadder after you've done it.
346400	350320	Your compass points the way, both in and out.
350320	357040	So follow the true north of your impulses and stay away from that other pole of the long term.
357040	358400	It's all so simple.
358400	362640	Just get started with these tactics and let the sea carry you along.
