0	10720	Okay, yeah, it is a bit late for coffee in the UK, but upload days now with the addition
10720	14680	of director's commentary days are very long days.
14680	20880	So I'm quite tired by the end of it, but I feel like the right way to do this is to do
20880	23480	the director's commentary on the same day of upload.
23480	26120	If I don't do the director's commentary on the same day, then I know what's going to
26120	30720	happen, which is I'm going to start really preparing for it and then I'm going to turn
30720	34880	it into a whole other job and then it will never happen.
34880	41260	So this is why it's like director's commentary right away, whatever I happen to remember
41260	42520	or nothing.
42520	44240	So that's the way it's going to work.
44240	48960	This is a video that I really didn't expect I was going to do a director's commentary
48960	55680	for because I mean, obviously this is only the fourth one, so I'm still kind of figuring
55680	65560	this out, but for the Grey Goes Outside playlist things that I've been working on, these already
65560	70640	feel a little bit like they're behind the scenes videos anyway, so it's a bit odd to
70640	78280	do a director's commentary for them and I think they're just a lot less dense and intense
78280	82500	than the main CGP Grey animated stuff.
82500	88680	So I think in general, if I'm doing stuff like this in the future, there probably won't
88680	97900	be a director's commentary, but this Ticoi project, boy, did it turn out to be a whole
97900	98900	thing.
98900	104620	So I figure there's at least a little mini director's commentary in this one.
104620	108020	Would you classify this video as one of your light grey videos?
108020	109020	No.
109020	114740	I created on the channel this playlist in a category that I'm calling light grey.
114740	123420	That is for stuff that is really easy and is relatively unedited and unresearched.
123420	127860	So like the little video that I put up before this of just me driving the Tesla straight
127860	132140	into a bunch of tumbleweed that was like a cut scene, that's like a light grey video.
132140	137520	I think that sort of video can be kind of fun, but it's obviously not a main video or
137520	143160	like I did the explanation of the Supreme Court recently and for various reasons, like
143160	146560	that's a video that I could make without having to do a ton of research.
146560	149280	It doesn't need to be as tightly edited.
149280	152640	And so yeah, that's like a different category.
152640	159080	You know what this is, I'm putting this under my playlist of like grey goes outside, which
159080	166200	really I could not have timed worse as a project I was really planning on doubling down this
166200	169800	year on with the global pandemic.
169800	173400	So this is obviously a project that's a little bit left over for that.
173400	178600	But yeah, I had a whole bunch of things in mind for like grey goes outside as a concept
178600	182600	and the world had other ideas.
182600	188120	So that's the category this fits into and who knows how much stuff will appear on that
188120	189420	at any point in the future.
189420	193080	But that's the answer to your question of what do I consider this?
193080	196040	I consider this a grey goes outside video.
196040	197480	It's not a main video.
197480	199360	It's not a light grey video.
199360	202800	It's me being outside and exploring a place.
202800	204520	Yeah, the harbor master.
204520	209200	I could make a vlog taking out the trash and that is just about the most exciting outdoor
209200	211360	thing that I have done in several months.
211360	214280	So I hope everyone's doing all right.
214280	219480	So to give you a sense of this, I was talking to my assistant this morning and we were just
219480	221520	trying to trace back.
221520	224600	How long have we been working on this thing?
224600	232240	Because from our subjective experience, it feels like we have been working on Tico for
232240	234200	forever.
234200	239780	And the answer was the first correspondence between the two of us about this project goes
239780	242900	to May of last year.
242900	250100	That is more than a year ago when I first decided to bring someone in on this project
250100	256420	and then I don't know exactly how long before that I was working on this and sort of investigating
256420	258660	it as a possible thing.
258660	266220	But so yeah, May of last year is when this became like a real this looks like it's going
266220	269620	to happen project.
269620	271780	Still not as old as the Catan video.
271780	278000	Well, yes, I mean technically that's correct, but the Catan video is not actively being
278000	284080	worked on the Ticoi project was actively worked on for the past year and a bunch of different
284080	285360	ways.
285360	291600	But yeah, so it's just a very very long time ago and the way that this worked.
291600	301160	I was going to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation for other reasons at that time and it just
301160	307540	so happened that I came across this what I thought was just an incidental piece of
307540	315860	information that oh the on this reservation there happens to be this I didn't even know
315860	322360	what it was exactly like old weapons facility or something like I it was extremely hard
322360	330140	to figure out at the time but I could see that they like had this place as or like this
330140	336520	facility existed on the reservation is the best way to put it in the process of going
336520	341000	out to Skull Valley and going to the reservation.
341000	348380	I was able to get permission from the tribe to be able to go on to go on to Ticoi.
348380	350380	That's how this happens.
350380	357960	This is not a facility that you can just go visit like if anybody is out in the area like
357960	363920	don't drive down to Ticoi and just think you're going to see something you cannot go
363920	365380	on there.
365380	368740	They're not joking when they say that the area is patrolled.
368740	375980	It is also super dangerous like if people don't know that you're there it's not a it's
375980	384420	not a good place like it is an abandoned old facility and given that there's a lot of underground
384420	391040	construction and a lot of this stuff are huge metal doors and all the rest of it like
391040	395900	it's not a place to just go wandering on your own like that's a bad idea if people don't
395900	397320	know that you're there.
397320	402240	It's sort of funny as a creator because when I made the first video where I showed me just
402240	408600	exploring Ticoi I thought that would be kind of clear when I showed people the opening
408600	415780	scene is oh I'm unlocking the gates with this key and I figured like this is a clear
415780	420100	enough indication that I have permission to be here and this is not a place that you should
420100	426600	go there's a there's a lock and I am unlocking it and then at the end you know I'm closing
426600	432940	it back up but boy did I get a lot of comments from people about how did you go there like
432940	437040	people wanting to visit it themselves.
437040	441420	So yeah I guess I guess I was a little bit wrong about how clear that message is of unlocking
441420	447040	the gate but yeah so I just just want to say like it's not a public place that that a person
447040	454020	can go visit I was able to get permission from the tribal leaders and I had to sign
454020	459500	a lot of waivers in order to be able to go there so that's the that's the behind the
459500	465100	scenes of of how did this actually come to happen.
465100	469480	Really getting this secluded office space that you want I actually had I actually had
469480	474680	a little line that I cut from the exploration video where there was a bunker that was way
474680	479080	off to the side of the facility that I thought oh this actually would be a really charming
479080	483120	writing space if I could just get some air conditioning down there like I would really
483120	489160	love this as an office that didn't make it into the the original exploration video.
489160	492300	Oh one more thing before I before I could hear one more thing about the exploration
492300	497760	video before I forget the other really minor thing which I just just want to make clear
497760	505600	and I wish I had thought to put it in the original video but I did not take the badge
505600	510520	that I lift off of the rack in the opening of the exploration video like that that was
510520	516860	a little bit of oh let me show you the badge and the idea was that oh like oh I need this
516860	522120	to be here right this is the badge for being a tikoy you don't go to a unique historical
522120	527620	site and just take yourself a bunch of souvenirs that you're never going to look at but I was
527620	531040	pretty surprised by how many people are like oh I've got to take one of those badges it's
531040	536580	like no no no no no that's not what these places are you know you leave them for the
536580	542400	next people who are going to be there or you leave them to be reconstructed and restored
542400	546260	in the future but yeah so that's one thing it didn't occur to me at the time that I needed
546260	552040	to film putting the badge back on the rack but I just I just didn't think about it and
552040	556220	yeah that was an interesting piece of feedback from people would I ever go to Chernobyl it's
556220	562340	an interesting question probably not I don't know what the background radiation is for
562340	569420	that place now like how dangerous that is compared to other things but I think my gut
569420	576420	reaction is Chernobyl to me is not interesting enough that I would want to increase my risk
576420	581620	of getting cancer by visiting it even if it's a relatively small amount okay were there
581620	585640	classified things Revolution Dudes is asking were there classified things you couldn't
585640	592420	show on camera so as best I could tell here's some paperwork everything that was left there
592420	598100	was not classified documents now of course I didn't read through every piece of paper
598100	603900	that was there but there was lots of stuff that had obviously been removed there was
603900	609580	nothing on site that was classified but this project was weird because it kept running
609580	615260	up against the I'll say it this way like the edges of classified things but maybe we can
615260	618860	maybe we can get to that a little bit later okay all right let me actually start this
618860	623140	thing is my theory is that I want to do a relatively short one of these just to prove
623140	630300	to myself that I can this is the ticoi test range or at least it once was the site is
630300	636100	long abandoned now but it once served a vital purpose oh okay I don't know okay this is
636100	638980	this is one of these things where as a creator you're really pleased with something but I
638980	646420	don't know if anybody notices or cares I spent a million years on this okay so this is footage
646420	653820	of footage of me on the facility and then I do this little just little fade transitions
653820	663940	look guys look we're going we're going back in time back in time to the 1980s and this
663940	672980	is footage from ticoi when it was in operation now I don't know okay I need to be here's
672980	680620	the thing I need to be a little bit careful about the way I say things because for this
680620	690100	project it was necessary to have like legal consultation for some parts of it and prior
690100	697340	to this video existing as far as me and my assistant were able to determine there was
697340	705380	absolutely no public footage available of ticoi in operation at the time like no video
705380	715400	no photographs but this piece of footage was acquired and is the debut of anyone being
715400	721860	able to see what the facility looked like when it was an operation and just by total
721860	729900	dumb luck I happen to film myself in one spot where whoever the camera operator was
729900	736500	what I what I think what I suspect happens is the camera was just misaligned it happened
736500	742220	to be pointing at the bunker and then the camera operator guy you know real real aligned
742220	746900	the camera to where it's supposed to be and started to zoom in on on one of the tests
746900	753900	so I feel like this is just a lucky accident from 30 years ago and a lucky accident from
753900	759260	me a year and a half ago filming this thing that I was able to able to transition back
759260	764180	and forth so I'm telling you all about this because I spent forever on it and I was really
764180	773380	I was really determined I'm like I am going to fit this transition in the video somewhere
773380	782420	if it kills me so there we go served a vital purpose a military purpose and the work done
782420	788620	at ticoi is still out in the world today constructed during the cold war at the entrance to the
788620	796820	facility is a warning sign in Russian so everybody asks what does the sign in Russian say and
796820	802580	what I've what I've been delighted by is some people in the exploration video went through
802580	807740	all of the trouble of trying to translate the sign like typing it into Google or using
807740	813100	like translation software on a screenshot or something what the sign in Russian says
813100	819860	is what this sign in English says right next to it this they are the same sign and it's
819860	825460	like the list of prohibited items that are not allowed on the site you know so hey you're
825460	832340	coming on to a missile motor test site please don't bring matches cigarette lighters other
832340	840140	flame producing devices firearms ammunition drugs and intoxicants like those are the things
840140	848660	that you cannot bring on to a missile motor test site don't do that that's really bad
848660	853700	Russian but this is not the former Soviet Union this is the great state of Utah where
853700	860540	in skull intoxicants not allowed for Russians oh yeah I mean guys yes I know it says please
860540	864500	no cameras but it's not an operation anymore so it's okay I can bring the camera there
864500	870540	like I had permission it's all it's all totally fine so here's a map of Utah the geography
870540	879060	is that there are like four mountain ranges that cause three valleys and the easternmost
879060	883460	valley is where Salt Lake City is that's where like all the people live there's a valley
883460	891300	in the middle which is much less populated than the westernmost valley is is skull valley
891300	897820	which just has a tremendously awesome name and to the west here is the great Salt Lake
897820	906900	desert enormous and terrifying and yeah just an absolutely deadly deadly region skull valley
906900	917100	is extremely depopulated I think the reservation population is I mean I'd have to double check
917100	923720	the numbers but I want to say it can't be more than 40 or 50 people at most who are
923720	930820	living on the living on the reservation so it's it's a pretty it's pretty isolated area
930820	939620	but directly to the west the Salt Valley is used for a lot of weapons testing so any anyone
939620	946740	in Utah probably knows like this is the UTTR which is the Utah Utah test and training range
946740	952820	aircraft and bombs and other weapons are tested out there and I mean if the Salt Lake desert
952820	957620	is beautiful but it's also like if you got to pick a place in the continental United
957620	963780	States where you're going to test some weapons and nobody's going to notice or care it's probably
963780	971940	not a bad spot but it does it does leave skull valley like the first area where there is some
971940	977500	population right up against this and I think that's part of the reason why the ticoi test
977500	983660	facility was was put where it was because the missiles themselves are manufactured closer
983660	989500	to Salt Lake City but then skull valley is like within convenient striking distance of other
989500	994740	military other military facilities on the Great Salt Lake so just sort of was like a little spot
994740	1000500	in the middle Lee ticoi resides much of what happened on site was classified and equipment
1000500	1006140	and documents were removed but what remains is enough to piece together the story of ticoi the
1006140	1011740	paperwork left behind bears the logo of Hercules incorporated Hercules got its start in the late
1011740	1017540	1800s with a patent improving on dynamite to the creator named Hercules powder and began
1017540	1023420	manufacturing the new explosive just outside of San Francisco in a company town that would outlive
1023420	1028180	the company Hercules California one of the difficult things in trying to put together
1028180	1035440	these videos is is trying to figure out what do you include what do you not include and a lot of
1035440	1041660	this Hercules stuff was really killing me so the video should be about ticoi right like I've put
1041660	1046700	up a video that it that shows the exploration of this place and now I should put up a video
1046700	1052900	that is the explanation of the place but I did get a little bit derailed by Hercules because in
1052900	1058140	order to try to figure out okay like what was this place the first thing that you need to figure out
1058140	1065540	is okay well who ran it and the answer is this this company called Hercules but just just like
1065540	1071140	with ticoi there was not a lot of information about Hercules that was public on the internet
1071140	1080380	but was able to trace it back to this patent that we pulled from the patent office website
1080380	1087460	that started off like this company now there's there's a line here where I'm sort of glossing
1087460	1092500	over some of the details right where what do I say it's with a patent improving on it's got
1092500	1099020	it start in the late 1800 right so yeah so I say like Hercules got its start in the late 1800s I
1099020	1106740	tried not to dig into the details too much but it seems like this guy Joseph Willard he patented
1106740	1113220	Hercules powder it's this improvement on dynamite but he was working for DuPont at the time and
1113220	1120780	something happened within the company where eventually the United States government as part
1120780	1128220	of like trust busting and monopoly busting decided like DuPont was too big of a monopoly
1128220	1136980	on chemical productions and so I don't say that the company was like founded in the late 1800s
1136980	1142740	just that it got its start but the the United States government apparently came in and said
1142740	1147740	like DuPont you're too much of a monopoly we're gonna split you we're gonna split you into several
1147740	1154380	other companies and like DuPont obviously went on and became its own thing but Hercules became
1154420	1161020	a separate company and this patents for this particular kind of explosives was like the
1161020	1166860	foundation of what the business was in terms of intellectual property like okay you Hercules you
1166860	1173100	own this new explosive that's what you get DuPont you don't get this explosive you have to go make
1173100	1179780	baby powder and other things and I'd never heard of Hercules but it turns out that like from
1179780	1188900	starting as this you know making making better dynamite for farmers seemed like the primary use
1188900	1197940	in the late 1800s they exploded to become just an absolutely ginormous company and I kept having to
1197940	1203980	cut stuff about Hercules from the video because it really isn't about them but it blew my mind how
1203980	1211980	huge they were like they had dozens and dozens of production sites all over the US manufacturing
1211980	1216900	gunpowder and then later manufacturing intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles
1216900	1224540	it's just unreal they were involved in like every aspect of chemical production they did
1224540	1235100	petroleum they did turpentine like it's crazy how much they actually created and better better
1235100	1240580	dynamite for farmers to deal with the tumbleweeds yes I'm sure well we'll get we'll get to it in the
1240580	1244540	end but so anyway I spent forever like just trying to research this company be like what's the deal
1244540	1253180	and at one point I found what I thought like oh this is this is gonna be this is gonna be my
1253180	1258740	salvation this is now I'm gonna get all the answers that I want and my research is over so
1258740	1268140	let me let me find for you a little video to show you this is my desk here in my office so back when
1268140	1273060	the video had way more about Hercules than any normal person would care I thought I was going
1273060	1279100	to mention like the story of discovering this book but I ended up not doing that because nobody cares
1279100	1290180	but so this is as as far as I can tell this is like the canonical and maybe only book that exists
1290180	1297380	about the history of Hercules incorporated and it's huge it's and it's written by two guys who
1297380	1302820	it seems like this is what they do they like they just pick companies and go through and and write
1302820	1308620	these really detailed histories about it and so when I found this book I was just I was really
1308660	1316500	pumped and like yes I'm going to have all of the answers that I could ever possibly want and while
1316500	1323340	I read it and they did have a lot of interesting things about Hercules Ticoi is not even mentioned
1323340	1331460	in the book not once like it's not in the index it never ever appears anywhere in this book because
1331460	1338700	the company was so huge that Ticoi was just like an incidental little like nothing piece
1338700	1344300	of information compared to everything else that they were involved in I originally kind of thought
1344300	1349820	that would be a fun thing to mention like Oh Ticoi was so huge that the definitive book about the
1349820	1357260	company doesn't even mention Ticoi but it just like it just didn't work and then it also causes
1357260	1364380	like it's a little bit weird to cut away to my desk and and like later me showing you a book
1364380	1371900	it wasn't the point of that so I'm kind of showing you in the director's commentary but it was Gumbo
1371900	1378220	is asking how dry is the book like college textbook I guess I would I guess I would say
1378220	1385980	that you probably would want a reason to read the book would be the way I might want to phrase that
1385980	1393380	there are things that are like interesting if you've spent a year of your life trying to like
1393380	1403100	make a project about this weird abandoned facility but I would not put it on my list of like general
1403100	1409140	books to recommend for reading also I love there's like this picture here of this of this poor dude
1409140	1416420	on the bottom where they're like oh yeah here's a guy I don't remember where that plant is but
1416420	1425900	here's a guy his job is to transport nitroglycerin using this little like rickety looking baskets I
1425900	1432780	would not want to have to transport nitroglycerin using this thing and I say in the beginning of
1432780	1438100	the video that 60 people or about 60 people died in the manufacturing plant in California
1438100	1446020	I didn't say it clearly enough in the video because it really was just the people in that
1446020	1453460	plant in California there were plenty other of plenty other explosions nationwide related to
1453460	1462740	Hercules and all the various things that they did but yeah so anyway this book exists and yeah I
1462740	1469580	thought it was gonna be a gold mine that would solve all of my problems but nope did someone
1469580	1475700	post an Amazon link in the in the ghost chat hey if you know if you want to read it I'm not gonna
1475700	1481620	stop you oh yeah if you're totally right a plus on the book's name though labors of a modern
1481620	1487700	Hercules is an amazing title for that book like a plus oh I forgot to mention the other weird thing
1487700	1499340	about the book is it was written in like 1990 or 1989 and so at the very end there's mention of
1499340	1506540	how in the facility that I mentioned later West Baucus the author of the book saw all the Soviet
1506540	1512060	inspectors there as part of the facility and he's like oh what a what a new world we live in where
1512100	1518180	the Soviet Union is here at Hercules manufacturing facilities in the United States like how strange
1518180	1525700	is that and it was also super frustrating to me because since the book stopped in 89 or 90 all of
1525700	1532500	the questions I had about how this how this gigantic company went out of business like what
1532500	1537380	are the details none of those were present in the book because all of that happened like five years
1537380	1542980	later and there was a lot of digging around online to try to like answer that question more
1542980	1549420	precisely but again you have to realize at some point this isn't actually a video about the
1549420	1556900	company Hercules right I'm not adopting or I'm not adapting labors of a modern Hercules into a video
1556900	1563580	I'm supposed to be making a video about what this weird place called ticoi was so yeah this is this
1563580	1568380	is part of like the decisions that you have to make behind the scenes local products but their
1568380	1573740	smokeless gunpowder rapidly grew them to become a vital United States military supplier during the
1573740	1580180	world wars as the posters said Hercules men and women in the war keep them shooting I always love
1580180	1584700	these old war posters it's like these old propaganda posters they have such a distinct look
1584700	1589860	to them and it's like here's here's Uncle Sam he's trying to he's trying to raise money by selling
1589980	1594780	war bonds it's not clear in the video but the context of this is I think he's trying to guilt
1594780	1599900	the people who live in the factory town of Hercules like hey guys I know you're literally
1599900	1605660	manufacturing the bullets from my weapons but it's not enough you also have to buy Uncle Sam's war
1605660	1611100	bonds you come over to these so I found I found a few of these on the National Archives do I have
1611100	1618380	the other one so again I think these are like propaganda slash recruitment posters for Hercules
1618380	1625540	these were produced these are produced during the Second World War I find their messaging is like a
1625540	1632100	little mixed it's a little bit unclear like what they're what they're trying to what they're
1632100	1638540	trying to say here I'm glad of the chance to do something real while my husband's in the army and
1638540	1648020	say you know these machinists are swell that's like Sophie I like I get I feel like I get the
1648020	1653500	message but maybe there's there's like a better there's a better way to word this especially
1653500	1658780	because like these machinists are swell I'd like what do you what do you mean by that and it's you
1658780	1666860	know the I get to do something real it's just it's just odd it's odd messaging you know or like the
1666860	1672540	other guy over here he's putting in a full day every day at Hercules and he has to otherwise
1672540	1678020	he'd be letting down his kid who works in the parachute troops like you know that's a lot of
1678020	1682940	pressure yeah I don't know I just I find these kinds of things these sorts of posters really
1682940	1690060	interesting and there's one more can I pull it up yeah so here's the third one so this little logo
1690060	1695260	is is just pulled out from a third one that had a different color scheme which is which is this
1695260	1701620	guy he's talking to his he's talking to his buddies we may not be welding tanks but boy
1701620	1708740	we're keeping a Hercules plant running and that's something in this war it's just amazing it's a bit
1708740	1714460	like the old newsreels and propaganda videos where it's the same thing like there's something
1714460	1721780	earnest and deceptive about them at the same time Mary yeah posters were so wordy back then
1721860	1727220	yeah that's that's right people had more time to read posters back in in 1940 like what else
1727220	1730300	are you gonna do you don't have a smartphone to distract you you might as well read all the
1730300	1735540	propaganda posters being posted on the wall yeah no they look like they show up in a Fallout game
1735540	1741220	for sure cold war came next and brought with it a new weapon the intercontinental ballistic missile
1741220	1746980	tipped with a nuclear warhead now one country could destroy another remotely and the only
1746980	1753020	defense was a credible threat of retaliation this drew the United States and the Soviet Union into
1753020	1760540	an arms race I was working with the animator for a long time on this shot and the the sort of
1760540	1767140	inspiration and and the the design for this concept was a little bit of the the screens
1767140	1772300	in war games the movie all right so that like at the end there's all of these like these maps and
1772420	1777300	you're seeing all of the nuclear weapons spread on the maps you know and and that was kind of the
1777300	1783460	like the direction that I gave for this one is like what what it what if the you know the the
1783460	1789620	war game stuff like we're seeing it happen on an actual globe it's not happening on like on a
1789620	1795300	computer screen it states and the Soviet Union into an arms race building more and faster and
1795300	1800420	bigger nuclear weapons each year for the again this thing like the animator did the absolute
1800420	1807020	last minute just just today was animating in this graph which I just love I totally love the way it
1807020	1813940	looks like I love the cool smoky look and if it looks familiar this is the same effect that was
1813940	1820340	used on the time travel portal in the national popular interstate vote compact when gray goes
1820340	1824940	back in time there's like a blue smoky portal and that's the same effect that's being used on the
1824940	1830420	edge of the line up here United States this culminated with the Minuteman unlike earlier
1830420	1835220	missiles which had to be launched out in the open and were slow to fuel with liquid propellant the
1835220	1840820	Minuteman could be launched from an underground silo and thus be hidden in America's cornfields
1840820	1846100	the new solid fuel motors able to launch them instantly yeah so this is also I don't know how
1846100	1850700	clear this is to people like what what you're actually looking at here but it's really quite
1850700	1856420	shocking how open the United States is with some of the information about its nuclear weapons
1856420	1861740	program and you know one of the things that it's open about is is the location of some of these
1861740	1869300	nuclear silos but yeah if you like zoom in on Google Earth and you're looking around in a
1869300	1876460	northwestern Nebraska you can totally just find the nuclear silos if you know what you're looking
1876660	1882500	for this is a little hatch that opens up the Minuteman missile is underneath there's a little
1882500	1888780	bit of a entryway above ground for the military personnel to go into and and like the whole
1888780	1894900	facility is is under the ground here you know this is this is like unnamed country road number
1894900	1901860	four just going through a bunch of farmland but if you turn right at the correct moment it's like
1901860	1908500	oh and there is a Minuteman 3 nuclear missile underneath the ground right along the side there
1908500	1914260	it's crazy yes I know that you can tour some of these things another thing that has just is killed
1914260	1920260	it's killed me be that this there's like not being able to go outside thing is is heartbreaking
1920260	1925460	because yeah I know that there are places where you can tour some of these facilities that are
1925460	1932540	no longer active and this is a case where my original summer plans part of what I was going
1932540	1939180	to do was I wanted to wrap up this ticoi project by going back to Skull Valley and being able to
1939180	1947900	do a few more things like I wanted this project to be more of a thing than it ended up being but
1947900	1952740	the practicalities of it were just like look who knows when I'm going to be able to travel next
1952980	1960020	this project is already more than a year old I've got to wrap it up otherwise I am going to go crazy
1960020	1968340	but I would really have loved to be able to have made a trip to one of these silos that you can see
1968340	1974140	in person but that was not in the cards for this year so maybe it'll have to be a future episode
1974140	1980820	of Grey Goes Outside but we harvest corn here corn and nukes yeah that feels again very very
1980940	1987140	American like what a week what do we grow we grow nuclear weapons and we grow corn oh I have to I
1987140	1992340	have to show you like can I find it really quickly though but again some of these old videos about
1992340	1999420	like how the how the weapons work are totally crazy pants okay all right so this I just love
1999420	2006100	it this is this is the like the glory of America all right the minute man is ready primed in the
2006100	2012980	earth beneath its hardened blast-proof cap in the vast open lands of America from the
2012980	2021980	grasses of Wyoming to the North Dakota plains from the North Dakota standing guard amidst the
2021980	2030140	old ports silent sentinels of freedom on strategic alert in the defense of America
2036100	2044180	I just love it like it's amazing right they're like oh we have these nuclear weapons that can
2044180	2050180	fly out of the ground but like what are they doing they're protecting our beautiful grasslands and
2050180	2056780	and like oh there's silent sentinels in the ground we've got children with ponies to protect and we
2056780	2065100	need nuclear weapons it's amazing these things are totally they're totally unreal there's one
2065100	2070740	I don't know if I can find it really quick the reason I have these these videos that loaded up
2070740	2078500	in Final Cut I had a I had a brief cut of this project where I included I included some of this
2078500	2085020	footage but I decided like it just didn't fit tonally I wanted this to be just like okay I went
2085020	2089300	to this place and now I'm going to explain to you what it was and it was a little bit weird to cut
2089300	2096100	sometimes to this old like propaganda footage and then to cut back but I really did I really did
2096100	2102500	greatly enjoy producing some of this stuff so is this the it's this video where the narrator is
2102500	2108140	like really passive-aggressive about the Soviet Union and like America has to protect the world
2108140	2113220	and the Soviet Union doesn't I think it's this part all of these various projects while perhaps
2113220	2119260	not sufficiently emphasized in light of today's events did help the Air Force to understand the
2119260	2125860	problems of pilotless missiles and to begin to build its operational force Russia in the meantime
2125860	2134620	not hampered by having to police the world that's what it is right they're like we're working on our
2134620	2140380	missiles program Russia meanwhile like they get to just be the baddies because they don't have to
2140380	2146760	police the world it's amazing Russia in the meantime not hampered by having to police the
2146760	2152880	world concentrate on whatever weapon of war she desired since Russia did not have to worry about
2152880	2157880	aggressive attack from the free world she could jump ahead and develop weapons of the future at
2157880	2164680	her discretion this is we now know she did this is amazing right like because we're the goodies
2164680	2170080	like she didn't have to worry about us attacking them so they so like she got to make all the evil
2170080	2176360	weapons that she wanted which is such a weird like it's such a weird way to explain this
2176360	2182480	situation plus like given contemporary documents we now have of like what was going on at the time
2182480	2187280	we totally know that Russia was like their number one concern was like the rest of the world was
2187280	2193260	going to invade them at any moment but this propaganda film portrays it like oh the Soviet
2193260	2199000	Union knew that like the good guys would never attack them and so they just went on to build a
2199000	2204080	bunch of nuclear weapons because they're evil unlike our nuclear weapons which we're building
2204080	2210000	because we're policing the world it's just amazing you know what no I've got to I've got to stop well
2210000	2219360	just okay one more this gleaming metallic instrument is being developed in a race against time the Air
2219360	2227120	Force plans to win by taking calculated risks based on sound technical judgment only once
2227120	2233000	before in the Manhattan Project has this nation taken a comparable gamble of such billion dollar
2233000	2240920	immensity that time the stake was atomic energy to stop a war this time we aim for a ballistic
2240920	2250480	missile force to keep the peace yeah we're gonna keep that peace we're gonna keep it it's amazing
2251320	2258400	you know it's just like this gleaming weapon this is this is ours right there's bad things
2258400	2262760	happening in the world but this is these are these are ballistic weapons to keep the peace
2262760	2268040	like I just love the way it's presented you know I mean like you can totally have a conversation
2268040	2274640	that's reasonable and about like what safety do nuclear weapons provide and like the game
2274640	2280080	theoretical logic of mutually assured just like you can have this conversation and you can be on
2280080	2283960	either side of like does this makes does this make people safe does it not make people like
2283960	2289840	there's an adult conversation to be had there but this is just like hilarious propaganda for
2289840	2297160	children yes that's right lizard heart that's exactly right it's like the beautiful good
2297160	2302960	nuclear weapons versus the evil nuclear weapons also I don't know if you noticed but like whoever
2302960	2311400	made this film I totally love you know this is like 1950s Final Cut editor but you notice how
2311400	2318240	like the America stuff is all blue and beautiful and Russia is evil and red right it's like look
2318240	2325200	at our beautiful blue bombers like look at this evil Soviet Union it's hilarious okay all right
2325200	2330280	I'm getting distracted I'm sorry okay here we go launched out in the open and we're slow to fuel
2330280	2335240	with liquid propellant the Minuteman could be launched from an underground silo and thus be
2335240	2341000	hidden in America's cornfields the new solid fuel motors able to launch them instantly the
2341000	2346320	United States ordered 1,000 Minuteman missiles to be constructed which brings us back to Hercules
2346320	2352560	and ticoi for as a bullet in a round needs powder to hit a target so too does the nuclear warhead in
2352560	2358520	a Minuteman missile need its solid fuel motor I don't think this quite worked in the video I was
2358840	2364000	trying to draw this analogy like if I was going to spend an infinite amount of time rewriting it
2364000	2370560	I feel like I would have wanted to draw this analogy more closely that Hercules got their
2370560	2375480	start manufacturing this smokeless gunpowder that's like really what gave them their start
2375480	2381280	now in in the time that we're talking about like what was ticoi they're manufacturing the like
2381280	2389600	gunpowder equivalent of an ICBM but I don't think it quite came across right and again that this is
2389600	2394440	where you have to you have to put limits on how much you're going to rewrite things or rerecord
2394440	2399680	things or try to make stuff like perfectly fit together I also feel like this is a little bit
2399680	2406160	of a probably for most viewers of the channel like again doing the director's commentaries
2406160	2411080	right after I don't know how people are reacting but I wouldn't be surprised if this is a video
2411280	2418600	that a lot of people think is kind of boring so you know I've already spent probably way more
2418600	2424800	time on this than makes any kind of economic sense but I did get I did get a little bit obsessed with
2424800	2431420	it need its solid fuel motor Hercules manufactured the motors at a plant called Bacchus West in Magna
2431420	2437160	Utah and brought them to ticoi for testing the large concrete cubes still here are thrust blocks
2437160	2442160	their purpose to be an immovable object for a missile motor to push against during test firing
2442160	2447400	each motor needed to be individually calibrated hitting a target a quarter of the world away while
2447400	2455080	traveling at mach 20 is a precise affair excellent work by the animator to do the ICBM here and even
2455080	2461180	when I was just sent the like the really rough version of it like here's the outline of what we
2461180	2467720	want I think it really is kind of shocking to see how it motor works you know okay there's a
2467720	2474220	missile that goes up in into the sky and then it turns around and it comes back down but I really
2474220	2482180	do think there's something quite visceral about seeing what is basically a parabolic arc right
2482180	2488020	that people like you intrinsically know from things like throwing a baseball or whatever and
2488180	2493580	the way the animation is of the actual warheads coming down like I think it it's really quite a
2493580	2497820	striking piece of animation like it's it's it's incredibly well done you know it's not the whole
2497820	2502380	missile that comes down and and strikes I think that's a bit of a misconception that people have
2502380	2509620	that it's like the missile hits but it really is just this tiny payload at the very end which are
2509620	2517980	the warheads and the intercontinental ballistic missile can have many warheads and I think the
2517980	2525020	the early Minutemen had two later versions had three and I don't know I don't know what the
2525020	2529860	what the current state of technology is for warhead miniaturization but yeah I think it really is
2529860	2534900	quite striking just to see the like the simplicity of it thrust block technicians would connect
2535900	2540860	to measure heat and pressure and those sensors connected via underground cables to instrument
2540860	2546220	bunkers where engineers would record the results with state-of-the-art 1970s computer assistants
2546220	2551740	set up for each test could take a week or more so the motor and engineers and equipment had to be
2551740	2556860	protected from the elements but a missile can't be fired inside a building without melting the
2556860	2562320	structure around it and invalidating the test to solve so this is this is finally the part of the
2562320	2571800	video where I actually get to kind of explain like much more what ticoi is and again part of
2571800	2578840	the reason why I had such a hard time finishing up this project is like my original vision was I
2578840	2585000	never intended for there to be two videos I wanted for there to be one video that was both the
2585000	2592400	exploration and the explanation at the same time that was the original idea but when I was making
2592400	2599920	the first exploration video just the fact of the matter was there is absolutely nothing available
2599920	2608400	that could show what did this facility look like you know it was a classified facility and many of
2608400	2614600	the things related to it are still classified today and so I ended up having to just make the
2614600	2620960	first video a pure explanation one and kind of putting out a little call for like hey if you
2620960	2627360	know anything get in touch in the end I actually feel like it worked better as two parts I like
2627360	2634180	having the explanation and the exploration separate but I had originally thought when I
2634180	2638920	put up the exploration video I was like oh I'll have the explanation done in in two weeks I'm
2638920	2643800	gonna I'm gonna wrap this up real quick but meanwhile like two months of very solid work
2643800	2650760	later it's it's finally actually done but it is very surreal personally for me to see like oh
2650760	2659160	here's this footage of me in this location and then to see test footage from the time of like oh
2659160	2665880	I know exactly which thrust block that is you know there's three thrust blocks on site and this is
2665880	2672040	the big one that was at the you know the far end of the facility so it's it's a it's a strange
2672040	2679120	experience personally let's go let's move on to the exciting parts solve this the buildings at
2679120	2684240	ticoi were constructed on rails so they could be pulled back before firing and also give the
2684240	2691080	nearby camera houses a clear view of the test this will be the fine of d5 second stage at 5b
2691080	2706480	250 minus ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero we have ignition Hercules did
2706480	2712440	improve thanks chat I'm glad the chat seems to agree that they like the the two parts that it
2712440	2719320	worked yeah I do think in the end it works better than my original idea I just you know I just never
2719440	2725920	expected it to take this long or to be this much work as always is the case I think oh I'm at the
2725920	2733040	Skull Valley Reservation working on what is the the main project and this and this will be just a
2733040	2739120	fun little diversion this this will be just like a oh look what a what a little a small fractal
2739120	2745280	shard that I can pick up and just easily turn into a fun video about what this place is it's
2745440	2753000	fast-forward a year and several months later and it's finally done okay so here here is where we
2753000	2758680	get the actual labeling of the facility so yeah this this is like where it comes together you
2758680	2762760	can see what all the different parts are you have that the test site which is in the building on
2762760	2769640	rails the thrust block is inside that building if the instrumentation bunker there are three camera
2769640	2776280	houses there's another one which is being hidden by the building itself and then the lightning rods
2776280	2781360	that are around it to divert the lightning strikes and I feel like I'm incredibly lucky that there
2781360	2789200	was an oncoming storm when I happened to be filming this you're glad the storm was correctly
2789200	2794800	labeled do you like I spent a long time trying to figure out if I could put an arrow to point
2794800	2799120	to the storm but it just didn't work so I ended up going with like a little label just like I can
2799120	2805420	label the whole background okay killed a t-coin oh right so yeah here we get to serious part
2805420	2812360	explosions nonetheless one man was killed a t-coin in 1984 crushed beneath a motor that came loose
2812360	2817360	during securement to the test block an accident for which the United States Occupational Safety
2817360	2824280	and Health Administration find Hercules 640 doll I had to kind of have my assistant just sanity
2824280	2829800	check me on this one of like does this report really say six hundred and forty dollars like
2829800	2836760	is that actually is that actually correct you know and and you can you can look up this accident
2836760	2845000	reports on on OSHA there's a description at the bottom which is you know it's a it's a little
2845000	2852640	difficult to understand I feel like if a man died on a facility like maybe you could include
2852680	2861480	a diagram not just a bunch of all caps sentences with tech jargon but yeah he was crushed to death
2861480	2868880	underneath the missile motor when it came loose and yeah I cannot believe that the penalty was
2868880	2876640	six hundred and forty dollars you know even if you do inflation from like 1984 dollars to now
2876720	2882520	that's not enough dollars but the thing is like right it's six hundred and forty dollars but
2882520	2888720	that's infinity more dollars than all of the people who died in the explosions in the original plant
2888720	2897720	in California or all the stuff before OSHA existed so I guess like this is an improved upward trend
2897720	2903360	but it was still really is really quite shocking to come across this as as part of the research
2904240	2909360	dollars the end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules the United States had
2909360	2914480	been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them ticoy was used
2914480	2919880	less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up leading
2919880	2925320	to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s what I'm saying right here about ticoy became a storage
2925320	2930560	facility I think this is also part of the reason going back to the very beginning why by the time
2930560	2935760	I get there it's you know where it's been abandoned for a long time there's not much
2935760	2941360	confidentiality there's not much confidential equipment left on site or like those things had
2941360	2949360	already started to be removed it seems like you know by the mid 1990s or so that that the ticoy
2949360	2955240	facility was already on the way down though the United States no longer needed the facility for
2955240	2961560	strategic production it was still strategically useful in a different way politics in 1991 the
2961560	2966480	United States and the Soviet Union signed start the strategic arms reduction treaty where both
2966480	2971600	agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles because of course neither country
2971600	2976400	was just going to take the word of the other numerous trust but verify policies were put into
2976400	2981640	place for example both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the others
2981640	2987200	satellites to see this little detail it doesn't really belong in this story of of ticoy but I
2987200	2994400	found this too fascinating not to include and I can't I can't imagine ever coming across this in
2994400	2999600	a video again as a place to mention it but there's something really that I find quite amazing about
2999600	3007280	these photographs of bombers and it was it was in the treaty that they had to be like all the tail
3007280	3014960	fins had to be cut off and they were literally left out just out in the open so that the spy
3014960	3022120	satellites from the other country would be able to see them and to confirm that they had been
3022120	3029760	dismantled it's an interesting question about trying to disarm and I mean we'll get to the
3029760	3036360	inspectors in just a second but it is a it's a weird thing when you think about it like how do
3036440	3044400	you try to let someone else know that you actually have disarmed and that you haven't like hidden a
3044400	3049240	bunch of bombers somewhere else that they don't know about it's a it's a difficult question and
3049240	3054280	this is this is one of oops this is one of the mechanisms that they tried to come up with and
3054280	3061080	presumably because like each of these are just so expensive to make that even if you were like
3061200	3068000	hiding bombers you're still incurring such a tremendous cost on yourself by destroying a
3068000	3072560	bunch of these things. Gombos to answer the question how long were they left there I don't
3072560	3077760	remember I do I know I came across it in the treaty at some point that they had to be left
3077760	3084000	out for a certain period of time but I don't I don't remember offhand I don't remember offhand
3084000	3089280	what that was there and nothing a bit of shiny tape couldn't fix I would not want to fly in a
3089280	3098560	plane where where they had welded the the tail fin back on no thank you. The open for the others
3098560	3103800	satellites to see and each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect the
3103800	3108240	United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets one of which was the
3108240	3115880	ticoi test ring this is also where to go back to the book from before where is it so on this list
3115880	3124680	you can see that a couple of the other test sites Hercules plant number one Magna Utah and I forget
3124680	3129880	somewhere else somewhere else on here is another Hercules plant but I think the Hercules plant in
3129880	3137760	Magna Utah is the the one where they were building the motors and this is the one that the authors of
3137760	3142840	labor of a modern Hercules were observing and where they saw the Soviet inspectors as part of
3142840	3148520	that process is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance temporary housing for the inspection
3148520	3153600	team was built in the Soviet Union to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls
3153600	3159200	or tampered with the equipment and transported to Utah forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna the
3159200	3164280	flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved and inspection duties fell to the
3164280	3173560	Russian Federation these bunkers okay you know what let me get to the end of the video but don't
3173560	3177840	let me forget about the bunkers because I have a bunch of things to say at the bunkers but let's
3177840	3185240	just let's let's finish this off Russian Federation ticoi limped on during the inspection period but
3185240	3191160	in 1995 with too many cancelled contracts the now failing Hercules incorporated put itself up for
3191160	3198040	sale acquired by Alliant tech systems and American aerospace defense and sporting goods company okay
3198040	3203440	yeah so that's not that's not like a joke as far as I can tell Alliant tech systems really does
3203440	3209960	make military gear and sporting equipment which I guess kind of makes sense like I didn't look into
3209960	3217720	it too far but maybe that stuff like paintball guns and body pads like I have I have no idea and
3217760	3224200	again you can't research absolutely everything but someone had asked the question earlier about
3224200	3231520	Hercules going bankrupt or going out of business I should say they didn't go bankrupt they sold
3231520	3239440	themselves off and yeah I found it kind of frustrating because I wanted to know more of
3239440	3246520	the details about like how does this happen how does a company that is a major supplier to the
3246880	3254720	US military go out of business and you know there weren't great answers like we were able to find a
3254720	3260360	bunch of articles at the time but they would all just like say these vague things about cancelled
3260360	3267720	contracts so I don't have a good answer but I do find it interesting like how enormous companies
3267720	3273480	can just disappear and so I kind of guess or presume that with Hercules it's the same way
3273480	3280640	that it goes with a lot of other big companies that they they end up acquiring a lot of fixed
3280640	3287760	costs over time and then if the market just slightly changes like they're left with a huge
3287760	3291720	number of fixed costs and it's hard to be profitable that's what puts them in trouble
3291720	3298880	and they end up going bankrupt or as Hercules did selling themselves off I didn't mention it
3298880	3306760	in the video but Hercules split into two and they sold all of the missile stuff to Alliant
3306760	3315360	tech systems the actual Hercules company existed for I can't remember I think until like 2004 and
3315360	3319480	then the rest of the company got bought by someone else and I don't remember off the top of my head
3319480	3326320	who that was but but this is again where you have to make a decision in a video and it's like does
3326320	3330600	it matter that not all of Hercules was sold off in this moment probably not we can just sort of
3330600	3335720	simplify that and say like Hercules was sold off even though part of it continued to exist but yeah
3335720	3342760	I I really wish that labors of a modern Hercules had been written six years later it could have
3342760	3346560	covered the details of how did this actually disappear but you know what even if it had been
3346560	3351200	written later without a doubt I would have read it found it interesting and probably written a
3351200	3357680	similar sentence that just kind of glosses over quickly like what what is that that happened I
3357680	3362520	included this this was like one of the few things I could find for Alliant tech systems at the time
3362520	3367880	but I love this image that they had on their website of like Alliant tech systems we make
3367880	3375480	rockets and guns and it's just you know America has a very America culture that I can't help but
3375480	3382320	love right like it's it's like ridiculous and awesome at the same time right it's it's like
3382320	3388840	it's why it's often parodied in like the Fallout games and that kind of stuff is is there's there
3388840	3396400	is a sort of ridiculous and awesome like don't tread on me American s and it definitely comes
3396400	3402560	definitely comes through sometimes American aerospace defense and sporting goods company
3402560	3408860	in 1999 the lease on this land expired Alliant tech systems did not renew and control of the
3408860	3413560	Ticoi test range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation within the borders of which
3413560	3421080	Ticoi sits I know what I'm doing here and I I intentionally did want to wait the whole video
3421080	3427560	before mentioning that this is actually on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation because it because
3427560	3433840	I do think there's there's not a small number of viewers who were paying attention and who
3433840	3437640	even if they're not watching the directors commentaries they're like they're not watching
3437640	3443280	the behind-the-scenes stuff I imagine for a lot of viewers this is like the lightbulb moment that
3443280	3450760	explains oh this is what all like this nonsense has been with these two videos that gray made like
3450760	3456280	why did he make this video where he just walks around an abandoned place why is he telling me
3456280	3462280	about a bunch of Cold War nonsense that I don't care about oh he was out there for the Indian
3462280	3467960	reservations and like all of this is just a fractal off of that again for me as a viewer
3467960	3475320	you know the kinds of things that I watch I like those moments like I really appreciate when a
3475320	3482960	creator sort of lets you in on like hey you're a viewer who pays attention this is a detail that I
3482960	3489800	know you will love and will make it feel like the puzzle pieces have come together so it is part of
3489800	3495000	the reason why like on the earlier maps or in the beginning of the video I don't say it first hey
3495000	3502080	this is on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation I wait until the last possible second to mention
3502080	3511600	it and links yes you're totally right one of my favorite things about driving out west is these
3511640	3520240	Buffalo crossing signs like they are amazing and I mean you know I can't say I can't say too much
3520240	3526880	but the the Skull Valley go shoot Indian tribe they do have a pack of Buffalo we'll leave it at
3526880	3533340	that it operates no more its work lives on of the 1,000 minute man missiles constructed during the
3533340	3540400	Cold War 400 are still active waiting with their solid fuel motors calibrated here at Ticoi to
3540400	3549640	launch at a moment's notice so I don't know how surprising that end is for people I think I don't
3549640	3554840	know for me before going out to Ticoi and before reading about any of this stuff there's a there's
3554840	3565680	a way in which I tend to think of the Cold War as oh the the Cold War is over like it's a thing
3565680	3575800	that happened a long time ago and is is totally irrelevant and while that is true with almost all
3575800	3581760	of history and almost all of wars there is a way in which I think the Cold War is is different
3581760	3590440	because a lot of the stuff that was made during the Cold War is still sitting around waiting to
3590440	3598200	destroy the world and that's that's part of what's going on with this Ticoi project is like I mean
3598200	3607000	yeah this is all like ancient history you know this this facility was built and operated before
3607000	3613920	I was born it's definitely built and operated before almost everyone watching this video was
3613920	3623040	born and and shut down before a lot of those viewers were born but unlike most of the boring
3623040	3627680	history stuff it's like yeah but the missile motors that pass through here are still sitting
3627680	3637480	in bunkers out in cornfields all over America just like waiting to go off and yeah it's it's
3637480	3642240	just weird and uncomfortable to think about yeah it's just uncomfortable to think about
3642240	3652200	that is the ending of the Ticoi video and a project that I felt like was was never going
3652200	3661040	to end in my life yeah some some projects they take a long time some projects they really feel
3661040	3670760	like they take a long time and for sure the the Ticoi project it felt like the long project that
3670800	3677600	was this one I feel like it just it took a little bit took a little bit too long for me to actually
3677600	3686360	bring it to the wraps Oh Oh Florence thank you so much bunkers I almost forgot okay I and and I
3686360	3690560	can't believe I almost forgot because this is the thing that I was the most obsessed about okay
3690560	3697480	bunkers bunkers bunkers how do I how do I even know how to begin with this okay so at some point
3697480	3705840	in researching this project I came across this incidental piece of information that like oh hey
3705840	3711240	all of these inspection sites right if you look at the inspection list you'll see there's a ton
3711240	3717920	of stuff in Utah it's like oh the UTTR is out there the the Dugway Proving Ground is out there
3717920	3724320	there's like a lot of military stuff out there and the United States as part of SALT and START
3724320	3729920	treaties invited the Soviet Union to come out and inspect them and it's like okay what are you
3729920	3736480	gonna do with these Soviet inspectors you got to put them somewhere and the Soviet Union built
3736480	3743760	housing that it's sent to the United States for their inspectors to live in because they were
3743760	3750680	paranoid about the US spying on their inspectors they were paranoid about the equipment being
3751320	3760080	messed with and apparently they were also paranoid enough that they had sanitize its electrical
3760080	3764880	separation between the power supply and the bunker where you're like smoothing out the electrical
3764880	3772560	signal like the Soviets did not do not trust the United States very much so I do not know why but
3772560	3779240	I became really obsessed with these bunkers because wherever I initially found out this
3779240	3784120	piece of information it was like this casual off-handed thing that said like oh by the way
3784120	3793440	these bunkers still exist I was like oh really that's interesting the bunkers still exist
3793440	3800960	somewhere and this is also where the global pandemic was incredibly frustrating because
3800960	3808600	if that had not been happening 100% I would have flown back to Utah to find these bunkers
3808640	3817960	so this project ended up having to be done entirely online and I cannot cannot give enough
3817960	3829160	credit to my assistant who just did did a herculean amount of work to track down where these
3829160	3838000	bunkers were and to to get the photographs that you're seeing now like phone calls over the course
3838040	3846880	of a year to many military installations and Utah research installations and like yeah just
3846880	3855320	a tremendous amount of work the number of human hours on this is unbelievable I don't know if I'm
3855320	3860880	gonna be able to find this just off the top of my head yes thank you guys for congratulating my
3860880	3865520	assistant here you know one of the things with patreon like obviously you're supporting me
3865520	3870600	writing and researching the videos and obviously you're supporting the animator and like the music
3870600	3876120	and everything else my assistant does a tremendous amount of additional work like helping these
3876120	3885560	things to happen and like the whole ticoi project getting in touch with the skull Valley reservation
3885560	3890800	and like getting permission to be on ticoi like that never would have happened without
3890920	3897120	her being able to take lead on that project and so like yes there's many things many things that
3897120	3907520	that happen because of her so okay so where are we here okay so this is Utah so you've got Salt
3907520	3913960	Lake City is over here skull Valley is over here we've got the giant desert so originally the
3913960	3919600	inspectors were all in magna Utah which is sort of right by West Valley City it's over here for
3919600	3928800	reasons that I cannot remember off the top of my head the bunkers after the Soviet Union collapsed
3928800	3936000	the Russian Federation was inspecting for a while and then the start treaty came to an end and the
3936000	3944360	bunkers were vacated and they ended up all the way on the other side of the Salt Lake Desert in
3945200	3954520	Wendover so Wendover is this little town that's right on the Utah Nevada border they were slash
3954520	3962480	are a Air Force Base kind of town the historic Wendover Airfield Museum is the place where it
3962480	3972160	was reported that these trailers ended up but I was determined to try to find out like for real
3972160	3981040	where are these things and if you now am I going to be able to do it just from memory okay here we
3981040	3990400	go boom okay so we went on a Google Street View and right outside the Historical Society in this
3990400	3998080	town you can see that there are a bunch of bunkers we eventually were able to get it confirmed that
3998080	4006160	yes this is where the bunkers that the Soviet inspectors used ended up and so there's I think
4006160	4014840	there's three or four of them that are in this this place and again through tremendous tremendous
4014840	4023400	effort we were able to get some photographs of the things so hold on let me pull this up okay so I
4023600	4029120	mentioned before like there was just nothing that existed that existed publicly about what did
4029120	4036280	t-coi look when it was being operated and it was a very similar situation for these Soviet trailers
4036280	4043000	like come on guys there's got to be pictures of this at the time and again what my assistant was
4043000	4050320	able to do with just an ungodly number of hours spent on the project was eventually tracked down
4050320	4062400	some boxes that were at the Utah State Archives and these boxes did not have date labels on them
4062400	4070680	they were like boxes of photographs from Magna Utah around this time like none of the photographs
4070680	4077680	are labeled they're not ordered there's no information on them but she was able to convince
4077760	4086280	one of the researchers there to scan some of the photographs for us that looked promising that they
4086280	4093320	might be bunker photos from the time and then we were able to by looking at the outsides confirm
4093320	4099280	like yes some of these are totally the Soviet bunkers these are the photographs from the inside
4099280	4104400	this is the one that I've used in the video but some of these photos are a little mysterious so
4104400	4110000	like this looks like it's the inside of one of the bunkers it was with the other bunker photos
4110000	4116960	it who knows like what's the deal where is this photograph taken is this is this when it was
4116960	4124360	constructed in in the Soviet Union is this in America like who knows there's just a bunch of
4124360	4130880	photos of like inspectors you can totally see like this is definitely out in Utah here's inspectors
4130920	4137120	investigating like a housing for one of the missiles guys hanging out like having a little
4137120	4144040	picnic it took forever to try to find these photos and this was like you know I don't know if you've
4144040	4151800	ever worked on a really long research project but we were so pumped when we finally were able to get
4151800	4158520	some of these photos and it's like excited all out of perspective with like what these images
4158520	4165480	actually are but to have been tracking them down for so long to actually get your hands on
4165480	4173040	something that was like in a box in an archive somewhere undated it was it was just it was just
4173040	4179120	incredible if I can get the other one so this is the other thing that I then really like so in
4179120	4185920	addition to tracking down like what were the archival images we were also able to get the
4185920	4193680	Wendover Historical Society to go inside these bunkers that had been like untouched on their
4193680	4200000	grounds in decades and just take some pictures from the inside of like what do these things
4200000	4207440	actually look like and so here is the state of the bunkers today and so you can see like this is
4207440	4213720	this is what's left inside there's the sign in Russian here is again like some of the old
4213760	4219600	equipment and the desks that they they sat at like again just equipment that's left inside
4219600	4229560	they're in really rough shape as you can see but like this is this is what's left of these bunkers
4229560	4234880	and here's what it looks like from the outside this is what from like a month ago I guess this
4234880	4240600	photograph and this this was really amazing because again if the pandemic had not been occurring I
4240600	4247000	would have flown to Wendover to try to like talk my way into these things but because that that
4247000	4253560	wasn't possible you know my my assistant was able to do the next best thing and like get the
4253560	4261080	Historical Society to take some photographs of what they look like I really really wanted to
4261080	4268920	work these into the video after so much effort trying to find them but here's the thing like
4268920	4276280	what is the video about the video is not about these trailers they're not really part of this
4276280	4283880	they're like an incidental part of the story it only loosely connects because they were in Magna
4283880	4290680	and Magna is also where the missiles were manufactured by Hercules and and so by the
4290680	4297080	time that I mentioned the bunkers we're already really at the end of the video and so to have a
4297080	4301720	little diversion about like oh these bunkers still exist today and here's some photos of
4301720	4307720	them like I just could not make it work in the actual video but I just really wanted to show
4308360	4315160	everyone who crowdfunds like look at these pictures we found isn't it amazing it was
4315160	4323320	incredibly exciting to find them and and so much so that I want to thank everyone who crowdfunds
4323320	4332360	the channel because what we're doing is we are donating to the Wendover Historical Society
4332360	4339960	to get one of these bunkers restored we are donating to them so that they can actually
4339960	4344680	turn one of these things into the best restoration of what it was at the time
4345720	4352840	that's possible perhaps someday when the global pandemic is over if you happen to find yourself
4352920	4361160	traveling through Wendover and you want to make a little diversion there will be a restored soviet
4361160	4370840	cold war inspection bunker related to the crazy ticoi project out there to see so thank you all
4370840	4379320	of the crowdfunders for making these sorts of videos possible and thank you for letting us
4379320	4386760	help try to restore something in the real world that's actually related to one of these projects
4387560	4396760	it's it's this one has been a real real journey guys so thank you so much that is the end of the
4396760	4404760	short director's commentary for the evening and stay safe and I'll see you in the next one
4409320	4409820	you
