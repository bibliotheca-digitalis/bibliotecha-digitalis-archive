1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
Okay, yeah, it is a bit late for coffee in the UK, but upload days now with the addition

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,680
of director's commentary days are very long days.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,880
So I'm quite tired by the end of it, but I feel like the right way to do this is to do

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,480
the director's commentary on the same day of upload.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,120
If I don't do the director's commentary on the same day, then I know what's going to

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,720
happen, which is I'm going to start really preparing for it and then I'm going to turn

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,880
it into a whole other job and then it will never happen.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,260
So this is why it's like director's commentary right away, whatever I happen to remember

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,520
or nothing.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,240
So that's the way it's going to work.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,960
This is a video that I really didn't expect I was going to do a director's commentary

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,680
for because I mean, obviously this is only the fourth one, so I'm still kind of figuring

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:05,560
this out, but for the Grey Goes Outside playlist things that I've been working on, these already

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,640
feel a little bit like they're behind the scenes videos anyway, so it's a bit odd to

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,280
do a director's commentary for them and I think they're just a lot less dense and intense

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,500
than the main CGP Grey animated stuff.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,680
So I think in general, if I'm doing stuff like this in the future, there probably won't

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:37,900
be a director's commentary, but this Ticoi project, boy, did it turn out to be a whole

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
thing.

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,620
So I figure there's at least a little mini director's commentary in this one.

21
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,020
Would you classify this video as one of your light grey videos?

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
No.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,740
I created on the channel this playlist in a category that I'm calling light grey.

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:03,420
That is for stuff that is really easy and is relatively unedited and unresearched.

25
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,860
So like the little video that I put up before this of just me driving the Tesla straight

26
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,140
into a bunch of tumbleweed that was like a cut scene, that's like a light grey video.

27
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,520
I think that sort of video can be kind of fun, but it's obviously not a main video or

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,160
like I did the explanation of the Supreme Court recently and for various reasons, like

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,560
that's a video that I could make without having to do a ton of research.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
It doesn't need to be as tightly edited.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
And so yeah, that's like a different category.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,080
You know what this is, I'm putting this under my playlist of like grey goes outside, which

33
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,200
really I could not have timed worse as a project I was really planning on doubling down this

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,800
year on with the global pandemic.

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,400
So this is obviously a project that's a little bit left over for that.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,600
But yeah, I had a whole bunch of things in mind for like grey goes outside as a concept

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,600
and the world had other ideas.

38
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,120
So that's the category this fits into and who knows how much stuff will appear on that

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,420
at any point in the future.

40
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,080
But that's the answer to your question of what do I consider this?

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,040
I consider this a grey goes outside video.

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,480
It's not a main video.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,360
It's not a light grey video.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
It's me being outside and exploring a place.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Yeah, the harbor master.

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,200
I could make a vlog taking out the trash and that is just about the most exciting outdoor

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
thing that I have done in several months.

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,280
So I hope everyone's doing all right.

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,480
So to give you a sense of this, I was talking to my assistant this morning and we were just

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,520
trying to trace back.

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,600
How long have we been working on this thing?

52
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,240
Because from our subjective experience, it feels like we have been working on Tico for

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,200
forever.

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,780
And the answer was the first correspondence between the two of us about this project goes

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,900
to May of last year.

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:10,100
That is more than a year ago when I first decided to bring someone in on this project

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,420
and then I don't know exactly how long before that I was working on this and sort of investigating

58
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,660
it as a possible thing.

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:26,220
But so yeah, May of last year is when this became like a real this looks like it's going

60
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,620
to happen project.

61
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,780
Still not as old as the Catan video.

62
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, yes, I mean technically that's correct, but the Catan video is not actively being

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,080
worked on the Ticoi project was actively worked on for the past year and a bunch of different

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
ways.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,600
But yeah, so it's just a very very long time ago and the way that this worked.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:01,160
I was going to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation for other reasons at that time and it just

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,540
so happened that I came across this what I thought was just an incidental piece of

68
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:15,860
information that oh the on this reservation there happens to be this I didn't even know

69
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,360
what it was exactly like old weapons facility or something like I it was extremely hard

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:30,140
to figure out at the time but I could see that they like had this place as or like this

71
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,520
facility existed on the reservation is the best way to put it in the process of going

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,000
out to Skull Valley and going to the reservation.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,380
I was able to get permission from the tribe to be able to go on to go on to Ticoi.

74
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
That's how this happens.

75
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,960
This is not a facility that you can just go visit like if anybody is out in the area like

76
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,920
don't drive down to Ticoi and just think you're going to see something you cannot go

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,380
on there.

78
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,740
They're not joking when they say that the area is patrolled.

79
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,980
It is also super dangerous like if people don't know that you're there it's not a it's

80
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:24,420
not a good place like it is an abandoned old facility and given that there's a lot of underground

81
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:31,040
construction and a lot of this stuff are huge metal doors and all the rest of it like

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,900
it's not a place to just go wandering on your own like that's a bad idea if people don't

83
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,320
know that you're there.

84
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,240
It's sort of funny as a creator because when I made the first video where I showed me just

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,600
exploring Ticoi I thought that would be kind of clear when I showed people the opening

86
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,780
scene is oh I'm unlocking the gates with this key and I figured like this is a clear

87
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,100
enough indication that I have permission to be here and this is not a place that you should

88
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:06,600
go there's a there's a lock and I am unlocking it and then at the end you know I'm closing

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,940
it back up but boy did I get a lot of comments from people about how did you go there like

90
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,040
people wanting to visit it themselves.

91
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,420
So yeah I guess I guess I was a little bit wrong about how clear that message is of unlocking

92
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,040
the gate but yeah so I just just want to say like it's not a public place that that a person

93
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:34,020
can go visit I was able to get permission from the tribal leaders and I had to sign

94
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,500
a lot of waivers in order to be able to go there so that's the that's the behind the

95
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,100
scenes of of how did this actually come to happen.

96
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,480
Really getting this secluded office space that you want I actually had I actually had

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,680
a little line that I cut from the exploration video where there was a bunker that was way

98
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,080
off to the side of the facility that I thought oh this actually would be a really charming

99
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,120
writing space if I could just get some air conditioning down there like I would really

100
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,160
love this as an office that didn't make it into the the original exploration video.

101
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,300
Oh one more thing before I before I could hear one more thing about the exploration

102
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,760
video before I forget the other really minor thing which I just just want to make clear

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:25,600
and I wish I had thought to put it in the original video but I did not take the badge

104
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,520
that I lift off of the rack in the opening of the exploration video like that that was

105
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,860
a little bit of oh let me show you the badge and the idea was that oh like oh I need this

106
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,120
to be here right this is the badge for being a tikoy you don't go to a unique historical

107
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,620
site and just take yourself a bunch of souvenirs that you're never going to look at but I was

108
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,040
pretty surprised by how many people are like oh I've got to take one of those badges it's

109
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,580
like no no no no no that's not what these places are you know you leave them for the

110
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,400
next people who are going to be there or you leave them to be reconstructed and restored

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,260
in the future but yeah so that's one thing it didn't occur to me at the time that I needed

112
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,040
to film putting the badge back on the rack but I just I just didn't think about it and

113
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,220
yeah that was an interesting piece of feedback from people would I ever go to Chernobyl it's

114
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,340
an interesting question probably not I don't know what the background radiation is for

115
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:29,420
that place now like how dangerous that is compared to other things but I think my gut

116
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,420
reaction is Chernobyl to me is not interesting enough that I would want to increase my risk

117
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,620
of getting cancer by visiting it even if it's a relatively small amount okay were there

118
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,640
classified things Revolution Dudes is asking were there classified things you couldn't

119
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,420
show on camera so as best I could tell here's some paperwork everything that was left there

120
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,100
was not classified documents now of course I didn't read through every piece of paper

121
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,900
that was there but there was lots of stuff that had obviously been removed there was

122
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,580
nothing on site that was classified but this project was weird because it kept running

123
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,260
up against the I'll say it this way like the edges of classified things but maybe we can

124
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,860
maybe we can get to that a little bit later okay all right let me actually start this

125
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,140
thing is my theory is that I want to do a relatively short one of these just to prove

126
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,300
to myself that I can this is the ticoi test range or at least it once was the site is

127
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,100
long abandoned now but it once served a vital purpose oh okay I don't know okay this is

128
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,980
this is one of these things where as a creator you're really pleased with something but I

129
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,420
don't know if anybody notices or cares I spent a million years on this okay so this is footage

130
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,820
of footage of me on the facility and then I do this little just little fade transitions

131
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:03,940
look guys look we're going we're going back in time back in time to the 1980s and this

132
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:12,980
is footage from ticoi when it was in operation now I don't know okay I need to be here's

133
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:20,620
the thing I need to be a little bit careful about the way I say things because for this

134
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:30,100
project it was necessary to have like legal consultation for some parts of it and prior

135
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:37,340
to this video existing as far as me and my assistant were able to determine there was

136
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:45,380
absolutely no public footage available of ticoi in operation at the time like no video

137
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:55,400
no photographs but this piece of footage was acquired and is the debut of anyone being

138
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,860
able to see what the facility looked like when it was an operation and just by total

139
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:09,900
dumb luck I happen to film myself in one spot where whoever the camera operator was

140
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,500
what I what I think what I suspect happens is the camera was just misaligned it happened

141
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,220
to be pointing at the bunker and then the camera operator guy you know real real aligned

142
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,900
the camera to where it's supposed to be and started to zoom in on on one of the tests

143
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:33,900
so I feel like this is just a lucky accident from 30 years ago and a lucky accident from

144
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:39,260
me a year and a half ago filming this thing that I was able to able to transition back

145
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,180
and forth so I'm telling you all about this because I spent forever on it and I was really

146
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:53,380
I was really determined I'm like I am going to fit this transition in the video somewhere

147
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:02,420
if it kills me so there we go served a vital purpose a military purpose and the work done

148
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,620
at ticoi is still out in the world today constructed during the cold war at the entrance to the

149
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:16,820
facility is a warning sign in Russian so everybody asks what does the sign in Russian say and

150
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,580
what I've what I've been delighted by is some people in the exploration video went through

151
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,740
all of the trouble of trying to translate the sign like typing it into Google or using

152
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,100
like translation software on a screenshot or something what the sign in Russian says

153
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,860
is what this sign in English says right next to it this they are the same sign and it's

154
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,460
like the list of prohibited items that are not allowed on the site you know so hey you're

155
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:52,340
coming on to a missile motor test site please don't bring matches cigarette lighters other

156
00:13:52,340 --> 00:14:00,140
flame producing devices firearms ammunition drugs and intoxicants like those are the things

157
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:08,660
that you cannot bring on to a missile motor test site don't do that that's really bad

158
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,700
Russian but this is not the former Soviet Union this is the great state of Utah where

159
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,540
in skull intoxicants not allowed for Russians oh yeah I mean guys yes I know it says please

160
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,500
no cameras but it's not an operation anymore so it's okay I can bring the camera there

161
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,540
like I had permission it's all it's all totally fine so here's a map of Utah the geography

162
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:39,060
is that there are like four mountain ranges that cause three valleys and the easternmost

163
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,460
valley is where Salt Lake City is that's where like all the people live there's a valley

164
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:51,300
in the middle which is much less populated than the westernmost valley is is skull valley

165
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,820
which just has a tremendously awesome name and to the west here is the great Salt Lake

166
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:06,900
desert enormous and terrifying and yeah just an absolutely deadly deadly region skull valley

167
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:17,100
is extremely depopulated I think the reservation population is I mean I'd have to double check

168
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,720
the numbers but I want to say it can't be more than 40 or 50 people at most who are

169
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,820
living on the living on the reservation so it's it's a pretty it's pretty isolated area

170
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:39,620
but directly to the west the Salt Valley is used for a lot of weapons testing so any anyone

171
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:46,740
in Utah probably knows like this is the UTTR which is the Utah Utah test and training range

172
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,820
aircraft and bombs and other weapons are tested out there and I mean if the Salt Lake desert

173
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,620
is beautiful but it's also like if you got to pick a place in the continental United

174
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,780
States where you're going to test some weapons and nobody's going to notice or care it's probably

175
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:11,940
not a bad spot but it does it does leave skull valley like the first area where there is some

176
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,500
population right up against this and I think that's part of the reason why the ticoi test

177
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,660
facility was was put where it was because the missiles themselves are manufactured closer

178
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,500
to Salt Lake City but then skull valley is like within convenient striking distance of other

179
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,740
military other military facilities on the Great Salt Lake so just sort of was like a little spot

180
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,500
in the middle Lee ticoi resides much of what happened on site was classified and equipment

181
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,140
and documents were removed but what remains is enough to piece together the story of ticoi the

182
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,740
paperwork left behind bears the logo of Hercules incorporated Hercules got its start in the late

183
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,540
1800s with a patent improving on dynamite to the creator named Hercules powder and began

184
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,420
manufacturing the new explosive just outside of San Francisco in a company town that would outlive

185
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,180
the company Hercules California one of the difficult things in trying to put together

186
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:15,440
these videos is is trying to figure out what do you include what do you not include and a lot of

187
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,660
this Hercules stuff was really killing me so the video should be about ticoi right like I've put

188
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,700
up a video that it that shows the exploration of this place and now I should put up a video

189
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,900
that is the explanation of the place but I did get a little bit derailed by Hercules because in

190
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,140
order to try to figure out okay like what was this place the first thing that you need to figure out

191
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:45,540
is okay well who ran it and the answer is this this company called Hercules but just just like

192
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,140
with ticoi there was not a lot of information about Hercules that was public on the internet

193
00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:00,380
but was able to trace it back to this patent that we pulled from the patent office website

194
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,460
that started off like this company now there's there's a line here where I'm sort of glossing

195
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,500
over some of the details right where what do I say it's with a patent improving on it's got

196
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,020
it start in the late 1800 right so yeah so I say like Hercules got its start in the late 1800s I

197
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:26,740
tried not to dig into the details too much but it seems like this guy Joseph Willard he patented

198
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,220
Hercules powder it's this improvement on dynamite but he was working for DuPont at the time and

199
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:40,780
something happened within the company where eventually the United States government as part

200
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:48,220
of like trust busting and monopoly busting decided like DuPont was too big of a monopoly

201
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:56,980
on chemical productions and so I don't say that the company was like founded in the late 1800s

202
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,740
just that it got its start but the the United States government apparently came in and said

203
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,740
like DuPont you're too much of a monopoly we're gonna split you we're gonna split you into several

204
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:14,380
other companies and like DuPont obviously went on and became its own thing but Hercules became

205
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:21,020
a separate company and this patents for this particular kind of explosives was like the

206
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,860
foundation of what the business was in terms of intellectual property like okay you Hercules you

207
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:33,100
own this new explosive that's what you get DuPont you don't get this explosive you have to go make

208
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,780
baby powder and other things and I'd never heard of Hercules but it turns out that like from

209
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:48,900
starting as this you know making making better dynamite for farmers seemed like the primary use

210
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:57,940
in the late 1800s they exploded to become just an absolutely ginormous company and I kept having to

211
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,980
cut stuff about Hercules from the video because it really isn't about them but it blew my mind how

212
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:11,980
huge they were like they had dozens and dozens of production sites all over the US manufacturing

213
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,900
gunpowder and then later manufacturing intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles

214
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:24,540
it's just unreal they were involved in like every aspect of chemical production they did

215
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:35,100
petroleum they did turpentine like it's crazy how much they actually created and better better

216
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,580
dynamite for farmers to deal with the tumbleweeds yes I'm sure well we'll get we'll get to it in the

217
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,540
end but so anyway I spent forever like just trying to research this company be like what's the deal

218
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:53,180
and at one point I found what I thought like oh this is this is gonna be this is gonna be my

219
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,740
salvation this is now I'm gonna get all the answers that I want and my research is over so

220
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:08,140
let me let me find for you a little video to show you this is my desk here in my office so back when

221
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,060
the video had way more about Hercules than any normal person would care I thought I was going

222
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:19,100
to mention like the story of discovering this book but I ended up not doing that because nobody cares

223
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:30,180
but so this is as as far as I can tell this is like the canonical and maybe only book that exists

224
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:37,380
about the history of Hercules incorporated and it's huge it's and it's written by two guys who

225
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,820
it seems like this is what they do they like they just pick companies and go through and and write

226
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,620
these really detailed histories about it and so when I found this book I was just I was really

227
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:56,500
pumped and like yes I'm going to have all of the answers that I could ever possibly want and while

228
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:03,340
I read it and they did have a lot of interesting things about Hercules Ticoi is not even mentioned

229
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:11,460
in the book not once like it's not in the index it never ever appears anywhere in this book because

230
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,700
the company was so huge that Ticoi was just like an incidental little like nothing piece

231
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:24,300
of information compared to everything else that they were involved in I originally kind of thought

232
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,820
that would be a fun thing to mention like Oh Ticoi was so huge that the definitive book about the

233
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:37,260
company doesn't even mention Ticoi but it just like it just didn't work and then it also causes

234
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,380
like it's a little bit weird to cut away to my desk and and like later me showing you a book

235
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:51,900
it wasn't the point of that so I'm kind of showing you in the director's commentary but it was Gumbo

236
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,220
is asking how dry is the book like college textbook I guess I would I guess I would say

237
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:05,980
that you probably would want a reason to read the book would be the way I might want to phrase that

238
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,380
there are things that are like interesting if you've spent a year of your life trying to like

239
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:23,100
make a project about this weird abandoned facility but I would not put it on my list of like general

240
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:29,140
books to recommend for reading also I love there's like this picture here of this of this poor dude

241
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:36,420
on the bottom where they're like oh yeah here's a guy I don't remember where that plant is but

242
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:45,900
here's a guy his job is to transport nitroglycerin using this little like rickety looking baskets I

243
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,780
would not want to have to transport nitroglycerin using this thing and I say in the beginning of

244
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,100
the video that 60 people or about 60 people died in the manufacturing plant in California

245
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:06,020
I didn't say it clearly enough in the video because it really was just the people in that

246
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:13,460
plant in California there were plenty other of plenty other explosions nationwide related to

247
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:22,740
Hercules and all the various things that they did but yeah so anyway this book exists and yeah I

248
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,580
thought it was gonna be a gold mine that would solve all of my problems but nope did someone

249
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,700
post an Amazon link in the in the ghost chat hey if you know if you want to read it I'm not gonna

250
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,620
stop you oh yeah if you're totally right a plus on the book's name though labors of a modern

251
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,700
Hercules is an amazing title for that book like a plus oh I forgot to mention the other weird thing

252
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:59,340
about the book is it was written in like 1990 or 1989 and so at the very end there's mention of

253
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:06,540
how in the facility that I mentioned later West Baucus the author of the book saw all the Soviet

254
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,060
inspectors there as part of the facility and he's like oh what a what a new world we live in where

255
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:18,180
the Soviet Union is here at Hercules manufacturing facilities in the United States like how strange

256
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:25,700
is that and it was also super frustrating to me because since the book stopped in 89 or 90 all of

257
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:32,500
the questions I had about how this how this gigantic company went out of business like what

258
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,380
are the details none of those were present in the book because all of that happened like five years

259
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,980
later and there was a lot of digging around online to try to like answer that question more

260
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,420
precisely but again you have to realize at some point this isn't actually a video about the

261
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:56,900
company Hercules right I'm not adopting or I'm not adapting labors of a modern Hercules into a video

262
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:03,580
I'm supposed to be making a video about what this weird place called ticoi was so yeah this is this

263
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,380
is part of like the decisions that you have to make behind the scenes local products but their

264
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,740
smokeless gunpowder rapidly grew them to become a vital United States military supplier during the

265
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:20,180
world wars as the posters said Hercules men and women in the war keep them shooting I always love

266
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,700
these old war posters it's like these old propaganda posters they have such a distinct look

267
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,860
to them and it's like here's here's Uncle Sam he's trying to he's trying to raise money by selling

268
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,780
war bonds it's not clear in the video but the context of this is I think he's trying to guilt

269
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,900
the people who live in the factory town of Hercules like hey guys I know you're literally

270
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,660
manufacturing the bullets from my weapons but it's not enough you also have to buy Uncle Sam's war

271
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,100
bonds you come over to these so I found I found a few of these on the National Archives do I have

272
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:58,380
the other one so again I think these are like propaganda slash recruitment posters for Hercules

273
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:05,540
these were produced these are produced during the Second World War I find their messaging is like a

274
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:12,100
little mixed it's a little bit unclear like what they're what they're trying to what they're

275
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,540
trying to say here I'm glad of the chance to do something real while my husband's in the army and

276
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:28,020
say you know these machinists are swell that's like Sophie I like I get I feel like I get the

277
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,500
message but maybe there's there's like a better there's a better way to word this especially

278
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,780
because like these machinists are swell I'd like what do you what do you mean by that and it's you

279
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:46,860
know the I get to do something real it's just it's just odd it's odd messaging you know or like the

280
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,540
other guy over here he's putting in a full day every day at Hercules and he has to otherwise

281
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,020
he'd be letting down his kid who works in the parachute troops like you know that's a lot of

282
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,940
pressure yeah I don't know I just I find these kinds of things these sorts of posters really

283
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:10,060
interesting and there's one more can I pull it up yeah so here's the third one so this little logo

284
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:15,260
is is just pulled out from a third one that had a different color scheme which is which is this

285
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,620
guy he's talking to his he's talking to his buddies we may not be welding tanks but boy

286
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,740
we're keeping a Hercules plant running and that's something in this war it's just amazing it's a bit

287
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,460
like the old newsreels and propaganda videos where it's the same thing like there's something

288
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,780
earnest and deceptive about them at the same time Mary yeah posters were so wordy back then

289
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:47,220
yeah that's that's right people had more time to read posters back in in 1940 like what else

290
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,300
are you gonna do you don't have a smartphone to distract you you might as well read all the

291
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,540
propaganda posters being posted on the wall yeah no they look like they show up in a Fallout game

292
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,220
for sure cold war came next and brought with it a new weapon the intercontinental ballistic missile

293
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,980
tipped with a nuclear warhead now one country could destroy another remotely and the only

294
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:13,020
defense was a credible threat of retaliation this drew the United States and the Soviet Union into

295
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:20,540
an arms race I was working with the animator for a long time on this shot and the the sort of

296
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:27,140
inspiration and and the the design for this concept was a little bit of the the screens

297
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,300
in war games the movie all right so that like at the end there's all of these like these maps and

298
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,300
you're seeing all of the nuclear weapons spread on the maps you know and and that was kind of the

299
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,460
like the direction that I gave for this one is like what what it what if the you know the the

300
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:49,620
war game stuff like we're seeing it happen on an actual globe it's not happening on like on a

301
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,300
computer screen it states and the Soviet Union into an arms race building more and faster and

302
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,420
bigger nuclear weapons each year for the again this thing like the animator did the absolute

303
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:07,020
last minute just just today was animating in this graph which I just love I totally love the way it

304
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:13,940
looks like I love the cool smoky look and if it looks familiar this is the same effect that was

305
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,340
used on the time travel portal in the national popular interstate vote compact when gray goes

306
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,940
back in time there's like a blue smoky portal and that's the same effect that's being used on the

307
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,420
edge of the line up here United States this culminated with the Minuteman unlike earlier

308
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,220
missiles which had to be launched out in the open and were slow to fuel with liquid propellant the

309
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,820
Minuteman could be launched from an underground silo and thus be hidden in America's cornfields

310
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:46,100
the new solid fuel motors able to launch them instantly yeah so this is also I don't know how

311
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,700
clear this is to people like what what you're actually looking at here but it's really quite

312
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,420
shocking how open the United States is with some of the information about its nuclear weapons

313
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,740
program and you know one of the things that it's open about is is the location of some of these

314
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:09,300
nuclear silos but yeah if you like zoom in on Google Earth and you're looking around in a

315
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:16,460
northwestern Nebraska you can totally just find the nuclear silos if you know what you're looking

316
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:22,500
for this is a little hatch that opens up the Minuteman missile is underneath there's a little

317
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,780
bit of a entryway above ground for the military personnel to go into and and like the whole

318
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,900
facility is is under the ground here you know this is this is like unnamed country road number

319
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:41,860
four just going through a bunch of farmland but if you turn right at the correct moment it's like

320
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,500
oh and there is a Minuteman 3 nuclear missile underneath the ground right along the side there

321
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,260
it's crazy yes I know that you can tour some of these things another thing that has just is killed

322
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:00,260
it's killed me be that this there's like not being able to go outside thing is is heartbreaking

323
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,460
because yeah I know that there are places where you can tour some of these facilities that are

324
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:12,540
no longer active and this is a case where my original summer plans part of what I was going

325
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:19,180
to do was I wanted to wrap up this ticoi project by going back to Skull Valley and being able to

326
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:27,900
do a few more things like I wanted this project to be more of a thing than it ended up being but

327
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,740
the practicalities of it were just like look who knows when I'm going to be able to travel next

328
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:40,020
this project is already more than a year old I've got to wrap it up otherwise I am going to go crazy

329
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:48,340
but I would really have loved to be able to have made a trip to one of these silos that you can see

330
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:54,140
in person but that was not in the cards for this year so maybe it'll have to be a future episode

331
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,820
of Grey Goes Outside but we harvest corn here corn and nukes yeah that feels again very very

332
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,140
American like what a week what do we grow we grow nuclear weapons and we grow corn oh I have to I

333
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,340
have to show you like can I find it really quickly though but again some of these old videos about

334
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:19,420
like how the how the weapons work are totally crazy pants okay all right so this I just love

335
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:26,100
it this is this is the like the glory of America all right the minute man is ready primed in the

336
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,980
earth beneath its hardened blast-proof cap in the vast open lands of America from the

337
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:41,980
grasses of Wyoming to the North Dakota plains from the North Dakota standing guard amidst the

338
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:50,140
old ports silent sentinels of freedom on strategic alert in the defense of America

339
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:04,180
I just love it like it's amazing right they're like oh we have these nuclear weapons that can

340
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:10,180
fly out of the ground but like what are they doing they're protecting our beautiful grasslands and

341
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:16,780
and like oh there's silent sentinels in the ground we've got children with ponies to protect and we

342
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:25,100
need nuclear weapons it's amazing these things are totally they're totally unreal there's one

343
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,740
I don't know if I can find it really quick the reason I have these these videos that loaded up

344
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:38,500
in Final Cut I had a I had a brief cut of this project where I included I included some of this

345
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:45,020
footage but I decided like it just didn't fit tonally I wanted this to be just like okay I went

346
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,300
to this place and now I'm going to explain to you what it was and it was a little bit weird to cut

347
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:56,100
sometimes to this old like propaganda footage and then to cut back but I really did I really did

348
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,500
greatly enjoy producing some of this stuff so is this the it's this video where the narrator is

349
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,140
like really passive-aggressive about the Soviet Union and like America has to protect the world

350
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,220
and the Soviet Union doesn't I think it's this part all of these various projects while perhaps

351
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:19,260
not sufficiently emphasized in light of today's events did help the Air Force to understand the

352
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:25,860
problems of pilotless missiles and to begin to build its operational force Russia in the meantime

353
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:34,620
not hampered by having to police the world that's what it is right they're like we're working on our

354
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,380
missiles program Russia meanwhile like they get to just be the baddies because they don't have to

355
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,760
police the world it's amazing Russia in the meantime not hampered by having to police the

356
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,880
world concentrate on whatever weapon of war she desired since Russia did not have to worry about

357
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
aggressive attack from the free world she could jump ahead and develop weapons of the future at

358
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,680
her discretion this is we now know she did this is amazing right like because we're the goodies

359
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,080
like she didn't have to worry about us attacking them so they so like she got to make all the evil

360
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:16,360
weapons that she wanted which is such a weird like it's such a weird way to explain this

361
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:22,480
situation plus like given contemporary documents we now have of like what was going on at the time

362
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,280
we totally know that Russia was like their number one concern was like the rest of the world was

363
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,260
going to invade them at any moment but this propaganda film portrays it like oh the Soviet

364
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:39,000
Union knew that like the good guys would never attack them and so they just went on to build a

365
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,080
bunch of nuclear weapons because they're evil unlike our nuclear weapons which we're building

366
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:50,000
because we're policing the world it's just amazing you know what no I've got to I've got to stop well

367
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:59,360
just okay one more this gleaming metallic instrument is being developed in a race against time the Air

368
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:07,120
Force plans to win by taking calculated risks based on sound technical judgment only once

369
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,000
before in the Manhattan Project has this nation taken a comparable gamble of such billion dollar

370
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,920
immensity that time the stake was atomic energy to stop a war this time we aim for a ballistic

371
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:30,480
missile force to keep the peace yeah we're gonna keep that peace we're gonna keep it it's amazing

372
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:38,400
you know it's just like this gleaming weapon this is this is ours right there's bad things

373
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,760
happening in the world but this is these are these are ballistic weapons to keep the peace

374
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,040
like I just love the way it's presented you know I mean like you can totally have a conversation

375
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,640
that's reasonable and about like what safety do nuclear weapons provide and like the game

376
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,080
theoretical logic of mutually assured just like you can have this conversation and you can be on

377
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,960
either side of like does this makes does this make people safe does it not make people like

378
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,840
there's an adult conversation to be had there but this is just like hilarious propaganda for

379
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,160
children yes that's right lizard heart that's exactly right it's like the beautiful good

380
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,960
nuclear weapons versus the evil nuclear weapons also I don't know if you noticed but like whoever

381
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:31,400
made this film I totally love you know this is like 1950s Final Cut editor but you notice how

382
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,240
like the America stuff is all blue and beautiful and Russia is evil and red right it's like look

383
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,200
at our beautiful blue bombers like look at this evil Soviet Union it's hilarious okay all right

384
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm getting distracted I'm sorry okay here we go launched out in the open and we're slow to fuel

385
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,240
with liquid propellant the Minuteman could be launched from an underground silo and thus be

386
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,000
hidden in America's cornfields the new solid fuel motors able to launch them instantly the

387
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,320
United States ordered 1,000 Minuteman missiles to be constructed which brings us back to Hercules

388
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,560
and ticoi for as a bullet in a round needs powder to hit a target so too does the nuclear warhead in

389
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,520
a Minuteman missile need its solid fuel motor I don't think this quite worked in the video I was

390
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,000
trying to draw this analogy like if I was going to spend an infinite amount of time rewriting it

391
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,560
I feel like I would have wanted to draw this analogy more closely that Hercules got their

392
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,480
start manufacturing this smokeless gunpowder that's like really what gave them their start

393
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,280
now in in the time that we're talking about like what was ticoi they're manufacturing the like

394
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,600
gunpowder equivalent of an ICBM but I don't think it quite came across right and again that this is

395
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,440
where you have to you have to put limits on how much you're going to rewrite things or rerecord

396
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,680
things or try to make stuff like perfectly fit together I also feel like this is a little bit

397
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:06,160
of a probably for most viewers of the channel like again doing the director's commentaries

398
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,080
right after I don't know how people are reacting but I wouldn't be surprised if this is a video

399
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,600
that a lot of people think is kind of boring so you know I've already spent probably way more

400
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,800
time on this than makes any kind of economic sense but I did get I did get a little bit obsessed with

401
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,420
it need its solid fuel motor Hercules manufactured the motors at a plant called Bacchus West in Magna

402
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,160
Utah and brought them to ticoi for testing the large concrete cubes still here are thrust blocks

403
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,160
their purpose to be an immovable object for a missile motor to push against during test firing

404
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,400
each motor needed to be individually calibrated hitting a target a quarter of the world away while

405
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:55,080
traveling at mach 20 is a precise affair excellent work by the animator to do the ICBM here and even

406
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,180
when I was just sent the like the really rough version of it like here's the outline of what we

407
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,720
want I think it really is kind of shocking to see how it motor works you know okay there's a

408
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,220
missile that goes up in into the sky and then it turns around and it comes back down but I really

409
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:22,180
do think there's something quite visceral about seeing what is basically a parabolic arc right

410
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,020
that people like you intrinsically know from things like throwing a baseball or whatever and

411
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:33,580
the way the animation is of the actual warheads coming down like I think it it's really quite a

412
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,820
striking piece of animation like it's it's it's incredibly well done you know it's not the whole

413
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,380
missile that comes down and and strikes I think that's a bit of a misconception that people have

414
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:49,620
that it's like the missile hits but it really is just this tiny payload at the very end which are

415
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:57,980
the warheads and the intercontinental ballistic missile can have many warheads and I think the

416
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:05,020
the early Minutemen had two later versions had three and I don't know I don't know what the

417
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,860
what the current state of technology is for warhead miniaturization but yeah I think it really is

418
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,900
quite striking just to see the like the simplicity of it thrust block technicians would connect

419
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,860
to measure heat and pressure and those sensors connected via underground cables to instrument

420
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:26,220
bunkers where engineers would record the results with state-of-the-art 1970s computer assistants

421
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,740
set up for each test could take a week or more so the motor and engineers and equipment had to be

422
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,860
protected from the elements but a missile can't be fired inside a building without melting the

423
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:42,320
structure around it and invalidating the test to solve so this is this is finally the part of the

424
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:51,800
video where I actually get to kind of explain like much more what ticoi is and again part of

425
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,840
the reason why I had such a hard time finishing up this project is like my original vision was I

426
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:05,000
never intended for there to be two videos I wanted for there to be one video that was both the

427
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,400
exploration and the explanation at the same time that was the original idea but when I was making

428
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,920
the first exploration video just the fact of the matter was there is absolutely nothing available

429
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,400
that could show what did this facility look like you know it was a classified facility and many of

430
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,600
the things related to it are still classified today and so I ended up having to just make the

431
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:40,960
first video a pure explanation one and kind of putting out a little call for like hey if you

432
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,360
know anything get in touch in the end I actually feel like it worked better as two parts I like

433
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,180
having the explanation and the exploration separate but I had originally thought when I

434
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,920
put up the exploration video I was like oh I'll have the explanation done in in two weeks I'm

435
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,800
gonna I'm gonna wrap this up real quick but meanwhile like two months of very solid work

436
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,760
later it's it's finally actually done but it is very surreal personally for me to see like oh

437
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:19,160
here's this footage of me in this location and then to see test footage from the time of like oh

438
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,880
I know exactly which thrust block that is you know there's three thrust blocks on site and this is

439
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:32,040
the big one that was at the you know the far end of the facility so it's it's a it's a strange

440
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:39,120
experience personally let's go let's move on to the exciting parts solve this the buildings at

441
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,240
ticoi were constructed on rails so they could be pulled back before firing and also give the

442
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,080
nearby camera houses a clear view of the test this will be the fine of d5 second stage at 5b

443
00:44:51,080 --> 00:45:06,480
250 minus ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero we have ignition Hercules did

444
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,440
improve thanks chat I'm glad the chat seems to agree that they like the the two parts that it

445
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:19,320
worked yeah I do think in the end it works better than my original idea I just you know I just never

446
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,920
expected it to take this long or to be this much work as always is the case I think oh I'm at the

447
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,040
Skull Valley Reservation working on what is the the main project and this and this will be just a

448
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:39,120
fun little diversion this this will be just like a oh look what a what a little a small fractal

449
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,280
shard that I can pick up and just easily turn into a fun video about what this place is it's

450
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:53,000
fast-forward a year and several months later and it's finally done okay so here here is where we

451
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,680
get the actual labeling of the facility so yeah this this is like where it comes together you

452
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,760
can see what all the different parts are you have that the test site which is in the building on

453
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,640
rails the thrust block is inside that building if the instrumentation bunker there are three camera

454
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,280
houses there's another one which is being hidden by the building itself and then the lightning rods

455
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,360
that are around it to divert the lightning strikes and I feel like I'm incredibly lucky that there

456
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:29,200
was an oncoming storm when I happened to be filming this you're glad the storm was correctly

457
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,800
labeled do you like I spent a long time trying to figure out if I could put an arrow to point

458
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,120
to the storm but it just didn't work so I ended up going with like a little label just like I can

459
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:45,420
label the whole background okay killed a t-coin oh right so yeah here we get to serious part

460
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:52,360
explosions nonetheless one man was killed a t-coin in 1984 crushed beneath a motor that came loose

461
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,360
during securement to the test block an accident for which the United States Occupational Safety

462
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:04,280
and Health Administration find Hercules 640 doll I had to kind of have my assistant just sanity

463
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,800
check me on this one of like does this report really say six hundred and forty dollars like

464
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:16,760
is that actually is that actually correct you know and and you can you can look up this accident

465
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:25,000
reports on on OSHA there's a description at the bottom which is you know it's a it's a little

466
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,640
difficult to understand I feel like if a man died on a facility like maybe you could include

467
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:41,480
a diagram not just a bunch of all caps sentences with tech jargon but yeah he was crushed to death

468
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:48,880
underneath the missile motor when it came loose and yeah I cannot believe that the penalty was

469
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:56,640
six hundred and forty dollars you know even if you do inflation from like 1984 dollars to now

470
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,520
that's not enough dollars but the thing is like right it's six hundred and forty dollars but

471
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:08,720
that's infinity more dollars than all of the people who died in the explosions in the original plant

472
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:17,720
in California or all the stuff before OSHA existed so I guess like this is an improved upward trend

473
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,360
but it was still really is really quite shocking to come across this as as part of the research

474
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,360
dollars the end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules the United States had

475
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,480
been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them ticoy was used

476
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,880
less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up leading

477
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,320
to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s what I'm saying right here about ticoy became a storage

478
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,560
facility I think this is also part of the reason going back to the very beginning why by the time

479
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,760
I get there it's you know where it's been abandoned for a long time there's not much

480
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,360
confidentiality there's not much confidential equipment left on site or like those things had

481
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:09,360
already started to be removed it seems like you know by the mid 1990s or so that that the ticoy

482
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,240
facility was already on the way down though the United States no longer needed the facility for

483
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,560
strategic production it was still strategically useful in a different way politics in 1991 the

484
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,480
United States and the Soviet Union signed start the strategic arms reduction treaty where both

485
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,600
agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles because of course neither country

486
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,400
was just going to take the word of the other numerous trust but verify policies were put into

487
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,640
place for example both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the others

488
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,200
satellites to see this little detail it doesn't really belong in this story of of ticoy but I

489
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:54,400
found this too fascinating not to include and I can't I can't imagine ever coming across this in

490
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,600
a video again as a place to mention it but there's something really that I find quite amazing about

491
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:07,280
these photographs of bombers and it was it was in the treaty that they had to be like all the tail

492
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,960
fins had to be cut off and they were literally left out just out in the open so that the spy

493
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,120
satellites from the other country would be able to see them and to confirm that they had been

494
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:29,760
dismantled it's an interesting question about trying to disarm and I mean we'll get to the

495
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,360
inspectors in just a second but it is a it's a weird thing when you think about it like how do

496
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:44,400
you try to let someone else know that you actually have disarmed and that you haven't like hidden a

497
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,240
bunch of bombers somewhere else that they don't know about it's a it's a difficult question and

498
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,280
this is this is one of oops this is one of the mechanisms that they tried to come up with and

499
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,080
presumably because like each of these are just so expensive to make that even if you were like

500
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:08,000
hiding bombers you're still incurring such a tremendous cost on yourself by destroying a

501
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,560
bunch of these things. Gombos to answer the question how long were they left there I don't

502
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,760
remember I do I know I came across it in the treaty at some point that they had to be left

503
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,000
out for a certain period of time but I don't I don't remember offhand I don't remember offhand

504
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,280
what that was there and nothing a bit of shiny tape couldn't fix I would not want to fly in a

505
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:38,560
plane where where they had welded the the tail fin back on no thank you. The open for the others

506
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,800
satellites to see and each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect the

507
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,240
United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets one of which was the

508
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:55,880
ticoi test ring this is also where to go back to the book from before where is it so on this list

509
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:04,680
you can see that a couple of the other test sites Hercules plant number one Magna Utah and I forget

510
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,880
somewhere else somewhere else on here is another Hercules plant but I think the Hercules plant in

511
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:17,760
Magna Utah is the the one where they were building the motors and this is the one that the authors of

512
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,840
labor of a modern Hercules were observing and where they saw the Soviet inspectors as part of

513
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:28,520
that process is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance temporary housing for the inspection

514
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,600
team was built in the Soviet Union to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls

515
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,200
or tampered with the equipment and transported to Utah forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna the

516
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,280
flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved and inspection duties fell to the

517
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:53,560
Russian Federation these bunkers okay you know what let me get to the end of the video but don't

518
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,840
let me forget about the bunkers because I have a bunch of things to say at the bunkers but let's

519
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:05,240
just let's let's finish this off Russian Federation ticoi limped on during the inspection period but

520
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,160
in 1995 with too many cancelled contracts the now failing Hercules incorporated put itself up for

521
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:18,040
sale acquired by Alliant tech systems and American aerospace defense and sporting goods company okay

522
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,440
yeah so that's not that's not like a joke as far as I can tell Alliant tech systems really does

523
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,960
make military gear and sporting equipment which I guess kind of makes sense like I didn't look into

524
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,720
it too far but maybe that stuff like paintball guns and body pads like I have I have no idea and

525
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:44,200
again you can't research absolutely everything but someone had asked the question earlier about

526
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:51,520
Hercules going bankrupt or going out of business I should say they didn't go bankrupt they sold

527
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:59,440
themselves off and yeah I found it kind of frustrating because I wanted to know more of

528
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:06,520
the details about like how does this happen how does a company that is a major supplier to the

529
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:14,720
US military go out of business and you know there weren't great answers like we were able to find a

530
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,360
bunch of articles at the time but they would all just like say these vague things about cancelled

531
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:27,720
contracts so I don't have a good answer but I do find it interesting like how enormous companies

532
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,480
can just disappear and so I kind of guess or presume that with Hercules it's the same way

533
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:40,640
that it goes with a lot of other big companies that they they end up acquiring a lot of fixed

534
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:47,760
costs over time and then if the market just slightly changes like they're left with a huge

535
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,720
number of fixed costs and it's hard to be profitable that's what puts them in trouble

536
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:58,880
and they end up going bankrupt or as Hercules did selling themselves off I didn't mention it

537
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,760
in the video but Hercules split into two and they sold all of the missile stuff to Alliant

538
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:15,360
tech systems the actual Hercules company existed for I can't remember I think until like 2004 and

539
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,480
then the rest of the company got bought by someone else and I don't remember off the top of my head

540
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:26,320
who that was but but this is again where you have to make a decision in a video and it's like does

541
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,600
it matter that not all of Hercules was sold off in this moment probably not we can just sort of

542
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,720
simplify that and say like Hercules was sold off even though part of it continued to exist but yeah

543
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:42,760
I I really wish that labors of a modern Hercules had been written six years later it could have

544
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,560
covered the details of how did this actually disappear but you know what even if it had been

545
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,200
written later without a doubt I would have read it found it interesting and probably written a

546
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,680
similar sentence that just kind of glosses over quickly like what what is that that happened I

547
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,520
included this this was like one of the few things I could find for Alliant tech systems at the time

548
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,880
but I love this image that they had on their website of like Alliant tech systems we make

549
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:15,480
rockets and guns and it's just you know America has a very America culture that I can't help but

550
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:22,320
love right like it's it's like ridiculous and awesome at the same time right it's it's like

551
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:28,840
it's why it's often parodied in like the Fallout games and that kind of stuff is is there's there

552
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:36,400
is a sort of ridiculous and awesome like don't tread on me American s and it definitely comes

553
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,560
definitely comes through sometimes American aerospace defense and sporting goods company

554
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,860
in 1999 the lease on this land expired Alliant tech systems did not renew and control of the

555
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:53,560
Ticoi test range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation within the borders of which

556
00:56:53,560 --> 00:57:01,080
Ticoi sits I know what I'm doing here and I I intentionally did want to wait the whole video

557
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:07,560
before mentioning that this is actually on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation because it because

558
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:13,840
I do think there's there's not a small number of viewers who were paying attention and who

559
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,640
even if they're not watching the directors commentaries they're like they're not watching

560
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,280
the behind-the-scenes stuff I imagine for a lot of viewers this is like the lightbulb moment that

561
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:30,760
explains oh this is what all like this nonsense has been with these two videos that gray made like

562
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,280
why did he make this video where he just walks around an abandoned place why is he telling me

563
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:42,280
about a bunch of Cold War nonsense that I don't care about oh he was out there for the Indian

564
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,960
reservations and like all of this is just a fractal off of that again for me as a viewer

565
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:55,320
you know the kinds of things that I watch I like those moments like I really appreciate when a

566
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:02,960
creator sort of lets you in on like hey you're a viewer who pays attention this is a detail that I

567
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,800
know you will love and will make it feel like the puzzle pieces have come together so it is part of

568
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,000
the reason why like on the earlier maps or in the beginning of the video I don't say it first hey

569
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,080
this is on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation I wait until the last possible second to mention

570
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:31,600
it and links yes you're totally right one of my favorite things about driving out west is these

571
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:40,240
Buffalo crossing signs like they are amazing and I mean you know I can't say I can't say too much

572
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:46,880
but the the Skull Valley go shoot Indian tribe they do have a pack of Buffalo we'll leave it at

573
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,340
that it operates no more its work lives on of the 1,000 minute man missiles constructed during the

574
00:58:53,340 --> 00:59:00,400
Cold War 400 are still active waiting with their solid fuel motors calibrated here at Ticoi to

575
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:09,640
launch at a moment's notice so I don't know how surprising that end is for people I think I don't

576
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,840
know for me before going out to Ticoi and before reading about any of this stuff there's a there's

577
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:25,680
a way in which I tend to think of the Cold War as oh the the Cold War is over like it's a thing

578
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:35,800
that happened a long time ago and is is totally irrelevant and while that is true with almost all

579
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:41,760
of history and almost all of wars there is a way in which I think the Cold War is is different

580
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:50,440
because a lot of the stuff that was made during the Cold War is still sitting around waiting to

581
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:58,200
destroy the world and that's that's part of what's going on with this Ticoi project is like I mean

582
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:07,000
yeah this is all like ancient history you know this this facility was built and operated before

583
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,920
I was born it's definitely built and operated before almost everyone watching this video was

584
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:23,040
born and and shut down before a lot of those viewers were born but unlike most of the boring

585
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,680
history stuff it's like yeah but the missile motors that pass through here are still sitting

586
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:37,480
in bunkers out in cornfields all over America just like waiting to go off and yeah it's it's

587
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,240
just weird and uncomfortable to think about yeah it's just uncomfortable to think about

588
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:52,200
that is the ending of the Ticoi video and a project that I felt like was was never going

589
01:00:52,200 --> 01:01:01,040
to end in my life yeah some some projects they take a long time some projects they really feel

590
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:10,760
like they take a long time and for sure the the Ticoi project it felt like the long project that

591
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:17,600
was this one I feel like it just it took a little bit took a little bit too long for me to actually

592
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:26,360
bring it to the wraps Oh Oh Florence thank you so much bunkers I almost forgot okay I and and I

593
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,560
can't believe I almost forgot because this is the thing that I was the most obsessed about okay

594
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:37,480
bunkers bunkers bunkers how do I how do I even know how to begin with this okay so at some point

595
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:45,840
in researching this project I came across this incidental piece of information that like oh hey

596
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:51,240
all of these inspection sites right if you look at the inspection list you'll see there's a ton

597
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:57,920
of stuff in Utah it's like oh the UTTR is out there the the Dugway Proving Ground is out there

598
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,320
there's like a lot of military stuff out there and the United States as part of SALT and START

599
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:09,920
treaties invited the Soviet Union to come out and inspect them and it's like okay what are you

600
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,480
gonna do with these Soviet inspectors you got to put them somewhere and the Soviet Union built

601
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:23,760
housing that it's sent to the United States for their inspectors to live in because they were

602
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:30,680
paranoid about the US spying on their inspectors they were paranoid about the equipment being

603
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:40,080
messed with and apparently they were also paranoid enough that they had sanitize its electrical

604
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,880
separation between the power supply and the bunker where you're like smoothing out the electrical

605
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:52,560
signal like the Soviets did not do not trust the United States very much so I do not know why but

606
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:59,240
I became really obsessed with these bunkers because wherever I initially found out this

607
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,120
piece of information it was like this casual off-handed thing that said like oh by the way

608
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:13,440
these bunkers still exist I was like oh really that's interesting the bunkers still exist

609
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,960
somewhere and this is also where the global pandemic was incredibly frustrating because

610
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:28,600
if that had not been happening 100% I would have flown back to Utah to find these bunkers

611
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:37,960
so this project ended up having to be done entirely online and I cannot cannot give enough

612
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:49,160
credit to my assistant who just did did a herculean amount of work to track down where these

613
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:58,000
bunkers were and to to get the photographs that you're seeing now like phone calls over the course

614
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:06,880
of a year to many military installations and Utah research installations and like yeah just

615
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:15,320
a tremendous amount of work the number of human hours on this is unbelievable I don't know if I'm

616
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,880
gonna be able to find this just off the top of my head yes thank you guys for congratulating my

617
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,520
assistant here you know one of the things with patreon like obviously you're supporting me

618
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,600
writing and researching the videos and obviously you're supporting the animator and like the music

619
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:36,120
and everything else my assistant does a tremendous amount of additional work like helping these

620
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:45,560
things to happen and like the whole ticoi project getting in touch with the skull Valley reservation

621
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,800
and like getting permission to be on ticoi like that never would have happened without

622
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:57,120
her being able to take lead on that project and so like yes there's many things many things that

623
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:07,520
that happen because of her so okay so where are we here okay so this is Utah so you've got Salt

624
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:13,960
Lake City is over here skull Valley is over here we've got the giant desert so originally the

625
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,600
inspectors were all in magna Utah which is sort of right by West Valley City it's over here for

626
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:28,800
reasons that I cannot remember off the top of my head the bunkers after the Soviet Union collapsed

627
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:36,000
the Russian Federation was inspecting for a while and then the start treaty came to an end and the

628
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:44,360
bunkers were vacated and they ended up all the way on the other side of the Salt Lake Desert in

629
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:54,520
Wendover so Wendover is this little town that's right on the Utah Nevada border they were slash

630
01:05:54,520 --> 01:06:02,480
are a Air Force Base kind of town the historic Wendover Airfield Museum is the place where it

631
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:12,160
was reported that these trailers ended up but I was determined to try to find out like for real

632
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:21,040
where are these things and if you now am I going to be able to do it just from memory okay here we

633
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:30,400
go boom okay so we went on a Google Street View and right outside the Historical Society in this

634
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:38,080
town you can see that there are a bunch of bunkers we eventually were able to get it confirmed that

635
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:46,160
yes this is where the bunkers that the Soviet inspectors used ended up and so there's I think

636
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:54,840
there's three or four of them that are in this this place and again through tremendous tremendous

637
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:03,400
effort we were able to get some photographs of the things so hold on let me pull this up okay so I

638
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:09,120
mentioned before like there was just nothing that existed that existed publicly about what did

639
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:16,280
t-coi look when it was being operated and it was a very similar situation for these Soviet trailers

640
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:23,000
like come on guys there's got to be pictures of this at the time and again what my assistant was

641
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:30,320
able to do with just an ungodly number of hours spent on the project was eventually tracked down

642
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:42,400
some boxes that were at the Utah State Archives and these boxes did not have date labels on them

643
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:50,680
they were like boxes of photographs from Magna Utah around this time like none of the photographs

644
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:57,680
are labeled they're not ordered there's no information on them but she was able to convince

645
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:06,280
one of the researchers there to scan some of the photographs for us that looked promising that they

646
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:13,320
might be bunker photos from the time and then we were able to by looking at the outsides confirm

647
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:19,280
like yes some of these are totally the Soviet bunkers these are the photographs from the inside

648
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:24,400
this is the one that I've used in the video but some of these photos are a little mysterious so

649
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,000
like this looks like it's the inside of one of the bunkers it was with the other bunker photos

650
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,960
it who knows like what's the deal where is this photograph taken is this is this when it was

651
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:44,360
constructed in in the Soviet Union is this in America like who knows there's just a bunch of

652
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:50,880
photos of like inspectors you can totally see like this is definitely out in Utah here's inspectors

653
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:57,120
investigating like a housing for one of the missiles guys hanging out like having a little

654
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:04,040
picnic it took forever to try to find these photos and this was like you know I don't know if you've

655
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:11,800
ever worked on a really long research project but we were so pumped when we finally were able to get

656
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:18,520
some of these photos and it's like excited all out of perspective with like what these images

657
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:25,480
actually are but to have been tracking them down for so long to actually get your hands on

658
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:33,040
something that was like in a box in an archive somewhere undated it was it was just it was just

659
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:39,120
incredible if I can get the other one so this is the other thing that I then really like so in

660
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:45,920
addition to tracking down like what were the archival images we were also able to get the

661
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:53,680
Wendover Historical Society to go inside these bunkers that had been like untouched on their

662
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:00,000
grounds in decades and just take some pictures from the inside of like what do these things

663
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,440
actually look like and so here is the state of the bunkers today and so you can see like this is

664
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:13,720
this is what's left inside there's the sign in Russian here is again like some of the old

665
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:19,600
equipment and the desks that they they sat at like again just equipment that's left inside

666
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:29,560
they're in really rough shape as you can see but like this is this is what's left of these bunkers

667
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,880
and here's what it looks like from the outside this is what from like a month ago I guess this

668
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,600
photograph and this this was really amazing because again if the pandemic had not been occurring I

669
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:47,000
would have flown to Wendover to try to like talk my way into these things but because that that

670
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,560
wasn't possible you know my my assistant was able to do the next best thing and like get the

671
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:01,080
Historical Society to take some photographs of what they look like I really really wanted to

672
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:08,920
work these into the video after so much effort trying to find them but here's the thing like

673
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:16,280
what is the video about the video is not about these trailers they're not really part of this

674
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:23,880
they're like an incidental part of the story it only loosely connects because they were in Magna

675
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:30,680
and Magna is also where the missiles were manufactured by Hercules and and so by the

676
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:37,080
time that I mentioned the bunkers we're already really at the end of the video and so to have a

677
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,720
little diversion about like oh these bunkers still exist today and here's some photos of

678
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:47,720
them like I just could not make it work in the actual video but I just really wanted to show

679
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:55,160
everyone who crowdfunds like look at these pictures we found isn't it amazing it was

680
01:11:55,160 --> 01:12:03,320
incredibly exciting to find them and and so much so that I want to thank everyone who crowdfunds

681
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:12,360
the channel because what we're doing is we are donating to the Wendover Historical Society

682
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:19,960
to get one of these bunkers restored we are donating to them so that they can actually

683
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,680
turn one of these things into the best restoration of what it was at the time

684
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:32,840
that's possible perhaps someday when the global pandemic is over if you happen to find yourself

685
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:41,160
traveling through Wendover and you want to make a little diversion there will be a restored soviet

686
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:50,840
cold war inspection bunker related to the crazy ticoi project out there to see so thank you all

687
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:59,320
of the crowdfunders for making these sorts of videos possible and thank you for letting us

688
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:06,760
help try to restore something in the real world that's actually related to one of these projects

689
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:16,760
it's it's this one has been a real real journey guys so thank you so much that is the end of the

690
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:24,760
short director's commentary for the evening and stay safe and I'll see you in the next one

691
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,820
you
