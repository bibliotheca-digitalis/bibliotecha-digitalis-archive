Good morning internet. Today is a day I thought would take many years to arrive and never have I been happier to be wrong.

00:07.180 --> 00:12.360
Today is my COVID vaccination day and I'm heading over to my appointment

00:12.400 --> 00:17.120
which just so happens to be at the coolest place to get a vaccination ever.

00:18.640 --> 00:26.040
Beautiful! What a beautiful London day to start the potential of a summer with travel.

00:30.140 --> 00:34.140
All good.

00:34.140 --> 01:03.020
Okay, now just to find a spot to park.

01:03.020 --> 01:12.740
It's surreal that this is finally going to happen, but if there's one place that's going

01:12.740 --> 01:17.620
to be filled with unvaccinated people, it's a huge vaccine center.

01:17.620 --> 01:21.900
So, time to gear up before going in.

01:21.900 --> 01:28.380
Suited up and super pumped to get my vaccine at the coolest place in the city to do so.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.020
The Science Museum.

01:30.020 --> 01:41.660
All right, here we go.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.140
It seems like you have potential for a lot more capacity than there is today.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.140
That's too nice.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.140
Hello.

01:47.140 --> 01:51.340
Could I have you a booking reference, please?

01:51.340 --> 01:52.340
Hi.

01:52.340 --> 01:53.340
How are you?

01:53.340 --> 01:54.340
I'm all right.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.340
How are you?

01:55.340 --> 01:56.340
Cheers.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.340
That's it?

01:57.340 --> 01:58.340
Yay, really good.

01:58.340 --> 01:59.340
Oh man, thank you so much.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.080
Oh, that was it.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
So fast.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.080
Oh wow.

02:04.080 --> 02:10.760
The exit takes you right into the museum.

02:10.760 --> 02:11.980
This is quite a trip.

02:11.980 --> 02:20.340
I haven't been anywhere inside like this for a year.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.340
Wow.

02:22.340 --> 02:27.880
All right, no need to push it though.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.360
Time to go home.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.120
Thank you for having me.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.600
If you want a shot, the Science Museum's got slots.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.800
It's amazing to finally have this done.

02:37.800 --> 02:45.200
Thank you to the literally thousands of scientists and medical personnel and logistics personnel,

02:45.200 --> 02:53.740
all of whom worked together to make today happen and to make this possible.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.840
Life already feels so different.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.680
It's time to get back to the world.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.800
I'll see you soon, internet.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.340
Bye.
