00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,860
Good morning internet. Today is a day I thought would take many years to arrive and never have I been happier to be wrong.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,360
Today is my COVID vaccination day and I'm heading over to my appointment

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,120
which just so happens to be at the coolest place to get a vaccination ever.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,040
Beautiful! What a beautiful London day to start the potential of a summer with travel.

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,140
All good.

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:01:03,020
Okay, now just to find a spot to park.

7
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:12,740
It's surreal that this is finally going to happen, but if there's one place that's going

8
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,620
to be filled with unvaccinated people, it's a huge vaccine center.

9
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,900
So, time to gear up before going in.

10
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,380
Suited up and super pumped to get my vaccine at the coolest place in the city to do so.

11
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,020
The Science Museum.

12
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:41,660
All right, here we go.

13
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,140
It seems like you have potential for a lot more capacity than there is today.

14
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
That's too nice.

15
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
Hello.

16
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,340
Could I have you a booking reference, please?

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,340
Hi.

18
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
How are you?

19
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
I'm all right.

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,340
How are you?

21
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
Cheers.

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
That's it?

23
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,340
Yay, really good.

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
Oh man, thank you so much.

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, that was it.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
So fast.

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Oh wow.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,760
The exit takes you right into the museum.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,980
This is quite a trip.

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:20,340
I haven't been anywhere inside like this for a year.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
Wow.

32
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,880
All right, no need to push it though.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,360
Time to go home.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,120
Thank you for having me.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,600
If you want a shot, the Science Museum's got slots.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
It's amazing to finally have this done.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Thank you to the literally thousands of scientists and medical personnel and logistics personnel,

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,740
all of whom worked together to make today happen and to make this possible.

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,840
Life already feels so different.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,680
It's time to get back to the world.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
I'll see you soon, internet.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,340
Bye.
