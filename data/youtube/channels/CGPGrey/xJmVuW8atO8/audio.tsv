0	6860	Good morning internet. Today is a day I thought would take many years to arrive and never have I been happier to be wrong.
7180	12360	Today is my COVID vaccination day and I'm heading over to my appointment
12400	17120	which just so happens to be at the coolest place to get a vaccination ever.
18640	26040	Beautiful! What a beautiful London day to start the potential of a summer with travel.
30140	34140	All good.
34140	63020	Okay, now just to find a spot to park.
63020	72740	It's surreal that this is finally going to happen, but if there's one place that's going
72740	77620	to be filled with unvaccinated people, it's a huge vaccine center.
77620	81900	So, time to gear up before going in.
81900	88380	Suited up and super pumped to get my vaccine at the coolest place in the city to do so.
88380	90020	The Science Museum.
90020	101660	All right, here we go.
101660	105140	It seems like you have potential for a lot more capacity than there is today.
105140	106140	That's too nice.
106140	107140	Hello.
107140	111340	Could I have you a booking reference, please?
111340	112340	Hi.
112340	113340	How are you?
113340	114340	I'm all right.
114340	115340	How are you?
115340	116340	Cheers.
116340	117340	That's it?
117340	118340	Yay, really good.
118340	119340	Oh man, thank you so much.
120340	122080	Oh, that was it.
122080	123080	So fast.
123080	124080	Oh wow.
124080	130760	The exit takes you right into the museum.
130760	131980	This is quite a trip.
131980	140340	I haven't been anywhere inside like this for a year.
140340	142340	Wow.
142340	147880	All right, no need to push it though.
147920	150360	Time to go home.
150360	152120	Thank you for having me.
152120	154600	If you want a shot, the Science Museum's got slots.
154600	157800	It's amazing to finally have this done.
157800	165200	Thank you to the literally thousands of scientists and medical personnel and logistics personnel,
165200	173740	all of whom worked together to make today happen and to make this possible.
173740	176840	Life already feels so different.
176840	179680	It's time to get back to the world.
179680	180800	I'll see you soon, internet.
206840	207340	Bye.
