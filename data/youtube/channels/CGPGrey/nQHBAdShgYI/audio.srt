00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
In Star Trek, the transporter moves you from one spot to another, saving on shuttle fuel and special effects budgets.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,100
In-universe, it's the safest way to travel.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,500
Yes, sometimes two guys die horrible mutilated deaths under rare circumstances,

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
but trillions of individuals transport to work every morning without a hiccup.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
But what if the transporter isn't as safe as claimed?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,300
What if the death rate isn't point almost nothing percent, but one hundred percent,

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,000
because the transporter is a suicide box?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,200
First, how does the transporter work?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,100
There are technical manuals with pages and pages of hilariously over-specific details that yet say so little.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,000
Star Trek is nothing if not consistently inconsistent, but taking the most common elements,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,600
first, the transporter scans you down to the quark, takes apart your atoms,

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,200
and sends the pieces of you to the destination for reassembly.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
But is it you on the other end, or a copy that thinks it's you?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,700
Well, who is you?

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,400
That's a hell of a big question, but let's try to be good scientists about it.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,800
We don't assume there's a magic part of you that can't be measured.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,300
After all, if it can't be measured, that means by definition it can't affect anything.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,600
So Occam's razor it away, and we take you as you seem to be,

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,200
a collection of atoms arranged to think they're you.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,700
And because the arrangement of atoms in post-transport you is exactly the same as pre-transport,

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,000
you must be you.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Case closed.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,900
But you might still have this nagging feeling that your experience of stepping into the transporter

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,300
will be a funny sound, a bright light, then nothingness eternal.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,900
While down on the planet a brand new life, complete with all your memories,

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,800
up to the moment before your death, popped into existence and assumed it's you.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,200
How could it otherwise?

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
It lives a life as short as the mission,

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,900
and a new creature with the memories of you both makes it back to the ship.

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,200
If true, multiply this by all the life forms in all the ships in all the star systems,

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,500
and this transport technology is a silent holocaust,

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,200
which makes an average episode of Trek rather grim-watching.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,900
And it's a small mercy when a crew member takes the turbolift rather than site-to-site transport.

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,900
But again, the measurements check out, so perhaps we're being paranoid,

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,500
and we're already late for our holiday on Risa, so just step inside already.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,400
But, atom reassembly is the optimistic version, and can't be how the transporter really works,

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,200
because sometimes accidents combine two crew into one, or split one into two.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
There aren't enough atoms in you to make a second you,

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,400
so the transporter has to be turning atoms into energy, and energy into atoms.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,600
You are destroyed, used to charge a battery, then recreated anew.

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,900
This really seems like death,

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,200
but the philosophy majors in the room are dying to bring up the ship of Theseus now, so fine.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
You take this ship on an adventure.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,900
As parts get worn, you replace each until, eventually, no piece is original.

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,400
When you return, is the ship of Theseus still the same ship of Theseus you left on?

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Seems so.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,200
And this is what your body does daily via eating, bringing in new atoms, and excreting.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,000
Losing atoms.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Compare to the Cutty Sark, a colonial T-ship burned down and restored with new parts.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,800
Is it still the same Cutty Sark?

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
The result is the same, all new parts, only the time it took is different.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
If you're happy ship of Theseus-ing through life, as you already do,

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,600
then getting Cutty Sark'd by transport shouldn't matter, right?

54
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,100
However, step into a working transporter with a broken disassembler, and death is revealed.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,900
Pre-transport and post-transport you can disagree on who is you,

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,200
and when Scotty tells pre-transport you,

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
sorry, the disassembler's broken, give us a minute to fix it,

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
you aren't going to wait around.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,500
That a copy of you made it to the destination is no consolation.

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
The transporter has to be a suicide box.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Okay, so why worry about the metaphysical implications of fictional technology?

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,900
Because the transporter points us to the problem of consciousness.

63
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,600
We were quick to cut out the idea of the unmeasurable before,

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
because everything we can measure about the copy is identical,

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
but there is something unmeasurably different.

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
The transporter forces confrontation with the possibility that there's something about

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
being a conscious creature that isn't measurable from the outside.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,900
Did we not contain conscious brains ourselves?

69
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,300
How would we know that other brains are conscious?

70
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,900
Truth be told, you can really only know that you are conscious,

71
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,600
and it seems polite to give other people the benefit of the doubt.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,900
But were a computer to claim that it was conscious, how would you know?

73
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,400
Your continuous stream of consciousness is your life,

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
and you are the only one who can experience it,

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,900
who can know if it exists and if it is continuous.

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,000
And transporters are scary because they cause breaks in that consciousness,

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,400
making a copy that lives the life that you have left with no one the wiser,

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,300
with no one able to be wiser.

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,500
And while transporters aren't real, breaks in consciousness are.

80
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,200
If you go for surgery when they put you under, you can't be sure if it's you that woke up.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,100
For that matter, your bed might be a suicide machine.

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,600
Every night's slip into unconsciousness, the warm embrace of the reaper.

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,800
And every morning, the first and only day of a new creature's conscious life.

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,700
It's impossible to know.

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Sleep well tonight.

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,500
