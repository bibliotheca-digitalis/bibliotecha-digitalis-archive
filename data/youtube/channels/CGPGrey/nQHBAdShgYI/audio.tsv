0	6500	In Star Trek, the transporter moves you from one spot to another, saving on shuttle fuel and special effects budgets.
6500	9100	In-universe, it's the safest way to travel.
9100	13500	Yes, sometimes two guys die horrible mutilated deaths under rare circumstances,
13500	17500	but trillions of individuals transport to work every morning without a hiccup.
17500	20000	But what if the transporter isn't as safe as claimed?
20000	24300	What if the death rate isn't point almost nothing percent, but one hundred percent,
24300	27000	because the transporter is a suicide box?
27000	29200	First, how does the transporter work?
29200	36100	There are technical manuals with pages and pages of hilariously over-specific details that yet say so little.
36100	41000	Star Trek is nothing if not consistently inconsistent, but taking the most common elements,
41000	44600	first, the transporter scans you down to the quark, takes apart your atoms,
44600	48200	and sends the pieces of you to the destination for reassembly.
48200	52000	But is it you on the other end, or a copy that thinks it's you?
52000	53700	Well, who is you?
53700	57400	That's a hell of a big question, but let's try to be good scientists about it.
57400	60800	We don't assume there's a magic part of you that can't be measured.
60800	65300	After all, if it can't be measured, that means by definition it can't affect anything.
65300	68600	So Occam's razor it away, and we take you as you seem to be,
68600	71200	a collection of atoms arranged to think they're you.
71200	75700	And because the arrangement of atoms in post-transport you is exactly the same as pre-transport,
75700	77000	you must be you.
77000	77800	Case closed.
77800	82900	But you might still have this nagging feeling that your experience of stepping into the transporter
82900	86300	will be a funny sound, a bright light, then nothingness eternal.
86300	89900	While down on the planet a brand new life, complete with all your memories,
89900	93800	up to the moment before your death, popped into existence and assumed it's you.
93800	95200	How could it otherwise?
95200	97200	It lives a life as short as the mission,
97200	100900	and a new creature with the memories of you both makes it back to the ship.
100900	105200	If true, multiply this by all the life forms in all the ships in all the star systems,
105200	108500	and this transport technology is a silent holocaust,
108500	112200	which makes an average episode of Trek rather grim-watching.
112200	116900	And it's a small mercy when a crew member takes the turbolift rather than site-to-site transport.
116900	119900	But again, the measurements check out, so perhaps we're being paranoid,
119900	123500	and we're already late for our holiday on Risa, so just step inside already.
123500	129400	But, atom reassembly is the optimistic version, and can't be how the transporter really works,
129400	134200	because sometimes accidents combine two crew into one, or split one into two.
134200	137200	There aren't enough atoms in you to make a second you,
137200	141400	so the transporter has to be turning atoms into energy, and energy into atoms.
141400	145600	You are destroyed, used to charge a battery, then recreated anew.
145600	147900	This really seems like death,
147900	153200	but the philosophy majors in the room are dying to bring up the ship of Theseus now, so fine.
153200	155000	You take this ship on an adventure.
155000	159900	As parts get worn, you replace each until, eventually, no piece is original.
159900	164400	When you return, is the ship of Theseus still the same ship of Theseus you left on?
164400	165200	Seems so.
165200	171200	And this is what your body does daily via eating, bringing in new atoms, and excreting.
171200	172000	Losing atoms.
172000	177600	Compare to the Cutty Sark, a colonial T-ship burned down and restored with new parts.
177600	179800	Is it still the same Cutty Sark?
179800	184800	The result is the same, all new parts, only the time it took is different.
184800	188800	If you're happy ship of Theseus-ing through life, as you already do,
188800	192600	then getting Cutty Sark'd by transport shouldn't matter, right?
192600	198100	However, step into a working transporter with a broken disassembler, and death is revealed.
198100	202900	Pre-transport and post-transport you can disagree on who is you,
202900	205200	and when Scotty tells pre-transport you,
205200	208200	sorry, the disassembler's broken, give us a minute to fix it,
208200	210200	you aren't going to wait around.
210200	214500	That a copy of you made it to the destination is no consolation.
214500	218000	The transporter has to be a suicide box.
218000	222200	Okay, so why worry about the metaphysical implications of fictional technology?
222200	225900	Because the transporter points us to the problem of consciousness.
225900	228600	We were quick to cut out the idea of the unmeasurable before,
228600	232600	because everything we can measure about the copy is identical,
232600	235600	but there is something unmeasurably different.
235600	240600	The transporter forces confrontation with the possibility that there's something about
240600	244600	being a conscious creature that isn't measurable from the outside.
244600	246900	Did we not contain conscious brains ourselves?
246900	249300	How would we know that other brains are conscious?
249300	252900	Truth be told, you can really only know that you are conscious,
252900	256600	and it seems polite to give other people the benefit of the doubt.
256600	260900	But were a computer to claim that it was conscious, how would you know?
260900	264400	Your continuous stream of consciousness is your life,
264400	267200	and you are the only one who can experience it,
267200	270900	who can know if it exists and if it is continuous.
270900	275000	And transporters are scary because they cause breaks in that consciousness,
275000	279400	making a copy that lives the life that you have left with no one the wiser,
279400	281300	with no one able to be wiser.
281300	285500	And while transporters aren't real, breaks in consciousness are.
285500	291200	If you go for surgery when they put you under, you can't be sure if it's you that woke up.
291200	294100	For that matter, your bed might be a suicide machine.
294100	299600	Every night's slip into unconsciousness, the warm embrace of the reaper.
299600	305800	And every morning, the first and only day of a new creature's conscious life.
305800	307700	It's impossible to know.
307700	308700	Sleep well tonight.
