00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
In Star Trek, the transporter moves you from one spot to another, saving on shuttle fuel and special effects budgets.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.100
In-universe, it's the safest way to travel.

00:09.100 --> 00:13.500
Yes, sometimes two guys die horrible mutilated deaths under rare circumstances,

00:13.500 --> 00:17.500
but trillions of individuals transport to work every morning without a hiccup.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.000
But what if the transporter isn't as safe as claimed?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.300
What if the death rate isn't point almost nothing percent, but one hundred percent,

00:24.300 --> 00:27.000
because the transporter is a suicide box?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.200
First, how does the transporter work?

00:29.200 --> 00:36.100
There are technical manuals with pages and pages of hilariously over-specific details that yet say so little.

00:36.100 --> 00:41.000
Star Trek is nothing if not consistently inconsistent, but taking the most common elements,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.600
first, the transporter scans you down to the quark, takes apart your atoms,

00:44.600 --> 00:48.200
and sends the pieces of you to the destination for reassembly.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.000
But is it you on the other end, or a copy that thinks it's you?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.700
Well, who is you?

00:53.700 --> 00:57.400
That's a hell of a big question, but let's try to be good scientists about it.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.800
We don't assume there's a magic part of you that can't be measured.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.300
After all, if it can't be measured, that means by definition it can't affect anything.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.600
So Occam's razor it away, and we take you as you seem to be,

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
a collection of atoms arranged to think they're you.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.700
And because the arrangement of atoms in post-transport you is exactly the same as pre-transport,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.000
you must be you.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.800
Case closed.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.900
But you might still have this nagging feeling that your experience of stepping into the transporter

01:22.900 --> 01:26.300
will be a funny sound, a bright light, then nothingness eternal.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.900
While down on the planet a brand new life, complete with all your memories,

01:29.900 --> 01:33.800
up to the moment before your death, popped into existence and assumed it's you.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.200
How could it otherwise?

01:35.200 --> 01:37.200
It lives a life as short as the mission,

01:37.200 --> 01:40.900
and a new creature with the memories of you both makes it back to the ship.

01:40.900 --> 01:45.200
If true, multiply this by all the life forms in all the ships in all the star systems,

01:45.200 --> 01:48.500
and this transport technology is a silent holocaust,

01:48.500 --> 01:52.200
which makes an average episode of Trek rather grim-watching.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.900
And it's a small mercy when a crew member takes the turbolift rather than site-to-site transport.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.900
But again, the measurements check out, so perhaps we're being paranoid,

01:59.900 --> 02:03.500
and we're already late for our holiday on Risa, so just step inside already.

02:03.500 --> 02:09.400
But, atom reassembly is the optimistic version, and can't be how the transporter really works,

02:09.400 --> 02:14.200
because sometimes accidents combine two crew into one, or split one into two.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.200
There aren't enough atoms in you to make a second you,

02:17.200 --> 02:21.400
so the transporter has to be turning atoms into energy, and energy into atoms.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.600
You are destroyed, used to charge a battery, then recreated anew.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.900
This really seems like death,

02:27.900 --> 02:33.200
but the philosophy majors in the room are dying to bring up the ship of Theseus now, so fine.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.000
You take this ship on an adventure.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.900
As parts get worn, you replace each until, eventually, no piece is original.

02:39.900 --> 02:44.400
When you return, is the ship of Theseus still the same ship of Theseus you left on?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.200
Seems so.

02:45.200 --> 02:51.200
And this is what your body does daily via eating, bringing in new atoms, and excreting.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.000
Losing atoms.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.600
Compare to the Cutty Sark, a colonial T-ship burned down and restored with new parts.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.800
Is it still the same Cutty Sark?

02:59.800 --> 03:04.800
The result is the same, all new parts, only the time it took is different.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.800
If you're happy ship of Theseus-ing through life, as you already do,

03:08.800 --> 03:12.600
then getting Cutty Sark'd by transport shouldn't matter, right?

03:12.600 --> 03:18.100
However, step into a working transporter with a broken disassembler, and death is revealed.

03:18.100 --> 03:22.900
Pre-transport and post-transport you can disagree on who is you,

03:22.900 --> 03:25.200
and when Scotty tells pre-transport you,

03:25.200 --> 03:28.200
sorry, the disassembler's broken, give us a minute to fix it,

03:28.200 --> 03:30.200
you aren't going to wait around.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.500
That a copy of you made it to the destination is no consolation.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.000
The transporter has to be a suicide box.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.200
Okay, so why worry about the metaphysical implications of fictional technology?

03:42.200 --> 03:45.900
Because the transporter points us to the problem of consciousness.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.600
We were quick to cut out the idea of the unmeasurable before,

03:48.600 --> 03:52.600
because everything we can measure about the copy is identical,

03:52.600 --> 03:55.600
but there is something unmeasurably different.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.600
The transporter forces confrontation with the possibility that there's something about

04:00.600 --> 04:04.600
being a conscious creature that isn't measurable from the outside.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.900
Did we not contain conscious brains ourselves?

04:06.900 --> 04:09.300
How would we know that other brains are conscious?

04:09.300 --> 04:12.900
Truth be told, you can really only know that you are conscious,

04:12.900 --> 04:16.600
and it seems polite to give other people the benefit of the doubt.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.900
But were a computer to claim that it was conscious, how would you know?

04:20.900 --> 04:24.400
Your continuous stream of consciousness is your life,

04:24.400 --> 04:27.200
and you are the only one who can experience it,

04:27.200 --> 04:30.900
who can know if it exists and if it is continuous.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.000
And transporters are scary because they cause breaks in that consciousness,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.400
making a copy that lives the life that you have left with no one the wiser,

04:39.400 --> 04:41.300
with no one able to be wiser.

04:41.300 --> 04:45.500
And while transporters aren't real, breaks in consciousness are.

04:45.500 --> 04:51.200
If you go for surgery when they put you under, you can't be sure if it's you that woke up.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.100
For that matter, your bed might be a suicide machine.

04:54.100 --> 04:59.600
Every night's slip into unconsciousness, the warm embrace of the reaper.

04:59.600 --> 05:05.800
And every morning, the first and only day of a new creature's conscious life.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.700
It's impossible to know.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.700
Sleep well tonight.
