00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello, Internet. Let's talk about this map, this argument, and the Electoral College in general.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,800
In my Trouble with the Electoral College video from 2011,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,800
I was wrong to use the city limits for that part of the argument, rather than the more expansive metro area.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,700
The lawyer-ish nerd inside of me still wants to argue technically correct on that one.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,600
I use the city boundaries because the metro areas are often vague and absurdly large.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
The New York metro area is 6,700 plus square miles over four states.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,600
And from where I partly grew up, it seemed that a lot of that area had nothing to do with New York City proper.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,800
So at the time, I disregarded the metro boundaries.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,300
But using the strict city boundaries in that video was the wrong decision in retrospect.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,600
In addition to being a bad argument to make, it also doesn't address the concerns this map express.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,900
And this is correct. Half the population does live in the gray counties.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,400
And more than that, the map gets at a fundamental division in the United States and other countries

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,000
that leads partly to the politics we see, the difference between the rural and the urban.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,600
If trends continue, a higher and higher percentage of the country will live in urban areas.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,400
In another 8 or 16 years, this map will be even more extreme, the metro areas even denser.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,000
Which, if you're in favor of the Electoral College, will seem like even more of a reason to keep it.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,600
Now this is where we must discuss the idea that the Electoral College ensures the president is elected by the states.

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,900
It doesn't. A candidate can win the Electoral College with just the 11 biggest states.

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,200
This collection may seem unlikely, but as urbanization and the politics it creates continues, it becomes increasingly likely.

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,200
The Electoral College doesn't ensure the president wins with a lot of states or even geographically diverse states.

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, should the president represent the people or should the president represent the states is a question without an answer.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,400
This is about preference in style of governance.

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,400
One moves power up to the federal level and the other moves power down to the states.

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,900
And given the vastness of the country and the difference in her geographies,

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,500
it's reasonable to believe that states with greater power is the better, less divisive solution to the problem of governance.

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,000
But the Electoral College does nothing to help that.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,700
It happens to be that recent wins have been geographically spread, but the Electoral College doesn't ensure that outcome.

28
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,800
Cram everyone into California, leaving one person in each state, and the Electoral College says California alone, she decides.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:47,500
We could have a system where the president must win a majority of the states, which is what some think the Electoral College is, but it isn't.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,100
The election only happens to make it look that way.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,100
The protection of the Electoral College is only an illusion.

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,900
Even if you still like the Electoral College, though it doesn't actually protect the small states,

33
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,500
the Electoral College still comes with the most bitter of anti-republic pills.

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,700
For even if you win the election in November, your victory can be taken away from you in December.

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,800
The Electoral College votes your state gets aren't really votes,

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,600
but are individual members of the political parties who perform the real vote for president in December.

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:33,600
No citizen voted for these electors to cast a vote on their behalf, and many of the electors are free to vote for whoever they want.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Their election in December is the real election.

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,900
The Electoral College was designed to be able to overwrite the will of the people, or its own election process,

40
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:54,400
any time enough of a small number of unknown, unelected political party insiders don't like the result they got.

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
If you're in favor of the Electoral College, you have to accept that by its own rules,

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,000
it can take away your victory under the guise of protecting you from yourself.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,800
This has never happened in American history, nor should it,

44
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,100
but it is crazy to leave in place for future elections a system that benefits no citizens and protects no states.

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:29,600
It's time to get rid of the Electoral College and have a real discussion about what a modern government and election system should look like.

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,300
