0	5700	Hello, Internet. Let's talk about this map, this argument, and the Electoral College in general.
5700	9800	In my Trouble with the Electoral College video from 2011,
9800	16800	I was wrong to use the city limits for that part of the argument, rather than the more expansive metro area.
16800	20700	The lawyer-ish nerd inside of me still wants to argue technically correct on that one.
20700	25600	I use the city boundaries because the metro areas are often vague and absurdly large.
25600	30800	The New York metro area is 6,700 plus square miles over four states.
30800	37600	And from where I partly grew up, it seemed that a lot of that area had nothing to do with New York City proper.
37600	40800	So at the time, I disregarded the metro boundaries.
40800	46300	But using the strict city boundaries in that video was the wrong decision in retrospect.
46300	53600	In addition to being a bad argument to make, it also doesn't address the concerns this map express.
53600	57900	And this is correct. Half the population does live in the gray counties.
57900	63400	And more than that, the map gets at a fundamental division in the United States and other countries
63400	69000	that leads partly to the politics we see, the difference between the rural and the urban.
69000	74600	If trends continue, a higher and higher percentage of the country will live in urban areas.
74600	81400	In another 8 or 16 years, this map will be even more extreme, the metro areas even denser.
81500	87000	Which, if you're in favor of the Electoral College, will seem like even more of a reason to keep it.
87000	93600	Now this is where we must discuss the idea that the Electoral College ensures the president is elected by the states.
93600	98900	It doesn't. A candidate can win the Electoral College with just the 11 biggest states.
98900	106200	This collection may seem unlikely, but as urbanization and the politics it creates continues, it becomes increasingly likely.
106200	112200	The Electoral College doesn't ensure the president wins with a lot of states or even geographically diverse states.
112200	120000	Now, should the president represent the people or should the president represent the states is a question without an answer.
120000	123400	This is about preference in style of governance.
123400	128400	One moves power up to the federal level and the other moves power down to the states.
128400	131900	And given the vastness of the country and the difference in her geographies,
131900	139500	it's reasonable to believe that states with greater power is the better, less divisive solution to the problem of governance.
139500	143000	But the Electoral College does nothing to help that.
143000	150700	It happens to be that recent wins have been geographically spread, but the Electoral College doesn't ensure that outcome.
150700	158800	Cram everyone into California, leaving one person in each state, and the Electoral College says California alone, she decides.
158800	167500	We could have a system where the president must win a majority of the states, which is what some think the Electoral College is, but it isn't.
167500	171100	The election only happens to make it look that way.
171100	175100	The protection of the Electoral College is only an illusion.
175100	179900	Even if you still like the Electoral College, though it doesn't actually protect the small states,
179900	185500	the Electoral College still comes with the most bitter of anti-republic pills.
185500	192700	For even if you win the election in November, your victory can be taken away from you in December.
192700	196800	The Electoral College votes your state gets aren't really votes,
196800	204600	but are individual members of the political parties who perform the real vote for president in December.
204600	213600	No citizen voted for these electors to cast a vote on their behalf, and many of the electors are free to vote for whoever they want.
213600	217600	Their election in December is the real election.
217600	224900	The Electoral College was designed to be able to overwrite the will of the people, or its own election process,
224900	234400	any time enough of a small number of unknown, unelected political party insiders don't like the result they got.
234400	240400	If you're in favor of the Electoral College, you have to accept that by its own rules,
240400	247000	it can take away your victory under the guise of protecting you from yourself.
247000	250800	This has never happened in American history, nor should it,
250800	260100	but it is crazy to leave in place for future elections a system that benefits no citizens and protects no states.
260100	269600	It's time to get rid of the Electoral College and have a real discussion about what a modern government and election system should look like.
