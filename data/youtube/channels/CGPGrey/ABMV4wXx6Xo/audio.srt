1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,080
It's a waste.

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:39,200
Oh!

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Well, I guess I need one of these.

4
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

5
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

6
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

7
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Jesus f***ing Christ, this is creepy.

8
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:50,200
Too many things moving around in the dark.

9
00:03:50,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Oh, is this how I would turn the power on?

10
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
That fuse does not want to be flipped.

11
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

12
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:28,200
God damn these tumbleweeds.

13
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I really wish these lights worked.

14
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,200
God, it's freezing in here.

15
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh wow.

16
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Maybe the computer will turn on.

17
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:20,200
No.

18
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Oh, I am not going through that door.

19
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Let's get out of here.

20
00:06:34,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Oh my God.

21
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I think up is locked, or is down locked?

22
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh.

23
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
This is a very nervous feeling that the car is going to disappear.

24
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,200
But I still see her.

25
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Just barely on the horizon.

26
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh, this one looks open.

27
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Christ.

28
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
No thank you.

29
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:56,200
No thank you horrible spiky plant.

30
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh.

31
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Oh yeah, hear that?

32
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
They don't make switches like they used to.

33
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Yeah.

34
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:29,200
When I flip a switch, I want to know it.

35
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Okay, so down is locked, or down is unlocked.

36
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh, ****.

37
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Is that moving?

38
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:01,200
No, it's not moving.

39
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Oh man, so close.

40
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I can't move this one for anything.

41
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Okay, maybe there's another way in.

42
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh.

43
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Hello.

44
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
There's a way in.

45
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm not going to take it though.

46
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm going to pass on this little discovery.

47
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay.

48
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Okay.

49
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Little bit of bone.

50
00:10:50,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Sure looks like bone.

51
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
The tumbleweed are like Tribble.

52
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Like a slow motion swarm of Tribble trying to knock down the fence.

53
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:54,200
The sun's getting low, but I missed a spot back here.

54
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I think she's not very happy about me being here.

55
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Oh, I've got to go in there.

56
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
That's what you want me to think.

57
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah, well.

58
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh god.

59
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I can't see anything down that corridor.

60
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
All right, strategic pride.

61
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Let's go down there.

62
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Okay, we're going to stop here.

63
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm more than a little terrified of these doors locking behind me.

64
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:53,200
It's not like you can make an emergency cell phone call from an underground bunker.

65
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:05,200
If I've learned anything about the way these places work, this staircase should take me to a hole where that top part was.

66
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, if it was under there, it's got to go up into this building.

67
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,200
It's another one of these buildings on tracks.

68
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Ooh, there's a storm coming in.

69
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I really should start to skedaddle.

70
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Because this one's locked, I want to get in the most. Oh, sweet.

71
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:10,200
There's also these little windows to look in.

72
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Are these windows supposed to line up with?

73
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Oh, yes.

74
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,200
So these three holes must match the three holes on the outside.

75
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,200
All right, these three holes on the outside.

76
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
So what does that mean, though?

77
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:57,200
So if I stand here, I'm going to turn right around.

78
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm looking at that building.

79
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I guess that thing must move off to the side.

80
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I have to figure out how this actually works.

81
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Okay, we're really almost out of daylight.

82
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Time to go.

83
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Ooh, didn't quite make it out before the storm.

84
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:41,200
A little much tumbleweed. Take it down a notch.

85
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:24,200
There we go.

86
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:56,200
There we go.
