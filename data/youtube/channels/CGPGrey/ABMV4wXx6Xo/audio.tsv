0	22080	It's a waste.
22080	39200	Oh!
99200	106200	Well, I guess I need one of these.
129200	153200	Let's see if I can get one of these.
153200	177200	Let's see if I can get one of these.
177200	201200	Let's see if I can get one of these.
201200	213600	Jesus f***ing Christ, this is creepy.
213600	230200	Too many things moving around in the dark.
230200	240200	Oh, is this how I would turn the power on?
240200	244200	That fuse does not want to be flipped.
270200	299200	Let's see if I can get one of these.
299200	328200	God damn these tumbleweeds.
328200	334200	I really wish these lights worked.
334200	341200	God, it's freezing in here.
341200	356200	Oh wow.
356200	361200	Maybe the computer will turn on.
361200	380200	No.
380200	389200	Oh, I am not going through that door.
389200	394200	Let's get out of here.
394200	422200	Oh my God.
422200	441200	I think up is locked, or is down locked?
441200	444200	Oh.
444200	447200	This is a very nervous feeling that the car is going to disappear.
447200	451200	But I still see her.
451200	455200	Just barely on the horizon.
455200	458200	Oh, this one looks open.
458200	460200	Christ.
460200	462200	No thank you.
462200	476200	No thank you horrible spiky plant.
476200	493200	Oh.
493200	495200	Oh yeah, hear that?
495200	498200	They don't make switches like they used to.
498200	499200	Yeah.
499200	509200	When I flip a switch, I want to know it.
509200	522200	Okay, so down is locked, or down is unlocked.
522200	528200	Oh, ****.
528200	532200	Is that moving?
532200	541200	No, it's not moving.
541200	544200	Oh man, so close.
544200	550200	I can't move this one for anything.
550200	562200	Okay, maybe there's another way in.
562200	564200	Oh.
564200	567200	Hello.
567200	569200	There's a way in.
569200	572200	I'm not going to take it though.
572200	581200	I'm going to pass on this little discovery.
602200	622200	Okay.
622200	644200	Okay.
644200	650200	Little bit of bone.
650200	678200	Sure looks like bone.
678200	680200	The tumbleweed are like Tribble.
680200	687200	Like a slow motion swarm of Tribble trying to knock down the fence.
687200	714200	The sun's getting low, but I missed a spot back here.
714200	719200	I think she's not very happy about me being here.
719200	739200	Oh, I've got to go in there.
739200	743200	That's what you want me to think.
743200	766200	Yeah, well.
766200	768200	Oh god.
768200	775200	I can't see anything down that corridor.
776200	778200	All right, strategic pride.
778200	780200	Let's go down there.
809200	822200	Okay, we're going to stop here.
822200	826200	I'm more than a little terrified of these doors locking behind me.
826200	833200	It's not like you can make an emergency cell phone call from an underground bunker.
833200	845200	If I've learned anything about the way these places work, this staircase should take me to a hole where that top part was.
845200	858200	Yeah, if it was under there, it's got to go up into this building.
858200	865200	It's another one of these buildings on tracks.
865200	868200	Ooh, there's a storm coming in.
868200	872200	I really should start to skedaddle.
872200	897200	Because this one's locked, I want to get in the most. Oh, sweet.
897200	910200	There's also these little windows to look in.
910200	926200	Are these windows supposed to line up with?
926200	936200	Oh, yes.
936200	940200	So these three holes must match the three holes on the outside.
940200	945200	All right, these three holes on the outside.
945200	948200	So what does that mean, though?
948200	957200	So if I stand here, I'm going to turn right around.
957200	960200	I'm looking at that building.
960200	963200	I guess that thing must move off to the side.
963200	966200	I have to figure out how this actually works.
966200	970200	Okay, we're really almost out of daylight.
970200	980200	Time to go.
980200	992200	Ooh, didn't quite make it out before the storm.
992200	1001200	A little much tumbleweed. Take it down a notch.
1022200	1044200	There we go.
1052200	1076200	There we go.
