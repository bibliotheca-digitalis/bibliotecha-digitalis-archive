00:00.000 --> 00:22.080
It's a waste.

00:22.080 --> 00:39.200
Oh!

01:39.200 --> 01:46.200
Well, I guess I need one of these.

02:09.200 --> 02:33.200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

02:33.200 --> 02:57.200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

02:57.200 --> 03:21.200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

03:21.200 --> 03:33.600
Jesus f***ing Christ, this is creepy.

03:33.600 --> 03:50.200
Too many things moving around in the dark.

03:50.200 --> 04:00.200
Oh, is this how I would turn the power on?

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
That fuse does not want to be flipped.

04:30.200 --> 04:59.200
Let's see if I can get one of these.

04:59.200 --> 05:28.200
God damn these tumbleweeds.

05:28.200 --> 05:34.200
I really wish these lights worked.

05:34.200 --> 05:41.200
God, it's freezing in here.

05:41.200 --> 05:56.200
Oh wow.

05:56.200 --> 06:01.200
Maybe the computer will turn on.

06:01.200 --> 06:20.200
No.

06:20.200 --> 06:29.200
Oh, I am not going through that door.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.200
Let's get out of here.

06:34.200 --> 07:02.200
Oh my God.

07:02.200 --> 07:21.200
I think up is locked, or is down locked?

07:21.200 --> 07:24.200
Oh.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.200
This is a very nervous feeling that the car is going to disappear.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.200
But I still see her.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.200
Just barely on the horizon.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.200
Oh, this one looks open.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.200
Christ.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
No thank you.

07:42.200 --> 07:56.200
No thank you horrible spiky plant.

07:56.200 --> 08:13.200
Oh.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
Oh yeah, hear that?

08:15.200 --> 08:18.200
They don't make switches like they used to.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.200
Yeah.

08:19.200 --> 08:29.200
When I flip a switch, I want to know it.

08:29.200 --> 08:42.200
Okay, so down is locked, or down is unlocked.

08:42.200 --> 08:48.200
Oh, ****.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.200
Is that moving?

08:52.200 --> 09:01.200
No, it's not moving.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.200
Oh man, so close.

09:04.200 --> 09:10.200
I can't move this one for anything.

09:10.200 --> 09:22.200
Okay, maybe there's another way in.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
Oh.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.200
Hello.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
There's a way in.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.200
I'm not going to take it though.

09:32.200 --> 09:41.200
I'm going to pass on this little discovery.

10:02.200 --> 10:22.200
Okay.

10:22.200 --> 10:44.200
Okay.

10:44.200 --> 10:50.200
Little bit of bone.

10:50.200 --> 11:18.200
Sure looks like bone.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
The tumbleweed are like Tribble.

11:20.200 --> 11:27.200
Like a slow motion swarm of Tribble trying to knock down the fence.

11:27.200 --> 11:54.200
The sun's getting low, but I missed a spot back here.

11:54.200 --> 11:59.200
I think she's not very happy about me being here.

11:59.200 --> 12:19.200
Oh, I've got to go in there.

12:19.200 --> 12:23.200
That's what you want me to think.

12:23.200 --> 12:46.200
Yeah, well.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.200
Oh god.

12:48.200 --> 12:55.200
I can't see anything down that corridor.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
All right, strategic pride.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
Let's go down there.

13:29.200 --> 13:42.200
Okay, we're going to stop here.

13:42.200 --> 13:46.200
I'm more than a little terrified of these doors locking behind me.

13:46.200 --> 13:53.200
It's not like you can make an emergency cell phone call from an underground bunker.

13:53.200 --> 14:05.200
If I've learned anything about the way these places work, this staircase should take me to a hole where that top part was.

14:05.200 --> 14:18.200
Yeah, if it was under there, it's got to go up into this building.

14:18.200 --> 14:25.200
It's another one of these buildings on tracks.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.200
Ooh, there's a storm coming in.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.200
I really should start to skedaddle.

14:32.200 --> 14:57.200
Because this one's locked, I want to get in the most. Oh, sweet.

14:57.200 --> 15:10.200
There's also these little windows to look in.

15:10.200 --> 15:26.200
Are these windows supposed to line up with?

15:26.200 --> 15:36.200
Oh, yes.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.200
So these three holes must match the three holes on the outside.

15:40.200 --> 15:45.200
All right, these three holes on the outside.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
So what does that mean, though?

15:48.200 --> 15:57.200
So if I stand here, I'm going to turn right around.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.200
I'm looking at that building.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.200
I guess that thing must move off to the side.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.200
I have to figure out how this actually works.

16:06.200 --> 16:10.200
Okay, we're really almost out of daylight.

16:10.200 --> 16:20.200
Time to go.

16:20.200 --> 16:32.200
Ooh, didn't quite make it out before the storm.

16:32.200 --> 16:41.200
A little much tumbleweed. Take it down a notch.

17:02.200 --> 17:24.200
There we go.

17:32.200 --> 17:56.200
There we go.
