00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
The United States of America.

00:01.840 --> 00:04.960
You too, Hawaii and Alaska, to scale, for once.

00:04.960 --> 00:09.280
Ever since these states united to create America, the federal government of America,

00:09.280 --> 00:11.760
they and she fought mightily over the land,

00:11.760 --> 00:15.600
which plains or forests or mountains or swamps to end up in each hand.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.680
On the map, it looks like states hold all the cards, but they don't.

00:19.680 --> 00:24.960
Just under one third of land in the United States is federal, but that's an average.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.200
Looking at the percent of federal land in the states, the wester we go, the federal are the land,

00:29.200 --> 00:31.920
and the less of the state that's in each state.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.800
There's eastern states with under 1% federal land,

00:34.800 --> 00:40.080
and five western states that control less than half of the land in their borders.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.520
How? What?

00:41.520 --> 00:44.000
First thing first, how did this happen?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.400
America wasn't always the mighty united.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.320
Like us all, she started small, when states were young, new, and few,

00:50.320 --> 00:52.720
giving away but little for her to play.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.240
But then America grew.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.520
Louisiana purchasing, Mexican sessioning, and manifest-destining her way across the continent.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.800
But in this age of empires, it won't do any good to say she owns the land,

01:04.800 --> 01:11.120
unless she gets her citizens out there to occupy the vast, totally unoccupied continent.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.920
So America turns from hoarder to minimalist,

01:13.920 --> 01:18.800
disposing of as much of the land to new states and new settlers as she can.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.960
Sometimes giving it away in literal races, where plots of land were drawn,

01:22.960 --> 01:28.400
homesteaders waited at a starting line, and bang, first family to a plot owns that plot.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.200
Says who?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.320
Says America.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.920
She's booting up a private property ladder from virgin land, using contracts and guns.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.680
10% of all the land in the US was given away for free just to get people out west.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.000
See also railroad companies, which got the land either side of any track they could build

01:46.000 --> 01:47.760
for the length of a continent.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.720
If you could live on or improve the land in the 1800s, America would probably give it to you.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.640
But by the 1900s, most of the states are mostly in place,

01:56.640 --> 02:00.000
and the age of empires and wagons westward is over.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.400
But America still had a ton of land she didn't or couldn't give away.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.800
And now that the states are settled, well, what she has is all she will ever have.

02:10.800 --> 02:17.120
She turns away from her gifting minimalism and becomes a curator of her collection of land.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.120
This change was rather a shock to states expecting the land

02:21.120 --> 02:23.920
in their borders would be land in their borders.

02:23.920 --> 02:29.040
That federal land would continue to be turned over as it had for a century, but no.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.400
Thus this map and a lot of angry western states

02:32.400 --> 02:37.440
now up against a fully operational federal government altering the deal.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.960
Some states like poor Utah and Nevada found themselves with hardly any state in their state.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.200
Or, hey, hey, what about the reservations?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.400
Are you going to talk about them?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.440
Are they federal land?

02:47.440 --> 02:49.520
Some of us have a lot of reservations in our state.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.600
Ah, the reservations, yes.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.160
What a great story for another time.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.920
Look, we can't do the reservations right now.

02:59.920 --> 03:00.960
We just can't.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.080
Okay, history aside, America has all this land now.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.600
But like, what is it for?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.720
What is it for?

03:06.720 --> 03:07.360
A lot.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.160
Almost all of the following will have an in general before it,

03:10.160 --> 03:14.480
because there are almost 2,000 separate bureaucracies administering land

03:14.480 --> 03:19.440
that, were it a single country, would be in the top 10 list of biggest countries.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.520
But in general, most of the federal land falls under the control of the president,

03:23.520 --> 03:28.800
to whom a dozen secretaries report, of which we care about three, that run five departments.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.400
First, the Department of Defense.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.320
She runs military bases and nuclear silos and all the toys of war.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.920
America has to keep them somewhere, and if sororicide taught her anything,

03:37.920 --> 03:40.080
it's don't trust the states with weapons.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.800
So keep them close on federal land she does.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.000
While America's military is big, the Department of Defense holds the least land of the top five.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.920
Next is the National Park Service.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.040
The Grand Canyon and Yellowstone and Blue Ridge Mountains.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.440
If there's an epic vista you visited or heard of in America, it's probably one of hers.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.680
National Parks is the celebrity of the group and can really stand out.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.000
Next biggest is the Fish and Wildlife Service.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.240
Much less known, except if you're in Alaska, where 85% of her land is.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.360
Fish and Wildlife is in the business of animal conservation,

04:11.360 --> 04:15.920
keeping land for America's species under her aegis, not to be developed.

04:15.920 --> 04:21.200
Then there's the Forest Service, often confused with national parks, but not remotely the same.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.360
There's many a breathtaking national forest you can hike through, but they're not parks.

04:25.360 --> 04:30.960
They're more America's resource tiles, least for logging, plus grassland tiles for grazing.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.240
Forest Service's job is to balance extraction with maintenance.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.040
How well she does this is an endless source of argument between America and the states

04:39.040 --> 04:41.760
and the companies that want to use those resource tiles.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.600
It's a job that guarantees someone is always going to be angry.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.280
Only you can prevent forest fires?

04:47.280 --> 04:52.880
That's the Forest Service, because she deals with these kinds of fires as well as these kinds of fires.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.160
And it's a job she splits with the last and the biggest, the Bureau of Land Management.

04:58.160 --> 05:03.280
She does it all, from resolving cow disputes, to leasing land for mining, to building parks,

05:03.280 --> 05:08.240
to preserving the coastal waters of California, which surprise California, are federal land.

05:08.240 --> 05:14.480
BLM does a lot and is the biggest, which can make it very confusing about which agency does what.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.600
But think of it this way.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.640
There are three goals.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.640
Conservation, Recreation, Extraction.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.360
BLM does all three, FS does Conservation and Extraction,

05:21.360 --> 05:24.400
F&W does Conservation, NPS Conservation, Recreation.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.520
Again, in general.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.280
These four plus war control 97% of federal land.

05:29.280 --> 05:34.160
The last 3% is miscellaneous, used by departments like the Postal Service or NASA

05:34.160 --> 05:36.160
or the Department of Energy or others.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.240
Okay, this is lovely, but like, what does it mean to say that land is federal?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.160
Is it part of the state or not?

05:42.160 --> 05:47.680
Well, this brings up the delicate and sensitive balance of power between the states and America.

05:47.680 --> 05:52.400
And there's an enormous amount of words, words, words around the sovereignty of governments.

05:52.400 --> 05:57.920
But ultimately, federal land belongs to America, and she can do with it what she wants,

05:57.920 --> 05:59.760
and the states have to just suck it.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.960
Most starkly in Nevada, where federal land was used for nuclear bomb testing.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.840
Yeah, that's a pretty big hole you punched in Nevada, America.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.160
Oh, not just the once.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.760
When push comes to shove, America can shove.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.680
That's the most extreme example.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.080
But federal lands will often have their own separate federal law enforcement officers,

06:28.080 --> 06:32.320
like the Investigative Services Branch, a kind of FBI for national parks.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.600
Though state borders do matter here, for lesser crimes,

06:35.600 --> 06:39.840
federal officers will often dump suspects into the state courts to deal with.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.320
Private citizens can't buy property on federal land.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.200
There are Americans who will tell you they live in a national park.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.040
Cape Cod and Fire Island National Parks are examples of this.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.520
But if you zoom into official maps, you'll often find hilarious borders

06:53.520 --> 06:57.760
that swoop around and in between developed and undeveloped areas.

06:57.760 --> 07:02.720
There's also military bases, which will have soldiers living in them, but they can't own anything.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.640
And because it's federal land, the Department of Defense that builds the housing

07:06.640 --> 07:10.160
can ignore all a state's laws about housing or health codes.

07:10.160 --> 07:14.720
So a state can't control in a meaningful way federal land in her borders.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.880
Hundreds of acres of federal grassland might suddenly be filled with grazing cattle,

07:18.880 --> 07:22.160
or pow, be declared a national monument and preserved forever,

07:22.160 --> 07:24.640
or plumbed for oil and mined for minerals,

07:24.640 --> 07:27.760
with the state just standing on the sidelines, watching.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.080
Thus, states can't build their own towns or parks or factories in federal land

07:32.080 --> 07:35.280
to, you know, collect any taxes from the land.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.600
Which, once America made her intention to keep federal land forever,

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
made the states with a lot of it start to grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.480
Fine, I'll give you payment in lieu of taxes.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.680
Are you happy now?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.280
Is this a joke? Is this for real?

07:49.280 --> 07:50.800
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.760
All of this means today there's a big political divide

07:53.760 --> 07:57.680
between the states that have a lot of federal land and the states that don't.

07:57.680 --> 08:02.400
With eastern states thinking of federal land as belonging to the nation as a whole.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.600
Which is easy to do when you don't have a lot of it within your borders,

08:05.600 --> 08:09.840
and federal land to you means visiting Glacier National Park on vacation.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.520
Meanwhile, western states are getting nuclear bombs detonated in their backyards,

08:13.520 --> 08:19.040
and compensation they don't think is fair for land that affects them that they can't control.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.120
There's a million more complications this simplification can't possibly cover,

08:23.120 --> 08:27.360
but the best way to think about federal land is that while it may be in a state,

08:27.360 --> 08:29.360
it is not of the state.
