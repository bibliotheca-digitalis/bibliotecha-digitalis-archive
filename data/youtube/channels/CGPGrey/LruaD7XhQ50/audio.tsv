0	1840	The United States of America.
1840	4960	You too, Hawaii and Alaska, to scale, for once.
4960	9280	Ever since these states united to create America, the federal government of America,
9280	11760	they and she fought mightily over the land,
11760	15600	which plains or forests or mountains or swamps to end up in each hand.
15600	19680	On the map, it looks like states hold all the cards, but they don't.
19680	24960	Just under one third of land in the United States is federal, but that's an average.
24960	29200	Looking at the percent of federal land in the states, the wester we go, the federal are the land,
29200	31920	and the less of the state that's in each state.
31920	34800	There's eastern states with under 1% federal land,
34800	40080	and five western states that control less than half of the land in their borders.
40080	41520	How? What?
41520	44000	First thing first, how did this happen?
44000	46400	America wasn't always the mighty united.
46400	50320	Like us all, she started small, when states were young, new, and few,
50320	52720	giving away but little for her to play.
52720	54240	But then America grew.
54240	59520	Louisiana purchasing, Mexican sessioning, and manifest-destining her way across the continent.
59520	64800	But in this age of empires, it won't do any good to say she owns the land,
64800	71120	unless she gets her citizens out there to occupy the vast, totally unoccupied continent.
71120	73920	So America turns from hoarder to minimalist,
73920	78800	disposing of as much of the land to new states and new settlers as she can.
78800	82960	Sometimes giving it away in literal races, where plots of land were drawn,
82960	88400	homesteaders waited at a starting line, and bang, first family to a plot owns that plot.
88400	89200	Says who?
89200	90320	Says America.
90320	95920	She's booting up a private property ladder from virgin land, using contracts and guns.
95920	101680	10% of all the land in the US was given away for free just to get people out west.
101680	106000	See also railroad companies, which got the land either side of any track they could build
106000	107760	for the length of a continent.
107760	112720	If you could live on or improve the land in the 1800s, America would probably give it to you.
112800	116640	But by the 1900s, most of the states are mostly in place,
116640	120000	and the age of empires and wagons westward is over.
120000	124400	But America still had a ton of land she didn't or couldn't give away.
124400	130800	And now that the states are settled, well, what she has is all she will ever have.
130800	137120	She turns away from her gifting minimalism and becomes a curator of her collection of land.
137120	141120	This change was rather a shock to states expecting the land
141120	143920	in their borders would be land in their borders.
143920	149040	That federal land would continue to be turned over as it had for a century, but no.
149040	152400	Thus this map and a lot of angry western states
152400	157440	now up against a fully operational federal government altering the deal.
157440	162960	Some states like poor Utah and Nevada found themselves with hardly any state in their state.
162960	165200	Or, hey, hey, what about the reservations?
165200	166400	Are you going to talk about them?
166400	167440	Are they federal land?
167440	169520	Some of us have a lot of reservations in our state.
169520	173600	Ah, the reservations, yes.
174720	178160	What a great story for another time.
178160	179920	Look, we can't do the reservations right now.
179920	180960	We just can't.
180960	184080	Okay, history aside, America has all this land now.
184080	185600	But like, what is it for?
185600	186720	What is it for?
186720	187360	A lot.
187360	190160	Almost all of the following will have an in general before it,
190160	194480	because there are almost 2,000 separate bureaucracies administering land
194480	199440	that, were it a single country, would be in the top 10 list of biggest countries.
199440	203520	But in general, most of the federal land falls under the control of the president,
203520	208800	to whom a dozen secretaries report, of which we care about three, that run five departments.
208800	210400	First, the Department of Defense.
210400	214320	She runs military bases and nuclear silos and all the toys of war.
214320	217920	America has to keep them somewhere, and if sororicide taught her anything,
217920	220080	it's don't trust the states with weapons.
220080	222800	So keep them close on federal land she does.
222800	228000	While America's military is big, the Department of Defense holds the least land of the top five.
228000	229920	Next is the National Park Service.
229920	233040	The Grand Canyon and Yellowstone and Blue Ridge Mountains.
233040	237440	If there's an epic vista you visited or heard of in America, it's probably one of hers.
237440	241680	National Parks is the celebrity of the group and can really stand out.
241680	244000	Next biggest is the Fish and Wildlife Service.
244000	248240	Much less known, except if you're in Alaska, where 85% of her land is.
248240	251360	Fish and Wildlife is in the business of animal conservation,
251360	255920	keeping land for America's species under her aegis, not to be developed.
255920	261200	Then there's the Forest Service, often confused with national parks, but not remotely the same.
261200	265360	There's many a breathtaking national forest you can hike through, but they're not parks.
265360	270960	They're more America's resource tiles, least for logging, plus grassland tiles for grazing.
270960	274240	Forest Service's job is to balance extraction with maintenance.
274240	279040	How well she does this is an endless source of argument between America and the states
279040	281760	and the companies that want to use those resource tiles.
281760	285600	It's a job that guarantees someone is always going to be angry.
285600	287280	Only you can prevent forest fires?
287280	292880	That's the Forest Service, because she deals with these kinds of fires as well as these kinds of fires.
292880	298160	And it's a job she splits with the last and the biggest, the Bureau of Land Management.
298160	303280	She does it all, from resolving cow disputes, to leasing land for mining, to building parks,
303280	308240	to preserving the coastal waters of California, which surprise California, are federal land.
308240	314480	BLM does a lot and is the biggest, which can make it very confusing about which agency does what.
314480	315600	But think of it this way.
315600	316640	There are three goals.
316640	318640	Conservation, Recreation, Extraction.
318640	321360	BLM does all three, FS does Conservation and Extraction,
321360	324400	F&W does Conservation, NPS Conservation, Recreation.
324400	325520	Again, in general.
325520	329280	These four plus war control 97% of federal land.
329280	334160	The last 3% is miscellaneous, used by departments like the Postal Service or NASA
334160	336160	or the Department of Energy or others.
336160	340240	Okay, this is lovely, but like, what does it mean to say that land is federal?
340240	342160	Is it part of the state or not?
342160	347680	Well, this brings up the delicate and sensitive balance of power between the states and America.
347680	352400	And there's an enormous amount of words, words, words around the sovereignty of governments.
352400	357920	But ultimately, federal land belongs to America, and she can do with it what she wants,
357920	359760	and the states have to just suck it.
359760	364960	Most starkly in Nevada, where federal land was used for nuclear bomb testing.
364960	369840	Yeah, that's a pretty big hole you punched in Nevada, America.
370560	372160	Oh, not just the once.
378080	381760	When push comes to shove, America can shove.
381760	383680	That's the most extreme example.
383680	388080	But federal lands will often have their own separate federal law enforcement officers,
388080	392320	like the Investigative Services Branch, a kind of FBI for national parks.
392320	395600	Though state borders do matter here, for lesser crimes,
395600	399840	federal officers will often dump suspects into the state courts to deal with.
399840	402320	Private citizens can't buy property on federal land.
402320	405200	There are Americans who will tell you they live in a national park.
405200	409040	Cape Cod and Fire Island National Parks are examples of this.
409040	413520	But if you zoom into official maps, you'll often find hilarious borders
413520	417760	that swoop around and in between developed and undeveloped areas.
417760	422720	There's also military bases, which will have soldiers living in them, but they can't own anything.
422720	426640	And because it's federal land, the Department of Defense that builds the housing
426640	430160	can ignore all a state's laws about housing or health codes.
430160	434720	So a state can't control in a meaningful way federal land in her borders.
434720	438880	Hundreds of acres of federal grassland might suddenly be filled with grazing cattle,
438880	442160	or pow, be declared a national monument and preserved forever,
442160	444640	or plumbed for oil and mined for minerals,
444640	447760	with the state just standing on the sidelines, watching.
447760	452080	Thus, states can't build their own towns or parks or factories in federal land
452080	455280	to, you know, collect any taxes from the land.
455280	459600	Which, once America made her intention to keep federal land forever,
459600	463600	made the states with a lot of it start to grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.
463600	466480	Fine, I'll give you payment in lieu of taxes.
466480	467680	Are you happy now?
467680	469280	Is this a joke? Is this for real?
469280	470800	Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.
470800	473760	All of this means today there's a big political divide
473760	477680	between the states that have a lot of federal land and the states that don't.
477680	482400	With eastern states thinking of federal land as belonging to the nation as a whole.
482400	485600	Which is easy to do when you don't have a lot of it within your borders,
485600	489840	and federal land to you means visiting Glacier National Park on vacation.
489840	493520	Meanwhile, western states are getting nuclear bombs detonated in their backyards,
493520	499040	and compensation they don't think is fair for land that affects them that they can't control.
499040	503120	There's a million more complications this simplification can't possibly cover,
503120	507360	but the best way to think about federal land is that while it may be in a state,
507360	509360	it is not of the state.
