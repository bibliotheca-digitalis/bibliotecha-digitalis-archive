1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
The United States of America.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,960
You too, Hawaii and Alaska, to scale, for once.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,280
Ever since these states united to create America, the federal government of America,

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,760
they and she fought mightily over the land,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,600
which plains or forests or mountains or swamps to end up in each hand.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,680
On the map, it looks like states hold all the cards, but they don't.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,960
Just under one third of land in the United States is federal, but that's an average.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,200
Looking at the percent of federal land in the states, the wester we go, the federal are the land,

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,920
and the less of the state that's in each state.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
There's eastern states with under 1% federal land,

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,080
and five western states that control less than half of the land in their borders.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,520
How? What?

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
First thing first, how did this happen?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,400
America wasn't always the mighty united.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,320
Like us all, she started small, when states were young, new, and few,

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,720
giving away but little for her to play.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,240
But then America grew.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,520
Louisiana purchasing, Mexican sessioning, and manifest-destining her way across the continent.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
But in this age of empires, it won't do any good to say she owns the land,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,120
unless she gets her citizens out there to occupy the vast, totally unoccupied continent.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,920
So America turns from hoarder to minimalist,

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,800
disposing of as much of the land to new states and new settlers as she can.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,960
Sometimes giving it away in literal races, where plots of land were drawn,

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
homesteaders waited at a starting line, and bang, first family to a plot owns that plot.

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Says who?

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
Says America.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,920
She's booting up a private property ladder from virgin land, using contracts and guns.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,680
10% of all the land in the US was given away for free just to get people out west.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,000
See also railroad companies, which got the land either side of any track they could build

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,760
for the length of a continent.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,720
If you could live on or improve the land in the 1800s, America would probably give it to you.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,640
But by the 1900s, most of the states are mostly in place,

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,000
and the age of empires and wagons westward is over.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
But America still had a ton of land she didn't or couldn't give away.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,800
And now that the states are settled, well, what she has is all she will ever have.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,120
She turns away from her gifting minimalism and becomes a curator of her collection of land.

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
This change was rather a shock to states expecting the land

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,920
in their borders would be land in their borders.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,040
That federal land would continue to be turned over as it had for a century, but no.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
Thus this map and a lot of angry western states

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,440
now up against a fully operational federal government altering the deal.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,960
Some states like poor Utah and Nevada found themselves with hardly any state in their state.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Or, hey, hey, what about the reservations?

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Are you going to talk about them?

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
Are they federal land?

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Some of us have a lot of reservations in our state.

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,600
Ah, the reservations, yes.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,160
What a great story for another time.

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Look, we can't do the reservations right now.

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,960
We just can't.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,080
Okay, history aside, America has all this land now.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,600
But like, what is it for?

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
What is it for?

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,360
A lot.

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Almost all of the following will have an in general before it,

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,480
because there are almost 2,000 separate bureaucracies administering land

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,440
that, were it a single country, would be in the top 10 list of biggest countries.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,520
But in general, most of the federal land falls under the control of the president,

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,800
to whom a dozen secretaries report, of which we care about three, that run five departments.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
First, the Department of Defense.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,320
She runs military bases and nuclear silos and all the toys of war.

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,920
America has to keep them somewhere, and if sororicide taught her anything,

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
it's don't trust the states with weapons.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
So keep them close on federal land she does.

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,000
While America's military is big, the Department of Defense holds the least land of the top five.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
Next is the National Park Service.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
The Grand Canyon and Yellowstone and Blue Ridge Mountains.

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,440
If there's an epic vista you visited or heard of in America, it's probably one of hers.

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,680
National Parks is the celebrity of the group and can really stand out.

70
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
Next biggest is the Fish and Wildlife Service.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,240
Much less known, except if you're in Alaska, where 85% of her land is.

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,360
Fish and Wildlife is in the business of animal conservation,

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,920
keeping land for America's species under her aegis, not to be developed.

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,200
Then there's the Forest Service, often confused with national parks, but not remotely the same.

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,360
There's many a breathtaking national forest you can hike through, but they're not parks.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,960
They're more America's resource tiles, least for logging, plus grassland tiles for grazing.

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
Forest Service's job is to balance extraction with maintenance.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
How well she does this is an endless source of argument between America and the states

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,760
and the companies that want to use those resource tiles.

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,600
It's a job that guarantees someone is always going to be angry.

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
Only you can prevent forest fires?

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,880
That's the Forest Service, because she deals with these kinds of fires as well as these kinds of fires.

83
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,160
And it's a job she splits with the last and the biggest, the Bureau of Land Management.

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,280
She does it all, from resolving cow disputes, to leasing land for mining, to building parks,

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,240
to preserving the coastal waters of California, which surprise California, are federal land.

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,480
BLM does a lot and is the biggest, which can make it very confusing about which agency does what.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
But think of it this way.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
There are three goals.

89
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Conservation, Recreation, Extraction.

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,360
BLM does all three, FS does Conservation and Extraction,

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
F&W does Conservation, NPS Conservation, Recreation.

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
Again, in general.

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
These four plus war control 97% of federal land.

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,160
The last 3% is miscellaneous, used by departments like the Postal Service or NASA

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
or the Department of Energy or others.

96
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
Okay, this is lovely, but like, what does it mean to say that land is federal?

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
Is it part of the state or not?

98
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,680
Well, this brings up the delicate and sensitive balance of power between the states and America.

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
And there's an enormous amount of words, words, words around the sovereignty of governments.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,920
But ultimately, federal land belongs to America, and she can do with it what she wants,

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,760
and the states have to just suck it.

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,960
Most starkly in Nevada, where federal land was used for nuclear bomb testing.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
Yeah, that's a pretty big hole you punched in Nevada, America.

104
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Oh, not just the once.

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,760
When push comes to shove, America can shove.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,680
That's the most extreme example.

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,080
But federal lands will often have their own separate federal law enforcement officers,

108
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,320
like the Investigative Services Branch, a kind of FBI for national parks.

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,600
Though state borders do matter here, for lesser crimes,

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
federal officers will often dump suspects into the state courts to deal with.

111
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,320
Private citizens can't buy property on federal land.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,200
There are Americans who will tell you they live in a national park.

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,040
Cape Cod and Fire Island National Parks are examples of this.

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,520
But if you zoom into official maps, you'll often find hilarious borders

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,760
that swoop around and in between developed and undeveloped areas.

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,720
There's also military bases, which will have soldiers living in them, but they can't own anything.

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,640
And because it's federal land, the Department of Defense that builds the housing

118
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,160
can ignore all a state's laws about housing or health codes.

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,720
So a state can't control in a meaningful way federal land in her borders.

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Hundreds of acres of federal grassland might suddenly be filled with grazing cattle,

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,160
or pow, be declared a national monument and preserved forever,

122
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,640
or plumbed for oil and mined for minerals,

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,760
with the state just standing on the sidelines, watching.

124
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,080
Thus, states can't build their own towns or parks or factories in federal land

125
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
to, you know, collect any taxes from the land.

126
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,600
Which, once America made her intention to keep federal land forever,

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
made the states with a lot of it start to grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Fine, I'll give you payment in lieu of taxes.

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
Are you happy now?

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
Is this a joke? Is this for real?

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

132
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,760
All of this means today there's a big political divide

133
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,680
between the states that have a lot of federal land and the states that don't.

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,400
With eastern states thinking of federal land as belonging to the nation as a whole.

135
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
Which is easy to do when you don't have a lot of it within your borders,

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,840
and federal land to you means visiting Glacier National Park on vacation.

137
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
Meanwhile, western states are getting nuclear bombs detonated in their backyards,

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,040
and compensation they don't think is fair for land that affects them that they can't control.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,120
There's a million more complications this simplification can't possibly cover,

140
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
but the best way to think about federal land is that while it may be in a state,

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
it is not of the state.
