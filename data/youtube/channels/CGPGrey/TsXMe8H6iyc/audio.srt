1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Scandinavia. Look at this arctic wonderland. Fjords, saunas, fjords, looped fish, blondes,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,520
vikings, blond vikings? Fjords, Ikea, babies in government issued boxes, Santa, death metal,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,520
and fjords. But like where exactly are the borders of Scandinavia because not all of this stuff is

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,200
in it. Scandinavia is just three countries exactly. Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Three

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,520
kingdoms to be more precise. All of which are on the Scandinavian peninsula. Well except Denmark

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,080
and er plus Finland? Wait this doesn't help at all forget that. The three countries on this

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,440
peninsula can be collectively called Fennoscandia but if you do everyone will look at you weird

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,920
because no one except the nerdiest of geography nerds uses that word. Fennoscandia. So Scandinavia

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,200
is a term that's one part geography, one part history, and one part linguistics which is why

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,880
people will argue about who exactly is included. Finland is normally excluded because she used to

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,200
be considered one of the Baltic sisters with historical ties to mother Russia and Denmark

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,600
though on the other side of the sea is included because of her relationship it's complicated with

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Sweden. They've had something like 15 to 21 wars between them depending on how you want to count it

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,760
and it's complicated er because they mostly fought over Norway and who wouldn't she's beautiful and

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,800
rich. Anyway when outsiders say Scandinavia they probably mean the Nordic countries. That's these

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,240
three plus Finland and Iceland. Though you can hardly blame people for confusion when organizations

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,200
like the American Scandinavia Foundation lists everyone as members and all the Nordic countries

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,320
sometimes advertise abroad under the banner of Scandinavia anyway. This is the Holland approach

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
to international relations. If there's a fun name that everyone likes and keeps using wrongly just

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
go with it. The Nordic countries get along well enough that they've made an official union the

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,800
Nordic Council, a Viking cool kids club that other northern European places occasionally

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,520
unrealistically dream of joining. Though the Baltic sisters do get to sit with them but not

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,160
actually vote on anything. The Nordic Council is largely a collection of committees that tries to

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,280
get its members to cooperate on common problems like the arctic environment and social welfare

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,640
and business in the region and also finds time to make a surprisingly long and hilariously specific

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,520
list of rules for how their logo can be used including a respect distance the sovereignty

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
of which must not be violated. But the biggest deal of the Nordic Council is that citizens of

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,880
these five countries get to live and work in any of the others which if you've seen the EU video

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,240
adds yet another semi-overlapping bubble of complexity to an already complex region. The

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,240
immigration rule however doesn't apply to Icelandic horses which are one super adorables and two

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,960
banished from returning to Iceland should they ever leave but that's a story for another time.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,360
Now it wouldn't be a political union in Europe without some special territorial weirdness to

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,080
mention. Mainly Ã…land, an autonomous region of Finland that speaks Swedish and the Faroe Islands

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,040
and Greenland, both countries in the kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is really the odd girl out in

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,000
the Nordic club given that she's in the wrong hemisphere and that Greenlanders aren't historically

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,920
or linguistically related to nords. Also her flag ruins the otherwise consistent design motif but

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,640
she's part of Denmark because Vikings. Lastly there's Svalbard, an unincorporated territory

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
of Norway that must be mentioned because it has prepared for the apocalypse with a seed bank of

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,240
every plant to rebuild all of agriculture should it be necessary and it's also guarded by armored

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,680
bears. So that's that next time you say Scandinavia and you're not 100% sure who that includes just

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:36,800
say the Nordic countries instead.
