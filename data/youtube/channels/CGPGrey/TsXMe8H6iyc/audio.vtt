Scandinavia. Look at this arctic wonderland. Fjords, saunas, fjords, looped fish, blondes,

00:05.920 --> 00:11.520
vikings, blond vikings? Fjords, Ikea, babies in government issued boxes, Santa, death metal,

00:11.520 --> 00:17.520
and fjords. But like where exactly are the borders of Scandinavia because not all of this stuff is

00:17.520 --> 00:23.200
in it. Scandinavia is just three countries exactly. Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Three

00:23.200 --> 00:29.520
kingdoms to be more precise. All of which are on the Scandinavian peninsula. Well except Denmark

00:29.520 --> 00:34.080
and er plus Finland? Wait this doesn't help at all forget that. The three countries on this

00:34.080 --> 00:39.440
peninsula can be collectively called Fennoscandia but if you do everyone will look at you weird

00:39.440 --> 00:45.920
because no one except the nerdiest of geography nerds uses that word. Fennoscandia. So Scandinavia

00:45.920 --> 00:51.200
is a term that's one part geography, one part history, and one part linguistics which is why

00:51.200 --> 00:56.880
people will argue about who exactly is included. Finland is normally excluded because she used to

00:56.880 --> 01:01.200
be considered one of the Baltic sisters with historical ties to mother Russia and Denmark

01:01.200 --> 01:05.600
though on the other side of the sea is included because of her relationship it's complicated with

01:05.600 --> 01:11.600
Sweden. They've had something like 15 to 21 wars between them depending on how you want to count it

01:11.600 --> 01:17.760
and it's complicated er because they mostly fought over Norway and who wouldn't she's beautiful and

01:17.760 --> 01:22.800
rich. Anyway when outsiders say Scandinavia they probably mean the Nordic countries. That's these

01:22.800 --> 01:28.240
three plus Finland and Iceland. Though you can hardly blame people for confusion when organizations

01:28.240 --> 01:33.200
like the American Scandinavia Foundation lists everyone as members and all the Nordic countries

01:33.200 --> 01:38.320
sometimes advertise abroad under the banner of Scandinavia anyway. This is the Holland approach

01:38.320 --> 01:43.200
to international relations. If there's a fun name that everyone likes and keeps using wrongly just

01:43.200 --> 01:47.360
go with it. The Nordic countries get along well enough that they've made an official union the

01:47.360 --> 01:52.800
Nordic Council, a Viking cool kids club that other northern European places occasionally

01:52.800 --> 01:57.520
unrealistically dream of joining. Though the Baltic sisters do get to sit with them but not

01:57.520 --> 02:02.160
actually vote on anything. The Nordic Council is largely a collection of committees that tries to

02:02.160 --> 02:07.280
get its members to cooperate on common problems like the arctic environment and social welfare

02:07.280 --> 02:12.640
and business in the region and also finds time to make a surprisingly long and hilariously specific

02:12.640 --> 02:17.520
list of rules for how their logo can be used including a respect distance the sovereignty

02:17.520 --> 02:21.680
of which must not be violated. But the biggest deal of the Nordic Council is that citizens of

02:21.680 --> 02:26.880
these five countries get to live and work in any of the others which if you've seen the EU video

02:26.880 --> 02:32.240
adds yet another semi-overlapping bubble of complexity to an already complex region. The

02:32.240 --> 02:38.240
immigration rule however doesn't apply to Icelandic horses which are one super adorables and two

02:38.240 --> 02:42.960
banished from returning to Iceland should they ever leave but that's a story for another time.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.360
Now it wouldn't be a political union in Europe without some special territorial weirdness to

02:47.360 --> 02:52.080
mention. Mainly Ã…land, an autonomous region of Finland that speaks Swedish and the Faroe Islands

02:52.080 --> 02:57.040
and Greenland, both countries in the kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is really the odd girl out in

02:57.040 --> 03:02.000
the Nordic club given that she's in the wrong hemisphere and that Greenlanders aren't historically

03:02.000 --> 03:07.920
or linguistically related to nords. Also her flag ruins the otherwise consistent design motif but

03:07.920 --> 03:12.640
she's part of Denmark because Vikings. Lastly there's Svalbard, an unincorporated territory

03:12.640 --> 03:17.200
of Norway that must be mentioned because it has prepared for the apocalypse with a seed bank of

03:17.200 --> 03:22.240
every plant to rebuild all of agriculture should it be necessary and it's also guarded by armored

03:22.240 --> 03:27.680
bears. So that's that next time you say Scandinavia and you're not 100% sure who that includes just

03:27.680 --> 03:36.800
say the Nordic countries instead.
