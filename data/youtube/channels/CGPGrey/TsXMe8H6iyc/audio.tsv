0	5920	Scandinavia. Look at this arctic wonderland. Fjords, saunas, fjords, looped fish, blondes,
5920	11520	vikings, blond vikings? Fjords, Ikea, babies in government issued boxes, Santa, death metal,
11520	17520	and fjords. But like where exactly are the borders of Scandinavia because not all of this stuff is
17520	23200	in it. Scandinavia is just three countries exactly. Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Three
23200	29520	kingdoms to be more precise. All of which are on the Scandinavian peninsula. Well except Denmark
29520	34080	and er plus Finland? Wait this doesn't help at all forget that. The three countries on this
34080	39440	peninsula can be collectively called Fennoscandia but if you do everyone will look at you weird
39440	45920	because no one except the nerdiest of geography nerds uses that word. Fennoscandia. So Scandinavia
45920	51200	is a term that's one part geography, one part history, and one part linguistics which is why
51200	56880	people will argue about who exactly is included. Finland is normally excluded because she used to
56880	61200	be considered one of the Baltic sisters with historical ties to mother Russia and Denmark
61200	65600	though on the other side of the sea is included because of her relationship it's complicated with
65600	71600	Sweden. They've had something like 15 to 21 wars between them depending on how you want to count it
71600	77760	and it's complicated er because they mostly fought over Norway and who wouldn't she's beautiful and
77760	82800	rich. Anyway when outsiders say Scandinavia they probably mean the Nordic countries. That's these
82800	88240	three plus Finland and Iceland. Though you can hardly blame people for confusion when organizations
88240	93200	like the American Scandinavia Foundation lists everyone as members and all the Nordic countries
93200	98320	sometimes advertise abroad under the banner of Scandinavia anyway. This is the Holland approach
98320	103200	to international relations. If there's a fun name that everyone likes and keeps using wrongly just
103200	107360	go with it. The Nordic countries get along well enough that they've made an official union the
107360	112800	Nordic Council, a Viking cool kids club that other northern European places occasionally
112800	117520	unrealistically dream of joining. Though the Baltic sisters do get to sit with them but not
117520	122160	actually vote on anything. The Nordic Council is largely a collection of committees that tries to
122160	127280	get its members to cooperate on common problems like the arctic environment and social welfare
127280	132640	and business in the region and also finds time to make a surprisingly long and hilariously specific
132640	137520	list of rules for how their logo can be used including a respect distance the sovereignty
137520	141680	of which must not be violated. But the biggest deal of the Nordic Council is that citizens of
141680	146880	these five countries get to live and work in any of the others which if you've seen the EU video
146880	152240	adds yet another semi-overlapping bubble of complexity to an already complex region. The
152240	158240	immigration rule however doesn't apply to Icelandic horses which are one super adorables and two
158240	162960	banished from returning to Iceland should they ever leave but that's a story for another time.
162960	167360	Now it wouldn't be a political union in Europe without some special territorial weirdness to
167360	172080	mention. Mainly Ã…land, an autonomous region of Finland that speaks Swedish and the Faroe Islands
172080	177040	and Greenland, both countries in the kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is really the odd girl out in
177040	182000	the Nordic club given that she's in the wrong hemisphere and that Greenlanders aren't historically
182000	187920	or linguistically related to nords. Also her flag ruins the otherwise consistent design motif but
187920	192640	she's part of Denmark because Vikings. Lastly there's Svalbard, an unincorporated territory
192640	197200	of Norway that must be mentioned because it has prepared for the apocalypse with a seed bank of
197200	202240	every plant to rebuild all of agriculture should it be necessary and it's also guarded by armored
202240	207680	bears. So that's that next time you say Scandinavia and you're not 100% sure who that includes just
207680	216800	say the Nordic countries instead.
