00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
In my Animal Misconceptions video, I casually mentioned that daddy longlegs aren't spiders

00:04.040 --> 00:07.280
and received a ton of comments asking for clarification or suggesting that it's not

00:07.280 --> 00:08.280
that simple.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.960
So I feel the need to clear things up a little bit.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.300
But first, a disclaimer.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.460
If images of spiders make you uncomfortable, one, you shouldn't have clicked this video

00:14.460 --> 00:17.760
and two, you should stop watching right about now.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.840
Cutest spider ever, right?

00:19.840 --> 00:22.980
When editing the video, I decided to cut out a daddy longlegs discussion and now you'll

00:22.980 --> 00:23.980
see why.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.820
To answer the question, are daddy longlegs spiders, we first need to know what are spiders.

00:27.820 --> 00:31.700
And for that, we need the biological classification system you should have learned in high school.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.660
Spiders are in the animal kingdom, which is a pretty broad class of life and not helpful

00:34.660 --> 00:36.140
in narrowing things down.

00:36.140 --> 00:39.580
The phylum that concerns us are the arthropods, which are a subset of animals with external

00:39.580 --> 00:41.980
skeletons, segmented bodies and jointed limbs.

00:41.980 --> 00:45.420
The arthropods with exactly eight legs and two body segments are in a class called arachnids,

00:45.420 --> 00:47.140
the name where arachnophobia comes from.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.220
And while often used to mean fear of spiders, there are plenty of arachnids that are not

00:50.220 --> 00:51.980
spiders, such as scorpions and mites.

00:51.980 --> 00:55.180
The true spiders are a subset of arachnids in the order of araneae.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.500
What defines these as spiders are their fangs, the poison glands within them, their numerous

00:58.500 --> 01:01.080
eyes and their spinnerets that allow them to make webs.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.420
Now that we have a spider checklist, on to the second problem.

01:03.420 --> 01:06.460
The name daddy longlegs means different things in different places.

01:06.460 --> 01:09.740
In Australia this seller spider is called a daddy longlegs which, as an eight legged

01:09.740 --> 01:13.140
multi-eyed web spinning member of araneae makes it an official spider.

01:13.140 --> 01:16.700
It also produces venom, but then so does everything in that bloody country.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.420
Where I grew up, this is a daddy longlegs, sometimes called a harvestman.

01:19.420 --> 01:23.800
They have just two, soulless eyes, can't web sling and lack fangs and poison glands and

01:23.800 --> 01:27.360
so fail the spider checklist and are in a different order called opiliones.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.560
It was these that I had in mind while making the video.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.880
To make things more complicated, in my adoptive UK the British call this cranefly daddy longlegs.

01:33.880 --> 01:38.160
Unlike the closely related opiliones and araneae, the cranefly isn't an arachnid but an insect,

01:38.160 --> 01:41.160
the class of arthropods with six legs and three body segments.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.360
And as if the name wasn't ambiguous enough at this point, there is also a plant called

01:44.360 --> 01:45.560
daddy longlegs.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.820
For taxonomical completeness, the plant is over here in a different kingdom.

01:48.820 --> 01:51.760
But because of the way life works, even this plant is distantly related to those other

01:51.760 --> 01:55.040
daddy longlegs because plants and animals are both eukaryotes, which means that their

01:55.040 --> 01:57.980
cells have complex structures, most notably a nucleus.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.000
So to fully answer the first question, there are four daddy longlegs, three animals, two

02:02.000 --> 02:04.200
arachnids, but only one spider among them.
