0	4040	In my Animal Misconceptions video, I casually mentioned that daddy longlegs aren't spiders
4040	7280	and received a ton of comments asking for clarification or suggesting that it's not
7280	8280	that simple.
8280	9960	So I feel the need to clear things up a little bit.
9960	11300	But first, a disclaimer.
11300	14460	If images of spiders make you uncomfortable, one, you shouldn't have clicked this video
14460	17760	and two, you should stop watching right about now.
17760	19840	Cutest spider ever, right?
19840	22980	When editing the video, I decided to cut out a daddy longlegs discussion and now you'll
22980	23980	see why.
23980	27820	To answer the question, are daddy longlegs spiders, we first need to know what are spiders.
27820	31700	And for that, we need the biological classification system you should have learned in high school.
31700	34660	Spiders are in the animal kingdom, which is a pretty broad class of life and not helpful
34660	36140	in narrowing things down.
36140	39580	The phylum that concerns us are the arthropods, which are a subset of animals with external
39580	41980	skeletons, segmented bodies and jointed limbs.
41980	45420	The arthropods with exactly eight legs and two body segments are in a class called arachnids,
45420	47140	the name where arachnophobia comes from.
47140	50220	And while often used to mean fear of spiders, there are plenty of arachnids that are not
50220	51980	spiders, such as scorpions and mites.
51980	55180	The true spiders are a subset of arachnids in the order of araneae.
55180	58500	What defines these as spiders are their fangs, the poison glands within them, their numerous
58500	61080	eyes and their spinnerets that allow them to make webs.
61080	63420	Now that we have a spider checklist, on to the second problem.
63420	66460	The name daddy longlegs means different things in different places.
66460	69740	In Australia this seller spider is called a daddy longlegs which, as an eight legged
69740	73140	multi-eyed web spinning member of araneae makes it an official spider.
73140	76700	It also produces venom, but then so does everything in that bloody country.
76700	79420	Where I grew up, this is a daddy longlegs, sometimes called a harvestman.
79420	83800	They have just two, soulless eyes, can't web sling and lack fangs and poison glands and
83800	87360	so fail the spider checklist and are in a different order called opiliones.
87360	89560	It was these that I had in mind while making the video.
89560	93880	To make things more complicated, in my adoptive UK the British call this cranefly daddy longlegs.
93880	98160	Unlike the closely related opiliones and araneae, the cranefly isn't an arachnid but an insect,
98160	101160	the class of arthropods with six legs and three body segments.
101160	104360	And as if the name wasn't ambiguous enough at this point, there is also a plant called
104360	105560	daddy longlegs.
105560	108820	For taxonomical completeness, the plant is over here in a different kingdom.
108820	111760	But because of the way life works, even this plant is distantly related to those other
111760	115040	daddy longlegs because plants and animals are both eukaryotes, which means that their
115040	117980	cells have complex structures, most notably a nucleus.
117980	122000	So to fully answer the first question, there are four daddy longlegs, three animals, two
122000	124200	arachnids, but only one spider among them.
