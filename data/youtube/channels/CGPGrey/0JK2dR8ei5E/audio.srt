00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
In my Animal Misconceptions video, I casually mentioned that daddy longlegs aren't spiders

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,280
and received a ton of comments asking for clarification or suggesting that it's not

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
that simple.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,960
So I feel the need to clear things up a little bit.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,300
But first, a disclaimer.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,460
If images of spiders make you uncomfortable, one, you shouldn't have clicked this video

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,760
and two, you should stop watching right about now.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
Cutest spider ever, right?

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,980
When editing the video, I decided to cut out a daddy longlegs discussion and now you'll

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
see why.

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,820
To answer the question, are daddy longlegs spiders, we first need to know what are spiders.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,700
And for that, we need the biological classification system you should have learned in high school.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,660
Spiders are in the animal kingdom, which is a pretty broad class of life and not helpful

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,140
in narrowing things down.

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,580
The phylum that concerns us are the arthropods, which are a subset of animals with external

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,980
skeletons, segmented bodies and jointed limbs.

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,420
The arthropods with exactly eight legs and two body segments are in a class called arachnids,

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,140
the name where arachnophobia comes from.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,220
And while often used to mean fear of spiders, there are plenty of arachnids that are not

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,980
spiders, such as scorpions and mites.

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,180
The true spiders are a subset of arachnids in the order of araneae.

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,500
What defines these as spiders are their fangs, the poison glands within them, their numerous

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,080
eyes and their spinnerets that allow them to make webs.

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,420
Now that we have a spider checklist, on to the second problem.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,460
The name daddy longlegs means different things in different places.

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,740
In Australia this seller spider is called a daddy longlegs which, as an eight legged

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,140
multi-eyed web spinning member of araneae makes it an official spider.

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,700
It also produces venom, but then so does everything in that bloody country.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,420
Where I grew up, this is a daddy longlegs, sometimes called a harvestman.

30
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,800
They have just two, soulless eyes, can't web sling and lack fangs and poison glands and

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,360
so fail the spider checklist and are in a different order called opiliones.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,560
It was these that I had in mind while making the video.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,880
To make things more complicated, in my adoptive UK the British call this cranefly daddy longlegs.

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
Unlike the closely related opiliones and araneae, the cranefly isn't an arachnid but an insect,

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,160
the class of arthropods with six legs and three body segments.

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,360
And as if the name wasn't ambiguous enough at this point, there is also a plant called

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,560
daddy longlegs.

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,820
For taxonomical completeness, the plant is over here in a different kingdom.

39
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,760
But because of the way life works, even this plant is distantly related to those other

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,040
daddy longlegs because plants and animals are both eukaryotes, which means that their

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,980
cells have complex structures, most notably a nucleus.

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,000
So to fully answer the first question, there are four daddy longlegs, three animals, two

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,200
arachnids, but only one spider among them.
