00:00.000 --> 00:04.780
The origin of copyright law takes us back to 1710 and Queen Anne, the monarch who had

00:04.780 --> 00:09.240
just overseen the unification of England and Scotland into the then brand new Great Britain.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.780
Also on her busy schedule was the Statute of Anne, the very first copyright law.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.960
It gave authors control over who could make copies of their books or build on their work

00:15.960 --> 00:17.520
for a limited period of time.

00:17.520 --> 00:21.080
Later, a group of rebellious colonists thought that the Statute of Anne was a good idea and

00:21.080 --> 00:25.540
so copy-pasted it into their own constitution, giving Congress the power to promote the progress

00:25.540 --> 00:28.780
of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right

00:28.780 --> 00:30.300
to their respective writings.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.500
Basically, copyright is a contract between authors and society.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.540
If you promise to make more stuff, we promise not to copy it or build on it for 28 years.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.380
Here's an example from the modern day.

00:39.380 --> 00:42.060
Let's say you're trying to be a director and you're looking for a project to get

00:42.060 --> 00:43.260
started.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.460
Harry Potter is a story you'd love to remake, but since J.K.

00:45.460 --> 00:49.380
Rowling published The Sorcerer's Stone in the United States in 1998, it still has copyright

00:49.380 --> 00:51.020
protection so you can't use it.

00:51.020 --> 00:53.540
Instead, you need to find something from a long time ago.

00:53.540 --> 00:58.540
For example, George Lucas released Star Wars A New Hope in 1977.

00:58.540 --> 01:01.220
That's more than 28 years ago, so great, get filming.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.740
Alas, no.

01:02.740 --> 01:06.820
While Star Wars should have lost copyright protection in 2005, it's actually copyrighted

01:06.820 --> 01:11.620
until 95 years after publication, not 28.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.120
So you can't use it unless Lucas lets you.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.940
Why does his copyright last for ages?

01:15.940 --> 01:19.400
Well, as long as there has been copyright, there have been authors arguing that it's

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
too short.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
And perhaps they're right.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.140
How's a poor guy like Lucas supposed to turn a profit in the mere 28 years between

01:24.140 --> 01:26.400
1977 and 2005?

01:26.400 --> 01:29.040
After all, there was only the theatrical release of A New Hope.

01:29.040 --> 01:35.400
And the theatrical re-release in 1978, and again in 1979, and 1981, and 1982.

01:35.400 --> 01:39.840
And then there was the 1982 VHS and Betamax releases, the 1984 broadcast television release,

01:39.840 --> 01:45.080
the 1985 laserdisc release, the 1989 widescreen laserdisc release, the 1990 VHS re-release,

01:45.080 --> 01:51.000
the 1992 widescreen VHS release, the 1993 laserdisc re-release, the 1995 VHS re-re-release,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.920
the 1997 special edition theatrical release, Hunchot First You Bastard, the 1997 VHS special

01:55.920 --> 01:58.680
edition release, and the 2004 DVD release.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.300
And now you, dear filmmaker, come along and want to make your own version of Star Wars

02:02.300 --> 02:03.920
A New Hope for shame.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.280
That's like stealing food right out of George Lucas's mouth.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.320
Four times Congress has agreed with authors that the length of copyright is too short

02:10.320 --> 02:12.640
to turn a profit and has so extended it.

02:12.640 --> 02:18.760
First in 1831 from 28 years to 42 years, then again in 1909 to 56 years, in 1976 to the

02:18.760 --> 02:22.800
lifetime of the author plus 50 years, and in 1998 to the lifetime of the author plus

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
70 years.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.840
That's a great deal for authors who have already made stuff, but does it really help society

02:26.840 --> 02:28.440
get more books and movies?

02:28.440 --> 02:31.540
It's hard to imagine, for example, that Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing A Princess

02:31.540 --> 02:35.580
of Mars and Tarzan in 1911 because the copyright laws had just been extended and would not

02:35.580 --> 02:37.080
have done so otherwise.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
Or that J.K.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.680
Rowling, while living on benefits in Scotland, was busy doing the math and wouldn't have

02:40.680 --> 02:44.680
written Harry Potter if the copyright protection was just for her whole life and not an additional

02:44.680 --> 02:46.840
seven decades thereafter.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.600
Because exactly who needs incentives after they're dead?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.860
Dead is the point at which literally no incentives in the whole universe can compel you to write

02:53.020 --> 02:54.340
one more screenplay.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.340
Because you're dead.

02:55.340 --> 02:56.340
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

02:56.340 --> 03:00.340
If you're the kind of person who is only motivated by plans that unravel after your

03:00.340 --> 03:03.380
demise, you're either amazingly awesome or deranged.

03:03.380 --> 03:04.380
But so what?

03:04.380 --> 03:08.260
So what if every kindergartener's macaroni artwork is protected by copyright for 175

03:08.260 --> 03:09.260
years?

03:09.260 --> 03:10.260
Why does it matter?

03:10.260 --> 03:13.360
Because the main beneficiaries of copyright after death are not the authors or society,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.480
but companies.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.480
Companies like Disney.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.460
Remember all the old good Disney movies?

03:17.460 --> 03:21.120
Yeah, all of them came from works no longer under copyright protection at the time.

03:21.120 --> 03:25.160
The whole of the Disney empire and the childhood magic that it produces only exists because

03:25.160 --> 03:28.520
there was copyright-free work for Walt Disney, you know, the guy who actually started the

03:28.520 --> 03:30.360
whole company, to rework and update.

03:30.360 --> 03:34.080
But the corporate, Walt as Disney, was the big pusher of the 1998 Life Plus 70 Years

03:34.080 --> 03:35.460
copyright extension.

03:35.460 --> 03:38.280
It made sure that no one could make a more popular version of their movies in the same

03:38.280 --> 03:41.020
way they made a more popular version of Alice in Wonderland.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.200
This near-infinite control subverts the whole purpose of copyright, which is to promote

03:44.200 --> 03:47.780
the creation of more books and movies, not to give companies the power to stop people

03:47.780 --> 03:51.300
making new creative works based on the efforts of their long-dead founders.

03:51.300 --> 03:54.840
New directors and authors need the freedom to take what came before and remake and remix.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.180
And they should be able to use the creative material from their own lifetimes to do so,

03:58.180 --> 04:01.180
not just be limited to the work of previous generations.

04:01.180 --> 04:04.760
At the end of the century, George Lucas romped upon civilization a new word.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.120
Antisappointment.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.100
The tremendous letdown that was the lazy, bland, and soulless new trilogy.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.860
George Lucas was completely within his right to make those movies into the sterile, toy-marketing

04:13.860 --> 04:15.380
vehicles they were.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.460
He owned Darth Vader and could tell the origin story as he wished.

04:18.460 --> 04:21.540
But imagine for a moment if copyright still worked as first intended.

04:21.540 --> 04:26.460
In 2011, the whole of the original Star Wars trilogy—all of its artwork, its characters,

04:26.460 --> 04:30.360
its music—would have left copyright protection and been available to aspiring directors and

04:30.360 --> 04:33.120
writers to build upon and make their own versions of.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.860
There would have been a treasure trove of new Star Wars stories for fans to enjoy.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.000
But as long as the current copyright laws remain as they are, no living person will

04:40.000 --> 04:44.620
ever get to tell a Darth Vader story, or a Harry Potter story, or a Hobbit story, or

04:44.660 --> 04:48.180
any other story that matters to them that the author or, when they're dead, their

04:48.180 --> 04:49.420
company disagrees with.
