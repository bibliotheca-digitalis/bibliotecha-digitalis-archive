1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
The origin of copyright law takes us back to 1710 and Queen Anne, the monarch who had

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,240
just overseen the unification of England and Scotland into the then brand new Great Britain.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,780
Also on her busy schedule was the Statute of Anne, the very first copyright law.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,960
It gave authors control over who could make copies of their books or build on their work

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,520
for a limited period of time.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,080
Later, a group of rebellious colonists thought that the Statute of Anne was a good idea and

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,540
so copy-pasted it into their own constitution, giving Congress the power to promote the progress

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,780
of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,300
to their respective writings.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,500
Basically, copyright is a contract between authors and society.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,540
If you promise to make more stuff, we promise not to copy it or build on it for 28 years.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,380
Here's an example from the modern day.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,060
Let's say you're trying to be a director and you're looking for a project to get

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,260
started.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,460
Harry Potter is a story you'd love to remake, but since J.K.

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,380
Rowling published The Sorcerer's Stone in the United States in 1998, it still has copyright

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,020
protection so you can't use it.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,540
Instead, you need to find something from a long time ago.

19
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,540
For example, George Lucas released Star Wars A New Hope in 1977.

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,220
That's more than 28 years ago, so great, get filming.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,740
Alas, no.

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,820
While Star Wars should have lost copyright protection in 2005, it's actually copyrighted

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,620
until 95 years after publication, not 28.

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,120
So you can't use it unless Lucas lets you.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,940
Why does his copyright last for ages?

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,400
Well, as long as there has been copyright, there have been authors arguing that it's

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
too short.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
And perhaps they're right.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,140
How's a poor guy like Lucas supposed to turn a profit in the mere 28 years between

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,400
1977 and 2005?

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
After all, there was only the theatrical release of A New Hope.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,400
And the theatrical re-release in 1978, and again in 1979, and 1981, and 1982.

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,840
And then there was the 1982 VHS and Betamax releases, the 1984 broadcast television release,

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,080
the 1985 laserdisc release, the 1989 widescreen laserdisc release, the 1990 VHS re-release,

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,000
the 1992 widescreen VHS release, the 1993 laserdisc re-release, the 1995 VHS re-re-release,

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,920
the 1997 special edition theatrical release, Hunchot First You Bastard, the 1997 VHS special

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
edition release, and the 2004 DVD release.

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,300
And now you, dear filmmaker, come along and want to make your own version of Star Wars

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,920
A New Hope for shame.

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,280
That's like stealing food right out of George Lucas's mouth.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,320
Four times Congress has agreed with authors that the length of copyright is too short

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,640
to turn a profit and has so extended it.

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,760
First in 1831 from 28 years to 42 years, then again in 1909 to 56 years, in 1976 to the

44
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,800
lifetime of the author plus 50 years, and in 1998 to the lifetime of the author plus

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
70 years.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,840
That's a great deal for authors who have already made stuff, but does it really help society

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,440
get more books and movies?

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,540
It's hard to imagine, for example, that Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing A Princess

49
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,580
of Mars and Tarzan in 1911 because the copyright laws had just been extended and would not

50
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,080
have done so otherwise.

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Or that J.K.

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,680
Rowling, while living on benefits in Scotland, was busy doing the math and wouldn't have

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,680
written Harry Potter if the copyright protection was just for her whole life and not an additional

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,840
seven decades thereafter.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,600
Because exactly who needs incentives after they're dead?

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,860
Dead is the point at which literally no incentives in the whole universe can compel you to write

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,340
one more screenplay.

58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Because you're dead.

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,340
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,340
If you're the kind of person who is only motivated by plans that unravel after your

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,380
demise, you're either amazingly awesome or deranged.

62
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
But so what?

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,260
So what if every kindergartener's macaroni artwork is protected by copyright for 175

64
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
years?

65
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Why does it matter?

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,360
Because the main beneficiaries of copyright after death are not the authors or society,

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,480
but companies.

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
Companies like Disney.

69
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,460
Remember all the old good Disney movies?

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,120
Yeah, all of them came from works no longer under copyright protection at the time.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,160
The whole of the Disney empire and the childhood magic that it produces only exists because

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,520
there was copyright-free work for Walt Disney, you know, the guy who actually started the

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,360
whole company, to rework and update.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,080
But the corporate, Walt as Disney, was the big pusher of the 1998 Life Plus 70 Years

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,460
copyright extension.

76
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,280
It made sure that no one could make a more popular version of their movies in the same

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,020
way they made a more popular version of Alice in Wonderland.

78
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,200
This near-infinite control subverts the whole purpose of copyright, which is to promote

79
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,780
the creation of more books and movies, not to give companies the power to stop people

80
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,300
making new creative works based on the efforts of their long-dead founders.

81
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,840
New directors and authors need the freedom to take what came before and remake and remix.

82
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,180
And they should be able to use the creative material from their own lifetimes to do so,

83
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,180
not just be limited to the work of previous generations.

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,760
At the end of the century, George Lucas romped upon civilization a new word.

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,120
Antisappointment.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,100
The tremendous letdown that was the lazy, bland, and soulless new trilogy.

87
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,860
George Lucas was completely within his right to make those movies into the sterile, toy-marketing

88
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,380
vehicles they were.

89
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,460
He owned Darth Vader and could tell the origin story as he wished.

90
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,540
But imagine for a moment if copyright still worked as first intended.

91
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,460
In 2011, the whole of the original Star Wars trilogy—all of its artwork, its characters,

92
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,360
its music—would have left copyright protection and been available to aspiring directors and

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,120
writers to build upon and make their own versions of.

94
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,860
There would have been a treasure trove of new Star Wars stories for fans to enjoy.

95
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,000
But as long as the current copyright laws remain as they are, no living person will

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,620
ever get to tell a Darth Vader story, or a Harry Potter story, or a Hobbit story, or

97
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,180
any other story that matters to them that the author or, when they're dead, their

98
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,420
company disagrees with.
