0	4780	The origin of copyright law takes us back to 1710 and Queen Anne, the monarch who had
4780	9240	just overseen the unification of England and Scotland into the then brand new Great Britain.
9240	12780	Also on her busy schedule was the Statute of Anne, the very first copyright law.
12780	15960	It gave authors control over who could make copies of their books or build on their work
15960	17520	for a limited period of time.
17520	21080	Later, a group of rebellious colonists thought that the Statute of Anne was a good idea and
21080	25540	so copy-pasted it into their own constitution, giving Congress the power to promote the progress
25540	28780	of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right
28780	30300	to their respective writings.
30300	33500	Basically, copyright is a contract between authors and society.
33500	37540	If you promise to make more stuff, we promise not to copy it or build on it for 28 years.
37540	39380	Here's an example from the modern day.
39380	42060	Let's say you're trying to be a director and you're looking for a project to get
42060	43260	started.
43260	45460	Harry Potter is a story you'd love to remake, but since J.K.
45460	49380	Rowling published The Sorcerer's Stone in the United States in 1998, it still has copyright
49380	51020	protection so you can't use it.
51020	53540	Instead, you need to find something from a long time ago.
53540	58540	For example, George Lucas released Star Wars A New Hope in 1977.
58540	61220	That's more than 28 years ago, so great, get filming.
61220	62740	Alas, no.
62740	66820	While Star Wars should have lost copyright protection in 2005, it's actually copyrighted
66820	71620	until 95 years after publication, not 28.
71620	74120	So you can't use it unless Lucas lets you.
74120	75940	Why does his copyright last for ages?
75940	79400	Well, as long as there has been copyright, there have been authors arguing that it's
79400	80400	too short.
80400	81400	And perhaps they're right.
81400	84140	How's a poor guy like Lucas supposed to turn a profit in the mere 28 years between
84140	86400	1977 and 2005?
86400	89040	After all, there was only the theatrical release of A New Hope.
89040	95400	And the theatrical re-release in 1978, and again in 1979, and 1981, and 1982.
95400	99840	And then there was the 1982 VHS and Betamax releases, the 1984 broadcast television release,
99840	105080	the 1985 laserdisc release, the 1989 widescreen laserdisc release, the 1990 VHS re-release,
105080	111000	the 1992 widescreen VHS release, the 1993 laserdisc re-release, the 1995 VHS re-re-release,
111000	115920	the 1997 special edition theatrical release, Hunchot First You Bastard, the 1997 VHS special
115920	118680	edition release, and the 2004 DVD release.
118680	122300	And now you, dear filmmaker, come along and want to make your own version of Star Wars
122300	123920	A New Hope for shame.
123920	127280	That's like stealing food right out of George Lucas's mouth.
127280	130320	Four times Congress has agreed with authors that the length of copyright is too short
130320	132640	to turn a profit and has so extended it.
132640	138760	First in 1831 from 28 years to 42 years, then again in 1909 to 56 years, in 1976 to the
138760	142800	lifetime of the author plus 50 years, and in 1998 to the lifetime of the author plus
142800	143800	70 years.
143960	146840	That's a great deal for authors who have already made stuff, but does it really help society
146840	148440	get more books and movies?
148440	151540	It's hard to imagine, for example, that Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing A Princess
151540	155580	of Mars and Tarzan in 1911 because the copyright laws had just been extended and would not
155580	157080	have done so otherwise.
157080	158080	Or that J.K.
158080	160680	Rowling, while living on benefits in Scotland, was busy doing the math and wouldn't have
160680	164680	written Harry Potter if the copyright protection was just for her whole life and not an additional
164680	166840	seven decades thereafter.
166840	169600	Because exactly who needs incentives after they're dead?
169600	172860	Dead is the point at which literally no incentives in the whole universe can compel you to write
173020	174340	one more screenplay.
174340	175340	Because you're dead.
175340	176340	Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
176340	180340	If you're the kind of person who is only motivated by plans that unravel after your
180340	183380	demise, you're either amazingly awesome or deranged.
183380	184380	But so what?
184380	188260	So what if every kindergartener's macaroni artwork is protected by copyright for 175
188260	189260	years?
189260	190260	Why does it matter?
190260	193360	Because the main beneficiaries of copyright after death are not the authors or society,
193360	194480	but companies.
194480	195480	Companies like Disney.
195480	197460	Remember all the old good Disney movies?
197460	201120	Yeah, all of them came from works no longer under copyright protection at the time.
201120	205160	The whole of the Disney empire and the childhood magic that it produces only exists because
205160	208520	there was copyright-free work for Walt Disney, you know, the guy who actually started the
208520	210360	whole company, to rework and update.
210360	214080	But the corporate, Walt as Disney, was the big pusher of the 1998 Life Plus 70 Years
214080	215460	copyright extension.
215460	218280	It made sure that no one could make a more popular version of their movies in the same
218280	221020	way they made a more popular version of Alice in Wonderland.
221020	224200	This near-infinite control subverts the whole purpose of copyright, which is to promote
224200	227780	the creation of more books and movies, not to give companies the power to stop people
227780	231300	making new creative works based on the efforts of their long-dead founders.
231300	234840	New directors and authors need the freedom to take what came before and remake and remix.
234840	238180	And they should be able to use the creative material from their own lifetimes to do so,
238180	241180	not just be limited to the work of previous generations.
241180	244760	At the end of the century, George Lucas romped upon civilization a new word.
244760	246120	Antisappointment.
246120	250100	The tremendous letdown that was the lazy, bland, and soulless new trilogy.
250100	253860	George Lucas was completely within his right to make those movies into the sterile, toy-marketing
253860	255380	vehicles they were.
255380	258460	He owned Darth Vader and could tell the origin story as he wished.
258460	261540	But imagine for a moment if copyright still worked as first intended.
261540	266460	In 2011, the whole of the original Star Wars trilogy—all of its artwork, its characters,
266460	270360	its music—would have left copyright protection and been available to aspiring directors and
270360	273120	writers to build upon and make their own versions of.
273120	276860	There would have been a treasure trove of new Star Wars stories for fans to enjoy.
276860	280000	But as long as the current copyright laws remain as they are, no living person will
280000	284620	ever get to tell a Darth Vader story, or a Harry Potter story, or a Hobbit story, or
284660	288180	any other story that matters to them that the author or, when they're dead, their
288180	289420	company disagrees with.
