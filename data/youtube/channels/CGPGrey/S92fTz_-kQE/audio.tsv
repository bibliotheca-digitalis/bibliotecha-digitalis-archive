0	3640	Can Texas secede from the Union?
3640	7220	America's second most populated and second largest state is always the first to remind
7220	11320	you that it was once an independent nation, the Republic of Texas.
11320	15520	Unlike California's three-week, almost accidental flirt with independence and a hideous flag,
15520	19740	the Republic of Texas was a real country with its own presidents and laws and currency,
19740	25760	for a decade from 1836 until 1846 when it joined the Union to become the 28th state,
25760	29200	thankfully evening out the number of stars.
29200	33280	This happy marriage led pretty much immediately to the Mexican-American war over the question
33280	35520	of how big Texas was.
35520	38000	America as the victor got to decide the answer.
38000	39000	Very big.
39000	42880	While Texas gave up its complete independence to join the Union, it didn't give up its independent
42880	47740	streak and filed for divorce along with several other states a scant 15 years later.
47740	52020	This domestic dispute was settled not with flowers, but with force, something that many
52020	54180	are still grumbly about today.
54180	58200	But history aside, in modern times could Texas still be a real country?
58200	61240	In other words, could Texas succeed if it succeeds?
61240	65260	In terms of population, an independent Texas would be the world's 46th largest country
65260	67520	with 26 million citizens.
67520	70980	And those citizens would make Texas the 13th largest economy.
70980	75600	So the new Texas Republic would be comparable to Australia, except in the size department.
75600	78080	But what about the federal money that goes to Texas?
78080	80520	Those interstate highways don't build themselves, you know.
80520	83600	For a majority of states, independence would be a financial problem.
83600	88160	Mississippi, for example, gets $2 from Washington for every one it sends in taxes.
88160	92360	So an independent magnolia republic would be bankrupt almost instantly.
92360	96640	But not Texas, which gives more money to the federal government in taxes than it gets back.
96640	100640	There's no reason why an independent Texas couldn't keep those highways paved and give
100640	103920	its citizens a small happy Texapendence Day tax cut.
103920	107400	So from a financial perspective, the new Texas Republic gets a check.
107400	110340	Now the question is, can Texas legally secede?
110340	113160	And the answer is no, not at all.
113160	116860	Despite popular belief, even by politicians who should know better, the Texas Constitution
116860	121180	does not include a get-out-of-the-union-free clause, no matter how much Texans, or citizens
121180	122940	of other states, wish that it did.
122940	126580	However, the Texas Constitution does have a weird clause that allows it to divide itself
126580	129220	into five states without the approval of Congress.
129220	133860	So Texas could, at any moment, explode into states perhaps named North Texas, South Texas,
133860	136180	East Texas, West Texas, and Austin.
136180	140500	Which would quintuple its power in the Senate, but not necessarily help it gain independence
140500	143940	because there's no legal process for a state to exit the Union.
143940	147540	Though the Constitution is mute on the issue, secession has come before the Supreme Court
147540	152180	and, shockingly, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that states can't leave
152180	153340	the United States.
153340	155820	But the legal question is weirdly sort of moot.
155820	159320	After all, the first Texas Republic didn't pop into existence out of nowhere.
159320	163880	Texas was originally a state of Mexico, which didn't allow Texas to leave, but leave Texas
163880	167340	did anyway, though under less-than-harmonious circumstances.
167340	171540	While it's hard to imagine a war between the new Texas Republic and the United States,
171540	174500	it isn't hard to imagine who would win that fight.
174500	179980	Texas does have its own military, but seriously, nobody beats America in the war business.
179980	184100	So the only way Texas is leaving is if it can convince the United States to change its
184100	188740	laws to let it leave, which only has a chance of being discussed seriously if a majority
188740	193100	of Texans want independence, which isn't remotely the case.
193100	197260	So while a new Texas Republic is interesting to think about, particularly for some non-Texans,
197260	200380	as of now, it's a long way from becoming reality.
