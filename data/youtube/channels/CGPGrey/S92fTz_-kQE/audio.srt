1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Can Texas secede from the Union?

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,220
America's second most populated and second largest state is always the first to remind

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,320
you that it was once an independent nation, the Republic of Texas.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,520
Unlike California's three-week, almost accidental flirt with independence and a hideous flag,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,740
the Republic of Texas was a real country with its own presidents and laws and currency,

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,760
for a decade from 1836 until 1846 when it joined the Union to become the 28th state,

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,200
thankfully evening out the number of stars.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,280
This happy marriage led pretty much immediately to the Mexican-American war over the question

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,520
of how big Texas was.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,000
America as the victor got to decide the answer.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Very big.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,880
While Texas gave up its complete independence to join the Union, it didn't give up its independent

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,740
streak and filed for divorce along with several other states a scant 15 years later.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,020
This domestic dispute was settled not with flowers, but with force, something that many

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,180
are still grumbly about today.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,200
But history aside, in modern times could Texas still be a real country?

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,240
In other words, could Texas succeed if it succeeds?

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,260
In terms of population, an independent Texas would be the world's 46th largest country

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,520
with 26 million citizens.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,980
And those citizens would make Texas the 13th largest economy.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,600
So the new Texas Republic would be comparable to Australia, except in the size department.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
But what about the federal money that goes to Texas?

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,520
Those interstate highways don't build themselves, you know.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,600
For a majority of states, independence would be a financial problem.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Mississippi, for example, gets $2 from Washington for every one it sends in taxes.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,360
So an independent magnolia republic would be bankrupt almost instantly.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,640
But not Texas, which gives more money to the federal government in taxes than it gets back.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
There's no reason why an independent Texas couldn't keep those highways paved and give

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
its citizens a small happy Texapendence Day tax cut.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,400
So from a financial perspective, the new Texas Republic gets a check.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,340
Now the question is, can Texas legally secede?

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,160
And the answer is no, not at all.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,860
Despite popular belief, even by politicians who should know better, the Texas Constitution

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,180
does not include a get-out-of-the-union-free clause, no matter how much Texans, or citizens

35
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,940
of other states, wish that it did.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,580
However, the Texas Constitution does have a weird clause that allows it to divide itself

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,220
into five states without the approval of Congress.

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,860
So Texas could, at any moment, explode into states perhaps named North Texas, South Texas,

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,180
East Texas, West Texas, and Austin.

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,500
Which would quintuple its power in the Senate, but not necessarily help it gain independence

41
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,940
because there's no legal process for a state to exit the Union.

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,540
Though the Constitution is mute on the issue, secession has come before the Supreme Court

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,180
and, shockingly, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that states can't leave

44
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,340
the United States.

45
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,820
But the legal question is weirdly sort of moot.

46
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,320
After all, the first Texas Republic didn't pop into existence out of nowhere.

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,880
Texas was originally a state of Mexico, which didn't allow Texas to leave, but leave Texas

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,340
did anyway, though under less-than-harmonious circumstances.

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,540
While it's hard to imagine a war between the new Texas Republic and the United States,

50
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,500
it isn't hard to imagine who would win that fight.

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,980
Texas does have its own military, but seriously, nobody beats America in the war business.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,100
So the only way Texas is leaving is if it can convince the United States to change its

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,740
laws to let it leave, which only has a chance of being discussed seriously if a majority

54
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,100
of Texans want independence, which isn't remotely the case.

55
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,260
So while a new Texas Republic is interesting to think about, particularly for some non-Texans,

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,380
as of now, it's a long way from becoming reality.
