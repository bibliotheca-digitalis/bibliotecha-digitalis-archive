00:00.000 --> 00:03.640
Can Texas secede from the Union?

00:03.640 --> 00:07.220
America's second most populated and second largest state is always the first to remind

00:07.220 --> 00:11.320
you that it was once an independent nation, the Republic of Texas.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.520
Unlike California's three-week, almost accidental flirt with independence and a hideous flag,

00:15.520 --> 00:19.740
the Republic of Texas was a real country with its own presidents and laws and currency,

00:19.740 --> 00:25.760
for a decade from 1836 until 1846 when it joined the Union to become the 28th state,

00:25.760 --> 00:29.200
thankfully evening out the number of stars.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.280
This happy marriage led pretty much immediately to the Mexican-American war over the question

00:33.280 --> 00:35.520
of how big Texas was.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.000
America as the victor got to decide the answer.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Very big.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.880
While Texas gave up its complete independence to join the Union, it didn't give up its independent

00:42.880 --> 00:47.740
streak and filed for divorce along with several other states a scant 15 years later.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.020
This domestic dispute was settled not with flowers, but with force, something that many

00:52.020 --> 00:54.180
are still grumbly about today.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.200
But history aside, in modern times could Texas still be a real country?

00:58.200 --> 01:01.240
In other words, could Texas succeed if it succeeds?

01:01.240 --> 01:05.260
In terms of population, an independent Texas would be the world's 46th largest country

01:05.260 --> 01:07.520
with 26 million citizens.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.980
And those citizens would make Texas the 13th largest economy.

01:10.980 --> 01:15.600
So the new Texas Republic would be comparable to Australia, except in the size department.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.080
But what about the federal money that goes to Texas?

01:18.080 --> 01:20.520
Those interstate highways don't build themselves, you know.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.600
For a majority of states, independence would be a financial problem.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.160
Mississippi, for example, gets $2 from Washington for every one it sends in taxes.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.360
So an independent magnolia republic would be bankrupt almost instantly.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.640
But not Texas, which gives more money to the federal government in taxes than it gets back.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.640
There's no reason why an independent Texas couldn't keep those highways paved and give

01:40.640 --> 01:43.920
its citizens a small happy Texapendence Day tax cut.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.400
So from a financial perspective, the new Texas Republic gets a check.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.340
Now the question is, can Texas legally secede?

01:50.340 --> 01:53.160
And the answer is no, not at all.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.860
Despite popular belief, even by politicians who should know better, the Texas Constitution

01:56.860 --> 02:01.180
does not include a get-out-of-the-union-free clause, no matter how much Texans, or citizens

02:01.180 --> 02:02.940
of other states, wish that it did.

02:02.940 --> 02:06.580
However, the Texas Constitution does have a weird clause that allows it to divide itself

02:06.580 --> 02:09.220
into five states without the approval of Congress.

02:09.220 --> 02:13.860
So Texas could, at any moment, explode into states perhaps named North Texas, South Texas,

02:13.860 --> 02:16.180
East Texas, West Texas, and Austin.

02:16.180 --> 02:20.500
Which would quintuple its power in the Senate, but not necessarily help it gain independence

02:20.500 --> 02:23.940
because there's no legal process for a state to exit the Union.

02:23.940 --> 02:27.540
Though the Constitution is mute on the issue, secession has come before the Supreme Court

02:27.540 --> 02:32.180
and, shockingly, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that states can't leave

02:32.180 --> 02:33.340
the United States.

02:33.340 --> 02:35.820
But the legal question is weirdly sort of moot.

02:35.820 --> 02:39.320
After all, the first Texas Republic didn't pop into existence out of nowhere.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.880
Texas was originally a state of Mexico, which didn't allow Texas to leave, but leave Texas

02:43.880 --> 02:47.340
did anyway, though under less-than-harmonious circumstances.

02:47.340 --> 02:51.540
While it's hard to imagine a war between the new Texas Republic and the United States,

02:51.540 --> 02:54.500
it isn't hard to imagine who would win that fight.

02:54.500 --> 02:59.980
Texas does have its own military, but seriously, nobody beats America in the war business.

02:59.980 --> 03:04.100
So the only way Texas is leaving is if it can convince the United States to change its

03:04.100 --> 03:08.740
laws to let it leave, which only has a chance of being discussed seriously if a majority

03:08.740 --> 03:13.100
of Texans want independence, which isn't remotely the case.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.260
So while a new Texas Republic is interesting to think about, particularly for some non-Texans,

03:17.260 --> 03:20.380
as of now, it's a long way from becoming reality.
