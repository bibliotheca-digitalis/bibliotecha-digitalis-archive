1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
When the president dies, who becomes the president?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,260
Well, the Constitution says what happens next is the vice president assumes the powers and duties of the office.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,520
Simple enough, but one backup president is none backup president.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,120
So what happens next next?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,520
The Constitution left this question as homework for the new Congress.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,120
Important homework, yes.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,400
Due date, no.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
So Congress sort of worked on succession with inconsistent and conflicting drafts,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,800
but mostly procrastinated on properly finishing for 200 years,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
finally turning in the 25th Amendment.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,720
Better late than never, though in the meantime, a president had died in office

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,920
not once, not twice, not thrice, not quadrice, not quintice, not hexice, nor septice, but octagonal ice.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,200
Four natural causes, four assassinations.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,360
It was Garfield and McKinley.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,760
This survival record was only 80%, and even counting to today,

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,320
the president is technically the most deadly job in America.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,000
But the odds are, when you become president, you must roll the celestial 2d6,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,520
and if you roll a 7, you die in office.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,240
Woof, don't spend a lot of time in Vegas with those odds.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,400
So the veep becomes the peep and picks a new veep

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,880
who must be confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,120
If this happens quickly, then hunky-dory, everything is reset.

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,600
But getting a VP nominee approved might take some time,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,440
during which the former VP, who is now the president, who is not immortal,

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,840
must cast the dice and could roll a 7.

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,040
The office of the vice president has been vacant

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,240
for more than a baker's dozen of times in United States history,

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,960
which, given the historical state of Congress's homework at the time,

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,080
put the peaceful transfer of power in a precarious position.

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,480
For example, the first time a president died in office,

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,800
the 9th, by the way, didn't even make it to double digits,

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,520
no one knew what should happen.

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
The then-VP just grabbed a judge to administer the oath of the presidency

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,200
to become number 10, and spent the rest of his term

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,680
arguing with Congress and the nation about if he was really the president president,

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,280
or the acting president.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,000
Which seems a little, who cares, what's the difference?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,280
But there is the office of the president,

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
and there are the powers and duties of the office,

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,120
which are not quite the same thing.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,480
See, it's not just death that can remove a president.

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,240
A president can resign, a president can be impeached,

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,720
and a president can be enabled to discharge the powers and duties of the office.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,080
This last enable is from the Constitution,

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,160
which makes no attempt to define what enable means.

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,040
A president can volunteer themselves to be enabled,

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
for example, during physical illness,

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
upon which they don't leave the office,

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
but the VP gets the powers and duties of the office

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,520
and becomes acting president.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,880
This, on a tiny scale, has happened a few times

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,640
when the president has undergone non-trivial surgery.

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,600
A reason for this being to ensure nuclear weapons command and control is maintained at all times.

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,760
So don't get any ideas.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,520
But also, you don't get any ideas.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm still the president.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Power reverts as soon as this is over.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,720
And it will, assuming death doesn't make a bedside visit.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,840
Anyway, inability is a subjective sliding scale.

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,120
A president could be perceived as mentally enabled, by some,

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,680
or become so mentally enabled as to be unable to declare themselves enabled.

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Or become physically enabled, yet simply refuse to declare it.

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,440
Here, the 25th Amendment allows for the vice president to perform a kind of gentle coup.

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay, the president has 15 top-level advisors we will get to later.

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,280
If the VP can get a majority of advisors to state in writing the president is enabled,

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,040
the VP gets the powers and duties of the office.

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,320
The president can challenge this,

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,720
getting a moment to try and consolidate keys to power,

69
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,720
but if the VP and advisors reaffirm the president is indeed enabled,

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,400
the VP is acting president and a 21-day countdown clock begins.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,600
What happens next is up to Congress.

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,640
If they do nothing, when the clock runs out, presidential power returns to the president.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,280
But if within the 21 days, Congress votes with a two-thirds majority that the president is enabled,

74
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,240
then the vice president is permanently acting president.

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,200
And the president is still around?

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,120
Awkward.

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,400
Obviously, this would be a real delicate maneuver for any VP to pull off,

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,160
particularly as the president can dismiss their advisors for any reason,

79
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,840
as long as the president holds the powers and duties of the office.

80
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,160
So getting advisors on board would be... challenging.

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,400
Case in point, in 1919, the president suffered a stroke and was mostly blinded and partly paralyzed.

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,320
Don't worry, no big deal, the president just doesn't want to talk to the public

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,960
or meet with his VP or consult with his advisors or leave the White House at all for a year and a half.

84
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,520
And during this time, there was no move by the VP to declare the president enabled.

85
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,080
But there might be a way around the VP.

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,160
The 25th has this line about Congress appointing, like, its own committee to determine the president enabled.

87
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,880
But the way it's worded is a little unclear.

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,280
Does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee determine inability?

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Or does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee?

90
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,680
If the latter interpretation, that means Congress alone has the power to appoint a committee

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,720
with the power to remove the power of the president, unilaterally.

92
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,920
But as always, with unclear interpretations, were they to happen for realsies,

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
someone might want to weigh in on it.

94
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,520
So those are the four or five ways a president can get removed from office.

95
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,680
But one of them is clearly the most popular,

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,600
so let's talk about what the finished congressional homework says about succession.

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,120
First, the doubt that began with President 10 is dispelled by the 25th,

98
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,880
when the president dies, the vice president becomes the president president.

99
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,240
In able equals VP acting president, dead equals VP president president.

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,720
But if both the president and the vice roll sevens, the order of succession is set.

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,200
And first up is the speaker, who is the elected leader from within the House of Representatives.

102
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,840
And next is the president pro tempore of the Senate, who is the longest serving senator.

103
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
Not automatically, but elected by tradition.

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,960
Gee, that's a funny thing to mention now. I'm sure it won't matter later.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
Senators tend to serve for a long time,

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,320
so the president pro tempore is often in their 80s, with the record holder being 98.

107
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,360
Just worth noting, it was up to Congress to set succession order,

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,800
and Congress just so happened to pick the two most powerful members of Congress as next in line from the VP.

109
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,240
After Congress, succession moves to the cabinet.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,320
These are the advisors mentioned before.

111
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,000
Each here has the title of secretary and our secretary of a same name department.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,960
Explaining each in detail would take too long,

113
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,080
because it would be to explain the entire structure of the executive branch, which is enormous.

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,960
And some of their names give you the idea, but some of them don't.

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,920
For example, number four in line, the secretary of state, who runs the department of state,

116
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,200
which has nothing to do with the states, but everything outside the states.

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
The secretary of state is first in the cabinet,

118
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,440
because managing the foreign relations of the federal government is a pretty big deal

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,280
that requires you to be on at least decent speaking terms with other countries.

120
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,680
A good thing should say you need their support during a sudden transition of power.

121
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,960
The secretary of state is first among the founding four appointed by the first president.

122
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,840
The others, secretary of treasury, secretary of war, and secretary of justice.

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,080
Oh wait, fancy pants here wants to be called the attorney general,

124
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,400
but just so happens to be in charge of the department of justice.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,440
So the oldest departments have their secretaries in 4567 order of succession.

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,720
Now from here, Congress decided the rest should continue on seniority.

127
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,080
Not for people, but departments.

128
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Which has led to an interesting order.

129
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,080
The secretary of the interior is next up, because in the 1800s,

130
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,080
young America realized she had a lot of interior land to manage,

131
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,840
and created the department of the interior to manage the land,

132
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,080
and the Indians on the land.

133
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,680
No, there's no time.

134
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,040
And land needs to be farmed and managed, so the department of agriculture.

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,920
And then in 1900s part one, America wanted to develop commerce and labor,

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,200
and part two, health and human services, and housing and urban development,

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
and oh right, transportation between those urban developments.

138
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,080
Oh, and energy for those developments, and overseeing nuclear weapons.

139
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,960
There really isn't time.

140
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,000
And education.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Meanwhile, that department of war, renamed Department of Defense,

142
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,080
created veterans, and so also the Department of Veterans Affairs.

143
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,840
All done until 2001, Department of Homeland Security.

144
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,600
So the order is more historical happenstance order,

145
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,360
not legislators sat down and thought it through order.

146
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,840
Not to cast shade on the secretary of education,

147
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,120
but if something has happened where the first 15 backups are out of order,

148
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
that sounds a lot like a Homeland Security issue.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
In addition to the debatable order,

150
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,040
for everyone below VP, if their spot in succession comes up,

151
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,120
they are required to resign their current position to become,

152
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
wait for it,

153
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
acting president,

154
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,240
most likely serving the rest of the president's term.

155
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,400
Why? Most likely?

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
Well, one of Congress's homework attempts raises an issue called

157
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,040
bumping with this paragraph,

158
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,240
saying the acting president serves the rest of the term

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,920
unless a prior entitled individual is able to.

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,440
Ugh, it's another interpretation problem.

161
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,600
This does, or doesn't mean,

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
new appointees take priority

163
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,760
and bump those lower on the list out of the office instantly.

164
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Here's the worst case interpretation and scenario.

165
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,400
Imagine while Congress is on recess,

166
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,560
the president, VP, both leaders of Congress, and the secretary of state all roll sevens.

167
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,960
The secretary of treasury becomes acting president

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,040
and appoints a new secretary of state,

169
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,600
who is higher on the list,

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
bumping the acting treasurer president off,

171
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,200
who is now unemployed,

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
at least until reconfirmed.

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,440
And of course, a new secretary of state is needed posthaste, confirmed.

174
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,480
Back from recess, the Senate elects a new president pro tempore,

175
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
who is higher on the list,

176
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,000
and then must resign to become acting president,

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
bumping the current acting president,

178
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
who was the secretary of state,

179
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,400
but is now just unemployed.

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,800
And then the House elects their new speaker,

181
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
bump again.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,760
While there is debate about bumping constitutionality,

183
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
the point is, it's still president 10 all over again.

184
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Uncertainty is the whole problem.

185
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,000
After a government decapitation,

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,400
just the potential of rapid-fire changes in power

187
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,600
is exactly what you don't want to be even debatable

188
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,720
when nuclear command and control is on the table

189
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,680
in what would obviously be trying times.

190
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,880
So maybe a couple more revisions on that homework are due?

191
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,240
But whatever. This is the current order.

192
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,000
And since the 1950s, for no particular reason,

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,920
it's been policy to never let all of these people in a room together at once.

194
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,040
So when you're watching the next State of the Union address,

195
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,560
if you want something to occupy your mind during all the clapping,

196
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,840
you can play Guess Who's the Designated Survivor,

197
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,040
knocking down successors as you spot them to figure out

198
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
who isn't there,

199
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,440
secreted away in a secure location to be the final backup.
