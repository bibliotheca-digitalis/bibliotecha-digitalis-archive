0	2600	When the president dies, who becomes the president?
2600	8260	Well, the Constitution says what happens next is the vice president assumes the powers and duties of the office.
8260	11520	Simple enough, but one backup president is none backup president.
11520	13120	So what happens next next?
13120	16520	The Constitution left this question as homework for the new Congress.
16520	18120	Important homework, yes.
18120	19400	Due date, no.
19400	24360	So Congress sort of worked on succession with inconsistent and conflicting drafts,
24360	28800	but mostly procrastinated on properly finishing for 200 years,
28800	31200	finally turning in the 25th Amendment.
31200	34720	Better late than never, though in the meantime, a president had died in office
34720	39920	not once, not twice, not thrice, not quadrice, not quintice, not hexice, nor septice, but octagonal ice.
39920	42200	Four natural causes, four assassinations.
42200	43360	It was Garfield and McKinley.
43360	47760	This survival record was only 80%, and even counting to today,
47760	51320	the president is technically the most deadly job in America.
51320	56000	But the odds are, when you become president, you must roll the celestial 2d6,
56000	58520	and if you roll a 7, you die in office.
58560	61240	Woof, don't spend a lot of time in Vegas with those odds.
61240	63400	So the veep becomes the peep and picks a new veep
63400	66880	who must be confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.
66880	70120	If this happens quickly, then hunky-dory, everything is reset.
70120	73600	But getting a VP nominee approved might take some time,
73600	77440	during which the former VP, who is now the president, who is not immortal,
77440	79840	must cast the dice and could roll a 7.
79840	82040	The office of the vice president has been vacant
82040	85240	for more than a baker's dozen of times in United States history,
85240	87960	which, given the historical state of Congress's homework at the time,
87960	91080	put the peaceful transfer of power in a precarious position.
91080	93480	For example, the first time a president died in office,
93480	95800	the 9th, by the way, didn't even make it to double digits,
95800	97520	no one knew what should happen.
97520	101360	The then-VP just grabbed a judge to administer the oath of the presidency
101360	104200	to become number 10, and spent the rest of his term
104200	108680	arguing with Congress and the nation about if he was really the president president,
108680	110280	or the acting president.
110280	113000	Which seems a little, who cares, what's the difference?
113000	115280	But there is the office of the president,
115280	117920	and there are the powers and duties of the office,
117920	120120	which are not quite the same thing.
120120	122480	See, it's not just death that can remove a president.
122480	125240	A president can resign, a president can be impeached,
125240	129720	and a president can be enabled to discharge the powers and duties of the office.
129720	132080	This last enable is from the Constitution,
132080	135160	which makes no attempt to define what enable means.
135160	138040	A president can volunteer themselves to be enabled,
138040	139640	for example, during physical illness,
139640	141640	upon which they don't leave the office,
141640	144640	but the VP gets the powers and duties of the office
144640	146520	and becomes acting president.
146520	148880	This, on a tiny scale, has happened a few times
148880	151640	when the president has undergone non-trivial surgery.
151640	156600	A reason for this being to ensure nuclear weapons command and control is maintained at all times.
156600	157760	So don't get any ideas.
157760	159520	But also, you don't get any ideas.
159520	160800	I'm still the president.
160800	162800	Power reverts as soon as this is over.
162800	165720	And it will, assuming death doesn't make a bedside visit.
165720	168840	Anyway, inability is a subjective sliding scale.
168840	172120	A president could be perceived as mentally enabled, by some,
172120	176680	or become so mentally enabled as to be unable to declare themselves enabled.
176680	180280	Or become physically enabled, yet simply refuse to declare it.
180280	185440	Here, the 25th Amendment allows for the vice president to perform a kind of gentle coup.
185440	189040	Okay, the president has 15 top-level advisors we will get to later.
189040	193280	If the VP can get a majority of advisors to state in writing the president is enabled,
193280	196040	the VP gets the powers and duties of the office.
196040	197320	The president can challenge this,
197320	199720	getting a moment to try and consolidate keys to power,
199720	203720	but if the VP and advisors reaffirm the president is indeed enabled,
203720	208400	the VP is acting president and a 21-day countdown clock begins.
208400	210600	What happens next is up to Congress.
210600	214640	If they do nothing, when the clock runs out, presidential power returns to the president.
214640	220280	But if within the 21 days, Congress votes with a two-thirds majority that the president is enabled,
220280	223240	then the vice president is permanently acting president.
223240	226200	And the president is still around?
226200	227120	Awkward.
227120	231400	Obviously, this would be a real delicate maneuver for any VP to pull off,
231400	235160	particularly as the president can dismiss their advisors for any reason,
235160	238840	as long as the president holds the powers and duties of the office.
238840	242160	So getting advisors on board would be... challenging.
242160	247400	Case in point, in 1919, the president suffered a stroke and was mostly blinded and partly paralyzed.
247400	251320	Don't worry, no big deal, the president just doesn't want to talk to the public
251320	256960	or meet with his VP or consult with his advisors or leave the White House at all for a year and a half.
256960	261520	And during this time, there was no move by the VP to declare the president enabled.
261520	264080	But there might be a way around the VP.
264080	270160	The 25th has this line about Congress appointing, like, its own committee to determine the president enabled.
270160	272880	But the way it's worded is a little unclear.
272880	278280	Does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee determine inability?
278280	282480	Or does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee?
282480	287680	If the latter interpretation, that means Congress alone has the power to appoint a committee
287680	291720	with the power to remove the power of the president, unilaterally.
291720	295920	But as always, with unclear interpretations, were they to happen for realsies,
295920	297680	someone might want to weigh in on it.
297680	302520	So those are the four or five ways a president can get removed from office.
302520	304680	But one of them is clearly the most popular,
304680	308600	so let's talk about what the finished congressional homework says about succession.
308600	312120	First, the doubt that began with President 10 is dispelled by the 25th,
312120	315880	when the president dies, the vice president becomes the president president.
315880	321240	In able equals VP acting president, dead equals VP president president.
321240	325720	But if both the president and the vice roll sevens, the order of succession is set.
325720	330200	And first up is the speaker, who is the elected leader from within the House of Representatives.
330200	334840	And next is the president pro tempore of the Senate, who is the longest serving senator.
334840	337520	Not automatically, but elected by tradition.
337520	339960	Gee, that's a funny thing to mention now. I'm sure it won't matter later.
340000	342080	Senators tend to serve for a long time,
342080	347320	so the president pro tempore is often in their 80s, with the record holder being 98.
347320	350360	Just worth noting, it was up to Congress to set succession order,
350360	355800	and Congress just so happened to pick the two most powerful members of Congress as next in line from the VP.
355800	358240	After Congress, succession moves to the cabinet.
358240	360320	These are the advisors mentioned before.
360320	365000	Each here has the title of secretary and our secretary of a same name department.
365000	366960	Explaining each in detail would take too long,
366960	372080	because it would be to explain the entire structure of the executive branch, which is enormous.
372080	374960	And some of their names give you the idea, but some of them don't.
374960	378920	For example, number four in line, the secretary of state, who runs the department of state,
378920	382200	which has nothing to do with the states, but everything outside the states.
382200	384280	The secretary of state is first in the cabinet,
384280	387440	because managing the foreign relations of the federal government is a pretty big deal
387440	391280	that requires you to be on at least decent speaking terms with other countries.
391280	395680	A good thing should say you need their support during a sudden transition of power.
395680	399960	The secretary of state is first among the founding four appointed by the first president.
399960	403840	The others, secretary of treasury, secretary of war, and secretary of justice.
403840	407080	Oh wait, fancy pants here wants to be called the attorney general,
407080	410400	but just so happens to be in charge of the department of justice.
410400	414440	So the oldest departments have their secretaries in 4567 order of succession.
414440	417720	Now from here, Congress decided the rest should continue on seniority.
417720	420080	Not for people, but departments.
420080	422080	Which has led to an interesting order.
422080	425080	The secretary of the interior is next up, because in the 1800s,
425080	428080	young America realized she had a lot of interior land to manage,
428080	430840	and created the department of the interior to manage the land,
430840	432080	and the Indians on the land.
432080	432680	No, there's no time.
432680	436040	And land needs to be farmed and managed, so the department of agriculture.
436040	439920	And then in 1900s part one, America wanted to develop commerce and labor,
439920	443200	and part two, health and human services, and housing and urban development,
443200	445800	and oh right, transportation between those urban developments.
445800	449080	Oh, and energy for those developments, and overseeing nuclear weapons.
449080	449960	There really isn't time.
449960	451000	And education.
451000	453760	Meanwhile, that department of war, renamed Department of Defense,
453760	457080	created veterans, and so also the Department of Veterans Affairs.
457080	461840	All done until 2001, Department of Homeland Security.
461840	464600	So the order is more historical happenstance order,
464600	467360	not legislators sat down and thought it through order.
467360	469840	Not to cast shade on the secretary of education,
469840	475120	but if something has happened where the first 15 backups are out of order,
475120	478000	that sounds a lot like a Homeland Security issue.
478000	479920	In addition to the debatable order,
479920	483040	for everyone below VP, if their spot in succession comes up,
483040	486120	they are required to resign their current position to become,
486120	487160	wait for it,
487160	488440	acting president,
488440	491240	most likely serving the rest of the president's term.
491240	492400	Why? Most likely?
492400	495440	Well, one of Congress's homework attempts raises an issue called
495440	497040	bumping with this paragraph,
497040	500240	saying the acting president serves the rest of the term
500240	503920	unless a prior entitled individual is able to.
503920	506440	Ugh, it's another interpretation problem.
506440	508600	This does, or doesn't mean,
508600	510640	new appointees take priority
510640	514760	and bump those lower on the list out of the office instantly.
514760	517440	Here's the worst case interpretation and scenario.
517440	519400	Imagine while Congress is on recess,
519400	523560	the president, VP, both leaders of Congress, and the secretary of state all roll sevens.
523560	525960	The secretary of treasury becomes acting president
525960	528040	and appoints a new secretary of state,
528040	529600	who is higher on the list,
529600	531760	bumping the acting treasurer president off,
531760	533200	who is now unemployed,
533200	534720	at least until reconfirmed.
534720	538440	And of course, a new secretary of state is needed posthaste, confirmed.
538440	541480	Back from recess, the Senate elects a new president pro tempore,
541480	543160	who is higher on the list,
543160	546000	and then must resign to become acting president,
546000	547720	bumping the current acting president,
547720	549720	who was the secretary of state,
549720	551400	but is now just unemployed.
551400	553800	And then the House elects their new speaker,
553800	555000	bump again.
555000	557760	While there is debate about bumping constitutionality,
557760	561440	the point is, it's still president 10 all over again.
561440	563880	Uncertainty is the whole problem.
563880	566000	After a government decapitation,
566000	569400	just the potential of rapid-fire changes in power
569400	572600	is exactly what you don't want to be even debatable
572600	575720	when nuclear command and control is on the table
575720	578680	in what would obviously be trying times.
578680	581880	So maybe a couple more revisions on that homework are due?
581880	584240	But whatever. This is the current order.
584240	587000	And since the 1950s, for no particular reason,
587000	590920	it's been policy to never let all of these people in a room together at once.
590920	593040	So when you're watching the next State of the Union address,
593080	596560	if you want something to occupy your mind during all the clapping,
596560	599840	you can play Guess Who's the Designated Survivor,
599840	603040	knocking down successors as you spot them to figure out
603040	604240	who isn't there,
604240	608440	secreted away in a secure location to be the final backup.
