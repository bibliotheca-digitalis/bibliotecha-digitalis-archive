00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
When the president dies, who becomes the president?

00:02.600 --> 00:08.260
Well, the Constitution says what happens next is the vice president assumes the powers and duties of the office.

00:08.260 --> 00:11.520
Simple enough, but one backup president is none backup president.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.120
So what happens next next?

00:13.120 --> 00:16.520
The Constitution left this question as homework for the new Congress.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.120
Important homework, yes.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.400
Due date, no.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.360
So Congress sort of worked on succession with inconsistent and conflicting drafts,

00:24.360 --> 00:28.800
but mostly procrastinated on properly finishing for 200 years,

00:28.800 --> 00:31.200
finally turning in the 25th Amendment.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.720
Better late than never, though in the meantime, a president had died in office

00:34.720 --> 00:39.920
not once, not twice, not thrice, not quadrice, not quintice, not hexice, nor septice, but octagonal ice.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.200
Four natural causes, four assassinations.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.360
It was Garfield and McKinley.

00:43.360 --> 00:47.760
This survival record was only 80%, and even counting to today,

00:47.760 --> 00:51.320
the president is technically the most deadly job in America.

00:51.320 --> 00:56.000
But the odds are, when you become president, you must roll the celestial 2d6,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.520
and if you roll a 7, you die in office.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.240
Woof, don't spend a lot of time in Vegas with those odds.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.400
So the veep becomes the peep and picks a new veep

01:03.400 --> 01:06.880
who must be confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.120
If this happens quickly, then hunky-dory, everything is reset.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.600
But getting a VP nominee approved might take some time,

01:13.600 --> 01:17.440
during which the former VP, who is now the president, who is not immortal,

01:17.440 --> 01:19.840
must cast the dice and could roll a 7.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.040
The office of the vice president has been vacant

01:22.040 --> 01:25.240
for more than a baker's dozen of times in United States history,

01:25.240 --> 01:27.960
which, given the historical state of Congress's homework at the time,

01:27.960 --> 01:31.080
put the peaceful transfer of power in a precarious position.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.480
For example, the first time a president died in office,

01:33.480 --> 01:35.800
the 9th, by the way, didn't even make it to double digits,

01:35.800 --> 01:37.520
no one knew what should happen.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.360
The then-VP just grabbed a judge to administer the oath of the presidency

01:41.360 --> 01:44.200
to become number 10, and spent the rest of his term

01:44.200 --> 01:48.680
arguing with Congress and the nation about if he was really the president president,

01:48.680 --> 01:50.280
or the acting president.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.000
Which seems a little, who cares, what's the difference?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.280
But there is the office of the president,

01:55.280 --> 01:57.920
and there are the powers and duties of the office,

01:57.920 --> 02:00.120
which are not quite the same thing.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.480
See, it's not just death that can remove a president.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.240
A president can resign, a president can be impeached,

02:05.240 --> 02:09.720
and a president can be enabled to discharge the powers and duties of the office.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.080
This last enable is from the Constitution,

02:12.080 --> 02:15.160
which makes no attempt to define what enable means.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.040
A president can volunteer themselves to be enabled,

02:18.040 --> 02:19.640
for example, during physical illness,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.640
upon which they don't leave the office,

02:21.640 --> 02:24.640
but the VP gets the powers and duties of the office

02:24.640 --> 02:26.520
and becomes acting president.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.880
This, on a tiny scale, has happened a few times

02:28.880 --> 02:31.640
when the president has undergone non-trivial surgery.

02:31.640 --> 02:36.600
A reason for this being to ensure nuclear weapons command and control is maintained at all times.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.760
So don't get any ideas.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.520
But also, you don't get any ideas.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.800
I'm still the president.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
Power reverts as soon as this is over.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.720
And it will, assuming death doesn't make a bedside visit.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.840
Anyway, inability is a subjective sliding scale.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.120
A president could be perceived as mentally enabled, by some,

02:52.120 --> 02:56.680
or become so mentally enabled as to be unable to declare themselves enabled.

02:56.680 --> 03:00.280
Or become physically enabled, yet simply refuse to declare it.

03:00.280 --> 03:05.440
Here, the 25th Amendment allows for the vice president to perform a kind of gentle coup.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.040
Okay, the president has 15 top-level advisors we will get to later.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.280
If the VP can get a majority of advisors to state in writing the president is enabled,

03:13.280 --> 03:16.040
the VP gets the powers and duties of the office.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.320
The president can challenge this,

03:17.320 --> 03:19.720
getting a moment to try and consolidate keys to power,

03:19.720 --> 03:23.720
but if the VP and advisors reaffirm the president is indeed enabled,

03:23.720 --> 03:28.400
the VP is acting president and a 21-day countdown clock begins.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.600
What happens next is up to Congress.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.640
If they do nothing, when the clock runs out, presidential power returns to the president.

03:34.640 --> 03:40.280
But if within the 21 days, Congress votes with a two-thirds majority that the president is enabled,

03:40.280 --> 03:43.240
then the vice president is permanently acting president.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.200
And the president is still around?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.120
Awkward.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.400
Obviously, this would be a real delicate maneuver for any VP to pull off,

03:51.400 --> 03:55.160
particularly as the president can dismiss their advisors for any reason,

03:55.160 --> 03:58.840
as long as the president holds the powers and duties of the office.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.160
So getting advisors on board would be... challenging.

04:02.160 --> 04:07.400
Case in point, in 1919, the president suffered a stroke and was mostly blinded and partly paralyzed.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.320
Don't worry, no big deal, the president just doesn't want to talk to the public

04:11.320 --> 04:16.960
or meet with his VP or consult with his advisors or leave the White House at all for a year and a half.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.520
And during this time, there was no move by the VP to declare the president enabled.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.080
But there might be a way around the VP.

04:24.080 --> 04:30.160
The 25th has this line about Congress appointing, like, its own committee to determine the president enabled.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.880
But the way it's worded is a little unclear.

04:32.880 --> 04:38.280
Does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee determine inability?

04:38.280 --> 04:42.480
Or does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee?

04:42.480 --> 04:47.680
If the latter interpretation, that means Congress alone has the power to appoint a committee

04:47.680 --> 04:51.720
with the power to remove the power of the president, unilaterally.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.920
But as always, with unclear interpretations, were they to happen for realsies,

04:55.920 --> 04:57.680
someone might want to weigh in on it.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.520
So those are the four or five ways a president can get removed from office.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.680
But one of them is clearly the most popular,

05:04.680 --> 05:08.600
so let's talk about what the finished congressional homework says about succession.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.120
First, the doubt that began with President 10 is dispelled by the 25th,

05:12.120 --> 05:15.880
when the president dies, the vice president becomes the president president.

05:15.880 --> 05:21.240
In able equals VP acting president, dead equals VP president president.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.720
But if both the president and the vice roll sevens, the order of succession is set.

05:25.720 --> 05:30.200
And first up is the speaker, who is the elected leader from within the House of Representatives.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.840
And next is the president pro tempore of the Senate, who is the longest serving senator.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.520
Not automatically, but elected by tradition.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.960
Gee, that's a funny thing to mention now. I'm sure it won't matter later.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.080
Senators tend to serve for a long time,

05:42.080 --> 05:47.320
so the president pro tempore is often in their 80s, with the record holder being 98.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.360
Just worth noting, it was up to Congress to set succession order,

05:50.360 --> 05:55.800
and Congress just so happened to pick the two most powerful members of Congress as next in line from the VP.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.240
After Congress, succession moves to the cabinet.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.320
These are the advisors mentioned before.

06:00.320 --> 06:05.000
Each here has the title of secretary and our secretary of a same name department.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.960
Explaining each in detail would take too long,

06:06.960 --> 06:12.080
because it would be to explain the entire structure of the executive branch, which is enormous.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.960
And some of their names give you the idea, but some of them don't.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.920
For example, number four in line, the secretary of state, who runs the department of state,

06:18.920 --> 06:22.200
which has nothing to do with the states, but everything outside the states.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.280
The secretary of state is first in the cabinet,

06:24.280 --> 06:27.440
because managing the foreign relations of the federal government is a pretty big deal

06:27.440 --> 06:31.280
that requires you to be on at least decent speaking terms with other countries.

06:31.280 --> 06:35.680
A good thing should say you need their support during a sudden transition of power.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.960
The secretary of state is first among the founding four appointed by the first president.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.840
The others, secretary of treasury, secretary of war, and secretary of justice.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.080
Oh wait, fancy pants here wants to be called the attorney general,

06:47.080 --> 06:50.400
but just so happens to be in charge of the department of justice.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.440
So the oldest departments have their secretaries in 4567 order of succession.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.720
Now from here, Congress decided the rest should continue on seniority.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.080
Not for people, but departments.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.080
Which has led to an interesting order.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.080
The secretary of the interior is next up, because in the 1800s,

07:05.080 --> 07:08.080
young America realized she had a lot of interior land to manage,

07:08.080 --> 07:10.840
and created the department of the interior to manage the land,

07:10.840 --> 07:12.080
and the Indians on the land.

07:12.080 --> 07:12.680
No, there's no time.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.040
And land needs to be farmed and managed, so the department of agriculture.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.920
And then in 1900s part one, America wanted to develop commerce and labor,

07:19.920 --> 07:23.200
and part two, health and human services, and housing and urban development,

07:23.200 --> 07:25.800
and oh right, transportation between those urban developments.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.080
Oh, and energy for those developments, and overseeing nuclear weapons.

07:29.080 --> 07:29.960
There really isn't time.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.000
And education.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.760
Meanwhile, that department of war, renamed Department of Defense,

07:33.760 --> 07:37.080
created veterans, and so also the Department of Veterans Affairs.

07:37.080 --> 07:41.840
All done until 2001, Department of Homeland Security.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.600
So the order is more historical happenstance order,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.360
not legislators sat down and thought it through order.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.840
Not to cast shade on the secretary of education,

07:49.840 --> 07:55.120
but if something has happened where the first 15 backups are out of order,

07:55.120 --> 07:58.000
that sounds a lot like a Homeland Security issue.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.920
In addition to the debatable order,

07:59.920 --> 08:03.040
for everyone below VP, if their spot in succession comes up,

08:03.040 --> 08:06.120
they are required to resign their current position to become,

08:06.120 --> 08:07.160
wait for it,

08:07.160 --> 08:08.440
acting president,

08:08.440 --> 08:11.240
most likely serving the rest of the president's term.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.400
Why? Most likely?

08:12.400 --> 08:15.440
Well, one of Congress's homework attempts raises an issue called

08:15.440 --> 08:17.040
bumping with this paragraph,

08:17.040 --> 08:20.240
saying the acting president serves the rest of the term

08:20.240 --> 08:23.920
unless a prior entitled individual is able to.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.440
Ugh, it's another interpretation problem.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.600
This does, or doesn't mean,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.640
new appointees take priority

08:30.640 --> 08:34.760
and bump those lower on the list out of the office instantly.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.440
Here's the worst case interpretation and scenario.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.400
Imagine while Congress is on recess,

08:39.400 --> 08:43.560
the president, VP, both leaders of Congress, and the secretary of state all roll sevens.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.960
The secretary of treasury becomes acting president

08:45.960 --> 08:48.040
and appoints a new secretary of state,

08:48.040 --> 08:49.600
who is higher on the list,

08:49.600 --> 08:51.760
bumping the acting treasurer president off,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.200
who is now unemployed,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.720
at least until reconfirmed.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.440
And of course, a new secretary of state is needed posthaste, confirmed.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.480
Back from recess, the Senate elects a new president pro tempore,

09:01.480 --> 09:03.160
who is higher on the list,

09:03.160 --> 09:06.000
and then must resign to become acting president,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.720
bumping the current acting president,

09:07.720 --> 09:09.720
who was the secretary of state,

09:09.720 --> 09:11.400
but is now just unemployed.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.800
And then the House elects their new speaker,

09:13.800 --> 09:15.000
bump again.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.760
While there is debate about bumping constitutionality,

09:17.760 --> 09:21.440
the point is, it's still president 10 all over again.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.880
Uncertainty is the whole problem.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.000
After a government decapitation,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.400
just the potential of rapid-fire changes in power

09:29.400 --> 09:32.600
is exactly what you don't want to be even debatable

09:32.600 --> 09:35.720
when nuclear command and control is on the table

09:35.720 --> 09:38.680
in what would obviously be trying times.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.880
So maybe a couple more revisions on that homework are due?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.240
But whatever. This is the current order.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.000
And since the 1950s, for no particular reason,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.920
it's been policy to never let all of these people in a room together at once.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.040
So when you're watching the next State of the Union address,

09:53.080 --> 09:56.560
if you want something to occupy your mind during all the clapping,

09:56.560 --> 09:59.840
you can play Guess Who's the Designated Survivor,

09:59.840 --> 10:03.040
knocking down successors as you spot them to figure out

10:03.040 --> 10:04.240
who isn't there,

10:04.240 --> 10:08.440
secreted away in a secure location to be the final backup.
