0	5300	When it comes to neighbors, most countries have several options, like north to Canada or south to Mexico.
5300	8100	But there are countries that don't have this freedom of choice.
8100	11400	Not because they're islands, but because they're trapped in another country.
11400	17000	For example, tiny Vatican City, which fits inside of not just Italy, but also just Rome.
17000	20300	How Vatican City got surrounded is complicated, but not unique,
20300	26200	for there's also the Republic of San Marino, home to 30,000 citizens, which Italy also completely surrounds.
26200	29300	Italy, apparently, is a country that likes countries in its country.
29300	33400	But trapping nations is not just Italy's thing, for there's also Lesotho in South Africa,
33400	37300	which is both the largest encircled country, at 70 times Vatican City's size,
37300	40300	and the most populated with over 2 million citizens.
40300	44900	The thing that makes these three countries' borders bizarre is that any path in or out
44900	47800	must go through the one and only neighbor they have.
47800	51000	But now take a look at the Gambia, which, excluding that tiny ocean border,
51000	53300	is as surrounded as any nation can get.
53300	58400	If we amend the previous rule to every land route, now we've made a category of single-neighbor nations,
58400	64300	which includes all four of these, and countries like Portugal, where the only way in or out is through Spain.
64300	65700	Who else is on this list?
65700	70300	Well, there's Monaco, which must go through France, Qatar through Saudi Arabia, Denmark through Germany,
70300	76000	South Korea through North Korea, though South Korea might as well be an island nation for most practical travel purposes,
76000	79600	East Timor and Papua New Guinea, both through Indonesia, Brunei through Malaysia,
79600	81700	and there are two sets of twins.
81700	87500	There's the Dominican Republic, whose only neighbor is Haiti, and Haiti, whose only neighbor is the Dominican Republic.
87500	92500	And the second set is Ireland through the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom through Ireland.
92500	97100	Side note here, while there are tons of British places around the world, some of which border other nations,
97100	100300	these are not part of the United Kingdom. It's complicated.
100300	106100	Though, if you wanted to, you could argue that the United Kingdom technically dug a land border under the channel to the continent,
106100	109400	presumably to be closer to France, her best friend ever.
109400	115700	Finally, there's one more country in this category. Canada, the largest single-neighbor nation in the world.
117500	125800	Thanks for watching!
