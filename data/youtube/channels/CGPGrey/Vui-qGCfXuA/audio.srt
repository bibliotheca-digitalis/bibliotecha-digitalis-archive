1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
When it comes to neighbors, most countries have several options, like north to Canada or south to Mexico.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,100
But there are countries that don't have this freedom of choice.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,400
Not because they're islands, but because they're trapped in another country.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,000
For example, tiny Vatican City, which fits inside of not just Italy, but also just Rome.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,300
How Vatican City got surrounded is complicated, but not unique,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,200
for there's also the Republic of San Marino, home to 30,000 citizens, which Italy also completely surrounds.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,300
Italy, apparently, is a country that likes countries in its country.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,400
But trapping nations is not just Italy's thing, for there's also Lesotho in South Africa,

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,300
which is both the largest encircled country, at 70 times Vatican City's size,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,300
and the most populated with over 2 million citizens.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,900
The thing that makes these three countries' borders bizarre is that any path in or out

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,800
must go through the one and only neighbor they have.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,000
But now take a look at the Gambia, which, excluding that tiny ocean border,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
is as surrounded as any nation can get.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,400
If we amend the previous rule to every land route, now we've made a category of single-neighbor nations,

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,300
which includes all four of these, and countries like Portugal, where the only way in or out is through Spain.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,700
Who else is on this list?

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,300
Well, there's Monaco, which must go through France, Qatar through Saudi Arabia, Denmark through Germany,

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,000
South Korea through North Korea, though South Korea might as well be an island nation for most practical travel purposes,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
East Timor and Papua New Guinea, both through Indonesia, Brunei through Malaysia,

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,700
and there are two sets of twins.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,500
There's the Dominican Republic, whose only neighbor is Haiti, and Haiti, whose only neighbor is the Dominican Republic.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,500
And the second set is Ireland through the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom through Ireland.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,100
Side note here, while there are tons of British places around the world, some of which border other nations,

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,300
these are not part of the United Kingdom. It's complicated.

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,100
Though, if you wanted to, you could argue that the United Kingdom technically dug a land border under the channel to the continent,

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,400
presumably to be closer to France, her best friend ever.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,700
Finally, there's one more country in this category. Canada, the largest single-neighbor nation in the world.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,800
Thanks for watching!
