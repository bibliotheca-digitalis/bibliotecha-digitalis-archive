00:00.000 --> 00:05.300
When it comes to neighbors, most countries have several options, like north to Canada or south to Mexico.

00:05.300 --> 00:08.100
But there are countries that don't have this freedom of choice.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.400
Not because they're islands, but because they're trapped in another country.

00:11.400 --> 00:17.000
For example, tiny Vatican City, which fits inside of not just Italy, but also just Rome.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.300
How Vatican City got surrounded is complicated, but not unique,

00:20.300 --> 00:26.200
for there's also the Republic of San Marino, home to 30,000 citizens, which Italy also completely surrounds.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.300
Italy, apparently, is a country that likes countries in its country.

00:29.300 --> 00:33.400
But trapping nations is not just Italy's thing, for there's also Lesotho in South Africa,

00:33.400 --> 00:37.300
which is both the largest encircled country, at 70 times Vatican City's size,

00:37.300 --> 00:40.300
and the most populated with over 2 million citizens.

00:40.300 --> 00:44.900
The thing that makes these three countries' borders bizarre is that any path in or out

00:44.900 --> 00:47.800
must go through the one and only neighbor they have.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.000
But now take a look at the Gambia, which, excluding that tiny ocean border,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.300
is as surrounded as any nation can get.

00:53.300 --> 00:58.400
If we amend the previous rule to every land route, now we've made a category of single-neighbor nations,

00:58.400 --> 01:04.300
which includes all four of these, and countries like Portugal, where the only way in or out is through Spain.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.700
Who else is on this list?

01:05.700 --> 01:10.300
Well, there's Monaco, which must go through France, Qatar through Saudi Arabia, Denmark through Germany,

01:10.300 --> 01:16.000
South Korea through North Korea, though South Korea might as well be an island nation for most practical travel purposes,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.600
East Timor and Papua New Guinea, both through Indonesia, Brunei through Malaysia,

01:19.600 --> 01:21.700
and there are two sets of twins.

01:21.700 --> 01:27.500
There's the Dominican Republic, whose only neighbor is Haiti, and Haiti, whose only neighbor is the Dominican Republic.

01:27.500 --> 01:32.500
And the second set is Ireland through the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom through Ireland.

01:32.500 --> 01:37.100
Side note here, while there are tons of British places around the world, some of which border other nations,

01:37.100 --> 01:40.300
these are not part of the United Kingdom. It's complicated.

01:40.300 --> 01:46.100
Though, if you wanted to, you could argue that the United Kingdom technically dug a land border under the channel to the continent,

01:46.100 --> 01:49.400
presumably to be closer to France, her best friend ever.

01:49.400 --> 01:55.700
Finally, there's one more country in this category. Canada, the largest single-neighbor nation in the world.

01:57.500 --> 02:05.800
Thanks for watching!
