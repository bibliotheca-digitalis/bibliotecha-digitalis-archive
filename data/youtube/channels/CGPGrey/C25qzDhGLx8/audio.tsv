0	3000	When do you want to die?
3000	7000	The Reaper is busy, but he can fit you in right now.
7000	9000	Too soon? Later perhaps?
9000	13000	Future you will keep the appointment? Old and with a life fully lived?
13000	16000	Perhaps ever so slightly bored and ready?
16000	20000	Now you might think that, but when the appointment whippersnapper you set comes,
20000	25000	it is not in the future, because you don't live in the future.
25000	30000	You always live in the now, and thus you always die now.
30000	36000	Because the Reaper comes for all eventually, humans have formed a relationship with death perverse.
36000	40000	Like a hostage who grows to love their kidnapper, humans tell themselves
40000	44000	the handful of decades the Reaper gives them is just the right length.
44000	49000	That living a truly long and healthy life would get boring and would be unnatural,
49000	53000	and imagine all the problems if death took a holiday.
53000	57000	And so the Reaper of age whispers that he is your friend.
57000	63000	Always near, growing humans bigger, stronger, healthier, and smarter at first.
63000	66000	Then comes his harvest of slow rot.
66000	70000	Death is a part of life, he whispers. Death gives life meaning.
70000	74000	This is madness. Misery doesn't give happiness meaning.
74000	76000	Happiness is meaning itself.
76000	80000	If you tortured people to make them better appreciate the pleasures of life,
80000	83000	you would be a monster, just like this guy.
83000	88000	No parent would ask the Reaper of age to wrinkle their child's skin, weaken their bones,
88000	92000	dim their vision and their minds, cripple them in a thousand ways over decades
92000	96000	to ultimately kill them, to give their life meaning.
96000	99000	But what can you do? The world contains pain and death,
99000	105000	and so your brain believes the sweet lies that the horrors you can't avoid are good for you.
105000	110000	And while death is a part of life, cholera was a part of life
110000	114000	until humans developed wells and sewers to separate water from waste.
114000	118000	Short-sightedness is a part of life, until it isn't.
118000	122000	Just because a thing is natural doesn't make it good or necessary.
122000	126000	It's natural to live lives nasty, brutish, and short,
126000	132000	and it's natural for humans to look at what indifferent nature provides as the starting point,
132000	134000	as a to-do list.
134000	137000	Where humans focus, technology ever improves,
137000	141000	and with that, the ability to make lives better ever improves.
141000	147000	And just now, some basic tools with real promise to slow or halt the decay
147000	151000	are becoming visible on the horizon, which raises the question,
151000	154000	just how strong is the Reaper of age?
154000	160000	With enough time and attention, can humans craft these basic tools into shields and swords
160000	163000	to keep him at bay, possibly indefinitely?
163000	164000	Perhaps.
164000	170000	And if so, the first immortal generation may be alive today,
170000	175000	a generation that lives a healthy adulthood as long as they wish to.
175000	182000	But to make that happen, brains need to be cleared of the millennia of death acceptance.
182000	186000	Death is not a solution to future problems imagined.
186000	189000	Faced with the changes longer lives will bring,
189000	194000	humans will not miss the Reaper and construct one to solve their problems.
194000	199000	Just as with our larger cities, we don't remix the water to bring back cholera.
199000	205000	Humans must discard the learned helplessness the Reaper and their own brains have imposed on them,
205000	210000	to instead see the rot and decay not as natural and inevitable,
210000	213000	but as a degenerative disease to be attacked like all the others,
213000	218000	as the degenerative disease that affects 100% of the population
218000	221000	and is a source of misery untold.
221000	226000	Misery not in your distant future, but in your now.
226000	229000	And how soon we start the project of focusing our attention
229000	233000	and shaping our tools against the Reaper matters.
233000	241000	For the difference of but a day might determine what side of the future chasm you find yourself on,
241000	246000	journeying forever forward or falling backward into the abyss.
248000	253000	Is it too late for you? We probably won't win the war against death because death is all powerful,
253000	257000	but we might be able to win the battle against the next best thing aging itself.
257000	262000	There's a realistic chance that you might live a longer and healthier life, but should we really do it?
262000	265000	We explore this in our video.
