00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
When do you want to die?

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
The Reaper is busy, but he can fit you in right now.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Too soon? Later perhaps?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Future you will keep the appointment? Old and with a life fully lived?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Perhaps ever so slightly bored and ready?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Now you might think that, but when the appointment whippersnapper you set comes,

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
it is not in the future, because you don't live in the future.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
You always live in the now, and thus you always die now.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Because the Reaper comes for all eventually, humans have formed a relationship with death perverse.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Like a hostage who grows to love their kidnapper, humans tell themselves

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
the handful of decades the Reaper gives them is just the right length.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
That living a truly long and healthy life would get boring and would be unnatural,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
and imagine all the problems if death took a holiday.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
And so the Reaper of age whispers that he is your friend.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Always near, growing humans bigger, stronger, healthier, and smarter at first.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Then comes his harvest of slow rot.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Death is a part of life, he whispers. Death gives life meaning.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
This is madness. Misery doesn't give happiness meaning.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Happiness is meaning itself.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
If you tortured people to make them better appreciate the pleasures of life,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
you would be a monster, just like this guy.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
No parent would ask the Reaper of age to wrinkle their child's skin, weaken their bones,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
dim their vision and their minds, cripple them in a thousand ways over decades

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
to ultimately kill them, to give their life meaning.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
But what can you do? The world contains pain and death,

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
and so your brain believes the sweet lies that the horrors you can't avoid are good for you.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
And while death is a part of life, cholera was a part of life

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
until humans developed wells and sewers to separate water from waste.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Short-sightedness is a part of life, until it isn't.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Just because a thing is natural doesn't make it good or necessary.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
It's natural to live lives nasty, brutish, and short,

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
and it's natural for humans to look at what indifferent nature provides as the starting point,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
as a to-do list.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Where humans focus, technology ever improves,

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
and with that, the ability to make lives better ever improves.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
And just now, some basic tools with real promise to slow or halt the decay

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
are becoming visible on the horizon, which raises the question,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
just how strong is the Reaper of age?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
With enough time and attention, can humans craft these basic tools into shields and swords

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
to keep him at bay, possibly indefinitely?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Perhaps.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
And if so, the first immortal generation may be alive today,

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
a generation that lives a healthy adulthood as long as they wish to.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
But to make that happen, brains need to be cleared of the millennia of death acceptance.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Death is not a solution to future problems imagined.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Faced with the changes longer lives will bring,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
humans will not miss the Reaper and construct one to solve their problems.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Just as with our larger cities, we don't remix the water to bring back cholera.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
Humans must discard the learned helplessness the Reaper and their own brains have imposed on them,

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
to instead see the rot and decay not as natural and inevitable,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
but as a degenerative disease to be attacked like all the others,

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
as the degenerative disease that affects 100% of the population

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
and is a source of misery untold.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Misery not in your distant future, but in your now.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And how soon we start the project of focusing our attention

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
and shaping our tools against the Reaper matters.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
For the difference of but a day might determine what side of the future chasm you find yourself on,

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
journeying forever forward or falling backward into the abyss.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Is it too late for you? We probably won't win the war against death because death is all powerful,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
but we might be able to win the battle against the next best thing aging itself.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
There's a realistic chance that you might live a longer and healthier life, but should we really do it?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
We explore this in our video.
