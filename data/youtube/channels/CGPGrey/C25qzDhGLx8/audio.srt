1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When do you want to die?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The Reaper is busy, but he can fit you in right now.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Too soon? Later perhaps?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Future you will keep the appointment? Old and with a life fully lived?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Perhaps ever so slightly bored and ready?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now you might think that, but when the appointment whippersnapper you set comes,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
it is not in the future, because you don't live in the future.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You always live in the now, and thus you always die now.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because the Reaper comes for all eventually, humans have formed a relationship with death perverse.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Like a hostage who grows to love their kidnapper, humans tell themselves

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the handful of decades the Reaper gives them is just the right length.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That living a truly long and healthy life would get boring and would be unnatural,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and imagine all the problems if death took a holiday.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And so the Reaper of age whispers that he is your friend.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Always near, growing humans bigger, stronger, healthier, and smarter at first.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then comes his harvest of slow rot.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Death is a part of life, he whispers. Death gives life meaning.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is madness. Misery doesn't give happiness meaning.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Happiness is meaning itself.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you tortured people to make them better appreciate the pleasures of life,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you would be a monster, just like this guy.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No parent would ask the Reaper of age to wrinkle their child's skin, weaken their bones,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
dim their vision and their minds, cripple them in a thousand ways over decades

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to ultimately kill them, to give their life meaning.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But what can you do? The world contains pain and death,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and so your brain believes the sweet lies that the horrors you can't avoid are good for you.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And while death is a part of life, cholera was a part of life

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
until humans developed wells and sewers to separate water from waste.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Short-sightedness is a part of life, until it isn't.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just because a thing is natural doesn't make it good or necessary.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's natural to live lives nasty, brutish, and short,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and it's natural for humans to look at what indifferent nature provides as the starting point,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
as a to-do list.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Where humans focus, technology ever improves,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and with that, the ability to make lives better ever improves.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And just now, some basic tools with real promise to slow or halt the decay

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
are becoming visible on the horizon, which raises the question,

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
just how strong is the Reaper of age?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
With enough time and attention, can humans craft these basic tools into shields and swords

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to keep him at bay, possibly indefinitely?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Perhaps.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And if so, the first immortal generation may be alive today,

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
a generation that lives a healthy adulthood as long as they wish to.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But to make that happen, brains need to be cleared of the millennia of death acceptance.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Death is not a solution to future problems imagined.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Faced with the changes longer lives will bring,

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
humans will not miss the Reaper and construct one to solve their problems.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just as with our larger cities, we don't remix the water to bring back cholera.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Humans must discard the learned helplessness the Reaper and their own brains have imposed on them,

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to instead see the rot and decay not as natural and inevitable,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but as a degenerative disease to be attacked like all the others,

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
as the degenerative disease that affects 100% of the population

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and is a source of misery untold.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Misery not in your distant future, but in your now.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And how soon we start the project of focusing our attention

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and shaping our tools against the Reaper matters.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
For the difference of but a day might determine what side of the future chasm you find yourself on,

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
journeying forever forward or falling backward into the abyss.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is it too late for you? We probably won't win the war against death because death is all powerful,

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but we might be able to win the battle against the next best thing aging itself.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There's a realistic chance that you might live a longer and healthier life, but should we really do it?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We explore this in our video.
