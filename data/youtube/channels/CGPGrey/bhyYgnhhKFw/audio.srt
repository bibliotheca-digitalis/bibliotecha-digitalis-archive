1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Look at that. What a waste. That queen living it off the government in her castles with

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,400
her corgis and gin. Just how much does this cost to maintain? 40 million pounds. That's

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,360
about 65 pence per person per year of tax money going to the royal family.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,280
Sure, it's still 23 pence short of a complete shield, but it might be more than you want

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,600
to pay. After all, those are your coins. Why does the queen get to steal them?

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,240
Well, it's a little complicated. The story starts with this guy, King George III, most

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,000
well known as the monarch who lost the United States for the empire. Less well known, but

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,800
far more interesting, is he likely suffered from a mental illness called prophyria, which

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,600
has the unusual side effect of transforming your poop from its normal boring brown into

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,600
a delightful shade of purple. But I digress. Back to the reason the royals get tax money.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,060
King George was having trouble paying his bills and he had racked up debt. While he

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,520
did own huge tracts of land, the profit from their rental was too small to cover his expenses.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,840
He offered parliament a deal. For the rest of his life he would surrender the profits

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,360
from the rents on his land in exchange for getting a fixed annual salary and having his

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,320
debts removed. Parliament took him up on the deal, guessing that the profits from the rent

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,440
would pay off long term. Just how well did parliament do from this? Back to the present

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,920
day, let's compare the profits and losses by using a tenor to represent 10 million pounds.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,760
The cost to maintain the royal family today is 40 million pounds per year, but the revenue

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,480
paid to the UK from the royal lands is 200 million pounds per year. 200 million in revenue

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,200
subtract 40 million in salary costs equals 160 million pounds in profit. That's right,

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,360
the United Kingdom earns 160 million pounds in profit every year from the royal family.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,040
Doing the math for an individual, 160 million pounds divided by 62 million people is about

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,680
2 pounds and 60 pence. Because of the royal family, your taxes are actually 2 pounds and

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,760
60 pence cheaper each year than they would otherwise be. But perhaps that's not enough

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,560
for you because you're a real greedy geezer. Why not kick the royals out and keep 100%

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,340
of the revenue? Because it's still their land. King George the crazy wasn't crazy enough

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,600
to give up everything, just the profits. But it wasn't only him. Every monarch since King

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,720
George the third has voluntarily turned over the profits from their land to the United

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,160
Kingdom. If the government stopped paying the royal family's living and state expenses,

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,800
the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land and your taxes, dear

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,160
monarchy haters, would go up not down. Plus 160 million is just the easily measurable

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
money the United Kingdom makes from the royal family. Don't forget their huge indirect

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
golden goose, tourists. Annoying though they might be to the locals by blocking the tube

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
and refusing to stand on the right, they dump buckets of money on the UK to see the sights,

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,660
travel ludicrously short distances by public transport and generally act silly a long way

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,600
from home. Sure, not everything they come to see is royal, but the most expensive stuff

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,120
is. And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks. After they've finished buying maple

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,360
syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, Tijuana professional services and illegal pharmaceuticals, where

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,000
do they go next? The United Kingdom. Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,560
castles that aren't plastic. And why do the Americans think France's castles are

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,700
so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome? Because real monarchs still

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,520
use them. The Tower of London is so stunning to visitors because the royal crest on the

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,240
yeoman warder's uniform is real. It's not a lame historical reenactment or a modern

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,340
larping quest, it's the embodiment of the living, breathing queen. Everywhere you look

45
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,240
she sprinkled fairy dust on banal objects to make them magically attractive to tourists,

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,760
12 million of whom visit every year spending 7,000 million pounds. Which suddenly makes

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,640
those direct profits look like rather small change. But perhaps you don't care that

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,240
the monarchs are a perpetual goldmine for the United Kingdom. You're a Republican

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,940
and you dislike the royal family because of their political power. After all, the government

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,480
derives its right to rule through the crown, not the people. And yes, I'll grant you

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,720
that back in the head choppy days of yore, this was a legitimate concern. But the modern

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,520
queen isn't a dangerous political lion, but a declawed kitten. Her powers are limited

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,520
to a kabuki theatre act of approving what parliament wants to do anyway. Remove the

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,720
royal family from government and fundamentally nothing would be different, except now you

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,000
wouldn't live in a magically united kingdom, but a rather dull, united republic of England,

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,280
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. AKA...er...eswiny for short. Doesn't quite have the same ring

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,880
to it. But maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the queen is a political ticking time bomb, just

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,080
waiting for her chance to declare random wars and dissolve parliament for the lulz. But

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,440
until that day comes, god save the queen. Thank you very much for watching.

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I'll see you next time.
