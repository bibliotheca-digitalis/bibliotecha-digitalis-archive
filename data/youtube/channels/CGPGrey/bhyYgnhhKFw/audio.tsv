0	4860	Look at that. What a waste. That queen living it off the government in her castles with
4860	10400	her corgis and gin. Just how much does this cost to maintain? 40 million pounds. That's
10400	14360	about 65 pence per person per year of tax money going to the royal family.
14360	18280	Sure, it's still 23 pence short of a complete shield, but it might be more than you want
18280	22600	to pay. After all, those are your coins. Why does the queen get to steal them?
22600	27240	Well, it's a little complicated. The story starts with this guy, King George III, most
27240	31000	well known as the monarch who lost the United States for the empire. Less well known, but
31000	34800	far more interesting, is he likely suffered from a mental illness called prophyria, which
34800	38600	has the unusual side effect of transforming your poop from its normal boring brown into
38600	43600	a delightful shade of purple. But I digress. Back to the reason the royals get tax money.
43600	47060	King George was having trouble paying his bills and he had racked up debt. While he
47060	51520	did own huge tracts of land, the profit from their rental was too small to cover his expenses.
51520	54840	He offered parliament a deal. For the rest of his life he would surrender the profits
54840	58360	from the rents on his land in exchange for getting a fixed annual salary and having his
58360	62320	debts removed. Parliament took him up on the deal, guessing that the profits from the rent
62320	66440	would pay off long term. Just how well did parliament do from this? Back to the present
66440	70920	day, let's compare the profits and losses by using a tenor to represent 10 million pounds.
70920	74760	The cost to maintain the royal family today is 40 million pounds per year, but the revenue
74760	80480	paid to the UK from the royal lands is 200 million pounds per year. 200 million in revenue
80480	86200	subtract 40 million in salary costs equals 160 million pounds in profit. That's right,
86200	93360	the United Kingdom earns 160 million pounds in profit every year from the royal family.
93360	98040	Doing the math for an individual, 160 million pounds divided by 62 million people is about
98040	102680	2 pounds and 60 pence. Because of the royal family, your taxes are actually 2 pounds and
102680	106760	60 pence cheaper each year than they would otherwise be. But perhaps that's not enough
106760	110560	for you because you're a real greedy geezer. Why not kick the royals out and keep 100%
110560	115340	of the revenue? Because it's still their land. King George the crazy wasn't crazy enough
115340	119600	to give up everything, just the profits. But it wasn't only him. Every monarch since King
119600	123720	George the third has voluntarily turned over the profits from their land to the United
123720	127160	Kingdom. If the government stopped paying the royal family's living and state expenses,
127160	130800	the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land and your taxes, dear
130800	136160	monarchy haters, would go up not down. Plus 160 million is just the easily measurable
136160	139520	money the United Kingdom makes from the royal family. Don't forget their huge indirect
139520	143680	golden goose, tourists. Annoying though they might be to the locals by blocking the tube
143680	147680	and refusing to stand on the right, they dump buckets of money on the UK to see the sights,
147680	151660	travel ludicrously short distances by public transport and generally act silly a long way
151660	155600	from home. Sure, not everything they come to see is royal, but the most expensive stuff
155600	160120	is. And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks. After they've finished buying maple
160120	164360	syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, Tijuana professional services and illegal pharmaceuticals, where
164360	169000	do they go next? The United Kingdom. Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with
169000	172560	castles that aren't plastic. And why do the Americans think France's castles are
172560	176700	so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome? Because real monarchs still
176700	180520	use them. The Tower of London is so stunning to visitors because the royal crest on the
180520	184240	yeoman warder's uniform is real. It's not a lame historical reenactment or a modern
184240	188340	larping quest, it's the embodiment of the living, breathing queen. Everywhere you look
188340	192240	she sprinkled fairy dust on banal objects to make them magically attractive to tourists,
192240	197760	12 million of whom visit every year spending 7,000 million pounds. Which suddenly makes
197760	201640	those direct profits look like rather small change. But perhaps you don't care that
201640	205240	the monarchs are a perpetual goldmine for the United Kingdom. You're a Republican
205240	208940	and you dislike the royal family because of their political power. After all, the government
208940	212480	derives its right to rule through the crown, not the people. And yes, I'll grant you
212480	215720	that back in the head choppy days of yore, this was a legitimate concern. But the modern
215720	219520	queen isn't a dangerous political lion, but a declawed kitten. Her powers are limited
219520	223520	to a kabuki theatre act of approving what parliament wants to do anyway. Remove the
223520	226720	royal family from government and fundamentally nothing would be different, except now you
226720	231000	wouldn't live in a magically united kingdom, but a rather dull, united republic of England,
231000	237280	Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. AKA...er...eswiny for short. Doesn't quite have the same ring
237280	241880	to it. But maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the queen is a political ticking time bomb, just
241880	246080	waiting for her chance to declare random wars and dissolve parliament for the lulz. But
246080	249440	until that day comes, god save the queen. Thank you very much for watching.
249520	251520	I'll see you next time.
