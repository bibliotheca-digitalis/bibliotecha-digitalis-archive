00:00.000 --> 00:04.860
Look at that. What a waste. That queen living it off the government in her castles with

00:04.860 --> 00:10.400
her corgis and gin. Just how much does this cost to maintain? 40 million pounds. That's

00:10.400 --> 00:14.360
about 65 pence per person per year of tax money going to the royal family.

00:14.360 --> 00:18.280
Sure, it's still 23 pence short of a complete shield, but it might be more than you want

00:18.280 --> 00:22.600
to pay. After all, those are your coins. Why does the queen get to steal them?

00:22.600 --> 00:27.240
Well, it's a little complicated. The story starts with this guy, King George III, most

00:27.240 --> 00:31.000
well known as the monarch who lost the United States for the empire. Less well known, but

00:31.000 --> 00:34.800
far more interesting, is he likely suffered from a mental illness called prophyria, which

00:34.800 --> 00:38.600
has the unusual side effect of transforming your poop from its normal boring brown into

00:38.600 --> 00:43.600
a delightful shade of purple. But I digress. Back to the reason the royals get tax money.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.060
King George was having trouble paying his bills and he had racked up debt. While he

00:47.060 --> 00:51.520
did own huge tracts of land, the profit from their rental was too small to cover his expenses.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.840
He offered parliament a deal. For the rest of his life he would surrender the profits

00:54.840 --> 00:58.360
from the rents on his land in exchange for getting a fixed annual salary and having his

00:58.360 --> 01:02.320
debts removed. Parliament took him up on the deal, guessing that the profits from the rent

01:02.320 --> 01:06.440
would pay off long term. Just how well did parliament do from this? Back to the present

01:06.440 --> 01:10.920
day, let's compare the profits and losses by using a tenor to represent 10 million pounds.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.760
The cost to maintain the royal family today is 40 million pounds per year, but the revenue

01:14.760 --> 01:20.480
paid to the UK from the royal lands is 200 million pounds per year. 200 million in revenue

01:20.480 --> 01:26.200
subtract 40 million in salary costs equals 160 million pounds in profit. That's right,

01:26.200 --> 01:33.360
the United Kingdom earns 160 million pounds in profit every year from the royal family.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.040
Doing the math for an individual, 160 million pounds divided by 62 million people is about

01:38.040 --> 01:42.680
2 pounds and 60 pence. Because of the royal family, your taxes are actually 2 pounds and

01:42.680 --> 01:46.760
60 pence cheaper each year than they would otherwise be. But perhaps that's not enough

01:46.760 --> 01:50.560
for you because you're a real greedy geezer. Why not kick the royals out and keep 100%

01:50.560 --> 01:55.340
of the revenue? Because it's still their land. King George the crazy wasn't crazy enough

01:55.340 --> 01:59.600
to give up everything, just the profits. But it wasn't only him. Every monarch since King

01:59.600 --> 02:03.720
George the third has voluntarily turned over the profits from their land to the United

02:03.720 --> 02:07.160
Kingdom. If the government stopped paying the royal family's living and state expenses,

02:07.160 --> 02:10.800
the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land and your taxes, dear

02:10.800 --> 02:16.160
monarchy haters, would go up not down. Plus 160 million is just the easily measurable

02:16.160 --> 02:19.520
money the United Kingdom makes from the royal family. Don't forget their huge indirect

02:19.520 --> 02:23.680
golden goose, tourists. Annoying though they might be to the locals by blocking the tube

02:23.680 --> 02:27.680
and refusing to stand on the right, they dump buckets of money on the UK to see the sights,

02:27.680 --> 02:31.660
travel ludicrously short distances by public transport and generally act silly a long way

02:31.660 --> 02:35.600
from home. Sure, not everything they come to see is royal, but the most expensive stuff

02:35.600 --> 02:40.120
is. And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks. After they've finished buying maple

02:40.120 --> 02:44.360
syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, Tijuana professional services and illegal pharmaceuticals, where

02:44.360 --> 02:49.000
do they go next? The United Kingdom. Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with

02:49.000 --> 02:52.560
castles that aren't plastic. And why do the Americans think France's castles are

02:52.560 --> 02:56.700
so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome? Because real monarchs still

02:56.700 --> 03:00.520
use them. The Tower of London is so stunning to visitors because the royal crest on the

03:00.520 --> 03:04.240
yeoman warder's uniform is real. It's not a lame historical reenactment or a modern

03:04.240 --> 03:08.340
larping quest, it's the embodiment of the living, breathing queen. Everywhere you look

03:08.340 --> 03:12.240
she sprinkled fairy dust on banal objects to make them magically attractive to tourists,

03:12.240 --> 03:17.760
12 million of whom visit every year spending 7,000 million pounds. Which suddenly makes

03:17.760 --> 03:21.640
those direct profits look like rather small change. But perhaps you don't care that

03:21.640 --> 03:25.240
the monarchs are a perpetual goldmine for the United Kingdom. You're a Republican

03:25.240 --> 03:28.940
and you dislike the royal family because of their political power. After all, the government

03:28.940 --> 03:32.480
derives its right to rule through the crown, not the people. And yes, I'll grant you

03:32.480 --> 03:35.720
that back in the head choppy days of yore, this was a legitimate concern. But the modern

03:35.720 --> 03:39.520
queen isn't a dangerous political lion, but a declawed kitten. Her powers are limited

03:39.520 --> 03:43.520
to a kabuki theatre act of approving what parliament wants to do anyway. Remove the

03:43.520 --> 03:46.720
royal family from government and fundamentally nothing would be different, except now you

03:46.720 --> 03:51.000
wouldn't live in a magically united kingdom, but a rather dull, united republic of England,

03:51.000 --> 03:57.280
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. AKA...er...eswiny for short. Doesn't quite have the same ring

03:57.280 --> 04:01.880
to it. But maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the queen is a political ticking time bomb, just

04:01.880 --> 04:06.080
waiting for her chance to declare random wars and dissolve parliament for the lulz. But

04:06.080 --> 04:09.440
until that day comes, god save the queen. Thank you very much for watching.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.520
I'll see you next time.
