1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Canada and the United States share the longest, straightest, possibly boringest border in the world.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,300
But look closer and there's plenty of bizarreness to be found.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,900
While these sister nations get along fairly well, they both want to make it really clear whose side of the continent is whose.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,700
And they've done this by carving a 20-foot wide space along the border.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,100
All five and a half thousand miles of it.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,400
With the exception of the rare New England town that predates national borders or the odd airport that needed expanding,

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,800
this space is the no-touching zone between the countries and they're super serious about keeping it clear.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,000
It matters not if the no-touching zone runs through hundreds of miles of virtually uninhabited Alaskan Yukon wilderness.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,200
Those border trees will not stand.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,800
Which might make you think this must be the longest, straightest, deforested place in the world.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,600
But it isn't.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,300
Deforested, yes. But straight, not at all.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,500
Sure, it looks straight on a map and the treaties establishing the lines say it's straight.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,800
But in the real world, the official border is 900 lines that zigzag from the horizontal by as much as several hundred feet.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
How did this happen?

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,700
Well, imagine you're back in North America in the 1800s.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,200
The 49th parallel, one of those horizontal lines you see on the globe, has just been set as the national boundary.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
And it's your job to make it real.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,900
You are handed a compass and a ball of string and told to carefully mark off the next two-thirds of a continent.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,300
Don't mind that uncharted wilderness in your way, just keep the line straight.

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,400
Yeah, good luck with that.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,300
The men who surveyed the land did the best they could and built over 900 monuments.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,300
They're in about as straight a line as you could expect a pre-GPS civilization to make.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,700
But it's not the kind of spherical, planar intersection that would bring a mathematician joy.

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Nonetheless, these monuments define the border and the no-touching zone plays connect the dots with them.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh, and while there are about 900 markers along this section of the border,

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,400
there are about 8,000 in total that define the shape of the nations.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,300
Despite this massive project, Canada and the United States still have disputed territory.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,400
There's a series of islands in the Atlantic that the United States claims are part of Maine

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,700
and Canada claims are part of New Brunswick.

31
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,800
Canada, assuming the islands are hers, built a lighthouse on one of them

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,200
and the United States, assuming the islands are hers, pretends the lighthouse doesn't exist.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,500
It's not a huge problem as the argument is mostly over tourists who want to see puffins

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,200
and fishermen who want to catch lobsters,

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,900
but let's hope the disagreement gets resolved before someone finds oil under that lighthouse.

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,000
Even the non-disputed territory has a few notably weird spots,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,300
such as this tick of the border upward into Canada.

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Zoom in and it gets stranger as the border isn't over solid land

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,500
but runs through a lake to cut off a bit of Canada before diving back down to the US.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,300
This spot is home to about 100 Americans and is a perfect example of how border irregularities are born.

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Back in 1783, when the victorious Americans were negotiating with the British

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,800
who controlled what would one day be Canada, they needed a map

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
and this map was the best available at the time.

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,700
While the East Coast looks pretty good, the wester it goes, the sparser it gets.

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,800
Under negotiation was the edge of what would one day be Minnesota and Manitoba,

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
but unfortunately that area was hidden underneath an inset on the map

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
so the Americans and the British were bordering blind.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Seriously.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
They guessed the border should start from the northwestern part of this lake

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and go in a horizontal line until it crossed the Mississippi... somewhere.

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,700
But somewhere turned out to be nowhere as the mighty Mississippi stopped short of that line

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,000
which left the border vague until 35 years later when a second round of negotiations

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,700
established the aforementioned 49th parallel.

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,400
But there was still a problem as the lake mentioned earlier was both higher and less circular than first thought

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,500
putting its northwesterly point here so the existing border had to jump up to meet it

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
and then drop straight down to the 49th, awkwardly cutting off a bit of Canada

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,900
before heading west to the remainder of the continent.

58
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,400
And it turns out you can't just draw a straight-ish line for hundreds of miles

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
without causing a few more problems.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,400
One of which was luckily spotted in advance, Vancouver Island

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
which the 49th would have sliced through but both sides agreed that would be dumb

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,300
so the border swoops around the island.

63
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,000
However, next door to Vancouver Island is Point Roberts

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,600
which went unnoticed and thus today the border blithely cuts across.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,800
It's a nice little town home to over a thousand Americans but has only a primary school

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,000
so its older kids have to cross international borders four times a day to go to school in their own state.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,200
In a pleasing symmetry, the East Coast has the exact opposite situation

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,000
with a Canadian island whose only land route is a bridge from the United States.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,800
And these two aren't the only places where each country contains a bit of the other.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,000
There are several more easily spotted in satellite photos by the No Touching Zone.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,400
Regardless of if the land in question is just an uninhabited strip

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
in the middle of a lake in the middle of nowhere,

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,200
the border between these sister nations must remain clearly marked.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,660
