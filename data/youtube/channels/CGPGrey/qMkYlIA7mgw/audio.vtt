00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
Canada and the United States share the longest, straightest, possibly boringest border in the world.

00:05.100 --> 00:08.300
But look closer and there's plenty of bizarreness to be found.

00:08.300 --> 00:13.900
While these sister nations get along fairly well, they both want to make it really clear whose side of the continent is whose.

00:13.900 --> 00:17.700
And they've done this by carving a 20-foot wide space along the border.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.100
All five and a half thousand miles of it.

00:21.100 --> 00:26.400
With the exception of the rare New England town that predates national borders or the odd airport that needed expanding,

00:26.400 --> 00:31.800
this space is the no-touching zone between the countries and they're super serious about keeping it clear.

00:31.800 --> 00:38.000
It matters not if the no-touching zone runs through hundreds of miles of virtually uninhabited Alaskan Yukon wilderness.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.200
Those border trees will not stand.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.800
Which might make you think this must be the longest, straightest, deforested place in the world.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.600
But it isn't.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.300
Deforested, yes. But straight, not at all.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.500
Sure, it looks straight on a map and the treaties establishing the lines say it's straight.

00:52.500 --> 00:59.800
But in the real world, the official border is 900 lines that zigzag from the horizontal by as much as several hundred feet.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
How did this happen?

01:00.800 --> 01:03.700
Well, imagine you're back in North America in the 1800s.

01:03.700 --> 01:09.200
The 49th parallel, one of those horizontal lines you see on the globe, has just been set as the national boundary.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.000
And it's your job to make it real.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.900
You are handed a compass and a ball of string and told to carefully mark off the next two-thirds of a continent.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.300
Don't mind that uncharted wilderness in your way, just keep the line straight.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.400
Yeah, good luck with that.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.300
The men who surveyed the land did the best they could and built over 900 monuments.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.300
They're in about as straight a line as you could expect a pre-GPS civilization to make.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.700
But it's not the kind of spherical, planar intersection that would bring a mathematician joy.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.700
Nonetheless, these monuments define the border and the no-touching zone plays connect the dots with them.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.200
Oh, and while there are about 900 markers along this section of the border,

01:43.200 --> 01:47.400
there are about 8,000 in total that define the shape of the nations.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.300
Despite this massive project, Canada and the United States still have disputed territory.

01:52.300 --> 01:56.400
There's a series of islands in the Atlantic that the United States claims are part of Maine

01:56.400 --> 01:58.700
and Canada claims are part of New Brunswick.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.800
Canada, assuming the islands are hers, built a lighthouse on one of them

02:01.800 --> 02:06.200
and the United States, assuming the islands are hers, pretends the lighthouse doesn't exist.

02:06.200 --> 02:10.500
It's not a huge problem as the argument is mostly over tourists who want to see puffins

02:10.500 --> 02:12.200
and fishermen who want to catch lobsters,

02:12.200 --> 02:16.900
but let's hope the disagreement gets resolved before someone finds oil under that lighthouse.

02:16.900 --> 02:20.000
Even the non-disputed territory has a few notably weird spots,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.300
such as this tick of the border upward into Canada.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.300
Zoom in and it gets stranger as the border isn't over solid land

02:25.300 --> 02:29.500
but runs through a lake to cut off a bit of Canada before diving back down to the US.

02:29.500 --> 02:34.300
This spot is home to about 100 Americans and is a perfect example of how border irregularities are born.

02:34.300 --> 02:38.300
Back in 1783, when the victorious Americans were negotiating with the British

02:38.300 --> 02:40.800
who controlled what would one day be Canada, they needed a map

02:40.800 --> 02:43.600
and this map was the best available at the time.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.700
While the East Coast looks pretty good, the wester it goes, the sparser it gets.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.800
Under negotiation was the edge of what would one day be Minnesota and Manitoba,

02:51.800 --> 02:55.800
but unfortunately that area was hidden underneath an inset on the map

02:55.800 --> 02:59.000
so the Americans and the British were bordering blind.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Seriously.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.200
They guessed the border should start from the northwestern part of this lake

03:03.200 --> 03:07.200
and go in a horizontal line until it crossed the Mississippi... somewhere.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.700
But somewhere turned out to be nowhere as the mighty Mississippi stopped short of that line

03:11.700 --> 03:16.000
which left the border vague until 35 years later when a second round of negotiations

03:16.000 --> 03:18.700
established the aforementioned 49th parallel.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.400
But there was still a problem as the lake mentioned earlier was both higher and less circular than first thought

03:23.400 --> 03:27.500
putting its northwesterly point here so the existing border had to jump up to meet it

03:27.500 --> 03:31.500
and then drop straight down to the 49th, awkwardly cutting off a bit of Canada

03:31.500 --> 03:33.900
before heading west to the remainder of the continent.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.400
And it turns out you can't just draw a straight-ish line for hundreds of miles

03:37.400 --> 03:39.400
without causing a few more problems.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.400
One of which was luckily spotted in advance, Vancouver Island

03:42.400 --> 03:46.400
which the 49th would have sliced through but both sides agreed that would be dumb

03:46.400 --> 03:48.300
so the border swoops around the island.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.000
However, next door to Vancouver Island is Point Roberts

03:51.000 --> 03:54.600
which went unnoticed and thus today the border blithely cuts across.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.800
It's a nice little town home to over a thousand Americans but has only a primary school

03:58.800 --> 04:04.000
so its older kids have to cross international borders four times a day to go to school in their own state.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.200
In a pleasing symmetry, the East Coast has the exact opposite situation

04:07.200 --> 04:11.000
with a Canadian island whose only land route is a bridge from the United States.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.800
And these two aren't the only places where each country contains a bit of the other.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.000
There are several more easily spotted in satellite photos by the No Touching Zone.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.400
Regardless of if the land in question is just an uninhabited strip

04:22.400 --> 04:24.800
in the middle of a lake in the middle of nowhere,

04:24.800 --> 04:29.200
the border between these sister nations must remain clearly marked.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.660
