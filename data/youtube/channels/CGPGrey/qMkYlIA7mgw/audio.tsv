0	5100	Canada and the United States share the longest, straightest, possibly boringest border in the world.
5100	8300	But look closer and there's plenty of bizarreness to be found.
8300	13900	While these sister nations get along fairly well, they both want to make it really clear whose side of the continent is whose.
13900	17700	And they've done this by carving a 20-foot wide space along the border.
17700	21100	All five and a half thousand miles of it.
21100	26400	With the exception of the rare New England town that predates national borders or the odd airport that needed expanding,
26400	31800	this space is the no-touching zone between the countries and they're super serious about keeping it clear.
31800	38000	It matters not if the no-touching zone runs through hundreds of miles of virtually uninhabited Alaskan Yukon wilderness.
38000	40200	Those border trees will not stand.
40200	44800	Which might make you think this must be the longest, straightest, deforested place in the world.
44800	45600	But it isn't.
45600	48300	Deforested, yes. But straight, not at all.
48300	52500	Sure, it looks straight on a map and the treaties establishing the lines say it's straight.
52500	59800	But in the real world, the official border is 900 lines that zigzag from the horizontal by as much as several hundred feet.
59800	60800	How did this happen?
60800	63700	Well, imagine you're back in North America in the 1800s.
63700	69200	The 49th parallel, one of those horizontal lines you see on the globe, has just been set as the national boundary.
69200	71000	And it's your job to make it real.
71000	76900	You are handed a compass and a ball of string and told to carefully mark off the next two-thirds of a continent.
76900	80300	Don't mind that uncharted wilderness in your way, just keep the line straight.
80300	82400	Yeah, good luck with that.
82400	86300	The men who surveyed the land did the best they could and built over 900 monuments.
86300	90300	They're in about as straight a line as you could expect a pre-GPS civilization to make.
90300	94700	But it's not the kind of spherical, planar intersection that would bring a mathematician joy.
94700	99700	Nonetheless, these monuments define the border and the no-touching zone plays connect the dots with them.
99700	103200	Oh, and while there are about 900 markers along this section of the border,
103200	107400	there are about 8,000 in total that define the shape of the nations.
107400	112300	Despite this massive project, Canada and the United States still have disputed territory.
112300	116400	There's a series of islands in the Atlantic that the United States claims are part of Maine
116400	118700	and Canada claims are part of New Brunswick.
118700	121800	Canada, assuming the islands are hers, built a lighthouse on one of them
121800	126200	and the United States, assuming the islands are hers, pretends the lighthouse doesn't exist.
126200	130500	It's not a huge problem as the argument is mostly over tourists who want to see puffins
130500	132200	and fishermen who want to catch lobsters,
132200	136900	but let's hope the disagreement gets resolved before someone finds oil under that lighthouse.
136900	140000	Even the non-disputed territory has a few notably weird spots,
140000	142300	such as this tick of the border upward into Canada.
142300	145300	Zoom in and it gets stranger as the border isn't over solid land
145300	149500	but runs through a lake to cut off a bit of Canada before diving back down to the US.
149500	154300	This spot is home to about 100 Americans and is a perfect example of how border irregularities are born.
154300	158300	Back in 1783, when the victorious Americans were negotiating with the British
158300	160800	who controlled what would one day be Canada, they needed a map
160800	163600	and this map was the best available at the time.
163600	167700	While the East Coast looks pretty good, the wester it goes, the sparser it gets.
167700	171800	Under negotiation was the edge of what would one day be Minnesota and Manitoba,
171800	175800	but unfortunately that area was hidden underneath an inset on the map
175800	179000	so the Americans and the British were bordering blind.
179000	180000	Seriously.
180000	183200	They guessed the border should start from the northwestern part of this lake
183200	187200	and go in a horizontal line until it crossed the Mississippi... somewhere.
187200	191700	But somewhere turned out to be nowhere as the mighty Mississippi stopped short of that line
191700	196000	which left the border vague until 35 years later when a second round of negotiations
196000	198700	established the aforementioned 49th parallel.
198700	203400	But there was still a problem as the lake mentioned earlier was both higher and less circular than first thought
203400	207500	putting its northwesterly point here so the existing border had to jump up to meet it
207500	211500	and then drop straight down to the 49th, awkwardly cutting off a bit of Canada
211500	213900	before heading west to the remainder of the continent.
213900	217400	And it turns out you can't just draw a straight-ish line for hundreds of miles
217400	219400	without causing a few more problems.
219400	222400	One of which was luckily spotted in advance, Vancouver Island
222400	226400	which the 49th would have sliced through but both sides agreed that would be dumb
226400	228300	so the border swoops around the island.
228300	231000	However, next door to Vancouver Island is Point Roberts
231000	234600	which went unnoticed and thus today the border blithely cuts across.
234600	238800	It's a nice little town home to over a thousand Americans but has only a primary school
238800	244000	so its older kids have to cross international borders four times a day to go to school in their own state.
244000	247200	In a pleasing symmetry, the East Coast has the exact opposite situation
247200	251000	with a Canadian island whose only land route is a bridge from the United States.
251000	254800	And these two aren't the only places where each country contains a bit of the other.
254800	259000	There are several more easily spotted in satellite photos by the No Touching Zone.
259000	262400	Regardless of if the land in question is just an uninhabited strip
262400	264800	in the middle of a lake in the middle of nowhere,
264800	269200	the border between these sister nations must remain clearly marked.
281000	283660	you
