0	2080	Hello, internet.
2080	4800	So I think this is the part where I'm supposed to have a dramatic opening.
4800	8840	Perhaps the 2001 theme song playing in the background as the number one million slowly
8840	12920	fades into view, but obviously that's not happening.
12920	15880	Don't get me wrong, I'm lucky that so many people want to watch my videos, it's just
15880	20840	that one million subscribers is a number too large to be comprehended with a monkey-derived
20840	21840	brain.
21840	25440	To try and have it feel more real, I've taken some YouTube data and made a spreadsheet.
25440	28480	You can select your country and enter the population of the city where you live and
28480	32680	it will spit out the statistically approximate number of people in that city who are subscribed
32680	33680	to this channel.
33680	37800	Doing that for London shows there are about 9,000 people in the city who are subscribers.
37800	42800	Now, 9,000 is obviously a smaller number than one million, but it's a number with constraints
42800	48960	and is small enough to be partially understood while still large enough to be very intimidating.
48960	51600	If you're interested, you can click here to play around with the spreadsheet.
51600	54000	Now, as promised, on to the Q&A.
54000	55640	What do you like most about being a YouTuber?
55640	59000	The best thing about this strange new world is the people I've met, which is quite the
59000	61180	statement for a social recluse to make.
61180	65040	All these guys are amazing to talk with and I feel very lucky that I get the occasional
65040	66040	chance to do so.
66040	68120	What's the biggest change of opinion you've had?
68120	71920	That's a little too personal to share with, say, one million people, but I do want to
71920	75020	talk about the importance of being able to change your mind in general.
75020	77880	The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions.
77880	82520	They are objects in a box you carry with you and should be easily replaceable if it turns
82520	83680	out they're no good.
83720	86720	If you think that the opinions in the box are who you are, then you'll cling to them
86720	88720	despite any evidence to the contrary.
88720	92440	Bottom line, if you want to always be right, you need to always be prepared to change your
92440	93440	mind.
93440	95840	Were you trying to create a unique aesthetic by using stick figures?
95840	97800	No, it's just that I can't draw.
97800	100780	After moving to London, how long did it take until you stopped saying math and started
100780	101780	saying maths?
101780	102780	I haven't.
102780	103780	I'm sticking with math.
103780	107060	Americans in the UK often end up with an unfortunate accent I call pseudo-British.
107060	111320	I try very hard to avoid this, but when you've spent the majority of your talking time with
111320	115800	British people over a decade, it's impossible to completely fight the creeping pseudo-British
115800	118560	accent no matter how abhorrent you think it makes you sound.
118560	120440	Did your students know about your YouTube channel?
120440	122920	I would never talk about it, but I know some of them knew.
122920	125680	However, it's impossible to express how little they cared.
125680	129000	My classes were not like hour-long CGP Grey videos.
129000	131400	Would you like to see the interrobang more widely adopted?
131400	132400	Who wouldn't?
132400	133680	Why don't you have an upload schedule?
133680	137640	Right, the big question, usually phrased in the YouTube comment section as, why you no
137640	138640	make more vids.
138960	142760	So on average, over the past couple years, I've posted a Grey Explains video about every
142760	147920	five weeks, which means if I could switch to a weekly schedule, my income would quintuple.
147920	150020	Trust me, I would if I could.
150020	153180	I've talked before about how long it takes to make these videos, but one of the other
153180	156640	problems I haven't mentioned is the failure rate of projects.
156640	160260	For every video you see, there's at least three or four that didn't make it.
160260	163840	Most of the time, that's just a lost afternoon working on an idea before realizing it's a
163840	167800	dud, but sometimes it's weeks before a fatal flaw reveals itself.
167800	171240	Sometimes I'll discover too late that a central fact of the video isn't correct or sometimes
171240	173920	the whole script is just unfixably boring.
173920	177760	Either way, the decision to kill a video that isn't working is depressing and frustrating
177760	180520	because of the sunk cost of all those hours.
180520	184880	The videos you see are mostly pretty good precisely because I try my best to kill the
184880	186160	ones that weren't.
186160	189720	That's why there isn't a schedule and there never can be.
189720	191160	What's the biggest video you killed?
191160	196120	The most time I ever lost was on a very important video to convince the world why Settlers of
196120	198600	Catan is the greatest board game ever made.
198600	201800	I had a couple thousand words as a starting point, harassed some people for footage of
201800	205560	a now-famous game that took place at YouTube EDU, got a bunch of random videos from my
205560	209220	ever-helpful Twitter followers and had an outline for a how-to-play Settlers of Catan
209220	211160	tutorial for my second channel.
211160	214660	But the script kept growing and growing and began to look more like a documentary film
214660	218600	on board game design than a YouTube video which might, depending on who you are, sound
218600	222480	really interesting but it had the boring problem I mentioned before.
222480	225640	My last-ditch effort to save a project like this is to get rid of everything, work on
226160	229840	something else for a little while and then write a brand new script by hand which I did.
229840	234280	But that script still wasn't good and weeks after starting the project I had to shelve
234280	235280	it.
235280	239400	But I'm still talking about it because it's an idea that I just can't let go and might
239400	241040	come back to someday.
241040	243220	Why don't you hire people to help you?
243220	247200	That's a big topic that deserves its own video but for now let me just say the kind of work
247200	251440	produced by individuals is very different than the kind of work produced by groups.
251440	255400	One isn't intrinsically better than the other but I think the kinds of videos I've made
256160	259120	have all benefited from being a one-man project from start to finish.
259120	260280	Your opinion on koalas.
260280	264240	They sleep 20 hours a day, never going to be a koala-based civilization with that kind
264240	265240	of work ethic.
265240	267760	If you could transfer your brain into a robotic body, would you?
267760	269000	Obviously yes.
269000	271280	You can add three amendments to the US Constitution.
271280	272280	What do they do?
272280	274880	Oh, so many tempting changes to make.
274880	278680	Off the top of my head I'd say, first, abolish private funding of all elections and instead
278680	282840	make them run from a limited pool of tax money, second, abolish the Senate and replace it
282840	286800	with some kind of proportional body, and third, overturn the interstate commerce clause
286800	290560	which basically gives the federal government a little too much power over the affairs of
290560	291560	the states.
291560	295640	Of course, if it was actually my responsibility to change three things, I'd consult with some
295640	299120	experts rather than just idly mull it over for a couple days.
299120	301240	What advice would you give for a successful life?
301240	303920	Build a self-evaluation loop into your life.
303920	308560	If you don't periodically review your actions and how they've turned out and your decision-making
308560	313400	process then there's no hope for your life to improve other than just by random chance.
313400	317600	I do very small weekly reviews and bigger quarterly and yearly reviews of how my life
317600	321760	is going and how I might want it to be different in both the biggest and smallest ways and
321760	324600	what actions I need to take to try and achieve that.
324600	326540	That's the best high-level advice I have.
326540	330560	For more tactical advice I recommend two books, one that changed my life, Getting Things Done
330560	334720	by David Allen, and another that might change yours, So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal
334720	335720	Newport.
335720	338120	You can click these books to read my reviews of them.
338120	340240	Have you made a video you didn't like how it came out?
340240	344680	With the possible exception of the 2012 and Holland videos, I'm unhappy with all of them.
344680	348320	I don't watch my videos after upload if I can possibly avoid it.
348320	351200	To me, each is a graveyard of the could-have-been.
351200	353240	Favorite non-educational YouTube channels?
353240	356960	First, Glove and Boots, who I'm surprised haven't yet gotten all the subscribers, and
356960	361760	second, I'm a huge fan of Yahtzee, the Roger Ebert of video game reviews.
361760	363600	What was your first memory of the internet?
363600	365320	Mine is playing Flash games.
365320	366320	Mine is BBSs.
366320	369680	Now get off my lawn and go watch this documentary, you whippersnapper.
369680	370880	Who are your heroes?
370880	372360	Mostly Dark Seer and Necrolite.
372360	374120	What do you find hardest when making a video?
374120	377480	Writing the script is the hardest and it's unfortunately the bottleneck for the whole
377480	378480	process.
378480	381160	The most uncomfortable part is editing the audio.
381160	384880	Just like everyone else, there's a voice in my head that I like and a voice on the tape
384880	385920	that I don't.
385920	388200	Have any of your answers from the previous Q&A changed?
388200	390760	You're probably referring to these and no.
390760	392840	How long would you survive a zombie apocalypse?
392840	393840	I wouldn't.
393840	399000	The Walking Dead-style zombie apocalypse arises, the correct course of action is clearly suicide.
399000	400740	What do you listen to while making videos?
400740	404720	My most reliable writing music is Girl Talks All Day, which I would link to on YouTube
404720	407120	but it's copyright infringement-tastic.
407120	410680	You can get it from his website and if you like remixes, you should give it a listen.
410680	414640	However, I often get some random terrible song in my head while writing and end up buying
414640	417500	it and putting it on repeat for hours.
417500	423020	For this script, my iTunes reveals I listen to a single song 127 times and while that
423020	427180	might be torture in some jurisdictions, the repetitiveness really zones me into writing.
427180	432460	Animating, however, is incredibly tedious so I listen to a ton of audiobooks and podcasts
432460	433460	to keep my sanity.
433460	436180	What's the most interesting could-have-been of history?
436180	439420	Historical could-have-beens mostly strike me as a missing-the-point thought exercise.
439420	443420	The real driver of history is neither great men nor the actions of the masses but the
443420	447700	ceaseless march of science and technology which is mostly indifferent to the imaginary
447700	449740	lines drawn by packs of monkeys.
449740	453300	Knowing my perspective, you'll see why if I had to pick one, it would be this primitive
453300	456340	Greek steam engine invented 2,000 years ago.
456340	459900	There are reasons why it wasn't developed further but if some rich Greek had gotten
459900	463780	obsessed with the technology, perhaps we would have had an industrial revolution two millennia
463780	468580	earlier and we'd now be a transgalactic post-singularity civilization with robot bodies.
468580	471540	What's the most British thing you've encountered that you can't get your head around?
471540	476340	The idea that the best way to cool down on a hot summer day while confined to a non-air-conditioned
476340	478780	office is to drink hot tea.
478780	479780	Madness.
479780	481540	Absolute madness.
481540	483260	Should we create a universal language?
483260	485780	We already have, it's just not very universal.
485780	487820	What question do you want me to ask the most?
487820	488820	Hmm.
488820	492500	I love your videos and have even watched this somewhat tedious one until the very end.
492500	493860	How can I help support you?
493860	495680	I'm glad you asked, Gregorianhawk.
495680	499180	The best way is through a subscription at Subbable where you can get signed posters
499180	503360	and other stuff and there's also t-shirts and addiction mugs and flamethrowers over
503360	504360	at DFTBA.
504360	508400	Well, Internet, it's been fun and I'm sorry if your question didn't make it into this
508400	513080	video there were loads I had to cut but now that we're in this realm of numbers so big
513080	517580	they don't make sense, perhaps I'll turn Q&As into an occasional random thing rather than
517580	520600	a waiting for an arbitrary base 10 rollover thing.
520600	524520	Thank you again to everyone for your continued support and thank you for subscribing and
524520	525520	watching.
525520	527520	The last two years have been quite a ride.
