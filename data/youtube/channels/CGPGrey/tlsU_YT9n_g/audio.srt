00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Hello, internet.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,800
So I think this is the part where I'm supposed to have a dramatic opening.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,840
Perhaps the 2001 theme song playing in the background as the number one million slowly

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,920
fades into view, but obviously that's not happening.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,880
Don't get me wrong, I'm lucky that so many people want to watch my videos, it's just

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,840
that one million subscribers is a number too large to be comprehended with a monkey-derived

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
brain.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,440
To try and have it feel more real, I've taken some YouTube data and made a spreadsheet.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,480
You can select your country and enter the population of the city where you live and

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,680
it will spit out the statistically approximate number of people in that city who are subscribed

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
to this channel.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,800
Doing that for London shows there are about 9,000 people in the city who are subscribers.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Now, 9,000 is obviously a smaller number than one million, but it's a number with constraints

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,960
and is small enough to be partially understood while still large enough to be very intimidating.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
If you're interested, you can click here to play around with the spreadsheet.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, as promised, on to the Q&A.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,640
What do you like most about being a YouTuber?

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,000
The best thing about this strange new world is the people I've met, which is quite the

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,180
statement for a social recluse to make.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,040
All these guys are amazing to talk with and I feel very lucky that I get the occasional

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
chance to do so.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,120
What's the biggest change of opinion you've had?

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,920
That's a little too personal to share with, say, one million people, but I do want to

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,020
talk about the importance of being able to change your mind in general.

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,880
The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,520
They are objects in a box you carry with you and should be easily replaceable if it turns

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,680
out they're no good.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,720
If you think that the opinions in the box are who you are, then you'll cling to them

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
despite any evidence to the contrary.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,440
Bottom line, if you want to always be right, you need to always be prepared to change your

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
mind.

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,840
Were you trying to create a unique aesthetic by using stick figures?

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,800
No, it's just that I can't draw.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,780
After moving to London, how long did it take until you stopped saying math and started

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
saying maths?

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
I haven't.

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,780
I'm sticking with math.

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,060
Americans in the UK often end up with an unfortunate accent I call pseudo-British.

39
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,320
I try very hard to avoid this, but when you've spent the majority of your talking time with

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,800
British people over a decade, it's impossible to completely fight the creeping pseudo-British

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,560
accent no matter how abhorrent you think it makes you sound.

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,440
Did your students know about your YouTube channel?

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,920
I would never talk about it, but I know some of them knew.

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,680
However, it's impossible to express how little they cared.

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,000
My classes were not like hour-long CGP Grey videos.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Would you like to see the interrobang more widely adopted?

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Who wouldn't?

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
Why don't you have an upload schedule?

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,640
Right, the big question, usually phrased in the YouTube comment section as, why you no

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
make more vids.

51
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,760
So on average, over the past couple years, I've posted a Grey Explains video about every

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,920
five weeks, which means if I could switch to a weekly schedule, my income would quintuple.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,020
Trust me, I would if I could.

54
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,180
I've talked before about how long it takes to make these videos, but one of the other

55
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,640
problems I haven't mentioned is the failure rate of projects.

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,260
For every video you see, there's at least three or four that didn't make it.

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,840
Most of the time, that's just a lost afternoon working on an idea before realizing it's a

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,800
dud, but sometimes it's weeks before a fatal flaw reveals itself.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,240
Sometimes I'll discover too late that a central fact of the video isn't correct or sometimes

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,920
the whole script is just unfixably boring.

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
Either way, the decision to kill a video that isn't working is depressing and frustrating

62
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,520
because of the sunk cost of all those hours.

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,880
The videos you see are mostly pretty good precisely because I try my best to kill the

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,160
ones that weren't.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,720
That's why there isn't a schedule and there never can be.

66
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,160
What's the biggest video you killed?

67
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,120
The most time I ever lost was on a very important video to convince the world why Settlers of

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,600
Catan is the greatest board game ever made.

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,800
I had a couple thousand words as a starting point, harassed some people for footage of

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,560
a now-famous game that took place at YouTube EDU, got a bunch of random videos from my

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,220
ever-helpful Twitter followers and had an outline for a how-to-play Settlers of Catan

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,160
tutorial for my second channel.

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,660
But the script kept growing and growing and began to look more like a documentary film

74
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,600
on board game design than a YouTube video which might, depending on who you are, sound

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,480
really interesting but it had the boring problem I mentioned before.

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,640
My last-ditch effort to save a project like this is to get rid of everything, work on

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,840
something else for a little while and then write a brand new script by hand which I did.

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,280
But that script still wasn't good and weeks after starting the project I had to shelve

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
it.

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,400
But I'm still talking about it because it's an idea that I just can't let go and might

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,040
come back to someday.

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,220
Why don't you hire people to help you?

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,200
That's a big topic that deserves its own video but for now let me just say the kind of work

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,440
produced by individuals is very different than the kind of work produced by groups.

85
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,400
One isn't intrinsically better than the other but I think the kinds of videos I've made

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,120
have all benefited from being a one-man project from start to finish.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,280
Your opinion on koalas.

88
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,240
They sleep 20 hours a day, never going to be a koala-based civilization with that kind

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
of work ethic.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,760
If you could transfer your brain into a robotic body, would you?

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,000
Obviously yes.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,280
You can add three amendments to the US Constitution.

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
What do they do?

94
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,880
Oh, so many tempting changes to make.

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,680
Off the top of my head I'd say, first, abolish private funding of all elections and instead

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,840
make them run from a limited pool of tax money, second, abolish the Senate and replace it

97
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,800
with some kind of proportional body, and third, overturn the interstate commerce clause

98
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
which basically gives the federal government a little too much power over the affairs of

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
the states.

100
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,640
Of course, if it was actually my responsibility to change three things, I'd consult with some

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,120
experts rather than just idly mull it over for a couple days.

102
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,240
What advice would you give for a successful life?

103
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Build a self-evaluation loop into your life.

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,560
If you don't periodically review your actions and how they've turned out and your decision-making

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,400
process then there's no hope for your life to improve other than just by random chance.

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,600
I do very small weekly reviews and bigger quarterly and yearly reviews of how my life

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,760
is going and how I might want it to be different in both the biggest and smallest ways and

108
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,600
what actions I need to take to try and achieve that.

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,540
That's the best high-level advice I have.

110
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,560
For more tactical advice I recommend two books, one that changed my life, Getting Things Done

111
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
by David Allen, and another that might change yours, So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Newport.

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,120
You can click these books to read my reviews of them.

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Have you made a video you didn't like how it came out?

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,680
With the possible exception of the 2012 and Holland videos, I'm unhappy with all of them.

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't watch my videos after upload if I can possibly avoid it.

117
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,200
To me, each is a graveyard of the could-have-been.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,240
Favorite non-educational YouTube channels?

119
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,960
First, Glove and Boots, who I'm surprised haven't yet gotten all the subscribers, and

120
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,760
second, I'm a huge fan of Yahtzee, the Roger Ebert of video game reviews.

121
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,600
What was your first memory of the internet?

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,320
Mine is playing Flash games.

123
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Mine is BBSs.

124
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Now get off my lawn and go watch this documentary, you whippersnapper.

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Who are your heroes?

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,360
Mostly Dark Seer and Necrolite.

127
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,120
What do you find hardest when making a video?

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,480
Writing the script is the hardest and it's unfortunately the bottleneck for the whole

129
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
process.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,160
The most uncomfortable part is editing the audio.

131
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,880
Just like everyone else, there's a voice in my head that I like and a voice on the tape

132
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
that I don't.

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,200
Have any of your answers from the previous Q&A changed?

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,760
You're probably referring to these and no.

135
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,840
How long would you survive a zombie apocalypse?

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
I wouldn't.

137
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,000
The Walking Dead-style zombie apocalypse arises, the correct course of action is clearly suicide.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,740
What do you listen to while making videos?

139
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,720
My most reliable writing music is Girl Talks All Day, which I would link to on YouTube

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
but it's copyright infringement-tastic.

141
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,680
You can get it from his website and if you like remixes, you should give it a listen.

142
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,640
However, I often get some random terrible song in my head while writing and end up buying

143
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,500
it and putting it on repeat for hours.

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,020
For this script, my iTunes reveals I listen to a single song 127 times and while that

145
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,180
might be torture in some jurisdictions, the repetitiveness really zones me into writing.

146
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,460
Animating, however, is incredibly tedious so I listen to a ton of audiobooks and podcasts

147
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
to keep my sanity.

148
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,180
What's the most interesting could-have-been of history?

149
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,420
Historical could-have-beens mostly strike me as a missing-the-point thought exercise.

150
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,420
The real driver of history is neither great men nor the actions of the masses but the

151
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,700
ceaseless march of science and technology which is mostly indifferent to the imaginary

152
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,740
lines drawn by packs of monkeys.

153
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,300
Knowing my perspective, you'll see why if I had to pick one, it would be this primitive

154
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,340
Greek steam engine invented 2,000 years ago.

155
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,900
There are reasons why it wasn't developed further but if some rich Greek had gotten

156
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,780
obsessed with the technology, perhaps we would have had an industrial revolution two millennia

157
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,580
earlier and we'd now be a transgalactic post-singularity civilization with robot bodies.

158
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,540
What's the most British thing you've encountered that you can't get your head around?

159
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,340
The idea that the best way to cool down on a hot summer day while confined to a non-air-conditioned

160
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,780
office is to drink hot tea.

161
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Madness.

162
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,540
Absolute madness.

163
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,260
Should we create a universal language?

164
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,780
We already have, it's just not very universal.

165
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,820
What question do you want me to ask the most?

166
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Hmm.

167
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,500
I love your videos and have even watched this somewhat tedious one until the very end.

168
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,860
How can I help support you?

169
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm glad you asked, Gregorianhawk.

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,180
The best way is through a subscription at Subbable where you can get signed posters

171
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,360
and other stuff and there's also t-shirts and addiction mugs and flamethrowers over

172
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
at DFTBA.

173
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Well, Internet, it's been fun and I'm sorry if your question didn't make it into this

174
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,080
video there were loads I had to cut but now that we're in this realm of numbers so big

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,580
they don't make sense, perhaps I'll turn Q&As into an occasional random thing rather than

176
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,600
a waiting for an arbitrary base 10 rollover thing.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,520
Thank you again to everyone for your continued support and thank you for subscribing and

178
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
watching.

179
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
The last two years have been quite a ride.
