00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
Hello, internet.

00:02.080 --> 00:04.800
So I think this is the part where I'm supposed to have a dramatic opening.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.840
Perhaps the 2001 theme song playing in the background as the number one million slowly

00:08.840 --> 00:12.920
fades into view, but obviously that's not happening.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.880
Don't get me wrong, I'm lucky that so many people want to watch my videos, it's just

00:15.880 --> 00:20.840
that one million subscribers is a number too large to be comprehended with a monkey-derived

00:20.840 --> 00:21.840
brain.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.440
To try and have it feel more real, I've taken some YouTube data and made a spreadsheet.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.480
You can select your country and enter the population of the city where you live and

00:28.480 --> 00:32.680
it will spit out the statistically approximate number of people in that city who are subscribed

00:32.680 --> 00:33.680
to this channel.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.800
Doing that for London shows there are about 9,000 people in the city who are subscribers.

00:37.800 --> 00:42.800
Now, 9,000 is obviously a smaller number than one million, but it's a number with constraints

00:42.800 --> 00:48.960
and is small enough to be partially understood while still large enough to be very intimidating.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.600
If you're interested, you can click here to play around with the spreadsheet.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.000
Now, as promised, on to the Q&A.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.640
What do you like most about being a YouTuber?

00:55.640 --> 00:59.000
The best thing about this strange new world is the people I've met, which is quite the

00:59.000 --> 01:01.180
statement for a social recluse to make.

01:01.180 --> 01:05.040
All these guys are amazing to talk with and I feel very lucky that I get the occasional

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
chance to do so.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.120
What's the biggest change of opinion you've had?

01:08.120 --> 01:11.920
That's a little too personal to share with, say, one million people, but I do want to

01:11.920 --> 01:15.020
talk about the importance of being able to change your mind in general.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.880
The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.520
They are objects in a box you carry with you and should be easily replaceable if it turns

01:22.520 --> 01:23.680
out they're no good.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.720
If you think that the opinions in the box are who you are, then you'll cling to them

01:26.720 --> 01:28.720
despite any evidence to the contrary.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.440
Bottom line, if you want to always be right, you need to always be prepared to change your

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
mind.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.840
Were you trying to create a unique aesthetic by using stick figures?

01:35.840 --> 01:37.800
No, it's just that I can't draw.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.780
After moving to London, how long did it take until you stopped saying math and started

01:40.780 --> 01:41.780
saying maths?

01:41.780 --> 01:42.780
I haven't.

01:42.780 --> 01:43.780
I'm sticking with math.

01:43.780 --> 01:47.060
Americans in the UK often end up with an unfortunate accent I call pseudo-British.

01:47.060 --> 01:51.320
I try very hard to avoid this, but when you've spent the majority of your talking time with

01:51.320 --> 01:55.800
British people over a decade, it's impossible to completely fight the creeping pseudo-British

01:55.800 --> 01:58.560
accent no matter how abhorrent you think it makes you sound.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.440
Did your students know about your YouTube channel?

02:00.440 --> 02:02.920
I would never talk about it, but I know some of them knew.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.680
However, it's impossible to express how little they cared.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.000
My classes were not like hour-long CGP Grey videos.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.400
Would you like to see the interrobang more widely adopted?

02:11.400 --> 02:12.400
Who wouldn't?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.680
Why don't you have an upload schedule?

02:13.680 --> 02:17.640
Right, the big question, usually phrased in the YouTube comment section as, why you no

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640
make more vids.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.760
So on average, over the past couple years, I've posted a Grey Explains video about every

02:22.760 --> 02:27.920
five weeks, which means if I could switch to a weekly schedule, my income would quintuple.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.020
Trust me, I would if I could.

02:30.020 --> 02:33.180
I've talked before about how long it takes to make these videos, but one of the other

02:33.180 --> 02:36.640
problems I haven't mentioned is the failure rate of projects.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.260
For every video you see, there's at least three or four that didn't make it.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.840
Most of the time, that's just a lost afternoon working on an idea before realizing it's a

02:43.840 --> 02:47.800
dud, but sometimes it's weeks before a fatal flaw reveals itself.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.240
Sometimes I'll discover too late that a central fact of the video isn't correct or sometimes

02:51.240 --> 02:53.920
the whole script is just unfixably boring.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.760
Either way, the decision to kill a video that isn't working is depressing and frustrating

02:57.760 --> 03:00.520
because of the sunk cost of all those hours.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.880
The videos you see are mostly pretty good precisely because I try my best to kill the

03:04.880 --> 03:06.160
ones that weren't.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.720
That's why there isn't a schedule and there never can be.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.160
What's the biggest video you killed?

03:11.160 --> 03:16.120
The most time I ever lost was on a very important video to convince the world why Settlers of

03:16.120 --> 03:18.600
Catan is the greatest board game ever made.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.800
I had a couple thousand words as a starting point, harassed some people for footage of

03:21.800 --> 03:25.560
a now-famous game that took place at YouTube EDU, got a bunch of random videos from my

03:25.560 --> 03:29.220
ever-helpful Twitter followers and had an outline for a how-to-play Settlers of Catan

03:29.220 --> 03:31.160
tutorial for my second channel.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.660
But the script kept growing and growing and began to look more like a documentary film

03:34.660 --> 03:38.600
on board game design than a YouTube video which might, depending on who you are, sound

03:38.600 --> 03:42.480
really interesting but it had the boring problem I mentioned before.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.640
My last-ditch effort to save a project like this is to get rid of everything, work on

03:46.160 --> 03:49.840
something else for a little while and then write a brand new script by hand which I did.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.280
But that script still wasn't good and weeks after starting the project I had to shelve

03:54.280 --> 03:55.280
it.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.400
But I'm still talking about it because it's an idea that I just can't let go and might

03:59.400 --> 04:01.040
come back to someday.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.220
Why don't you hire people to help you?

04:03.220 --> 04:07.200
That's a big topic that deserves its own video but for now let me just say the kind of work

04:07.200 --> 04:11.440
produced by individuals is very different than the kind of work produced by groups.

04:11.440 --> 04:15.400
One isn't intrinsically better than the other but I think the kinds of videos I've made

04:16.160 --> 04:19.120
have all benefited from being a one-man project from start to finish.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.280
Your opinion on koalas.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.240
They sleep 20 hours a day, never going to be a koala-based civilization with that kind

04:24.240 --> 04:25.240
of work ethic.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.760
If you could transfer your brain into a robotic body, would you?

04:27.760 --> 04:29.000
Obviously yes.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.280
You can add three amendments to the US Constitution.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
What do they do?

04:32.280 --> 04:34.880
Oh, so many tempting changes to make.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.680
Off the top of my head I'd say, first, abolish private funding of all elections and instead

04:38.680 --> 04:42.840
make them run from a limited pool of tax money, second, abolish the Senate and replace it

04:42.840 --> 04:46.800
with some kind of proportional body, and third, overturn the interstate commerce clause

04:46.800 --> 04:50.560
which basically gives the federal government a little too much power over the affairs of

04:50.560 --> 04:51.560
the states.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.640
Of course, if it was actually my responsibility to change three things, I'd consult with some

04:55.640 --> 04:59.120
experts rather than just idly mull it over for a couple days.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.240
What advice would you give for a successful life?

05:01.240 --> 05:03.920
Build a self-evaluation loop into your life.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.560
If you don't periodically review your actions and how they've turned out and your decision-making

05:08.560 --> 05:13.400
process then there's no hope for your life to improve other than just by random chance.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.600
I do very small weekly reviews and bigger quarterly and yearly reviews of how my life

05:17.600 --> 05:21.760
is going and how I might want it to be different in both the biggest and smallest ways and

05:21.760 --> 05:24.600
what actions I need to take to try and achieve that.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.540
That's the best high-level advice I have.

05:26.540 --> 05:30.560
For more tactical advice I recommend two books, one that changed my life, Getting Things Done

05:30.560 --> 05:34.720
by David Allen, and another that might change yours, So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
Newport.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.120
You can click these books to read my reviews of them.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.240
Have you made a video you didn't like how it came out?

05:40.240 --> 05:44.680
With the possible exception of the 2012 and Holland videos, I'm unhappy with all of them.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.320
I don't watch my videos after upload if I can possibly avoid it.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.200
To me, each is a graveyard of the could-have-been.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.240
Favorite non-educational YouTube channels?

05:53.240 --> 05:56.960
First, Glove and Boots, who I'm surprised haven't yet gotten all the subscribers, and

05:56.960 --> 06:01.760
second, I'm a huge fan of Yahtzee, the Roger Ebert of video game reviews.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.600
What was your first memory of the internet?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.320
Mine is playing Flash games.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
Mine is BBSs.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.680
Now get off my lawn and go watch this documentary, you whippersnapper.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.880
Who are your heroes?

06:10.880 --> 06:12.360
Mostly Dark Seer and Necrolite.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.120
What do you find hardest when making a video?

06:14.120 --> 06:17.480
Writing the script is the hardest and it's unfortunately the bottleneck for the whole

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
process.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.160
The most uncomfortable part is editing the audio.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.880
Just like everyone else, there's a voice in my head that I like and a voice on the tape

06:24.880 --> 06:25.920
that I don't.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.200
Have any of your answers from the previous Q&A changed?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.760
You're probably referring to these and no.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.840
How long would you survive a zombie apocalypse?

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
I wouldn't.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.000
The Walking Dead-style zombie apocalypse arises, the correct course of action is clearly suicide.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.740
What do you listen to while making videos?

06:40.740 --> 06:44.720
My most reliable writing music is Girl Talks All Day, which I would link to on YouTube

06:44.720 --> 06:47.120
but it's copyright infringement-tastic.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.680
You can get it from his website and if you like remixes, you should give it a listen.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.640
However, I often get some random terrible song in my head while writing and end up buying

06:54.640 --> 06:57.500
it and putting it on repeat for hours.

06:57.500 --> 07:03.020
For this script, my iTunes reveals I listen to a single song 127 times and while that

07:03.020 --> 07:07.180
might be torture in some jurisdictions, the repetitiveness really zones me into writing.

07:07.180 --> 07:12.460
Animating, however, is incredibly tedious so I listen to a ton of audiobooks and podcasts

07:12.460 --> 07:13.460
to keep my sanity.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.180
What's the most interesting could-have-been of history?

07:16.180 --> 07:19.420
Historical could-have-beens mostly strike me as a missing-the-point thought exercise.

07:19.420 --> 07:23.420
The real driver of history is neither great men nor the actions of the masses but the

07:23.420 --> 07:27.700
ceaseless march of science and technology which is mostly indifferent to the imaginary

07:27.700 --> 07:29.740
lines drawn by packs of monkeys.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.300
Knowing my perspective, you'll see why if I had to pick one, it would be this primitive

07:33.300 --> 07:36.340
Greek steam engine invented 2,000 years ago.

07:36.340 --> 07:39.900
There are reasons why it wasn't developed further but if some rich Greek had gotten

07:39.900 --> 07:43.780
obsessed with the technology, perhaps we would have had an industrial revolution two millennia

07:43.780 --> 07:48.580
earlier and we'd now be a transgalactic post-singularity civilization with robot bodies.

07:48.580 --> 07:51.540
What's the most British thing you've encountered that you can't get your head around?

07:51.540 --> 07:56.340
The idea that the best way to cool down on a hot summer day while confined to a non-air-conditioned

07:56.340 --> 07:58.780
office is to drink hot tea.

07:58.780 --> 07:59.780
Madness.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.540
Absolute madness.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.260
Should we create a universal language?

08:03.260 --> 08:05.780
We already have, it's just not very universal.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.820
What question do you want me to ask the most?

08:07.820 --> 08:08.820
Hmm.

08:08.820 --> 08:12.500
I love your videos and have even watched this somewhat tedious one until the very end.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.860
How can I help support you?

08:13.860 --> 08:15.680
I'm glad you asked, Gregorianhawk.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.180
The best way is through a subscription at Subbable where you can get signed posters

08:19.180 --> 08:23.360
and other stuff and there's also t-shirts and addiction mugs and flamethrowers over

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
at DFTBA.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.400
Well, Internet, it's been fun and I'm sorry if your question didn't make it into this

08:28.400 --> 08:33.080
video there were loads I had to cut but now that we're in this realm of numbers so big

08:33.080 --> 08:37.580
they don't make sense, perhaps I'll turn Q&As into an occasional random thing rather than

08:37.580 --> 08:40.600
a waiting for an arbitrary base 10 rollover thing.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.520
Thank you again to everyone for your continued support and thank you for subscribing and

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
watching.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.520
The last two years have been quite a ride.
