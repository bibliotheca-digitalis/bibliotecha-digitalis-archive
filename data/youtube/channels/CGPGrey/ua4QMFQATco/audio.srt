1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
As Mark Twain once quipped,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,240
If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
There's a pair of videos on my channel that were in the works for over a year.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
The Ticoi videos.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,600
One exploration and one explanation.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
And while the exploration video is fine,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,440
I made a catastrophic error in the explanation video.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,120
I've re-uploaded a corrected version,

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,160
and I've also made this video to show you some of the behind the scenes of how those videos got made,

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,080
how the error got in, and how the decision to re-upload came to be.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,440
But I've written this video in as little time as possible

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,080
to correct the error as fast as possible.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,360
So be warned.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,560
It's a long letter.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,160
The story of Ticoi starts with past Grey traveling to Indian reservations for an other project.

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,720
During that wandering, I came across the Skull Valley Indian Reservation out in Utah,

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,360
and within its borders, the Ticoi Test Range.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,160
Information about which was limited and scattered.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
I got the impression it was an abandoned military weapons facility.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,320
Which, come on.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Three more intriguing adjectives.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
You could not precede a noun.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,200
At this point on YouTube, I'd played around with making a few vlog-style videos,

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,120
and while working on the bigger project,

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,600
I thought Ticoi could be a little shard to examine to make into an easy and quick vlog,

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
exploring the place and explaining what it was.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,240
And the tribal government graciously granted me permission to go on site and film.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,880
Which, as a side note, please do not try to visit Ticoi.

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,080
It is private property.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,720
Not open to the public and super dangerous.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,360
In retrospect, I was shockingly stupid to explore it in as unprepared fashion as I did.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,080
But I went, I filmed, I didn't fall in a hole and die,

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,640
or catch histoplasmosis from the bat droppings everywhere,

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
and I didn't get attacked by the quote,

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,360
really mean owl.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
I was warned, defended, warehouse number.

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh, I forgot to write it down.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
Seriously, I could not have been a worse urbex noob,

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,160
but the celestial dice rolled in my favor that day,

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,960
and I got back to my hotel with some amazing video.

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,760
Now all I needed to do was explain this beautiful shard.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
Of course, joke was on me,

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
because every topic is an entire world unto itself once you start looking,

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
and months later, the one video split into two,

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,400
and I was barely closer to a coherent explanation of Ticoi than at the start.

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Okay, pause here,

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,720
and let me tell you a little bit about the video production process in general.

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,960
Videos get started either through wandering the real world or the forest of all knowledge,

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,040
seeing an interesting area, exploring it,

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,080
and, if lucky, some part will look like it could be a video.

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
I've come to accept that I am a slow writer,

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,600
so it's best to hold off the first serious draft until long into the exploration phase,

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
often long enough that by the time I get to the

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
okay, seriously, sit down and write this thing,

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
I've forgotten a lot of what I've read,

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
but that's actually a useful way to filter for the interesting and important and frequent ideas

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
in a topic before the many, many rounds of revisions and checks to come.

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,520
I used to make my videos all alone,

59
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,600
but over the years I've gathered a small team,

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
and at some point, if I can get the script into a readable-ish version,

61
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,640
it's time to let the team know what the next project might be.

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
And there is celebration or dread at what will be

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,400
at least many weeks of their lives spent on this thing.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,520
Everyone has a specialty, animation, research, logistics, music,

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,280
sometimes custom artwork or audio,

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,160
and everyone provides useful feedback on the topic,

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,200
sometimes having personal experience or finding further details

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
or hunting down related lost artifacts.

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
For me, there's also a lot of double-checking at this point,

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
going back to notes I made during exploration time

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
or looking into an out-of-place seeming fact.

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,600
The script eventually progresses from merely readable

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
into what is nearing a final-ish form,

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,160
and this is where it's sent out to experts.

75
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Now, this phase seems like it should be the easiest.

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,480
A teacher checks your homework,

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
but often it's quite troublesome.

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,240
The first problem is finding an expert.

79
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,040
If a video ends up being largely a book or paper adaptation and the author is alive,

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,240
then that's pretty easy,

81
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,720
and those projects are generally more straightforward.

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,320
But for a lot of videos, figuring out who is the expert on this thing isn't always clear,

83
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,880
and for some topics, there simply isn't anyone.

84
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
For others, experts may exist,

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
but finding them is basically impossible

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
because there isn't a good public record of their expertise.

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
This last is particularly frustrating

88
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,840
because the instant the final video goes up,

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,360
all the unfindable experts will find it and get in touch.

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Now, in theory, this problem could be solved

91
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
by publicly announcing what the active topics are,

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
and back when Past Gray's channel was smaller and he younger and naiver,

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
that's totally a thing he did.

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
But Current Gray in current year has seen shockingly blatant cases

95
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,560
of those who work fast scooping topics from those who work slow.

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
It's not the early days of the internet anymore,

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,240
and surviving while supporting a team means you must compete

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
with the entire entertainment industry in all its forms.

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
So some secrecy is necessary,

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
even though, yes, I'm fully aware I've already developed

101
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
what I'm working on in this very video and I will do it again later,

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
but I've made an exception,

103
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,240
even though I know from experience I've never not regretted talking about work in progress.

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
Even if the topic is unscooped or unscoopable,

105
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,080
I just find projects harder to finish once they're out in the open

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
and everyone is watching.

107
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
Back to the experts.

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
If they exist and we find them and they're willing to help out

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
and they're willing to keep a secret for possibly months,

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,960
then that's great.

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
But it can still be tricky.

112
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
For example, which experts?

113
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
Just about any academic topic will have experts

114
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
who have spent their entire lives thinking about this one area

115
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
and who also violently disagree with each other.

116
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,040
Which can leave you, the non-expert,

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,400
to wander dangerously close to the what-is-true dimension,

118
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
which, if you're not careful,

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
will suck you into an unproductive downward spiral of

120
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,720
how do we know anything is true?

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
This happens to me at least once a month

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
and is a topic which is way beyond the scope of this video,

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
maybe a story for another time.

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,080
Ugh, don't say that!

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,760
Okay, skipping the existential crisis,

126
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,600
the script is sent out to experts for checking

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
and then the final draft can be recorded

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
and turned into a video for you to watch.

129
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
That's how it works in general.

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
Now let's resume the story of Ticoi skipping ahead to...

131
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,120
Upload Day!

132
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
A day that is simultaneously the joyous completion

133
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
of hundreds of hours of teamwork

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
and the solitude of stomach churning

135
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,760
as you wait to find out if you have been wrong on the internet.

136
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,560
And there are many ways to be wrong on the internet,

137
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
which we will visit later.

138
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,640
But the process is designed to be able to avoid errors

139
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,080
while still being able to publish something eventually.

140
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
And in this process,

141
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,680
I had learned that my initial impression wasn't quite right.

142
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
Rather, Ticoi was a tiny part of an enormous for-profit company

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
that used Ticoi as a static firing test range for rocket motors.

144
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,560
Motors that just so happened to be used in nuclear missiles,

145
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
including the famous Minuteman.

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,880
But there's often so much more left on the cutting room floor,

147
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
so a new part of the process is doing a director's commentary

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
for crowdfunders with all the extra bits,

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
after I've waited a couple of hours to ensure

150
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,680
there's no Upload Day disaster that needs immediate attention.

151
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,160
The internet will tell you real fast if you're wrong,

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
but on Ticoi Upload Day, the stomach-churning lessened as nothing came in,

153
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
I went and streamed the commentary in a pretty relieved mood,

154
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
as this has become a nice psychological marker for me

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,640
that a project is truly and completely finally finished.

156
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,320
Doing the commentary kept me up late,

157
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
but satisfied with a long day's work,

158
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,720
I decided right before trying to sleep,

159
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
let me check the comments one more time.

160
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
And that is when I found this.

161
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
The maximum possible stomach-churning comment.

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,800
Asking the audience to imagine what it would be like

163
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
to do this whole video with the Minuteman missile,

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
but in the video itself is the evidence that it wasn't the Minuteman missile.

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,920
It was the Trident missile.

166
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Oh no.

167
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,920
I didn't have to imagine what it was like to do this video.

168
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,880
I was the guy who did this video.

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Not good.

170
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,960
At the time I read this comment,

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
basically seconds away from total collapse,

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I was in no condition to address it.

173
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
But let's just say I didn't sleep well that night,

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,320
and will skip the depressive, self-destructive, self-doubting part

175
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,560
and jump back to where, with a rebooted brain,

176
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
I was able to confirm that yes,

177
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,320
HODIS-8 was right and I was wrong.

178
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,040
Ticoi did not test Minuteman missile motors.

179
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Ticoi tested tridents.

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
I even found a poster of one in the exploration video itself.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
I can't see anything down that corridor.

182
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,560
Alright, strategic pride.

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,600
You may be wondering how I could have spent so long on this topic

184
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,320
and yet missed the answer to the most fundamental question,

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,680
the literal video title.

186
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
What was Ticoi?

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, me too.

188
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,760
So we conducted an autopsy.

189
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,280
Oh god, this is only halfway through.

190
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,400
It really is a long letter.

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
Okay, because there was so little available information about Ticoi,

192
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
in that pre-script early exploration phase,

193
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
I ended up reading a lot about the Cold War in general,

194
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
which was interesting, unlike most history,

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
but was more than a little infuriating,

196
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
because all the areas right around Ticoi,

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
the Magna Manufacturing Plant,

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,040
the Wendover Airfield,

199
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,400
the Utah Test and Training Range,

200
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,520
the Dugway Proving Ground,

201
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,640
all kept popping up,

202
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
but never coy Ticoi herself.

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
And this is where some mind-muddling began to occur,

204
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,880
because while I learned the United States Cold War nuclear deterrence forces

205
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720
had three branches, land, sea and air,

206
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,920
most of what I read talked a lot about the ground-based Minuteman missiles,

207
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,440
less so about nuclear bombers and very little about the nuclear subs.

208
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
So in my mind, the Minutemen became the real stars of the Cold War,

209
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
which played into the later era.

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
I did eventually find this book about the history

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
of the Hercules Powder Company that built Ticoi.

212
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
And while the book contains more information

213
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,960
about a now non-existent chemical manufacturing company

214
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,880
than most people could reasonably want to know,

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,200
it does not in its 433 pages mention Ticoi even once.

216
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,920
Either because in comparison to the breathtakingly large

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,280
international scope of the company,

218
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,080
Ticoi was just too small to warrant even a passing mention,

219
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
or because the work at Ticoi was classified.

220
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Or both.

221
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
But I was still determined to make a video about this place

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
I had become more than a little obsessed with

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
and was now a connection point to future topics in the grayverse.

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
So with what I did have, I went through the process

225
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
and it is somewhere in the earliest drafts

226
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,800
I wrote down Ticoi tested Minuteman Missile Motors.

227
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
That is wrong, but I didn't realize.

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,720
And it didn't occur to me to double check

229
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
because at this stage, the script was still filled with

230
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,880
show-stopping holes in need of dire attention

231
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,360
before the video had a hope of getting published.

232
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Holes like, what are these things for?

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Why is this building on rails?

234
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
How did all this work?

235
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Now, finding an expert who could discuss the classified details

236
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
of a site involved in nuclear weapons production proved impossible.

237
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
While there are people who are experts,

238
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
and though Ticoi was abandoned for decades,

239
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
the United States government still takes her secrets pretty seriously.

240
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
Fun fact, some of the information, uh, revealed

241
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,480
required legal consultation to determine if it could be

242
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,920
publicly discussed without, you know, going to prison.

243
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,080
It was looking pretty bad for the project,

244
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,560
but I did get one confidential military expert

245
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,080
who worked at sites like Ticoi to review an early draft of the video

246
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,280
and who explained how sites like this worked and filled in the holes.

247
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,920
But they hadn't worked at Ticoi itself.

248
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,960
Thus had no reason to know or comment on Ticoi

249
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,200
being part of the sea-based arm of nuclear deterrence, not ground.

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
So in the script, this error had no expert to catch it,

251
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,920
but also I didn't catch it.

252
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,200
And in the autopsy, it's clear I had not one, not two,

253
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,840
but three missed chances to catch the error.

254
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
First, this test facility footage.

255
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,080
This will be the firing of D5 second stage, pet 5B250.

256
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,560
The D5 spoken refers to the D5 motor

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
of the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missile.

258
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
I did wonder what D5 pet 5B250 meant,

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
but I assumed it was a serial number or other code.

260
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,960
Typing any version of the spoken words into Google

261
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,400
would have been less than enlightening,

262
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,760
but typing D5 missile would have brought me right to it.

263
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,080
Second, the list of inspectable sites for start.

264
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,680
I had been reading about the US-USSR negotiations and inspection sites,

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,400
but never saw an exact list until I pulled this one

266
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,480
from the Federation of American Scientists.

267
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,400
Here, I did notice that Ticoi was under the SLBM header, not the ICBM header,

268
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,080
but I didn't investigate because, at this point, the video was in final animation

269
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,520
and I was trying to wrap things up, not wander off the path again.

270
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,280
Deciding when to stop tracking down every little thing is a vital skill,

271
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,360
if you, say, ever want to finish a project.

272
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
And if you go watch the director's commentary,

273
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,400
you can listen to poor innocent Grey, who doesn't know what's coming,

274
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
discuss that point several times.

275
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,720
But this time, all I had do was but lift my reluctant eyes to the top of the page

276
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
and there behold my answer.

277
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,520
SLBM.

278
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,680
Submarine-launched ballistic missile.

279
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
How embarrassing.

280
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
But it gets one worse.

281
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
Missed chance three, the timeline.

282
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,560
Over the years, one of the most effective tools I've found

283
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,080
to disentangle a complicated subject is the humble timeline.

284
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,920
Sources you discover in a random order, and books often discuss topics out of order,

285
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
so it's clarifying to just write out a list of what happened when.

286
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
And this often highlights bad or contradictory sources.

287
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
This is where I unambiguously failed the hardest.

288
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,360
To simplify, I've been calling the Minuteman missile the Minuteman missile,

289
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,480
but there's actually three.

290
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,280
One, two, three.

291
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,760
First deployed in 62, 65, and 70.

292
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,960
The United States ordered 1,000 to be built,

293
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,680
and I don't know how long it took to fill that order.

294
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,160
Most sources gave a vague the 70s,

295
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
but maddeningly, in doing another round of investigating for this video,

296
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,880
we found government sources ranging from 1977 to 1963.

297
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,360
What the deal is with that, I have no idea.

298
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
I have to stop investigating now,

299
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,840
otherwise this correction video, you're hopefully still watching,

300
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,280
will never get published.

301
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,960
But this is exactly how a timeline can show you something's up.

302
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,000
And Past Gray should have known better than to just accept a vague

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
the 70s for the full 1,000 Minuteman deployment.

304
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
That sort of phrase is a yellow flag in general,

305
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,920
but even if that means the later half of the decade,

306
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,880
T-Coy was, probably, built in 1976,

307
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,920
which is a tight timeline to have tested the Minuteman.

308
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
This is 100% my fault.

309
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
I should have caught this way early in the process,

310
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
but I just didn't.

311
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
Which, well, is why we're all here.

312
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,520
Okay, so big deal.

313
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,480
You got the wrong missile.

314
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,640
Why not just fix the video and replace it?

315
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,320
A good question that drags us down into the detailed bowels of how YouTube works.

316
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
YouTube does not let creators replace videos with new versions.

317
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
You have to upload a whole new video,

318
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,920
which risks annoying literally millions of people with redundant notifications,

319
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
should YouTube choose to send them,

320
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,080
and tempts the YouTube gods to look unfavorably upon your channel,

321
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,760
because that last video had terrible engagement.

322
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,160
While I will publicly and loudly complain that YouTube won't let creators replace videos,

323
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,840
I'm also secretly grateful for this,

324
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,960
because it forces a definitive end to projects,

325
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,560
without which my channel would doubtless have but a single video still.

326
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,080
The difference between the United Kingdom, Great Britain, and England explained,

327
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,080
which I would have spent the last 10 years tweaking, revising, expanding, fixing,

328
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,440
and fixing again as the fixes introduced new things to be fixed.

329
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,080
Oh, and updating as the facts themselves changed.

330
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,400
So I can't believe YouTube won't let me replace a video with an updated version.

331
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
But also, please don't ever let me YouTube,

332
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,400
I only have a career because you forced me to move on.

333
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,320
Now there is additionally a general opportunity cost of going backward,

334
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,000
instead of making something new, separate from the specifics of YouTube.

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,640
So how to decide in general when the mountain of backwards cost is worth ascending?

336
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,160
To discuss, let's visit The Menagerie of Mistakes.

337
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,880
For example, in the video about Northern Ireland's lack of flag, Scotland has three arms.

338
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,160
This is a glitch.

339
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
Glitches are harmless if annoying creatures.

340
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,160
Well, annoying to creators.

341
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
For audiences, they are fun and easy to catch,

342
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,400
which is why within seconds of posting a video,

343
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,880
Scotland has three arms will be the top comment.

344
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,960
Glitches get in because for the creator,

345
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,680
glitches are really good at hiding in plain sight,

346
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
surviving revision after revision.

347
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,400
And if you do spot them and try to fix them in a rush,

348
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,560
you often just cause their multiplication.

349
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
It's best to realize glitches will always be with you,

350
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,760
and accept their companionship as part of the process.

351
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
Next over, we have blunders.

352
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,200
Blunders make you look like a fool, but still in a mostly harmless way.

353
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,360
I've only ever once before re-uploaded a video,

354
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,080
and it was Holland vs The Netherlands because of a blunder

355
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,520
everyone caught minutes after publication and I couldn't live with.

356
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,240
Swapped flags of France and The Netherlands at one spot.

357
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
That's wrong and embarrassing, but had it not been caught instantly,

358
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
I probably would have had to learn to leave it be,

359
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,520
in the same way I blundered this name, pronouncing it Currico,

360
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,600
demonstrating exactly how familiar I was with the place or the alcohol.

361
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,080
When you're feeling amazing about a thing that you've made,

362
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,280
it really tempts delighting a blunder to steal your thunder.

363
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,480
Next are errors.

364
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,200
Ugly, charmless things without redeeming value that come in many different species,

365
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,600
from error trivialis, bad takeus, technically correctus, error factualis, and many, many others.

366
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
Their variety make it impossible to talk about management in general,

367
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,160
because unlike glitches and blunders, which look the same to everyone,

368
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,320
errors come from the what-is-true dimension,

369
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,200
which means different humans will perceive their size and importance and species in different ways,

370
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,760
or disagree about if there's an error at all.

371
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,240
But if you make things, there will be errors,

372
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,880
and post-publication, deciding what to do about them

373
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,240
will have to take into account the size and species you perceive,

374
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
and the cost of extracting its disgusting tentacles from what you have made,

375
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,920
versus the benefits of accepting that you can't always get them all

376
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,840
and moving onward to make a new thing.

377
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,120
But when errors grow large enough, they become a new subspecies.

378
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
The error catastrophicus.

379
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,200
An error that fundamentally breaks at least part of what you have made,

380
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,440
and in making a straight factual video called What is Ticoi,

381
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,760
a video that was, at the time of publication,

382
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,320
the only generally accessible summary of information about this location,

383
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,600
getting which type of missile they tested wrong is a catastrophic factual error.

384
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,760
Which is why I decided to fix it.

385
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,960
Part four.

386
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,400
There were no other parts.

387
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,760
But this is finally the end.

388
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
My dad always said to me,

389
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,080
the cost of perfection is infinite.

390
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,600
And he was totally right.

391
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,480
I can't promise perfection, but post-autopsy,

392
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,720
me and the team are not only working on future videos with this experience in mind,

393
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,520
but also working on the process that makes the videos,

394
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,720
and if we need to make that process longer to bring videos closer to perfection, we will.

395
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
Without a doubt, future me will watch this video

396
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
and wonder why oh why did past Grey have so many words in this script

397
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
to convey the simple message,

398
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,080
I was wrong.

399
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
I apologize.

400
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,320
I fixed it.

401
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,720
But future Grey isn't current Grey,

402
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
and as Pascal famously quipped,

403
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,160
If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.

404
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,240
The old Ticoi video is now unlisted if you're curious to see what's changed.

405
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,120
The director's commentary is public now as a sort of historical curiosity, I guess.

406
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
And the new version of What is Ticoi is here for you to watch.

407
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,560
I hope you like it, again, and thank you for making it to the end.
