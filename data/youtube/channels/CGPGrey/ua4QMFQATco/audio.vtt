00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
As Mark Twain once quipped,

00:01.520 --> 00:04.240
If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.

00:04.240 --> 00:08.000
There's a pair of videos on my channel that were in the works for over a year.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.200
The Ticoi videos.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.600
One exploration and one explanation.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.000
And while the exploration video is fine,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.440
I made a catastrophic error in the explanation video.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.120
I've re-uploaded a corrected version,

00:19.120 --> 00:24.160
and I've also made this video to show you some of the behind the scenes of how those videos got made,

00:24.160 --> 00:28.080
how the error got in, and how the decision to re-upload came to be.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.440
But I've written this video in as little time as possible

00:31.440 --> 00:34.080
to correct the error as fast as possible.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.360
So be warned.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.560
It's a long letter.

00:36.560 --> 00:42.160
The story of Ticoi starts with past Grey traveling to Indian reservations for an other project.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.720
During that wandering, I came across the Skull Valley Indian Reservation out in Utah,

00:46.720 --> 00:49.360
and within its borders, the Ticoi Test Range.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.160
Information about which was limited and scattered.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.600
I got the impression it was an abandoned military weapons facility.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.320
Which, come on.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.920
Three more intriguing adjectives.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.520
You could not precede a noun.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.200
At this point on YouTube, I'd played around with making a few vlog-style videos,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.120
and while working on the bigger project,

01:05.120 --> 01:09.600
I thought Ticoi could be a little shard to examine to make into an easy and quick vlog,

01:09.600 --> 01:12.000
exploring the place and explaining what it was.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.240
And the tribal government graciously granted me permission to go on site and film.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.880
Which, as a side note, please do not try to visit Ticoi.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.080
It is private property.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.720
Not open to the public and super dangerous.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.360
In retrospect, I was shockingly stupid to explore it in as unprepared fashion as I did.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.080
But I went, I filmed, I didn't fall in a hole and die,

01:30.080 --> 01:32.640
or catch histoplasmosis from the bat droppings everywhere,

01:32.640 --> 01:34.240
and I didn't get attacked by the quote,

01:34.240 --> 01:35.360
really mean owl.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.520
I was warned, defended, warehouse number.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.280
Oh, I forgot to write it down.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.840
Seriously, I could not have been a worse urbex noob,

01:41.840 --> 01:44.160
but the celestial dice rolled in my favor that day,

01:44.160 --> 01:46.960
and I got back to my hotel with some amazing video.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.760
Now all I needed to do was explain this beautiful shard.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.200
Of course, joke was on me,

01:51.200 --> 01:55.280
because every topic is an entire world unto itself once you start looking,

01:55.280 --> 01:58.000
and months later, the one video split into two,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.400
and I was barely closer to a coherent explanation of Ticoi than at the start.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.360
Okay, pause here,

02:03.360 --> 02:06.720
and let me tell you a little bit about the video production process in general.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.960
Videos get started either through wandering the real world or the forest of all knowledge,

02:10.960 --> 02:13.040
seeing an interesting area, exploring it,

02:13.040 --> 02:16.080
and, if lucky, some part will look like it could be a video.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.480
I've come to accept that I am a slow writer,

02:18.480 --> 02:23.600
so it's best to hold off the first serious draft until long into the exploration phase,

02:23.600 --> 02:26.000
often long enough that by the time I get to the

02:26.000 --> 02:28.480
okay, seriously, sit down and write this thing,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.640
I've forgotten a lot of what I've read,

02:30.640 --> 02:35.680
but that's actually a useful way to filter for the interesting and important and frequent ideas

02:35.680 --> 02:39.760
in a topic before the many, many rounds of revisions and checks to come.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.520
I used to make my videos all alone,

02:41.520 --> 02:43.600
but over the years I've gathered a small team,

02:43.600 --> 02:47.600
and at some point, if I can get the script into a readable-ish version,

02:47.600 --> 02:50.640
it's time to let the team know what the next project might be.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.440
And there is celebration or dread at what will be

02:53.440 --> 02:56.400
at least many weeks of their lives spent on this thing.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.520
Everyone has a specialty, animation, research, logistics, music,

02:59.520 --> 03:01.280
sometimes custom artwork or audio,

03:01.280 --> 03:04.160
and everyone provides useful feedback on the topic,

03:04.160 --> 03:07.200
sometimes having personal experience or finding further details

03:07.200 --> 03:09.360
or hunting down related lost artifacts.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.920
For me, there's also a lot of double-checking at this point,

03:11.920 --> 03:14.560
going back to notes I made during exploration time

03:14.560 --> 03:17.120
or looking into an out-of-place seeming fact.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.600
The script eventually progresses from merely readable

03:19.600 --> 03:22.000
into what is nearing a final-ish form,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.160
and this is where it's sent out to experts.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.960
Now, this phase seems like it should be the easiest.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.480
A teacher checks your homework,

03:28.480 --> 03:30.080
but often it's quite troublesome.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.240
The first problem is finding an expert.

03:32.240 --> 03:37.040
If a video ends up being largely a book or paper adaptation and the author is alive,

03:37.040 --> 03:38.240
then that's pretty easy,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.720
and those projects are generally more straightforward.

03:40.720 --> 03:46.320
But for a lot of videos, figuring out who is the expert on this thing isn't always clear,

03:46.320 --> 03:48.880
and for some topics, there simply isn't anyone.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.560
For others, experts may exist,

03:50.560 --> 03:52.640
but finding them is basically impossible

03:52.640 --> 03:55.680
because there isn't a good public record of their expertise.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.520
This last is particularly frustrating

03:57.520 --> 03:59.840
because the instant the final video goes up,

03:59.840 --> 04:03.360
all the unfindable experts will find it and get in touch.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.360
Now, in theory, this problem could be solved

04:05.360 --> 04:07.840
by publicly announcing what the active topics are,

04:07.840 --> 04:11.760
and back when Past Gray's channel was smaller and he younger and naiver,

04:11.760 --> 04:13.360
that's totally a thing he did.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.880
But Current Gray in current year has seen shockingly blatant cases

04:16.880 --> 04:20.560
of those who work fast scooping topics from those who work slow.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.960
It's not the early days of the internet anymore,

04:22.960 --> 04:26.240
and surviving while supporting a team means you must compete

04:26.240 --> 04:30.160
with the entire entertainment industry in all its forms.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.000
So some secrecy is necessary,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.240
even though, yes, I'm fully aware I've already developed

04:34.240 --> 04:36.880
what I'm working on in this very video and I will do it again later,

04:36.880 --> 04:37.920
but I've made an exception,

04:37.920 --> 04:42.240
even though I know from experience I've never not regretted talking about work in progress.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.120
Even if the topic is unscooped or unscoopable,

04:45.120 --> 04:48.080
I just find projects harder to finish once they're out in the open

04:48.080 --> 04:49.440
and everyone is watching.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.560
Back to the experts.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.600
If they exist and we find them and they're willing to help out

04:53.600 --> 04:56.000
and they're willing to keep a secret for possibly months,

04:56.000 --> 04:56.960
then that's great.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.400
But it can still be tricky.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.080
For example, which experts?

05:00.080 --> 05:02.560
Just about any academic topic will have experts

05:02.560 --> 05:06.160
who have spent their entire lives thinking about this one area

05:06.160 --> 05:09.120
and who also violently disagree with each other.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.040
Which can leave you, the non-expert,

05:11.040 --> 05:14.400
to wander dangerously close to the what-is-true dimension,

05:14.400 --> 05:15.520
which, if you're not careful,

05:15.520 --> 05:18.400
will suck you into an unproductive downward spiral of

05:18.400 --> 05:20.720
how do we know anything is true?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.320
This happens to me at least once a month

05:22.320 --> 05:25.120
and is a topic which is way beyond the scope of this video,

05:25.120 --> 05:26.720
maybe a story for another time.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.080
Ugh, don't say that!

05:28.080 --> 05:29.760
Okay, skipping the existential crisis,

05:29.760 --> 05:31.600
the script is sent out to experts for checking

05:31.600 --> 05:33.440
and then the final draft can be recorded

05:33.440 --> 05:35.520
and turned into a video for you to watch.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.960
That's how it works in general.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.080
Now let's resume the story of Ticoi skipping ahead to...

05:40.080 --> 05:41.120
Upload Day!

05:41.120 --> 05:43.520
A day that is simultaneously the joyous completion

05:43.520 --> 05:44.880
of hundreds of hours of teamwork

05:44.880 --> 05:46.640
and the solitude of stomach churning

05:46.640 --> 05:49.760
as you wait to find out if you have been wrong on the internet.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.560
And there are many ways to be wrong on the internet,

05:52.560 --> 05:53.760
which we will visit later.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.640
But the process is designed to be able to avoid errors

05:56.640 --> 06:00.080
while still being able to publish something eventually.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.040
And in this process,

06:01.040 --> 06:03.680
I had learned that my initial impression wasn't quite right.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.600
Rather, Ticoi was a tiny part of an enormous for-profit company

06:07.600 --> 06:11.520
that used Ticoi as a static firing test range for rocket motors.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.560
Motors that just so happened to be used in nuclear missiles,

06:14.560 --> 06:16.080
including the famous Minuteman.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.880
But there's often so much more left on the cutting room floor,

06:18.880 --> 06:22.080
so a new part of the process is doing a director's commentary

06:22.080 --> 06:24.400
for crowdfunders with all the extra bits,

06:24.400 --> 06:26.320
after I've waited a couple of hours to ensure

06:26.320 --> 06:29.680
there's no Upload Day disaster that needs immediate attention.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.160
The internet will tell you real fast if you're wrong,

06:32.160 --> 06:36.080
but on Ticoi Upload Day, the stomach-churning lessened as nothing came in,

06:36.080 --> 06:38.800
I went and streamed the commentary in a pretty relieved mood,

06:38.800 --> 06:41.360
as this has become a nice psychological marker for me

06:41.360 --> 06:44.640
that a project is truly and completely finally finished.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.320
Doing the commentary kept me up late,

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
but satisfied with a long day's work,

06:48.320 --> 06:50.720
I decided right before trying to sleep,

06:50.720 --> 06:53.360
let me check the comments one more time.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.680
And that is when I found this.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.240
The maximum possible stomach-churning comment.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.800
Asking the audience to imagine what it would be like

07:00.800 --> 07:03.840
to do this whole video with the Minuteman missile,

07:03.840 --> 07:08.160
but in the video itself is the evidence that it wasn't the Minuteman missile.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.920
It was the Trident missile.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.880
Oh no.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.920
I didn't have to imagine what it was like to do this video.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.880
I was the guy who did this video.

07:16.880 --> 07:17.680
Not good.

07:17.680 --> 07:18.960
At the time I read this comment,

07:18.960 --> 07:20.960
basically seconds away from total collapse,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
I was in no condition to address it.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.520
But let's just say I didn't sleep well that night,

07:25.520 --> 07:28.320
and will skip the depressive, self-destructive, self-doubting part

07:28.320 --> 07:30.560
and jump back to where, with a rebooted brain,

07:30.560 --> 07:32.240
I was able to confirm that yes,

07:32.240 --> 07:34.320
HODIS-8 was right and I was wrong.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.040
Ticoi did not test Minuteman missile motors.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.800
Ticoi tested tridents.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.000
I even found a poster of one in the exploration video itself.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.160
I can't see anything down that corridor.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.560
Alright, strategic pride.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.600
You may be wondering how I could have spent so long on this topic

07:51.600 --> 07:54.320
and yet missed the answer to the most fundamental question,

07:54.320 --> 07:55.680
the literal video title.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.960
What was Ticoi?

07:56.960 --> 07:58.160
Well, me too.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.760
So we conducted an autopsy.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.280
Oh god, this is only halfway through.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.400
It really is a long letter.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.280
Okay, because there was so little available information about Ticoi,

08:05.280 --> 08:07.680
in that pre-script early exploration phase,

08:07.680 --> 08:10.240
I ended up reading a lot about the Cold War in general,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.000
which was interesting, unlike most history,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.840
but was more than a little infuriating,

08:13.840 --> 08:16.480
because all the areas right around Ticoi,

08:16.480 --> 08:18.000
the Magna Manufacturing Plant,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.040
the Wendover Airfield,

08:19.040 --> 08:20.400
the Utah Test and Training Range,

08:20.400 --> 08:21.520
the Dugway Proving Ground,

08:21.520 --> 08:22.640
all kept popping up,

08:22.640 --> 08:24.800
but never coy Ticoi herself.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.520
And this is where some mind-muddling began to occur,

08:27.520 --> 08:30.880
because while I learned the United States Cold War nuclear deterrence forces

08:30.880 --> 08:32.720
had three branches, land, sea and air,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.920
most of what I read talked a lot about the ground-based Minuteman missiles,

08:35.920 --> 08:39.440
less so about nuclear bombers and very little about the nuclear subs.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.640
So in my mind, the Minutemen became the real stars of the Cold War,

08:42.640 --> 08:44.320
which played into the later era.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.320
I did eventually find this book about the history

08:46.320 --> 08:48.800
of the Hercules Powder Company that built Ticoi.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.560
And while the book contains more information

08:50.560 --> 08:52.960
about a now non-existent chemical manufacturing company

08:52.960 --> 08:54.880
than most people could reasonably want to know,

08:54.880 --> 08:59.200
it does not in its 433 pages mention Ticoi even once.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.920
Either because in comparison to the breathtakingly large

09:01.920 --> 09:03.280
international scope of the company,

09:03.280 --> 09:06.080
Ticoi was just too small to warrant even a passing mention,

09:06.080 --> 09:08.480
or because the work at Ticoi was classified.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.120
Or both.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.920
But I was still determined to make a video about this place

09:11.920 --> 09:14.000
I had become more than a little obsessed with

09:14.000 --> 09:17.440
and was now a connection point to future topics in the grayverse.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.920
So with what I did have, I went through the process

09:19.920 --> 09:21.760
and it is somewhere in the earliest drafts

09:21.760 --> 09:24.800
I wrote down Ticoi tested Minuteman Missile Motors.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.640
That is wrong, but I didn't realize.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.720
And it didn't occur to me to double check

09:28.720 --> 09:31.760
because at this stage, the script was still filled with

09:31.760 --> 09:34.880
show-stopping holes in need of dire attention

09:34.880 --> 09:37.360
before the video had a hope of getting published.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.200
Holes like, what are these things for?

09:39.200 --> 09:40.800
Why is this building on rails?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.080
How did all this work?

09:42.080 --> 09:44.720
Now, finding an expert who could discuss the classified details

09:44.720 --> 09:48.320
of a site involved in nuclear weapons production proved impossible.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
While there are people who are experts,

09:50.480 --> 09:52.800
and though Ticoi was abandoned for decades,

09:52.800 --> 09:56.560
the United States government still takes her secrets pretty seriously.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.760
Fun fact, some of the information, uh, revealed

09:59.760 --> 10:02.480
required legal consultation to determine if it could be

10:02.480 --> 10:05.920
publicly discussed without, you know, going to prison.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.080
It was looking pretty bad for the project,

10:08.080 --> 10:10.560
but I did get one confidential military expert

10:10.560 --> 10:14.080
who worked at sites like Ticoi to review an early draft of the video

10:14.080 --> 10:17.280
and who explained how sites like this worked and filled in the holes.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.920
But they hadn't worked at Ticoi itself.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.960
Thus had no reason to know or comment on Ticoi

10:22.960 --> 10:27.200
being part of the sea-based arm of nuclear deterrence, not ground.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.240
So in the script, this error had no expert to catch it,

10:30.240 --> 10:31.920
but also I didn't catch it.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.200
And in the autopsy, it's clear I had not one, not two,

10:35.200 --> 10:37.840
but three missed chances to catch the error.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.840
First, this test facility footage.

10:39.840 --> 10:44.080
This will be the firing of D5 second stage, pet 5B250.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.560
The D5 spoken refers to the D5 motor

10:46.560 --> 10:49.120
of the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missile.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.000
I did wonder what D5 pet 5B250 meant,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.720
but I assumed it was a serial number or other code.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.960
Typing any version of the spoken words into Google

10:56.960 --> 10:58.400
would have been less than enlightening,

10:58.400 --> 11:01.760
but typing D5 missile would have brought me right to it.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.080
Second, the list of inspectable sites for start.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.680
I had been reading about the US-USSR negotiations and inspection sites,

11:07.680 --> 11:10.400
but never saw an exact list until I pulled this one

11:10.400 --> 11:12.480
from the Federation of American Scientists.

11:12.480 --> 11:16.400
Here, I did notice that Ticoi was under the SLBM header, not the ICBM header,

11:16.400 --> 11:20.080
but I didn't investigate because, at this point, the video was in final animation

11:20.080 --> 11:23.520
and I was trying to wrap things up, not wander off the path again.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.280
Deciding when to stop tracking down every little thing is a vital skill,

11:27.280 --> 11:29.360
if you, say, ever want to finish a project.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.200
And if you go watch the director's commentary,

11:31.200 --> 11:34.400
you can listen to poor innocent Grey, who doesn't know what's coming,

11:34.400 --> 11:36.160
discuss that point several times.

11:36.160 --> 11:40.720
But this time, all I had do was but lift my reluctant eyes to the top of the page

11:40.720 --> 11:42.560
and there behold my answer.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.520
SLBM.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.680
Submarine-launched ballistic missile.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.040
How embarrassing.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.320
But it gets one worse.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.080
Missed chance three, the timeline.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.560
Over the years, one of the most effective tools I've found

11:52.560 --> 11:56.080
to disentangle a complicated subject is the humble timeline.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.920
Sources you discover in a random order, and books often discuss topics out of order,

11:59.920 --> 12:03.200
so it's clarifying to just write out a list of what happened when.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.320
And this often highlights bad or contradictory sources.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.480
This is where I unambiguously failed the hardest.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.360
To simplify, I've been calling the Minuteman missile the Minuteman missile,

12:11.360 --> 12:12.480
but there's actually three.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.280
One, two, three.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.760
First deployed in 62, 65, and 70.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.960
The United States ordered 1,000 to be built,

12:18.960 --> 12:21.680
and I don't know how long it took to fill that order.

12:21.680 --> 12:24.160
Most sources gave a vague the 70s,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.680
but maddeningly, in doing another round of investigating for this video,

12:27.680 --> 12:32.880
we found government sources ranging from 1977 to 1963.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.360
What the deal is with that, I have no idea.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.800
I have to stop investigating now,

12:36.800 --> 12:39.840
otherwise this correction video, you're hopefully still watching,

12:39.840 --> 12:41.280
will never get published.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.960
But this is exactly how a timeline can show you something's up.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.000
And Past Gray should have known better than to just accept a vague

12:48.000 --> 12:51.200
the 70s for the full 1,000 Minuteman deployment.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.440
That sort of phrase is a yellow flag in general,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.920
but even if that means the later half of the decade,

12:55.920 --> 12:58.880
T-Coy was, probably, built in 1976,

12:58.880 --> 13:01.920
which is a tight timeline to have tested the Minuteman.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.240
This is 100% my fault.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.720
I should have caught this way early in the process,

13:06.720 --> 13:07.920
but I just didn't.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.080
Which, well, is why we're all here.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.520
Okay, so big deal.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.480
You got the wrong missile.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.640
Why not just fix the video and replace it?

13:14.640 --> 13:20.320
A good question that drags us down into the detailed bowels of how YouTube works.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.680
YouTube does not let creators replace videos with new versions.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.680
You have to upload a whole new video,

13:25.680 --> 13:29.920
which risks annoying literally millions of people with redundant notifications,

13:29.920 --> 13:32.160
should YouTube choose to send them,

13:32.160 --> 13:36.080
and tempts the YouTube gods to look unfavorably upon your channel,

13:36.080 --> 13:39.760
because that last video had terrible engagement.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.160
While I will publicly and loudly complain that YouTube won't let creators replace videos,

13:44.160 --> 13:45.840
I'm also secretly grateful for this,

13:45.840 --> 13:48.960
because it forces a definitive end to projects,

13:48.960 --> 13:52.560
without which my channel would doubtless have but a single video still.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.080
The difference between the United Kingdom, Great Britain, and England explained,

13:56.080 --> 14:00.080
which I would have spent the last 10 years tweaking, revising, expanding, fixing,

14:00.080 --> 14:03.440
and fixing again as the fixes introduced new things to be fixed.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.080
Oh, and updating as the facts themselves changed.

14:06.080 --> 14:10.400
So I can't believe YouTube won't let me replace a video with an updated version.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.080
But also, please don't ever let me YouTube,

14:12.080 --> 14:14.400
I only have a career because you forced me to move on.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.320
Now there is additionally a general opportunity cost of going backward,

14:18.320 --> 14:22.000
instead of making something new, separate from the specifics of YouTube.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.640
So how to decide in general when the mountain of backwards cost is worth ascending?

14:26.640 --> 14:30.160
To discuss, let's visit The Menagerie of Mistakes.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.880
For example, in the video about Northern Ireland's lack of flag, Scotland has three arms.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.160
This is a glitch.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.800
Glitches are harmless if annoying creatures.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.160
Well, annoying to creators.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.240
For audiences, they are fun and easy to catch,

14:42.240 --> 14:44.400
which is why within seconds of posting a video,

14:44.400 --> 14:46.880
Scotland has three arms will be the top comment.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.960
Glitches get in because for the creator,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.680
glitches are really good at hiding in plain sight,

14:51.680 --> 14:53.600
surviving revision after revision.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.400
And if you do spot them and try to fix them in a rush,

14:56.400 --> 14:58.560
you often just cause their multiplication.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.880
It's best to realize glitches will always be with you,

15:00.880 --> 15:03.760
and accept their companionship as part of the process.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.360
Next over, we have blunders.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.200
Blunders make you look like a fool, but still in a mostly harmless way.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.360
I've only ever once before re-uploaded a video,

15:11.360 --> 15:14.080
and it was Holland vs The Netherlands because of a blunder

15:14.080 --> 15:17.520
everyone caught minutes after publication and I couldn't live with.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.240
Swapped flags of France and The Netherlands at one spot.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.600
That's wrong and embarrassing, but had it not been caught instantly,

15:23.600 --> 15:26.320
I probably would have had to learn to leave it be,

15:26.320 --> 15:29.520
in the same way I blundered this name, pronouncing it Currico,

15:29.520 --> 15:33.600
demonstrating exactly how familiar I was with the place or the alcohol.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.080
When you're feeling amazing about a thing that you've made,

15:36.080 --> 15:39.280
it really tempts delighting a blunder to steal your thunder.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.480
Next are errors.

15:40.480 --> 15:45.200
Ugly, charmless things without redeeming value that come in many different species,

15:45.200 --> 15:51.600
from error trivialis, bad takeus, technically correctus, error factualis, and many, many others.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.880
Their variety make it impossible to talk about management in general,

15:54.880 --> 15:58.160
because unlike glitches and blunders, which look the same to everyone,

15:58.160 --> 16:00.320
errors come from the what-is-true dimension,

16:00.320 --> 16:05.200
which means different humans will perceive their size and importance and species in different ways,

16:05.200 --> 16:07.760
or disagree about if there's an error at all.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.240
But if you make things, there will be errors,

16:10.240 --> 16:12.880
and post-publication, deciding what to do about them

16:12.880 --> 16:16.240
will have to take into account the size and species you perceive,

16:16.240 --> 16:20.480
and the cost of extracting its disgusting tentacles from what you have made,

16:20.480 --> 16:23.920
versus the benefits of accepting that you can't always get them all

16:23.920 --> 16:25.840
and moving onward to make a new thing.

16:26.480 --> 16:31.120
But when errors grow large enough, they become a new subspecies.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.040
The error catastrophicus.

16:33.040 --> 16:37.200
An error that fundamentally breaks at least part of what you have made,

16:37.200 --> 16:41.440
and in making a straight factual video called What is Ticoi,

16:41.440 --> 16:43.760
a video that was, at the time of publication,

16:43.760 --> 16:48.320
the only generally accessible summary of information about this location,

16:48.320 --> 16:53.600
getting which type of missile they tested wrong is a catastrophic factual error.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.760
Which is why I decided to fix it.

16:56.080 --> 16:56.960
Part four.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.400
There were no other parts.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.760
But this is finally the end.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.760
My dad always said to me,

17:01.760 --> 17:04.080
the cost of perfection is infinite.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.600
And he was totally right.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.480
I can't promise perfection, but post-autopsy,

17:08.480 --> 17:12.720
me and the team are not only working on future videos with this experience in mind,

17:12.720 --> 17:15.520
but also working on the process that makes the videos,

17:15.520 --> 17:20.720
and if we need to make that process longer to bring videos closer to perfection, we will.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.280
Without a doubt, future me will watch this video

17:23.280 --> 17:27.280
and wonder why oh why did past Grey have so many words in this script

17:27.280 --> 17:29.120
to convey the simple message,

17:29.120 --> 17:30.080
I was wrong.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.360
I apologize.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.320
I fixed it.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.720
But future Grey isn't current Grey,

17:34.720 --> 17:37.120
and as Pascal famously quipped,

17:37.120 --> 17:40.160
If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.

17:40.160 --> 17:44.240
The old Ticoi video is now unlisted if you're curious to see what's changed.

17:44.240 --> 17:49.120
The director's commentary is public now as a sort of historical curiosity, I guess.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.880
And the new version of What is Ticoi is here for you to watch.

17:52.880 --> 17:58.560
I hope you like it, again, and thank you for making it to the end.
