0	1520	As Mark Twain once quipped,
1520	4240	If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.
4240	8000	There's a pair of videos on my channel that were in the works for over a year.
8000	9200	The Ticoi videos.
9200	11600	One exploration and one explanation.
11600	14000	And while the exploration video is fine,
14000	17440	I made a catastrophic error in the explanation video.
17440	19120	I've re-uploaded a corrected version,
19120	24160	and I've also made this video to show you some of the behind the scenes of how those videos got made,
24160	28080	how the error got in, and how the decision to re-upload came to be.
28080	31440	But I've written this video in as little time as possible
31440	34080	to correct the error as fast as possible.
34080	35360	So be warned.
35360	36560	It's a long letter.
36560	42160	The story of Ticoi starts with past Grey traveling to Indian reservations for an other project.
42160	46720	During that wandering, I came across the Skull Valley Indian Reservation out in Utah,
46720	49360	and within its borders, the Ticoi Test Range.
49360	52160	Information about which was limited and scattered.
52160	55600	I got the impression it was an abandoned military weapons facility.
55600	56320	Which, come on.
56320	57920	Three more intriguing adjectives.
57920	59520	You could not precede a noun.
59520	63200	At this point on YouTube, I'd played around with making a few vlog-style videos,
63200	65120	and while working on the bigger project,
65120	69600	I thought Ticoi could be a little shard to examine to make into an easy and quick vlog,
69600	72000	exploring the place and explaining what it was.
72000	76240	And the tribal government graciously granted me permission to go on site and film.
76240	78880	Which, as a side note, please do not try to visit Ticoi.
78880	80080	It is private property.
80080	82720	Not open to the public and super dangerous.
82720	87360	In retrospect, I was shockingly stupid to explore it in as unprepared fashion as I did.
87360	90080	But I went, I filmed, I didn't fall in a hole and die,
90080	92640	or catch histoplasmosis from the bat droppings everywhere,
92640	94240	and I didn't get attacked by the quote,
94240	95360	really mean owl.
95360	97520	I was warned, defended, warehouse number.
97520	99280	Oh, I forgot to write it down.
99280	101840	Seriously, I could not have been a worse urbex noob,
101840	104160	but the celestial dice rolled in my favor that day,
104160	106960	and I got back to my hotel with some amazing video.
106960	109760	Now all I needed to do was explain this beautiful shard.
109760	111200	Of course, joke was on me,
111200	115280	because every topic is an entire world unto itself once you start looking,
115280	118000	and months later, the one video split into two,
118000	122400	and I was barely closer to a coherent explanation of Ticoi than at the start.
122400	123360	Okay, pause here,
123360	126720	and let me tell you a little bit about the video production process in general.
126720	130960	Videos get started either through wandering the real world or the forest of all knowledge,
130960	133040	seeing an interesting area, exploring it,
133040	136080	and, if lucky, some part will look like it could be a video.
136080	138480	I've come to accept that I am a slow writer,
138480	143600	so it's best to hold off the first serious draft until long into the exploration phase,
143600	146000	often long enough that by the time I get to the
146000	148480	okay, seriously, sit down and write this thing,
148480	150640	I've forgotten a lot of what I've read,
150640	155680	but that's actually a useful way to filter for the interesting and important and frequent ideas
155680	159760	in a topic before the many, many rounds of revisions and checks to come.
159760	161520	I used to make my videos all alone,
161520	163600	but over the years I've gathered a small team,
163600	167600	and at some point, if I can get the script into a readable-ish version,
167600	170640	it's time to let the team know what the next project might be.
170640	173440	And there is celebration or dread at what will be
173440	176400	at least many weeks of their lives spent on this thing.
176400	179520	Everyone has a specialty, animation, research, logistics, music,
179520	181280	sometimes custom artwork or audio,
181280	184160	and everyone provides useful feedback on the topic,
184160	187200	sometimes having personal experience or finding further details
187200	189360	or hunting down related lost artifacts.
189360	191920	For me, there's also a lot of double-checking at this point,
191920	194560	going back to notes I made during exploration time
194560	197120	or looking into an out-of-place seeming fact.
197120	199600	The script eventually progresses from merely readable
199600	202000	into what is nearing a final-ish form,
202000	204160	and this is where it's sent out to experts.
204160	206960	Now, this phase seems like it should be the easiest.
206960	208480	A teacher checks your homework,
208480	210080	but often it's quite troublesome.
210080	212240	The first problem is finding an expert.
212240	217040	If a video ends up being largely a book or paper adaptation and the author is alive,
217040	218240	then that's pretty easy,
218240	220720	and those projects are generally more straightforward.
220720	226320	But for a lot of videos, figuring out who is the expert on this thing isn't always clear,
226320	228880	and for some topics, there simply isn't anyone.
228880	230560	For others, experts may exist,
230560	232640	but finding them is basically impossible
232640	235680	because there isn't a good public record of their expertise.
235680	237520	This last is particularly frustrating
237520	239840	because the instant the final video goes up,
239840	243360	all the unfindable experts will find it and get in touch.
243360	245360	Now, in theory, this problem could be solved
245360	247840	by publicly announcing what the active topics are,
247840	251760	and back when Past Gray's channel was smaller and he younger and naiver,
251760	253360	that's totally a thing he did.
253360	256880	But Current Gray in current year has seen shockingly blatant cases
256880	260560	of those who work fast scooping topics from those who work slow.
260560	262960	It's not the early days of the internet anymore,
262960	266240	and surviving while supporting a team means you must compete
266240	270160	with the entire entertainment industry in all its forms.
270160	272000	So some secrecy is necessary,
272000	274240	even though, yes, I'm fully aware I've already developed
274240	276880	what I'm working on in this very video and I will do it again later,
276880	277920	but I've made an exception,
277920	282240	even though I know from experience I've never not regretted talking about work in progress.
282240	285120	Even if the topic is unscooped or unscoopable,
285120	288080	I just find projects harder to finish once they're out in the open
288080	289440	and everyone is watching.
289440	290560	Back to the experts.
290560	293600	If they exist and we find them and they're willing to help out
293600	296000	and they're willing to keep a secret for possibly months,
296000	296960	then that's great.
296960	298400	But it can still be tricky.
298400	300080	For example, which experts?
300080	302560	Just about any academic topic will have experts
302560	306160	who have spent their entire lives thinking about this one area
306160	309120	and who also violently disagree with each other.
309120	311040	Which can leave you, the non-expert,
311040	314400	to wander dangerously close to the what-is-true dimension,
314400	315520	which, if you're not careful,
315520	318400	will suck you into an unproductive downward spiral of
318400	320720	how do we know anything is true?
320720	322320	This happens to me at least once a month
322320	325120	and is a topic which is way beyond the scope of this video,
325120	326720	maybe a story for another time.
326720	328080	Ugh, don't say that!
328080	329760	Okay, skipping the existential crisis,
329760	331600	the script is sent out to experts for checking
331600	333440	and then the final draft can be recorded
333440	335520	and turned into a video for you to watch.
335520	336960	That's how it works in general.
336960	340080	Now let's resume the story of Ticoi skipping ahead to...
340080	341120	Upload Day!
341120	343520	A day that is simultaneously the joyous completion
343520	344880	of hundreds of hours of teamwork
344880	346640	and the solitude of stomach churning
346640	349760	as you wait to find out if you have been wrong on the internet.
349760	352560	And there are many ways to be wrong on the internet,
352560	353760	which we will visit later.
353760	356640	But the process is designed to be able to avoid errors
356640	360080	while still being able to publish something eventually.
360080	361040	And in this process,
361040	363680	I had learned that my initial impression wasn't quite right.
363680	367600	Rather, Ticoi was a tiny part of an enormous for-profit company
367600	371520	that used Ticoi as a static firing test range for rocket motors.
371520	374560	Motors that just so happened to be used in nuclear missiles,
374560	376080	including the famous Minuteman.
376080	378880	But there's often so much more left on the cutting room floor,
378880	382080	so a new part of the process is doing a director's commentary
382080	384400	for crowdfunders with all the extra bits,
384400	386320	after I've waited a couple of hours to ensure
386320	389680	there's no Upload Day disaster that needs immediate attention.
389680	392160	The internet will tell you real fast if you're wrong,
392160	396080	but on Ticoi Upload Day, the stomach-churning lessened as nothing came in,
396080	398800	I went and streamed the commentary in a pretty relieved mood,
398800	401360	as this has become a nice psychological marker for me
401360	404640	that a project is truly and completely finally finished.
404640	406320	Doing the commentary kept me up late,
406320	408320	but satisfied with a long day's work,
408320	410720	I decided right before trying to sleep,
410720	413360	let me check the comments one more time.
413360	415680	And that is when I found this.
415680	418240	The maximum possible stomach-churning comment.
418240	420800	Asking the audience to imagine what it would be like
420800	423840	to do this whole video with the Minuteman missile,
423840	428160	but in the video itself is the evidence that it wasn't the Minuteman missile.
428160	429920	It was the Trident missile.
429920	430880	Oh no.
430880	433920	I didn't have to imagine what it was like to do this video.
433920	436880	I was the guy who did this video.
436880	437680	Not good.
437680	438960	At the time I read this comment,
438960	440960	basically seconds away from total collapse,
440960	442960	I was in no condition to address it.
442960	445520	But let's just say I didn't sleep well that night,
445520	448320	and will skip the depressive, self-destructive, self-doubting part
448320	450560	and jump back to where, with a rebooted brain,
450560	452240	I was able to confirm that yes,
452240	454320	HODIS-8 was right and I was wrong.
454320	457040	Ticoi did not test Minuteman missile motors.
457040	458800	Ticoi tested tridents.
458800	462000	I even found a poster of one in the exploration video itself.
462000	464160	I can't see anything down that corridor.
465200	466560	Alright, strategic pride.
468960	471600	You may be wondering how I could have spent so long on this topic
471600	474320	and yet missed the answer to the most fundamental question,
474320	475680	the literal video title.
475680	476960	What was Ticoi?
476960	478160	Well, me too.
478160	479760	So we conducted an autopsy.
479760	481280	Oh god, this is only halfway through.
481280	482400	It really is a long letter.
482400	485280	Okay, because there was so little available information about Ticoi,
485280	487680	in that pre-script early exploration phase,
487680	490240	I ended up reading a lot about the Cold War in general,
490240	492000	which was interesting, unlike most history,
492000	493840	but was more than a little infuriating,
493840	496480	because all the areas right around Ticoi,
496480	498000	the Magna Manufacturing Plant,
498000	499040	the Wendover Airfield,
499040	500400	the Utah Test and Training Range,
500400	501520	the Dugway Proving Ground,
501520	502640	all kept popping up,
502640	504800	but never coy Ticoi herself.
504800	507520	And this is where some mind-muddling began to occur,
507520	510880	because while I learned the United States Cold War nuclear deterrence forces
510880	512720	had three branches, land, sea and air,
512720	515920	most of what I read talked a lot about the ground-based Minuteman missiles,
515920	519440	less so about nuclear bombers and very little about the nuclear subs.
519440	522640	So in my mind, the Minutemen became the real stars of the Cold War,
522640	524320	which played into the later era.
524320	526320	I did eventually find this book about the history
526320	528800	of the Hercules Powder Company that built Ticoi.
528800	530560	And while the book contains more information
530560	532960	about a now non-existent chemical manufacturing company
532960	534880	than most people could reasonably want to know,
534880	539200	it does not in its 433 pages mention Ticoi even once.
539200	541920	Either because in comparison to the breathtakingly large
541920	543280	international scope of the company,
543280	546080	Ticoi was just too small to warrant even a passing mention,
546080	548480	or because the work at Ticoi was classified.
548480	549120	Or both.
549120	551920	But I was still determined to make a video about this place
551920	554000	I had become more than a little obsessed with
554000	557440	and was now a connection point to future topics in the grayverse.
557440	559920	So with what I did have, I went through the process
559920	561760	and it is somewhere in the earliest drafts
561760	564800	I wrote down Ticoi tested Minuteman Missile Motors.
564800	566640	That is wrong, but I didn't realize.
566640	568720	And it didn't occur to me to double check
568720	571760	because at this stage, the script was still filled with
571760	574880	show-stopping holes in need of dire attention
574880	577360	before the video had a hope of getting published.
577360	579200	Holes like, what are these things for?
579200	580800	Why is this building on rails?
580800	582080	How did all this work?
582080	584720	Now, finding an expert who could discuss the classified details
584720	588320	of a site involved in nuclear weapons production proved impossible.
588320	590480	While there are people who are experts,
590480	592800	and though Ticoi was abandoned for decades,
592800	596560	the United States government still takes her secrets pretty seriously.
596560	599760	Fun fact, some of the information, uh, revealed
599760	602480	required legal consultation to determine if it could be
602480	605920	publicly discussed without, you know, going to prison.
605920	608080	It was looking pretty bad for the project,
608080	610560	but I did get one confidential military expert
610560	614080	who worked at sites like Ticoi to review an early draft of the video
614080	617280	and who explained how sites like this worked and filled in the holes.
617280	619920	But they hadn't worked at Ticoi itself.
619920	622960	Thus had no reason to know or comment on Ticoi
622960	627200	being part of the sea-based arm of nuclear deterrence, not ground.
627200	630240	So in the script, this error had no expert to catch it,
630240	631920	but also I didn't catch it.
631920	635200	And in the autopsy, it's clear I had not one, not two,
635200	637840	but three missed chances to catch the error.
637840	639840	First, this test facility footage.
639840	644080	This will be the firing of D5 second stage, pet 5B250.
644080	646560	The D5 spoken refers to the D5 motor
646560	649120	of the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missile.
649120	652000	I did wonder what D5 pet 5B250 meant,
652000	654720	but I assumed it was a serial number or other code.
654720	656960	Typing any version of the spoken words into Google
656960	658400	would have been less than enlightening,
658400	661760	but typing D5 missile would have brought me right to it.
661760	664080	Second, the list of inspectable sites for start.
664080	667680	I had been reading about the US-USSR negotiations and inspection sites,
667680	670400	but never saw an exact list until I pulled this one
670400	672480	from the Federation of American Scientists.
672480	676400	Here, I did notice that Ticoi was under the SLBM header, not the ICBM header,
676400	680080	but I didn't investigate because, at this point, the video was in final animation
680080	683520	and I was trying to wrap things up, not wander off the path again.
683520	687280	Deciding when to stop tracking down every little thing is a vital skill,
687280	689360	if you, say, ever want to finish a project.
689360	691200	And if you go watch the director's commentary,
691200	694400	you can listen to poor innocent Grey, who doesn't know what's coming,
694400	696160	discuss that point several times.
696160	700720	But this time, all I had do was but lift my reluctant eyes to the top of the page
700720	702560	and there behold my answer.
702560	703520	SLBM.
703520	705680	Submarine-launched ballistic missile.
705680	707040	How embarrassing.
707040	708320	But it gets one worse.
708320	710080	Missed chance three, the timeline.
710080	712560	Over the years, one of the most effective tools I've found
712560	716080	to disentangle a complicated subject is the humble timeline.
716080	719920	Sources you discover in a random order, and books often discuss topics out of order,
719920	723200	so it's clarifying to just write out a list of what happened when.
723200	726320	And this often highlights bad or contradictory sources.
726320	728480	This is where I unambiguously failed the hardest.
728480	731360	To simplify, I've been calling the Minuteman missile the Minuteman missile,
731360	732480	but there's actually three.
732480	733280	One, two, three.
733280	735760	First deployed in 62, 65, and 70.
735760	738960	The United States ordered 1,000 to be built,
738960	741680	and I don't know how long it took to fill that order.
741680	744160	Most sources gave a vague the 70s,
744160	747680	but maddeningly, in doing another round of investigating for this video,
747680	752880	we found government sources ranging from 1977 to 1963.
752880	755360	What the deal is with that, I have no idea.
755360	756800	I have to stop investigating now,
756800	759840	otherwise this correction video, you're hopefully still watching,
759840	761280	will never get published.
761280	764960	But this is exactly how a timeline can show you something's up.
764960	768000	And Past Gray should have known better than to just accept a vague
768000	771200	the 70s for the full 1,000 Minuteman deployment.
771200	773440	That sort of phrase is a yellow flag in general,
773440	775920	but even if that means the later half of the decade,
775920	778880	T-Coy was, probably, built in 1976,
778880	781920	which is a tight timeline to have tested the Minuteman.
781920	784240	This is 100% my fault.
784240	786720	I should have caught this way early in the process,
786720	787920	but I just didn't.
787920	790080	Which, well, is why we're all here.
790560	791520	Okay, so big deal.
791520	792480	You got the wrong missile.
792480	794640	Why not just fix the video and replace it?
794640	800320	A good question that drags us down into the detailed bowels of how YouTube works.
800320	803680	YouTube does not let creators replace videos with new versions.
803680	805680	You have to upload a whole new video,
805680	809920	which risks annoying literally millions of people with redundant notifications,
809920	812160	should YouTube choose to send them,
812160	816080	and tempts the YouTube gods to look unfavorably upon your channel,
816080	819760	because that last video had terrible engagement.
820080	824160	While I will publicly and loudly complain that YouTube won't let creators replace videos,
824160	825840	I'm also secretly grateful for this,
825840	828960	because it forces a definitive end to projects,
828960	832560	without which my channel would doubtless have but a single video still.
832560	836080	The difference between the United Kingdom, Great Britain, and England explained,
836080	840080	which I would have spent the last 10 years tweaking, revising, expanding, fixing,
840080	843440	and fixing again as the fixes introduced new things to be fixed.
843440	846080	Oh, and updating as the facts themselves changed.
846080	850400	So I can't believe YouTube won't let me replace a video with an updated version.
850400	852080	But also, please don't ever let me YouTube,
852080	854400	I only have a career because you forced me to move on.
854400	858320	Now there is additionally a general opportunity cost of going backward,
858320	862000	instead of making something new, separate from the specifics of YouTube.
862000	866640	So how to decide in general when the mountain of backwards cost is worth ascending?
866640	870160	To discuss, let's visit The Menagerie of Mistakes.
870160	874880	For example, in the video about Northern Ireland's lack of flag, Scotland has three arms.
874880	876160	This is a glitch.
876160	878800	Glitches are harmless if annoying creatures.
878800	880160	Well, annoying to creators.
880160	882240	For audiences, they are fun and easy to catch,
882240	884400	which is why within seconds of posting a video,
884400	886880	Scotland has three arms will be the top comment.
886880	888960	Glitches get in because for the creator,
888960	891680	glitches are really good at hiding in plain sight,
891680	893600	surviving revision after revision.
893600	896400	And if you do spot them and try to fix them in a rush,
896400	898560	you often just cause their multiplication.
898560	900880	It's best to realize glitches will always be with you,
900880	903760	and accept their companionship as part of the process.
903760	905360	Next over, we have blunders.
905360	909200	Blunders make you look like a fool, but still in a mostly harmless way.
909200	911360	I've only ever once before re-uploaded a video,
911360	914080	and it was Holland vs The Netherlands because of a blunder
914080	917520	everyone caught minutes after publication and I couldn't live with.
917520	920240	Swapped flags of France and The Netherlands at one spot.
920240	923600	That's wrong and embarrassing, but had it not been caught instantly,
923600	926320	I probably would have had to learn to leave it be,
926320	929520	in the same way I blundered this name, pronouncing it Currico,
929520	933600	demonstrating exactly how familiar I was with the place or the alcohol.
933600	936080	When you're feeling amazing about a thing that you've made,
936080	939280	it really tempts delighting a blunder to steal your thunder.
939280	940480	Next are errors.
940480	945200	Ugly, charmless things without redeeming value that come in many different species,
945200	951600	from error trivialis, bad takeus, technically correctus, error factualis, and many, many others.
951600	954880	Their variety make it impossible to talk about management in general,
954880	958160	because unlike glitches and blunders, which look the same to everyone,
958160	960320	errors come from the what-is-true dimension,
960320	965200	which means different humans will perceive their size and importance and species in different ways,
965200	967760	or disagree about if there's an error at all.
967760	970240	But if you make things, there will be errors,
970240	972880	and post-publication, deciding what to do about them
972880	976240	will have to take into account the size and species you perceive,
976240	980480	and the cost of extracting its disgusting tentacles from what you have made,
980480	983920	versus the benefits of accepting that you can't always get them all
983920	985840	and moving onward to make a new thing.
986480	991120	But when errors grow large enough, they become a new subspecies.
991120	993040	The error catastrophicus.
993040	997200	An error that fundamentally breaks at least part of what you have made,
997200	1001440	and in making a straight factual video called What is Ticoi,
1001440	1003760	a video that was, at the time of publication,
1003760	1008320	the only generally accessible summary of information about this location,
1008320	1013600	getting which type of missile they tested wrong is a catastrophic factual error.
1013600	1015760	Which is why I decided to fix it.
1016080	1016960	Part four.
1016960	1018400	There were no other parts.
1018400	1019760	But this is finally the end.
1020400	1021760	My dad always said to me,
1021760	1024080	the cost of perfection is infinite.
1024080	1025600	And he was totally right.
1025600	1028480	I can't promise perfection, but post-autopsy,
1028480	1032720	me and the team are not only working on future videos with this experience in mind,
1032720	1035520	but also working on the process that makes the videos,
1035520	1040720	and if we need to make that process longer to bring videos closer to perfection, we will.
1040720	1043280	Without a doubt, future me will watch this video
1043280	1047280	and wonder why oh why did past Grey have so many words in this script
1047280	1049120	to convey the simple message,
1049120	1050080	I was wrong.
1050080	1051360	I apologize.
1051360	1052320	I fixed it.
1052320	1054720	But future Grey isn't current Grey,
1054720	1057120	and as Pascal famously quipped,
1057120	1060160	If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.
1060160	1064240	The old Ticoi video is now unlisted if you're curious to see what's changed.
1064240	1069120	The director's commentary is public now as a sort of historical curiosity, I guess.
1069120	1072880	And the new version of What is Ticoi is here for you to watch.
1072880	1078560	I hope you like it, again, and thank you for making it to the end.
