1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There is no greater human joy than waking up to a winter wonderland that, with its frosty magic, also cancelled school.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, no more, because schools are cancelling snow days.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Some school systems have decided distance learning has worked so well, might as well keep those tools around.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This way, when there's too much snow to physically drag students in, we can still mentally drag them in.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What kind of villains are you?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The worst kind. The kind doing something for your own good.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You don't want students to miss learning, do you?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We all agree that each and every individual day of school matters to keep kids from falling behind.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We don't all agree. This is horrifying.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Internet, where are you? Where's hashtag save snow days to protect us?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Shh, we don't need that.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, you cannot take away the human experience of being on a dark winter's night, unable to face the next day.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then, when thin clouds appear on the horizon, giving you faint hope, you beg with all of your belief to make it happen.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And when it does happen, it is the most epic experience of low to high.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Combining the triple joys of snow and freedom and getting out of something that you totally shouldn't have,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
there are only so many days of such great glory in a human life.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But, say some school boards, that number of days will be zero forever.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I fear this snow day cancellation pestilation will spread

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
because the school system, with its bureaucracies and committees,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
loves its checkboxes checked, its percentages maxed, and its attendance punch cards punched.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Snow days mess all that up, so the system wielding the ultimate banality of evil cancels snow days.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Look, I'm just gonna say it. This is a crime against childhood.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, I am going to play the won't somebody please think of the children card.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Teenagers, I know you hate this, but it's in your best interest to just roll with it.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But seriously, protecting snow days is what this card was made to play.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Those who want to cancel snow days should be forced to look into the wide, excited eyes of a little girl

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
waking up to experience her very first snow day and tell her,

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, you can't play outside. Why? Because it's super important that today, right now,

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you learn about what a newspaper front page in England 300 years ago thought was important.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And you also must know the French conjugation of the verb to have fun.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This. This is what matters.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you can do that while thinking you are doing good,

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you are a heartless monster extinguishing the light of a child.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A child who, while on their kiddie conference call with their ickle headset,

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
listening to a teacher tell them fractions are fun too,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
will resolve the cognitive dissonance by deciding the whole world is pointlessly cruel,

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and with a sigh say,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is the way it is. This is how it will be.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Humanity is subservient to checkboxes.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No. This shall not pass.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't cancel snow days. Cancel killjoy committees.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hashtag save snow days.
