0	8000	There is no greater human joy than waking up to a winter wonderland that, with its frosty magic, also cancelled school.
8000	12000	Well, no more, because schools are cancelling snow days.
12000	17000	Some school systems have decided distance learning has worked so well, might as well keep those tools around.
17000	23000	This way, when there's too much snow to physically drag students in, we can still mentally drag them in.
23000	27000	What kind of villains are you?
27000	30000	The worst kind. The kind doing something for your own good.
30000	33000	You don't want students to miss learning, do you?
33000	40000	We all agree that each and every individual day of school matters to keep kids from falling behind.
40000	43000	We don't all agree. This is horrifying.
43000	47000	Internet, where are you? Where's hashtag save snow days to protect us?
47000	49000	Shh, we don't need that.
49000	56000	No, you cannot take away the human experience of being on a dark winter's night, unable to face the next day.
56000	64000	Then, when thin clouds appear on the horizon, giving you faint hope, you beg with all of your belief to make it happen.
64000	70000	And when it does happen, it is the most epic experience of low to high.
70000	76000	Combining the triple joys of snow and freedom and getting out of something that you totally shouldn't have,
76000	81000	there are only so many days of such great glory in a human life.
81000	85000	But, say some school boards, that number of days will be zero forever.
85000	89000	And I fear this snow day cancellation pestilation will spread
89000	92000	because the school system, with its bureaucracies and committees,
92000	98000	loves its checkboxes checked, its percentages maxed, and its attendance punch cards punched.
98000	105000	Snow days mess all that up, so the system wielding the ultimate banality of evil cancels snow days.
105000	108000	Look, I'm just gonna say it. This is a crime against childhood.
108000	112000	Yes, I am going to play the won't somebody please think of the children card.
112000	115000	Teenagers, I know you hate this, but it's in your best interest to just roll with it.
115000	121000	But seriously, protecting snow days is what this card was made to play.
121000	126000	Those who want to cancel snow days should be forced to look into the wide, excited eyes of a little girl
126000	130000	waking up to experience her very first snow day and tell her,
130000	136000	No, you can't play outside. Why? Because it's super important that today, right now,
136000	142000	you learn about what a newspaper front page in England 300 years ago thought was important.
142000	146000	And you also must know the French conjugation of the verb to have fun.
150000	153000	This. This is what matters.
153000	156000	If you can do that while thinking you are doing good,
156000	161000	you are a heartless monster extinguishing the light of a child.
161000	165000	A child who, while on their kiddie conference call with their ickle headset,
165000	168000	listening to a teacher tell them fractions are fun too,
168000	173000	will resolve the cognitive dissonance by deciding the whole world is pointlessly cruel,
173000	175000	and with a sigh say,
175000	179000	This is the way it is. This is how it will be.
179000	183000	Humanity is subservient to checkboxes.
183000	185000	No. This shall not pass.
185000	189000	Don't cancel snow days. Cancel killjoy committees.
189000	192000	Hashtag save snow days.
