There is no greater human joy than waking up to a winter wonderland that, with its frosty magic, also cancelled school.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Well, no more, because schools are cancelling snow days.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Some school systems have decided distance learning has worked so well, might as well keep those tools around.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
This way, when there's too much snow to physically drag students in, we can still mentally drag them in.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
What kind of villains are you?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
The worst kind. The kind doing something for your own good.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
You don't want students to miss learning, do you?

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
We all agree that each and every individual day of school matters to keep kids from falling behind.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
We don't all agree. This is horrifying.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Internet, where are you? Where's hashtag save snow days to protect us?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Shh, we don't need that.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
No, you cannot take away the human experience of being on a dark winter's night, unable to face the next day.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
Then, when thin clouds appear on the horizon, giving you faint hope, you beg with all of your belief to make it happen.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
And when it does happen, it is the most epic experience of low to high.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Combining the triple joys of snow and freedom and getting out of something that you totally shouldn't have,

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
there are only so many days of such great glory in a human life.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
But, say some school boards, that number of days will be zero forever.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
And I fear this snow day cancellation pestilation will spread

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
because the school system, with its bureaucracies and committees,

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
loves its checkboxes checked, its percentages maxed, and its attendance punch cards punched.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Snow days mess all that up, so the system wielding the ultimate banality of evil cancels snow days.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Look, I'm just gonna say it. This is a crime against childhood.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Yes, I am going to play the won't somebody please think of the children card.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Teenagers, I know you hate this, but it's in your best interest to just roll with it.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
But seriously, protecting snow days is what this card was made to play.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Those who want to cancel snow days should be forced to look into the wide, excited eyes of a little girl

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
waking up to experience her very first snow day and tell her,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
No, you can't play outside. Why? Because it's super important that today, right now,

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
you learn about what a newspaper front page in England 300 years ago thought was important.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
And you also must know the French conjugation of the verb to have fun.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
This. This is what matters.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
If you can do that while thinking you are doing good,

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
you are a heartless monster extinguishing the light of a child.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
A child who, while on their kiddie conference call with their ickle headset,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
listening to a teacher tell them fractions are fun too,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
will resolve the cognitive dissonance by deciding the whole world is pointlessly cruel,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
and with a sigh say,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
This is the way it is. This is how it will be.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Humanity is subservient to checkboxes.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
No. This shall not pass.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Don't cancel snow days. Cancel killjoy committees.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Hashtag save snow days.
