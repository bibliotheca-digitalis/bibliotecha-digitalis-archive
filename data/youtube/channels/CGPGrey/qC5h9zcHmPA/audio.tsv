0	10440	Hello, internet. Well, here we are. One decade later.
10440	15900	Ten years? Now you've got YouTube tenure. I wish that was how it worked, but it is not.
15900	20280	Has it felt like ten years? No, YouTube still feels like my new job, even though I've put
20280	24400	in almost twice as many YouTube years as teaching years at this point. What can I say? Brains
24400	25180	are weird.
25180	29060	Can we get a lava lamp on the desk, please? Sure. Actually, back when I was a teacher
29140	33100	I always kept a lava lamp on the desk for students, because when I was a student I always
33100	37980	found it easier to listen and to think without also having to make eye contact the whole
37980	41740	time, but you'd get chastised for looking up at the ceiling. Hey, pay attention, kid.
41740	48980	But I was paying attention. Look at me, in the eyes, all day long. Not fun. I figured
48980	52300	I couldn't be the only one like that, so I didn't correct kids for looking away from
52300	58060	me. But also, ceiling gets boring after 13 years of compulsory schooling. Thus came onto
58060	62280	my desk the endlessly hypnotizing lava lamp as focal point. If you're a teacher watching
62280	66540	this, give it a try. It's good for a certain kind of student, and really chills the vibe
66540	68100	of the room, man.
68100	71820	Do you think the next ten years will be better or worse for humanity, and more or less impactful
71820	75680	on human history than the previous ten years? Thinking about impact over the long run of
75680	80060	human history, it's pretty clear that impact tracks with tech and tech with time. Ten thousand
80060	83900	years ago, there was very little you could do to impact the world. So I do expect the
83900	88020	next ten years will be more impactful than the last, and I will bet they're better than
88020	92620	the last. I'm less confident about that second part than I used to be, but I still think
92620	97100	it holds that, on average, each decade is an improvement. That is, until we accidentally
97100	102740	stumble into an existential threat, which is game over. Which is pretty... pretty bad.
102740	105820	Over the last ten years, your channel has grown a lot. What is the most important thing
105820	109640	that you've learned about creating content? If there's anything I've learned from thousands
109640	115360	of spoken words, it's that human communication is hard. Way harder than people think, precisely
115360	119800	because people think it's easy. You just say the words, and the other person hears them,
119800	125560	and bam! Understanding. Alas, no. Words are fuzzy things, and you don't realize how poorly
125560	130000	you string them together until you are forced to listen to yourself saying those words.
130000	133520	And even if you're happy with your string of words, you just don't know how those fuzzy
133520	139080	patterns of sound will pattern match in someone else's brain. Human communication is a dance,
139080	143840	and a dance requires partners. We all create content, and I think we should all keep that
143840	148840	in mind and be much more willing to work with the intended intention of our interlocutors.
148840	152240	What do you miss about internet culture from when you started on YouTube? This is my biggest
152240	156860	I-liked-that-band-before-they-were-popular opinion, but it finally dawned on me recently
156860	162340	that internet culture is the culture now. Even just two Q&As ago, I showed the internet
162340	168480	as the Wild West, but those days are long gone, thrust aside by content mines or suburbs
168480	173140	with homeowners' associations fixated on real estate values. I think Past Gray was
173140	179400	super naive to imagine the internet he loved could possibly both 1. explode in size, and
179400	183240	2. remain the frontier. How do you feel that your number one most-watched video is no longer
183240	189000	your UK explained video? Fantastic. I thought that UK video would forever be my albatross.
189000	194920	Like, oh, he never did anything as popular as the first thing he did. So I was very happy
194920	198780	when the solution to traffic topped the UK. And if the day ever comes where something
198780	201480	newer beats out traffic, I will be thrilled again.
201480	205120	Is there an underlying theme that connects all your videos? Not really. My YouTube colleagues
205120	209380	are forever telling me to be more strategic in the selection of topics, to target content
209380	215740	for growth and views and dolla dolla bills. And I know I should, but I just kind of can't.
215740	219260	Because the videos take so long from idea to completion, the only thing that really
219260	223140	matters is a topic that I can stay interested in for months, and that just doesn't work
223140	227800	for me with strategic selection or trying to have an underlying theme. But I guess if
227800	231760	you're looking for what's similar with all the videos, one human personality slider is
231760	235520	how much you are interested in things versus how much you are interested in people. Most
235520	239240	people are people people, but if you look at my videos, one common connector is the
239240	244260	near-complete dearth of people. What holds my interest tends to be very thing-oriented.
244260	247240	How does it feel to have teenagers that have been watching your content for the majority
247240	252000	of their life? I hadn't thought about that possibility until now, but if there are people
252000	257380	who have watched my videos for the majority of their life, say hi in the comments. What
257380	261860	do you think about the To My Future Me letters or videos? Have you ever made any? Lots of
261860	266240	people ask questions about sending letters forward or backward in time. I wouldn't want
266240	270400	to mess with the timeline going backward, and sending letters forward is boring, which
270400	274080	is why I've never done that sort of thing. Okay, well actually that's not true, no. One
274080	278580	of my teachers in school had us do this to write a letter to ourselves for when we graduated
278580	283300	high school, and when I got it, high school me did not care about anything grade school
283300	288980	me had to say. And so it goes now. I'm confident that ten years from now me would be positively
288980	293300	meh to get a letter from current me, in the same way current me couldn't be more meh about
293300	297380	what ten years ago me thought about anything. What was your closest experience to death
297380	301340	this decade? The nighttime driving that I did in my road trip video. I was at that point
301340	305780	years out of practice driving, I hadn't slept well the night before and had already driven
305780	310380	all day and then attempted to tackle both a super fast highway and then a pretty sketchy
310380	314340	road. Statistically, it is without doubt the most dangerous thing I've done in the last
314340	319140	ten years. Even though people watch the video and go, what's the dumb dangerous decision
319140	324800	he hyped up at the beginning? Driving at nighttime? LOL lame. But the reality of death is banality,
324800	330100	and it's not always visually obvious when death is close. For example, I was on an Indian
330100	335600	reservation for a project exploring a canyon and filming, and it was until a few days later
335600	339880	when reviewing the footage that I saw the solid ground I was standing on was actually
339880	344780	a bit of an overhang. It didn't fall, obviously, but it's going to fall at some point. And
344780	349300	had it done so, well, the reservation was off the main path and the canyon off the path
349300	353960	from that and the path I was on was off the path in the canyon. So an untimely crack would
353960	357680	doubtlessly have been game over. It's been suggested that you've developed an increased
357680	362160	caffeine dependence over the years. At this point, do you consider it an asset or an addiction?
363120	366880	If you had to categorize your YouTube career into eras, how would you split it? I feel
366880	370980	like that's more for the audience to decide what is, for them, the blue period of grey
370980	375320	or whatever, because the public perception of creation can often have very little to
375320	379960	do with the perception or intention of the creator. Again, human communication is difficult
379960	384380	and also art is not the artist. But for me, there's really only one important era shift,
384380	389140	and that's pre-Project Liberty and post-Project Liberty, which was, wait for it, the Statue
389140	394080	of Liberty video. Which I think almost no viewer would pick out as a big deal video,
394080	398680	but to me, it's the biggest. It's the video where I feel like I finally got my own writing
398680	403200	process, personally accepting its advantages and disadvantages. That may sound strange
403200	407840	because I'd been writing videos for seven years at that point, but I think this is just
407840	412420	part of what happens when you do something for a long time. Is the 10-year mark an accomplishment
412420	417080	or a reminder of the inescapable passage of time? Porque no los dos. How has the way you
417080	421380	spend your free time changed over the last 10 years? Two clear trend lines. Video games
421380	425860	up, books down. I've learned there's a huge number of books I just can't read because
425860	429980	I'll want to turn them into videos and I can read books faster than I can make videos,
429980	434220	so reading those would be just creating a huge pile of guilt for myself. And when your
434220	438860	job is mostly writing and reading, it's nice to turn that off, and video games are basically
438860	443140	the only thing in my life that truly shifts my brain into neutral. All that said, I think
443140	448000	that Droppin' Books has gone too far in the last, eh, five years? I don't like making
448000	452120	promises or predictions for my future self, but one of the things I'd like to be able
452120	456800	to say ten years from now is that I've inflected the reading curve. Who is sponsoring this
456800	462080	video? The most frightening video I uploaded this decade was the one where I asked you
462080	467320	to support the channel directly through membership instead of having sponsors. Clicking upload
467320	472240	that day, I didn't know what would happen, but I trusted in you, and since then together
472240	476880	we have learned the trouble with tumbleweed after flying across an ocean, we've talked
476880	483260	like a pirate, gone through the ticoi trilogy together, and of course revealed the perfectagon
483260	488760	of the hexagon and more. It is you who let each video flow from start to finish without
488760	493380	me needing to pause and tell you about our sponsor in the middle. It is you who supports
493380	498300	me, my family, and my team. It's you who allows me to explore the forest of all knowledge
498300	504020	and share what I've found. You sponsor my videos. And thank you. Thank you for everything,
504020	508140	internet. Thank you for my whole life. It's been a wild ten years.
528300	530300	You
