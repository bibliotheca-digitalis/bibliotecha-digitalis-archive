Hello, internet. Well, here we are. One decade later.

00:10.440 --> 00:15.900
Ten years? Now you've got YouTube tenure. I wish that was how it worked, but it is not.

00:15.900 --> 00:20.280
Has it felt like ten years? No, YouTube still feels like my new job, even though I've put

00:20.280 --> 00:24.400
in almost twice as many YouTube years as teaching years at this point. What can I say? Brains

00:24.400 --> 00:25.180
are weird.

00:25.180 --> 00:29.060
Can we get a lava lamp on the desk, please? Sure. Actually, back when I was a teacher

00:29.140 --> 00:33.100
I always kept a lava lamp on the desk for students, because when I was a student I always

00:33.100 --> 00:37.980
found it easier to listen and to think without also having to make eye contact the whole

00:37.980 --> 00:41.740
time, but you'd get chastised for looking up at the ceiling. Hey, pay attention, kid.

00:41.740 --> 00:48.980
But I was paying attention. Look at me, in the eyes, all day long. Not fun. I figured

00:48.980 --> 00:52.300
I couldn't be the only one like that, so I didn't correct kids for looking away from

00:52.300 --> 00:58.060
me. But also, ceiling gets boring after 13 years of compulsory schooling. Thus came onto

00:58.060 --> 01:02.280
my desk the endlessly hypnotizing lava lamp as focal point. If you're a teacher watching

01:02.280 --> 01:06.540
this, give it a try. It's good for a certain kind of student, and really chills the vibe

01:06.540 --> 01:08.100
of the room, man.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.820
Do you think the next ten years will be better or worse for humanity, and more or less impactful

01:11.820 --> 01:15.680
on human history than the previous ten years? Thinking about impact over the long run of

01:15.680 --> 01:20.060
human history, it's pretty clear that impact tracks with tech and tech with time. Ten thousand

01:20.060 --> 01:23.900
years ago, there was very little you could do to impact the world. So I do expect the

01:23.900 --> 01:28.020
next ten years will be more impactful than the last, and I will bet they're better than

01:28.020 --> 01:32.620
the last. I'm less confident about that second part than I used to be, but I still think

01:32.620 --> 01:37.100
it holds that, on average, each decade is an improvement. That is, until we accidentally

01:37.100 --> 01:42.740
stumble into an existential threat, which is game over. Which is pretty... pretty bad.

01:42.740 --> 01:45.820
Over the last ten years, your channel has grown a lot. What is the most important thing

01:45.820 --> 01:49.640
that you've learned about creating content? If there's anything I've learned from thousands

01:49.640 --> 01:55.360
of spoken words, it's that human communication is hard. Way harder than people think, precisely

01:55.360 --> 01:59.800
because people think it's easy. You just say the words, and the other person hears them,

01:59.800 --> 02:05.560
and bam! Understanding. Alas, no. Words are fuzzy things, and you don't realize how poorly

02:05.560 --> 02:10.000
you string them together until you are forced to listen to yourself saying those words.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.520
And even if you're happy with your string of words, you just don't know how those fuzzy

02:13.520 --> 02:19.080
patterns of sound will pattern match in someone else's brain. Human communication is a dance,

02:19.080 --> 02:23.840
and a dance requires partners. We all create content, and I think we should all keep that

02:23.840 --> 02:28.840
in mind and be much more willing to work with the intended intention of our interlocutors.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.240
What do you miss about internet culture from when you started on YouTube? This is my biggest

02:32.240 --> 02:36.860
I-liked-that-band-before-they-were-popular opinion, but it finally dawned on me recently

02:36.860 --> 02:42.340
that internet culture is the culture now. Even just two Q&As ago, I showed the internet

02:42.340 --> 02:48.480
as the Wild West, but those days are long gone, thrust aside by content mines or suburbs

02:48.480 --> 02:53.140
with homeowners' associations fixated on real estate values. I think Past Gray was

02:53.140 --> 02:59.400
super naive to imagine the internet he loved could possibly both 1. explode in size, and

02:59.400 --> 03:03.240
2. remain the frontier. How do you feel that your number one most-watched video is no longer

03:03.240 --> 03:09.000
your UK explained video? Fantastic. I thought that UK video would forever be my albatross.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.920
Like, oh, he never did anything as popular as the first thing he did. So I was very happy

03:14.920 --> 03:18.780
when the solution to traffic topped the UK. And if the day ever comes where something

03:18.780 --> 03:21.480
newer beats out traffic, I will be thrilled again.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.120
Is there an underlying theme that connects all your videos? Not really. My YouTube colleagues

03:25.120 --> 03:29.380
are forever telling me to be more strategic in the selection of topics, to target content

03:29.380 --> 03:35.740
for growth and views and dolla dolla bills. And I know I should, but I just kind of can't.

03:35.740 --> 03:39.260
Because the videos take so long from idea to completion, the only thing that really

03:39.260 --> 03:43.140
matters is a topic that I can stay interested in for months, and that just doesn't work

03:43.140 --> 03:47.800
for me with strategic selection or trying to have an underlying theme. But I guess if

03:47.800 --> 03:51.760
you're looking for what's similar with all the videos, one human personality slider is

03:51.760 --> 03:55.520
how much you are interested in things versus how much you are interested in people. Most

03:55.520 --> 03:59.240
people are people people, but if you look at my videos, one common connector is the

03:59.240 --> 04:04.260
near-complete dearth of people. What holds my interest tends to be very thing-oriented.

04:04.260 --> 04:07.240
How does it feel to have teenagers that have been watching your content for the majority

04:07.240 --> 04:12.000
of their life? I hadn't thought about that possibility until now, but if there are people

04:12.000 --> 04:17.380
who have watched my videos for the majority of their life, say hi in the comments. What

04:17.380 --> 04:21.860
do you think about the To My Future Me letters or videos? Have you ever made any? Lots of

04:21.860 --> 04:26.240
people ask questions about sending letters forward or backward in time. I wouldn't want

04:26.240 --> 04:30.400
to mess with the timeline going backward, and sending letters forward is boring, which

04:30.400 --> 04:34.080
is why I've never done that sort of thing. Okay, well actually that's not true, no. One

04:34.080 --> 04:38.580
of my teachers in school had us do this to write a letter to ourselves for when we graduated

04:38.580 --> 04:43.300
high school, and when I got it, high school me did not care about anything grade school

04:43.300 --> 04:48.980
me had to say. And so it goes now. I'm confident that ten years from now me would be positively

04:48.980 --> 04:53.300
meh to get a letter from current me, in the same way current me couldn't be more meh about

04:53.300 --> 04:57.380
what ten years ago me thought about anything. What was your closest experience to death

04:57.380 --> 05:01.340
this decade? The nighttime driving that I did in my road trip video. I was at that point

05:01.340 --> 05:05.780
years out of practice driving, I hadn't slept well the night before and had already driven

05:05.780 --> 05:10.380
all day and then attempted to tackle both a super fast highway and then a pretty sketchy

05:10.380 --> 05:14.340
road. Statistically, it is without doubt the most dangerous thing I've done in the last

05:14.340 --> 05:19.140
ten years. Even though people watch the video and go, what's the dumb dangerous decision

05:19.140 --> 05:24.800
he hyped up at the beginning? Driving at nighttime? LOL lame. But the reality of death is banality,

05:24.800 --> 05:30.100
and it's not always visually obvious when death is close. For example, I was on an Indian

05:30.100 --> 05:35.600
reservation for a project exploring a canyon and filming, and it was until a few days later

05:35.600 --> 05:39.880
when reviewing the footage that I saw the solid ground I was standing on was actually

05:39.880 --> 05:44.780
a bit of an overhang. It didn't fall, obviously, but it's going to fall at some point. And

05:44.780 --> 05:49.300
had it done so, well, the reservation was off the main path and the canyon off the path

05:49.300 --> 05:53.960
from that and the path I was on was off the path in the canyon. So an untimely crack would

05:53.960 --> 05:57.680
doubtlessly have been game over. It's been suggested that you've developed an increased

05:57.680 --> 06:02.160
caffeine dependence over the years. At this point, do you consider it an asset or an addiction?

06:03.120 --> 06:06.880
If you had to categorize your YouTube career into eras, how would you split it? I feel

06:06.880 --> 06:10.980
like that's more for the audience to decide what is, for them, the blue period of grey

06:10.980 --> 06:15.320
or whatever, because the public perception of creation can often have very little to

06:15.320 --> 06:19.960
do with the perception or intention of the creator. Again, human communication is difficult

06:19.960 --> 06:24.380
and also art is not the artist. But for me, there's really only one important era shift,

06:24.380 --> 06:29.140
and that's pre-Project Liberty and post-Project Liberty, which was, wait for it, the Statue

06:29.140 --> 06:34.080
of Liberty video. Which I think almost no viewer would pick out as a big deal video,

06:34.080 --> 06:38.680
but to me, it's the biggest. It's the video where I feel like I finally got my own writing

06:38.680 --> 06:43.200
process, personally accepting its advantages and disadvantages. That may sound strange

06:43.200 --> 06:47.840
because I'd been writing videos for seven years at that point, but I think this is just

06:47.840 --> 06:52.420
part of what happens when you do something for a long time. Is the 10-year mark an accomplishment

06:52.420 --> 06:57.080
or a reminder of the inescapable passage of time? Porque no los dos. How has the way you

06:57.080 --> 07:01.380
spend your free time changed over the last 10 years? Two clear trend lines. Video games

07:01.380 --> 07:05.860
up, books down. I've learned there's a huge number of books I just can't read because

07:05.860 --> 07:09.980
I'll want to turn them into videos and I can read books faster than I can make videos,

07:09.980 --> 07:14.220
so reading those would be just creating a huge pile of guilt for myself. And when your

07:14.220 --> 07:18.860
job is mostly writing and reading, it's nice to turn that off, and video games are basically

07:18.860 --> 07:23.140
the only thing in my life that truly shifts my brain into neutral. All that said, I think

07:23.140 --> 07:28.000
that Droppin' Books has gone too far in the last, eh, five years? I don't like making

07:28.000 --> 07:32.120
promises or predictions for my future self, but one of the things I'd like to be able

07:32.120 --> 07:36.800
to say ten years from now is that I've inflected the reading curve. Who is sponsoring this

07:36.800 --> 07:42.080
video? The most frightening video I uploaded this decade was the one where I asked you

07:42.080 --> 07:47.320
to support the channel directly through membership instead of having sponsors. Clicking upload

07:47.320 --> 07:52.240
that day, I didn't know what would happen, but I trusted in you, and since then together

07:52.240 --> 07:56.880
we have learned the trouble with tumbleweed after flying across an ocean, we've talked

07:56.880 --> 08:03.260
like a pirate, gone through the ticoi trilogy together, and of course revealed the perfectagon

08:03.260 --> 08:08.760
of the hexagon and more. It is you who let each video flow from start to finish without

08:08.760 --> 08:13.380
me needing to pause and tell you about our sponsor in the middle. It is you who supports

08:13.380 --> 08:18.300
me, my family, and my team. It's you who allows me to explore the forest of all knowledge

08:18.300 --> 08:24.020
and share what I've found. You sponsor my videos. And thank you. Thank you for everything,

08:24.020 --> 08:28.140
internet. Thank you for my whole life. It's been a wild ten years.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.300
You
