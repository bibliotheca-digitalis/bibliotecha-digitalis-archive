00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Hello, internet. Well, here we are. One decade later.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,900
Ten years? Now you've got YouTube tenure. I wish that was how it worked, but it is not.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,280
Has it felt like ten years? No, YouTube still feels like my new job, even though I've put

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,400
in almost twice as many YouTube years as teaching years at this point. What can I say? Brains

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,180
are weird.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,060
Can we get a lava lamp on the desk, please? Sure. Actually, back when I was a teacher

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,100
I always kept a lava lamp on the desk for students, because when I was a student I always

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,980
found it easier to listen and to think without also having to make eye contact the whole

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,740
time, but you'd get chastised for looking up at the ceiling. Hey, pay attention, kid.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:48,980
But I was paying attention. Look at me, in the eyes, all day long. Not fun. I figured

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,300
I couldn't be the only one like that, so I didn't correct kids for looking away from

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,060
me. But also, ceiling gets boring after 13 years of compulsory schooling. Thus came onto

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,280
my desk the endlessly hypnotizing lava lamp as focal point. If you're a teacher watching

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,540
this, give it a try. It's good for a certain kind of student, and really chills the vibe

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,100
of the room, man.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,820
Do you think the next ten years will be better or worse for humanity, and more or less impactful

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,680
on human history than the previous ten years? Thinking about impact over the long run of

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,060
human history, it's pretty clear that impact tracks with tech and tech with time. Ten thousand

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,900
years ago, there was very little you could do to impact the world. So I do expect the

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,020
next ten years will be more impactful than the last, and I will bet they're better than

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,620
the last. I'm less confident about that second part than I used to be, but I still think

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,100
it holds that, on average, each decade is an improvement. That is, until we accidentally

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,740
stumble into an existential threat, which is game over. Which is pretty... pretty bad.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,820
Over the last ten years, your channel has grown a lot. What is the most important thing

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,640
that you've learned about creating content? If there's anything I've learned from thousands

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,360
of spoken words, it's that human communication is hard. Way harder than people think, precisely

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,800
because people think it's easy. You just say the words, and the other person hears them,

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,560
and bam! Understanding. Alas, no. Words are fuzzy things, and you don't realize how poorly

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,000
you string them together until you are forced to listen to yourself saying those words.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
And even if you're happy with your string of words, you just don't know how those fuzzy

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,080
patterns of sound will pattern match in someone else's brain. Human communication is a dance,

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,840
and a dance requires partners. We all create content, and I think we should all keep that

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,840
in mind and be much more willing to work with the intended intention of our interlocutors.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,240
What do you miss about internet culture from when you started on YouTube? This is my biggest

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,860
I-liked-that-band-before-they-were-popular opinion, but it finally dawned on me recently

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,340
that internet culture is the culture now. Even just two Q&As ago, I showed the internet

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,480
as the Wild West, but those days are long gone, thrust aside by content mines or suburbs

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,140
with homeowners' associations fixated on real estate values. I think Past Gray was

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,400
super naive to imagine the internet he loved could possibly both 1. explode in size, and

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,240
2. remain the frontier. How do you feel that your number one most-watched video is no longer

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,000
your UK explained video? Fantastic. I thought that UK video would forever be my albatross.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,920
Like, oh, he never did anything as popular as the first thing he did. So I was very happy

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,780
when the solution to traffic topped the UK. And if the day ever comes where something

44
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,480
newer beats out traffic, I will be thrilled again.

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,120
Is there an underlying theme that connects all your videos? Not really. My YouTube colleagues

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,380
are forever telling me to be more strategic in the selection of topics, to target content

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,740
for growth and views and dolla dolla bills. And I know I should, but I just kind of can't.

48
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,260
Because the videos take so long from idea to completion, the only thing that really

49
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,140
matters is a topic that I can stay interested in for months, and that just doesn't work

50
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,800
for me with strategic selection or trying to have an underlying theme. But I guess if

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,760
you're looking for what's similar with all the videos, one human personality slider is

52
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,520
how much you are interested in things versus how much you are interested in people. Most

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,240
people are people people, but if you look at my videos, one common connector is the

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,260
near-complete dearth of people. What holds my interest tends to be very thing-oriented.

55
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,240
How does it feel to have teenagers that have been watching your content for the majority

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,000
of their life? I hadn't thought about that possibility until now, but if there are people

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,380
who have watched my videos for the majority of their life, say hi in the comments. What

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,860
do you think about the To My Future Me letters or videos? Have you ever made any? Lots of

59
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,240
people ask questions about sending letters forward or backward in time. I wouldn't want

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
to mess with the timeline going backward, and sending letters forward is boring, which

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,080
is why I've never done that sort of thing. Okay, well actually that's not true, no. One

62
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,580
of my teachers in school had us do this to write a letter to ourselves for when we graduated

63
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,300
high school, and when I got it, high school me did not care about anything grade school

64
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,980
me had to say. And so it goes now. I'm confident that ten years from now me would be positively

65
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,300
meh to get a letter from current me, in the same way current me couldn't be more meh about

66
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,380
what ten years ago me thought about anything. What was your closest experience to death

67
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,340
this decade? The nighttime driving that I did in my road trip video. I was at that point

68
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,780
years out of practice driving, I hadn't slept well the night before and had already driven

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,380
all day and then attempted to tackle both a super fast highway and then a pretty sketchy

70
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,340
road. Statistically, it is without doubt the most dangerous thing I've done in the last

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,140
ten years. Even though people watch the video and go, what's the dumb dangerous decision

72
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,800
he hyped up at the beginning? Driving at nighttime? LOL lame. But the reality of death is banality,

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,100
and it's not always visually obvious when death is close. For example, I was on an Indian

74
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,600
reservation for a project exploring a canyon and filming, and it was until a few days later

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,880
when reviewing the footage that I saw the solid ground I was standing on was actually

76
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,780
a bit of an overhang. It didn't fall, obviously, but it's going to fall at some point. And

77
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,300
had it done so, well, the reservation was off the main path and the canyon off the path

78
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,960
from that and the path I was on was off the path in the canyon. So an untimely crack would

79
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,680
doubtlessly have been game over. It's been suggested that you've developed an increased

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
caffeine dependence over the years. At this point, do you consider it an asset or an addiction?

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,880
If you had to categorize your YouTube career into eras, how would you split it? I feel

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,980
like that's more for the audience to decide what is, for them, the blue period of grey

83
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,320
or whatever, because the public perception of creation can often have very little to

84
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,960
do with the perception or intention of the creator. Again, human communication is difficult

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,380
and also art is not the artist. But for me, there's really only one important era shift,

86
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,140
and that's pre-Project Liberty and post-Project Liberty, which was, wait for it, the Statue

87
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,080
of Liberty video. Which I think almost no viewer would pick out as a big deal video,

88
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,680
but to me, it's the biggest. It's the video where I feel like I finally got my own writing

89
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,200
process, personally accepting its advantages and disadvantages. That may sound strange

90
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,840
because I'd been writing videos for seven years at that point, but I think this is just

91
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,420
part of what happens when you do something for a long time. Is the 10-year mark an accomplishment

92
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,080
or a reminder of the inescapable passage of time? Porque no los dos. How has the way you

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,380
spend your free time changed over the last 10 years? Two clear trend lines. Video games

94
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,860
up, books down. I've learned there's a huge number of books I just can't read because

95
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,980
I'll want to turn them into videos and I can read books faster than I can make videos,

96
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,220
so reading those would be just creating a huge pile of guilt for myself. And when your

97
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,860
job is mostly writing and reading, it's nice to turn that off, and video games are basically

98
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,140
the only thing in my life that truly shifts my brain into neutral. All that said, I think

99
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,000
that Droppin' Books has gone too far in the last, eh, five years? I don't like making

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,120
promises or predictions for my future self, but one of the things I'd like to be able

101
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,800
to say ten years from now is that I've inflected the reading curve. Who is sponsoring this

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,080
video? The most frightening video I uploaded this decade was the one where I asked you

103
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,320
to support the channel directly through membership instead of having sponsors. Clicking upload

104
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,240
that day, I didn't know what would happen, but I trusted in you, and since then together

105
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,880
we have learned the trouble with tumbleweed after flying across an ocean, we've talked

106
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,260
like a pirate, gone through the ticoi trilogy together, and of course revealed the perfectagon

107
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,760
of the hexagon and more. It is you who let each video flow from start to finish without

108
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,380
me needing to pause and tell you about our sponsor in the middle. It is you who supports

109
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,300
me, my family, and my team. It's you who allows me to explore the forest of all knowledge

110
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,020
and share what I've found. You sponsor my videos. And thank you. Thank you for everything,

111
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,140
internet. Thank you for my whole life. It's been a wild ten years.

112
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
You
