00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
The Lord of the Rings has lots of different kinds of people.

00:02.600 --> 00:06.400
Elven people, dwarven people, tree people, half-sized people, even people people.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.300
There's like a million pages of background explaining this world that goes much deeper than the books or the movies.

00:11.300 --> 00:15.400
But if you don't want to read it all, here's a four-minute summary, starting with wizards.

00:15.400 --> 00:22.500
It's easy to mistake the wizards as humans trained in magic, like elsewhere, but in The Lord of the Rings wizards are low-ish level angels.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.500
They're called Istari, get ready for lots of names in this video, and there are five of them.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.700
Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, and the two blue wizards.

00:30.700 --> 00:35.400
Their power comes mostly from being supernatural and not so much from book learning.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.000
They're sent, by who, we'll get to that in a second, to help the people of the world stand against evil.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Not wildly successfully either.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.300
Saruman, the leader of the five with a mind of metal and wheels, gets corrupted,

00:45.300 --> 00:47.600
Radagast gets distracted by all the pretty nature,

00:47.600 --> 00:51.900
the blue wizards just kind of fade into the east, possibly starting cults of magic,

00:51.900 --> 00:54.500
and it's only Gandalf that stays true to the quest.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.900
Now, where there's angels, there's a god, and in this universe, that's Eru Iluvatar.

00:58.900 --> 01:03.400
In the beginning, there was naught but Eru and the infinite timeless nothing, which is rather boring,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.000
so he created lots of angels to keep him company.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.300
Iluvatar's angels are called the Ainur and are divided into two groups.

01:09.300 --> 01:14.900
The Valar, guardians of the world, of which there are 14, or 15, depending on who you want to count, and their servants the Maiar.

01:14.900 --> 01:20.000
So, the wizards are the Istari, a subset of the Maiar, which serve the Valar, all created by Iluvatar.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.300
Iluvatar and all his angels sang together to make the world.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.600
The harmony started out great, but there was one Valar named Melkor,

01:26.600 --> 01:30.300
and just from the name Melkor, you know what's going to happen,

01:30.300 --> 01:35.600
even before learning he's also the smartest, and the most powerful of the angels, and also a bit of a loner.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.200
Melkor didn't want just to be part of the chorus like his dimmer Valar co-workers,

01:39.200 --> 01:43.800
he wanted his own song and creations, and so his voice became discordant from the others,

01:43.800 --> 01:46.300
and created all the suffering and evil in the world.

01:46.300 --> 01:50.000
But Melkor's song also attracted some Maiar to his side, including the Balrogs,

01:50.000 --> 01:56.300
which means the Balrog is a low-level angel, making him on the same level of the power org chart as Gandalf,

01:56.300 --> 02:00.700
which explains why an old man can hold his ground against a giant lava monster.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.400
Through his discordant singing, Melkor also created some of the evil creatures in the world,

02:04.400 --> 02:08.700
such as the dragons and trolls, which finally gets us to things that aren't angels.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.700
Other Valar also made their own non-angelic creations, though in a more cooperative spirit with Iluvatar.

02:13.700 --> 02:20.100
Manwe makes the great eagles, Aule made the dwarves, and his wife Janava made all of the animals and plants in the world,

02:20.100 --> 02:24.700
before capping off that minor task with the Ents, her own race of sentient creatures.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.200
While Iluvatar seemed happy to leave it to his Valar to make most of this stuff,

02:28.200 --> 02:34.200
he did personally create men and elves, which makes them special and kind of above all the other living creatures.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.200
Sorry dwarves.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.900
And of these two, the men are Iluvatar's favorite children,

02:38.900 --> 02:44.800
and he shows this by giving men shorter lives than everybody else and also the gift of death.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.900
Thanks a lot, dad.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.300
But their short lives set them apart from the other creatures,

02:48.300 --> 02:52.200
and they aren't tied to the music of creation and the world like everyone else,

02:52.200 --> 02:54.800
and so are able to forge their own futures.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.400
These qualities make them the get-stuff-done species of Middle-earth.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.000
Elves, on the other hand, are so connected to the world they're practically made of nature,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.100
same with the dwarves in their own way and the Ents, of course.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.700
These species all but follow the flow of nature,

03:08.700 --> 03:13.200
and it's partly why the humans have such a hard time getting them to do anything,

03:13.200 --> 03:16.500
even when faced with armies of orcs, which brings us to orcs.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.400
Melkor was powerful but couldn't make his own creatures as great as the elves and men,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.800
and so cheated by corrupting some of them in the beginning

03:22.800 --> 03:26.600
and selectively breeding them over the generations into these creatures.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.000
This business Melkor was up to of torturing elves, making monsters,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.300
recruiting angels from the other side eventually, but unsurprisingly,

03:33.300 --> 03:37.100
led to a war that Melkor loses and got him banished into the void.

03:37.100 --> 03:43.200
All of the conflict in The Lord of the Rings comes long after the epic good-versus-evil fight of that universe.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.500
Sauron the big bad who caused all of the trouble in these books was just one of the Maiar,

03:47.500 --> 03:51.900
though an unusually powerful one, who started his career as Melkor's lieutenant.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.400
After the war, he did make a ring to focus his strength, but that's a story for another time.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.600
Last but not least, we have the hobbits.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.400
Even though they seem related to dwarves, what with the living underground and the vertical challenge,

04:02.400 --> 04:04.100
hobbits are a subspecies of men.

04:04.100 --> 04:08.100
For such an important and pivotal race, there is little written of their origin other than the phrase

04:08.100 --> 04:12.600
related to men. Turns out, with a million pages, you still can't talk about everything,

04:12.600 --> 04:14.600
just like in a four-minute video.
