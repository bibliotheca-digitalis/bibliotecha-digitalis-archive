00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
The Lord of the Rings has lots of different kinds of people.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,400
Elven people, dwarven people, tree people, half-sized people, even people people.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,300
There's like a million pages of background explaining this world that goes much deeper than the books or the movies.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,400
But if you don't want to read it all, here's a four-minute summary, starting with wizards.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,500
It's easy to mistake the wizards as humans trained in magic, like elsewhere, but in The Lord of the Rings wizards are low-ish level angels.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
They're called Istari, get ready for lots of names in this video, and there are five of them.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,700
Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, and the two blue wizards.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Their power comes mostly from being supernatural and not so much from book learning.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,000
They're sent, by who, we'll get to that in a second, to help the people of the world stand against evil.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Not wildly successfully either.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,300
Saruman, the leader of the five with a mind of metal and wheels, gets corrupted,

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,600
Radagast gets distracted by all the pretty nature,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,900
the blue wizards just kind of fade into the east, possibly starting cults of magic,

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,500
and it's only Gandalf that stays true to the quest.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,900
Now, where there's angels, there's a god, and in this universe, that's Eru Iluvatar.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,400
In the beginning, there was naught but Eru and the infinite timeless nothing, which is rather boring,

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,000
so he created lots of angels to keep him company.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,300
Iluvatar's angels are called the Ainur and are divided into two groups.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,900
The Valar, guardians of the world, of which there are 14, or 15, depending on who you want to count, and their servants the Maiar.

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,000
So, the wizards are the Istari, a subset of the Maiar, which serve the Valar, all created by Iluvatar.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,300
Iluvatar and all his angels sang together to make the world.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,600
The harmony started out great, but there was one Valar named Melkor,

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,300
and just from the name Melkor, you know what's going to happen,

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,600
even before learning he's also the smartest, and the most powerful of the angels, and also a bit of a loner.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
Melkor didn't want just to be part of the chorus like his dimmer Valar co-workers,

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,800
he wanted his own song and creations, and so his voice became discordant from the others,

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,300
and created all the suffering and evil in the world.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,000
But Melkor's song also attracted some Maiar to his side, including the Balrogs,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,300
which means the Balrog is a low-level angel, making him on the same level of the power org chart as Gandalf,

30
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,700
which explains why an old man can hold his ground against a giant lava monster.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,400
Through his discordant singing, Melkor also created some of the evil creatures in the world,

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,700
such as the dragons and trolls, which finally gets us to things that aren't angels.

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Other Valar also made their own non-angelic creations, though in a more cooperative spirit with Iluvatar.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,100
Manwe makes the great eagles, Aule made the dwarves, and his wife Janava made all of the animals and plants in the world,

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,700
before capping off that minor task with the Ents, her own race of sentient creatures.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,200
While Iluvatar seemed happy to leave it to his Valar to make most of this stuff,

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,200
he did personally create men and elves, which makes them special and kind of above all the other living creatures.

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Sorry dwarves.

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,900
And of these two, the men are Iluvatar's favorite children,

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,800
and he shows this by giving men shorter lives than everybody else and also the gift of death.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,900
Thanks a lot, dad.

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,300
But their short lives set them apart from the other creatures,

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,200
and they aren't tied to the music of creation and the world like everyone else,

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
and so are able to forge their own futures.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
These qualities make them the get-stuff-done species of Middle-earth.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Elves, on the other hand, are so connected to the world they're practically made of nature,

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,100
same with the dwarves in their own way and the Ents, of course.

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,700
These species all but follow the flow of nature,

49
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,200
and it's partly why the humans have such a hard time getting them to do anything,

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,500
even when faced with armies of orcs, which brings us to orcs.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,400
Melkor was powerful but couldn't make his own creatures as great as the elves and men,

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
and so cheated by corrupting some of them in the beginning

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,600
and selectively breeding them over the generations into these creatures.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,000
This business Melkor was up to of torturing elves, making monsters,

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
recruiting angels from the other side eventually, but unsurprisingly,

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,100
led to a war that Melkor loses and got him banished into the void.

57
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,200
All of the conflict in The Lord of the Rings comes long after the epic good-versus-evil fight of that universe.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,500
Sauron the big bad who caused all of the trouble in these books was just one of the Maiar,

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,900
though an unusually powerful one, who started his career as Melkor's lieutenant.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,400
After the war, he did make a ring to focus his strength, but that's a story for another time.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
Last but not least, we have the hobbits.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Even though they seem related to dwarves, what with the living underground and the vertical challenge,

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,100
hobbits are a subspecies of men.

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,100
For such an important and pivotal race, there is little written of their origin other than the phrase

65
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,600
related to men. Turns out, with a million pages, you still can't talk about everything,

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
just like in a four-minute video.
