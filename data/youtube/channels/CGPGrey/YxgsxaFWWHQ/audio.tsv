0	2600	The Lord of the Rings has lots of different kinds of people.
2600	6400	Elven people, dwarven people, tree people, half-sized people, even people people.
6400	11300	There's like a million pages of background explaining this world that goes much deeper than the books or the movies.
11300	15400	But if you don't want to read it all, here's a four-minute summary, starting with wizards.
15400	22500	It's easy to mistake the wizards as humans trained in magic, like elsewhere, but in The Lord of the Rings wizards are low-ish level angels.
22500	26500	They're called Istari, get ready for lots of names in this video, and there are five of them.
26500	30700	Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, and the two blue wizards.
30700	35400	Their power comes mostly from being supernatural and not so much from book learning.
35400	40000	They're sent, by who, we'll get to that in a second, to help the people of the world stand against evil.
40000	42000	Not wildly successfully either.
42000	45300	Saruman, the leader of the five with a mind of metal and wheels, gets corrupted,
45300	47600	Radagast gets distracted by all the pretty nature,
47600	51900	the blue wizards just kind of fade into the east, possibly starting cults of magic,
51900	54500	and it's only Gandalf that stays true to the quest.
54500	58900	Now, where there's angels, there's a god, and in this universe, that's Eru Iluvatar.
58900	63400	In the beginning, there was naught but Eru and the infinite timeless nothing, which is rather boring,
63400	66000	so he created lots of angels to keep him company.
66000	69300	Iluvatar's angels are called the Ainur and are divided into two groups.
69300	74900	The Valar, guardians of the world, of which there are 14, or 15, depending on who you want to count, and their servants the Maiar.
74900	80000	So, the wizards are the Istari, a subset of the Maiar, which serve the Valar, all created by Iluvatar.
80000	83300	Iluvatar and all his angels sang together to make the world.
83300	86600	The harmony started out great, but there was one Valar named Melkor,
86600	90300	and just from the name Melkor, you know what's going to happen,
90300	95600	even before learning he's also the smartest, and the most powerful of the angels, and also a bit of a loner.
95600	99200	Melkor didn't want just to be part of the chorus like his dimmer Valar co-workers,
99200	103800	he wanted his own song and creations, and so his voice became discordant from the others,
103800	106300	and created all the suffering and evil in the world.
106300	110000	But Melkor's song also attracted some Maiar to his side, including the Balrogs,
110000	116300	which means the Balrog is a low-level angel, making him on the same level of the power org chart as Gandalf,
116300	120700	which explains why an old man can hold his ground against a giant lava monster.
120700	124400	Through his discordant singing, Melkor also created some of the evil creatures in the world,
124400	128700	such as the dragons and trolls, which finally gets us to things that aren't angels.
128700	133700	Other Valar also made their own non-angelic creations, though in a more cooperative spirit with Iluvatar.
133700	140100	Manwe makes the great eagles, Aule made the dwarves, and his wife Janava made all of the animals and plants in the world,
140100	144700	before capping off that minor task with the Ents, her own race of sentient creatures.
144700	148200	While Iluvatar seemed happy to leave it to his Valar to make most of this stuff,
148200	154200	he did personally create men and elves, which makes them special and kind of above all the other living creatures.
154200	155200	Sorry dwarves.
155200	158900	And of these two, the men are Iluvatar's favorite children,
158900	164800	and he shows this by giving men shorter lives than everybody else and also the gift of death.
164800	165900	Thanks a lot, dad.
165900	168300	But their short lives set them apart from the other creatures,
168300	172200	and they aren't tied to the music of creation and the world like everyone else,
172200	174800	and so are able to forge their own futures.
174800	178400	These qualities make them the get-stuff-done species of Middle-earth.
178400	183000	Elves, on the other hand, are so connected to the world they're practically made of nature,
183000	186100	same with the dwarves in their own way and the Ents, of course.
186100	188700	These species all but follow the flow of nature,
188700	193200	and it's partly why the humans have such a hard time getting them to do anything,
193200	196500	even when faced with armies of orcs, which brings us to orcs.
196500	200400	Melkor was powerful but couldn't make his own creatures as great as the elves and men,
200400	202800	and so cheated by corrupting some of them in the beginning
202800	206600	and selectively breeding them over the generations into these creatures.
206600	210000	This business Melkor was up to of torturing elves, making monsters,
210000	213300	recruiting angels from the other side eventually, but unsurprisingly,
213300	217100	led to a war that Melkor loses and got him banished into the void.
217100	223200	All of the conflict in The Lord of the Rings comes long after the epic good-versus-evil fight of that universe.
223200	227500	Sauron the big bad who caused all of the trouble in these books was just one of the Maiar,
227500	231900	though an unusually powerful one, who started his career as Melkor's lieutenant.
231900	236400	After the war, he did make a ring to focus his strength, but that's a story for another time.
236400	238600	Last but not least, we have the hobbits.
238600	242400	Even though they seem related to dwarves, what with the living underground and the vertical challenge,
242400	244100	hobbits are a subspecies of men.
244100	248100	For such an important and pivotal race, there is little written of their origin other than the phrase
248100	252600	related to men. Turns out, with a million pages, you still can't talk about everything,
252600	254600	just like in a four-minute video.
