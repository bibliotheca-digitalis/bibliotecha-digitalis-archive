00:00.000 --> 00:03.740
Queen Lion is looking to make the elections in her animal kingdom more fair.

00:03.740 --> 00:07.800
Currently, she divides her citizens into ranges, each of which selects one representative to

00:07.800 --> 00:10.800
go to the Jungle Council, which makes laws for the kingdom.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.900
But her citizens are unhappy, and it's easy to see why.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.700
The council is full of monkeys.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.840
Of course, some of her citizens are monkeys, but not all of them.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.740
This council doesn't fairly represent her kingdom.

00:21.740 --> 00:25.480
Queen Lion visits one of the ranges to find out what's wrong and how to fix it.

00:25.480 --> 00:30.640
In this range, there are five monkeys, four tigers, three owls, two lynx, and one buffalo.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.860
One of each runs for representative, and all citizens vote for their own species.

00:34.860 --> 00:38.900
The election rule is that the candidate with the most votes wins, which is the monkey.

00:38.900 --> 00:43.380
But it's a pretty unsatisfying result considering that two-thirds of the citizens in this range

00:43.380 --> 00:45.740
aren't monkeys and wouldn't vote for monkeys.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.240
This is the same across all the ranges of the kingdom.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.020
The monkeys always happen to have more votes than anybody else, so they win all the elections

00:53.020 --> 00:56.020
even though they're a minority of the total population.

00:56.020 --> 01:00.040
Closer inspection reveals that the independent advisors hired to draw the range boundaries

01:00.040 --> 01:03.660
in the first place weren't as independent as they might have appeared.

01:03.660 --> 01:07.620
The result is unhappy citizens who don't trust the Jungle Council to make the fairest laws

01:07.620 --> 01:09.160
for all, quite rightly.

01:09.160 --> 01:13.500
Now Queen Lion wants to maximize the number of citizens happy with the election results.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.180
One way to do that is to abolish the ranges and use a proportional system.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.820
But her citizens want local representatives.

01:19.820 --> 01:24.100
So Queen Lion needs a system that both makes her citizens happier by having a more representative

01:24.100 --> 01:27.220
council while keeping the local elections in place.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.900
After doing a little research, she finds out how.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.640
Single transferable vote.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.340
The big change with STV is that ranges send more than one representative, which may seem

01:36.340 --> 01:38.820
weird, but Queen Lion decides to test it out.

01:38.820 --> 01:42.660
She takes three ranges which used to each send one representative and combines them

01:42.660 --> 01:45.380
into one bigger range that will send three.

01:45.380 --> 01:49.740
On election day, citizens go to the polls and the results in this new range are just

01:49.740 --> 01:52.040
the same as they were in the old ranges.

01:52.040 --> 01:56.700
So nothing seems better, but with STV to figure out the winners, take the total votes and

01:56.700 --> 02:02.180
divide them by the number of representatives needed, in this case three, which gives 33%

02:02.180 --> 02:04.560
as the amount a candidate needs to win.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.920
So all three candidates go to the council, which accurately represents the citizens in

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
the range.

02:09.920 --> 02:13.880
Whereas under the old system, each individual range would have sent a monkey, leaving two

02:13.880 --> 02:16.320
thirds of the citizens without representation.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.600
A bigger range with multiple winners allows the results to be more proportional.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.880
This test turned out well, but it was also as simple as could be.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.880
Now Queen Lion wants to see what happens in a race where not everybody is a winner.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.280
The next big range she tests has five candidates running for office.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.260
Gorilla, Tarsier, Monkey, Tiger, and Lynx, three of which can be representatives.

02:36.260 --> 02:40.320
Election day comes and goes and here are the results of the citizens' first choices.

02:40.320 --> 02:47.720
Tarsier gets 5%, Gorilla gets 28%, Monkey gets 33%, Tiger gets 21%, and Lynx gets 13%.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.900
As before, a candidate needs 33% to win.

02:50.900 --> 02:55.060
Monkey has that and so is immediately selected as one of the three representatives.

02:55.060 --> 02:59.680
But no one else reached the winning 33%, so how are the other two representatives selected?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.800
Step one, get rid of the biggest loser.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.480
Sorry Tarsier, you really had no chance at all.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.040
When the citizens voted, they could have just put an X next to the candidate they liked

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
best.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.480
But with STV, they can also rank their favorite candidates.

03:12.480 --> 03:17.000
This is important because it shows how the election would have turned out if one of the

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
candidates hadn't run.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.720
Tiny and worried Tarsiers would have voted for the big calm Gorilla without Tarsier in

03:22.720 --> 03:23.720
the race.

03:23.720 --> 03:28.040
So if their candidate can't win, they want their votes to go to the Gorilla instead.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.480
This pushes Gorilla up to 33% and he becomes the next representative.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.640
Ranking allows citizens to support their favorite candidate without worrying.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.800
There's no point in strategizing about how everyone else is going to vote.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.080
The system works to maximize voter happiness with the result.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.080
Now back to the range.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.600
There's still one representative to select, so the next biggest loser is Lynx.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.160
His voters don't like Simeon's, but they do think Tiger's interests are similar to theirs

03:50.160 --> 03:53.440
and so if Lynx can't win, they want Tiger to get their votes.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.260
He reaches 33% and becomes the third and final representative.

03:57.260 --> 04:01.600
The election results look pretty good, especially considering the citizens' first and second

04:01.600 --> 04:02.600
choices.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.560
Citizens also have a local representative they can feel comfortable approaching, whereas

04:06.560 --> 04:09.240
using the old system, everybody gets a monkey.

04:09.240 --> 04:13.520
Lastly, Queenline wants to know what happens in a range with just two political parties.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.080
Under the most votes win system, multiple candidates from the same party would be a

04:17.080 --> 04:18.080
disaster.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.000
They'd split their voters and hand the win to their opposition.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.400
Queenline makes one last test range with two thirds Tiger's and one third Gorilla's that,

04:25.400 --> 04:28.000
as before, needs three representatives.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.140
Because citizens rank their candidates under STV, there can be more than one candidate

04:32.180 --> 04:36.340
from the same party running at the same time without any problems.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.980
The Tiger's run two candidates, as do the Gorilla's.

04:38.980 --> 04:43.700
On election day, White Tiger gets a massive amount of first choice votes, probably because

04:43.700 --> 04:44.820
he's so cool.

04:44.820 --> 04:48.820
Meanwhile, the Gorilla's are split between their new guy and the old silverback.

04:48.820 --> 04:52.900
White Tiger is selected as the first representative, but what happens next?

04:52.900 --> 04:57.040
While Tiger is the biggest loser and it seems like he should be eliminated, it's also obvious

04:57.040 --> 05:01.240
that he would have gotten way more votes if White Tiger wasn't in the race.

05:01.340 --> 05:05.840
If a candidate has more votes than they need, like White Tiger does, the first step is to

05:05.840 --> 05:08.780
give the extra votes to their second choice.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.720
This gets Tiger to 33% and he becomes the next representative.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.280
If that seems strange, there are two things to consider.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.620
If instead the extra votes were ignored and Tiger eliminated, then the Gorilla's would

05:18.620 --> 05:23.640
get the remaining two wins, which would obviously not be representing the range very well.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.380
And ignoring extra votes punishes citizens who back popular candidates, which gets us

05:28.380 --> 05:32.620
back to the problem where voters start thinking about how everyone else will vote rather than

05:32.620 --> 05:34.080
what they really want.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.280
If a candidate is able to get more votes than they really need, then it also means those

05:38.280 --> 05:44.260
who support him are a big section of the population and thus fairly should get more representation.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.260
Right.

05:45.260 --> 05:48.780
After the extra votes go to Tiger, the election finishes as before.

05:48.780 --> 05:52.960
Silverback came in last, is eliminated and his voters' second choice is the younger candidate,

05:52.960 --> 05:54.280
so Gorilla gets in.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.860
And the results look fair.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.880
Greenline has seen STV work.

05:57.880 --> 06:02.100
Whether a range has one party or lots of parties, the process is still always the same.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.420
First, citizens rank their favorite candidates.

06:04.420 --> 06:07.620
Second, any candidate above the threshold wins immediately.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.900
Extra votes then go to their next choice.

06:09.900 --> 06:14.020
If there's no winner, the last place is eliminated and the votes go to their next choice.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.600
Repeat until all the winners are found.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.680
This whole process is designed to maximize the number of citizens who are happy with

06:20.680 --> 06:21.680
the results.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.460
And it gives STV many advantages over the old most-votes-wins system.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.580
Citizens can honestly vote for their favorite candidate without worrying about what everyone

06:29.580 --> 06:30.980
else is going to do.

06:30.980 --> 06:34.400
It's more proportional, so monkeying with the borders matters less.

06:34.400 --> 06:39.200
And almost all citizens will have a local representative they actually voted for.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.960
In the end, Queenline decides to switch the council's elections to single transferable

06:42.960 --> 06:45.720
vote to make a better jungle council for all.
