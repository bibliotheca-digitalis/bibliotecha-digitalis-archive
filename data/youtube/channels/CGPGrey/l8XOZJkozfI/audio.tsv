0	3740	Queen Lion is looking to make the elections in her animal kingdom more fair.
3740	7800	Currently, she divides her citizens into ranges, each of which selects one representative to
7800	10800	go to the Jungle Council, which makes laws for the kingdom.
10800	13900	But her citizens are unhappy, and it's easy to see why.
13900	15700	The council is full of monkeys.
15700	18840	Of course, some of her citizens are monkeys, but not all of them.
18840	21740	This council doesn't fairly represent her kingdom.
21740	25480	Queen Lion visits one of the ranges to find out what's wrong and how to fix it.
25480	30640	In this range, there are five monkeys, four tigers, three owls, two lynx, and one buffalo.
30640	34860	One of each runs for representative, and all citizens vote for their own species.
34860	38900	The election rule is that the candidate with the most votes wins, which is the monkey.
38900	43380	But it's a pretty unsatisfying result considering that two-thirds of the citizens in this range
43380	45740	aren't monkeys and wouldn't vote for monkeys.
45740	48240	This is the same across all the ranges of the kingdom.
48240	53020	The monkeys always happen to have more votes than anybody else, so they win all the elections
53020	56020	even though they're a minority of the total population.
56020	60040	Closer inspection reveals that the independent advisors hired to draw the range boundaries
60040	63660	in the first place weren't as independent as they might have appeared.
63660	67620	The result is unhappy citizens who don't trust the Jungle Council to make the fairest laws
67620	69160	for all, quite rightly.
69160	73500	Now Queen Lion wants to maximize the number of citizens happy with the election results.
73500	77180	One way to do that is to abolish the ranges and use a proportional system.
77180	79820	But her citizens want local representatives.
79820	84100	So Queen Lion needs a system that both makes her citizens happier by having a more representative
84100	87220	council while keeping the local elections in place.
87220	89900	After doing a little research, she finds out how.
89900	91640	Single transferable vote.
91640	96340	The big change with STV is that ranges send more than one representative, which may seem
96340	98820	weird, but Queen Lion decides to test it out.
98820	102660	She takes three ranges which used to each send one representative and combines them
102660	105380	into one bigger range that will send three.
105380	109740	On election day, citizens go to the polls and the results in this new range are just
109740	112040	the same as they were in the old ranges.
112040	116700	So nothing seems better, but with STV to figure out the winners, take the total votes and
116700	122180	divide them by the number of representatives needed, in this case three, which gives 33%
122180	124560	as the amount a candidate needs to win.
124560	128920	So all three candidates go to the council, which accurately represents the citizens in
128920	129920	the range.
129920	133880	Whereas under the old system, each individual range would have sent a monkey, leaving two
133880	136320	thirds of the citizens without representation.
136320	140600	A bigger range with multiple winners allows the results to be more proportional.
140600	143880	This test turned out well, but it was also as simple as could be.
143880	147880	Now Queen Lion wants to see what happens in a race where not everybody is a winner.
147880	151280	The next big range she tests has five candidates running for office.
151280	156260	Gorilla, Tarsier, Monkey, Tiger, and Lynx, three of which can be representatives.
156260	160320	Election day comes and goes and here are the results of the citizens' first choices.
160320	167720	Tarsier gets 5%, Gorilla gets 28%, Monkey gets 33%, Tiger gets 21%, and Lynx gets 13%.
167720	170900	As before, a candidate needs 33% to win.
170900	175060	Monkey has that and so is immediately selected as one of the three representatives.
175060	179680	But no one else reached the winning 33%, so how are the other two representatives selected?
179680	181800	Step one, get rid of the biggest loser.
181800	184480	Sorry Tarsier, you really had no chance at all.
184480	188040	When the citizens voted, they could have just put an X next to the candidate they liked
188040	189040	best.
189040	192480	But with STV, they can also rank their favorite candidates.
192480	197000	This is important because it shows how the election would have turned out if one of the
197000	198000	candidates hadn't run.
198000	202720	Tiny and worried Tarsiers would have voted for the big calm Gorilla without Tarsier in
202720	203720	the race.
203720	208040	So if their candidate can't win, they want their votes to go to the Gorilla instead.
208040	212480	This pushes Gorilla up to 33% and he becomes the next representative.
212480	215640	Ranking allows citizens to support their favorite candidate without worrying.
215640	218800	There's no point in strategizing about how everyone else is going to vote.
218800	222080	The system works to maximize voter happiness with the result.
222080	223080	Now back to the range.
223080	226600	There's still one representative to select, so the next biggest loser is Lynx.
226600	230160	His voters don't like Simeon's, but they do think Tiger's interests are similar to theirs
230160	233440	and so if Lynx can't win, they want Tiger to get their votes.
233440	237260	He reaches 33% and becomes the third and final representative.
237260	241600	The election results look pretty good, especially considering the citizens' first and second
241600	242600	choices.
242600	246560	Citizens also have a local representative they can feel comfortable approaching, whereas
246560	249240	using the old system, everybody gets a monkey.
249240	253520	Lastly, Queenline wants to know what happens in a range with just two political parties.
253520	257080	Under the most votes win system, multiple candidates from the same party would be a
257080	258080	disaster.
258080	261000	They'd split their voters and hand the win to their opposition.
261000	265400	Queenline makes one last test range with two thirds Tiger's and one third Gorilla's that,
265400	268000	as before, needs three representatives.
268000	272140	Because citizens rank their candidates under STV, there can be more than one candidate
272180	276340	from the same party running at the same time without any problems.
276340	278980	The Tiger's run two candidates, as do the Gorilla's.
278980	283700	On election day, White Tiger gets a massive amount of first choice votes, probably because
283700	284820	he's so cool.
284820	288820	Meanwhile, the Gorilla's are split between their new guy and the old silverback.
288820	292900	White Tiger is selected as the first representative, but what happens next?
292900	297040	While Tiger is the biggest loser and it seems like he should be eliminated, it's also obvious
297040	301240	that he would have gotten way more votes if White Tiger wasn't in the race.
301340	305840	If a candidate has more votes than they need, like White Tiger does, the first step is to
305840	308780	give the extra votes to their second choice.
308780	312720	This gets Tiger to 33% and he becomes the next representative.
312720	315280	If that seems strange, there are two things to consider.
315280	318620	If instead the extra votes were ignored and Tiger eliminated, then the Gorilla's would
318620	323640	get the remaining two wins, which would obviously not be representing the range very well.
323640	328380	And ignoring extra votes punishes citizens who back popular candidates, which gets us
328380	332620	back to the problem where voters start thinking about how everyone else will vote rather than
332620	334080	what they really want.
334080	338280	If a candidate is able to get more votes than they really need, then it also means those
338280	344260	who support him are a big section of the population and thus fairly should get more representation.
344260	345260	Right.
345260	348780	After the extra votes go to Tiger, the election finishes as before.
348780	352960	Silverback came in last, is eliminated and his voters' second choice is the younger candidate,
352960	354280	so Gorilla gets in.
354280	355860	And the results look fair.
355860	357880	Greenline has seen STV work.
357880	362100	Whether a range has one party or lots of parties, the process is still always the same.
362100	364420	First, citizens rank their favorite candidates.
364420	367620	Second, any candidate above the threshold wins immediately.
367620	369900	Extra votes then go to their next choice.
369900	374020	If there's no winner, the last place is eliminated and the votes go to their next choice.
374020	376600	Repeat until all the winners are found.
376600	380680	This whole process is designed to maximize the number of citizens who are happy with
380680	381680	the results.
381680	386460	And it gives STV many advantages over the old most-votes-wins system.
386460	389580	Citizens can honestly vote for their favorite candidate without worrying about what everyone
389580	390980	else is going to do.
390980	394400	It's more proportional, so monkeying with the borders matters less.
394400	399200	And almost all citizens will have a local representative they actually voted for.
399200	402960	In the end, Queenline decides to switch the council's elections to single transferable
402960	405720	vote to make a better jungle council for all.
