0	1000	Hello internet.
1000	4160	A lot of you sent me this image making the rounds which concerns the Mayan prediction
4160	6720	that the world will end on December 21st, 2012.
6720	9600	The claimants of the Mayan calendar short counted the years because they forgot about
9600	11980	leap days so the world should have already ended.
11980	14960	This is followed by mind equals blown which I'm not sure how to take.
14960	18520	Do people think that the world forgot to have its apocalypse or that were it not for leap
18520	20540	days we'd be already living in the future?
20540	23760	Either way it spawned many an argument and people asked me to explain which I'm happy
23760	27360	to do because my next big video was delayed by Pestilence which struck me down into the
27360	29980	depths of unproductive misery for the last few weeks.
29980	33080	So if you haven't already please watch the related videos now as otherwise this won't
33080	35980	make a whole lot of sense and there are a few corrections I'd like to make.
35980	38840	The first of these is that I shouldn't have called the Mayans Mayans.
38840	42080	Maya is the correct singular and plural noun to use in the same way that sheep is both
42080	43360	singular and plural.
43360	46480	Mayan is the name of the language and the adjective form of the word as in the Mayan
46480	47480	civilization.
47480	50640	Secondly, I showed a picture of the Aztec calendar stone rather than a Mayan calendar
50640	54440	in my 2012 video which at the time I thought was okay because the Aztec calendar is the
54440	58620	same as the Mayan just with different names sort of like the Greek and Roman gods.
58620	62880	And frankly the Aztec one is much cooler looking but I was still wrong to show it because despite
62880	67160	naming it the Aztec calendar stone archaeologists don't actually think it's a calendar.
67160	70920	And speaking of stone I used the term Stone Age to describe the Maya which made many people
70920	72120	very angry.
72120	75520	For clarity Stone Age doesn't mean stupid it's the technological classification of a
75520	78080	civilization limited to stone tools.
78080	80960	Advanced how their astronomy and mathematics were the Maya never discovered metallurgy
80960	85040	and thus couldn't move on to the Bronze Age then the Iron Age then the Diamond Age.
85040	88900	Right enough corrections it's explanation time for this image which raises three questions.
88900	90920	One does the Mayan calendar have leap days?
90920	92760	Two do the Mayan miscount the years?
92760	94600	Three should the world have already ended?
94600	96400	The answer to all of these is no.
96400	100000	To briefly recap leap years exist to stop seasons drifting out of sync with the calendar
100000	103100	a problem that vexed Pope Gregory because every year Easter and Spring were getting
103100	104300	further apart.
104300	107620	To fix this he introduced the modestly named Gregorian calendar with its fancy leap year
107620	110320	rules to keep the seasons and thus the holidays together.
110320	113480	But while Pope Gregory cared about the seasons the ancient Maya did not.
113480	116680	Presumably because where they lived the weather comes in only one season.
116680	118460	Too hot and too humid.
118460	122200	So the Mayan calendar ignores seasons in favor of accurately tracking the days since creation
122200	123360	in the Mayan religion.
123360	125880	This renders leap years an unnecessary complication.
125880	129160	Though the Mayan calendar is no stranger to complication with its cycles within cycles
129160	132660	within cycles within cycles within cycles that, if you're interested, Hank Green can
132660	134320	tell you much more about.
134320	137340	But back to the miscounting claim which comes from our idea that leap days are extra days
137340	139160	which of course they really aren't.
139160	142500	The Gregorian calendar doesn't give people extra days any more than Daylight Saving Time
142500	144080	gives people extra sunlight.
144080	147180	If you transported Pope Gregory a thousand years back in time to meet the Mayan Lady
147180	150540	Shook and then made them count the days until this year's Winter Solstice they'd agree on
150540	153040	that number because they're just counting sunrises.
153040	156480	It's not like Pope Gregory with his clever modern calendar would notice 500 plus days
156480	160080	that the Lady Shook somehow missed, perhaps while distracted by the pain from her thorns
160080	161520	through the tongue routine.
161520	164960	The only thing they would disagree on is what to call that day with Pope Gregory insisting
164960	169040	on December 21st 2012 and Lady Shook preferring the 13th baktun.
169040	172080	So this image is wrong because it's an apples to oranges comparison.
172080	174900	The Mayan calendar doesn't have leap days because it doesn't need them.
174900	178960	It counts days just fine and its long cycle will finish on December 21st 2012 but the
178960	180240	world will still go on.
