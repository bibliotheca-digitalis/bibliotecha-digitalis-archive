Hello internet.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,160
A lot of you sent me this image making the rounds which concerns the Mayan prediction

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,720
that the world will end on December 21st, 2012.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,600
The claimants of the Mayan calendar short counted the years because they forgot about

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,980
leap days so the world should have already ended.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,960
This is followed by mind equals blown which I'm not sure how to take.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,520
Do people think that the world forgot to have its apocalypse or that were it not for leap

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,540
days we'd be already living in the future?

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,760
Either way it spawned many an argument and people asked me to explain which I'm happy

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,360
to do because my next big video was delayed by Pestilence which struck me down into the

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,980
depths of unproductive misery for the last few weeks.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,080
So if you haven't already please watch the related videos now as otherwise this won't

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,980
make a whole lot of sense and there are a few corrections I'd like to make.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,840
The first of these is that I shouldn't have called the Mayans Mayans.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,080
Maya is the correct singular and plural noun to use in the same way that sheep is both

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,360
singular and plural.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
Mayan is the name of the language and the adjective form of the word as in the Mayan

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
civilization.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,640
Secondly, I showed a picture of the Aztec calendar stone rather than a Mayan calendar

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,440
in my 2012 video which at the time I thought was okay because the Aztec calendar is the

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,620
same as the Mayan just with different names sort of like the Greek and Roman gods.

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,880
And frankly the Aztec one is much cooler looking but I was still wrong to show it because despite

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,160
naming it the Aztec calendar stone archaeologists don't actually think it's a calendar.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,920
And speaking of stone I used the term Stone Age to describe the Maya which made many people

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
very angry.

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,520
For clarity Stone Age doesn't mean stupid it's the technological classification of a

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
civilization limited to stone tools.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,960
Advanced how their astronomy and mathematics were the Maya never discovered metallurgy

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,040
and thus couldn't move on to the Bronze Age then the Iron Age then the Diamond Age.

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,900
Right enough corrections it's explanation time for this image which raises three questions.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,920
One does the Mayan calendar have leap days?

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Two do the Mayan miscount the years?

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
Three should the world have already ended?

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,400
The answer to all of these is no.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
To briefly recap leap years exist to stop seasons drifting out of sync with the calendar

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,100
a problem that vexed Pope Gregory because every year Easter and Spring were getting

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,300
further apart.

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,620
To fix this he introduced the modestly named Gregorian calendar with its fancy leap year

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,320
rules to keep the seasons and thus the holidays together.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,480
But while Pope Gregory cared about the seasons the ancient Maya did not.

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,680
Presumably because where they lived the weather comes in only one season.

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,460
Too hot and too humid.

43
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,200
So the Mayan calendar ignores seasons in favor of accurately tracking the days since creation

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
in the Mayan religion.

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,880
This renders leap years an unnecessary complication.

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,160
Though the Mayan calendar is no stranger to complication with its cycles within cycles

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,660
within cycles within cycles within cycles that, if you're interested, Hank Green can

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,320
tell you much more about.

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,340
But back to the miscounting claim which comes from our idea that leap days are extra days

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,160
which of course they really aren't.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,500
The Gregorian calendar doesn't give people extra days any more than Daylight Saving Time

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,080
gives people extra sunlight.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,180
If you transported Pope Gregory a thousand years back in time to meet the Mayan Lady

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,540
Shook and then made them count the days until this year's Winter Solstice they'd agree on

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,040
that number because they're just counting sunrises.

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
It's not like Pope Gregory with his clever modern calendar would notice 500 plus days

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,080
that the Lady Shook somehow missed, perhaps while distracted by the pain from her thorns

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
through the tongue routine.

59
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,960
The only thing they would disagree on is what to call that day with Pope Gregory insisting

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,040
on December 21st 2012 and Lady Shook preferring the 13th baktun.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,080
So this image is wrong because it's an apples to oranges comparison.

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,900
The Mayan calendar doesn't have leap days because it doesn't need them.

63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,960
It counts days just fine and its long cycle will finish on December 21st 2012 but the

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
world will still go on.
