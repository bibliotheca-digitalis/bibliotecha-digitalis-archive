Hello internet.

00:01.000 --> 00:04.160
A lot of you sent me this image making the rounds which concerns the Mayan prediction

00:04.160 --> 00:06.720
that the world will end on December 21st, 2012.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.600
The claimants of the Mayan calendar short counted the years because they forgot about

00:09.600 --> 00:11.980
leap days so the world should have already ended.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.960
This is followed by mind equals blown which I'm not sure how to take.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.520
Do people think that the world forgot to have its apocalypse or that were it not for leap

00:18.520 --> 00:20.540
days we'd be already living in the future?

00:20.540 --> 00:23.760
Either way it spawned many an argument and people asked me to explain which I'm happy

00:23.760 --> 00:27.360
to do because my next big video was delayed by Pestilence which struck me down into the

00:27.360 --> 00:29.980
depths of unproductive misery for the last few weeks.

00:29.980 --> 00:33.080
So if you haven't already please watch the related videos now as otherwise this won't

00:33.080 --> 00:35.980
make a whole lot of sense and there are a few corrections I'd like to make.

00:35.980 --> 00:38.840
The first of these is that I shouldn't have called the Mayans Mayans.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.080
Maya is the correct singular and plural noun to use in the same way that sheep is both

00:42.080 --> 00:43.360
singular and plural.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.480
Mayan is the name of the language and the adjective form of the word as in the Mayan

00:46.480 --> 00:47.480
civilization.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.640
Secondly, I showed a picture of the Aztec calendar stone rather than a Mayan calendar

00:50.640 --> 00:54.440
in my 2012 video which at the time I thought was okay because the Aztec calendar is the

00:54.440 --> 00:58.620
same as the Mayan just with different names sort of like the Greek and Roman gods.

00:58.620 --> 01:02.880
And frankly the Aztec one is much cooler looking but I was still wrong to show it because despite

01:02.880 --> 01:07.160
naming it the Aztec calendar stone archaeologists don't actually think it's a calendar.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.920
And speaking of stone I used the term Stone Age to describe the Maya which made many people

01:10.920 --> 01:12.120
very angry.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.520
For clarity Stone Age doesn't mean stupid it's the technological classification of a

01:15.520 --> 01:18.080
civilization limited to stone tools.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.960
Advanced how their astronomy and mathematics were the Maya never discovered metallurgy

01:20.960 --> 01:25.040
and thus couldn't move on to the Bronze Age then the Iron Age then the Diamond Age.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.900
Right enough corrections it's explanation time for this image which raises three questions.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.920
One does the Mayan calendar have leap days?

01:30.920 --> 01:32.760
Two do the Mayan miscount the years?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.600
Three should the world have already ended?

01:34.600 --> 01:36.400
The answer to all of these is no.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.000
To briefly recap leap years exist to stop seasons drifting out of sync with the calendar

01:40.000 --> 01:43.100
a problem that vexed Pope Gregory because every year Easter and Spring were getting

01:43.100 --> 01:44.300
further apart.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.620
To fix this he introduced the modestly named Gregorian calendar with its fancy leap year

01:47.620 --> 01:50.320
rules to keep the seasons and thus the holidays together.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.480
But while Pope Gregory cared about the seasons the ancient Maya did not.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.680
Presumably because where they lived the weather comes in only one season.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.460
Too hot and too humid.

01:58.460 --> 02:02.200
So the Mayan calendar ignores seasons in favor of accurately tracking the days since creation

02:02.200 --> 02:03.360
in the Mayan religion.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.880
This renders leap years an unnecessary complication.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.160
Though the Mayan calendar is no stranger to complication with its cycles within cycles

02:09.160 --> 02:12.660
within cycles within cycles within cycles that, if you're interested, Hank Green can

02:12.660 --> 02:14.320
tell you much more about.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.340
But back to the miscounting claim which comes from our idea that leap days are extra days

02:17.340 --> 02:19.160
which of course they really aren't.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.500
The Gregorian calendar doesn't give people extra days any more than Daylight Saving Time

02:22.500 --> 02:24.080
gives people extra sunlight.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.180
If you transported Pope Gregory a thousand years back in time to meet the Mayan Lady

02:27.180 --> 02:30.540
Shook and then made them count the days until this year's Winter Solstice they'd agree on

02:30.540 --> 02:33.040
that number because they're just counting sunrises.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.480
It's not like Pope Gregory with his clever modern calendar would notice 500 plus days

02:36.480 --> 02:40.080
that the Lady Shook somehow missed, perhaps while distracted by the pain from her thorns

02:40.080 --> 02:41.520
through the tongue routine.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.960
The only thing they would disagree on is what to call that day with Pope Gregory insisting

02:44.960 --> 02:49.040
on December 21st 2012 and Lady Shook preferring the 13th baktun.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.080
So this image is wrong because it's an apples to oranges comparison.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.900
The Mayan calendar doesn't have leap days because it doesn't need them.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.960
It counts days just fine and its long cycle will finish on December 21st 2012 but the

02:58.960 --> 03:00.240
world will still go on.
