0	4020	Let's say you want to become Pope, head of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over 1
4020	5020	billion faithful.
5020	7000	What requirements must you have for this lofty position?
7000	9680	First, be a Catholic and second, be a man.
9680	13640	Which seems a little thin and while it's technically possible for a regular Sunday Catholic to
13640	18000	become Pope, the last time this happened was essentially never because becoming Pope isn't
18000	19260	like becoming president.
19260	21300	You can't just run for office.
21300	24760	Selecting the Pope is an inside job and the men who do it are the cardinals and while
24760	28800	in theory they can select any Catholic man to become Pope, in practice they prefer to
28800	30040	elevate one of their own.
30040	34480	The last time a non-cardinal became Pope was more than 600 years ago so while it isn't
34480	37800	an official requirement, it's an unofficial official requirement.
37800	41040	Thus in order to become Pope you'll first need to be a cardinal and to do that you need
41040	43600	to start climbing the Catholic corporate ladder.
43600	44600	Step 1.
44600	45600	Become a priest.
45600	48640	Unlike some churches where you can just fill out a form online and poof, ordained, the
48640	51880	Catholic Church treats becoming a priest as a real, you-need-training profession.
51880	56360	So you're going to require a lot of education, usually a college degree in Catholic philosophy
56360	58080	and then a masters in divinity.
58080	62280	In addition to your educational qualifications you must also be a man unmarried and willing
62280	63520	to remain celibate.
63520	66560	If you meet these requirements and have been working with the church then you can be officially
66560	70720	ordained as a priest which basically means you get to run a Catholic Church or work with
70720	72240	another priest who does.
72240	75320	But you want to move onward and to do that you need to take the job of the man who just
75320	76560	made you a priest.
76560	77560	Step 2.
77560	78560	Become a bishop.
78560	79920	Bishops are a much more select group.
79920	84580	While there are about 400,000 Catholic priests worldwide there are only about 5,000 bishops.
84580	88820	While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals from which they oversee a number of local
88820	89820	churches.
89820	93060	To advance your career you must wait for a bishop in your area to be forced into retirement
93060	96940	at age 75 or die sooner than that freeing up space for you.
96940	100060	But you can't just apply because there's already a secret list of potential bishops that's
100060	103420	updated every three years based on who the current bishops in your area think would make
103420	105380	a good replacement for one of their own.
105380	108600	To be on that list, in addition to the obvious requirement of being a pious person, you should
108600	112940	also be at least 35 years old, have been a priest for at least 5 years and have a doctorate
112940	114500	in theology or equivalent.
114500	118140	Assuming you're all these things your name may or may not be on the secret list.
118140	121420	The local bishops then give that list to the Pope's ambassador for your country known as
121420	122940	the Apostolic Nuncio.
122940	126500	The Nuncio picks three priests from the list, does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews
126500	128840	and selects the one he thinks is best.
128840	132460	But it's not over because the Nuncio sends his report to Vatican City and the Congress
132460	135660	of Bishops who work there reviewing potential appointments from around the world.
135660	138500	If the Congress of Bishops doesn't like any of the three candidates they can tell the
138500	141860	Nuncio to start over, returning to the list, picking another three candidates, doing more
141860	143900	research, more interviews and sending off their results.
143900	146760	When the Congress of Bishops is happy with one of the Nuncio's candidates, that name
146760	151240	is given to the Pope who can reject the candidate and start the whole process over.
151240	154860	It shouldn't be a surprise that from vacancy to a bishop's replacement can take months
154860	156520	and on occasion years.
156520	160240	But assuming a bishop in your area retired or died at the right time and you were on
160240	163600	the secret list of good priests and the Nuncio picked you and you made it through his interview
163600	167060	and the Congress of Bishops approved you and the Pope didn't veto you, poof, now you're
167060	168060	a bishop.
168060	169060	But you're still not on top.
169060	171180	The penultimate promotion is step number three.
171180	172180	Become a cardinal.
172180	176060	Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits to match, cardinals are not the bosses of
176060	177060	bishops.
177060	179980	They are bishops just with an additional title and additional responsibilities, the most
179980	182220	notable of which is electing the new pope.
182220	185900	The only way to become a cardinal is to get the current pope to appoint you as one.
185900	189620	And of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever cardinals.
189620	192940	But let's say your ambition doesn't go unnoticed by the pope and he makes you a cardinal.
192940	195900	Now it's time to play the waiting game for his death or retirement.
195900	198420	And with popes, death is vastly more likely.
198420	201560	And either happens, the cardinals under the age of 80 are brought to Vatican City where
201560	204900	they are isolated from the outside world, presumably by taking away their cell phones
204900	206860	and tablets and carrier pigeons.
206860	209260	Once sequestered, the election of a new pope can begin.
209260	212660	These elections are never exactly the same because the ex-pope leaves instructions on
212660	216640	how he wants his replacements to be picked but in general it works like this.
216640	220620	Four times a day the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel to vote and to become pope one of them
220620	222260	must get a two-thirds majority.
222260	226540	There's a big dose of mustn't be too hasty here as the cardinals don't just raise their
226540	230260	hands or use a modern preferential voting system but instead write down one name on
230260	234300	a piece of paper, stand before the altar and say a long latin phrase before officially
234300	235660	casting the ballot.
235660	238820	Once all the cardinals have done this, the votes are counted and then burned.
238820	242380	This is why TV news stations covering the election of pope use super modern HD live
242380	244260	streaming cameras to look at a chimney.
244260	246260	If the smoke is black, no new pope.
246260	250300	The high victory threshold and tediously slow voting process is why it takes so long to
250300	251380	elect a pope.
251380	254740	It's usually at least two weeks of voting, four times a day, six days a week with one
254740	258300	day a week reserved for prayer but the record length is three years.
258300	261900	Assuming you eventually win the support of your fellow cardinals you have one final thing
261900	263460	to do before becoming pope.
263460	264820	Pick yourself a new name.
264820	267980	There's no formal rule and you can name yourself anything you like but it's tradition to take
267980	269580	the name of a previous pope.
269580	272880	Upon the acceptance of your new name the final ballots are burned clean to make the smoke
272880	276380	turn white and announce to the world that a new pope has been selected.
276380	277580	So that's the career path.
277580	280900	Be born into the right half of the population, become one of a billion Catholics, then one
280900	283700	of four hundred thousand priests, then one of five thousand bishops, then one of two
283700	287420	hundred cardinals, wait for the current pope to die or retire and convince two-thirds of
287420	291020	your fellow cardinals to select you as the one, the only pope.
