1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Let's say you want to become Pope, head of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over 1

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,020
billion faithful.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,000
What requirements must you have for this lofty position?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,680
First, be a Catholic and second, be a man.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,640
Which seems a little thin and while it's technically possible for a regular Sunday Catholic to

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,000
become Pope, the last time this happened was essentially never because becoming Pope isn't

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,260
like becoming president.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,300
You can't just run for office.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,760
Selecting the Pope is an inside job and the men who do it are the cardinals and while

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,800
in theory they can select any Catholic man to become Pope, in practice they prefer to

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,040
elevate one of their own.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,480
The last time a non-cardinal became Pope was more than 600 years ago so while it isn't

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,800
an official requirement, it's an unofficial official requirement.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,040
Thus in order to become Pope you'll first need to be a cardinal and to do that you need

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
to start climbing the Catholic corporate ladder.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Step 1.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Become a priest.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
Unlike some churches where you can just fill out a form online and poof, ordained, the

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,880
Catholic Church treats becoming a priest as a real, you-need-training profession.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,360
So you're going to require a lot of education, usually a college degree in Catholic philosophy

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,080
and then a masters in divinity.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,280
In addition to your educational qualifications you must also be a man unmarried and willing

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
to remain celibate.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
If you meet these requirements and have been working with the church then you can be officially

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
ordained as a priest which basically means you get to run a Catholic Church or work with

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
another priest who does.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,320
But you want to move onward and to do that you need to take the job of the man who just

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,560
made you a priest.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Step 2.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Become a bishop.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,920
Bishops are a much more select group.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,580
While there are about 400,000 Catholic priests worldwide there are only about 5,000 bishops.

33
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,820
While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals from which they oversee a number of local

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,820
churches.

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,060
To advance your career you must wait for a bishop in your area to be forced into retirement

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,940
at age 75 or die sooner than that freeing up space for you.

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,060
But you can't just apply because there's already a secret list of potential bishops that's

38
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,420
updated every three years based on who the current bishops in your area think would make

39
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,380
a good replacement for one of their own.

40
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,600
To be on that list, in addition to the obvious requirement of being a pious person, you should

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,940
also be at least 35 years old, have been a priest for at least 5 years and have a doctorate

42
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,500
in theology or equivalent.

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,140
Assuming you're all these things your name may or may not be on the secret list.

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,420
The local bishops then give that list to the Pope's ambassador for your country known as

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,940
the Apostolic Nuncio.

46
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,500
The Nuncio picks three priests from the list, does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,840
and selects the one he thinks is best.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,460
But it's not over because the Nuncio sends his report to Vatican City and the Congress

49
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,660
of Bishops who work there reviewing potential appointments from around the world.

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,500
If the Congress of Bishops doesn't like any of the three candidates they can tell the

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,860
Nuncio to start over, returning to the list, picking another three candidates, doing more

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,900
research, more interviews and sending off their results.

53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,760
When the Congress of Bishops is happy with one of the Nuncio's candidates, that name

54
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,240
is given to the Pope who can reject the candidate and start the whole process over.

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,860
It shouldn't be a surprise that from vacancy to a bishop's replacement can take months

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,520
and on occasion years.

57
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,240
But assuming a bishop in your area retired or died at the right time and you were on

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,600
the secret list of good priests and the Nuncio picked you and you made it through his interview

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,060
and the Congress of Bishops approved you and the Pope didn't veto you, poof, now you're

60
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,060
a bishop.

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,060
But you're still not on top.

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,180
The penultimate promotion is step number three.

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Become a cardinal.

64
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,060
Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits to match, cardinals are not the bosses of

65
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,060
bishops.

66
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,980
They are bishops just with an additional title and additional responsibilities, the most

67
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,220
notable of which is electing the new pope.

68
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,900
The only way to become a cardinal is to get the current pope to appoint you as one.

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,620
And of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever cardinals.

70
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,940
But let's say your ambition doesn't go unnoticed by the pope and he makes you a cardinal.

71
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,900
Now it's time to play the waiting game for his death or retirement.

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,420
And with popes, death is vastly more likely.

73
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,560
And either happens, the cardinals under the age of 80 are brought to Vatican City where

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,900
they are isolated from the outside world, presumably by taking away their cell phones

75
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,860
and tablets and carrier pigeons.

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,260
Once sequestered, the election of a new pope can begin.

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,660
These elections are never exactly the same because the ex-pope leaves instructions on

78
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,640
how he wants his replacements to be picked but in general it works like this.

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,620
Four times a day the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel to vote and to become pope one of them

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,260
must get a two-thirds majority.

81
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540
There's a big dose of mustn't be too hasty here as the cardinals don't just raise their

82
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,260
hands or use a modern preferential voting system but instead write down one name on

83
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,300
a piece of paper, stand before the altar and say a long latin phrase before officially

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,660
casting the ballot.

85
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,820
Once all the cardinals have done this, the votes are counted and then burned.

86
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,380
This is why TV news stations covering the election of pope use super modern HD live

87
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,260
streaming cameras to look at a chimney.

88
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,260
If the smoke is black, no new pope.

89
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,300
The high victory threshold and tediously slow voting process is why it takes so long to

90
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,380
elect a pope.

91
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,740
It's usually at least two weeks of voting, four times a day, six days a week with one

92
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,300
day a week reserved for prayer but the record length is three years.

93
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,900
Assuming you eventually win the support of your fellow cardinals you have one final thing

94
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,460
to do before becoming pope.

95
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,820
Pick yourself a new name.

96
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,980
There's no formal rule and you can name yourself anything you like but it's tradition to take

97
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,580
the name of a previous pope.

98
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,880
Upon the acceptance of your new name the final ballots are burned clean to make the smoke

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,380
turn white and announce to the world that a new pope has been selected.

100
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,580
So that's the career path.

101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,900
Be born into the right half of the population, become one of a billion Catholics, then one

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,700
of four hundred thousand priests, then one of five thousand bishops, then one of two

103
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,420
hundred cardinals, wait for the current pope to die or retire and convince two-thirds of

104
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,020
your fellow cardinals to select you as the one, the only pope.
