00:00.000 --> 00:04.020
Let's say you want to become Pope, head of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over 1

00:04.020 --> 00:05.020
billion faithful.

00:05.020 --> 00:07.000
What requirements must you have for this lofty position?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.680
First, be a Catholic and second, be a man.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.640
Which seems a little thin and while it's technically possible for a regular Sunday Catholic to

00:13.640 --> 00:18.000
become Pope, the last time this happened was essentially never because becoming Pope isn't

00:18.000 --> 00:19.260
like becoming president.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.300
You can't just run for office.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.760
Selecting the Pope is an inside job and the men who do it are the cardinals and while

00:24.760 --> 00:28.800
in theory they can select any Catholic man to become Pope, in practice they prefer to

00:28.800 --> 00:30.040
elevate one of their own.

00:30.040 --> 00:34.480
The last time a non-cardinal became Pope was more than 600 years ago so while it isn't

00:34.480 --> 00:37.800
an official requirement, it's an unofficial official requirement.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.040
Thus in order to become Pope you'll first need to be a cardinal and to do that you need

00:41.040 --> 00:43.600
to start climbing the Catholic corporate ladder.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.600
Step 1.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.600
Become a priest.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.640
Unlike some churches where you can just fill out a form online and poof, ordained, the

00:48.640 --> 00:51.880
Catholic Church treats becoming a priest as a real, you-need-training profession.

00:51.880 --> 00:56.360
So you're going to require a lot of education, usually a college degree in Catholic philosophy

00:56.360 --> 00:58.080
and then a masters in divinity.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.280
In addition to your educational qualifications you must also be a man unmarried and willing

01:02.280 --> 01:03.520
to remain celibate.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.560
If you meet these requirements and have been working with the church then you can be officially

01:06.560 --> 01:10.720
ordained as a priest which basically means you get to run a Catholic Church or work with

01:10.720 --> 01:12.240
another priest who does.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.320
But you want to move onward and to do that you need to take the job of the man who just

01:15.320 --> 01:16.560
made you a priest.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
Step 2.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.560
Become a bishop.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.920
Bishops are a much more select group.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.580
While there are about 400,000 Catholic priests worldwide there are only about 5,000 bishops.

01:24.580 --> 01:28.820
While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals from which they oversee a number of local

01:28.820 --> 01:29.820
churches.

01:29.820 --> 01:33.060
To advance your career you must wait for a bishop in your area to be forced into retirement

01:33.060 --> 01:36.940
at age 75 or die sooner than that freeing up space for you.

01:36.940 --> 01:40.060
But you can't just apply because there's already a secret list of potential bishops that's

01:40.060 --> 01:43.420
updated every three years based on who the current bishops in your area think would make

01:43.420 --> 01:45.380
a good replacement for one of their own.

01:45.380 --> 01:48.600
To be on that list, in addition to the obvious requirement of being a pious person, you should

01:48.600 --> 01:52.940
also be at least 35 years old, have been a priest for at least 5 years and have a doctorate

01:52.940 --> 01:54.500
in theology or equivalent.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.140
Assuming you're all these things your name may or may not be on the secret list.

01:58.140 --> 02:01.420
The local bishops then give that list to the Pope's ambassador for your country known as

02:01.420 --> 02:02.940
the Apostolic Nuncio.

02:02.940 --> 02:06.500
The Nuncio picks three priests from the list, does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews

02:06.500 --> 02:08.840
and selects the one he thinks is best.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.460
But it's not over because the Nuncio sends his report to Vatican City and the Congress

02:12.460 --> 02:15.660
of Bishops who work there reviewing potential appointments from around the world.

02:15.660 --> 02:18.500
If the Congress of Bishops doesn't like any of the three candidates they can tell the

02:18.500 --> 02:21.860
Nuncio to start over, returning to the list, picking another three candidates, doing more

02:21.860 --> 02:23.900
research, more interviews and sending off their results.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.760
When the Congress of Bishops is happy with one of the Nuncio's candidates, that name

02:26.760 --> 02:31.240
is given to the Pope who can reject the candidate and start the whole process over.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.860
It shouldn't be a surprise that from vacancy to a bishop's replacement can take months

02:34.860 --> 02:36.520
and on occasion years.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.240
But assuming a bishop in your area retired or died at the right time and you were on

02:40.240 --> 02:43.600
the secret list of good priests and the Nuncio picked you and you made it through his interview

02:43.600 --> 02:47.060
and the Congress of Bishops approved you and the Pope didn't veto you, poof, now you're

02:47.060 --> 02:48.060
a bishop.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.060
But you're still not on top.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.180
The penultimate promotion is step number three.

02:51.180 --> 02:52.180
Become a cardinal.

02:52.180 --> 02:56.060
Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits to match, cardinals are not the bosses of

02:56.060 --> 02:57.060
bishops.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.980
They are bishops just with an additional title and additional responsibilities, the most

02:59.980 --> 03:02.220
notable of which is electing the new pope.

03:02.220 --> 03:05.900
The only way to become a cardinal is to get the current pope to appoint you as one.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.620
And of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever cardinals.

03:09.620 --> 03:12.940
But let's say your ambition doesn't go unnoticed by the pope and he makes you a cardinal.

03:12.940 --> 03:15.900
Now it's time to play the waiting game for his death or retirement.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.420
And with popes, death is vastly more likely.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.560
And either happens, the cardinals under the age of 80 are brought to Vatican City where

03:21.560 --> 03:24.900
they are isolated from the outside world, presumably by taking away their cell phones

03:24.900 --> 03:26.860
and tablets and carrier pigeons.

03:26.860 --> 03:29.260
Once sequestered, the election of a new pope can begin.

03:29.260 --> 03:32.660
These elections are never exactly the same because the ex-pope leaves instructions on

03:32.660 --> 03:36.640
how he wants his replacements to be picked but in general it works like this.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.620
Four times a day the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel to vote and to become pope one of them

03:40.620 --> 03:42.260
must get a two-thirds majority.

03:42.260 --> 03:46.540
There's a big dose of mustn't be too hasty here as the cardinals don't just raise their

03:46.540 --> 03:50.260
hands or use a modern preferential voting system but instead write down one name on

03:50.260 --> 03:54.300
a piece of paper, stand before the altar and say a long latin phrase before officially

03:54.300 --> 03:55.660
casting the ballot.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.820
Once all the cardinals have done this, the votes are counted and then burned.

03:58.820 --> 04:02.380
This is why TV news stations covering the election of pope use super modern HD live

04:02.380 --> 04:04.260
streaming cameras to look at a chimney.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.260
If the smoke is black, no new pope.

04:06.260 --> 04:10.300
The high victory threshold and tediously slow voting process is why it takes so long to

04:10.300 --> 04:11.380
elect a pope.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.740
It's usually at least two weeks of voting, four times a day, six days a week with one

04:14.740 --> 04:18.300
day a week reserved for prayer but the record length is three years.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.900
Assuming you eventually win the support of your fellow cardinals you have one final thing

04:21.900 --> 04:23.460
to do before becoming pope.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.820
Pick yourself a new name.

04:24.820 --> 04:27.980
There's no formal rule and you can name yourself anything you like but it's tradition to take

04:27.980 --> 04:29.580
the name of a previous pope.

04:29.580 --> 04:32.880
Upon the acceptance of your new name the final ballots are burned clean to make the smoke

04:32.880 --> 04:36.380
turn white and announce to the world that a new pope has been selected.

04:36.380 --> 04:37.580
So that's the career path.

04:37.580 --> 04:40.900
Be born into the right half of the population, become one of a billion Catholics, then one

04:40.900 --> 04:43.700
of four hundred thousand priests, then one of five thousand bishops, then one of two

04:43.700 --> 04:47.420
hundred cardinals, wait for the current pope to die or retire and convince two-thirds of

04:47.420 --> 04:51.020
your fellow cardinals to select you as the one, the only pope.
