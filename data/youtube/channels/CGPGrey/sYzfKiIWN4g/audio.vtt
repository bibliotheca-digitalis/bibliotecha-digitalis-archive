00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Number 5, Vikings.

00:05.680 --> 00:09.160
What would a viking be without its trusty battle helmet and its impressive horns?

00:09.160 --> 00:11.780
The answer is, a more historically accurate viking.

00:11.780 --> 00:14.920
Think for a moment about what wearing headgear like that into battle would mean.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.320
The horns are just easy targets for your opponent to hit and knock off your helmet.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.320
Or if you strap on your helmet, now your opponent has a convenient lever with which to drag

00:21.320 --> 00:24.600
you to the ground and something to hold onto while slitting your throat.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.080
Horned helmets are a terrible idea, which is why archaeologists have never found them

00:28.080 --> 00:30.800
at viking battle sites and there's no evidence that they were ever used.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.500
It was poets and artists, people not known for caring about facts and reality, who gave

00:34.500 --> 00:38.920
the vikings their silly hats during the late 1800s, long after the vikings could correct

00:38.920 --> 00:40.640
their misconceptions.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.080
Number 4, Lady Godiva.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.960
The story of this 11th century English noblewoman is that her mean husband the Earl raised taxes

00:45.960 --> 00:49.520
on the townspeople of Coventry which Lady Godiva, and not surprisingly the locals, thought

00:49.520 --> 00:50.800
were too high.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.220
She badgered her husband and he conceded an exasperation to lower the taxes if she rode

00:54.220 --> 00:57.720
through the town naked, assuming that she never would, but she did.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.720
Because people don't like taxes, even though their house civilization is purchased, Lady

01:00.720 --> 01:05.060
Godiva's story lives on, notably in the Godiva logo and in popular songs.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.760
But while Lady Godiva was a real person and Coventry is a real town, there's no record

01:08.760 --> 01:13.280
of her nude ride from the time when it happened so we can safely assume the story is false.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.440
Just as with the vikings, again, poets and artists are to blame who made it the tale

01:16.440 --> 01:18.600
long after Lady Godiva's death.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.160
Number 3, Napoleon.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.720
Famously this tiny, tiny general, perhaps to compensate for his short stature, took

01:23.720 --> 01:27.360
control of France, greatly expanded its influence and dubbed himself emperor.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.000
Napoleon's official height was indeed 5 foot 2 inches, but at the time French inches were

01:32.000 --> 01:35.360
longer than English inches, so doing the unit conversion, Napoleon's height should have

01:35.360 --> 01:39.520
been reported as 5'7'' in England's imperial units, which is short by today's standards

01:39.520 --> 01:42.880
but was average or slightly above average in the early 1800s.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.080
However England, with its eternal love of all things French, didn't care and went with

01:46.080 --> 01:50.440
the Napoleon-is-so-short-lol version of the story in newspapers and cartoons.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.780
Meanwhile Napoleon was busy introducing the metric system to France and the wider world

01:53.780 --> 01:57.100
to standardize measurements so this sort of confusion would never happen again.

01:57.100 --> 02:01.220
And thankfully the whole world now uses metric... mostly sort of.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.780
Number 2, Roman Vomit.

02:02.780 --> 02:07.020
Ah, the Roman Empire, so great and powerful but corrupted by decadence from within.

02:07.020 --> 02:10.580
And what could be a better symbol of that decadence than the vomitorium, where Romans,

02:10.580 --> 02:14.220
after stuffing themselves with delicious foods, could vomit them all up again to make room

02:14.220 --> 02:16.180
to feast anew?

02:16.180 --> 02:19.180
Vomitoria are real, but this idea of them is not, though the confusion is understandable

02:19.180 --> 02:22.900
because their name, vomitorium, seems to make their purpose so clear.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.980
Even if for some reason you know Latin, perhaps because you live in a country that insists

02:25.980 --> 02:29.300
you waste hundreds of hours of your life learning a dead, useless language, this knowledge

02:29.300 --> 02:33.320
still won't help you because the root word, vomitum, means to spew forth.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.320
So what is it really?

02:34.320 --> 02:38.260
If you've ever been to a big stadium like, say, the ones made by the Romans, you've already

02:38.260 --> 02:39.900
used a vomitorium.

02:39.900 --> 02:44.760
This is what the vomitoria are, the passageways that let lots of people enter or exit at once.

02:44.760 --> 02:49.020
The people are what spews forth in the vomitoria, not the contents of the people.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.660
Number 1, Columbus.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.780
There's so very much wrong with the common retelling of the story of Christopher Columbus

02:53.780 --> 02:56.740
so it's hard to know where to begin, but the biggest misconception is that everyone

02:56.740 --> 03:00.220
else thought the world was flat, but Columbus was the only guy smart enough to know that

03:00.220 --> 03:01.220
it's round.

03:01.220 --> 03:04.880
It makes a daring story, but knowledge of a spherical Earth goes back to at least 5000

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
BC.

03:05.880 --> 03:10.140
That's six and a half thousand years before Columbus set sail.

03:10.140 --> 03:12.660
And that knowledge was never lost to Western civilization.

03:12.660 --> 03:16.740
In 200 BC, Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference and his estimate was still well

03:16.740 --> 03:19.460
known and being used during Columbus' time.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.860
The argument Columbus had with Queen Isabella was not over the shape of the Earth, but of

03:22.860 --> 03:24.140
its size.

03:24.140 --> 03:27.900
Columbus estimated the Earth was much smaller than Queen Isabella and her scientific advisors

03:27.900 --> 03:31.980
did which was why he thought he could make it across the empty Atlantic to India.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.820
But Columbus' size estimate was wrong, again just like Napoleon's height because of mixed

03:35.820 --> 03:36.820
up units.

03:36.820 --> 03:41.420
However, this mistake did send him West to become the first European to discover America.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.020
As long as you ignore the hornless Vikings who beat him by 500 years.
