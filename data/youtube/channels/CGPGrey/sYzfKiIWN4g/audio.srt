1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Number 5, Vikings.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,160
What would a viking be without its trusty battle helmet and its impressive horns?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,780
The answer is, a more historically accurate viking.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,920
Think for a moment about what wearing headgear like that into battle would mean.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,320
The horns are just easy targets for your opponent to hit and knock off your helmet.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Or if you strap on your helmet, now your opponent has a convenient lever with which to drag

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,600
you to the ground and something to hold onto while slitting your throat.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,080
Horned helmets are a terrible idea, which is why archaeologists have never found them

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,800
at viking battle sites and there's no evidence that they were ever used.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,500
It was poets and artists, people not known for caring about facts and reality, who gave

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,920
the vikings their silly hats during the late 1800s, long after the vikings could correct

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,640
their misconceptions.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,080
Number 4, Lady Godiva.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,960
The story of this 11th century English noblewoman is that her mean husband the Earl raised taxes

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,520
on the townspeople of Coventry which Lady Godiva, and not surprisingly the locals, thought

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,800
were too high.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,220
She badgered her husband and he conceded an exasperation to lower the taxes if she rode

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,720
through the town naked, assuming that she never would, but she did.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Because people don't like taxes, even though their house civilization is purchased, Lady

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,060
Godiva's story lives on, notably in the Godiva logo and in popular songs.

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,760
But while Lady Godiva was a real person and Coventry is a real town, there's no record

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,280
of her nude ride from the time when it happened so we can safely assume the story is false.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,440
Just as with the vikings, again, poets and artists are to blame who made it the tale

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,600
long after Lady Godiva's death.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,160
Number 3, Napoleon.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,720
Famously this tiny, tiny general, perhaps to compensate for his short stature, took

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,360
control of France, greatly expanded its influence and dubbed himself emperor.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,000
Napoleon's official height was indeed 5 foot 2 inches, but at the time French inches were

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
longer than English inches, so doing the unit conversion, Napoleon's height should have

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,520
been reported as 5'7'' in England's imperial units, which is short by today's standards

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,880
but was average or slightly above average in the early 1800s.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,080
However England, with its eternal love of all things French, didn't care and went with

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,440
the Napoleon-is-so-short-lol version of the story in newspapers and cartoons.

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,780
Meanwhile Napoleon was busy introducing the metric system to France and the wider world

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,100
to standardize measurements so this sort of confusion would never happen again.

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,220
And thankfully the whole world now uses metric... mostly sort of.

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,780
Number 2, Roman Vomit.

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,020
Ah, the Roman Empire, so great and powerful but corrupted by decadence from within.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,580
And what could be a better symbol of that decadence than the vomitorium, where Romans,

40
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,220
after stuffing themselves with delicious foods, could vomit them all up again to make room

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,180
to feast anew?

42
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,180
Vomitoria are real, but this idea of them is not, though the confusion is understandable

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,900
because their name, vomitorium, seems to make their purpose so clear.

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,980
Even if for some reason you know Latin, perhaps because you live in a country that insists

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,300
you waste hundreds of hours of your life learning a dead, useless language, this knowledge

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,320
still won't help you because the root word, vomitum, means to spew forth.

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
So what is it really?

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,260
If you've ever been to a big stadium like, say, the ones made by the Romans, you've already

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,900
used a vomitorium.

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,760
This is what the vomitoria are, the passageways that let lots of people enter or exit at once.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,020
The people are what spews forth in the vomitoria, not the contents of the people.

52
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,660
Number 1, Columbus.

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,780
There's so very much wrong with the common retelling of the story of Christopher Columbus

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,740
so it's hard to know where to begin, but the biggest misconception is that everyone

55
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,220
else thought the world was flat, but Columbus was the only guy smart enough to know that

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
it's round.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,880
It makes a daring story, but knowledge of a spherical Earth goes back to at least 5000

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
BC.

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,140
That's six and a half thousand years before Columbus set sail.

60
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,660
And that knowledge was never lost to Western civilization.

61
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,740
In 200 BC, Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference and his estimate was still well

62
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,460
known and being used during Columbus' time.

63
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,860
The argument Columbus had with Queen Isabella was not over the shape of the Earth, but of

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,140
its size.

65
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,900
Columbus estimated the Earth was much smaller than Queen Isabella and her scientific advisors

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,980
did which was why he thought he could make it across the empty Atlantic to India.

67
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,820
But Columbus' size estimate was wrong, again just like Napoleon's height because of mixed

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
up units.

69
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,420
However, this mistake did send him West to become the first European to discover America.

70
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,020
As long as you ignore the hornless Vikings who beat him by 500 years.
