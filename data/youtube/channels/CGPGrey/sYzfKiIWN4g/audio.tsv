0	5680	Number 5, Vikings.
5680	9160	What would a viking be without its trusty battle helmet and its impressive horns?
9160	11780	The answer is, a more historically accurate viking.
11780	14920	Think for a moment about what wearing headgear like that into battle would mean.
14920	18320	The horns are just easy targets for your opponent to hit and knock off your helmet.
18320	21320	Or if you strap on your helmet, now your opponent has a convenient lever with which to drag
21320	24600	you to the ground and something to hold onto while slitting your throat.
24600	28080	Horned helmets are a terrible idea, which is why archaeologists have never found them
28080	30800	at viking battle sites and there's no evidence that they were ever used.
30800	34500	It was poets and artists, people not known for caring about facts and reality, who gave
34500	38920	the vikings their silly hats during the late 1800s, long after the vikings could correct
38920	40640	their misconceptions.
40640	42080	Number 4, Lady Godiva.
42080	45960	The story of this 11th century English noblewoman is that her mean husband the Earl raised taxes
45960	49520	on the townspeople of Coventry which Lady Godiva, and not surprisingly the locals, thought
49520	50800	were too high.
50800	54220	She badgered her husband and he conceded an exasperation to lower the taxes if she rode
54220	57720	through the town naked, assuming that she never would, but she did.
57720	60720	Because people don't like taxes, even though their house civilization is purchased, Lady
60720	65060	Godiva's story lives on, notably in the Godiva logo and in popular songs.
65060	68760	But while Lady Godiva was a real person and Coventry is a real town, there's no record
68760	73280	of her nude ride from the time when it happened so we can safely assume the story is false.
73280	76440	Just as with the vikings, again, poets and artists are to blame who made it the tale
76440	78600	long after Lady Godiva's death.
78600	80160	Number 3, Napoleon.
80160	83720	Famously this tiny, tiny general, perhaps to compensate for his short stature, took
83720	87360	control of France, greatly expanded its influence and dubbed himself emperor.
87400	92000	Napoleon's official height was indeed 5 foot 2 inches, but at the time French inches were
92000	95360	longer than English inches, so doing the unit conversion, Napoleon's height should have
95360	99520	been reported as 5'7'' in England's imperial units, which is short by today's standards
99520	102880	but was average or slightly above average in the early 1800s.
102880	106080	However England, with its eternal love of all things French, didn't care and went with
106080	110440	the Napoleon-is-so-short-lol version of the story in newspapers and cartoons.
110440	113780	Meanwhile Napoleon was busy introducing the metric system to France and the wider world
113780	117100	to standardize measurements so this sort of confusion would never happen again.
117100	121220	And thankfully the whole world now uses metric... mostly sort of.
121220	122780	Number 2, Roman Vomit.
122780	127020	Ah, the Roman Empire, so great and powerful but corrupted by decadence from within.
127020	130580	And what could be a better symbol of that decadence than the vomitorium, where Romans,
130580	134220	after stuffing themselves with delicious foods, could vomit them all up again to make room
134220	136180	to feast anew?
136180	139180	Vomitoria are real, but this idea of them is not, though the confusion is understandable
139180	142900	because their name, vomitorium, seems to make their purpose so clear.
142900	145980	Even if for some reason you know Latin, perhaps because you live in a country that insists
145980	149300	you waste hundreds of hours of your life learning a dead, useless language, this knowledge
149300	153320	still won't help you because the root word, vomitum, means to spew forth.
153320	154320	So what is it really?
154320	158260	If you've ever been to a big stadium like, say, the ones made by the Romans, you've already
158260	159900	used a vomitorium.
159900	164760	This is what the vomitoria are, the passageways that let lots of people enter or exit at once.
164760	169020	The people are what spews forth in the vomitoria, not the contents of the people.
169020	170660	Number 1, Columbus.
170660	173780	There's so very much wrong with the common retelling of the story of Christopher Columbus
173780	176740	so it's hard to know where to begin, but the biggest misconception is that everyone
176740	180220	else thought the world was flat, but Columbus was the only guy smart enough to know that
180220	181220	it's round.
181220	184880	It makes a daring story, but knowledge of a spherical Earth goes back to at least 5000
184880	185880	BC.
185880	190140	That's six and a half thousand years before Columbus set sail.
190140	192660	And that knowledge was never lost to Western civilization.
192660	196740	In 200 BC, Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference and his estimate was still well
196740	199460	known and being used during Columbus' time.
199460	202860	The argument Columbus had with Queen Isabella was not over the shape of the Earth, but of
202860	204140	its size.
204140	207900	Columbus estimated the Earth was much smaller than Queen Isabella and her scientific advisors
207900	211980	did which was why he thought he could make it across the empty Atlantic to India.
211980	215820	But Columbus' size estimate was wrong, again just like Napoleon's height because of mixed
215820	216820	up units.
216820	221420	However, this mistake did send him West to become the first European to discover America.
221420	224020	As long as you ignore the hornless Vikings who beat him by 500 years.
