0	4000	Bouncing across a scene, Tumbleweed establish the Wild West as Western.
4000	8600	But more than just props, Tumbleweed are real, and Tumbleweed are alive.
8600	10040	Well, they were alive.
10040	13720	Each Tumbleweed starts as a tiny seed on the craggy landscape,
13720	16200	putting down roots, up branches, opening flowers,
16200	18720	and, through the miracle of life, birthing seeds.
18720	20480	Itty bitty baby tumbles to be.
20480	24640	Now, dropping these seeds straight down won't give the Tumbletots their best head start.
24640	28640	So, what's a parent plant to do but sacrifice their life for their children?
28640	31920	To intentionally starve themselves, to die and to dry,
31920	34720	to catch the wind, to shuffle off this mortal coil,
34720	38320	to bounce across the land, to chance their children to find fertile ground,
38320	42320	to root, to sprout, to grow, to flower, to continue the circle of life.
42320	43640	It's beautiful, really.
43640	47960	These humble tumble rolling across the West in search of empty land to colonize
47960	52640	are as iconically West as Westerners Westerning, because neither are natives.
52640	57200	Before the 1800s, there were no homesteaders and no Tumbleweed in the West.
57200	61440	Tumbleweed are an invasive species and a deeply unwelcome one.
61440	63960	It's time to get real about the trouble with tumbles.
63960	68640	Now, you might be thinking, if the West is mostly empty and Tumbleweed arrived and survived,
68640	69800	what's the big deal?
69800	71240	They're kind of nice.
71240	72520	And you know what? You're right.
72520	73320	Kind of.
73320	74560	Tumbles are like snow.
74560	77400	A little is charming, but a lot is a problem.
77400	79720	And a lot, a lot dangerous.
79720	81960	Tumbleweed stick to things and each other.
81960	84920	One stuck tumble becomes two, ten, a tumulus.
84920	88200	The American interior has vast swaths of land,
88200	93760	and after a tumble terrain takeover, one big windstorm can drown a village under thousands of the things,
93760	98360	with people quickly finding their roads and vehicles and even homes inaccessible.
98360	103440	If you've never seen tumbles on the move or the aftermath of that, it's unreal.
103440	107920	And though a tumble drift looks like a brown snowdrift, this snow is full of thorns.
107920	110080	If you're thinking of a rose, think again.
110080	112520	On tumbles, it's all thorns.
112560	115920	It's brittle to break off in your skin or horse skin where it can fester.
115920	119760	Clearing tumbleweed isn't just painful, but also infuriating.
119760	122520	A tumbleweed drift is both bouncy and sticky.
122520	124840	You're going to have to fork them one at a time.
124840	128000	Tedious at best, Sisyphusian at worst.
128000	130640	You might want to use industrial equipment, but be careful.
130640	132760	Tumbleweed are shockingly flammable.
132760	137080	Dry and airy, but still branch-dense, they are min-maxed kindling.
137080	141520	A tumbleweed will go up in flames way fast and burns way hot.
141520	142360	More on that later.
142360	146400	But even if you manage to clear the town and all the open land around the town,
146400	149960	a single mist seed contains the next tumble torrent.
149960	154480	For while many plants use flowers to attract bees to cross-pollinate and reproduce,
154480	157480	not tumbles, their flowers have nothing for bees.
157480	160840	Instead, exploding pollen directly into the wind.
160840	163040	Hope you don't have allergies to cross-pollinate.
163040	165160	And tumbles don't need two to tango.
165160	168320	A lone tumbleweed can f-pollinate itself.
168320	171200	So that single mist seed will grow up to be a tumble and weed,
171200	173680	containing tens of thousands of seeds.
173680	176200	Hundreds of thousands if it gets large enough.
176200	179440	A single tumble tumbling to town one year leaves a tumble trail the next
179440	181720	and an exponential explosion thereafter.
181720	184160	And then there's the danger to agriculture,
184160	186120	which brings us to the start of this.
186120	189800	A time before tumbleweed in America and a time before homesteading.
189800	192920	It's the 1800s and the start of Westerners' Westerning,
192920	195280	building their first farms and tiny towns.
195280	198160	Growing enough food to feed the adolescent nation was vital.
198160	200240	Nearly everyone's job had to be farming,
200240	203840	and the newly-created Department of Agriculture had the job of writing pro tips
203840	205080	on how best to do that,
205080	208200	along with collecting seeds and samples from the new continent.
208200	212480	Which is how all was normal until one day a letter arrived for DOA.
212480	215880	Hey, there's this a tumble and weed giving us some trouble.
215880	217200	Can you come take a gander?
217200	218200	And so she did.
218200	220920	Arriving to find South Dakota in bad shape.
220920	224840	A weedy infection rapidly developing, damaging the food supply.
224840	227400	These new weeds stole ground nutrients for themselves
227400	229280	before crops could even be planted.
229280	232280	Or they would grow in between crops, choking them out.
232280	234280	During harvest, they hurt the draft animals
234280	237120	and clogged or broke the newly mechanized farm equipment.
237120	241400	Early estimates were crop losses of 20% because of the tumbles.
241400	244560	DOA tried to constrain the situation using education.
244560	246000	Wanted. Tumbleweed.
246000	247080	Kill on sight.
247080	249400	AKA prickly thistle, AKA calitragis,
249400	252240	AKA the windwitch, AKA the Russian thistle.
252240	254800	This, by the way, is the motherland where the species is native,
254800	257080	and from where crop seed contaminated with tumble seed
257080	259640	probably came to arrive in South Dakota
259640	262600	on perhaps a single farm to start the infection.
262600	264600	Which grew worse by the year,
264600	267840	and the Department of Agriculture's efforts to stop it were futile.
267840	271080	Way too much land, far too few people.
271080	274520	Worse, this new land was tumbletopia, and still is.
274520	276120	See this round of rectangle states?
276120	279600	It's the Great Plains, abutting the Great American Desert.
279600	284000	An enormous stretch of land, flat, open, windy.
284000	286640	South Dakota's neighbors had no chance,
286640	288160	nor neighbors' neighbors.
288160	290120	From patient zero, boom.
290120	293600	By the turn of the century, the tumbleweed infection covered the interior,
293600	296880	eventually spreading north to Canada and south down to Mexico.
296880	298880	America's mountains were a barrier for a while,
298880	302800	until tumbleweed hitched a ride on the trains that had freshly connected the continent,
302800	305280	jaunting over the mountains west and east
305280	309080	to establish themselves in every spared pocket of empty land.
309080	310160	Oh dear.
310160	311160	But it gets better.
311160	312520	Back to fires.
312520	314320	Specifically, prairie fires.
314320	318680	A nice, big field of dry wheat is just begging to burst into flames.
318680	322000	The only early tech to stop fires was to build firebreaks,
322000	326760	physically stopping the flames with neat, straight, vitally empty stretches of land
326760	328320	the fire could not cross.
328320	330880	But more perfect tunnels for tumbles you could not make.
330880	334880	Even if the firebreaks were kept clear, fire makes its own wind,
334880	338720	sucking in cold air from ground level to blow out hot up and over.
338720	343320	Thus, transforming tumbles into fireballs to breach the break.
343320	346960	So started the first volley in the war on tumbleweed.
346960	349960	But for the Department of Agriculture to eradicate the infection
349960	353080	from the interior farmland and towns where they did the most damage
353080	357280	would mean not only catching every weed and seed across a third of a continent,
357280	359680	with the cooperation of two annoyed international neighbors,
359680	365200	but also finding every patch of infection across the mountains in the other two-thirds.
365200	367320	An impossible task.
367320	370320	So, uh, that's why tumbleweed are still here,
370320	372840	and have been around for so long and in such numbers,
372840	375160	people forget there was ever a before time.
375160	377920	But not the United States Department of Agriculture,
377920	381160	from the 1800s to 1900s to 200s,
381160	383880	still trying to rid America of the weed.
383880	386280	But so far, without success.
386280	388480	And that is the trouble with tumbles.
