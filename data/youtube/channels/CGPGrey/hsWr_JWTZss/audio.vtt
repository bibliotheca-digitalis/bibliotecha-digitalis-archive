00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Bouncing across a scene, Tumbleweed establish the Wild West as Western.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.600
But more than just props, Tumbleweed are real, and Tumbleweed are alive.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.040
Well, they were alive.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.720
Each Tumbleweed starts as a tiny seed on the craggy landscape,

00:13.720 --> 00:16.200
putting down roots, up branches, opening flowers,

00:16.200 --> 00:18.720
and, through the miracle of life, birthing seeds.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.480
Itty bitty baby tumbles to be.

00:20.480 --> 00:24.640
Now, dropping these seeds straight down won't give the Tumbletots their best head start.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.640
So, what's a parent plant to do but sacrifice their life for their children?

00:28.640 --> 00:31.920
To intentionally starve themselves, to die and to dry,

00:31.920 --> 00:34.720
to catch the wind, to shuffle off this mortal coil,

00:34.720 --> 00:38.320
to bounce across the land, to chance their children to find fertile ground,

00:38.320 --> 00:42.320
to root, to sprout, to grow, to flower, to continue the circle of life.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.640
It's beautiful, really.

00:43.640 --> 00:47.960
These humble tumble rolling across the West in search of empty land to colonize

00:47.960 --> 00:52.640
are as iconically West as Westerners Westerning, because neither are natives.

00:52.640 --> 00:57.200
Before the 1800s, there were no homesteaders and no Tumbleweed in the West.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.440
Tumbleweed are an invasive species and a deeply unwelcome one.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.960
It's time to get real about the trouble with tumbles.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.640
Now, you might be thinking, if the West is mostly empty and Tumbleweed arrived and survived,

01:08.640 --> 01:09.800
what's the big deal?

01:09.800 --> 01:11.240
They're kind of nice.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.520
And you know what? You're right.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.320
Kind of.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.560
Tumbles are like snow.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.400
A little is charming, but a lot is a problem.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.720
And a lot, a lot dangerous.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.960
Tumbleweed stick to things and each other.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.920
One stuck tumble becomes two, ten, a tumulus.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.200
The American interior has vast swaths of land,

01:28.200 --> 01:33.760
and after a tumble terrain takeover, one big windstorm can drown a village under thousands of the things,

01:33.760 --> 01:38.360
with people quickly finding their roads and vehicles and even homes inaccessible.

01:38.360 --> 01:43.440
If you've never seen tumbles on the move or the aftermath of that, it's unreal.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.920
And though a tumble drift looks like a brown snowdrift, this snow is full of thorns.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.080
If you're thinking of a rose, think again.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.520
On tumbles, it's all thorns.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.920
It's brittle to break off in your skin or horse skin where it can fester.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.760
Clearing tumbleweed isn't just painful, but also infuriating.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.520
A tumbleweed drift is both bouncy and sticky.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.840
You're going to have to fork them one at a time.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.000
Tedious at best, Sisyphusian at worst.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.640
You might want to use industrial equipment, but be careful.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.760
Tumbleweed are shockingly flammable.

02:12.760 --> 02:17.080
Dry and airy, but still branch-dense, they are min-maxed kindling.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.520
A tumbleweed will go up in flames way fast and burns way hot.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.360
More on that later.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.400
But even if you manage to clear the town and all the open land around the town,

02:26.400 --> 02:29.960
a single mist seed contains the next tumble torrent.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.480
For while many plants use flowers to attract bees to cross-pollinate and reproduce,

02:34.480 --> 02:37.480
not tumbles, their flowers have nothing for bees.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.840
Instead, exploding pollen directly into the wind.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.040
Hope you don't have allergies to cross-pollinate.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.160
And tumbles don't need two to tango.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.320
A lone tumbleweed can f-pollinate itself.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.200
So that single mist seed will grow up to be a tumble and weed,

02:51.200 --> 02:53.680
containing tens of thousands of seeds.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.200
Hundreds of thousands if it gets large enough.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.440
A single tumble tumbling to town one year leaves a tumble trail the next

02:59.440 --> 03:01.720
and an exponential explosion thereafter.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.160
And then there's the danger to agriculture,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.120
which brings us to the start of this.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.800
A time before tumbleweed in America and a time before homesteading.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.920
It's the 1800s and the start of Westerners' Westerning,

03:12.920 --> 03:15.280
building their first farms and tiny towns.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.160
Growing enough food to feed the adolescent nation was vital.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.240
Nearly everyone's job had to be farming,

03:20.240 --> 03:23.840
and the newly-created Department of Agriculture had the job of writing pro tips

03:23.840 --> 03:25.080
on how best to do that,

03:25.080 --> 03:28.200
along with collecting seeds and samples from the new continent.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.480
Which is how all was normal until one day a letter arrived for DOA.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.880
Hey, there's this a tumble and weed giving us some trouble.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.200
Can you come take a gander?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.200
And so she did.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.920
Arriving to find South Dakota in bad shape.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.840
A weedy infection rapidly developing, damaging the food supply.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.400
These new weeds stole ground nutrients for themselves

03:47.400 --> 03:49.280
before crops could even be planted.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.280
Or they would grow in between crops, choking them out.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.280
During harvest, they hurt the draft animals

03:54.280 --> 03:57.120
and clogged or broke the newly mechanized farm equipment.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.400
Early estimates were crop losses of 20% because of the tumbles.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.560
DOA tried to constrain the situation using education.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.000
Wanted. Tumbleweed.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.080
Kill on sight.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.400
AKA prickly thistle, AKA calitragis,

04:09.400 --> 04:12.240
AKA the windwitch, AKA the Russian thistle.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.800
This, by the way, is the motherland where the species is native,

04:14.800 --> 04:17.080
and from where crop seed contaminated with tumble seed

04:17.080 --> 04:19.640
probably came to arrive in South Dakota

04:19.640 --> 04:22.600
on perhaps a single farm to start the infection.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
Which grew worse by the year,

04:24.600 --> 04:27.840
and the Department of Agriculture's efforts to stop it were futile.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.080
Way too much land, far too few people.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.520
Worse, this new land was tumbletopia, and still is.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.120
See this round of rectangle states?

04:36.120 --> 04:39.600
It's the Great Plains, abutting the Great American Desert.

04:39.600 --> 04:44.000
An enormous stretch of land, flat, open, windy.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.640
South Dakota's neighbors had no chance,

04:46.640 --> 04:48.160
nor neighbors' neighbors.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.120
From patient zero, boom.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.600
By the turn of the century, the tumbleweed infection covered the interior,

04:53.600 --> 04:56.880
eventually spreading north to Canada and south down to Mexico.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.880
America's mountains were a barrier for a while,

04:58.880 --> 05:02.800
until tumbleweed hitched a ride on the trains that had freshly connected the continent,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.280
jaunting over the mountains west and east

05:05.280 --> 05:09.080
to establish themselves in every spared pocket of empty land.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.160
Oh dear.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.160
But it gets better.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.520
Back to fires.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.320
Specifically, prairie fires.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.680
A nice, big field of dry wheat is just begging to burst into flames.

05:18.680 --> 05:22.000
The only early tech to stop fires was to build firebreaks,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.760
physically stopping the flames with neat, straight, vitally empty stretches of land

05:26.760 --> 05:28.320
the fire could not cross.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.880
But more perfect tunnels for tumbles you could not make.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.880
Even if the firebreaks were kept clear, fire makes its own wind,

05:34.880 --> 05:38.720
sucking in cold air from ground level to blow out hot up and over.

05:38.720 --> 05:43.320
Thus, transforming tumbles into fireballs to breach the break.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.960
So started the first volley in the war on tumbleweed.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.960
But for the Department of Agriculture to eradicate the infection

05:49.960 --> 05:53.080
from the interior farmland and towns where they did the most damage

05:53.080 --> 05:57.280
would mean not only catching every weed and seed across a third of a continent,

05:57.280 --> 05:59.680
with the cooperation of two annoyed international neighbors,

05:59.680 --> 06:05.200
but also finding every patch of infection across the mountains in the other two-thirds.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.320
An impossible task.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.320
So, uh, that's why tumbleweed are still here,

06:10.320 --> 06:12.840
and have been around for so long and in such numbers,

06:12.840 --> 06:15.160
people forget there was ever a before time.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.920
But not the United States Department of Agriculture,

06:17.920 --> 06:21.160
from the 1800s to 1900s to 200s,

06:21.160 --> 06:23.880
still trying to rid America of the weed.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.280
But so far, without success.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.480
And that is the trouble with tumbles.
