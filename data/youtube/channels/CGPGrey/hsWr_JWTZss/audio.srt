1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Bouncing across a scene, Tumbleweed establish the Wild West as Western.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,600
But more than just props, Tumbleweed are real, and Tumbleweed are alive.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,040
Well, they were alive.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,720
Each Tumbleweed starts as a tiny seed on the craggy landscape,

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,200
putting down roots, up branches, opening flowers,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,720
and, through the miracle of life, birthing seeds.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
Itty bitty baby tumbles to be.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
Now, dropping these seeds straight down won't give the Tumbletots their best head start.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
So, what's a parent plant to do but sacrifice their life for their children?

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
To intentionally starve themselves, to die and to dry,

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,720
to catch the wind, to shuffle off this mortal coil,

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,320
to bounce across the land, to chance their children to find fertile ground,

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
to root, to sprout, to grow, to flower, to continue the circle of life.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
It's beautiful, really.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,960
These humble tumble rolling across the West in search of empty land to colonize

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,640
are as iconically West as Westerners Westerning, because neither are natives.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,200
Before the 1800s, there were no homesteaders and no Tumbleweed in the West.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
Tumbleweed are an invasive species and a deeply unwelcome one.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,960
It's time to get real about the trouble with tumbles.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,640
Now, you might be thinking, if the West is mostly empty and Tumbleweed arrived and survived,

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,800
what's the big deal?

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
They're kind of nice.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,520
And you know what? You're right.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,320
Kind of.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,560
Tumbles are like snow.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,400
A little is charming, but a lot is a problem.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,720
And a lot, a lot dangerous.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,960
Tumbleweed stick to things and each other.

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,920
One stuck tumble becomes two, ten, a tumulus.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,200
The American interior has vast swaths of land,

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,760
and after a tumble terrain takeover, one big windstorm can drown a village under thousands of the things,

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,360
with people quickly finding their roads and vehicles and even homes inaccessible.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,440
If you've never seen tumbles on the move or the aftermath of that, it's unreal.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,920
And though a tumble drift looks like a brown snowdrift, this snow is full of thorns.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,080
If you're thinking of a rose, think again.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,520
On tumbles, it's all thorns.

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
It's brittle to break off in your skin or horse skin where it can fester.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Clearing tumbleweed isn't just painful, but also infuriating.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,520
A tumbleweed drift is both bouncy and sticky.

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,840
You're going to have to fork them one at a time.

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,000
Tedious at best, Sisyphusian at worst.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,640
You might want to use industrial equipment, but be careful.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,760
Tumbleweed are shockingly flammable.

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,080
Dry and airy, but still branch-dense, they are min-maxed kindling.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,520
A tumbleweed will go up in flames way fast and burns way hot.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
More on that later.

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,400
But even if you manage to clear the town and all the open land around the town,

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,960
a single mist seed contains the next tumble torrent.

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,480
For while many plants use flowers to attract bees to cross-pollinate and reproduce,

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
not tumbles, their flowers have nothing for bees.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,840
Instead, exploding pollen directly into the wind.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,040
Hope you don't have allergies to cross-pollinate.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,160
And tumbles don't need two to tango.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,320
A lone tumbleweed can f-pollinate itself.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,200
So that single mist seed will grow up to be a tumble and weed,

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
containing tens of thousands of seeds.

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,200
Hundreds of thousands if it gets large enough.

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,440
A single tumble tumbling to town one year leaves a tumble trail the next

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,720
and an exponential explosion thereafter.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,160
And then there's the danger to agriculture,

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120
which brings us to the start of this.

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,800
A time before tumbleweed in America and a time before homesteading.

63
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,920
It's the 1800s and the start of Westerners' Westerning,

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,280
building their first farms and tiny towns.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,160
Growing enough food to feed the adolescent nation was vital.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,240
Nearly everyone's job had to be farming,

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,840
and the newly-created Department of Agriculture had the job of writing pro tips

68
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,080
on how best to do that,

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,200
along with collecting seeds and samples from the new continent.

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Which is how all was normal until one day a letter arrived for DOA.

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Hey, there's this a tumble and weed giving us some trouble.

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
Can you come take a gander?

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
And so she did.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,920
Arriving to find South Dakota in bad shape.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,840
A weedy infection rapidly developing, damaging the food supply.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,400
These new weeds stole ground nutrients for themselves

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,280
before crops could even be planted.

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Or they would grow in between crops, choking them out.

79
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
During harvest, they hurt the draft animals

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,120
and clogged or broke the newly mechanized farm equipment.

81
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,400
Early estimates were crop losses of 20% because of the tumbles.

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,560
DOA tried to constrain the situation using education.

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
Wanted. Tumbleweed.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Kill on sight.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,400
AKA prickly thistle, AKA calitragis,

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,240
AKA the windwitch, AKA the Russian thistle.

87
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,800
This, by the way, is the motherland where the species is native,

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,080
and from where crop seed contaminated with tumble seed

89
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,640
probably came to arrive in South Dakota

90
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,600
on perhaps a single farm to start the infection.

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Which grew worse by the year,

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,840
and the Department of Agriculture's efforts to stop it were futile.

93
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,080
Way too much land, far too few people.

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,520
Worse, this new land was tumbletopia, and still is.

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,120
See this round of rectangle states?

96
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,600
It's the Great Plains, abutting the Great American Desert.

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
An enormous stretch of land, flat, open, windy.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,640
South Dakota's neighbors had no chance,

99
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
nor neighbors' neighbors.

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
From patient zero, boom.

101
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,600
By the turn of the century, the tumbleweed infection covered the interior,

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
eventually spreading north to Canada and south down to Mexico.

103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
America's mountains were a barrier for a while,

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,800
until tumbleweed hitched a ride on the trains that had freshly connected the continent,

105
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
jaunting over the mountains west and east

106
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,080
to establish themselves in every spared pocket of empty land.

107
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,160
Oh dear.

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
But it gets better.

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,520
Back to fires.

110
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Specifically, prairie fires.

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,680
A nice, big field of dry wheat is just begging to burst into flames.

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,000
The only early tech to stop fires was to build firebreaks,

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,760
physically stopping the flames with neat, straight, vitally empty stretches of land

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
the fire could not cross.

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
But more perfect tunnels for tumbles you could not make.

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Even if the firebreaks were kept clear, fire makes its own wind,

117
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
sucking in cold air from ground level to blow out hot up and over.

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,320
Thus, transforming tumbles into fireballs to breach the break.

119
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,960
So started the first volley in the war on tumbleweed.

120
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
But for the Department of Agriculture to eradicate the infection

121
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,080
from the interior farmland and towns where they did the most damage

122
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,280
would mean not only catching every weed and seed across a third of a continent,

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
with the cooperation of two annoyed international neighbors,

124
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,200
but also finding every patch of infection across the mountains in the other two-thirds.

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,320
An impossible task.

126
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,320
So, uh, that's why tumbleweed are still here,

127
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,840
and have been around for so long and in such numbers,

128
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,160
people forget there was ever a before time.

129
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
But not the United States Department of Agriculture,

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,160
from the 1800s to 1900s to 200s,

131
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
still trying to rid America of the weed.

132
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,280
But so far, without success.

133
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,480
And that is the trouble with tumbles.
