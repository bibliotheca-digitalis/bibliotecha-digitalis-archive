1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Thinking of your phone as an extension of yourself isn't crazy.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
To say that your phone knows more about you than you know about you isn't an exaggeration,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,080
it's a statement of fact.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,840
Do you remember your location every minute of every day?

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,480
Do you remember what you said to your friend last leap day at 10.47 word for word?

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,200
Yeah, of course not.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,880
Hell, without photos entire holidays would slide out of your mind.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,400
While paperwork that tracks us has existed since papyrus without people feeling like

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,520
those hieroglyphs were literally an extension of the human mind,

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,120
a phone can hold the equivalent of millions of papyrus pages.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,040
At some point, a difference of amount becomes a difference of kind.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,840
Since you bought it, how many hours has your phone been more than an arm's reach away?

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,280
Possibly zero.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
There's no other object like that in your life.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,200
Given the choice to have someone read your mind or read your phone,

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
if you seriously think about it, you'd probably pick the former.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
Compared to what's in your phone, your brain holds a tiny amount of information.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,040
Much of it wrong, all of it lossy.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,840
It's easy to forget what kind of embarrassment your phone contains because it has so much

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,520
you can't even remember.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,600
As you discover when someone flips through a bunch of photos you thought were safe but

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
suddenly discover aren't.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,760
And while the phone now is an extension of the self, we all know where this is going.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,600
A computer chip in your skull will eventually be as quasi-mandatory as a phone is today

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,720
and avoiding one will make you seem Amish.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
If we don't protect our most intimate digital devices as part of the self,

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,480
we're going to be in some scary places in the future.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,040
Because the law is a complicated brick structure of individual laws,

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,440
each resting on what came before.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,520
This is why you hear lawyers argue based on laws from 300 years ago.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,400
That's not by insanity but by design.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,600
And it's why people freak out over court cases that lay down a new brick in a new area.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,120
It's not about this brick.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,200
It's about what will inevitably be built on top of it.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,960
To argue, don't worry, this law is just for this case this time is to argue against

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
what the law is.

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
Like a chess player saying to his opponent,

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
this move isn't about future moves.

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,840
That's not how this works.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
That's not how any of this works.

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
300 years ago someone writes a law about papers in your house at a time when papers and books

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
were luxury items and half the population illiterate and then it's applied to millions

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,720
of intangible files on your phone which in aggregate record every detail of your life.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,920
Maybe you think that's good, maybe you don't, but either way the modern law is built atop

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
the old.

46
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
And it's why people are right to be concerned about each precedent-setting law and why

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
slippery slope fallacy does not apply here.

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Thinking about today's law is thinking about future law and access to your phone today

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,960
is unavoidably about access to your mind tomorrow.
