0	3600	Thinking of your phone as an extension of yourself isn't crazy.
3600	8400	To say that your phone knows more about you than you know about you isn't an exaggeration,
8400	10080	it's a statement of fact.
10080	13840	Do you remember your location every minute of every day?
13840	18480	Do you remember what you said to your friend last leap day at 10.47 word for word?
18480	19200	Yeah, of course not.
19200	22880	Hell, without photos entire holidays would slide out of your mind.
22880	26400	While paperwork that tracks us has existed since papyrus without people feeling like
26400	29520	those hieroglyphs were literally an extension of the human mind,
29520	33120	a phone can hold the equivalent of millions of papyrus pages.
33120	37040	At some point, a difference of amount becomes a difference of kind.
37040	41840	Since you bought it, how many hours has your phone been more than an arm's reach away?
41840	43280	Possibly zero.
43280	45920	There's no other object like that in your life.
45920	49200	Given the choice to have someone read your mind or read your phone,
49200	52480	if you seriously think about it, you'd probably pick the former.
52480	56800	Compared to what's in your phone, your brain holds a tiny amount of information.
56800	59040	Much of it wrong, all of it lossy.
59120	63840	It's easy to forget what kind of embarrassment your phone contains because it has so much
63840	65520	you can't even remember.
65520	69600	As you discover when someone flips through a bunch of photos you thought were safe but
69600	71360	suddenly discover aren't.
71360	75760	And while the phone now is an extension of the self, we all know where this is going.
75760	81600	A computer chip in your skull will eventually be as quasi-mandatory as a phone is today
81600	84720	and avoiding one will make you seem Amish.
84720	88640	If we don't protect our most intimate digital devices as part of the self,
89200	92480	we're going to be in some scary places in the future.
92480	97040	Because the law is a complicated brick structure of individual laws,
97040	99440	each resting on what came before.
99440	103520	This is why you hear lawyers argue based on laws from 300 years ago.
103520	106400	That's not by insanity but by design.
106400	111600	And it's why people freak out over court cases that lay down a new brick in a new area.
111600	113120	It's not about this brick.
113120	117200	It's about what will inevitably be built on top of it.
117200	122960	To argue, don't worry, this law is just for this case this time is to argue against
122960	124560	what the law is.
124560	126640	Like a chess player saying to his opponent,
126640	128640	this move isn't about future moves.
128640	129840	That's not how this works.
129840	131360	That's not how any of this works.
131360	135680	300 years ago someone writes a law about papers in your house at a time when papers and books
135680	139760	were luxury items and half the population illiterate and then it's applied to millions
139760	144720	of intangible files on your phone which in aggregate record every detail of your life.
144720	149920	Maybe you think that's good, maybe you don't, but either way the modern law is built atop
149920	150720	the old.
150720	155280	And it's why people are right to be concerned about each precedent-setting law and why
155280	158640	slippery slope fallacy does not apply here.
158640	164640	Thinking about today's law is thinking about future law and access to your phone today
164640	170960	is unavoidably about access to your mind tomorrow.
