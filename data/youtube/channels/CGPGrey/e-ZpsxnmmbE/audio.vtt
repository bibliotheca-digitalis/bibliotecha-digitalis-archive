00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Thinking of your phone as an extension of yourself isn't crazy.

00:03.600 --> 00:08.400
To say that your phone knows more about you than you know about you isn't an exaggeration,

00:08.400 --> 00:10.080
it's a statement of fact.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.840
Do you remember your location every minute of every day?

00:13.840 --> 00:18.480
Do you remember what you said to your friend last leap day at 10.47 word for word?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.200
Yeah, of course not.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.880
Hell, without photos entire holidays would slide out of your mind.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.400
While paperwork that tracks us has existed since papyrus without people feeling like

00:26.400 --> 00:29.520
those hieroglyphs were literally an extension of the human mind,

00:29.520 --> 00:33.120
a phone can hold the equivalent of millions of papyrus pages.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.040
At some point, a difference of amount becomes a difference of kind.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.840
Since you bought it, how many hours has your phone been more than an arm's reach away?

00:41.840 --> 00:43.280
Possibly zero.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.920
There's no other object like that in your life.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.200
Given the choice to have someone read your mind or read your phone,

00:49.200 --> 00:52.480
if you seriously think about it, you'd probably pick the former.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.800
Compared to what's in your phone, your brain holds a tiny amount of information.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.040
Much of it wrong, all of it lossy.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.840
It's easy to forget what kind of embarrassment your phone contains because it has so much

01:03.840 --> 01:05.520
you can't even remember.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.600
As you discover when someone flips through a bunch of photos you thought were safe but

01:09.600 --> 01:11.360
suddenly discover aren't.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.760
And while the phone now is an extension of the self, we all know where this is going.

01:15.760 --> 01:21.600
A computer chip in your skull will eventually be as quasi-mandatory as a phone is today

01:21.600 --> 01:24.720
and avoiding one will make you seem Amish.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.640
If we don't protect our most intimate digital devices as part of the self,

01:29.200 --> 01:32.480
we're going to be in some scary places in the future.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.040
Because the law is a complicated brick structure of individual laws,

01:37.040 --> 01:39.440
each resting on what came before.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.520
This is why you hear lawyers argue based on laws from 300 years ago.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.400
That's not by insanity but by design.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.600
And it's why people freak out over court cases that lay down a new brick in a new area.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.120
It's not about this brick.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.200
It's about what will inevitably be built on top of it.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.960
To argue, don't worry, this law is just for this case this time is to argue against

02:02.960 --> 02:04.560
what the law is.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.640
Like a chess player saying to his opponent,

02:06.640 --> 02:08.640
this move isn't about future moves.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.840
That's not how this works.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.360
That's not how any of this works.

02:11.360 --> 02:15.680
300 years ago someone writes a law about papers in your house at a time when papers and books

02:15.680 --> 02:19.760
were luxury items and half the population illiterate and then it's applied to millions

02:19.760 --> 02:24.720
of intangible files on your phone which in aggregate record every detail of your life.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.920
Maybe you think that's good, maybe you don't, but either way the modern law is built atop

02:29.920 --> 02:30.720
the old.

02:30.720 --> 02:35.280
And it's why people are right to be concerned about each precedent-setting law and why

02:35.280 --> 02:38.640
slippery slope fallacy does not apply here.

02:38.640 --> 02:44.640
Thinking about today's law is thinking about future law and access to your phone today

02:44.640 --> 02:50.960
is unavoidably about access to your mind tomorrow.
