1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
This is you, this is your family tree, and this is your family tree explained.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,840
You have parents, and your parents have parents.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,880
These are your grandparents, who also have parents.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,320
Your great-grandparents.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,560
Keep adding parents, keep adding greats.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,360
For every G in the name, there is one generation in between you and that person.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,400
Grandparents, one G, one generational in-betweener.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Great-great-great-grandparents, four Gs, four in-betweeners.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,840
Continuing with the basics, you have siblings, and so do your parents.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,760
These are your aunts and uncles.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
Up the tree, you may call these people your great-aunts and uncles,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,120
but your grandparents' siblings are really your grand-aunts and uncles.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
Greats are reserved for the levels above grand.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Your great-grandparents' siblings are your great-grand-aunts and uncles.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,480
Now, down the tree, your siblings' children are your nieces and nephews,

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,520
collectively, niblings, and you are their aunt or uncle.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Their children are your grand-nieces and nephews, and you are their grand-aunt or uncle.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
We've gone up and we've gone down, and now it's time to go sideways.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,480
When you get married, you get everyone's favorite, in-laws.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,080
You're on the same level of the family tree as your spouse's siblings.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
You're a kind of pseudo-sibling.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
All the new family's relationships to you are the same as to your spouse,

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,880
but they get the in-law prefix.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
It's pretty straightforward, except for one case.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
Your spouse's siblings are your siblings-in-law,

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
but are your siblings-in-law's spouses also your siblings-in-law?

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,680
It's a little unclear.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,880
All right, enough with the in-laws.

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,600
It's on to the reason you're probably watching this video.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,240
Cousins.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,160
Your aunt and uncle's children are your cousins, but there are many kinds of cousins,

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,640
and to better understand them, we need to simplify this family tree and think downward.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,600
Here's you, your children, and your grandchildren.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,880
Your grandchildren are first cousins to each other,

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,000
and their children, your great-grandchildren, are second cousins to each other, and so on.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
The cousin number is the same as the G-rule.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,800
It tells you how many in-betweeners until the connection on the family tree.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,440
Fourth cousins, four in-betweeners, and a shared great-great-great-grandparent.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,840
According to the rule, you're first cousins, and you connect at your grandparent.

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
And second cousins share a great-grandparent connection.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
Just match the cousin number with the number of Gs, and you're all set.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,800
Simple.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,840
Side note here, continuing this rule in reverse means that siblings can technically call each

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,960
other zeroth cousins, which they totally should.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,080
And you are your own negative first cousin?

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,640
Weird.

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,880
All done here now, nothing more to talk about.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Oh right, the once-removed thing.

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
You may have noticed these cousins are all on the same level.

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
Removed just describes how many generations apart people are.

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
For example, what's the family connection between these two?

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,280
Start by taking the smaller cousin number, first cousins, and count the levels apart,

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
once removed.

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,280
These are first cousins twice removed, thrice removed.

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
And these are second cousins once removed.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Doing all this on our simplified drawing of your descendants is a bit too easy, as most

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
family trees look more like this.

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,320
The rules are still the same, first cousins, second cousins, and the removed, but it is

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,200
a bit harder to tell quickly who exactly is your second cousin twice removed, or your

60
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
great-grand-aunt-in-law.

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,640
To help, there is a chart you can download which will both make it much easier to figure

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,640
out what grand-nibbling or cousin-removed you are to anyone at the next family reunion,

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,520
and obviously show how cool you are.

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
Now, we're really done.

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,640
Unless you start thinking about the math of all of these family members.

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,720
Just how many great-great-great-great-grandparents do you have?

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,600
64?

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,000
And those great-ex-grandparents had kids, giving you a whole lot of cousins.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,960
This chart happens to stop at tenth cousins, of which you may have more than two thousand?

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,400
Which seems like way too many, but these numbers both have big, possibly unsettling asterisks

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,040
attached to them, which we will talk about more in Part 2, Family Genetics Explained.
