00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
This is you, this is your family tree, and this is your family tree explained.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.840
You have parents, and your parents have parents.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.880
These are your grandparents, who also have parents.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.320
Your great-grandparents.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.560
Keep adding parents, keep adding greats.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.360
For every G in the name, there is one generation in between you and that person.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.400
Grandparents, one G, one generational in-betweener.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.480
Great-great-great-grandparents, four Gs, four in-betweeners.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.840
Continuing with the basics, you have siblings, and so do your parents.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.760
These are your aunts and uncles.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.040
Up the tree, you may call these people your great-aunts and uncles,

00:35.040 --> 00:39.120
but your grandparents' siblings are really your grand-aunts and uncles.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.920
Greats are reserved for the levels above grand.

00:41.920 --> 00:46.560
Your great-grandparents' siblings are your great-grand-aunts and uncles.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.480
Now, down the tree, your siblings' children are your nieces and nephews,

00:50.480 --> 00:53.520
collectively, niblings, and you are their aunt or uncle.

00:53.520 --> 00:58.320
Their children are your grand-nieces and nephews, and you are their grand-aunt or uncle.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.520
We've gone up and we've gone down, and now it's time to go sideways.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.480
When you get married, you get everyone's favorite, in-laws.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.080
You're on the same level of the family tree as your spouse's siblings.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.680
You're a kind of pseudo-sibling.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.040
All the new family's relationships to you are the same as to your spouse,

01:13.040 --> 01:14.880
but they get the in-law prefix.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.520
It's pretty straightforward, except for one case.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.640
Your spouse's siblings are your siblings-in-law,

01:20.640 --> 01:24.480
but are your siblings-in-law's spouses also your siblings-in-law?

01:24.480 --> 01:25.680
It's a little unclear.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.880
All right, enough with the in-laws.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.600
It's on to the reason you're probably watching this video.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.240
Cousins.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.160
Your aunt and uncle's children are your cousins, but there are many kinds of cousins,

01:34.160 --> 01:38.640
and to better understand them, we need to simplify this family tree and think downward.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.600
Here's you, your children, and your grandchildren.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.880
Your grandchildren are first cousins to each other,

01:44.880 --> 01:50.000
and their children, your great-grandchildren, are second cousins to each other, and so on.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.720
The cousin number is the same as the G-rule.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.800
It tells you how many in-betweeners until the connection on the family tree.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.440
Fourth cousins, four in-betweeners, and a shared great-great-great-grandparent.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.840
According to the rule, you're first cousins, and you connect at your grandparent.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.720
And second cousins share a great-grandparent connection.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.400
Just match the cousin number with the number of Gs, and you're all set.

02:12.400 --> 02:12.800
Simple.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.840
Side note here, continuing this rule in reverse means that siblings can technically call each

02:17.840 --> 02:20.960
other zeroth cousins, which they totally should.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.080
And you are your own negative first cousin?

02:24.080 --> 02:24.640
Weird.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.880
All done here now, nothing more to talk about.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.120
Oh right, the once-removed thing.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.840
You may have noticed these cousins are all on the same level.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.280
Removed just describes how many generations apart people are.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.920
For example, what's the family connection between these two?

02:37.920 --> 02:43.280
Start by taking the smaller cousin number, first cousins, and count the levels apart,

02:43.280 --> 02:44.240
once removed.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.280
These are first cousins twice removed, thrice removed.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.000
And these are second cousins once removed.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.400
Doing all this on our simplified drawing of your descendants is a bit too easy, as most

02:54.400 --> 02:56.320
family trees look more like this.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.320
The rules are still the same, first cousins, second cousins, and the removed, but it is

03:00.320 --> 03:05.200
a bit harder to tell quickly who exactly is your second cousin twice removed, or your

03:05.200 --> 03:06.960
great-grand-aunt-in-law.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.640
To help, there is a chart you can download which will both make it much easier to figure

03:10.640 --> 03:14.640
out what grand-nibbling or cousin-removed you are to anyone at the next family reunion,

03:14.640 --> 03:17.520
and obviously show how cool you are.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.880
Now, we're really done.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.640
Unless you start thinking about the math of all of these family members.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.720
Just how many great-great-great-great-grandparents do you have?

03:26.720 --> 03:27.600
64?

03:27.600 --> 03:32.000
And those great-ex-grandparents had kids, giving you a whole lot of cousins.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.960
This chart happens to stop at tenth cousins, of which you may have more than two thousand?

03:36.960 --> 03:42.400
Which seems like way too many, but these numbers both have big, possibly unsettling asterisks

03:42.400 --> 03:47.040
attached to them, which we will talk about more in Part 2, Family Genetics Explained.
