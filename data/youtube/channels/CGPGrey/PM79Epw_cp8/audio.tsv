0	4960	This is you, this is your family tree, and this is your family tree explained.
4960	7840	You have parents, and your parents have parents.
7840	10880	These are your grandparents, who also have parents.
10880	12320	Your great-grandparents.
12320	14560	Keep adding parents, keep adding greats.
14560	19360	For every G in the name, there is one generation in between you and that person.
19360	22400	Grandparents, one G, one generational in-betweener.
22400	26480	Great-great-great-grandparents, four Gs, four in-betweeners.
26480	29840	Continuing with the basics, you have siblings, and so do your parents.
29840	31760	These are your aunts and uncles.
31760	35040	Up the tree, you may call these people your great-aunts and uncles,
35040	39120	but your grandparents' siblings are really your grand-aunts and uncles.
39120	41920	Greats are reserved for the levels above grand.
41920	46560	Your great-grandparents' siblings are your great-grand-aunts and uncles.
46560	50480	Now, down the tree, your siblings' children are your nieces and nephews,
50480	53520	collectively, niblings, and you are their aunt or uncle.
53520	58320	Their children are your grand-nieces and nephews, and you are their grand-aunt or uncle.
58320	61520	We've gone up and we've gone down, and now it's time to go sideways.
61520	64480	When you get married, you get everyone's favorite, in-laws.
64480	68080	You're on the same level of the family tree as your spouse's siblings.
68080	69680	You're a kind of pseudo-sibling.
69680	73040	All the new family's relationships to you are the same as to your spouse,
73040	74880	but they get the in-law prefix.
74880	77520	It's pretty straightforward, except for one case.
77520	80640	Your spouse's siblings are your siblings-in-law,
80640	84480	but are your siblings-in-law's spouses also your siblings-in-law?
84480	85680	It's a little unclear.
85680	86880	All right, enough with the in-laws.
86880	89600	It's on to the reason you're probably watching this video.
89600	90240	Cousins.
90240	94160	Your aunt and uncle's children are your cousins, but there are many kinds of cousins,
94160	98640	and to better understand them, we need to simplify this family tree and think downward.
98640	101600	Here's you, your children, and your grandchildren.
101600	104880	Your grandchildren are first cousins to each other,
104880	110000	and their children, your great-grandchildren, are second cousins to each other, and so on.
110000	112720	The cousin number is the same as the G-rule.
112720	116800	It tells you how many in-betweeners until the connection on the family tree.
116800	121440	Fourth cousins, four in-betweeners, and a shared great-great-great-grandparent.
121440	125840	According to the rule, you're first cousins, and you connect at your grandparent.
125840	128720	And second cousins share a great-grandparent connection.
128720	132400	Just match the cousin number with the number of Gs, and you're all set.
132400	132800	Simple.
132800	137840	Side note here, continuing this rule in reverse means that siblings can technically call each
137840	140960	other zeroth cousins, which they totally should.
140960	144080	And you are your own negative first cousin?
144080	144640	Weird.
144640	146880	All done here now, nothing more to talk about.
146880	149120	Oh right, the once-removed thing.
149120	151840	You may have noticed these cousins are all on the same level.
151840	155280	Removed just describes how many generations apart people are.
155280	157920	For example, what's the family connection between these two?
157920	163280	Start by taking the smaller cousin number, first cousins, and count the levels apart,
163280	164240	once removed.
164240	167280	These are first cousins twice removed, thrice removed.
167360	170000	And these are second cousins once removed.
170000	174400	Doing all this on our simplified drawing of your descendants is a bit too easy, as most
174400	176320	family trees look more like this.
176320	180320	The rules are still the same, first cousins, second cousins, and the removed, but it is
180320	185200	a bit harder to tell quickly who exactly is your second cousin twice removed, or your
185200	186960	great-grand-aunt-in-law.
186960	190640	To help, there is a chart you can download which will both make it much easier to figure
190640	194640	out what grand-nibbling or cousin-removed you are to anyone at the next family reunion,
194640	197520	and obviously show how cool you are.
197520	198880	Now, we're really done.
198880	202640	Unless you start thinking about the math of all of these family members.
202640	206720	Just how many great-great-great-great-grandparents do you have?
206720	207600	64?
207600	212000	And those great-ex-grandparents had kids, giving you a whole lot of cousins.
212000	216960	This chart happens to stop at tenth cousins, of which you may have more than two thousand?
216960	222400	Which seems like way too many, but these numbers both have big, possibly unsettling asterisks
222400	227040	attached to them, which we will talk about more in Part 2, Family Genetics Explained.
