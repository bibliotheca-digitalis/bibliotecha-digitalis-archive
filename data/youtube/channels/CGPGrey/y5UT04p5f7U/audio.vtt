00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
The story of the penny starts in the first US Mint, founded in 1792, which produced these

00:05.960 --> 00:09.800
one cent pieces along with other coins including the quarter, dime, half-dime and a mystery

00:09.800 --> 00:11.580
coin that we'll get back to later.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.160
These pennies of the New Republic were born of 100% pure copper.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.360
But two forces conspired to ensure this wouldn't remain the case for long.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.280
The value of copper went up and, because of inflation, the buying power of the penny went

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
down.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.000
This caused the mint to reduce the amount of copper in pennies, first from 100% to 95%

00:27.000 --> 00:30.020
and then to only 5% copper and 95% zinc.

00:30.020 --> 00:33.940
Despite this debasement, in 2006 the value of the metal in older pennies rose above one

00:33.940 --> 00:37.560
cent and suddenly they were worth more dead than alive so people melted them to sell the

00:37.560 --> 00:39.120
raw copper for profit.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.280
In a rational, efficient world, the story of the penny would have ended here with the

00:42.280 --> 00:45.680
government realizing that they weren't worth minting and happy that its citizens were removing

00:45.680 --> 00:46.680
them from circulation.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.900
But instead, the government made melting US coins illegal and continues to manufacture

00:50.900 --> 00:55.480
4 million pennies each year, which is idiotic as it cost the US Mint about 1.8 cents to

00:55.480 --> 00:57.320
make each one cent penny.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.960
But even if pennies were minted from something more representative of their true value, like

01:00.960 --> 01:05.120
plastic or lint, it wouldn't fix the fundamental problem that pennies are bad for people and

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
the economy.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Here's why.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.460
The purpose of physical cash money is to make it easy to transact the everyday business

01:10.460 --> 01:11.460
of buying stuff.

01:11.460 --> 01:14.120
A shopkeeper has stuff and you want that stuff.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.700
Rather than bartering like savages for it, you use cash as a medium of exchange.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.760
To get the price just right, the cash must be divisible into pieces so that you don't

01:20.760 --> 01:21.760
overpay.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.880
But it isn't divided forever because at some point the value it represents is too

01:24.880 --> 01:27.120
small to buy anything with or bother with.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.500
Which brings us back to the penny.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.600
In the olden days, pennies could actually buy stuff.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.600
But no more.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.560
Now, if you want to spend pennies, you're going to have to put in some effort.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.800
For example, try to pay for 20 bucks worth of groceries with 2,000 pennies weighing 11

01:38.800 --> 01:40.680
pounds and see how that works out.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.560
So you have to get rid of them using exact change.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.120
But because the United States doesn't include sales tax and prices, unlike more civilized

01:47.120 --> 01:51.880
countries, and you can't multiply by 8.875% in your head, you can't get your change

01:51.880 --> 01:54.860
ready before you reach the register like a good Samaritan would.

01:54.860 --> 01:58.380
The pennies you inevitably fiddle with after discovering the true cost of your goods adds

01:58.380 --> 02:00.800
2 seconds to each cash transaction on average.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.200
Which is less than the value of your time and the time of everyone behind you.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.720
Which is why most normal people don't bother messing with change and the usual penny-pinching

02:07.720 --> 02:10.700
culprits are those with nothing better to occupy their day.

02:10.700 --> 02:14.420
If you want to spend pennies without being an inconsiderate jerk who wastes other people's

02:14.420 --> 02:17.100
time, perhaps you can find a machine that will accept them.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.220
Good luck with that.

02:18.220 --> 02:21.680
Vending machines won't take pennies, neither laundry machines nor tollbooths or parking

02:21.680 --> 02:25.460
meters or anything else because pennies aren't worth the time and effort to count, store

02:25.460 --> 02:26.680
and transport them.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.840
In fact there is only one machine that takes pennies, Coinstar, a leech on the economy

02:30.840 --> 02:35.320
that eats 10% of your money while providing nothing in return except the ability to spend

02:35.320 --> 02:36.960
cash that was already yours.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.060
The difficulty of spending pennies is why they end up in jars, dead to the economy after

02:41.060 --> 02:45.080
a short, useless life where they failed at their only job, to facilitate exchange and

02:45.080 --> 02:49.800
instead do the exact opposite by being a literal dead weight on every cash transaction.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.400
They must be eliminated.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.080
But you might think, won't prices rise and charities lose money without the penny?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.080
No.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.160
New Zealand got rid of their 1 cent coin, as did Oz.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.320
Finland and the Netherlands ditched the 1 euro cent coin as well, though that might

03:01.320 --> 03:05.240
have been because of how absurdly small and frustrating the 1 euro cent is.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.640
These countries round to the nearest 5 cents for cash transactions and none of them saw

03:08.640 --> 03:11.480
prices rise or charitable donations drop.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.520
And anyway, the United States has already gone through this process before without trouble.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.260
Remember the mystery coin from the beginning?

03:17.260 --> 03:18.400
That was the half cent.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
Seen one lately?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
Of course you haven't.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.600
This continued in 1857 for being worth too little.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.920
But when the half cent coin met its fate, it had more buying power than today's dime.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.400
So perhaps the list of modern coins to kill could be even larger.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.840
There is one last, irrational problem with getting rid of the penny.

03:34.840 --> 03:35.840
Everybody loves Lincoln.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.160
Well, almost everybody.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.960
After booting off Lady Liberty and the Chief, the US sure has Lincolnified the penny within

03:40.960 --> 03:42.300
an inch of its life.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.640
But ditching the penny won't erase him from history.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.340
Lincoln and his monument are still in the $5 bill which isn't going away.

03:48.340 --> 03:52.340
And even if you think it's unpatriotic or disrespectful to retire presidential coinage,

03:52.340 --> 03:55.860
allow me to direct you to a little organization known as the United States Military.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.780
Where, in overseas bases, they've already abolished the penny by automatically rounding

03:59.780 --> 04:01.380
to the nearest 5 cents.

04:01.380 --> 04:04.980
Sooner or later, even the most ardent Lincoln lovers will have to give up the penny.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.980
They cost more to make than they're worth, they waste people's time, they don't work

04:07.980 --> 04:12.640
as money and, because of inflation, they're less valuable every year, making all the other

04:12.640 --> 04:13.940
problems worse.

04:13.940 --> 04:16.020
Sorry Abe, but it's time to kill the penny.
