1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
The story of the penny starts in the first US Mint, founded in 1792, which produced these

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,800
one cent pieces along with other coins including the quarter, dime, half-dime and a mystery

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,580
coin that we'll get back to later.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,160
These pennies of the New Republic were born of 100% pure copper.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,360
But two forces conspired to ensure this wouldn't remain the case for long.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,280
The value of copper went up and, because of inflation, the buying power of the penny went

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
down.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,000
This caused the mint to reduce the amount of copper in pennies, first from 100% to 95%

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,020
and then to only 5% copper and 95% zinc.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,940
Despite this debasement, in 2006 the value of the metal in older pennies rose above one

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,560
cent and suddenly they were worth more dead than alive so people melted them to sell the

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,120
raw copper for profit.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,280
In a rational, efficient world, the story of the penny would have ended here with the

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,680
government realizing that they weren't worth minting and happy that its citizens were removing

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
them from circulation.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,900
But instead, the government made melting US coins illegal and continues to manufacture

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,480
4 million pennies each year, which is idiotic as it cost the US Mint about 1.8 cents to

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,320
make each one cent penny.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,960
But even if pennies were minted from something more representative of their true value, like

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,120
plastic or lint, it wouldn't fix the fundamental problem that pennies are bad for people and

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
the economy.

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Here's why.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,460
The purpose of physical cash money is to make it easy to transact the everyday business

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
of buying stuff.

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,120
A shopkeeper has stuff and you want that stuff.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,700
Rather than bartering like savages for it, you use cash as a medium of exchange.

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,760
To get the price just right, the cash must be divisible into pieces so that you don't

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
overpay.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,880
But it isn't divided forever because at some point the value it represents is too

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,120
small to buy anything with or bother with.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,500
Which brings us back to the penny.

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,600
In the olden days, pennies could actually buy stuff.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
But no more.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Now, if you want to spend pennies, you're going to have to put in some effort.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,800
For example, try to pay for 20 bucks worth of groceries with 2,000 pennies weighing 11

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,680
pounds and see how that works out.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,560
So you have to get rid of them using exact change.

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,120
But because the United States doesn't include sales tax and prices, unlike more civilized

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,880
countries, and you can't multiply by 8.875% in your head, you can't get your change

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,860
ready before you reach the register like a good Samaritan would.

41
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,380
The pennies you inevitably fiddle with after discovering the true cost of your goods adds

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,800
2 seconds to each cash transaction on average.

43
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Which is less than the value of your time and the time of everyone behind you.

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,720
Which is why most normal people don't bother messing with change and the usual penny-pinching

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,700
culprits are those with nothing better to occupy their day.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,420
If you want to spend pennies without being an inconsiderate jerk who wastes other people's

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,100
time, perhaps you can find a machine that will accept them.

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,220
Good luck with that.

49
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,680
Vending machines won't take pennies, neither laundry machines nor tollbooths or parking

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,460
meters or anything else because pennies aren't worth the time and effort to count, store

51
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,680
and transport them.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,840
In fact there is only one machine that takes pennies, Coinstar, a leech on the economy

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,320
that eats 10% of your money while providing nothing in return except the ability to spend

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,960
cash that was already yours.

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,060
The difficulty of spending pennies is why they end up in jars, dead to the economy after

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,080
a short, useless life where they failed at their only job, to facilitate exchange and

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,800
instead do the exact opposite by being a literal dead weight on every cash transaction.

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
They must be eliminated.

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,080
But you might think, won't prices rise and charities lose money without the penny?

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
No.

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,160
New Zealand got rid of their 1 cent coin, as did Oz.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,320
Finland and the Netherlands ditched the 1 euro cent coin as well, though that might

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,240
have been because of how absurdly small and frustrating the 1 euro cent is.

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,640
These countries round to the nearest 5 cents for cash transactions and none of them saw

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,480
prices rise or charitable donations drop.

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,520
And anyway, the United States has already gone through this process before without trouble.

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,260
Remember the mystery coin from the beginning?

68
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,400
That was the half cent.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Seen one lately?

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Of course you haven't.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
This continued in 1857 for being worth too little.

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,920
But when the half cent coin met its fate, it had more buying power than today's dime.

73
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,400
So perhaps the list of modern coins to kill could be even larger.

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,840
There is one last, irrational problem with getting rid of the penny.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Everybody loves Lincoln.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
Well, almost everybody.

77
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,960
After booting off Lady Liberty and the Chief, the US sure has Lincolnified the penny within

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,300
an inch of its life.

79
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,640
But ditching the penny won't erase him from history.

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,340
Lincoln and his monument are still in the $5 bill which isn't going away.

81
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,340
And even if you think it's unpatriotic or disrespectful to retire presidential coinage,

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,860
allow me to direct you to a little organization known as the United States Military.

83
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,780
Where, in overseas bases, they've already abolished the penny by automatically rounding

84
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,380
to the nearest 5 cents.

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,980
Sooner or later, even the most ardent Lincoln lovers will have to give up the penny.

86
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,980
They cost more to make than they're worth, they waste people's time, they don't work

87
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,640
as money and, because of inflation, they're less valuable every year, making all the other

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,940
problems worse.

89
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,020
Sorry Abe, but it's time to kill the penny.
