0	5960	The story of the penny starts in the first US Mint, founded in 1792, which produced these
5960	9800	one cent pieces along with other coins including the quarter, dime, half-dime and a mystery
9800	11580	coin that we'll get back to later.
11580	15160	These pennies of the New Republic were born of 100% pure copper.
15160	18360	But two forces conspired to ensure this wouldn't remain the case for long.
18360	22280	The value of copper went up and, because of inflation, the buying power of the penny went
22280	23280	down.
23280	27000	This caused the mint to reduce the amount of copper in pennies, first from 100% to 95%
27000	30020	and then to only 5% copper and 95% zinc.
30020	33940	Despite this debasement, in 2006 the value of the metal in older pennies rose above one
33940	37560	cent and suddenly they were worth more dead than alive so people melted them to sell the
37560	39120	raw copper for profit.
39120	42280	In a rational, efficient world, the story of the penny would have ended here with the
42280	45680	government realizing that they weren't worth minting and happy that its citizens were removing
45680	46680	them from circulation.
46680	50900	But instead, the government made melting US coins illegal and continues to manufacture
50900	55480	4 million pennies each year, which is idiotic as it cost the US Mint about 1.8 cents to
55480	57320	make each one cent penny.
57320	60960	But even if pennies were minted from something more representative of their true value, like
60960	65120	plastic or lint, it wouldn't fix the fundamental problem that pennies are bad for people and
65120	66120	the economy.
66120	67120	Here's why.
67120	70460	The purpose of physical cash money is to make it easy to transact the everyday business
70460	71460	of buying stuff.
71460	74120	A shopkeeper has stuff and you want that stuff.
74120	77700	Rather than bartering like savages for it, you use cash as a medium of exchange.
77700	80760	To get the price just right, the cash must be divisible into pieces so that you don't
80760	81760	overpay.
81760	84880	But it isn't divided forever because at some point the value it represents is too
84880	87120	small to buy anything with or bother with.
87120	88500	Which brings us back to the penny.
88500	90600	In the olden days, pennies could actually buy stuff.
90600	91600	But no more.
91600	94560	Now, if you want to spend pennies, you're going to have to put in some effort.
94560	98800	For example, try to pay for 20 bucks worth of groceries with 2,000 pennies weighing 11
98800	100680	pounds and see how that works out.
100680	103560	So you have to get rid of them using exact change.
103560	107120	But because the United States doesn't include sales tax and prices, unlike more civilized
107120	111880	countries, and you can't multiply by 8.875% in your head, you can't get your change
111880	114860	ready before you reach the register like a good Samaritan would.
114860	118380	The pennies you inevitably fiddle with after discovering the true cost of your goods adds
118380	120800	2 seconds to each cash transaction on average.
120800	124200	Which is less than the value of your time and the time of everyone behind you.
124200	127720	Which is why most normal people don't bother messing with change and the usual penny-pinching
127720	130700	culprits are those with nothing better to occupy their day.
130700	134420	If you want to spend pennies without being an inconsiderate jerk who wastes other people's
134420	137100	time, perhaps you can find a machine that will accept them.
137100	138220	Good luck with that.
138220	141680	Vending machines won't take pennies, neither laundry machines nor tollbooths or parking
141680	145460	meters or anything else because pennies aren't worth the time and effort to count, store
145460	146680	and transport them.
146680	150840	In fact there is only one machine that takes pennies, Coinstar, a leech on the economy
150840	155320	that eats 10% of your money while providing nothing in return except the ability to spend
155320	156960	cash that was already yours.
156960	161060	The difficulty of spending pennies is why they end up in jars, dead to the economy after
161060	165080	a short, useless life where they failed at their only job, to facilitate exchange and
165080	169800	instead do the exact opposite by being a literal dead weight on every cash transaction.
169800	171400	They must be eliminated.
171400	175080	But you might think, won't prices rise and charities lose money without the penny?
175080	176080	No.
176080	178160	New Zealand got rid of their 1 cent coin, as did Oz.
178160	181320	Finland and the Netherlands ditched the 1 euro cent coin as well, though that might
181320	185240	have been because of how absurdly small and frustrating the 1 euro cent is.
185240	188640	These countries round to the nearest 5 cents for cash transactions and none of them saw
188640	191480	prices rise or charitable donations drop.
191480	195520	And anyway, the United States has already gone through this process before without trouble.
195520	197260	Remember the mystery coin from the beginning?
197260	198400	That was the half cent.
198400	199400	Seen one lately?
199400	200400	Of course you haven't.
200400	203600	This continued in 1857 for being worth too little.
203600	207920	But when the half cent coin met its fate, it had more buying power than today's dime.
207920	211400	So perhaps the list of modern coins to kill could be even larger.
211400	214840	There is one last, irrational problem with getting rid of the penny.
214840	215840	Everybody loves Lincoln.
215840	217160	Well, almost everybody.
217160	220960	After booting off Lady Liberty and the Chief, the US sure has Lincolnified the penny within
220960	222300	an inch of its life.
222300	224640	But ditching the penny won't erase him from history.
224640	228340	Lincoln and his monument are still in the $5 bill which isn't going away.
228340	232340	And even if you think it's unpatriotic or disrespectful to retire presidential coinage,
232340	235860	allow me to direct you to a little organization known as the United States Military.
235860	239780	Where, in overseas bases, they've already abolished the penny by automatically rounding
239780	241380	to the nearest 5 cents.
241380	244980	Sooner or later, even the most ardent Lincoln lovers will have to give up the penny.
244980	247980	They cost more to make than they're worth, they waste people's time, they don't work
247980	252640	as money and, because of inflation, they're less valuable every year, making all the other
252640	253940	problems worse.
253940	256020	Sorry Abe, but it's time to kill the penny.
