0	1520	Hello internet.
1520	5320	I want to talk about Canada who, this week, made my reasons to like her list one item
5320	7720	longer by deciding to abolish the penny.
7720	10860	Since I previously made a video called Death to Pennies, it should come as no surprise
10860	13240	that this move gets a big go Canada from me.
13240	17020	So let's take a moment to cheer Canada for her economic rationalism, look at how getting
17020	20480	rid of a coin works in practice, and remind her sister to the south why she might want
20480	21480	to do the same.
21480	25220	Canada's plan is pretty simple, in a couple months the Royal Canadian Mint will switch
25220	27640	the penny making machine from on to off.
27640	28640	That's it.
28640	31040	Pretty much nothing else in the world is going to change.
31040	33920	Pennies will still be legal tender in Canada, so that jar of several hundred that you'll
33920	37400	never bother to count will always be worth just as much as it is today.
37400	40480	And in shops there will still be that person who pays with exact change.
40480	44040	But after they've tediously counted out their precious, worthless pennies, the shop will
44040	47080	send them back to the Royal Canadian Mint to be melted down.
47080	51240	Thus the supply of pennies will slowly decrease over time in a pleasant half-life curve.
51240	55280	But while the penny will functionally go away, prices listed in 1 cent intervals will not.
55280	58180	Your coffee and timbits will still cost the same and when you get to the cash register
58220	61340	the total amount after tax will still have single cents.
61340	64880	If you pay by card, that exact amount will be deducted from your account.
64880	68240	The only difference is if you pay in cash, not card, and you don't have any pennies with
68240	72580	which to waste everyone else's time then the price will be rounded to the nearest 5 cents.
72580	76500	Of course in rounding sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, but, and this is the rather
76500	81100	salient point, either way a 1 or 2 cent difference just isn't worth caring about.
81100	84240	Which is why Canada can safely jettison the penny in the first place.
84240	87500	Inevitably though, this is the point in the discussion when pro-penny people propose that
87500	91140	ditching the worthless coin will make prices go up and your savings go down.
91140	94580	But the evidence for this claim is non-existent because many countries have done this before
94580	95980	with no ill effect.
95980	100060	Sure coin collectors and inefficiency fans will be sad to see the penny go, but overall
100060	103500	it's a big win for Canada because printing money isn't free.
103500	106520	The cost to make a 1 cent penny is 1.6 cents.
106520	110940	So every year when Canada visited the Mint she spent 29 million dollars to buy 18 million
110940	115220	dollars worth of pennies, effectively throwing away 11 million dollars a year.
115220	119100	Now obviously ditching pennies won't single-handedly balance the budget, but it's the easiest,
119100	120940	most rational place to start.
120940	123860	Congratulations Canada, may others follow in your path.
123860	124860	P.S.
124860	128220	If you want to know more about why the United States in particular should get rid of pennies,
128220	131860	you can either watch my video on the topic or listen to fellow penny hater John Green
131860	136760	get arm-wavingly angry about not only pennies, but also nickels which are even worse.
136760	139620	Also there should be a new main video up in the next week or two, but if you want to help
139620	143040	me make them faster, you can go here on my website to help out with the fact-checking
143040	144460	for upcoming projects.
144460	145140	Thanks for watching!
