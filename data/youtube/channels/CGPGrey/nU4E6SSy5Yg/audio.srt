Hello internet.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,320
I want to talk about Canada who, this week, made my reasons to like her list one item

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,720
longer by deciding to abolish the penny.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,860
Since I previously made a video called Death to Pennies, it should come as no surprise

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,240
that this move gets a big go Canada from me.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,020
So let's take a moment to cheer Canada for her economic rationalism, look at how getting

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,480
rid of a coin works in practice, and remind her sister to the south why she might want

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
to do the same.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,220
Canada's plan is pretty simple, in a couple months the Royal Canadian Mint will switch

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,640
the penny making machine from on to off.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
That's it.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,040
Pretty much nothing else in the world is going to change.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,920
Pennies will still be legal tender in Canada, so that jar of several hundred that you'll

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,400
never bother to count will always be worth just as much as it is today.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,480
And in shops there will still be that person who pays with exact change.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,040
But after they've tediously counted out their precious, worthless pennies, the shop will

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,080
send them back to the Royal Canadian Mint to be melted down.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,240
Thus the supply of pennies will slowly decrease over time in a pleasant half-life curve.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,280
But while the penny will functionally go away, prices listed in 1 cent intervals will not.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,180
Your coffee and timbits will still cost the same and when you get to the cash register

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,340
the total amount after tax will still have single cents.

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,880
If you pay by card, that exact amount will be deducted from your account.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,240
The only difference is if you pay in cash, not card, and you don't have any pennies with

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,580
which to waste everyone else's time then the price will be rounded to the nearest 5 cents.

25
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,500
Of course in rounding sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, but, and this is the rather

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,100
salient point, either way a 1 or 2 cent difference just isn't worth caring about.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,240
Which is why Canada can safely jettison the penny in the first place.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,500
Inevitably though, this is the point in the discussion when pro-penny people propose that

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,140
ditching the worthless coin will make prices go up and your savings go down.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,580
But the evidence for this claim is non-existent because many countries have done this before

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,980
with no ill effect.

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,060
Sure coin collectors and inefficiency fans will be sad to see the penny go, but overall

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,500
it's a big win for Canada because printing money isn't free.

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,520
The cost to make a 1 cent penny is 1.6 cents.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,940
So every year when Canada visited the Mint she spent 29 million dollars to buy 18 million

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,220
dollars worth of pennies, effectively throwing away 11 million dollars a year.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,100
Now obviously ditching pennies won't single-handedly balance the budget, but it's the easiest,

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,940
most rational place to start.

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,860
Congratulations Canada, may others follow in your path.

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
P.S.

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,220
If you want to know more about why the United States in particular should get rid of pennies,

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,860
you can either watch my video on the topic or listen to fellow penny hater John Green

43
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,760
get arm-wavingly angry about not only pennies, but also nickels which are even worse.

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,620
Also there should be a new main video up in the next week or two, but if you want to help

45
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,040
me make them faster, you can go here on my website to help out with the fact-checking

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,460
for upcoming projects.

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,140
Thanks for watching!
