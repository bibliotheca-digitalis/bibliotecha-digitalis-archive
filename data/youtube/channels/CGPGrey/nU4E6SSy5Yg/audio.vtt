Hello internet.

00:01.520 --> 00:05.320
I want to talk about Canada who, this week, made my reasons to like her list one item

00:05.320 --> 00:07.720
longer by deciding to abolish the penny.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.860
Since I previously made a video called Death to Pennies, it should come as no surprise

00:10.860 --> 00:13.240
that this move gets a big go Canada from me.

00:13.240 --> 00:17.020
So let's take a moment to cheer Canada for her economic rationalism, look at how getting

00:17.020 --> 00:20.480
rid of a coin works in practice, and remind her sister to the south why she might want

00:20.480 --> 00:21.480
to do the same.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.220
Canada's plan is pretty simple, in a couple months the Royal Canadian Mint will switch

00:25.220 --> 00:27.640
the penny making machine from on to off.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.640
That's it.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.040
Pretty much nothing else in the world is going to change.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.920
Pennies will still be legal tender in Canada, so that jar of several hundred that you'll

00:33.920 --> 00:37.400
never bother to count will always be worth just as much as it is today.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.480
And in shops there will still be that person who pays with exact change.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.040
But after they've tediously counted out their precious, worthless pennies, the shop will

00:44.040 --> 00:47.080
send them back to the Royal Canadian Mint to be melted down.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.240
Thus the supply of pennies will slowly decrease over time in a pleasant half-life curve.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.280
But while the penny will functionally go away, prices listed in 1 cent intervals will not.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.180
Your coffee and timbits will still cost the same and when you get to the cash register

00:58.220 --> 01:01.340
the total amount after tax will still have single cents.

01:01.340 --> 01:04.880
If you pay by card, that exact amount will be deducted from your account.

01:04.880 --> 01:08.240
The only difference is if you pay in cash, not card, and you don't have any pennies with

01:08.240 --> 01:12.580
which to waste everyone else's time then the price will be rounded to the nearest 5 cents.

01:12.580 --> 01:16.500
Of course in rounding sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, but, and this is the rather

01:16.500 --> 01:21.100
salient point, either way a 1 or 2 cent difference just isn't worth caring about.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.240
Which is why Canada can safely jettison the penny in the first place.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.500
Inevitably though, this is the point in the discussion when pro-penny people propose that

01:27.500 --> 01:31.140
ditching the worthless coin will make prices go up and your savings go down.

01:31.140 --> 01:34.580
But the evidence for this claim is non-existent because many countries have done this before

01:34.580 --> 01:35.980
with no ill effect.

01:35.980 --> 01:40.060
Sure coin collectors and inefficiency fans will be sad to see the penny go, but overall

01:40.060 --> 01:43.500
it's a big win for Canada because printing money isn't free.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.520
The cost to make a 1 cent penny is 1.6 cents.

01:46.520 --> 01:50.940
So every year when Canada visited the Mint she spent 29 million dollars to buy 18 million

01:50.940 --> 01:55.220
dollars worth of pennies, effectively throwing away 11 million dollars a year.

01:55.220 --> 01:59.100
Now obviously ditching pennies won't single-handedly balance the budget, but it's the easiest,

01:59.100 --> 02:00.940
most rational place to start.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.860
Congratulations Canada, may others follow in your path.

02:03.860 --> 02:04.860
P.S.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.220
If you want to know more about why the United States in particular should get rid of pennies,

02:08.220 --> 02:11.860
you can either watch my video on the topic or listen to fellow penny hater John Green

02:11.860 --> 02:16.760
get arm-wavingly angry about not only pennies, but also nickels which are even worse.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.620
Also there should be a new main video up in the next week or two, but if you want to help

02:19.620 --> 02:23.040
me make them faster, you can go here on my website to help out with the fact-checking

02:23.040 --> 02:24.460
for upcoming projects.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.140
Thanks for watching!
