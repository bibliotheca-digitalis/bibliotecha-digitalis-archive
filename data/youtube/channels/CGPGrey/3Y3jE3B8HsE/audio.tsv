0	4080	Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is displeased.
4080	7400	She recently introduced elections for the office of king using the first-past-the-post
7400	8400	voting system.
8400	12720	While her realm started out as a healthy democracy with many parties running candidates for king,
12720	16720	it quickly devolved into two-party rule with the citizens not liking either one, but trapped
16720	19720	within the system because of a problem called the spoiler effect.
19720	23800	However, one of Queen Lion's subjects from a distant land, Wallaby, has a solution – the
23800	24800	alternative vote.
24800	25800	What's the difference?
26200	30600	To find out, let's follow one voter on election day, Red Squirrel, under both systems.
30600	35040	There are five candidates running for king – two members of the big parties, Gorilla
35040	39180	and Leopard, and three other candidates, Turtle, Owl, and Tiger.
39180	43320	Under first-past-the-post, Red Squirrel gets a ballot where he picks just one candidate.
43320	45960	Red Squirrel really likes Turtle and even campaigned for him.
45960	49880	However, he knows that his new neighbor, Gray Squirrel, is voting Gorilla.
49880	53160	And what, starts to wonder, Red Squirrel, about all the other animals?
53160	54820	Who are they going to vote for?
54820	58300	The debates on the Animal News Network only had the big parties, so Red Squirrel thinks
58300	61380	it's going to be a close race between Gorilla and Leopard.
61380	64820	While he's indifferent toward Gorilla, he's deathly afraid of Leopard.
64820	67860	Because he can only pick a single candidate, he gives his one vote to Gorilla in hopes
67860	70380	of preventing Leopard from becoming king.
70380	74740	This is strategic voting, and it's a necessity under first-past-the-post.
74740	78620	But now let's look at the alternative vote, which Wallaby explains to Red Squirrel.
78620	82440	Instead of picking one, and only one, candidate, he can rank them in order of his most favorite
82440	83780	to his least.
83780	86940	He goes into the voting booth and gets the same ballot as before, but now puts Turtle
86940	91020	as his first choice, Owl as his second, and Gorilla as his third.
91020	94260	He dislikes Leopard and Tiger equally, so he stops filling in his ballot and drops it
94260	95260	in the box.
95260	97660	At this point, Red Squirrel doesn't care exactly what happens.
97660	100100	He has other things on his mind, and he heads off.
100100	104660	But you, dear citizen, want to know how the votes are counted, so here goes.
104660	108300	Turtle, beloved though he is with some of the citizenry, comes in last place with only
108300	111720	5%, and he is eliminated from the race.
111720	114120	Because the voters rank their candidates in order, we can know what would have happened
114120	116000	if Turtle didn't run.
116000	119240	Without Turtle, voters like Red Squirrel would have picked Owl instead, so their votes are
119240	123200	transferred to her, as though Turtle was never in the race at all.
123200	125840	This is why the alternative vote is sometimes called instant runoff voting.
125840	129500	It's able to simulate a bunch of elections where the least popular candidate is eliminated
129500	133400	after each round, without all the time and expense it would take to run a bunch of campaigns
133400	135800	one after another.
135800	138920	The alternative vote method keeps eliminating the least popular candidate until someone
138920	142000	either wins a majority or only one is left.
142000	146080	As no one has a majority yet, the next lowest candidate, Tiger, is eliminated.
146080	150360	Tiger voters listed Leopard as their second choice, so she gets Tiger's vote.
150360	152280	In the last round, Gorilla is eliminated.
152280	156600	Gorilla voters listed Owl as their second choice, so Owl gets those votes, wins a majority,
156600	158560	and is crowned king.
158560	161900	The alternative vote is a better system because it produces winners that a larger number of
161900	163680	voters can agree on.
163680	167440	While the alternative vote does have its flaws, it's important to note that any problem AV
167440	169680	has, First Past the Post also shares.
169680	174160	They're both susceptible to gerrymandering, they aren't proportional systems, they can't
174160	178880	guarantee a Condorcet winner, which math geeks hate but there isn't time to explain here,
178880	181680	and over time they both trend towards two parties.
181680	185220	That being said, alternative vote has a huge advantage that First Past the Post lacks and
185220	187100	makes it mathematically superior.
187100	189240	No spoiler effect.
189240	191140	Imagine one final election.
191140	195680	Two big candidates are running, Gorilla and Leopard, and Leopard looks set to win 55-45,
195680	199440	but then a third party candidate, Tiger, enters.
199440	203400	Tiger manages to convince 15% of the Leopard voters to back him instead.
203400	207040	Under First Past the Post, Gorilla now wins, even though a majority of the voters didn't
207040	208460	want him.
208460	212060	Under the alternative vote, because all Tiger voters put Leopard as a second choice, Leopard
212060	215580	still wins because a majority of the citizens of the animal kingdom would rather have her
215580	217680	in charge than Gorilla.
217680	221120	Using the alternative vote, citizens can help support and grow smaller parties that they
221120	225680	agree with, without worrying that they'll put someone they don't like into office.
225680	229440	After examining the differences between them, Queen Lion decrees that the alternative vote
229440	233280	is to be the rule of the land for electing the king and everyone is happier.
233280	235360	Well, almost everyone.
235360	238960	The two big parties can't be as complacent as they used to be and need to campaign much
238960	242800	harder to convince their voters to support them.
242800	245840	This has been the alternative vote explained by me, CGP Grey.
245840	246840	Thank you very much for watching.
251120	266240	I'll see you next time.
