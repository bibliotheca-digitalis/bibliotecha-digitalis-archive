00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is displeased.

00:04.080 --> 00:07.400
She recently introduced elections for the office of king using the first-past-the-post

00:07.400 --> 00:08.400
voting system.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.720
While her realm started out as a healthy democracy with many parties running candidates for king,

00:12.720 --> 00:16.720
it quickly devolved into two-party rule with the citizens not liking either one, but trapped

00:16.720 --> 00:19.720
within the system because of a problem called the spoiler effect.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.800
However, one of Queen Lion's subjects from a distant land, Wallaby, has a solution – the

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
alternative vote.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
What's the difference?

00:26.200 --> 00:30.600
To find out, let's follow one voter on election day, Red Squirrel, under both systems.

00:30.600 --> 00:35.040
There are five candidates running for king – two members of the big parties, Gorilla

00:35.040 --> 00:39.180
and Leopard, and three other candidates, Turtle, Owl, and Tiger.

00:39.180 --> 00:43.320
Under first-past-the-post, Red Squirrel gets a ballot where he picks just one candidate.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.960
Red Squirrel really likes Turtle and even campaigned for him.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.880
However, he knows that his new neighbor, Gray Squirrel, is voting Gorilla.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.160
And what, starts to wonder, Red Squirrel, about all the other animals?

00:53.160 --> 00:54.820
Who are they going to vote for?

00:54.820 --> 00:58.300
The debates on the Animal News Network only had the big parties, so Red Squirrel thinks

00:58.300 --> 01:01.380
it's going to be a close race between Gorilla and Leopard.

01:01.380 --> 01:04.820
While he's indifferent toward Gorilla, he's deathly afraid of Leopard.

01:04.820 --> 01:07.860
Because he can only pick a single candidate, he gives his one vote to Gorilla in hopes

01:07.860 --> 01:10.380
of preventing Leopard from becoming king.

01:10.380 --> 01:14.740
This is strategic voting, and it's a necessity under first-past-the-post.

01:14.740 --> 01:18.620
But now let's look at the alternative vote, which Wallaby explains to Red Squirrel.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.440
Instead of picking one, and only one, candidate, he can rank them in order of his most favorite

01:22.440 --> 01:23.780
to his least.

01:23.780 --> 01:26.940
He goes into the voting booth and gets the same ballot as before, but now puts Turtle

01:26.940 --> 01:31.020
as his first choice, Owl as his second, and Gorilla as his third.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.260
He dislikes Leopard and Tiger equally, so he stops filling in his ballot and drops it

01:34.260 --> 01:35.260
in the box.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.660
At this point, Red Squirrel doesn't care exactly what happens.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.100
He has other things on his mind, and he heads off.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.660
But you, dear citizen, want to know how the votes are counted, so here goes.

01:44.660 --> 01:48.300
Turtle, beloved though he is with some of the citizenry, comes in last place with only

01:48.300 --> 01:51.720
5%, and he is eliminated from the race.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.120
Because the voters rank their candidates in order, we can know what would have happened

01:54.120 --> 01:56.000
if Turtle didn't run.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.240
Without Turtle, voters like Red Squirrel would have picked Owl instead, so their votes are

01:59.240 --> 02:03.200
transferred to her, as though Turtle was never in the race at all.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.840
This is why the alternative vote is sometimes called instant runoff voting.

02:05.840 --> 02:09.500
It's able to simulate a bunch of elections where the least popular candidate is eliminated

02:09.500 --> 02:13.400
after each round, without all the time and expense it would take to run a bunch of campaigns

02:13.400 --> 02:15.800
one after another.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.920
The alternative vote method keeps eliminating the least popular candidate until someone

02:18.920 --> 02:22.000
either wins a majority or only one is left.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.080
As no one has a majority yet, the next lowest candidate, Tiger, is eliminated.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.360
Tiger voters listed Leopard as their second choice, so she gets Tiger's vote.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.280
In the last round, Gorilla is eliminated.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.600
Gorilla voters listed Owl as their second choice, so Owl gets those votes, wins a majority,

02:36.600 --> 02:38.560
and is crowned king.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.900
The alternative vote is a better system because it produces winners that a larger number of

02:41.900 --> 02:43.680
voters can agree on.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.440
While the alternative vote does have its flaws, it's important to note that any problem AV

02:47.440 --> 02:49.680
has, First Past the Post also shares.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.160
They're both susceptible to gerrymandering, they aren't proportional systems, they can't

02:54.160 --> 02:58.880
guarantee a Condorcet winner, which math geeks hate but there isn't time to explain here,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.680
and over time they both trend towards two parties.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.220
That being said, alternative vote has a huge advantage that First Past the Post lacks and

03:05.220 --> 03:07.100
makes it mathematically superior.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.240
No spoiler effect.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.140
Imagine one final election.

03:11.140 --> 03:15.680
Two big candidates are running, Gorilla and Leopard, and Leopard looks set to win 55-45,

03:15.680 --> 03:19.440
but then a third party candidate, Tiger, enters.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.400
Tiger manages to convince 15% of the Leopard voters to back him instead.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.040
Under First Past the Post, Gorilla now wins, even though a majority of the voters didn't

03:27.040 --> 03:28.460
want him.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.060
Under the alternative vote, because all Tiger voters put Leopard as a second choice, Leopard

03:32.060 --> 03:35.580
still wins because a majority of the citizens of the animal kingdom would rather have her

03:35.580 --> 03:37.680
in charge than Gorilla.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.120
Using the alternative vote, citizens can help support and grow smaller parties that they

03:41.120 --> 03:45.680
agree with, without worrying that they'll put someone they don't like into office.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.440
After examining the differences between them, Queen Lion decrees that the alternative vote

03:49.440 --> 03:53.280
is to be the rule of the land for electing the king and everyone is happier.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.360
Well, almost everyone.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.960
The two big parties can't be as complacent as they used to be and need to campaign much

03:58.960 --> 04:02.800
harder to convince their voters to support them.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.840
This has been the alternative vote explained by me, CGP Grey.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
Thank you very much for watching.

04:11.120 --> 04:26.240
I'll see you next time.
