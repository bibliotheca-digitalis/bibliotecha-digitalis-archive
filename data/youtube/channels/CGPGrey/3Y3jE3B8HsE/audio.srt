1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is displeased.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,400
She recently introduced elections for the office of king using the first-past-the-post

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
voting system.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,720
While her realm started out as a healthy democracy with many parties running candidates for king,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,720
it quickly devolved into two-party rule with the citizens not liking either one, but trapped

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,720
within the system because of a problem called the spoiler effect.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,800
However, one of Queen Lion's subjects from a distant land, Wallaby, has a solution – the

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
alternative vote.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
What's the difference?

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,600
To find out, let's follow one voter on election day, Red Squirrel, under both systems.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,040
There are five candidates running for king – two members of the big parties, Gorilla

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,180
and Leopard, and three other candidates, Turtle, Owl, and Tiger.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,320
Under first-past-the-post, Red Squirrel gets a ballot where he picks just one candidate.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,960
Red Squirrel really likes Turtle and even campaigned for him.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,880
However, he knows that his new neighbor, Gray Squirrel, is voting Gorilla.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,160
And what, starts to wonder, Red Squirrel, about all the other animals?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,820
Who are they going to vote for?

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,300
The debates on the Animal News Network only had the big parties, so Red Squirrel thinks

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,380
it's going to be a close race between Gorilla and Leopard.

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,820
While he's indifferent toward Gorilla, he's deathly afraid of Leopard.

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,860
Because he can only pick a single candidate, he gives his one vote to Gorilla in hopes

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,380
of preventing Leopard from becoming king.

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,740
This is strategic voting, and it's a necessity under first-past-the-post.

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,620
But now let's look at the alternative vote, which Wallaby explains to Red Squirrel.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,440
Instead of picking one, and only one, candidate, he can rank them in order of his most favorite

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,780
to his least.

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,940
He goes into the voting booth and gets the same ballot as before, but now puts Turtle

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,020
as his first choice, Owl as his second, and Gorilla as his third.

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,260
He dislikes Leopard and Tiger equally, so he stops filling in his ballot and drops it

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,260
in the box.

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,660
At this point, Red Squirrel doesn't care exactly what happens.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,100
He has other things on his mind, and he heads off.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,660
But you, dear citizen, want to know how the votes are counted, so here goes.

34
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,300
Turtle, beloved though he is with some of the citizenry, comes in last place with only

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,720
5%, and he is eliminated from the race.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,120
Because the voters rank their candidates in order, we can know what would have happened

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,000
if Turtle didn't run.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,240
Without Turtle, voters like Red Squirrel would have picked Owl instead, so their votes are

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,200
transferred to her, as though Turtle was never in the race at all.

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,840
This is why the alternative vote is sometimes called instant runoff voting.

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,500
It's able to simulate a bunch of elections where the least popular candidate is eliminated

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,400
after each round, without all the time and expense it would take to run a bunch of campaigns

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,800
one after another.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,920
The alternative vote method keeps eliminating the least popular candidate until someone

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,000
either wins a majority or only one is left.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
As no one has a majority yet, the next lowest candidate, Tiger, is eliminated.

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,360
Tiger voters listed Leopard as their second choice, so she gets Tiger's vote.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
In the last round, Gorilla is eliminated.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,600
Gorilla voters listed Owl as their second choice, so Owl gets those votes, wins a majority,

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,560
and is crowned king.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,900
The alternative vote is a better system because it produces winners that a larger number of

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,680
voters can agree on.

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
While the alternative vote does have its flaws, it's important to note that any problem AV

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
has, First Past the Post also shares.

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,160
They're both susceptible to gerrymandering, they aren't proportional systems, they can't

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,880
guarantee a Condorcet winner, which math geeks hate but there isn't time to explain here,

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,680
and over time they both trend towards two parties.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,220
That being said, alternative vote has a huge advantage that First Past the Post lacks and

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,100
makes it mathematically superior.

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,240
No spoiler effect.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,140
Imagine one final election.

62
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,680
Two big candidates are running, Gorilla and Leopard, and Leopard looks set to win 55-45,

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,440
but then a third party candidate, Tiger, enters.

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,400
Tiger manages to convince 15% of the Leopard voters to back him instead.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,040
Under First Past the Post, Gorilla now wins, even though a majority of the voters didn't

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,460
want him.

67
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,060
Under the alternative vote, because all Tiger voters put Leopard as a second choice, Leopard

68
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,580
still wins because a majority of the citizens of the animal kingdom would rather have her

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,680
in charge than Gorilla.

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
Using the alternative vote, citizens can help support and grow smaller parties that they

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
agree with, without worrying that they'll put someone they don't like into office.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
After examining the differences between them, Queen Lion decrees that the alternative vote

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,280
is to be the rule of the land for electing the king and everyone is happier.

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
Well, almost everyone.

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,960
The two big parties can't be as complacent as they used to be and need to campaign much

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,800
harder to convince their voters to support them.

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,840
This has been the alternative vote explained by me, CGP Grey.

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Thank you very much for watching.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:26,240
I'll see you next time.
