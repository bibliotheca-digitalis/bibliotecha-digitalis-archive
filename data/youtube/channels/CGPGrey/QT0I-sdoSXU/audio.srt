00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is looking to improve her democracy.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
She recently allowed citizens to elect representatives to the Jungle Council,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
which governs the kingdom. However, she recognizes that her citizens

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,760
are not happy with the voting system. Let's watch an election on one of the

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,920
small islands of her kingdom to see why. On this island there are three political

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
parties. The two big ones, Kia and Tuatara, and a small third party,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
Kakapo. On election day the citizens each cast

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
one vote for a local candidate they want to represent the range they live in.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,920
The results are as follows, with the average across the island that Tuatara

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,400
gets 49%, Kia gets 48%, and Kakapo gets 3%.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,760
The election is run using first past the post, meaning that the candidate with the

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,040
most votes wins. Because Tuatara got the most votes in

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,400
each range, they get to control 100% of the seats on the council.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,920
And this is why so many citizens are unhappy. The majority of them,

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
the 51% who voted for other parties, get no representation on the council at all.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,760
This seems unfair to Queen Lion, but she's not sure how to fix it.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,560
The citizens like having local representatives and don't want to

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,240
change the range boundaries. But luckily Kiwi, one of the citizens of

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,440
this island, has a suggestion for Queen Lion on how she can make the system

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,760
better while keeping local representation and

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
leaving the ranges as they are. The idea is called Mixed Member

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,040
Proportional, or MMP, and it makes two changes. The number of

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,480
seats on the council is doubled and each citizen now gets two votes,

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,440
not one. Here's how it works. At first election day for Kiwi is just the same

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,200
as before. He gets a list of candidates running to represent his local range on

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
the council. Kiwi picks one and the winner will be the

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
candidate with the most votes. So far the system is no better. Tuatara

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
again wins all the local elections and still more than half of the citizens

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
don't have any representation. But here's how Kiwi's second vote and

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
those extra seats on the council fix this.

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Kiwi uses his second vote to pick his favorite political party.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,680
These second votes are tallied up and show the percentage of support that each

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,480
of the political parties has among the citizens as a whole

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,520
and reveals how imbalanced the council is so far.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,040
To fix this imbalance members of the political parties are added one at a

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
time to make the council more proportional.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,880
Tuatara is the most overrepresented and Kia the most underrepresented

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,440
so Kia gets the first empty seat. This continues adding one Kia at a time

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,880
until both Tuatara and Kia are over represented and Kankapo is

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,520
underrepresented so they get the final seat.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
Now the jungle council represents as close as possible the actual preferences

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
of the citizens which is a huge improvement over the old

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,160
first-past-the-post method. There is however one interesting question that

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,520
should arise at this point. Exactly who decides which members of the

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,440
party get those extra seats? The way it works is that before the

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,560
election the political parties make a list of their favorite candidates in the

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
order they want them to get on the council.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,520
So if there's only one extra seat for their party the name at the top of their

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,560
list is chosen. If they get two extra seats the first two

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,840
are chosen and so on. This makes MMP a bit different from

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,880
other voting methods in that it makes political parties an official part of

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,480
the way the election works. This may give the party leaders greater

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
control over their members because they can reward or punish their actions by

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240
changing their placement on the party list.

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,680
While this may be a disadvantage of MMP there are a number of other benefits

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,080
that Queen Lion in particular likes. Because fewer votes are wasted it mostly

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,120
eliminates gerrymandering and prevents minority rule.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,840
It also gives more choice to the citizens by encouraging political

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
diversity. This point is worth expanding on. Notice

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
how with MMP the percentage of votes for the local

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
representatives isn't the same as for the parties.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
This is because in the local election citizens have to vote strategically.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760
For example kakapo voters don't like tuatara at all

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,000
but they can tolerate kia. Since there are so few kakapo voters they know that

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,880
their candidate doesn't have a chance of winning the local election

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,080
so it's really a race between the two big parties. Thus

67
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
many of the kakapo will vote kia in the hope that he might win and be their

68
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
representative. However when it comes to voting for

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
their favorite political party this strategy doesn't matter.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,480
The more votes a party gets the more representatives it has on the council

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
so citizens are free to vote for smaller parties they like knowing that every

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
vote counts. Queen Lion reviews her options and

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,120
decides to switch her kingdom to MMP. Now for the first time the jungle

74
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,960
council is a true reflection of what her citizens want.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
