00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is looking to improve her democracy.

00:03.520 --> 00:06.720
She recently allowed citizens to elect representatives to the Jungle Council,

00:06.720 --> 00:10.320
which governs the kingdom. However, she recognizes that her citizens

00:10.320 --> 00:13.760
are not happy with the voting system. Let's watch an election on one of the

00:13.760 --> 00:17.920
small islands of her kingdom to see why. On this island there are three political

00:17.920 --> 00:21.840
parties. The two big ones, Kia and Tuatara, and a small third party,

00:21.840 --> 00:24.880
Kakapo. On election day the citizens each cast

00:24.880 --> 00:28.480
one vote for a local candidate they want to represent the range they live in.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.920
The results are as follows, with the average across the island that Tuatara

00:31.920 --> 00:36.400
gets 49%, Kia gets 48%, and Kakapo gets 3%.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.760
The election is run using first past the post, meaning that the candidate with the

00:39.760 --> 00:43.040
most votes wins. Because Tuatara got the most votes in

00:43.040 --> 00:46.400
each range, they get to control 100% of the seats on the council.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.920
And this is why so many citizens are unhappy. The majority of them,

00:49.920 --> 00:54.800
the 51% who voted for other parties, get no representation on the council at all.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.760
This seems unfair to Queen Lion, but she's not sure how to fix it.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.560
The citizens like having local representatives and don't want to

01:00.560 --> 01:04.240
change the range boundaries. But luckily Kiwi, one of the citizens of

01:04.240 --> 01:07.440
this island, has a suggestion for Queen Lion on how she can make the system

01:07.440 --> 01:09.760
better while keeping local representation and

01:09.760 --> 01:12.720
leaving the ranges as they are. The idea is called Mixed Member

01:12.720 --> 01:17.040
Proportional, or MMP, and it makes two changes. The number of

01:17.040 --> 01:20.480
seats on the council is doubled and each citizen now gets two votes,

01:20.480 --> 01:25.440
not one. Here's how it works. At first election day for Kiwi is just the same

01:25.440 --> 01:29.200
as before. He gets a list of candidates running to represent his local range on

01:29.200 --> 01:31.680
the council. Kiwi picks one and the winner will be the

01:31.680 --> 01:36.000
candidate with the most votes. So far the system is no better. Tuatara

01:36.000 --> 01:39.040
again wins all the local elections and still more than half of the citizens

01:39.040 --> 01:42.640
don't have any representation. But here's how Kiwi's second vote and

01:42.640 --> 01:44.960
those extra seats on the council fix this.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.400
Kiwi uses his second vote to pick his favorite political party.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.680
These second votes are tallied up and show the percentage of support that each

01:51.680 --> 01:54.480
of the political parties has among the citizens as a whole

01:54.480 --> 01:57.520
and reveals how imbalanced the council is so far.

01:57.520 --> 02:01.040
To fix this imbalance members of the political parties are added one at a

02:01.040 --> 02:03.280
time to make the council more proportional.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.880
Tuatara is the most overrepresented and Kia the most underrepresented

02:06.880 --> 02:11.440
so Kia gets the first empty seat. This continues adding one Kia at a time

02:11.440 --> 02:14.880
until both Tuatara and Kia are over represented and Kankapo is

02:14.880 --> 02:17.520
underrepresented so they get the final seat.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.200
Now the jungle council represents as close as possible the actual preferences

02:21.200 --> 02:24.000
of the citizens which is a huge improvement over the old

02:24.000 --> 02:28.160
first-past-the-post method. There is however one interesting question that

02:28.160 --> 02:31.520
should arise at this point. Exactly who decides which members of the

02:31.520 --> 02:35.440
party get those extra seats? The way it works is that before the

02:35.440 --> 02:38.560
election the political parties make a list of their favorite candidates in the

02:38.560 --> 02:40.560
order they want them to get on the council.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.520
So if there's only one extra seat for their party the name at the top of their

02:43.520 --> 02:46.560
list is chosen. If they get two extra seats the first two

02:46.560 --> 02:49.840
are chosen and so on. This makes MMP a bit different from

02:49.840 --> 02:52.880
other voting methods in that it makes political parties an official part of

02:52.880 --> 02:56.480
the way the election works. This may give the party leaders greater

02:56.480 --> 02:59.840
control over their members because they can reward or punish their actions by

02:59.840 --> 03:02.240
changing their placement on the party list.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.680
While this may be a disadvantage of MMP there are a number of other benefits

03:05.680 --> 03:10.080
that Queen Lion in particular likes. Because fewer votes are wasted it mostly

03:10.080 --> 03:13.120
eliminates gerrymandering and prevents minority rule.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.840
It also gives more choice to the citizens by encouraging political

03:15.840 --> 03:19.280
diversity. This point is worth expanding on. Notice

03:19.280 --> 03:21.760
how with MMP the percentage of votes for the local

03:21.760 --> 03:24.560
representatives isn't the same as for the parties.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.400
This is because in the local election citizens have to vote strategically.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.760
For example kakapo voters don't like tuatara at all

03:31.760 --> 03:36.000
but they can tolerate kia. Since there are so few kakapo voters they know that

03:36.000 --> 03:38.880
their candidate doesn't have a chance of winning the local election

03:38.880 --> 03:42.080
so it's really a race between the two big parties. Thus

03:42.080 --> 03:45.440
many of the kakapo will vote kia in the hope that he might win and be their

03:45.440 --> 03:48.480
representative. However when it comes to voting for

03:48.480 --> 03:51.040
their favorite political party this strategy doesn't matter.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.480
The more votes a party gets the more representatives it has on the council

03:54.480 --> 03:57.840
so citizens are free to vote for smaller parties they like knowing that every

03:57.840 --> 04:01.040
vote counts. Queen Lion reviews her options and

04:01.040 --> 04:05.120
decides to switch her kingdom to MMP. Now for the first time the jungle

04:05.120 --> 04:08.960
council is a true reflection of what her citizens want.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.120
