0	3520	Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is looking to improve her democracy.
3520	6720	She recently allowed citizens to elect representatives to the Jungle Council,
6720	10320	which governs the kingdom. However, she recognizes that her citizens
10320	13760	are not happy with the voting system. Let's watch an election on one of the
13760	17920	small islands of her kingdom to see why. On this island there are three political
17920	21840	parties. The two big ones, Kia and Tuatara, and a small third party,
21840	24880	Kakapo. On election day the citizens each cast
24880	28480	one vote for a local candidate they want to represent the range they live in.
28480	31920	The results are as follows, with the average across the island that Tuatara
31920	36400	gets 49%, Kia gets 48%, and Kakapo gets 3%.
36400	39760	The election is run using first past the post, meaning that the candidate with the
39760	43040	most votes wins. Because Tuatara got the most votes in
43040	46400	each range, they get to control 100% of the seats on the council.
46400	49920	And this is why so many citizens are unhappy. The majority of them,
49920	54800	the 51% who voted for other parties, get no representation on the council at all.
54800	57760	This seems unfair to Queen Lion, but she's not sure how to fix it.
57760	60560	The citizens like having local representatives and don't want to
60560	64240	change the range boundaries. But luckily Kiwi, one of the citizens of
64240	67440	this island, has a suggestion for Queen Lion on how she can make the system
67440	69760	better while keeping local representation and
69760	72720	leaving the ranges as they are. The idea is called Mixed Member
72720	77040	Proportional, or MMP, and it makes two changes. The number of
77040	80480	seats on the council is doubled and each citizen now gets two votes,
80480	85440	not one. Here's how it works. At first election day for Kiwi is just the same
85440	89200	as before. He gets a list of candidates running to represent his local range on
89200	91680	the council. Kiwi picks one and the winner will be the
91680	96000	candidate with the most votes. So far the system is no better. Tuatara
96000	99040	again wins all the local elections and still more than half of the citizens
99040	102640	don't have any representation. But here's how Kiwi's second vote and
102640	104960	those extra seats on the council fix this.
104960	108400	Kiwi uses his second vote to pick his favorite political party.
108400	111680	These second votes are tallied up and show the percentage of support that each
111680	114480	of the political parties has among the citizens as a whole
114480	117520	and reveals how imbalanced the council is so far.
117520	121040	To fix this imbalance members of the political parties are added one at a
121040	123280	time to make the council more proportional.
123280	126880	Tuatara is the most overrepresented and Kia the most underrepresented
126880	131440	so Kia gets the first empty seat. This continues adding one Kia at a time
131440	134880	until both Tuatara and Kia are over represented and Kankapo is
134880	137520	underrepresented so they get the final seat.
137520	141200	Now the jungle council represents as close as possible the actual preferences
141200	144000	of the citizens which is a huge improvement over the old
144000	148160	first-past-the-post method. There is however one interesting question that
148160	151520	should arise at this point. Exactly who decides which members of the
151520	155440	party get those extra seats? The way it works is that before the
155440	158560	election the political parties make a list of their favorite candidates in the
158560	160560	order they want them to get on the council.
160560	163520	So if there's only one extra seat for their party the name at the top of their
163520	166560	list is chosen. If they get two extra seats the first two
166560	169840	are chosen and so on. This makes MMP a bit different from
169840	172880	other voting methods in that it makes political parties an official part of
172880	176480	the way the election works. This may give the party leaders greater
176480	179840	control over their members because they can reward or punish their actions by
179840	182240	changing their placement on the party list.
182240	185680	While this may be a disadvantage of MMP there are a number of other benefits
185680	190080	that Queen Lion in particular likes. Because fewer votes are wasted it mostly
190080	193120	eliminates gerrymandering and prevents minority rule.
193120	195840	It also gives more choice to the citizens by encouraging political
195840	199280	diversity. This point is worth expanding on. Notice
199280	201760	how with MMP the percentage of votes for the local
201760	204560	representatives isn't the same as for the parties.
204560	208400	This is because in the local election citizens have to vote strategically.
208400	211760	For example kakapo voters don't like tuatara at all
211760	216000	but they can tolerate kia. Since there are so few kakapo voters they know that
216000	218880	their candidate doesn't have a chance of winning the local election
218880	222080	so it's really a race between the two big parties. Thus
222080	225440	many of the kakapo will vote kia in the hope that he might win and be their
225440	228480	representative. However when it comes to voting for
228480	231040	their favorite political party this strategy doesn't matter.
231040	234480	The more votes a party gets the more representatives it has on the council
234480	237840	so citizens are free to vote for smaller parties they like knowing that every
237840	241040	vote counts. Queen Lion reviews her options and
241040	245120	decides to switch her kingdom to MMP. Now for the first time the jungle
245120	248960	council is a true reflection of what her citizens want.
