00:00.000 --> 00:04.300
This is the Tikoy test range, or at least it once was.

00:04.300 --> 00:08.960
The site is long abandoned now, but it once served a vital purpose.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.220
A military purpose.

00:10.220 --> 00:14.860
And the work done at Tikoy is still out in the world today.

00:14.860 --> 00:20.120
Constructed during the Cold War, at the entrance to the facility is a warning sign in Russian.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.620
But this is not the former Soviet Union.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.300
This is the great state of Utah, where, in Skull Valley, Tikoy resides.

00:27.300 --> 00:32.260
Much of what happened on site was classified, and equipment and documents were removed.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.100
But what remains is enough to piece together the story of Tikoy.

00:36.100 --> 00:40.220
The paperwork left behind bears the logo of Hercules Incorporated.

00:40.220 --> 00:47.020
Hercules got its start in the late 1800s, with a patent improving on dynamite to the creator named Hercules Powder,

00:47.020 --> 00:51.560
and began manufacturing the new explosive just outside of San Francisco,

00:51.560 --> 00:55.980
in a company town that would outlive the company, Hercules, California.

00:55.980 --> 00:59.260
Chemical manufacturing at the turn of the century was dangerous,

00:59.260 --> 01:03.560
and about 60 people would die in several explosions over the years.

01:03.560 --> 01:12.220
Hercules made many chemical products, but their smokeless gunpowder rapidly grew them to become a vital United States military supplier during the World Wars.

01:12.220 --> 01:16.420
As the posters said, Hercules' men and women in the war keep them shooting.

01:16.420 --> 01:23.460
The Cold War came next and brought with it a new weapon, the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, tipped with a nuclear warhead.

01:23.460 --> 01:30.300
Now, one country could destroy another remotely, and the only defense was a credible threat of retaliation.

01:30.300 --> 01:37.060
This drew the United States and the Soviet Union into an arms race, building more and better nuclear weapons each year.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.380
Technological development led to solid-fuel rocket motors.

01:40.380 --> 01:45.060
Unlike earlier liquid-based missiles, which had to be launched out in the open and were slow to fuel,

01:45.060 --> 01:47.580
the new motors allowed nuclear missiles to be hidden.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.860
America's cornfields would grow to contain 1,000 underground silos,

01:51.860 --> 01:55.180
each ready with a fast-launching Minuteman missile inside.

01:55.180 --> 01:59.740
But ground silos are in fixed locations and, once discovered, cannot be moved.

01:59.740 --> 02:03.140
Nuclear bombers are mobile, but planes can be found by radar.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.860
However, submarines can hide in the sea, difficult to find.

02:06.860 --> 02:14.580
So the United States developed the Ohio-class submarine, the largest yet built, for carrying a new solid-fuel Trident nuclear missile.

02:14.580 --> 02:20.460
The United States ordered 24 Ohios to be built, each with a maximum complement of 24 Tridents.

02:20.460 --> 02:27.580
Each Trident carried up to 14 warheads, a combined maximum delivery potential of more than 8,000 nuclear bombs.

02:27.580 --> 02:33.260
Thus, were the United States and her Minutemen to be destroyed in a first strike and all her aircraft shot down,

02:33.260 --> 02:39.260
there would still be more than enough Tridents launching from the hidden deep to safely assure mutual destruction.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.980
Which brings us back to Hercules and T-Coy.

02:41.980 --> 02:45.500
For, as the bullet in a round needs powder to hit a target,

02:45.500 --> 02:50.380
so too does the nuclear warhead in a Trident missile need its solid-fuel motor.

02:50.380 --> 02:56.980
Hercules manufactured the motors at a plant called Bacchus West in Magna, Utah, and brought them to T-Coy for testing.

02:56.980 --> 03:00.380
The large concrete cubes still here are thrust blocks.

03:00.380 --> 03:05.340
Their purpose to be an immovable object for a missile motor to push against during test firing.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.020
Each motor needed to be individually calibrated.

03:08.020 --> 03:13.020
Hitting a target a quarter of the world away while traveling at Mach 20 is a precise affair.

03:13.020 --> 03:18.980
So, once in place against the thrust block, technicians would connect sensors to the motor to measure heat and pressure.

03:18.980 --> 03:22.660
And those sensors connected via underground cables to instrument bunkers,

03:22.660 --> 03:27.820
where engineers would record the results with state-of-the-art 1970s computer assistants.

03:27.820 --> 03:30.260
Setup for each test could take a week or more.

03:30.260 --> 03:34.860
So, the motor and engineers and equipment had to be protected from the elements.

03:34.860 --> 03:40.860
But a missile can't be fired inside a building without melting the structure around it and invalidating the test.

03:40.860 --> 03:46.460
To solve this, the buildings at T-Coy were constructed on rails so they could be pulled back before firing

03:46.460 --> 03:51.100
and also give the nearby camera houses a clear view of the test.

04:08.100 --> 04:14.100
Hercules did improve on safety since its start in California a hundred years earlier.

04:14.100 --> 04:21.700
The large poles around each test site are lightning rods to divert strikes from the area's numerous storms and to prevent explosions.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.700
Nonetheless, one man was killed at T-Coy.

04:24.700 --> 04:29.900
In 1984, crushed beneath a motor that came loose during securement to the test block.

04:29.900 --> 04:36.700
An accident for which the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Hercules $640.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.300
The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules.

04:40.300 --> 04:45.500
The United States had been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them.

04:45.500 --> 04:51.500
T-Coy was used less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up,

04:51.500 --> 04:54.500
leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.700
Though the United States no longer needed the facility for strategic production,

04:58.700 --> 05:02.700
it was still strategically useful in a different wayâ€”politics.

05:02.700 --> 05:08.300
In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed START, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,

05:08.300 --> 05:11.900
where both agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles.

05:11.900 --> 05:16.100
Because, of course, neither country was just going to take the word of the other,

05:16.100 --> 05:19.300
numerous trust-but-verify policies were put into place.

05:19.300 --> 05:25.300
For example, both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the other's satellites to see.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.100
And each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.500
The United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets,

05:32.500 --> 05:37.900
one of which was the T-Coy test range and is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.500
Temporary housing for the inspection team was built in the Soviet Union

05:41.500 --> 05:46.100
to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls or tampered with the equipment

05:46.100 --> 05:50.100
and transported to Utah, forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.700
The flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved

05:53.700 --> 05:56.500
and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.100
T-Coy limped on during the inspection period.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.300
But in 1995, with too many cancelled contracts,

06:02.300 --> 06:05.700
the now-failing Hercules Incorporated put itself up for sale,

06:05.700 --> 06:11.700
acquired by Alliant Tech Systems, an American aerospace defense and sporting goods company.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.700
In 1999, the lease on this land expired.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.900
Alliant Tech Systems did not renew,

06:16.900 --> 06:21.500
and control of the T-Coy test range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation,

06:21.500 --> 06:23.900
within the borders of which T-Coy sits.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.900
Though T-Coy operates no more, its work lives on.

06:26.900 --> 06:31.500
220 Trident nuclear missiles are still actively deployed,

06:31.500 --> 06:38.300
waiting with their solid-fuel motors, calibrated here at T-Coy, to assure mutual destruction.
