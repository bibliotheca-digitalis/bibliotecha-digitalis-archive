0	4300	This is the Tikoy test range, or at least it once was.
4300	8960	The site is long abandoned now, but it once served a vital purpose.
8960	10220	A military purpose.
10220	14860	And the work done at Tikoy is still out in the world today.
14860	20120	Constructed during the Cold War, at the entrance to the facility is a warning sign in Russian.
20120	22620	But this is not the former Soviet Union.
22620	27300	This is the great state of Utah, where, in Skull Valley, Tikoy resides.
27300	32260	Much of what happened on site was classified, and equipment and documents were removed.
32260	36100	But what remains is enough to piece together the story of Tikoy.
36100	40220	The paperwork left behind bears the logo of Hercules Incorporated.
40220	47020	Hercules got its start in the late 1800s, with a patent improving on dynamite to the creator named Hercules Powder,
47020	51560	and began manufacturing the new explosive just outside of San Francisco,
51560	55980	in a company town that would outlive the company, Hercules, California.
55980	59260	Chemical manufacturing at the turn of the century was dangerous,
59260	63560	and about 60 people would die in several explosions over the years.
63560	72220	Hercules made many chemical products, but their smokeless gunpowder rapidly grew them to become a vital United States military supplier during the World Wars.
72220	76420	As the posters said, Hercules' men and women in the war keep them shooting.
76420	83460	The Cold War came next and brought with it a new weapon, the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, tipped with a nuclear warhead.
83460	90300	Now, one country could destroy another remotely, and the only defense was a credible threat of retaliation.
90300	97060	This drew the United States and the Soviet Union into an arms race, building more and better nuclear weapons each year.
97060	100380	Technological development led to solid-fuel rocket motors.
100380	105060	Unlike earlier liquid-based missiles, which had to be launched out in the open and were slow to fuel,
105060	107580	the new motors allowed nuclear missiles to be hidden.
107580	111860	America's cornfields would grow to contain 1,000 underground silos,
111860	115180	each ready with a fast-launching Minuteman missile inside.
115180	119740	But ground silos are in fixed locations and, once discovered, cannot be moved.
119740	123140	Nuclear bombers are mobile, but planes can be found by radar.
123140	126860	However, submarines can hide in the sea, difficult to find.
126860	134580	So the United States developed the Ohio-class submarine, the largest yet built, for carrying a new solid-fuel Trident nuclear missile.
134580	140460	The United States ordered 24 Ohios to be built, each with a maximum complement of 24 Tridents.
140460	147580	Each Trident carried up to 14 warheads, a combined maximum delivery potential of more than 8,000 nuclear bombs.
147580	153260	Thus, were the United States and her Minutemen to be destroyed in a first strike and all her aircraft shot down,
153260	159260	there would still be more than enough Tridents launching from the hidden deep to safely assure mutual destruction.
159260	161980	Which brings us back to Hercules and T-Coy.
161980	165500	For, as the bullet in a round needs powder to hit a target,
165500	170380	so too does the nuclear warhead in a Trident missile need its solid-fuel motor.
170380	176980	Hercules manufactured the motors at a plant called Bacchus West in Magna, Utah, and brought them to T-Coy for testing.
176980	180380	The large concrete cubes still here are thrust blocks.
180380	185340	Their purpose to be an immovable object for a missile motor to push against during test firing.
185340	188020	Each motor needed to be individually calibrated.
188020	193020	Hitting a target a quarter of the world away while traveling at Mach 20 is a precise affair.
193020	198980	So, once in place against the thrust block, technicians would connect sensors to the motor to measure heat and pressure.
198980	202660	And those sensors connected via underground cables to instrument bunkers,
202660	207820	where engineers would record the results with state-of-the-art 1970s computer assistants.
207820	210260	Setup for each test could take a week or more.
210260	214860	So, the motor and engineers and equipment had to be protected from the elements.
214860	220860	But a missile can't be fired inside a building without melting the structure around it and invalidating the test.
220860	226460	To solve this, the buildings at T-Coy were constructed on rails so they could be pulled back before firing
226460	231100	and also give the nearby camera houses a clear view of the test.
248100	254100	Hercules did improve on safety since its start in California a hundred years earlier.
254100	261700	The large poles around each test site are lightning rods to divert strikes from the area's numerous storms and to prevent explosions.
261700	264700	Nonetheless, one man was killed at T-Coy.
264700	269900	In 1984, crushed beneath a motor that came loose during securement to the test block.
269900	276700	An accident for which the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Hercules $640.
276700	280300	The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules.
280300	285500	The United States had been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them.
285500	291500	T-Coy was used less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up,
291500	294500	leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s.
294500	298700	Though the United States no longer needed the facility for strategic production,
298700	302700	it was still strategically useful in a different wayâ€”politics.
302700	308300	In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed START, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
308300	311900	where both agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles.
311900	316100	Because, of course, neither country was just going to take the word of the other,
316100	319300	numerous trust-but-verify policies were put into place.
319300	325300	For example, both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the other's satellites to see.
325300	329100	And each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect.
329100	332500	The United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets,
332500	337900	one of which was the T-Coy test range and is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance.
337900	341500	Temporary housing for the inspection team was built in the Soviet Union
341500	346100	to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls or tampered with the equipment
346100	350100	and transported to Utah, forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna.
350100	353700	The flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved
353700	356500	and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation.
356500	359100	T-Coy limped on during the inspection period.
359100	362300	But in 1995, with too many cancelled contracts,
362300	365700	the now-failing Hercules Incorporated put itself up for sale,
365700	371700	acquired by Alliant Tech Systems, an American aerospace defense and sporting goods company.
371700	374700	In 1999, the lease on this land expired.
374700	376900	Alliant Tech Systems did not renew,
376900	381500	and control of the T-Coy test range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation,
381500	383900	within the borders of which T-Coy sits.
383900	386900	Though T-Coy operates no more, its work lives on.
386900	391500	220 Trident nuclear missiles are still actively deployed,
391500	398300	waiting with their solid-fuel motors, calibrated here at T-Coy, to assure mutual destruction.
