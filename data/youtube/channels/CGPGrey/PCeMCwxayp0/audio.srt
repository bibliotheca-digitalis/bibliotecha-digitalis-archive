1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
This is the Tikoy test range, or at least it once was.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,960
The site is long abandoned now, but it once served a vital purpose.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,220
A military purpose.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,860
And the work done at Tikoy is still out in the world today.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,120
Constructed during the Cold War, at the entrance to the facility is a warning sign in Russian.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,620
But this is not the former Soviet Union.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,300
This is the great state of Utah, where, in Skull Valley, Tikoy resides.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,260
Much of what happened on site was classified, and equipment and documents were removed.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,100
But what remains is enough to piece together the story of Tikoy.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,220
The paperwork left behind bears the logo of Hercules Incorporated.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,020
Hercules got its start in the late 1800s, with a patent improving on dynamite to the creator named Hercules Powder,

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,560
and began manufacturing the new explosive just outside of San Francisco,

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,980
in a company town that would outlive the company, Hercules, California.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,260
Chemical manufacturing at the turn of the century was dangerous,

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,560
and about 60 people would die in several explosions over the years.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:12,220
Hercules made many chemical products, but their smokeless gunpowder rapidly grew them to become a vital United States military supplier during the World Wars.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,420
As the posters said, Hercules' men and women in the war keep them shooting.

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:23,460
The Cold War came next and brought with it a new weapon, the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, tipped with a nuclear warhead.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,300
Now, one country could destroy another remotely, and the only defense was a credible threat of retaliation.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:37,060
This drew the United States and the Soviet Union into an arms race, building more and better nuclear weapons each year.

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,380
Technological development led to solid-fuel rocket motors.

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,060
Unlike earlier liquid-based missiles, which had to be launched out in the open and were slow to fuel,

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,580
the new motors allowed nuclear missiles to be hidden.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,860
America's cornfields would grow to contain 1,000 underground silos,

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,180
each ready with a fast-launching Minuteman missile inside.

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,740
But ground silos are in fixed locations and, once discovered, cannot be moved.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,140
Nuclear bombers are mobile, but planes can be found by radar.

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,860
However, submarines can hide in the sea, difficult to find.

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:14,580
So the United States developed the Ohio-class submarine, the largest yet built, for carrying a new solid-fuel Trident nuclear missile.

30
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,460
The United States ordered 24 Ohios to be built, each with a maximum complement of 24 Tridents.

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,580
Each Trident carried up to 14 warheads, a combined maximum delivery potential of more than 8,000 nuclear bombs.

32
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,260
Thus, were the United States and her Minutemen to be destroyed in a first strike and all her aircraft shot down,

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:39,260
there would still be more than enough Tridents launching from the hidden deep to safely assure mutual destruction.

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,980
Which brings us back to Hercules and T-Coy.

35
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,500
For, as the bullet in a round needs powder to hit a target,

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,380
so too does the nuclear warhead in a Trident missile need its solid-fuel motor.

37
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,980
Hercules manufactured the motors at a plant called Bacchus West in Magna, Utah, and brought them to T-Coy for testing.

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,380
The large concrete cubes still here are thrust blocks.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,340
Their purpose to be an immovable object for a missile motor to push against during test firing.

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,020
Each motor needed to be individually calibrated.

41
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Hitting a target a quarter of the world away while traveling at Mach 20 is a precise affair.

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,980
So, once in place against the thrust block, technicians would connect sensors to the motor to measure heat and pressure.

43
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,660
And those sensors connected via underground cables to instrument bunkers,

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,820
where engineers would record the results with state-of-the-art 1970s computer assistants.

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,260
Setup for each test could take a week or more.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,860
So, the motor and engineers and equipment had to be protected from the elements.

47
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,860
But a missile can't be fired inside a building without melting the structure around it and invalidating the test.

48
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,460
To solve this, the buildings at T-Coy were constructed on rails so they could be pulled back before firing

49
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,100
and also give the nearby camera houses a clear view of the test.

50
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Hercules did improve on safety since its start in California a hundred years earlier.

51
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,700
The large poles around each test site are lightning rods to divert strikes from the area's numerous storms and to prevent explosions.

52
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Nonetheless, one man was killed at T-Coy.

53
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,900
In 1984, crushed beneath a motor that came loose during securement to the test block.

54
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,700
An accident for which the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Hercules $640.

55
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,300
The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules.

56
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,500
The United States had been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them.

57
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,500
T-Coy was used less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up,

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,700
Though the United States no longer needed the facility for strategic production,

60
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,700
it was still strategically useful in a different wayâ€”politics.

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,300
In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed START, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,

62
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,900
where both agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles.

63
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,100
Because, of course, neither country was just going to take the word of the other,

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,300
numerous trust-but-verify policies were put into place.

65
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,300
For example, both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the other's satellites to see.

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,100
And each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect.

67
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,500
The United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets,

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,900
one of which was the T-Coy test range and is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance.

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,500
Temporary housing for the inspection team was built in the Soviet Union

70
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,100
to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls or tampered with the equipment

71
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,100
and transported to Utah, forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna.

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,700
The flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved

73
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,500
and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation.

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,100
T-Coy limped on during the inspection period.

75
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,300
But in 1995, with too many cancelled contracts,

76
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,700
the now-failing Hercules Incorporated put itself up for sale,

77
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,700
acquired by Alliant Tech Systems, an American aerospace defense and sporting goods company.

78
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,700
In 1999, the lease on this land expired.

79
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,900
Alliant Tech Systems did not renew,

80
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,500
and control of the T-Coy test range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation,

81
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
within the borders of which T-Coy sits.

82
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Though T-Coy operates no more, its work lives on.

83
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,500
220 Trident nuclear missiles are still actively deployed,

84
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,300
waiting with their solid-fuel motors, calibrated here at T-Coy, to assure mutual destruction.
