1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Tiffany is a very neon 80s name, and not without reason.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,120
It exploded in popularity during the decade,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,120
but despite Tiffany's modern sound, the name wasn't born in the 80s.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,840
Tiffany is at least 80 decades old.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,480
OMG, that's like, positively medieval.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,280
How is that, and then why is this?

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,480
Well, let me tell you the tale of tracking Tiffany through time.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,280
It starts in the year 300, with this guy,

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,240
Asibius, a historian and bishop in the Holy Land.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
He wrote a treatise on the divine manifestation,

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,280
and the word for that in the Greek he wrote was Theophania.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,240
In ye olden days, religious virtue names were totally a thing,

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,320
and Theophania became a name given to children born on the Feast of the Epiphany,

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
though no five-syllable name can go un-nicked,

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,240
so for some rhyming sage, a Tiffany epiphany was inevitable.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,360
The name, thus born in the Holy Land, then spread with the Greek language.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,160
The most famous example appears in 972,

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire,

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
whose name is written this way,

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
and probably pronounced Teofanu.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
Ancient pronunciation is a whole other thing

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
that we are going to skip because it's unknowable,

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,200
and it doesn't help that the Empress's name is listed in different ways,

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
so it's impossible to know if she went by Teofanu,

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,800
or Theophania, or Theophania,

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,920
which are all close to Tiffany, but not quite.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,480
Who knows?

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,800
Maybe she shortened it and her title was Tith,

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
Empress of the Empire.

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,960
The top Tith.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,400
But that's just speculation.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,160
When this word first became a Tiffany name precursor isn't exactly known.

33
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,080
Spoiler for history, pre-printing press,

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
there's not a lot of written evidence for anything,

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,440
and lots of documents that did exist got lost.

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
So to tell the totality of the tale

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,160
takes trusses of trust betwixt the islands of evidence.

38
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,440
It's time to try to find the true old-time Tifs

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,600
by working backwards through hundreds of years of census books.

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
And if you did that in English, you wouldn't find much.

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
Thanks for nothing, Doomsday Book.

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,280
But if you also looked in French,

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,800
you could find Tiffany Ragonelle, born 1335,

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,520
about whom all information is delightful.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,280
A noble lady astrologer,

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
who lived in France's fairytale castle Mont Saint-Michel,

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
and who used her astrological powers

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
to predict the outcome of her husband's knighting battles.

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
Hey honey, maybe don't go on that one?

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
And she was righter than wronger,

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,880
because he survived to ascend to become the Grand Constable of France,

52
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,320
First Officer of the Crown.

53
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,280
On the island, there's still a little museum to her and her husband.

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
The one thing you won't find in that museum is her skull,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
which turned up just a few years ago in a relinkery box in the town of Dinan,

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
with a note on it saying this is the skull of Tiffany Ragonelle,

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,480
and given anonymously to the local library.

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
So that's a thing that happened.

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
Wait, why are we talking about this?

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
Oh right, because this is the oldest Tiffany that's pretty much spelled Tiffany,

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
and about whom details of her life are known.

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
But were you to keep going backwards through the census books,

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
you'd also strike a trio of Tiffany's in Paris in 1313.

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
But all that is known about them is their list of professions.

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
Waxmaker, washerwoman, and spinster.

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
A woman who spins spool into thread.

67
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,040
Thus, this foursome of French Tiffany's written records

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
are the proof that Tiffany is totally neon medieval.

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,520
Though you might be wondering exactly how did a Greek name from here

70
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
end up on a fancy French Tiffany over here.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,040
Me too.

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,160
So if you kept looking through every old document

73
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,360
that might be a list of names for hundreds of hours,

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
if you were lucky you would eventually stumble on the transcripts of charters

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
related to Gilbertine houses from 1161,

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,640
containing a single Tiffany,

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,960
well, Tiffany with an eph, but that's close enough to count,

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,720
who lived in Fortherby, England.

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
How did she get there?

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Well, we must cross another truss of trust,

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,400
but Tiffany had a grandfather named Hugh,

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
who was at just the right time and place

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,800
to travel to the Holy Land in the First Crusade.

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,520
And going through the surviving records of Crusaders from the time,

85
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,120
there are candidate Hughes.

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,960
And while I can't prove the Tiffany-Hugh connection 100%,

87
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
which kills me,

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm still calling it that Grandpa Hugh on his travels

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
came across an epiphany Tiffany

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,080
and brought the name back to middle England and the English language,

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
as also did French Crusaders to France.

92
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
It all fits.

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
But it does leave the question,

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,320
if Tiffany in its modern form is near a millennia old,

95
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
why don't we think of it that way?

96
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,160
Probably just historical happenstance,

97
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,760
a lack of fame as Tiffany's.

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,960
There were no queens born on the epiphany to be named Tiffany,

99
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,440
leaving Teofanu as the most prominent Tiffany,

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,200
except not exactly a Tiffany,

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
and Tiffany Ragonelle isn't particularly famous,

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,520
until hopefully now that is.

103
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,760
If you go on your own French Tiffany Crusade,

104
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
be sure to tell them Grey sent you.

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,800
So, aside from these two,

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,400
the name never landed on fame to pop in popularity like it would later,

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
just sporadically showing up in written records in the late 1700s and 1800s.

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
Which, as an alternate history side note,

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,640
it does mean that at the time Jane Austen was writing Emma,

110
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,560
the name Tiffany was infrequently around with its exact modern spelling.

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,240
So if the authoress was looking for an underused name with literary potential,

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,200
she could have picked Tiffany

113
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,840
and turned the Georgian and Victorian eras neon as well.

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,120
And I mean, come on,

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
the name Tiffany Woodhouse is totes perfect for the character.

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
But sadly, it didn't happen,

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
and Tiffany remained a name without fame.

118
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,880
She would get there,

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
but jumping backwards,

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
she first needed to transform.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
In 1629, Tiffany does appear on an English census,

122
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,400
finally,

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
this time for the first time,

124
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,680
as a last name,

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
with one Mr. Henry Tiffany,

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
who lived and died in Hackney, London.

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Okay, so he wasn't born a Tiffany?

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
Were you to track down his christening,

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
you'd find he was Henry Tiffin at the time,

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
but once grown up and married,

131
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,320
the record now shows him as the first of the family of Tiffany.

132
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,360
Why the name change?

133
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
It probably wasn't one.

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Consistent spelling in the English language

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
totally wasn't a thing back then.

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
None other than Tiffin Tiffany's contemporary,

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,440
William Shakespeare,

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
never spelled his signature the same way twice.

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,400
English was,

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,920
and still kind of is,

141
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,000
very whatever with the written word.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
So Henry Tiffin became Tiffany randomly,

143
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
and because the world is just too perfect sometimes,

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm also calling it that this Mr. Tiffany,

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,760
the first to appear with the last name in the English language,

146
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,080
is directly responsible for this explosion of Tiffany's 400 years later.

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
Come with me.

148
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
So Henry Tiffany had a son in 1630,

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,480
Humphrey Tiffany,

150
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,840
who moved to the shiny New England sometime before 1660.

151
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
Humphrey Tiffany took the name to America

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,040
and simultaneously removed it from England as a last name,

153
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,840
as he was Henry Tiffany's only surviving son,

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,360
who would also have a son,

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
James Tiffany in 1666.

156
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,080
From there,

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
James Tiffany Jr. 1697 to Ebeneezer Tiffany 1734

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,320
to Comfort Tiffany 1777 to 1812,

159
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Charles Lewis Tiffany,

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
which has caused some bulbs in the audience to light,

161
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
but to follow through,

162
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,600
Charles Lewis Tiffany with some friends

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,160
established a stationary and fancy goods emporium shop

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
named Tiffany, Young & Ellis in 1837.

165
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Charles Lewis Tiffany eventually took control of the company,

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,880
changed the name to Tiffany & Co. to focus on jewelry exclusively,

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
well, except for that period during the Civil War

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,280
when he switched to manufacturing swords as the Tiffany Experience,

169
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
but after that, back to jewelry.

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,160
From the late 1800s,

171
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,760
this New York City store for Tiffany was her most prominent placement

172
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,440
since the Empress or the Astrologer,

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,840
and it remained so until 1958,

174
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
when Truman Capote walked by,

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
the name caught the author's attention as underused with literary potential,

176
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
and he wrote and published the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.

177
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
Prior to this moment, Tiffany as a first name was holding on,

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,920
but barely, averaging under 10 babies a year.

179
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,240
After the novella, there's a slight uptick in the name,

180
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
but that could be a coincidence,

181
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
but what definitely isn't is in 1961,

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
the novella became a movie starring Audrey Hepburn,

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,320
and it would not be understatement to say

184
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,240
that this role turned her into a time-transcending Hollywood icon

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
forever connected with the name in the title.

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,320
Tiffany had found her fame,

187
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,520
and the following year, the Tiffany's quintupled,

188
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,240
setting a solid base for an exponential explosion,

189
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,040
and grew over the next 20 years as children grew,

190
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,200
having seen the movie to have children of their own,

191
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
bringing us to 1979,

192
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,320
and there are almost 10,000 Tiffany's a year.

193
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,960
Now, we are still on a truss of trust for this Tiffany theory.

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
Maybe it wasn't the store-turned-story-turned-movie.

195
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
It could have been a coincidence.

196
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
If you look at enough random events,

197
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
you can always draw some convincing correlations.

198
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,480
But remember that in ye olden days of the 60s and early 70s,

199
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,240
movies could only be seen in theaters,

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,200
but by the late 70s, there was a new invention,

201
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,440
VHS, the Video Home System,

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
so you could watch movies anytime in glorious 480 pixels.

203
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,880
And well, guess what?

204
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Breakfast at Tiffany's happens to be the first Audrey Hepburn movie

205
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,920
released on VHS in, wait for it, 1979.

206
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
And one year later,

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
total Tiffany's doubled,

208
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,400
rolling into the 80s torrent of Tiffany's,

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
where the name was top 20 for 9 out of 10 years,

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,960
the Tiffany ascendancy that had started with theophany in prehistory.

211
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,200
And that is the tale of Tiffany.

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,080
She's carried her neon torch through the ages,

213
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,880
and long may she carry it into the future.

214
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
To Tiffany.
