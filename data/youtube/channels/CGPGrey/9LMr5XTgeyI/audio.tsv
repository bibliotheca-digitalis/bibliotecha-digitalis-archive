0	4000	Tiffany is a very neon 80s name, and not without reason.
4000	7120	It exploded in popularity during the decade,
7120	11120	but despite Tiffany's modern sound, the name wasn't born in the 80s.
11120	13840	Tiffany is at least 80 decades old.
13840	16480	OMG, that's like, positively medieval.
16480	19280	How is that, and then why is this?
19280	22480	Well, let me tell you the tale of tracking Tiffany through time.
22480	25280	It starts in the year 300, with this guy,
25280	28240	Asibius, a historian and bishop in the Holy Land.
28240	30400	He wrote a treatise on the divine manifestation,
30400	33280	and the word for that in the Greek he wrote was Theophania.
33280	36240	In ye olden days, religious virtue names were totally a thing,
36240	40320	and Theophania became a name given to children born on the Feast of the Epiphany,
40320	42800	though no five-syllable name can go un-nicked,
42800	46240	so for some rhyming sage, a Tiffany epiphany was inevitable.
46240	49360	The name, thus born in the Holy Land, then spread with the Greek language.
49360	52160	The most famous example appears in 972,
52160	54160	with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire,
54160	55760	whose name is written this way,
55760	58160	and probably pronounced Teofanu.
58160	60320	Ancient pronunciation is a whole other thing
60320	62160	that we are going to skip because it's unknowable,
62160	65200	and it doesn't help that the Empress's name is listed in different ways,
65200	68400	so it's impossible to know if she went by Teofanu,
68400	70800	or Theophania, or Theophania,
70800	73920	which are all close to Tiffany, but not quite.
73920	74480	Who knows?
74480	76800	Maybe she shortened it and her title was Tith,
76800	78240	Empress of the Empire.
78240	78960	The top Tith.
78960	80400	But that's just speculation.
80400	84160	When this word first became a Tiffany name precursor isn't exactly known.
84160	86080	Spoiler for history, pre-printing press,
86080	88640	there's not a lot of written evidence for anything,
88640	91440	and lots of documents that did exist got lost.
91440	93360	So to tell the totality of the tale
93360	96160	takes trusses of trust betwixt the islands of evidence.
96160	99440	It's time to try to find the true old-time Tifs
99440	103600	by working backwards through hundreds of years of census books.
103600	105680	And if you did that in English, you wouldn't find much.
105680	106960	Thanks for nothing, Doomsday Book.
106960	109280	But if you also looked in French,
109280	112800	you could find Tiffany Ragonelle, born 1335,
112800	115520	about whom all information is delightful.
115520	117280	A noble lady astrologer,
117280	120000	who lived in France's fairytale castle Mont Saint-Michel,
120000	121680	and who used her astrological powers
121680	123920	to predict the outcome of her husband's knighting battles.
123920	125600	Hey honey, maybe don't go on that one?
125600	127280	And she was righter than wronger,
127280	130880	because he survived to ascend to become the Grand Constable of France,
130880	132320	First Officer of the Crown.
132320	135280	On the island, there's still a little museum to her and her husband.
135280	138000	The one thing you won't find in that museum is her skull,
138000	141120	which turned up just a few years ago in a relinkery box in the town of Dinan,
141120	144160	with a note on it saying this is the skull of Tiffany Ragonelle,
144160	146480	and given anonymously to the local library.
146480	147840	So that's a thing that happened.
147840	149520	Wait, why are we talking about this?
149520	153360	Oh right, because this is the oldest Tiffany that's pretty much spelled Tiffany,
153360	156080	and about whom details of her life are known.
156080	159120	But were you to keep going backwards through the census books,
159120	162480	you'd also strike a trio of Tiffany's in Paris in 1313.
162480	165040	But all that is known about them is their list of professions.
165040	166800	Waxmaker, washerwoman, and spinster.
166800	168320	A woman who spins spool into thread.
168320	171040	Thus, this foursome of French Tiffany's written records
171040	173920	are the proof that Tiffany is totally neon medieval.
173920	177520	Though you might be wondering exactly how did a Greek name from here
177520	180160	end up on a fancy French Tiffany over here.
180160	181040	Me too.
181040	184160	So if you kept looking through every old document
184160	187360	that might be a list of names for hundreds of hours,
187360	189920	if you were lucky you would eventually stumble on the transcripts of charters
189920	192800	related to Gilbertine houses from 1161,
192800	194640	containing a single Tiffany,
194640	196960	well, Tiffany with an eph, but that's close enough to count,
196960	198720	who lived in Fortherby, England.
198720	199840	How did she get there?
199840	202240	Well, we must cross another truss of trust,
202240	204400	but Tiffany had a grandfather named Hugh,
204400	206080	who was at just the right time and place
206080	208800	to travel to the Holy Land in the First Crusade.
208800	211520	And going through the surviving records of Crusaders from the time,
211520	213120	there are candidate Hughes.
213120	216960	And while I can't prove the Tiffany-Hugh connection 100%,
216960	218560	which kills me,
218560	221440	I'm still calling it that Grandpa Hugh on his travels
221440	223120	came across an epiphany Tiffany
223120	226080	and brought the name back to middle England and the English language,
226080	228240	as also did French Crusaders to France.
228240	229040	It all fits.
229040	231200	But it does leave the question,
231200	234320	if Tiffany in its modern form is near a millennia old,
234320	235920	why don't we think of it that way?
235920	238160	Probably just historical happenstance,
238160	239760	a lack of fame as Tiffany's.
239760	242960	There were no queens born on the epiphany to be named Tiffany,
242960	245440	leaving Teofanu as the most prominent Tiffany,
245440	247200	except not exactly a Tiffany,
247200	249920	and Tiffany Ragonelle isn't particularly famous,
249920	251520	until hopefully now that is.
251520	253760	If you go on your own French Tiffany Crusade,
253760	255680	be sure to tell them Grey sent you.
255680	256800	So, aside from these two,
256800	260400	the name never landed on fame to pop in popularity like it would later,
260400	264400	just sporadically showing up in written records in the late 1700s and 1800s.
264400	266160	Which, as an alternate history side note,
266160	268640	it does mean that at the time Jane Austen was writing Emma,
268640	272560	the name Tiffany was infrequently around with its exact modern spelling.
272560	276240	So if the authoress was looking for an underused name with literary potential,
276240	277200	she could have picked Tiffany
277200	279840	and turned the Georgian and Victorian eras neon as well.
279840	281120	And I mean, come on,
281120	284400	the name Tiffany Woodhouse is totes perfect for the character.
284400	285680	But sadly, it didn't happen,
285680	287840	and Tiffany remained a name without fame.
287840	288880	She would get there,
288880	290080	but jumping backwards,
290080	292000	she first needed to transform.
292000	295840	In 1629, Tiffany does appear on an English census,
295840	296400	finally,
296400	298320	this time for the first time,
298320	299680	as a last name,
299680	301680	with one Mr. Henry Tiffany,
301680	303680	who lived and died in Hackney, London.
303680	305680	Okay, so he wasn't born a Tiffany?
305680	307360	Were you to track down his christening,
307360	309440	you'd find he was Henry Tiffin at the time,
309440	311040	but once grown up and married,
311040	314320	the record now shows him as the first of the family of Tiffany.
314320	315360	Why the name change?
315360	316720	It probably wasn't one.
316720	318720	Consistent spelling in the English language
318720	320400	totally wasn't a thing back then.
320400	322560	None other than Tiffin Tiffany's contemporary,
322560	323440	William Shakespeare,
323440	325680	never spelled his signature the same way twice.
325680	326400	English was,
326400	327920	and still kind of is,
327920	330000	very whatever with the written word.
330000	332320	So Henry Tiffin became Tiffany randomly,
332320	334800	and because the world is just too perfect sometimes,
334800	337360	I'm also calling it that this Mr. Tiffany,
337360	339760	the first to appear with the last name in the English language,
339760	344080	is directly responsible for this explosion of Tiffany's 400 years later.
344080	344880	Come with me.
344880	347680	So Henry Tiffany had a son in 1630,
347680	348480	Humphrey Tiffany,
348480	351840	who moved to the shiny New England sometime before 1660.
351840	353600	Humphrey Tiffany took the name to America
353600	357040	and simultaneously removed it from England as a last name,
357040	359840	as he was Henry Tiffany's only surviving son,
359840	361360	who would also have a son,
361360	363520	James Tiffany in 1666.
363520	364080	From there,
364080	367600	James Tiffany Jr. 1697 to Ebeneezer Tiffany 1734
367600	370320	to Comfort Tiffany 1777 to 1812,
370320	371680	Charles Lewis Tiffany,
371680	374560	which has caused some bulbs in the audience to light,
374560	375760	but to follow through,
375760	377600	Charles Lewis Tiffany with some friends
377600	380160	established a stationary and fancy goods emporium shop
380160	383040	named Tiffany, Young & Ellis in 1837.
383040	385680	Charles Lewis Tiffany eventually took control of the company,
385680	388880	changed the name to Tiffany & Co. to focus on jewelry exclusively,
388880	390560	well, except for that period during the Civil War
390560	393280	when he switched to manufacturing swords as the Tiffany Experience,
393280	394960	but after that, back to jewelry.
394960	396160	From the late 1800s,
396160	399760	this New York City store for Tiffany was her most prominent placement
399760	401440	since the Empress or the Astrologer,
401440	403840	and it remained so until 1958,
403840	405360	when Truman Capote walked by,
405360	408720	the name caught the author's attention as underused with literary potential,
408720	411520	and he wrote and published the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.
411520	414800	Prior to this moment, Tiffany as a first name was holding on,
414800	417920	but barely, averaging under 10 babies a year.
417920	420240	After the novella, there's a slight uptick in the name,
420240	421840	but that could be a coincidence,
421840	424560	but what definitely isn't is in 1961,
424560	426880	the novella became a movie starring Audrey Hepburn,
426880	428320	and it would not be understatement to say
428320	432240	that this role turned her into a time-transcending Hollywood icon
432240	434560	forever connected with the name in the title.
434560	436320	Tiffany had found her fame,
436320	439520	and the following year, the Tiffany's quintupled,
439520	442240	setting a solid base for an exponential explosion,
442240	445040	and grew over the next 20 years as children grew,
445040	447200	having seen the movie to have children of their own,
447200	449200	bringing us to 1979,
449200	452320	and there are almost 10,000 Tiffany's a year.
452320	454960	Now, we are still on a truss of trust for this Tiffany theory.
454960	457520	Maybe it wasn't the store-turned-story-turned-movie.
457520	458960	It could have been a coincidence.
458960	460240	If you look at enough random events,
460240	462720	you can always draw some convincing correlations.
462720	466480	But remember that in ye olden days of the 60s and early 70s,
466480	468240	movies could only be seen in theaters,
468240	471200	but by the late 70s, there was a new invention,
471200	473440	VHS, the Video Home System,
473440	476800	so you could watch movies anytime in glorious 480 pixels.
476800	478880	And well, guess what?
478880	482880	Breakfast at Tiffany's happens to be the first Audrey Hepburn movie
482880	487920	released on VHS in, wait for it, 1979.
487920	490000	And one year later,
490000	491920	total Tiffany's doubled,
491920	494400	rolling into the 80s torrent of Tiffany's,
494400	498400	where the name was top 20 for 9 out of 10 years,
498400	502960	the Tiffany ascendancy that had started with theophany in prehistory.
502960	505200	And that is the tale of Tiffany.
505200	508080	She's carried her neon torch through the ages,
508080	510880	and long may she carry it into the future.
510880	512880	To Tiffany.
