00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Tiffany is a very neon 80s name, and not without reason.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.120
It exploded in popularity during the decade,

00:07.120 --> 00:11.120
but despite Tiffany's modern sound, the name wasn't born in the 80s.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.840
Tiffany is at least 80 decades old.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.480
OMG, that's like, positively medieval.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.280
How is that, and then why is this?

00:19.280 --> 00:22.480
Well, let me tell you the tale of tracking Tiffany through time.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.280
It starts in the year 300, with this guy,

00:25.280 --> 00:28.240
Asibius, a historian and bishop in the Holy Land.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.400
He wrote a treatise on the divine manifestation,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.280
and the word for that in the Greek he wrote was Theophania.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.240
In ye olden days, religious virtue names were totally a thing,

00:36.240 --> 00:40.320
and Theophania became a name given to children born on the Feast of the Epiphany,

00:40.320 --> 00:42.800
though no five-syllable name can go un-nicked,

00:42.800 --> 00:46.240
so for some rhyming sage, a Tiffany epiphany was inevitable.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.360
The name, thus born in the Holy Land, then spread with the Greek language.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.160
The most famous example appears in 972,

00:52.160 --> 00:54.160
with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire,

00:54.160 --> 00:55.760
whose name is written this way,

00:55.760 --> 00:58.160
and probably pronounced Teofanu.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.320
Ancient pronunciation is a whole other thing

01:00.320 --> 01:02.160
that we are going to skip because it's unknowable,

01:02.160 --> 01:05.200
and it doesn't help that the Empress's name is listed in different ways,

01:05.200 --> 01:08.400
so it's impossible to know if she went by Teofanu,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.800
or Theophania, or Theophania,

01:10.800 --> 01:13.920
which are all close to Tiffany, but not quite.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.480
Who knows?

01:14.480 --> 01:16.800
Maybe she shortened it and her title was Tith,

01:16.800 --> 01:18.240
Empress of the Empire.

01:18.240 --> 01:18.960
The top Tith.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.400
But that's just speculation.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.160
When this word first became a Tiffany name precursor isn't exactly known.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.080
Spoiler for history, pre-printing press,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.640
there's not a lot of written evidence for anything,

01:28.640 --> 01:31.440
and lots of documents that did exist got lost.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.360
So to tell the totality of the tale

01:33.360 --> 01:36.160
takes trusses of trust betwixt the islands of evidence.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.440
It's time to try to find the true old-time Tifs

01:39.440 --> 01:43.600
by working backwards through hundreds of years of census books.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.680
And if you did that in English, you wouldn't find much.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.960
Thanks for nothing, Doomsday Book.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.280
But if you also looked in French,

01:49.280 --> 01:52.800
you could find Tiffany Ragonelle, born 1335,

01:52.800 --> 01:55.520
about whom all information is delightful.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.280
A noble lady astrologer,

01:57.280 --> 02:00.000
who lived in France's fairytale castle Mont Saint-Michel,

02:00.000 --> 02:01.680
and who used her astrological powers

02:01.680 --> 02:03.920
to predict the outcome of her husband's knighting battles.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.600
Hey honey, maybe don't go on that one?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.280
And she was righter than wronger,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.880
because he survived to ascend to become the Grand Constable of France,

02:10.880 --> 02:12.320
First Officer of the Crown.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.280
On the island, there's still a little museum to her and her husband.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.000
The one thing you won't find in that museum is her skull,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.120
which turned up just a few years ago in a relinkery box in the town of Dinan,

02:21.120 --> 02:24.160
with a note on it saying this is the skull of Tiffany Ragonelle,

02:24.160 --> 02:26.480
and given anonymously to the local library.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.840
So that's a thing that happened.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.520
Wait, why are we talking about this?

02:29.520 --> 02:33.360
Oh right, because this is the oldest Tiffany that's pretty much spelled Tiffany,

02:33.360 --> 02:36.080
and about whom details of her life are known.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.120
But were you to keep going backwards through the census books,

02:39.120 --> 02:42.480
you'd also strike a trio of Tiffany's in Paris in 1313.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.040
But all that is known about them is their list of professions.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.800
Waxmaker, washerwoman, and spinster.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.320
A woman who spins spool into thread.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.040
Thus, this foursome of French Tiffany's written records

02:51.040 --> 02:53.920
are the proof that Tiffany is totally neon medieval.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.520
Though you might be wondering exactly how did a Greek name from here

02:57.520 --> 03:00.160
end up on a fancy French Tiffany over here.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.040
Me too.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.160
So if you kept looking through every old document

03:04.160 --> 03:07.360
that might be a list of names for hundreds of hours,

03:07.360 --> 03:09.920
if you were lucky you would eventually stumble on the transcripts of charters

03:09.920 --> 03:12.800
related to Gilbertine houses from 1161,

03:12.800 --> 03:14.640
containing a single Tiffany,

03:14.640 --> 03:16.960
well, Tiffany with an eph, but that's close enough to count,

03:16.960 --> 03:18.720
who lived in Fortherby, England.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.840
How did she get there?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.240
Well, we must cross another truss of trust,

03:22.240 --> 03:24.400
but Tiffany had a grandfather named Hugh,

03:24.400 --> 03:26.080
who was at just the right time and place

03:26.080 --> 03:28.800
to travel to the Holy Land in the First Crusade.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.520
And going through the surviving records of Crusaders from the time,

03:31.520 --> 03:33.120
there are candidate Hughes.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.960
And while I can't prove the Tiffany-Hugh connection 100%,

03:36.960 --> 03:38.560
which kills me,

03:38.560 --> 03:41.440
I'm still calling it that Grandpa Hugh on his travels

03:41.440 --> 03:43.120
came across an epiphany Tiffany

03:43.120 --> 03:46.080
and brought the name back to middle England and the English language,

03:46.080 --> 03:48.240
as also did French Crusaders to France.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.040
It all fits.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.200
But it does leave the question,

03:51.200 --> 03:54.320
if Tiffany in its modern form is near a millennia old,

03:54.320 --> 03:55.920
why don't we think of it that way?

03:55.920 --> 03:58.160
Probably just historical happenstance,

03:58.160 --> 03:59.760
a lack of fame as Tiffany's.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.960
There were no queens born on the epiphany to be named Tiffany,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.440
leaving Teofanu as the most prominent Tiffany,

04:05.440 --> 04:07.200
except not exactly a Tiffany,

04:07.200 --> 04:09.920
and Tiffany Ragonelle isn't particularly famous,

04:09.920 --> 04:11.520
until hopefully now that is.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.760
If you go on your own French Tiffany Crusade,

04:13.760 --> 04:15.680
be sure to tell them Grey sent you.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.800
So, aside from these two,

04:16.800 --> 04:20.400
the name never landed on fame to pop in popularity like it would later,

04:20.400 --> 04:24.400
just sporadically showing up in written records in the late 1700s and 1800s.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.160
Which, as an alternate history side note,

04:26.160 --> 04:28.640
it does mean that at the time Jane Austen was writing Emma,

04:28.640 --> 04:32.560
the name Tiffany was infrequently around with its exact modern spelling.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.240
So if the authoress was looking for an underused name with literary potential,

04:36.240 --> 04:37.200
she could have picked Tiffany

04:37.200 --> 04:39.840
and turned the Georgian and Victorian eras neon as well.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.120
And I mean, come on,

04:41.120 --> 04:44.400
the name Tiffany Woodhouse is totes perfect for the character.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.680
But sadly, it didn't happen,

04:45.680 --> 04:47.840
and Tiffany remained a name without fame.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.880
She would get there,

04:48.880 --> 04:50.080
but jumping backwards,

04:50.080 --> 04:52.000
she first needed to transform.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.840
In 1629, Tiffany does appear on an English census,

04:55.840 --> 04:56.400
finally,

04:56.400 --> 04:58.320
this time for the first time,

04:58.320 --> 04:59.680
as a last name,

04:59.680 --> 05:01.680
with one Mr. Henry Tiffany,

05:01.680 --> 05:03.680
who lived and died in Hackney, London.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.680
Okay, so he wasn't born a Tiffany?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.360
Were you to track down his christening,

05:07.360 --> 05:09.440
you'd find he was Henry Tiffin at the time,

05:09.440 --> 05:11.040
but once grown up and married,

05:11.040 --> 05:14.320
the record now shows him as the first of the family of Tiffany.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.360
Why the name change?

05:15.360 --> 05:16.720
It probably wasn't one.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.720
Consistent spelling in the English language

05:18.720 --> 05:20.400
totally wasn't a thing back then.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.560
None other than Tiffin Tiffany's contemporary,

05:22.560 --> 05:23.440
William Shakespeare,

05:23.440 --> 05:25.680
never spelled his signature the same way twice.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.400
English was,

05:26.400 --> 05:27.920
and still kind of is,

05:27.920 --> 05:30.000
very whatever with the written word.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.320
So Henry Tiffin became Tiffany randomly,

05:32.320 --> 05:34.800
and because the world is just too perfect sometimes,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.360
I'm also calling it that this Mr. Tiffany,

05:37.360 --> 05:39.760
the first to appear with the last name in the English language,

05:39.760 --> 05:44.080
is directly responsible for this explosion of Tiffany's 400 years later.

05:44.080 --> 05:44.880
Come with me.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.680
So Henry Tiffany had a son in 1630,

05:47.680 --> 05:48.480
Humphrey Tiffany,

05:48.480 --> 05:51.840
who moved to the shiny New England sometime before 1660.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.600
Humphrey Tiffany took the name to America

05:53.600 --> 05:57.040
and simultaneously removed it from England as a last name,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.840
as he was Henry Tiffany's only surviving son,

05:59.840 --> 06:01.360
who would also have a son,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.520
James Tiffany in 1666.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.080
From there,

06:04.080 --> 06:07.600
James Tiffany Jr. 1697 to Ebeneezer Tiffany 1734

06:07.600 --> 06:10.320
to Comfort Tiffany 1777 to 1812,

06:10.320 --> 06:11.680
Charles Lewis Tiffany,

06:11.680 --> 06:14.560
which has caused some bulbs in the audience to light,

06:14.560 --> 06:15.760
but to follow through,

06:15.760 --> 06:17.600
Charles Lewis Tiffany with some friends

06:17.600 --> 06:20.160
established a stationary and fancy goods emporium shop

06:20.160 --> 06:23.040
named Tiffany, Young & Ellis in 1837.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.680
Charles Lewis Tiffany eventually took control of the company,

06:25.680 --> 06:28.880
changed the name to Tiffany & Co. to focus on jewelry exclusively,

06:28.880 --> 06:30.560
well, except for that period during the Civil War

06:30.560 --> 06:33.280
when he switched to manufacturing swords as the Tiffany Experience,

06:33.280 --> 06:34.960
but after that, back to jewelry.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.160
From the late 1800s,

06:36.160 --> 06:39.760
this New York City store for Tiffany was her most prominent placement

06:39.760 --> 06:41.440
since the Empress or the Astrologer,

06:41.440 --> 06:43.840
and it remained so until 1958,

06:43.840 --> 06:45.360
when Truman Capote walked by,

06:45.360 --> 06:48.720
the name caught the author's attention as underused with literary potential,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.520
and he wrote and published the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.800
Prior to this moment, Tiffany as a first name was holding on,

06:54.800 --> 06:57.920
but barely, averaging under 10 babies a year.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.240
After the novella, there's a slight uptick in the name,

07:00.240 --> 07:01.840
but that could be a coincidence,

07:01.840 --> 07:04.560
but what definitely isn't is in 1961,

07:04.560 --> 07:06.880
the novella became a movie starring Audrey Hepburn,

07:06.880 --> 07:08.320
and it would not be understatement to say

07:08.320 --> 07:12.240
that this role turned her into a time-transcending Hollywood icon

07:12.240 --> 07:14.560
forever connected with the name in the title.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.320
Tiffany had found her fame,

07:16.320 --> 07:19.520
and the following year, the Tiffany's quintupled,

07:19.520 --> 07:22.240
setting a solid base for an exponential explosion,

07:22.240 --> 07:25.040
and grew over the next 20 years as children grew,

07:25.040 --> 07:27.200
having seen the movie to have children of their own,

07:27.200 --> 07:29.200
bringing us to 1979,

07:29.200 --> 07:32.320
and there are almost 10,000 Tiffany's a year.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.960
Now, we are still on a truss of trust for this Tiffany theory.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.520
Maybe it wasn't the store-turned-story-turned-movie.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.960
It could have been a coincidence.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.240
If you look at enough random events,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.720
you can always draw some convincing correlations.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.480
But remember that in ye olden days of the 60s and early 70s,

07:46.480 --> 07:48.240
movies could only be seen in theaters,

07:48.240 --> 07:51.200
but by the late 70s, there was a new invention,

07:51.200 --> 07:53.440
VHS, the Video Home System,

07:53.440 --> 07:56.800
so you could watch movies anytime in glorious 480 pixels.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.880
And well, guess what?

07:58.880 --> 08:02.880
Breakfast at Tiffany's happens to be the first Audrey Hepburn movie

08:02.880 --> 08:07.920
released on VHS in, wait for it, 1979.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.000
And one year later,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.920
total Tiffany's doubled,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.400
rolling into the 80s torrent of Tiffany's,

08:14.400 --> 08:18.400
where the name was top 20 for 9 out of 10 years,

08:18.400 --> 08:22.960
the Tiffany ascendancy that had started with theophany in prehistory.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.200
And that is the tale of Tiffany.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.080
She's carried her neon torch through the ages,

08:28.080 --> 08:30.880
and long may she carry it into the future.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.880
To Tiffany.
