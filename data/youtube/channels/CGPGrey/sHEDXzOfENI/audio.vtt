00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
The United States picks its president with the Electoral College, 538 votes distributed

00:05.720 --> 00:09.280
by population, mostly to the 50 states and DC.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.520
To become a president you need to win a majority of those votes.

00:12.520 --> 00:18.520
But 538 is an even number, so what happens when the race for president is tied?

00:18.520 --> 00:21.720
Don't worry, there's an 18th century solution to the problem.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.720
If the Electoral College is tied, the House of Representatives breaks that tie.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.920
As the name implies, the House is filled with representatives from each of the states.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.360
The more people in a state, the more representatives it has and there are 435 in total, thankfully

00:35.360 --> 00:38.060
an odd number and a guaranteed tiebreaker.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.740
Except there's a catch.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.960
Each representative doesn't get one vote, it's each state that gets one vote.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.840
So Florida's 27 representatives have to decide amongst themselves who to support before casting

00:48.840 --> 00:51.600
Florida's one vote to help break the tie.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.120
Meanwhile, thinly populated Alaska's sole representative has only to consult himself

00:56.120 --> 00:58.460
before casting Alaska's vote.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.180
This is an incredibly disproportionate system because just 10 states â€” California, Texas,

01:03.180 --> 01:06.220
New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina

01:06.220 --> 01:10.580
â€” contain more than half the population of the United States but get only 20% of the

01:10.580 --> 01:12.900
votes if the race for president is tied.

01:12.900 --> 01:17.540
And the other 40 states with less than half the population get 80% of the votes.

01:17.540 --> 01:22.300
While an exact tie is unlikely, this system is also used if there are more than two candidates

01:22.300 --> 01:26.060
for president and none of them gets a majority in the Electoral College.

01:26.060 --> 01:30.900
Which is exactly what happened when four candidates ran for president in 1824.

01:30.900 --> 01:34.700
Andrew Jackson got the most votes from Americans and the most votes in the Electoral College

01:34.700 --> 01:39.220
but not a majority, so the race was turned over to the House of Representatives voting

01:39.220 --> 01:42.280
as states who picked John Quincy Adams instead.

01:42.280 --> 01:47.260
In a modern America with more states, a three-way race can have horrifically disproportionate

01:47.260 --> 01:48.260
results.

01:48.260 --> 01:51.780
Consider a third-party candidate who loves the small states and who the small states

01:51.780 --> 01:52.780
love in return.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.020
He gets the fewest Electoral College votes but enough to ensure that neither of the two

01:56.020 --> 01:59.960
more popular candidates gets a majority, so now the House decides the winner.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.140
And those 26 smallest states representing just 17% of the population can pick their

02:04.140 --> 02:08.900
man as president, even though 83% of Americans didn't vote for him.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.300
It's unlikely, but it really shouldn't even be possible.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.060
Anyway, all this talk of presidents has left the vice president unmentioned.

02:16.060 --> 02:20.620
A reasonable person might assume that he just comes along with the president, but no.

02:20.620 --> 02:25.420
When there's a tie, the Senate independently picks the vice president, so the United States

02:25.420 --> 02:29.720
could end up with a president from one party and a vice president from the other, which

02:29.720 --> 02:32.540
might make for some very uncomfortable meetings.

02:32.540 --> 02:36.460
But even this crazy system for resolving a tie isn't guaranteed to work because there

02:36.460 --> 02:40.220
are 100 members of the Senate, and in the House of Representatives they're forced to

02:40.220 --> 02:45.540
vote as 50 states, and many of those states have 10 or 8 representatives, making the whole

02:45.540 --> 02:49.260
system titacular with all those even numbers.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.580
So if the House can't pick the president, but the Senate has picked the vice president,

02:52.580 --> 02:56.900
then the vice president becomes acting president until the House can make up its mind.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.620
But if neither the House can pick the president, nor the Senate can pick the vice president,

03:00.620 --> 03:04.400
then the Speaker of the House becomes acting president until either branch of Congress

03:04.400 --> 03:05.740
picks someone.

03:05.740 --> 03:10.220
And that's how the United States would resolve a tied race for president, though it might

03:10.220 --> 03:13.420
be faster and more fair to just flip a coin.

03:19.260 --> 03:29.420
Of course, you could get rid of the electoral college and thus this whole crazy system and

03:29.420 --> 03:34.020
instead have a national popular vote, perhaps with something fancy like preferential voting,

03:34.020 --> 03:35.980
but maybe that's just a crazy idea.
