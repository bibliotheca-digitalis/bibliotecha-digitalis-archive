1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
The United States picks its president with the Electoral College, 538 votes distributed

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,280
by population, mostly to the 50 states and DC.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,520
To become a president you need to win a majority of those votes.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,520
But 538 is an even number, so what happens when the race for president is tied?

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,720
Don't worry, there's an 18th century solution to the problem.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,720
If the Electoral College is tied, the House of Representatives breaks that tie.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,920
As the name implies, the House is filled with representatives from each of the states.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,360
The more people in a state, the more representatives it has and there are 435 in total, thankfully

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,060
an odd number and a guaranteed tiebreaker.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,740
Except there's a catch.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,960
Each representative doesn't get one vote, it's each state that gets one vote.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,840
So Florida's 27 representatives have to decide amongst themselves who to support before casting

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Florida's one vote to help break the tie.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,120
Meanwhile, thinly populated Alaska's sole representative has only to consult himself

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,460
before casting Alaska's vote.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,180
This is an incredibly disproportionate system because just 10 states â€” California, Texas,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,220
New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,580
â€” contain more than half the population of the United States but get only 20% of the

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,900
votes if the race for president is tied.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,540
And the other 40 states with less than half the population get 80% of the votes.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,300
While an exact tie is unlikely, this system is also used if there are more than two candidates

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,060
for president and none of them gets a majority in the Electoral College.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,900
Which is exactly what happened when four candidates ran for president in 1824.

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Andrew Jackson got the most votes from Americans and the most votes in the Electoral College

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,220
but not a majority, so the race was turned over to the House of Representatives voting

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,280
as states who picked John Quincy Adams instead.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,260
In a modern America with more states, a three-way race can have horrifically disproportionate

28
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,260
results.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,780
Consider a third-party candidate who loves the small states and who the small states

30
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
love in return.

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,020
He gets the fewest Electoral College votes but enough to ensure that neither of the two

32
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,960
more popular candidates gets a majority, so now the House decides the winner.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,140
And those 26 smallest states representing just 17% of the population can pick their

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,900
man as president, even though 83% of Americans didn't vote for him.

35
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,300
It's unlikely, but it really shouldn't even be possible.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,060
Anyway, all this talk of presidents has left the vice president unmentioned.

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,620
A reasonable person might assume that he just comes along with the president, but no.

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,420
When there's a tie, the Senate independently picks the vice president, so the United States

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,720
could end up with a president from one party and a vice president from the other, which

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,540
might make for some very uncomfortable meetings.

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,460
But even this crazy system for resolving a tie isn't guaranteed to work because there

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,220
are 100 members of the Senate, and in the House of Representatives they're forced to

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,540
vote as 50 states, and many of those states have 10 or 8 representatives, making the whole

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,260
system titacular with all those even numbers.

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,580
So if the House can't pick the president, but the Senate has picked the vice president,

46
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,900
then the vice president becomes acting president until the House can make up its mind.

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,620
But if neither the House can pick the president, nor the Senate can pick the vice president,

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,400
then the Speaker of the House becomes acting president until either branch of Congress

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,740
picks someone.

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,220
And that's how the United States would resolve a tied race for president, though it might

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,420
be faster and more fair to just flip a coin.

52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:29,420
Of course, you could get rid of the electoral college and thus this whole crazy system and

53
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,020
instead have a national popular vote, perhaps with something fancy like preferential voting,

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,980
but maybe that's just a crazy idea.
