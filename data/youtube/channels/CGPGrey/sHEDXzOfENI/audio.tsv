0	5720	The United States picks its president with the Electoral College, 538 votes distributed
5720	9280	by population, mostly to the 50 states and DC.
9280	12520	To become a president you need to win a majority of those votes.
12520	18520	But 538 is an even number, so what happens when the race for president is tied?
18520	21720	Don't worry, there's an 18th century solution to the problem.
21720	25720	If the Electoral College is tied, the House of Representatives breaks that tie.
25720	29920	As the name implies, the House is filled with representatives from each of the states.
29920	35360	The more people in a state, the more representatives it has and there are 435 in total, thankfully
35360	38060	an odd number and a guaranteed tiebreaker.
38060	39740	Except there's a catch.
39740	43960	Each representative doesn't get one vote, it's each state that gets one vote.
43960	48840	So Florida's 27 representatives have to decide amongst themselves who to support before casting
48840	51600	Florida's one vote to help break the tie.
51600	56120	Meanwhile, thinly populated Alaska's sole representative has only to consult himself
56120	58460	before casting Alaska's vote.
58500	63180	This is an incredibly disproportionate system because just 10 states — California, Texas,
63180	66220	New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina
66220	70580	— contain more than half the population of the United States but get only 20% of the
70580	72900	votes if the race for president is tied.
72900	77540	And the other 40 states with less than half the population get 80% of the votes.
77540	82300	While an exact tie is unlikely, this system is also used if there are more than two candidates
82300	86060	for president and none of them gets a majority in the Electoral College.
86060	90900	Which is exactly what happened when four candidates ran for president in 1824.
90900	94700	Andrew Jackson got the most votes from Americans and the most votes in the Electoral College
94700	99220	but not a majority, so the race was turned over to the House of Representatives voting
99220	102280	as states who picked John Quincy Adams instead.
102280	107260	In a modern America with more states, a three-way race can have horrifically disproportionate
107260	108260	results.
108260	111780	Consider a third-party candidate who loves the small states and who the small states
111780	112780	love in return.
112900	116020	He gets the fewest Electoral College votes but enough to ensure that neither of the two
116020	119960	more popular candidates gets a majority, so now the House decides the winner.
119960	124140	And those 26 smallest states representing just 17% of the population can pick their
124140	128900	man as president, even though 83% of Americans didn't vote for him.
128900	132300	It's unlikely, but it really shouldn't even be possible.
132300	136060	Anyway, all this talk of presidents has left the vice president unmentioned.
136060	140620	A reasonable person might assume that he just comes along with the president, but no.
140620	145420	When there's a tie, the Senate independently picks the vice president, so the United States
145420	149720	could end up with a president from one party and a vice president from the other, which
149720	152540	might make for some very uncomfortable meetings.
152540	156460	But even this crazy system for resolving a tie isn't guaranteed to work because there
156460	160220	are 100 members of the Senate, and in the House of Representatives they're forced to
160220	165540	vote as 50 states, and many of those states have 10 or 8 representatives, making the whole
165540	169260	system titacular with all those even numbers.
169260	172580	So if the House can't pick the president, but the Senate has picked the vice president,
172580	176900	then the vice president becomes acting president until the House can make up its mind.
176900	180620	But if neither the House can pick the president, nor the Senate can pick the vice president,
180620	184400	then the Speaker of the House becomes acting president until either branch of Congress
184400	185740	picks someone.
185740	190220	And that's how the United States would resolve a tied race for president, though it might
190220	193420	be faster and more fair to just flip a coin.
199260	209420	Of course, you could get rid of the electoral college and thus this whole crazy system and
209420	214020	instead have a national popular vote, perhaps with something fancy like preferential voting,
214020	215980	but maybe that's just a crazy idea.
