Military bases and embassies, contrary to popular opinion, don't count as American soil, though they're close.

00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:15,600
The country hosting the base agrees that her laws don't apply within the base, but the base is still on her land, that she owns, because it's hers, in her country.

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,800
This is called extraterritoriality and it isn't unique to the United States, but it's notable with her because of its frequency and, in one case, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, contention.

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,200
The short version of this story is Cuba used to be a U.S. territory, taken after the Spanish-American war with Puerto Rico and Guam and Spain's pride.

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,800
Cuba eventually went her own way, but the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay stayed where it was and the U.S. paid to rent the land.

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,300
But then, revolucion and disagreement between Cuba and the U.S. over the rent leading to the current awkward situation where the U.S. says to Cuba,

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Thank you for renting us this land. And Cuba says, We didn't rent you that land. And the U.S. says, Here's our rent payment. And Cuba says, We don't accept that. Please leave.

00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
And the U.S. says, Thank you for renting us this land.
