1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey, what's going on with Brexit?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
Well, there sure has been a lot of political squabbling here at ground level.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Let's float away from all that for a look at the big picture.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,100
Up here, it's easier to see the 1, 2, 3 of the impossible trinity.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,020
But first, quick British Isles primer.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,000
The United Kingdom contains England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,240
This last part of the United Kingdom shares the island of Ireland with the country of

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Ireland.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,640
This Ireland is in the European Union, and the United Kingdom isâ€¦ well, that's the

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,020
whole thing, isn't it?

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,380
Before UK voted to Brexit, the European Union wall encircled them all.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,380
The wall isn't literal.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,220
It's a metaphor for the overlapping circles of EU institutions and border complications

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,100
impossible to draw, so it's a metaphor wall.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,600
Maximum Brexit is the exit, where UK leaves to build her own wall separate from the EU

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,740
and be like any other country.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,720
This maximum Brexit is the top of the trinity, with a wall around the UK, which, following

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,220
the border, would go straight across the Irish island.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,100
Ho ho, oh no.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,660
The books on Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the UK's long and complicated and sometimes

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,780
frightening relationship are not tomes to be opened here.

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,260
The much shorter and safer version is there used to be a wall between the Ireland's, but

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,980
there was a lot of the violence and a lot of the troubles until, on a very good Friday,

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,740
Ireland and the UK agreed there would never be a wall between them again.

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,740
Full stop.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,040
This, while it didn't uncomplicate the relationship, at least made it non-violent.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,020
A new wall ploughing between them would break this vital political promise.

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,920
Thus, UK and Ireland and even EU all agree.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,420
A wall here is super no bueno.

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,460
No wall across Ireland is the second vertex of the impossible trinity.

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,980
Wait, why do we need a wall anyway?

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,620
Oh right, the maximum Brexit creates a land border with the EU because UK is an island

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,540
unto herself, mostly, but not completely.

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,400
So if UK says this is unacceptable and all agree this is unacceptable then the wall could

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,380
go here maybe?

36
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,420
Ah, compromise.

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,760
UK tries to march out of the EU, but not everybody makes it.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,880
Northern Ireland stays in the EU, sort of, on the other side of the wall while still

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,500
being part of the UK, while the EU whispers into her ear that were she to let go and unite

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
with Ireland.

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
That's cool with the EU.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Ain't no thing, girl.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Poor Northern Ireland.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,980
She's on Ireland but mostly thinks of herself as British but also Irish but could end up

45
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,740
being the last part of the UK in the EU while also having the right to leave the UK and

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,860
join Ireland if she ever votes to.

47
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,780
For UK, this situation means a wall inside the United Kingdom.

48
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,660
No nation wants to create an external wall through internal territory.

49
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,780
Thus, the final vertex of the trinity.

50
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,700
No walls inside the UK.

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,580
Leaving Northern Ireland behind while staying connected to her also means some of those

52
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,940
overlapping EU institutions can pass through the wall, making Britain's Brexit rather

53
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,620
less than maximum.

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,640
And political geography being what it is, that's it for options.

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,700
This this or this.

56
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,500
All of which the UK refuses.

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,740
But you wanted the wall in a different place.

58
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,660
That was like your whole thing.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
None of these are acceptable.

60
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,100
Thus, the impossible trinity where the UK must pick a side.

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,940
Promising no walls means no maximum Brexit.

62
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,520
Promising maximum Brexit means there's gotta be a wall somewhere.

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,800
And so for a long time, nothing of consequence happened.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,280
Can you pick now?

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,400
What if I put the wall here, but only temporarily?

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,860
That doesn't solve anything.

67
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,120
That just kicks the Northern Ireland down the road until we're right back where we started.

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,560
So that's what's been going on with Brexit.

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,220
There's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution.

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,380
And ultimately, there's no avoiding the trinity.

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,760
There's three things.

72
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:30,420
Pick two.

73
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,020
You can go now.
