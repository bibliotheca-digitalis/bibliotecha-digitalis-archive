00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Hey, what's going on with Brexit?

00:04.080 --> 00:08.800
Well, there sure has been a lot of political squabbling here at ground level.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.760
Let's float away from all that for a look at the big picture.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.100
Up here, it's easier to see the 1, 2, 3 of the impossible trinity.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.020
But first, quick British Isles primer.

00:17.020 --> 00:20.000
The United Kingdom contains England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.240
This last part of the United Kingdom shares the island of Ireland with the country of

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
Ireland.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.640
This Ireland is in the European Union, and the United Kingdom isâ€¦ well, that's the

00:27.640 --> 00:29.020
whole thing, isn't it?

00:29.040 --> 00:32.380
Before UK voted to Brexit, the European Union wall encircled them all.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.380
The wall isn't literal.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.220
It's a metaphor for the overlapping circles of EU institutions and border complications

00:36.220 --> 00:39.100
impossible to draw, so it's a metaphor wall.

00:39.100 --> 00:42.600
Maximum Brexit is the exit, where UK leaves to build her own wall separate from the EU

00:42.600 --> 00:44.740
and be like any other country.

00:44.740 --> 00:48.720
This maximum Brexit is the top of the trinity, with a wall around the UK, which, following

00:48.720 --> 00:52.220
the border, would go straight across the Irish island.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.100
Ho ho, oh no.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.660
The books on Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the UK's long and complicated and sometimes

00:58.660 --> 01:01.780
frightening relationship are not tomes to be opened here.

01:01.780 --> 01:05.260
The much shorter and safer version is there used to be a wall between the Ireland's, but

01:05.260 --> 01:08.980
there was a lot of the violence and a lot of the troubles until, on a very good Friday,

01:08.980 --> 01:11.740
Ireland and the UK agreed there would never be a wall between them again.

01:11.740 --> 01:12.740
Full stop.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.040
This, while it didn't uncomplicate the relationship, at least made it non-violent.

01:16.040 --> 01:20.020
A new wall ploughing between them would break this vital political promise.

01:20.020 --> 01:22.920
Thus, UK and Ireland and even EU all agree.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.420
A wall here is super no bueno.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.460
No wall across Ireland is the second vertex of the impossible trinity.

01:28.460 --> 01:29.980
Wait, why do we need a wall anyway?

01:29.980 --> 01:33.620
Oh right, the maximum Brexit creates a land border with the EU because UK is an island

01:33.620 --> 01:35.540
unto herself, mostly, but not completely.

01:35.540 --> 01:39.400
So if UK says this is unacceptable and all agree this is unacceptable then the wall could

01:39.400 --> 01:41.380
go here maybe?

01:41.380 --> 01:43.420
Ah, compromise.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.760
UK tries to march out of the EU, but not everybody makes it.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.880
Northern Ireland stays in the EU, sort of, on the other side of the wall while still

01:49.880 --> 01:54.500
being part of the UK, while the EU whispers into her ear that were she to let go and unite

01:54.500 --> 01:55.500
with Ireland.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.500
That's cool with the EU.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.500
Ain't no thing, girl.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.500
Poor Northern Ireland.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.980
She's on Ireland but mostly thinks of herself as British but also Irish but could end up

02:02.980 --> 02:07.740
being the last part of the UK in the EU while also having the right to leave the UK and

02:07.740 --> 02:09.860
join Ireland if she ever votes to.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.780
For UK, this situation means a wall inside the United Kingdom.

02:13.780 --> 02:17.660
No nation wants to create an external wall through internal territory.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.780
Thus, the final vertex of the trinity.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.700
No walls inside the UK.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.580
Leaving Northern Ireland behind while staying connected to her also means some of those

02:24.580 --> 02:28.940
overlapping EU institutions can pass through the wall, making Britain's Brexit rather

02:28.940 --> 02:30.620
less than maximum.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.640
And political geography being what it is, that's it for options.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.700
This this or this.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.500
All of which the UK refuses.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.740
But you wanted the wall in a different place.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.660
That was like your whole thing.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.660
None of these are acceptable.

02:41.660 --> 02:45.100
Thus, the impossible trinity where the UK must pick a side.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.940
Promising no walls means no maximum Brexit.

02:47.940 --> 02:51.520
Promising maximum Brexit means there's gotta be a wall somewhere.

02:51.520 --> 02:58.800
And so for a long time, nothing of consequence happened.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.280
Can you pick now?

03:02.280 --> 03:07.400
What if I put the wall here, but only temporarily?

03:07.400 --> 03:08.860
That doesn't solve anything.

03:08.860 --> 03:12.120
That just kicks the Northern Ireland down the road until we're right back where we started.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.560
So that's what's been going on with Brexit.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.220
There's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution.

03:17.220 --> 03:20.380
And ultimately, there's no avoiding the trinity.

03:20.380 --> 03:21.760
There's three things.

03:21.760 --> 03:30.420
Pick two.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.020
You can go now.
