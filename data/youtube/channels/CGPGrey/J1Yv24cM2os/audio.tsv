0	4080	Hey, what's going on with Brexit?
4080	8800	Well, there sure has been a lot of political squabbling here at ground level.
8800	11760	Let's float away from all that for a look at the big picture.
11760	15100	Up here, it's easier to see the 1, 2, 3 of the impossible trinity.
15100	17020	But first, quick British Isles primer.
17020	20000	The United Kingdom contains England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
20000	23240	This last part of the United Kingdom shares the island of Ireland with the country of
23240	24240	Ireland.
24240	27640	This Ireland is in the European Union, and the United Kingdom isâ€¦ well, that's the
27640	29020	whole thing, isn't it?
29040	32380	Before UK voted to Brexit, the European Union wall encircled them all.
32380	33380	The wall isn't literal.
33380	36220	It's a metaphor for the overlapping circles of EU institutions and border complications
36220	39100	impossible to draw, so it's a metaphor wall.
39100	42600	Maximum Brexit is the exit, where UK leaves to build her own wall separate from the EU
42600	44740	and be like any other country.
44740	48720	This maximum Brexit is the top of the trinity, with a wall around the UK, which, following
48720	52220	the border, would go straight across the Irish island.
52220	55100	Ho ho, oh no.
55100	58660	The books on Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the UK's long and complicated and sometimes
58660	61780	frightening relationship are not tomes to be opened here.
61780	65260	The much shorter and safer version is there used to be a wall between the Ireland's, but
65260	68980	there was a lot of the violence and a lot of the troubles until, on a very good Friday,
68980	71740	Ireland and the UK agreed there would never be a wall between them again.
71740	72740	Full stop.
72740	76040	This, while it didn't uncomplicate the relationship, at least made it non-violent.
76040	80020	A new wall ploughing between them would break this vital political promise.
80020	82920	Thus, UK and Ireland and even EU all agree.
82920	85420	A wall here is super no bueno.
85420	88460	No wall across Ireland is the second vertex of the impossible trinity.
88460	89980	Wait, why do we need a wall anyway?
89980	93620	Oh right, the maximum Brexit creates a land border with the EU because UK is an island
93620	95540	unto herself, mostly, but not completely.
95540	99400	So if UK says this is unacceptable and all agree this is unacceptable then the wall could
99400	101380	go here maybe?
101380	103420	Ah, compromise.
103420	106760	UK tries to march out of the EU, but not everybody makes it.
106760	109880	Northern Ireland stays in the EU, sort of, on the other side of the wall while still
109880	114500	being part of the UK, while the EU whispers into her ear that were she to let go and unite
114500	115500	with Ireland.
115500	116500	That's cool with the EU.
116500	117500	Ain't no thing, girl.
117500	118500	Poor Northern Ireland.
118500	122980	She's on Ireland but mostly thinks of herself as British but also Irish but could end up
122980	127740	being the last part of the UK in the EU while also having the right to leave the UK and
127740	129860	join Ireland if she ever votes to.
129860	133780	For UK, this situation means a wall inside the United Kingdom.
133780	137660	No nation wants to create an external wall through internal territory.
137660	139780	Thus, the final vertex of the trinity.
139780	141700	No walls inside the UK.
141700	144580	Leaving Northern Ireland behind while staying connected to her also means some of those
144580	148940	overlapping EU institutions can pass through the wall, making Britain's Brexit rather
148940	150620	less than maximum.
150620	153640	And political geography being what it is, that's it for options.
153640	154700	This this or this.
154700	156500	All of which the UK refuses.
156500	158740	But you wanted the wall in a different place.
158740	160660	That was like your whole thing.
160660	161660	None of these are acceptable.
161660	165100	Thus, the impossible trinity where the UK must pick a side.
165100	167940	Promising no walls means no maximum Brexit.
167940	171520	Promising maximum Brexit means there's gotta be a wall somewhere.
171520	178800	And so for a long time, nothing of consequence happened.
178800	182280	Can you pick now?
182280	187400	What if I put the wall here, but only temporarily?
187400	188860	That doesn't solve anything.
188860	192120	That just kicks the Northern Ireland down the road until we're right back where we started.
192120	194560	So that's what's been going on with Brexit.
194560	197220	There's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution.
197220	200380	And ultimately, there's no avoiding the trinity.
200380	201760	There's three things.
201760	210420	Pick two.
210420	211020	You can go now.
