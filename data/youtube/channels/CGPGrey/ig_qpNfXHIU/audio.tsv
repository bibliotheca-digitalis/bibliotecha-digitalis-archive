0	2880	Rulers are so often related.
2880	6720	Power passes from member to member, forming a dynasty.
6720	12720	Not just with royalty or dictators, but also with representatives in a democracy.
12720	20000	Families pass power or vie with other families for a turn at the top, much more than chance would have.
20000	23680	Dynasties seem so natural you may never have deeply considered them,
23680	29120	but you must if you wish to grasp and hold power as long as possible.
29120	32800	Even if you follow the rules for rulers we have discussed,
32800	37280	swaying the keys to power, securing the treasure, and controlling the court,
37280	39920	no man rules forever.
39920	44960	Dictators with resources abundant and power unchallenged still die,
44960	50000	and representatives must contend with death, both literal and political.
50000	55600	But no matter what kind of ruler you are, your keys to power value their treasure.
55600	60320	They keep you in your position, not for love of you in particular,
60320	63440	but for the rewards you provide in general.
63440	66560	But dead rulers can't distribute treasure.
66560	71440	Thus, as your grave approaches, your key supporters get nervous.
71440	75760	Your impending death forces your keys to plan for your replacement,
75760	77840	not just to maintain their treasure,
77840	82080	but also because a dead ruler's surprise, without plans in place,
82080	86080	will lead to a scramble for power at best and a bloodbath at worst,
86080	90720	leaving many keys on the inside now, on the outside after.
90720	95520	This is why, if you happen to be sick, keep it secret.
95520	98880	If your keys even think you might die on them,
98880	103280	they must start planning for the next ruler to avoid this.
103280	108400	Which is what makes even a rumor about the ruler's health concerning.
108480	114880	Whispers about your health are a destabilizing poison in the minds of your key supporters,
114880	117200	nearly impossible to remove.
117200	120320	To the keys, your replacement is inevitable anyway,
120320	123280	so why not start planning sooner, just in case?
123280	127760	Thus, after a rumor, the keys might seem to stay on your side in their actions,
127760	130400	but you're already dead in their minds.
130400	135280	You've lost control and will lose your throne sooner than you like.
135280	137920	But while you can't defend against the reaper,
137920	141360	or extract poison from the minds of your key supporters,
141360	145360	there is a way to defend your power in this world,
145360	147920	from rumors of your departure to the next.
149680	151440	Family is the answer.
151440	154480	Dictatorships and democracies have so much family rule,
154480	156960	because the key supporters want it.
156960	161280	As your term limit or deathbed approach, your family is there,
161280	164000	ready to keep turning the machinery of power,
164000	168560	keep raising the treasure, keep the keys calm and plot-free.
168560	172000	Sure, warm-hearted rulers may want to give their family advantages,
172000	174080	and being the ruler comes with many,
174080	179120	but the key supporters also want the ruler's family in positions of power,
179120	182720	because the family that plots together rules together.
182720	186880	Generational power transcending death and term limits.
186880	190400	Thus, your keys get to worry less about transitions of power,
190400	194800	and you get to worry less about their plans for your replacement.
194800	198560	While key supporters won't ever simply trust you and your family,
198560	202320	the keys can look at the motivating interests of you all.
202320	205840	Calculating that sticking with your family during a transition
205840	209200	gives them better odds of staying on the inside,
209200	213920	because they know you and your relatives also calculate.
213920	216800	Sticking with the keys during a transition
216800	220240	gives you better odds of staying on the throne.
220240	225440	It's a virtuous cycle, formed by calculations that are like trust, but better.
225440	228880	The ruler gets to rule longer, the keys get to worry less,
228880	234320	and everything is smooth, because when the king is dead, long live the king.
234320	238640	So put family in high-ranking military, business, or political positions.
238640	243440	Never mind their qualifications, because being family is the qualification.
243440	245760	They must work with your key supporters,
245760	249360	so they know where the money comes from and how it is distributed.
249360	253280	Families' relationships with the keys keep everyone calm,
253280	255120	not just during the transition,
255120	259840	but more importantly for you and your political longevity preceding it.
259840	264240	So even if you have no interest in a spouse and have no love for babies,
264240	266240	nonetheless, acquire them.
266240	270640	Of course, the risk you run with family is they too will overthrow you.
270640	273600	Many a cunning prince has stabbed his king in the back,
273600	276080	once confident the keys won't mind.
276080	277680	But nothing is certain.
277680	279840	You can only play the odds,
279840	284880	and a ruler without family is more vulnerable to rivals and rumors.
284880	290240	Remember, your keys care about the security of their treasure in general,
290240	292160	not you in particular.
292160	296320	And for them, a family of rulers is a safer investment.
296320	299440	Thus, possible regicide is the price you pay
299440	303520	for buying the longer and secure rein a family brings,
303520	309520	which is why families are so popular among rulers and their key supporters.
309520	314960	Family is a tool for maintaining power just like any other.
