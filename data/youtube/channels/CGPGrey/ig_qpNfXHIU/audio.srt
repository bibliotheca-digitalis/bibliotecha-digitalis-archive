1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Rulers are so often related.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,720
Power passes from member to member, forming a dynasty.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,720
Not just with royalty or dictators, but also with representatives in a democracy.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,000
Families pass power or vie with other families for a turn at the top, much more than chance would have.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,680
Dynasties seem so natural you may never have deeply considered them,

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,120
but you must if you wish to grasp and hold power as long as possible.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,800
Even if you follow the rules for rulers we have discussed,

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
swaying the keys to power, securing the treasure, and controlling the court,

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,920
no man rules forever.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
Dictators with resources abundant and power unchallenged still die,

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,000
and representatives must contend with death, both literal and political.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,600
But no matter what kind of ruler you are, your keys to power value their treasure.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,320
They keep you in your position, not for love of you in particular,

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,440
but for the rewards you provide in general.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
But dead rulers can't distribute treasure.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,440
Thus, as your grave approaches, your key supporters get nervous.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,760
Your impending death forces your keys to plan for your replacement,

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,840
not just to maintain their treasure,

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
but also because a dead ruler's surprise, without plans in place,

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
will lead to a scramble for power at best and a bloodbath at worst,

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
leaving many keys on the inside now, on the outside after.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
This is why, if you happen to be sick, keep it secret.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
If your keys even think you might die on them,

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
they must start planning for the next ruler to avoid this.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,400
Which is what makes even a rumor about the ruler's health concerning.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,880
Whispers about your health are a destabilizing poison in the minds of your key supporters,

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,200
nearly impossible to remove.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
To the keys, your replacement is inevitable anyway,

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
so why not start planning sooner, just in case?

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,760
Thus, after a rumor, the keys might seem to stay on your side in their actions,

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,400
but you're already dead in their minds.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,280
You've lost control and will lose your throne sooner than you like.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,920
But while you can't defend against the reaper,

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
or extract poison from the minds of your key supporters,

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
there is a way to defend your power in this world,

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
from rumors of your departure to the next.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
Family is the answer.

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
Dictatorships and democracies have so much family rule,

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,960
because the key supporters want it.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,280
As your term limit or deathbed approach, your family is there,

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
ready to keep turning the machinery of power,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
keep raising the treasure, keep the keys calm and plot-free.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Sure, warm-hearted rulers may want to give their family advantages,

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
and being the ruler comes with many,

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
but the key supporters also want the ruler's family in positions of power,

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
because the family that plots together rules together.

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,880
Generational power transcending death and term limits.

48
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,400
Thus, your keys get to worry less about transitions of power,

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
and you get to worry less about their plans for your replacement.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
While key supporters won't ever simply trust you and your family,

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,320
the keys can look at the motivating interests of you all.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,840
Calculating that sticking with your family during a transition

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
gives them better odds of staying on the inside,

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,920
because they know you and your relatives also calculate.

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,800
Sticking with the keys during a transition

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,240
gives you better odds of staying on the throne.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,440
It's a virtuous cycle, formed by calculations that are like trust, but better.

58
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,880
The ruler gets to rule longer, the keys get to worry less,

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,320
and everything is smooth, because when the king is dead, long live the king.

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,640
So put family in high-ranking military, business, or political positions.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Never mind their qualifications, because being family is the qualification.

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,760
They must work with your key supporters,

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
so they know where the money comes from and how it is distributed.

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,280
Families' relationships with the keys keep everyone calm,

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
not just during the transition,

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,840
but more importantly for you and your political longevity preceding it.

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
So even if you have no interest in a spouse and have no love for babies,

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
nonetheless, acquire them.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,640
Of course, the risk you run with family is they too will overthrow you.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,600
Many a cunning prince has stabbed his king in the back,

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
once confident the keys won't mind.

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
But nothing is certain.

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,840
You can only play the odds,

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,880
and a ruler without family is more vulnerable to rivals and rumors.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,240
Remember, your keys care about the security of their treasure in general,

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
not you in particular.

77
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
And for them, a family of rulers is a safer investment.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
Thus, possible regicide is the price you pay

79
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,520
for buying the longer and secure rein a family brings,

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,520
which is why families are so popular among rulers and their key supporters.

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,960
Family is a tool for maintaining power just like any other.

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,240
