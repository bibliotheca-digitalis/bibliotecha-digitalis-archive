00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
Rulers are so often related.

00:02.880 --> 00:06.720
Power passes from member to member, forming a dynasty.

00:06.720 --> 00:12.720
Not just with royalty or dictators, but also with representatives in a democracy.

00:12.720 --> 00:20.000
Families pass power or vie with other families for a turn at the top, much more than chance would have.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.680
Dynasties seem so natural you may never have deeply considered them,

00:23.680 --> 00:29.120
but you must if you wish to grasp and hold power as long as possible.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.800
Even if you follow the rules for rulers we have discussed,

00:32.800 --> 00:37.280
swaying the keys to power, securing the treasure, and controlling the court,

00:37.280 --> 00:39.920
no man rules forever.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.960
Dictators with resources abundant and power unchallenged still die,

00:44.960 --> 00:50.000
and representatives must contend with death, both literal and political.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.600
But no matter what kind of ruler you are, your keys to power value their treasure.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.320
They keep you in your position, not for love of you in particular,

01:00.320 --> 01:03.440
but for the rewards you provide in general.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.560
But dead rulers can't distribute treasure.

01:06.560 --> 01:11.440
Thus, as your grave approaches, your key supporters get nervous.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.760
Your impending death forces your keys to plan for your replacement,

01:15.760 --> 01:17.840
not just to maintain their treasure,

01:17.840 --> 01:22.080
but also because a dead ruler's surprise, without plans in place,

01:22.080 --> 01:26.080
will lead to a scramble for power at best and a bloodbath at worst,

01:26.080 --> 01:30.720
leaving many keys on the inside now, on the outside after.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.520
This is why, if you happen to be sick, keep it secret.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.880
If your keys even think you might die on them,

01:38.880 --> 01:43.280
they must start planning for the next ruler to avoid this.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.400
Which is what makes even a rumor about the ruler's health concerning.

01:48.480 --> 01:54.880
Whispers about your health are a destabilizing poison in the minds of your key supporters,

01:54.880 --> 01:57.200
nearly impossible to remove.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.320
To the keys, your replacement is inevitable anyway,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.280
so why not start planning sooner, just in case?

02:03.280 --> 02:07.760
Thus, after a rumor, the keys might seem to stay on your side in their actions,

02:07.760 --> 02:10.400
but you're already dead in their minds.

02:10.400 --> 02:15.280
You've lost control and will lose your throne sooner than you like.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.920
But while you can't defend against the reaper,

02:17.920 --> 02:21.360
or extract poison from the minds of your key supporters,

02:21.360 --> 02:25.360
there is a way to defend your power in this world,

02:25.360 --> 02:27.920
from rumors of your departure to the next.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.440
Family is the answer.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.480
Dictatorships and democracies have so much family rule,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.960
because the key supporters want it.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.280
As your term limit or deathbed approach, your family is there,

02:41.280 --> 02:44.000
ready to keep turning the machinery of power,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.560
keep raising the treasure, keep the keys calm and plot-free.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.000
Sure, warm-hearted rulers may want to give their family advantages,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.080
and being the ruler comes with many,

02:54.080 --> 02:59.120
but the key supporters also want the ruler's family in positions of power,

02:59.120 --> 03:02.720
because the family that plots together rules together.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.880
Generational power transcending death and term limits.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.400
Thus, your keys get to worry less about transitions of power,

03:10.400 --> 03:14.800
and you get to worry less about their plans for your replacement.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.560
While key supporters won't ever simply trust you and your family,

03:18.560 --> 03:22.320
the keys can look at the motivating interests of you all.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.840
Calculating that sticking with your family during a transition

03:25.840 --> 03:29.200
gives them better odds of staying on the inside,

03:29.200 --> 03:33.920
because they know you and your relatives also calculate.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.800
Sticking with the keys during a transition

03:36.800 --> 03:40.240
gives you better odds of staying on the throne.

03:40.240 --> 03:45.440
It's a virtuous cycle, formed by calculations that are like trust, but better.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.880
The ruler gets to rule longer, the keys get to worry less,

03:48.880 --> 03:54.320
and everything is smooth, because when the king is dead, long live the king.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.640
So put family in high-ranking military, business, or political positions.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.440
Never mind their qualifications, because being family is the qualification.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.760
They must work with your key supporters,

04:05.760 --> 04:09.360
so they know where the money comes from and how it is distributed.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.280
Families' relationships with the keys keep everyone calm,

04:13.280 --> 04:15.120
not just during the transition,

04:15.120 --> 04:19.840
but more importantly for you and your political longevity preceding it.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.240
So even if you have no interest in a spouse and have no love for babies,

04:24.240 --> 04:26.240
nonetheless, acquire them.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.640
Of course, the risk you run with family is they too will overthrow you.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.600
Many a cunning prince has stabbed his king in the back,

04:33.600 --> 04:36.080
once confident the keys won't mind.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.680
But nothing is certain.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.840
You can only play the odds,

04:39.840 --> 04:44.880
and a ruler without family is more vulnerable to rivals and rumors.

04:44.880 --> 04:50.240
Remember, your keys care about the security of their treasure in general,

04:50.240 --> 04:52.160
not you in particular.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.320
And for them, a family of rulers is a safer investment.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.440
Thus, possible regicide is the price you pay

04:59.440 --> 05:03.520
for buying the longer and secure rein a family brings,

05:03.520 --> 05:09.520
which is why families are so popular among rulers and their key supporters.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.960
Family is a tool for maintaining power just like any other.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.240
