0	4840	In a fair democracy, everyone's votes should count equally, but the method that the United
4840	8840	States uses to elect its president, called the Electoral College, violates this principle
8840	12280	by making sure that some people's votes are more equal than others.
12280	17360	The Electoral College is, essentially, the 538 votes that determine who wins the presidency.
17360	22040	If these votes were split evenly across the population, every 574,000 people would be
22040	23900	represented by one vote.
23900	27800	But that's not what happens because the Electoral College doesn't give votes to people, only
27800	30560	states, which has some unfair consequences.
30560	34820	For example, there are 11.5 million people in Ohio, so, to fairly represent them, it
34820	36900	should get 20 electoral votes.
36900	41320	But the Electoral College doesn't give Ohio 20 votes, it only gets 18, 2 less than it
41320	42320	should.
42320	43520	Where do those other votes go?
43520	44920	To states like Rhode Island.
44920	48840	Plucky Rhode Island has 1.1 million people in it, so it should have about 2 votes, but
48840	50340	instead it gets 4.
50340	53920	Those extra 2 votes that should be representing Ohioans go to representing Rhode Islanders
53920	54920	instead.
54920	55920	Why?
56000	59480	According to the rules of the Electoral College, every state, no matter how few people live
59480	63960	there, gets 3 votes to start with before the rest are distributed according to population.
63960	67120	Because of this rule, there are a lot of states with a few people that should only have one
67120	70180	or two votes for president, but instead get 3 or 4.
70180	74040	So Georgians, Virginians, Michiganders, and Jerseyites are each missing one vote.
74040	77900	Pennsylvanians, North Carolinians, Ohioans, and Hoosiers are missing 2, Floridians are
77900	83880	missing 4, New Yorkers 5, Texans 6, and Californians are 10 votes short of what they should get.
83880	86880	Because of this vote redistribution, the Electoral College essentially pretends that
86880	90320	fewer people live where they do and more people live where they don't.
90320	93760	An American who lives in one of these states has their vote for president count for less
93760	96120	than an American who lives in one of these states.
96120	99400	In some cases, the Electoral College bends the results just a little, but if you live
99400	102700	in a particularly large or small state, it bends them a lot.
102700	106840	One Vermonters vote, according to the Electoral College, is worth 3 Texans votes, and one
106840	109700	Wyomingites vote is worth 4 Californians.
109700	113420	Now whoa, hold on there son, you might be saying to yourself right now, you're missing
113460	116900	the whole point of the Electoral College, it's to protect the small states from the
116900	117900	big states.
117900	121100	Give the small states more voting power and the presidential candidates will have to pay
121100	123180	them more attention in an election.
123180	126660	If that's the goal of the Electoral College, it's failing spectacularly.
126660	129700	Here's a graph showing the number of visits the presidential candidates paid to each of
129700	132580	the states in the last two months of the previous election.
132580	136740	If it looks like there are a few states missing, you're right, only 18 of the 50 states received
136740	140860	even a single visit from a candidate, and just two of those states, Maine and New Hampshire,
140860	142780	have very small populations.
142780	146240	The area of the country with the most small states is conspicuously missing.
146240	150140	The Electoral College doesn't make candidates care about small states.
150140	154320	But interestingly, the biggest states, California, Texas and New York, are missing as well.
154320	155680	So what's going on?
155680	160500	Looking closer, just four states, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia, received a majority
160500	162980	of the candidates' attention during the election.
162980	165500	And if you follow the money, it's the same story.
165500	169180	Why do candidates spend so much money and time in so few states?
169180	172220	Because the way the Electoral College works forces them to do so.
172220	173960	The elections are winner-take-all.
173960	179020	As long as a candidate gets just over 50% of the popular vote in a state, he wins 100%
179020	180980	of that state's electoral votes.
180980	184300	That means winning by millions of citizens' votes is no better than winning by a single
184300	185300	vote.
185300	188220	So candidates are safe to ignore states where they poll with big margins.
188220	192060	Instead, the Electoral College makes candidates intensely interested in the needs of just
192060	196140	a few states with close races to the detriment of almost all Americans, which is why it should
196140	197900	be abolished.
197900	199300	But wait, you might say.
199300	202740	Would abolishing the Electoral College and voting directly for president cause candidates
202740	204880	to spend all their time in big cities?
204880	207060	That wouldn't be fair to most Americans either.
207060	211600	This sounds like a reasonable fear, but ignores the mathematical reality of population distribution.
211600	215100	There are 309 million people in the United States, only 8 million of which live in New
215100	217180	York, the largest city by far.
217180	219820	That's 2.6% of the total population.
219820	222300	But after New York, the size of cities drops fast.
222300	225800	LA has 3.8 million people and Chicago has 2.7.
225800	229520	But you can't even make it to the 10th biggest city, San Jose, before you're under a million
229520	230520	people.
230520	235260	These top 10 cities added together are only 7.9% of the popular vote, hardly enough to
235260	236480	win an election.
236480	240520	And even winning the next 90 biggest cities in the United States all the way down to Spokane
240520	243640	is still not yet 20% of the total population.
243640	247080	So unless there's a city with a few hundred million people hiding somewhere in America
247080	250440	that's been left out of the census, the idea that a candidate can just spend their campaign
250440	254960	jetting between New York, LA and Chicago while ignoring everyone else and still become president
254960	257060	is mathematically ludicrous.
257060	259400	Want to see the real way to unfairly win?
259400	263560	How you can become president with only 22% of the popular vote by taking advantage of
263560	265400	the electoral college today.
265400	267560	Don't believe that's possible in a democracy?
267560	268560	Just watch.
268560	269680	Here's the action plan.
269680	273600	Win the votes of the people who count the most and ignore the people who count the least.
273600	279080	Start with Wyoming, the state where 0.18% of Americans live but who get 0.56% of the
279080	281160	electoral college votes for president.
281560	284800	And because it's a winner take all system, you don't need all of them to vote for you,
284800	288440	just half plus one or 0.09%.
288440	292320	Next up is the District of Columbia where winning 0.1% of the population gets you an
292320	296080	additional 0.56% of the electoral college.
296080	299120	Then add in wins in Vermont and North Dakota and Alaska.
299120	301980	Notice how the votes you're getting to win the presidency go up much faster than the
301980	306720	percent of the population who voted for you because of the electoral college's rules.
306720	311640	Next is South Dakota, then Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii,
311640	316960	Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi,
316960	321680	Iowa, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Colorado,
321680	324960	Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts,
324960	326400	Virginia and New Jersey.
326400	330680	Congratulations by taking advantage of the unfair rules and winning states, not people,
330680	336160	you've won a majority in the electoral college even though 78% of the population voted against
336160	337160	you.
337160	340360	This is not democracy, this is indefensible.
340360	344020	While this particular scenario is unlikely, if you have a voting system that allows losers
344020	346500	to win you shouldn't be surprised when they do.
346500	350080	Not once, not twice, but thrice in American history the candidate with the most votes
350080	353820	from the people actually lost because of the electoral college.
353820	357540	Three errors in 55 plus elections is a failure rate of 5%.
357540	361200	Would anyone tolerate a sport where, by a quirk of the rules, there was a 5% chance
361200	362600	that the loser would win?
362600	363800	Not likely.
363800	366820	And how much more important electing the President of the United States is, that's a rather
366820	370100	dangerously high percentage of the time to get it wrong.
370100	374040	If we abolish the electoral college and simply let citizens vote for the president directly,
374040	376920	all of these problems will go away and everyone's vote will be equal.
