00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
In a fair democracy, everyone's votes should count equally, but the method that the United

00:04.840 --> 00:08.840
States uses to elect its president, called the Electoral College, violates this principle

00:08.840 --> 00:12.280
by making sure that some people's votes are more equal than others.

00:12.280 --> 00:17.360
The Electoral College is, essentially, the 538 votes that determine who wins the presidency.

00:17.360 --> 00:22.040
If these votes were split evenly across the population, every 574,000 people would be

00:22.040 --> 00:23.900
represented by one vote.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.800
But that's not what happens because the Electoral College doesn't give votes to people, only

00:27.800 --> 00:30.560
states, which has some unfair consequences.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.820
For example, there are 11.5 million people in Ohio, so, to fairly represent them, it

00:34.820 --> 00:36.900
should get 20 electoral votes.

00:36.900 --> 00:41.320
But the Electoral College doesn't give Ohio 20 votes, it only gets 18, 2 less than it

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
should.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.520
Where do those other votes go?

00:43.520 --> 00:44.920
To states like Rhode Island.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.840
Plucky Rhode Island has 1.1 million people in it, so it should have about 2 votes, but

00:48.840 --> 00:50.340
instead it gets 4.

00:50.340 --> 00:53.920
Those extra 2 votes that should be representing Ohioans go to representing Rhode Islanders

00:53.920 --> 00:54.920
instead.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
Why?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.480
According to the rules of the Electoral College, every state, no matter how few people live

00:59.480 --> 01:03.960
there, gets 3 votes to start with before the rest are distributed according to population.

01:03.960 --> 01:07.120
Because of this rule, there are a lot of states with a few people that should only have one

01:07.120 --> 01:10.180
or two votes for president, but instead get 3 or 4.

01:10.180 --> 01:14.040
So Georgians, Virginians, Michiganders, and Jerseyites are each missing one vote.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.900
Pennsylvanians, North Carolinians, Ohioans, and Hoosiers are missing 2, Floridians are

01:17.900 --> 01:23.880
missing 4, New Yorkers 5, Texans 6, and Californians are 10 votes short of what they should get.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.880
Because of this vote redistribution, the Electoral College essentially pretends that

01:26.880 --> 01:30.320
fewer people live where they do and more people live where they don't.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.760
An American who lives in one of these states has their vote for president count for less

01:33.760 --> 01:36.120
than an American who lives in one of these states.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.400
In some cases, the Electoral College bends the results just a little, but if you live

01:39.400 --> 01:42.700
in a particularly large or small state, it bends them a lot.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.840
One Vermonters vote, according to the Electoral College, is worth 3 Texans votes, and one

01:46.840 --> 01:49.700
Wyomingites vote is worth 4 Californians.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.420
Now whoa, hold on there son, you might be saying to yourself right now, you're missing

01:53.460 --> 01:56.900
the whole point of the Electoral College, it's to protect the small states from the

01:56.900 --> 01:57.900
big states.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.100
Give the small states more voting power and the presidential candidates will have to pay

02:01.100 --> 02:03.180
them more attention in an election.

02:03.180 --> 02:06.660
If that's the goal of the Electoral College, it's failing spectacularly.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.700
Here's a graph showing the number of visits the presidential candidates paid to each of

02:09.700 --> 02:12.580
the states in the last two months of the previous election.

02:12.580 --> 02:16.740
If it looks like there are a few states missing, you're right, only 18 of the 50 states received

02:16.740 --> 02:20.860
even a single visit from a candidate, and just two of those states, Maine and New Hampshire,

02:20.860 --> 02:22.780
have very small populations.

02:22.780 --> 02:26.240
The area of the country with the most small states is conspicuously missing.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.140
The Electoral College doesn't make candidates care about small states.

02:30.140 --> 02:34.320
But interestingly, the biggest states, California, Texas and New York, are missing as well.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.680
So what's going on?

02:35.680 --> 02:40.500
Looking closer, just four states, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia, received a majority

02:40.500 --> 02:42.980
of the candidates' attention during the election.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.500
And if you follow the money, it's the same story.

02:45.500 --> 02:49.180
Why do candidates spend so much money and time in so few states?

02:49.180 --> 02:52.220
Because the way the Electoral College works forces them to do so.

02:52.220 --> 02:53.960
The elections are winner-take-all.

02:53.960 --> 02:59.020
As long as a candidate gets just over 50% of the popular vote in a state, he wins 100%

02:59.020 --> 03:00.980
of that state's electoral votes.

03:00.980 --> 03:04.300
That means winning by millions of citizens' votes is no better than winning by a single

03:04.300 --> 03:05.300
vote.

03:05.300 --> 03:08.220
So candidates are safe to ignore states where they poll with big margins.

03:08.220 --> 03:12.060
Instead, the Electoral College makes candidates intensely interested in the needs of just

03:12.060 --> 03:16.140
a few states with close races to the detriment of almost all Americans, which is why it should

03:16.140 --> 03:17.900
be abolished.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.300
But wait, you might say.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.740
Would abolishing the Electoral College and voting directly for president cause candidates

03:22.740 --> 03:24.880
to spend all their time in big cities?

03:24.880 --> 03:27.060
That wouldn't be fair to most Americans either.

03:27.060 --> 03:31.600
This sounds like a reasonable fear, but ignores the mathematical reality of population distribution.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.100
There are 309 million people in the United States, only 8 million of which live in New

03:35.100 --> 03:37.180
York, the largest city by far.

03:37.180 --> 03:39.820
That's 2.6% of the total population.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.300
But after New York, the size of cities drops fast.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.800
LA has 3.8 million people and Chicago has 2.7.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.520
But you can't even make it to the 10th biggest city, San Jose, before you're under a million

03:49.520 --> 03:50.520
people.

03:50.520 --> 03:55.260
These top 10 cities added together are only 7.9% of the popular vote, hardly enough to

03:55.260 --> 03:56.480
win an election.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.520
And even winning the next 90 biggest cities in the United States all the way down to Spokane

04:00.520 --> 04:03.640
is still not yet 20% of the total population.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.080
So unless there's a city with a few hundred million people hiding somewhere in America

04:07.080 --> 04:10.440
that's been left out of the census, the idea that a candidate can just spend their campaign

04:10.440 --> 04:14.960
jetting between New York, LA and Chicago while ignoring everyone else and still become president

04:14.960 --> 04:17.060
is mathematically ludicrous.

04:17.060 --> 04:19.400
Want to see the real way to unfairly win?

04:19.400 --> 04:23.560
How you can become president with only 22% of the popular vote by taking advantage of

04:23.560 --> 04:25.400
the electoral college today.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.560
Don't believe that's possible in a democracy?

04:27.560 --> 04:28.560
Just watch.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.680
Here's the action plan.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.600
Win the votes of the people who count the most and ignore the people who count the least.

04:33.600 --> 04:39.080
Start with Wyoming, the state where 0.18% of Americans live but who get 0.56% of the

04:39.080 --> 04:41.160
electoral college votes for president.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.800
And because it's a winner take all system, you don't need all of them to vote for you,

04:44.800 --> 04:48.440
just half plus one or 0.09%.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.320
Next up is the District of Columbia where winning 0.1% of the population gets you an

04:52.320 --> 04:56.080
additional 0.56% of the electoral college.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.120
Then add in wins in Vermont and North Dakota and Alaska.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.980
Notice how the votes you're getting to win the presidency go up much faster than the

05:01.980 --> 05:06.720
percent of the population who voted for you because of the electoral college's rules.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.640
Next is South Dakota, then Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii,

05:11.640 --> 05:16.960
Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi,

05:16.960 --> 05:21.680
Iowa, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Colorado,

05:21.680 --> 05:24.960
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts,

05:24.960 --> 05:26.400
Virginia and New Jersey.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.680
Congratulations by taking advantage of the unfair rules and winning states, not people,

05:30.680 --> 05:36.160
you've won a majority in the electoral college even though 78% of the population voted against

05:36.160 --> 05:37.160
you.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.360
This is not democracy, this is indefensible.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.020
While this particular scenario is unlikely, if you have a voting system that allows losers

05:44.020 --> 05:46.500
to win you shouldn't be surprised when they do.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.080
Not once, not twice, but thrice in American history the candidate with the most votes

05:50.080 --> 05:53.820
from the people actually lost because of the electoral college.

05:53.820 --> 05:57.540
Three errors in 55 plus elections is a failure rate of 5%.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.200
Would anyone tolerate a sport where, by a quirk of the rules, there was a 5% chance

06:01.200 --> 06:02.600
that the loser would win?

06:02.600 --> 06:03.800
Not likely.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.820
And how much more important electing the President of the United States is, that's a rather

06:06.820 --> 06:10.100
dangerously high percentage of the time to get it wrong.

06:10.100 --> 06:14.040
If we abolish the electoral college and simply let citizens vote for the president directly,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.920
all of these problems will go away and everyone's vote will be equal.
