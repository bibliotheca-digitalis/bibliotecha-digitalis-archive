1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
In a fair democracy, everyone's votes should count equally, but the method that the United

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,840
States uses to elect its president, called the Electoral College, violates this principle

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,280
by making sure that some people's votes are more equal than others.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,360
The Electoral College is, essentially, the 538 votes that determine who wins the presidency.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,040
If these votes were split evenly across the population, every 574,000 people would be

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,900
represented by one vote.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,800
But that's not what happens because the Electoral College doesn't give votes to people, only

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,560
states, which has some unfair consequences.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,820
For example, there are 11.5 million people in Ohio, so, to fairly represent them, it

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,900
should get 20 electoral votes.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,320
But the Electoral College doesn't give Ohio 20 votes, it only gets 18, 2 less than it

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
should.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
Where do those other votes go?

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,920
To states like Rhode Island.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,840
Plucky Rhode Island has 1.1 million people in it, so it should have about 2 votes, but

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,340
instead it gets 4.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,920
Those extra 2 votes that should be representing Ohioans go to representing Rhode Islanders

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
instead.

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Why?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,480
According to the rules of the Electoral College, every state, no matter how few people live

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,960
there, gets 3 votes to start with before the rest are distributed according to population.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,120
Because of this rule, there are a lot of states with a few people that should only have one

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,180
or two votes for president, but instead get 3 or 4.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,040
So Georgians, Virginians, Michiganders, and Jerseyites are each missing one vote.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,900
Pennsylvanians, North Carolinians, Ohioans, and Hoosiers are missing 2, Floridians are

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,880
missing 4, New Yorkers 5, Texans 6, and Californians are 10 votes short of what they should get.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Because of this vote redistribution, the Electoral College essentially pretends that

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
fewer people live where they do and more people live where they don't.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,760
An American who lives in one of these states has their vote for president count for less

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,120
than an American who lives in one of these states.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,400
In some cases, the Electoral College bends the results just a little, but if you live

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,700
in a particularly large or small state, it bends them a lot.

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,840
One Vermonters vote, according to the Electoral College, is worth 3 Texans votes, and one

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,700
Wyomingites vote is worth 4 Californians.

35
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,420
Now whoa, hold on there son, you might be saying to yourself right now, you're missing

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,900
the whole point of the Electoral College, it's to protect the small states from the

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
big states.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,100
Give the small states more voting power and the presidential candidates will have to pay

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,180
them more attention in an election.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,660
If that's the goal of the Electoral College, it's failing spectacularly.

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,700
Here's a graph showing the number of visits the presidential candidates paid to each of

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,580
the states in the last two months of the previous election.

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,740
If it looks like there are a few states missing, you're right, only 18 of the 50 states received

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,860
even a single visit from a candidate, and just two of those states, Maine and New Hampshire,

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,780
have very small populations.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,240
The area of the country with the most small states is conspicuously missing.

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,140
The Electoral College doesn't make candidates care about small states.

48
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,320
But interestingly, the biggest states, California, Texas and New York, are missing as well.

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,680
So what's going on?

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,500
Looking closer, just four states, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia, received a majority

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,980
of the candidates' attention during the election.

52
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,500
And if you follow the money, it's the same story.

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,180
Why do candidates spend so much money and time in so few states?

54
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,220
Because the way the Electoral College works forces them to do so.

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,960
The elections are winner-take-all.

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,020
As long as a candidate gets just over 50% of the popular vote in a state, he wins 100%

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,980
of that state's electoral votes.

58
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,300
That means winning by millions of citizens' votes is no better than winning by a single

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,300
vote.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,220
So candidates are safe to ignore states where they poll with big margins.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,060
Instead, the Electoral College makes candidates intensely interested in the needs of just

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,140
a few states with close races to the detriment of almost all Americans, which is why it should

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,900
be abolished.

64
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,300
But wait, you might say.

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,740
Would abolishing the Electoral College and voting directly for president cause candidates

66
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,880
to spend all their time in big cities?

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,060
That wouldn't be fair to most Americans either.

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,600
This sounds like a reasonable fear, but ignores the mathematical reality of population distribution.

69
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,100
There are 309 million people in the United States, only 8 million of which live in New

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,180
York, the largest city by far.

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,820
That's 2.6% of the total population.

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,300
But after New York, the size of cities drops fast.

73
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,800
LA has 3.8 million people and Chicago has 2.7.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,520
But you can't even make it to the 10th biggest city, San Jose, before you're under a million

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
people.

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,260
These top 10 cities added together are only 7.9% of the popular vote, hardly enough to

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,480
win an election.

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,520
And even winning the next 90 biggest cities in the United States all the way down to Spokane

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,640
is still not yet 20% of the total population.

80
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,080
So unless there's a city with a few hundred million people hiding somewhere in America

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,440
that's been left out of the census, the idea that a candidate can just spend their campaign

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,960
jetting between New York, LA and Chicago while ignoring everyone else and still become president

83
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,060
is mathematically ludicrous.

84
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,400
Want to see the real way to unfairly win?

85
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,560
How you can become president with only 22% of the popular vote by taking advantage of

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,400
the electoral college today.

87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,560
Don't believe that's possible in a democracy?

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Just watch.

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Here's the action plan.

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Win the votes of the people who count the most and ignore the people who count the least.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,080
Start with Wyoming, the state where 0.18% of Americans live but who get 0.56% of the

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,160
electoral college votes for president.

93
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,800
And because it's a winner take all system, you don't need all of them to vote for you,

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,440
just half plus one or 0.09%.

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,320
Next up is the District of Columbia where winning 0.1% of the population gets you an

96
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
additional 0.56% of the electoral college.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,120
Then add in wins in Vermont and North Dakota and Alaska.

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,980
Notice how the votes you're getting to win the presidency go up much faster than the

99
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,720
percent of the population who voted for you because of the electoral college's rules.

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,640
Next is South Dakota, then Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii,

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,960
Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi,

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,680
Iowa, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Colorado,

103
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts,

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
Virginia and New Jersey.

105
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,680
Congratulations by taking advantage of the unfair rules and winning states, not people,

106
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,160
you've won a majority in the electoral college even though 78% of the population voted against

107
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
you.

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,360
This is not democracy, this is indefensible.

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,020
While this particular scenario is unlikely, if you have a voting system that allows losers

110
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,500
to win you shouldn't be surprised when they do.

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,080
Not once, not twice, but thrice in American history the candidate with the most votes

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,820
from the people actually lost because of the electoral college.

113
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,540
Three errors in 55 plus elections is a failure rate of 5%.

114
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,200
Would anyone tolerate a sport where, by a quirk of the rules, there was a 5% chance

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
that the loser would win?

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Not likely.

117
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,820
And how much more important electing the President of the United States is, that's a rather

118
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,100
dangerously high percentage of the time to get it wrong.

119
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,040
If we abolish the electoral college and simply let citizens vote for the president directly,

120
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,920
all of these problems will go away and everyone's vote will be equal.
