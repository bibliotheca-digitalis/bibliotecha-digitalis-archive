1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Pluto, planet or not?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,060
Before we can answer this question we need to know what the word planet is for and that

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,840
takes us back to the ancient Greeks who called Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,480
Moon and the Sun planets.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,920
Basically if it moved across the sky and was bright it was a planet.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,280
This is a terrible start for the word because 1.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,080
It excludes Earth from the list and 2.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,660
It groups wildly different things together.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,680
But the Greeks couldn't know how different the moon was from Saturn because the best

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,120
technology they had to observe the universe was sadly limited.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,400
It would take several thousand years until the industrious Dutch made the first telescopes

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,200
and astronomy became much more interesting.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,440
Astronomers could now confidently rearrange the solar system, an elegant scientific advance

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
that no one could possibly object to, and reclassify its parts dropping the Sun and

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,200
the Moon from the list of planets and adding Earth.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,700
Now if it orbited the Sun it was a planet.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,880
As time went on and telescopes got better and better each new century brought with it

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,600
the discovery of a new planet.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,880
Which brings us to this familiar solar system, 9 planets orbiting one star.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,300
Looking at this model makes people wonder why do astronomers want to ditch Pluto?

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,960
The problem is pictures like this in textbooks are lies.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,080
Well not lies exactly but unhelpful.

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,760
They give the impression that the planets are similar-ish in size and evenly-ish spaced

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,120
but the reality couldn't be more different.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,320
Here dear Terrans is our home planet Earth and this is Jupiter next to it at the correct

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
scale.

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,000
Rather bigger than you probably thought.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,300
If we take this diagram and adjust for the correct sizes of the planets it looks like

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
this.

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,500
If you're watching the video in full screen HD mode you might not be even able to see

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Pluto.

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,980
So size differences are vast and Pluto is the smallest by far.

33
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,780
But it's not just small for a planet it's also smaller than 9 moons.

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,160
Triton, Europa, our own moon, Io, Callisto, Titan and Ganymede.

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,480
Even if you show the correct relative sizes the distances are still a problem.

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,380
Think about it, if Jupiter was this close to Earth it wouldn't look like a dot in the

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,840
night sky but would be rather overwhelming.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,660
So it must be really far away.

39
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,140
Which makes drawing it to scale rather a challenge.

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,120
If you want the length of a piece of paper to represent the distance from Mercury to

41
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Pluto then giant Jupiter would be the size of a dust mite on that page and Pluto a bacterium.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,520
But excluding Pluto from the planet club just for being tiny and small isn't reason enough

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,620
and quickly brings out the Pluto defenders.

44
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,440
In order to understand what Pluto really is we need to first discuss a planet you've never

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
heard of.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Ceres.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Back in 1801 astronomers found a new planet in the huge gap between Mars and Jupiter.

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
It was a small planet but they loved it anyway and named it Ceres.

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,500
And next year astronomers found another small planet in the same area and named it Pallas.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,220
A few years later they found a third one, Juno.

51
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,680
And then funnily enough a fourth one, Vesta.

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,100
And for several decades children learned the 11 planets of the solar system.

53
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,260
But astronomers kept finding more and more of these objects and became increasingly uncomfortable

54
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,180
calling them planets because they were much more like each other than the planets on either

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
side.

56
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,100
So a new category was born, asteroids in the asteroid belt.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,380
And the tiny planets were relabeled which is why you've never heard of them.

58
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,800
And it was a good decision too as astronomers have now found hundreds of thousands of asteroids

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
which would be a lot for a kid to memorize if they were all still planets.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Back to Pluto.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,860
It was discovered in 1930 making it the then 9th planet.

62
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,340
First estimates put Pluto about the size of Neptune but with more observations that was

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,600
revised down and down and down.

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,120
While Pluto shrank astronomers started to find other, similar objects orbiting in the

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
same zone.

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
Sound familiar?

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
While school kids kept memorizing the 9 planets some astronomers grew uneasy about including

68
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,560
Pluto because the size estimates continued to shrink.

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,780
They learned that Pluto is made mostly of ice and they continued to find lots and lots

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,280
of icy objects at the edge of the solar system just like Pluto.

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
This problem could be ignored as long as no one found an ice ball bigger than Pluto.

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
Which is exactly what happened in 2006 with the discovery of Eris.

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,680
Once again astronomers re-categorized the solar system and grouped these distant objects

74
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,400
including Pluto into a new area called the Kuiper belt.

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,820
And that's the story of Pluto, a miscategorized planet that finally found its home.

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,080
Just like Ceres.

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,380
But this story is really less about Pluto than it is about realizing the word planet

78
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,940
isn't very helpful.

79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,440
The first 4 planets are nothing at all like the next 4 so it's even a little weird to

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,420
group these 8 together which is why they often aren't and are separated into terrestrial

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,840
planets and gas giants.

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,060
And now that we have telescopes that can see planets around stars not our own and we've

83
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,200
found rogue planets drifting in empty space and brown dwarfs, objects that blur the very

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,100
line between planet and star, the word planet becomes even less clear.

85
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,740
So as we increase our knowledge of the universe the category of planet will probably continue

86
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,980
to evolve or possibly fall out of favor entirely.

87
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,060
But for the time being the best way to categorize the stuff in our solar system is into one

88
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,560
star, 8 planets, 4 terrestrial, 4 gas giants, the asteroid belt and the distant Kuiper belt

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,540
home to Pluto.
