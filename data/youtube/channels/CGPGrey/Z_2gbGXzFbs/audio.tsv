0	4120	Pluto, planet or not?
4120	7060	Before we can answer this question we need to know what the word planet is for and that
7060	10840	takes us back to the ancient Greeks who called Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the
10840	13480	Moon and the Sun planets.
13480	16920	Basically if it moved across the sky and was bright it was a planet.
16920	19280	This is a terrible start for the word because 1.
19280	21080	It excludes Earth from the list and 2.
21080	23660	It groups wildly different things together.
23660	26680	But the Greeks couldn't know how different the moon was from Saturn because the best
26680	30120	technology they had to observe the universe was sadly limited.
30120	33400	It would take several thousand years until the industrious Dutch made the first telescopes
33400	36200	and astronomy became much more interesting.
36200	39440	Astronomers could now confidently rearrange the solar system, an elegant scientific advance
39440	43600	that no one could possibly object to, and reclassify its parts dropping the Sun and
43600	46200	the Moon from the list of planets and adding Earth.
46200	48700	Now if it orbited the Sun it was a planet.
48700	51880	As time went on and telescopes got better and better each new century brought with it
51880	53600	the discovery of a new planet.
53600	57880	Which brings us to this familiar solar system, 9 planets orbiting one star.
57880	61300	Looking at this model makes people wonder why do astronomers want to ditch Pluto?
61300	63960	The problem is pictures like this in textbooks are lies.
63960	66080	Well not lies exactly but unhelpful.
66080	69760	They give the impression that the planets are similar-ish in size and evenly-ish spaced
69760	72120	but the reality couldn't be more different.
72120	76320	Here dear Terrans is our home planet Earth and this is Jupiter next to it at the correct
76320	77320	scale.
77320	79000	Rather bigger than you probably thought.
79000	82300	If we take this diagram and adjust for the correct sizes of the planets it looks like
82300	83300	this.
83340	86500	If you're watching the video in full screen HD mode you might not be even able to see
86500	87500	Pluto.
87500	90980	So size differences are vast and Pluto is the smallest by far.
90980	94780	But it's not just small for a planet it's also smaller than 9 moons.
94780	98160	Triton, Europa, our own moon, Io, Callisto, Titan and Ganymede.
98160	101480	Even if you show the correct relative sizes the distances are still a problem.
101480	104380	Think about it, if Jupiter was this close to Earth it wouldn't look like a dot in the
104380	106840	night sky but would be rather overwhelming.
106840	108660	So it must be really far away.
108660	111140	Which makes drawing it to scale rather a challenge.
111140	114120	If you want the length of a piece of paper to represent the distance from Mercury to
114120	119560	Pluto then giant Jupiter would be the size of a dust mite on that page and Pluto a bacterium.
119560	123520	But excluding Pluto from the planet club just for being tiny and small isn't reason enough
123520	125620	and quickly brings out the Pluto defenders.
125620	129440	In order to understand what Pluto really is we need to first discuss a planet you've never
129440	130440	heard of.
130440	131440	Ceres.
131440	135440	Back in 1801 astronomers found a new planet in the huge gap between Mars and Jupiter.
135440	138560	It was a small planet but they loved it anyway and named it Ceres.
138560	142500	And next year astronomers found another small planet in the same area and named it Pallas.
142500	145220	A few years later they found a third one, Juno.
145220	147680	And then funnily enough a fourth one, Vesta.
147680	151100	And for several decades children learned the 11 planets of the solar system.
151100	155260	But astronomers kept finding more and more of these objects and became increasingly uncomfortable
155260	159180	calling them planets because they were much more like each other than the planets on either
159180	160180	side.
160180	163100	So a new category was born, asteroids in the asteroid belt.
163100	166380	And the tiny planets were relabeled which is why you've never heard of them.
166380	170800	And it was a good decision too as astronomers have now found hundreds of thousands of asteroids
170800	174800	which would be a lot for a kid to memorize if they were all still planets.
174800	175800	Back to Pluto.
175800	178860	It was discovered in 1930 making it the then 9th planet.
178860	182340	First estimates put Pluto about the size of Neptune but with more observations that was
182340	185600	revised down and down and down.
185600	189120	While Pluto shrank astronomers started to find other, similar objects orbiting in the
189120	190120	same zone.
190120	191280	Sound familiar?
191280	195040	While school kids kept memorizing the 9 planets some astronomers grew uneasy about including
195040	197560	Pluto because the size estimates continued to shrink.
197560	201780	They learned that Pluto is made mostly of ice and they continued to find lots and lots
201780	205280	of icy objects at the edge of the solar system just like Pluto.
205280	209360	This problem could be ignored as long as no one found an ice ball bigger than Pluto.
209360	213120	Which is exactly what happened in 2006 with the discovery of Eris.
213120	216680	Once again astronomers re-categorized the solar system and grouped these distant objects
216680	220400	including Pluto into a new area called the Kuiper belt.
220400	224820	And that's the story of Pluto, a miscategorized planet that finally found its home.
224820	226080	Just like Ceres.
226080	229380	But this story is really less about Pluto than it is about realizing the word planet
229380	230940	isn't very helpful.
230940	234440	The first 4 planets are nothing at all like the next 4 so it's even a little weird to
234440	238420	group these 8 together which is why they often aren't and are separated into terrestrial
238420	239840	planets and gas giants.
239840	243060	And now that we have telescopes that can see planets around stars not our own and we've
243060	247200	found rogue planets drifting in empty space and brown dwarfs, objects that blur the very
247200	251100	line between planet and star, the word planet becomes even less clear.
251100	254740	So as we increase our knowledge of the universe the category of planet will probably continue
254740	257980	to evolve or possibly fall out of favor entirely.
257980	262060	But for the time being the best way to categorize the stuff in our solar system is into one
262060	267560	star, 8 planets, 4 terrestrial, 4 gas giants, the asteroid belt and the distant Kuiper belt
267560	268540	home to Pluto.
