00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
Pluto, planet or not?

00:04.120 --> 00:07.060
Before we can answer this question we need to know what the word planet is for and that

00:07.060 --> 00:10.840
takes us back to the ancient Greeks who called Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the

00:10.840 --> 00:13.480
Moon and the Sun planets.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.920
Basically if it moved across the sky and was bright it was a planet.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.280
This is a terrible start for the word because 1.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.080
It excludes Earth from the list and 2.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.660
It groups wildly different things together.

00:23.660 --> 00:26.680
But the Greeks couldn't know how different the moon was from Saturn because the best

00:26.680 --> 00:30.120
technology they had to observe the universe was sadly limited.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.400
It would take several thousand years until the industrious Dutch made the first telescopes

00:33.400 --> 00:36.200
and astronomy became much more interesting.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.440
Astronomers could now confidently rearrange the solar system, an elegant scientific advance

00:39.440 --> 00:43.600
that no one could possibly object to, and reclassify its parts dropping the Sun and

00:43.600 --> 00:46.200
the Moon from the list of planets and adding Earth.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.700
Now if it orbited the Sun it was a planet.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.880
As time went on and telescopes got better and better each new century brought with it

00:51.880 --> 00:53.600
the discovery of a new planet.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.880
Which brings us to this familiar solar system, 9 planets orbiting one star.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.300
Looking at this model makes people wonder why do astronomers want to ditch Pluto?

01:01.300 --> 01:03.960
The problem is pictures like this in textbooks are lies.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.080
Well not lies exactly but unhelpful.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.760
They give the impression that the planets are similar-ish in size and evenly-ish spaced

01:09.760 --> 01:12.120
but the reality couldn't be more different.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.320
Here dear Terrans is our home planet Earth and this is Jupiter next to it at the correct

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
scale.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.000
Rather bigger than you probably thought.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.300
If we take this diagram and adjust for the correct sizes of the planets it looks like

01:22.300 --> 01:23.300
this.

01:23.340 --> 01:26.500
If you're watching the video in full screen HD mode you might not be even able to see

01:26.500 --> 01:27.500
Pluto.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.980
So size differences are vast and Pluto is the smallest by far.

01:30.980 --> 01:34.780
But it's not just small for a planet it's also smaller than 9 moons.

01:34.780 --> 01:38.160
Triton, Europa, our own moon, Io, Callisto, Titan and Ganymede.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.480
Even if you show the correct relative sizes the distances are still a problem.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.380
Think about it, if Jupiter was this close to Earth it wouldn't look like a dot in the

01:44.380 --> 01:46.840
night sky but would be rather overwhelming.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.660
So it must be really far away.

01:48.660 --> 01:51.140
Which makes drawing it to scale rather a challenge.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.120
If you want the length of a piece of paper to represent the distance from Mercury to

01:54.120 --> 01:59.560
Pluto then giant Jupiter would be the size of a dust mite on that page and Pluto a bacterium.

01:59.560 --> 02:03.520
But excluding Pluto from the planet club just for being tiny and small isn't reason enough

02:03.520 --> 02:05.620
and quickly brings out the Pluto defenders.

02:05.620 --> 02:09.440
In order to understand what Pluto really is we need to first discuss a planet you've never

02:09.440 --> 02:10.440
heard of.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.440
Ceres.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.440
Back in 1801 astronomers found a new planet in the huge gap between Mars and Jupiter.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.560
It was a small planet but they loved it anyway and named it Ceres.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.500
And next year astronomers found another small planet in the same area and named it Pallas.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.220
A few years later they found a third one, Juno.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.680
And then funnily enough a fourth one, Vesta.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.100
And for several decades children learned the 11 planets of the solar system.

02:31.100 --> 02:35.260
But astronomers kept finding more and more of these objects and became increasingly uncomfortable

02:35.260 --> 02:39.180
calling them planets because they were much more like each other than the planets on either

02:39.180 --> 02:40.180
side.

02:40.180 --> 02:43.100
So a new category was born, asteroids in the asteroid belt.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.380
And the tiny planets were relabeled which is why you've never heard of them.

02:46.380 --> 02:50.800
And it was a good decision too as astronomers have now found hundreds of thousands of asteroids

02:50.800 --> 02:54.800
which would be a lot for a kid to memorize if they were all still planets.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
Back to Pluto.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.860
It was discovered in 1930 making it the then 9th planet.

02:58.860 --> 03:02.340
First estimates put Pluto about the size of Neptune but with more observations that was

03:02.340 --> 03:05.600
revised down and down and down.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.120
While Pluto shrank astronomers started to find other, similar objects orbiting in the

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
same zone.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.280
Sound familiar?

03:11.280 --> 03:15.040
While school kids kept memorizing the 9 planets some astronomers grew uneasy about including

03:15.040 --> 03:17.560
Pluto because the size estimates continued to shrink.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.780
They learned that Pluto is made mostly of ice and they continued to find lots and lots

03:21.780 --> 03:25.280
of icy objects at the edge of the solar system just like Pluto.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.360
This problem could be ignored as long as no one found an ice ball bigger than Pluto.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.120
Which is exactly what happened in 2006 with the discovery of Eris.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.680
Once again astronomers re-categorized the solar system and grouped these distant objects

03:36.680 --> 03:40.400
including Pluto into a new area called the Kuiper belt.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.820
And that's the story of Pluto, a miscategorized planet that finally found its home.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.080
Just like Ceres.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.380
But this story is really less about Pluto than it is about realizing the word planet

03:49.380 --> 03:50.940
isn't very helpful.

03:50.940 --> 03:54.440
The first 4 planets are nothing at all like the next 4 so it's even a little weird to

03:54.440 --> 03:58.420
group these 8 together which is why they often aren't and are separated into terrestrial

03:58.420 --> 03:59.840
planets and gas giants.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.060
And now that we have telescopes that can see planets around stars not our own and we've

04:03.060 --> 04:07.200
found rogue planets drifting in empty space and brown dwarfs, objects that blur the very

04:07.200 --> 04:11.100
line between planet and star, the word planet becomes even less clear.

04:11.100 --> 04:14.740
So as we increase our knowledge of the universe the category of planet will probably continue

04:14.740 --> 04:17.980
to evolve or possibly fall out of favor entirely.

04:17.980 --> 04:22.060
But for the time being the best way to categorize the stuff in our solar system is into one

04:22.060 --> 04:27.560
star, 8 planets, 4 terrestrial, 4 gas giants, the asteroid belt and the distant Kuiper belt

04:27.560 --> 04:28.540
home to Pluto.
