0	2700	Hello, Internet. It's Q&A time. First question.
2700	4260	Are memes the future of society?
4260	7000	I think you meant this as a joke, but the answer is yes.
7000	11220	The Internet for memes is the perfect petri dish, gladiatorial theater, and mutation chamber,
11220	14960	growing, selecting, and randomizing the memest memes to meme in our minds.
14960	19360	Society has always been a war of memes, but before it was fought with sticks and stones.
19360	25600	The Internet, however, has arms-raced that fight to trench warfare of meme-driven brains in many areas.
25600	30560	They've not yet captured all fields of thought, but I fear the meme trenches will only expand.
30560	33680	In a previous Q&A, I was asked what topic I've changed my mind on,
33680	37900	and the unmitigated benefits of the Internet sure is one of those things.
37900	40700	Right from top to bottom. Pancakes, waffles, French toast.
40700	45620	If you know you're at a great restaurant, then the ordering hierarchy is French toast before waffles before pancakes.
45620	49040	If you're at a restaurant of unknown quality, the hierarchy reverses.
49040	55380	Pancakes are more reliably consistent, and thus can't reach the repulsive troughs or sublime peaks of French toast.
55380	57620	What makes you unique compared to seven billion people on Earth?
57620	59860	In a world of billions, no one is unique.
59860	63020	If you could have a companion animal like the golden compass, what would you have?
63020	66940	A chimpanzee demon. Maximize utility while minimizing inconvenience.
66940	68780	What common life advice do you disagree with?
68780	72020	Do what you love. And her sister meme, follow your passion.
72020	77620	The word passion here is a disgusting perversion of language if, you know, words mean things.
77620	81580	And yes, there are people who are passionate, gross, about their work, but guess what?
81620	83940	Those kinds of people don't need advice.
83940	87780	They're going to do whatever they're, uh, passionate about anyway.
87780	93220	So this advice is useless to those who are its exemplars while being anti-useful to everyone else,
93220	99100	making most people feel bad about their lives and their work by setting an impossibly high bar.
99100	104300	In life, rather than expecting to find a burning passion inside yourself that you somehow don't know about already,
104300	108100	because it doesn't exist, it's better and more useful to think of life like fishing.
108100	113020	Some spots are beautiful to you, and in some spots your skills will catch fish, others not.
113020	116300	But you can't know where you'd like to spend time until you go there,
116300	119700	and you can't know how many fish you can catch there until you try.
119700	122860	The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots,
122860	126940	and then the older you are, the more time you get to spend in places you know you like,
126940	129340	refining your abilities to catch fish there.
129340	132100	Did you have a point in life that turned you around productivity-wise?
132100	134820	If so, what changed, and what contributed to that change?
134820	136540	Yes, there was a time and an event.
136540	138780	I drifted through school without learning how to be organized,
138780	142140	because despite what schools tell you about preparing you for the real world,
142140	147300	they're mostly a babysitting service obsessed with an endless game of trivial pursuit.
147300	153060	When school dumped me into the real world, I had no idea how to adult, and needed to figure it out fast.
153060	156260	The single thing that changed me the most was keeping a paper notebook in my pocket
156260	160980	and writing down my thoughts and simply looking back at that notebook on a regular basis.
160980	163180	That loop booted me into a real human.
163180	168940	It's so simple, but it comes down to increasing communication between the past, present, and future you.
168940	172140	That's how you direct change in yourself over time.
172140	176220	What motivates you to do anything productive when everything is meaningless anyway?
176220	180180	This if-we-all-die-what's-the-point meme is a bad one for brains.
180180	186140	Like, it's true that in the long run we are all not but dust, forgotten, forever.
186140	190300	But your present experiences are real, and they're all you'll ever have.
190300	194540	A sunset doesn't need meaning to be enjoyed. The enjoyment is the meaning.
194540	199140	Using productivity to build a life you want to live is intrinsically meaningful,
199140	202260	despite Abyss swallowing us all in the end.
202260	207380	If you're not in a good place, there's lots of small stuff you can do to start turning that around.
207380	209180	Watch this do the opposite.
209180	211940	What would you do if you became immortal? I'd live a really long time.
211940	214860	On a Dungeons & Dragons alignment chart, where would you place yourself?
214860	216700	Oh, D&D alignment charts.
216700	219820	It's so fun because of the endless disagreements over what the words
219820	222380	Lawful, Chaotic, Good, Evil, and Neutral mean.
222380	225740	You think it's obvious, but so does the guy you're arguing with.
225740	229340	People might think I'm over here, but I might view myself as over here,
229340	234380	or depending on how much you want to D&D rules lawyer the word chaos, maybe even over here.
234380	238940	But the question ultimately presupposes the lie that people are consistent selves,
238940	241660	and in reality, ourselves are situational,
241660	246060	and everyone is everything for a time or under the right circumstances.
246060	250060	But that's no fun. It's easier and memesier to put people on a 2D grid,
250060	253180	and I've yet to see a D&D alignment chart for YouTube.
253180	257660	Who among tubers is our Lawful Good, and who is our Chaotic Evil?
257660	260860	On the Reddit, I look forward to seeing your 2D D&D interpretations
260860	263020	of the multifaceted people on this site.
263020	265820	You are allowed to change the name of the seventh planet in our solar system.
265820	266620	What would you call it?
266620	269420	King George, of course. I'm still serious about this meme.
269420	270940	Hashtag seventh planet King George.
270940	274620	If you could remove a single trait or characteristic from human beings as a species,
274620	276300	what would it be and why?
276300	278780	Human tribalism is a double-edged sword.
278780	284060	There were 14,000 questions submitted to this Q&A on my The Reddit,
284060	287740	and it's astounding to see how many are really asking,
287740	289740	are you part of my tribe or not?
289740	292940	And it's disappointing to see how badly people react
292940	296860	when the answer is no, even on the most trivial of things.
296860	299580	However, tribalism is how we develop teamwork,
299580	302060	and teamwork is how we build civilizations.
302060	307580	But tribes are so often motivated by the totem they construct of the other tribe to yell at.
307580	310940	So if tribalism and the teamwork it creates could still exist
310940	314940	when removing the tendency to build totems to burn in effigy, I'd do that.
314940	316780	Can you wear a hat for the rest of the video?
316780	317580	Uh, okay.
317580	319740	What's your opinion on whether Balrogs have wings?
319740	323100	Ah, the great Balrog debate of 2000 lives on.
323100	325900	There's a good reason my Balrog is drawn the way it is.
325900	327420	The line from Fellowship reads,
327420	329820	Gandalf's enemy halted again, facing him,
329820	333580	and the shadow about the Balrog reached out like two vast wings.
333580	334860	Unambiguous.
334860	337260	A shadow that's like wings isn't wings.
337260	338940	They're metaphorical wings.
338940	342060	Yet not two paragraphs later, Tolkien writes,
342060	344380	the Balrog drew itself up to a great height,
344380	347020	and its wings were spread from wall to wall.
347020	348780	Unambiguous wings.
348780	350140	Or maybe not.
350140	354220	Are these wings the metaphorical wings from but 12 sentences earlier?
354220	358220	Well, now this has become an argument about how big the room is
358220	362060	that these real or metaphorical wings must stretch across.
362060	363980	Asking, did the Balrog have wings?
363980	365980	The books have the same answer as,
365980	368380	hey, where did the orcs come from?
368380	369820	Day month year or month day year?
369820	370620	Year month day.
370620	371980	What are your thoughts on thoughts?
371980	373420	Who knows where thoughts come from?
373420	374220	They just appear.
374220	376060	Is the glass half full or half empty?
376060	377260	Why must judgment be passed?
377260	378540	The glass is this full.
378540	379900	How would you rule the world?
379900	382460	With compassion and an iron fist.
382460	383340	Am I first?
383340	385740	No, you were exactly 10,044th.
