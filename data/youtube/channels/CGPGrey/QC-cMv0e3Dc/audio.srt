00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello, Internet. It's Q&A time. First question.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,260
Are memes the future of society?

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,000
I think you meant this as a joke, but the answer is yes.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,220
The Internet for memes is the perfect petri dish, gladiatorial theater, and mutation chamber,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,960
growing, selecting, and randomizing the memest memes to meme in our minds.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,360
Society has always been a war of memes, but before it was fought with sticks and stones.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,600
The Internet, however, has arms-raced that fight to trench warfare of meme-driven brains in many areas.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,560
They've not yet captured all fields of thought, but I fear the meme trenches will only expand.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
In a previous Q&A, I was asked what topic I've changed my mind on,

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,900
and the unmitigated benefits of the Internet sure is one of those things.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,700
Right from top to bottom. Pancakes, waffles, French toast.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,620
If you know you're at a great restaurant, then the ordering hierarchy is French toast before waffles before pancakes.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,040
If you're at a restaurant of unknown quality, the hierarchy reverses.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,380
Pancakes are more reliably consistent, and thus can't reach the repulsive troughs or sublime peaks of French toast.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,620
What makes you unique compared to seven billion people on Earth?

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,860
In a world of billions, no one is unique.

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,020
If you could have a companion animal like the golden compass, what would you have?

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,940
A chimpanzee demon. Maximize utility while minimizing inconvenience.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,780
What common life advice do you disagree with?

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,020
Do what you love. And her sister meme, follow your passion.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,620
The word passion here is a disgusting perversion of language if, you know, words mean things.

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,580
And yes, there are people who are passionate, gross, about their work, but guess what?

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,940
Those kinds of people don't need advice.

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,780
They're going to do whatever they're, uh, passionate about anyway.

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,220
So this advice is useless to those who are its exemplars while being anti-useful to everyone else,

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,100
making most people feel bad about their lives and their work by setting an impossibly high bar.

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,300
In life, rather than expecting to find a burning passion inside yourself that you somehow don't know about already,

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,100
because it doesn't exist, it's better and more useful to think of life like fishing.

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,020
Some spots are beautiful to you, and in some spots your skills will catch fish, others not.

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,300
But you can't know where you'd like to spend time until you go there,

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,700
and you can't know how many fish you can catch there until you try.

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,860
The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots,

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,940
and then the older you are, the more time you get to spend in places you know you like,

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,340
refining your abilities to catch fish there.

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,100
Did you have a point in life that turned you around productivity-wise?

36
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,820
If so, what changed, and what contributed to that change?

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,540
Yes, there was a time and an event.

38
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,780
I drifted through school without learning how to be organized,

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,140
because despite what schools tell you about preparing you for the real world,

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,300
they're mostly a babysitting service obsessed with an endless game of trivial pursuit.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,060
When school dumped me into the real world, I had no idea how to adult, and needed to figure it out fast.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,260
The single thing that changed me the most was keeping a paper notebook in my pocket

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,980
and writing down my thoughts and simply looking back at that notebook on a regular basis.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,180
That loop booted me into a real human.

45
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,940
It's so simple, but it comes down to increasing communication between the past, present, and future you.

46
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,140
That's how you direct change in yourself over time.

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,220
What motivates you to do anything productive when everything is meaningless anyway?

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,180
This if-we-all-die-what's-the-point meme is a bad one for brains.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,140
Like, it's true that in the long run we are all not but dust, forgotten, forever.

50
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,300
But your present experiences are real, and they're all you'll ever have.

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,540
A sunset doesn't need meaning to be enjoyed. The enjoyment is the meaning.

52
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,140
Using productivity to build a life you want to live is intrinsically meaningful,

53
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,260
despite Abyss swallowing us all in the end.

54
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,380
If you're not in a good place, there's lots of small stuff you can do to start turning that around.

55
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,180
Watch this do the opposite.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,940
What would you do if you became immortal? I'd live a really long time.

57
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,860
On a Dungeons & Dragons alignment chart, where would you place yourself?

58
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,700
Oh, D&D alignment charts.

59
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,820
It's so fun because of the endless disagreements over what the words

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,380
Lawful, Chaotic, Good, Evil, and Neutral mean.

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,740
You think it's obvious, but so does the guy you're arguing with.

62
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,340
People might think I'm over here, but I might view myself as over here,

63
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,380
or depending on how much you want to D&D rules lawyer the word chaos, maybe even over here.

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,940
But the question ultimately presupposes the lie that people are consistent selves,

65
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,660
and in reality, ourselves are situational,

66
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,060
and everyone is everything for a time or under the right circumstances.

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,060
But that's no fun. It's easier and memesier to put people on a 2D grid,

68
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,180
and I've yet to see a D&D alignment chart for YouTube.

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,660
Who among tubers is our Lawful Good, and who is our Chaotic Evil?

70
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,860
On the Reddit, I look forward to seeing your 2D D&D interpretations

71
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,020
of the multifaceted people on this site.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,820
You are allowed to change the name of the seventh planet in our solar system.

73
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,620
What would you call it?

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,420
King George, of course. I'm still serious about this meme.

75
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,940
Hashtag seventh planet King George.

76
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,620
If you could remove a single trait or characteristic from human beings as a species,

77
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,300
what would it be and why?

78
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,780
Human tribalism is a double-edged sword.

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,060
There were 14,000 questions submitted to this Q&A on my The Reddit,

80
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,740
and it's astounding to see how many are really asking,

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
are you part of my tribe or not?

82
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,940
And it's disappointing to see how badly people react

83
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,860
when the answer is no, even on the most trivial of things.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,580
However, tribalism is how we develop teamwork,

85
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,060
and teamwork is how we build civilizations.

86
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,580
But tribes are so often motivated by the totem they construct of the other tribe to yell at.

87
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,940
So if tribalism and the teamwork it creates could still exist

88
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,940
when removing the tendency to build totems to burn in effigy, I'd do that.

89
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,780
Can you wear a hat for the rest of the video?

90
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,580
Uh, okay.

91
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,740
What's your opinion on whether Balrogs have wings?

92
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,100
Ah, the great Balrog debate of 2000 lives on.

93
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,900
There's a good reason my Balrog is drawn the way it is.

94
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,420
The line from Fellowship reads,

95
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,820
Gandalf's enemy halted again, facing him,

96
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,580
and the shadow about the Balrog reached out like two vast wings.

97
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,860
Unambiguous.

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,260
A shadow that's like wings isn't wings.

99
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,940
They're metaphorical wings.

100
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,060
Yet not two paragraphs later, Tolkien writes,

101
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,380
the Balrog drew itself up to a great height,

102
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,020
and its wings were spread from wall to wall.

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,780
Unambiguous wings.

104
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,140
Or maybe not.

105
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,220
Are these wings the metaphorical wings from but 12 sentences earlier?

106
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Well, now this has become an argument about how big the room is

107
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,060
that these real or metaphorical wings must stretch across.

108
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,980
Asking, did the Balrog have wings?

109
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,980
The books have the same answer as,

110
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,380
hey, where did the orcs come from?

111
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,820
Day month year or month day year?

112
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,620
Year month day.

113
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,980
What are your thoughts on thoughts?

114
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,420
Who knows where thoughts come from?

115
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,220
They just appear.

116
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,060
Is the glass half full or half empty?

117
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,260
Why must judgment be passed?

118
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,540
The glass is this full.

119
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,900
How would you rule the world?

120
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,460
With compassion and an iron fist.

121
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,340
Am I first?

122
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,740
No, you were exactly 10,044th.
