00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Hello, Internet. It's Q&A time. First question.

00:02.700 --> 00:04.260
Are memes the future of society?

00:04.260 --> 00:07.000
I think you meant this as a joke, but the answer is yes.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.220
The Internet for memes is the perfect petri dish, gladiatorial theater, and mutation chamber,

00:11.220 --> 00:14.960
growing, selecting, and randomizing the memest memes to meme in our minds.

00:14.960 --> 00:19.360
Society has always been a war of memes, but before it was fought with sticks and stones.

00:19.360 --> 00:25.600
The Internet, however, has arms-raced that fight to trench warfare of meme-driven brains in many areas.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.560
They've not yet captured all fields of thought, but I fear the meme trenches will only expand.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.680
In a previous Q&A, I was asked what topic I've changed my mind on,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.900
and the unmitigated benefits of the Internet sure is one of those things.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.700
Right from top to bottom. Pancakes, waffles, French toast.

00:40.700 --> 00:45.620
If you know you're at a great restaurant, then the ordering hierarchy is French toast before waffles before pancakes.

00:45.620 --> 00:49.040
If you're at a restaurant of unknown quality, the hierarchy reverses.

00:49.040 --> 00:55.380
Pancakes are more reliably consistent, and thus can't reach the repulsive troughs or sublime peaks of French toast.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.620
What makes you unique compared to seven billion people on Earth?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.860
In a world of billions, no one is unique.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.020
If you could have a companion animal like the golden compass, what would you have?

01:03.020 --> 01:06.940
A chimpanzee demon. Maximize utility while minimizing inconvenience.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.780
What common life advice do you disagree with?

01:08.780 --> 01:12.020
Do what you love. And her sister meme, follow your passion.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.620
The word passion here is a disgusting perversion of language if, you know, words mean things.

01:17.620 --> 01:21.580
And yes, there are people who are passionate, gross, about their work, but guess what?

01:21.620 --> 01:23.940
Those kinds of people don't need advice.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.780
They're going to do whatever they're, uh, passionate about anyway.

01:27.780 --> 01:33.220
So this advice is useless to those who are its exemplars while being anti-useful to everyone else,

01:33.220 --> 01:39.100
making most people feel bad about their lives and their work by setting an impossibly high bar.

01:39.100 --> 01:44.300
In life, rather than expecting to find a burning passion inside yourself that you somehow don't know about already,

01:44.300 --> 01:48.100
because it doesn't exist, it's better and more useful to think of life like fishing.

01:48.100 --> 01:53.020
Some spots are beautiful to you, and in some spots your skills will catch fish, others not.

01:53.020 --> 01:56.300
But you can't know where you'd like to spend time until you go there,

01:56.300 --> 01:59.700
and you can't know how many fish you can catch there until you try.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.860
The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots,

02:02.860 --> 02:06.940
and then the older you are, the more time you get to spend in places you know you like,

02:06.940 --> 02:09.340
refining your abilities to catch fish there.

02:09.340 --> 02:12.100
Did you have a point in life that turned you around productivity-wise?

02:12.100 --> 02:14.820
If so, what changed, and what contributed to that change?

02:14.820 --> 02:16.540
Yes, there was a time and an event.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.780
I drifted through school without learning how to be organized,

02:18.780 --> 02:22.140
because despite what schools tell you about preparing you for the real world,

02:22.140 --> 02:27.300
they're mostly a babysitting service obsessed with an endless game of trivial pursuit.

02:27.300 --> 02:33.060
When school dumped me into the real world, I had no idea how to adult, and needed to figure it out fast.

02:33.060 --> 02:36.260
The single thing that changed me the most was keeping a paper notebook in my pocket

02:36.260 --> 02:40.980
and writing down my thoughts and simply looking back at that notebook on a regular basis.

02:40.980 --> 02:43.180
That loop booted me into a real human.

02:43.180 --> 02:48.940
It's so simple, but it comes down to increasing communication between the past, present, and future you.

02:48.940 --> 02:52.140
That's how you direct change in yourself over time.

02:52.140 --> 02:56.220
What motivates you to do anything productive when everything is meaningless anyway?

02:56.220 --> 03:00.180
This if-we-all-die-what's-the-point meme is a bad one for brains.

03:00.180 --> 03:06.140
Like, it's true that in the long run we are all not but dust, forgotten, forever.

03:06.140 --> 03:10.300
But your present experiences are real, and they're all you'll ever have.

03:10.300 --> 03:14.540
A sunset doesn't need meaning to be enjoyed. The enjoyment is the meaning.

03:14.540 --> 03:19.140
Using productivity to build a life you want to live is intrinsically meaningful,

03:19.140 --> 03:22.260
despite Abyss swallowing us all in the end.

03:22.260 --> 03:27.380
If you're not in a good place, there's lots of small stuff you can do to start turning that around.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.180
Watch this do the opposite.

03:29.180 --> 03:31.940
What would you do if you became immortal? I'd live a really long time.

03:31.940 --> 03:34.860
On a Dungeons & Dragons alignment chart, where would you place yourself?

03:34.860 --> 03:36.700
Oh, D&D alignment charts.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.820
It's so fun because of the endless disagreements over what the words

03:39.820 --> 03:42.380
Lawful, Chaotic, Good, Evil, and Neutral mean.

03:42.380 --> 03:45.740
You think it's obvious, but so does the guy you're arguing with.

03:45.740 --> 03:49.340
People might think I'm over here, but I might view myself as over here,

03:49.340 --> 03:54.380
or depending on how much you want to D&D rules lawyer the word chaos, maybe even over here.

03:54.380 --> 03:58.940
But the question ultimately presupposes the lie that people are consistent selves,

03:58.940 --> 04:01.660
and in reality, ourselves are situational,

04:01.660 --> 04:06.060
and everyone is everything for a time or under the right circumstances.

04:06.060 --> 04:10.060
But that's no fun. It's easier and memesier to put people on a 2D grid,

04:10.060 --> 04:13.180
and I've yet to see a D&D alignment chart for YouTube.

04:13.180 --> 04:17.660
Who among tubers is our Lawful Good, and who is our Chaotic Evil?

04:17.660 --> 04:20.860
On the Reddit, I look forward to seeing your 2D D&D interpretations

04:20.860 --> 04:23.020
of the multifaceted people on this site.

04:23.020 --> 04:25.820
You are allowed to change the name of the seventh planet in our solar system.

04:25.820 --> 04:26.620
What would you call it?

04:26.620 --> 04:29.420
King George, of course. I'm still serious about this meme.

04:29.420 --> 04:30.940
Hashtag seventh planet King George.

04:30.940 --> 04:34.620
If you could remove a single trait or characteristic from human beings as a species,

04:34.620 --> 04:36.300
what would it be and why?

04:36.300 --> 04:38.780
Human tribalism is a double-edged sword.

04:38.780 --> 04:44.060
There were 14,000 questions submitted to this Q&A on my The Reddit,

04:44.060 --> 04:47.740
and it's astounding to see how many are really asking,

04:47.740 --> 04:49.740
are you part of my tribe or not?

04:49.740 --> 04:52.940
And it's disappointing to see how badly people react

04:52.940 --> 04:56.860
when the answer is no, even on the most trivial of things.

04:56.860 --> 04:59.580
However, tribalism is how we develop teamwork,

04:59.580 --> 05:02.060
and teamwork is how we build civilizations.

05:02.060 --> 05:07.580
But tribes are so often motivated by the totem they construct of the other tribe to yell at.

05:07.580 --> 05:10.940
So if tribalism and the teamwork it creates could still exist

05:10.940 --> 05:14.940
when removing the tendency to build totems to burn in effigy, I'd do that.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.780
Can you wear a hat for the rest of the video?

05:16.780 --> 05:17.580
Uh, okay.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.740
What's your opinion on whether Balrogs have wings?

05:19.740 --> 05:23.100
Ah, the great Balrog debate of 2000 lives on.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.900
There's a good reason my Balrog is drawn the way it is.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.420
The line from Fellowship reads,

05:27.420 --> 05:29.820
Gandalf's enemy halted again, facing him,

05:29.820 --> 05:33.580
and the shadow about the Balrog reached out like two vast wings.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.860
Unambiguous.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.260
A shadow that's like wings isn't wings.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.940
They're metaphorical wings.

05:38.940 --> 05:42.060
Yet not two paragraphs later, Tolkien writes,

05:42.060 --> 05:44.380
the Balrog drew itself up to a great height,

05:44.380 --> 05:47.020
and its wings were spread from wall to wall.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.780
Unambiguous wings.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.140
Or maybe not.

05:50.140 --> 05:54.220
Are these wings the metaphorical wings from but 12 sentences earlier?

05:54.220 --> 05:58.220
Well, now this has become an argument about how big the room is

05:58.220 --> 06:02.060
that these real or metaphorical wings must stretch across.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.980
Asking, did the Balrog have wings?

06:03.980 --> 06:05.980
The books have the same answer as,

06:05.980 --> 06:08.380
hey, where did the orcs come from?

06:08.380 --> 06:09.820
Day month year or month day year?

06:09.820 --> 06:10.620
Year month day.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.980
What are your thoughts on thoughts?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.420
Who knows where thoughts come from?

06:13.420 --> 06:14.220
They just appear.

06:14.220 --> 06:16.060
Is the glass half full or half empty?

06:16.060 --> 06:17.260
Why must judgment be passed?

06:17.260 --> 06:18.540
The glass is this full.

06:18.540 --> 06:19.900
How would you rule the world?

06:19.900 --> 06:22.460
With compassion and an iron fist.

06:22.460 --> 06:23.340
Am I first?

06:23.340 --> 06:25.740
No, you were exactly 10,044th.
