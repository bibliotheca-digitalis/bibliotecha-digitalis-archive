1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
The Electoral College. America's unique way of picking her president, for it or against it.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,680
You might want to know there's a plan to use the Electoral College to subvert the Electoral College.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,840
It's a sneaky plan and to understand, remember that while it feels like citizens pick the

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
president in one big election, they don't. The 50 states pick the president.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
Oh, and District of Columbia. But not you, Puerto Rico. Come back when you're a state.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
How the states come together and how they vote is what the Electoral College is.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,120
Each state gets votes proportional to her population plus two, and is free to cast

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,200
these votes however she wants. Most look at how their citizens voted and give all their

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
Electoral College votes to the statewide winner. But they don't have to. A couple states cast their

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
votes proportional-ish to their citizens' preferences. But states are free to vote,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
however, including against the preferences of their citizens. Let's make a note of that.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,680
But back to this plus two, which is why some citizens really don't like the Electoral College.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,200
The plus two means the states less populous produce preponderant presidential picking

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
power per person. At the extremes, some states get one vote per low hundred thousand people

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,520
and some states one vote per high hundred thousand. This is how the Electoral College

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,640
sometimes picks a president that, nationwide, most citizens didn't. Because roughly 80%

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,000
of the state's votes are given by population and 20% aren't. This is on purpose. Dividing

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,560
power between the levels of citizen, state, and federal is and was a central point of the

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,640
Constitution. It's a compromise-titution. So if you went back in time to when the

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
states were about to finalize the deal, yelling,

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,840
The reply would be,

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,520
Yes. But the people. The people. You can't trust the people. Do you think this compromise-titution

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,800
is for a direct democracy, Lal? We're building a republic here.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,880
Yes, I know. But would you just look at this spreadsheet of

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,480
How many states are there in the future?

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,240
50. Maybe 51, depending on how.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Wow, what a tremendous success. Go compromise-titution.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
No, can we focus?

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
Do you even own land?

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,760
No.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
Then why would we listen to you?

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,760
Goodbye.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Thus, the Electoral College is doing what it was designed to do totally on purpose.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
And the Supreme Court has reaffirmed this. So if you don't like the Electoral College,

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,480
then tough noogies for you. And if you do, then nothing to worry about. The Electoral

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,640
College in a fortress of axiomatic constitutionality has survived for a

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
thousand generations of this republic. The only way to break through the front gate

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,880
would be with a constitutional amendment, but getting enough states to push on the

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
same side of that gromulent tool while not theoretically impossible is legislatively

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,040
improbable. This is where the sneaky plan comes in. Did you forget about that?

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
Don't worry, I got carried away.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,960
There is a backdoor that, if breached, can turn the constitutional fortress protecting

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,280
the Electoral College into a prison. The sneaky plan is named the National Popular

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Vote Interstate Compact. It's a terrible name, probably on purpose to hide sneakiness

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,360
behind boringness as bureaucratic paperwork camouflage. But I'm calling it Napa Vo

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Interco, which is sort of not really better, but whatever. Here are the sneaky deets.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
1. Assume destroying the constitutional protections of the Electoral College is

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,880
impossible. Point 2 is the note from before that states can cast their Electoral College

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,400
votes however they want. These are just facts, but if a state signs on the dotted line,

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,920
point 3 is the big deal. Napa Vo Interco members agree to cast their Electoral College

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,600
votes for the candidate who gets the most votes from citizens nationwide. This is the

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,040
National Popular Vote in Napa Vo Interco. The idea behind 2 plus 3 is to make it

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,920
impossible to have a president most of the citizens didn't vote for. A state would look

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,960
not only at the result in her borders, but the results nationwide, and vote that way.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,080
Which is all fine and dandy if the state citizens voted with the majority anyway. But if they

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,080
didn't, well, you can see a flaw with the plan. Any singular state assaulting the Electoral College

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
on her own, carrying votes against her own citizens, it's political suicide from without

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,720
and within. So the plan, had it only 3 points, is something no state would agree to, requiring

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,240
one last sneak. Point 4, the plan does not go into effect until enough states with enough votes to

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,680
control the Electoral College as a bloc join. So, as states sign up, the total number of

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Electoral College votes they control goes up, but nothing happens. Elections pass and states still

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,080
vote the traditional way, while recruiting allies to the cause. What are you guys up to over there?

63
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh us? Nothing. Just chillin, just hanging out. But once a controlling majority of Electoral College

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,840
votes is reached, Point 4 is satisfied, and, when it's time for the next election, charge.

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,720
Altogether, all at once, in through the back, the Electoral College is captured, the fortress is now

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,400
a prison. From this moment on, the Napavo Interco bloc promises the candidate who gets the most

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,320
citizen votes nationwide gets their controlling majority and becomes the president. Without

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,920
amending the constitution, the Electoral College has become totally pointless by using its

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,840
protection of states' right to vote however they want into the vital tool to functionally

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,960
remove state votes entirely, making the presidential election into one not of states,

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,560
but of citizens. And there's no problem with this plan at all, except, of course, the instant this

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,440
popular coup occurred, states outside the compact will storm the Supreme Court, who will then be

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,440
forced to deal with everyone yelling all at once about the future of how the president will be

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,040
elected, which will be amazing to watch no matter which side the gavel of constitutional

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,600
interpretation comes down upon. That's the plan. It's been around for a while and has enough

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,120
confirmed signatures to be more than halfway to the trigger point. And, in theory, enough states

77
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,640
have laws currently pending in their legislatures that, if passed, would put Napavo Interco into

78
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,920
action for the next election. Though, of course, it's easier to agree to things while they're far

79
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,600
away and uncertain to happen, and the reality of voting against your citizens merely theoretical.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
So it may be much more difficult to get the final triggering 2% than the promised first 49. But the

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,000
Electoral College, for it or against it, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,520
the sneaky plan to use it to subvert it.
