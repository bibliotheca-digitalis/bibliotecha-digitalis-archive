00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
The Electoral College. America's unique way of picking her president, for it or against it.

00:05.120 --> 00:09.680
You might want to know there's a plan to use the Electoral College to subvert the Electoral College.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.840
It's a sneaky plan and to understand, remember that while it feels like citizens pick the

00:13.840 --> 00:18.240
president in one big election, they don't. The 50 states pick the president.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.320
Oh, and District of Columbia. But not you, Puerto Rico. Come back when you're a state.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.880
How the states come together and how they vote is what the Electoral College is.

00:26.880 --> 00:31.120
Each state gets votes proportional to her population plus two, and is free to cast

00:31.120 --> 00:35.200
these votes however she wants. Most look at how their citizens voted and give all their

00:35.200 --> 00:40.000
Electoral College votes to the statewide winner. But they don't have to. A couple states cast their

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
votes proportional-ish to their citizens' preferences. But states are free to vote,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.640
however, including against the preferences of their citizens. Let's make a note of that.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.680
But back to this plus two, which is why some citizens really don't like the Electoral College.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.200
The plus two means the states less populous produce preponderant presidential picking

00:57.200 --> 01:01.440
power per person. At the extremes, some states get one vote per low hundred thousand people

01:01.440 --> 01:05.520
and some states one vote per high hundred thousand. This is how the Electoral College

01:05.520 --> 01:10.640
sometimes picks a president that, nationwide, most citizens didn't. Because roughly 80%

01:10.640 --> 01:16.000
of the state's votes are given by population and 20% aren't. This is on purpose. Dividing

01:16.000 --> 01:20.560
power between the levels of citizen, state, and federal is and was a central point of the

01:20.560 --> 01:24.640
Constitution. It's a compromise-titution. So if you went back in time to when the

01:24.640 --> 01:27.200
states were about to finalize the deal, yelling,

01:35.040 --> 01:35.840
The reply would be,

01:43.280 --> 01:49.520
Yes. But the people. The people. You can't trust the people. Do you think this compromise-titution

01:49.520 --> 01:52.800
is for a direct democracy, Lal? We're building a republic here.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.880
Yes, I know. But would you just look at this spreadsheet of

01:54.880 --> 01:56.480
How many states are there in the future?

01:56.480 --> 01:58.240
50. Maybe 51, depending on how.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.880
Wow, what a tremendous success. Go compromise-titution.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.760
No, can we focus?

02:01.760 --> 02:03.200
Do you even own land?

02:03.200 --> 02:03.760
No.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.040
Then why would we listen to you?

02:05.040 --> 02:05.760
Goodbye.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.840
Thus, the Electoral College is doing what it was designed to do totally on purpose.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.760
And the Supreme Court has reaffirmed this. So if you don't like the Electoral College,

02:13.760 --> 02:18.480
then tough noogies for you. And if you do, then nothing to worry about. The Electoral

02:18.480 --> 02:22.640
College in a fortress of axiomatic constitutionality has survived for a

02:22.640 --> 02:27.120
thousand generations of this republic. The only way to break through the front gate

02:27.120 --> 02:30.880
would be with a constitutional amendment, but getting enough states to push on the

02:30.880 --> 02:35.440
same side of that gromulent tool while not theoretically impossible is legislatively

02:35.440 --> 02:39.040
improbable. This is where the sneaky plan comes in. Did you forget about that?

02:39.040 --> 02:40.480
Don't worry, I got carried away.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.960
There is a backdoor that, if breached, can turn the constitutional fortress protecting

02:44.960 --> 02:49.280
the Electoral College into a prison. The sneaky plan is named the National Popular

02:49.280 --> 02:54.560
Vote Interstate Compact. It's a terrible name, probably on purpose to hide sneakiness

02:54.560 --> 02:59.360
behind boringness as bureaucratic paperwork camouflage. But I'm calling it Napa Vo

02:59.360 --> 03:03.280
Interco, which is sort of not really better, but whatever. Here are the sneaky deets.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.440
1. Assume destroying the constitutional protections of the Electoral College is

03:07.440 --> 03:12.880
impossible. Point 2 is the note from before that states can cast their Electoral College

03:12.880 --> 03:18.400
votes however they want. These are just facts, but if a state signs on the dotted line,

03:18.400 --> 03:23.920
point 3 is the big deal. Napa Vo Interco members agree to cast their Electoral College

03:23.920 --> 03:29.600
votes for the candidate who gets the most votes from citizens nationwide. This is the

03:29.600 --> 03:35.040
National Popular Vote in Napa Vo Interco. The idea behind 2 plus 3 is to make it

03:35.040 --> 03:39.920
impossible to have a president most of the citizens didn't vote for. A state would look

03:39.920 --> 03:44.960
not only at the result in her borders, but the results nationwide, and vote that way.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.080
Which is all fine and dandy if the state citizens voted with the majority anyway. But if they

03:50.080 --> 03:56.080
didn't, well, you can see a flaw with the plan. Any singular state assaulting the Electoral College

03:56.080 --> 04:01.200
on her own, carrying votes against her own citizens, it's political suicide from without

04:01.200 --> 04:06.720
and within. So the plan, had it only 3 points, is something no state would agree to, requiring

04:06.720 --> 04:12.240
one last sneak. Point 4, the plan does not go into effect until enough states with enough votes to

04:12.240 --> 04:17.680
control the Electoral College as a bloc join. So, as states sign up, the total number of

04:17.680 --> 04:23.520
Electoral College votes they control goes up, but nothing happens. Elections pass and states still

04:23.520 --> 04:28.080
vote the traditional way, while recruiting allies to the cause. What are you guys up to over there?

04:28.080 --> 04:32.800
Oh us? Nothing. Just chillin, just hanging out. But once a controlling majority of Electoral College

04:32.800 --> 04:37.840
votes is reached, Point 4 is satisfied, and, when it's time for the next election, charge.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.720
Altogether, all at once, in through the back, the Electoral College is captured, the fortress is now

04:42.720 --> 04:48.400
a prison. From this moment on, the Napavo Interco bloc promises the candidate who gets the most

04:48.400 --> 04:54.320
citizen votes nationwide gets their controlling majority and becomes the president. Without

04:54.320 --> 04:59.920
amending the constitution, the Electoral College has become totally pointless by using its

04:59.920 --> 05:05.840
protection of states' right to vote however they want into the vital tool to functionally

05:05.840 --> 05:10.960
remove state votes entirely, making the presidential election into one not of states,

05:10.960 --> 05:16.560
but of citizens. And there's no problem with this plan at all, except, of course, the instant this

05:16.560 --> 05:21.440
popular coup occurred, states outside the compact will storm the Supreme Court, who will then be

05:21.440 --> 05:27.440
forced to deal with everyone yelling all at once about the future of how the president will be

05:27.440 --> 05:33.040
elected, which will be amazing to watch no matter which side the gavel of constitutional

05:33.040 --> 05:37.600
interpretation comes down upon. That's the plan. It's been around for a while and has enough

05:37.600 --> 05:43.120
confirmed signatures to be more than halfway to the trigger point. And, in theory, enough states

05:43.120 --> 05:48.640
have laws currently pending in their legislatures that, if passed, would put Napavo Interco into

05:48.640 --> 05:53.920
action for the next election. Though, of course, it's easier to agree to things while they're far

05:53.920 --> 05:59.600
away and uncertain to happen, and the reality of voting against your citizens merely theoretical.

05:59.600 --> 06:05.120
So it may be much more difficult to get the final triggering 2% than the promised first 49. But the

06:05.120 --> 06:10.000
Electoral College, for it or against it, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is

06:10.000 --> 06:13.520
the sneaky plan to use it to subvert it.
