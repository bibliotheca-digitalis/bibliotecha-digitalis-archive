0	5120	The Electoral College. America's unique way of picking her president, for it or against it.
5120	9680	You might want to know there's a plan to use the Electoral College to subvert the Electoral College.
9680	13840	It's a sneaky plan and to understand, remember that while it feels like citizens pick the
13840	18240	president in one big election, they don't. The 50 states pick the president.
18240	22320	Oh, and District of Columbia. But not you, Puerto Rico. Come back when you're a state.
22320	26880	How the states come together and how they vote is what the Electoral College is.
26880	31120	Each state gets votes proportional to her population plus two, and is free to cast
31120	35200	these votes however she wants. Most look at how their citizens voted and give all their
35200	40000	Electoral College votes to the statewide winner. But they don't have to. A couple states cast their
40000	44000	votes proportional-ish to their citizens' preferences. But states are free to vote,
44000	48640	however, including against the preferences of their citizens. Let's make a note of that.
48640	53680	But back to this plus two, which is why some citizens really don't like the Electoral College.
53760	57200	The plus two means the states less populous produce preponderant presidential picking
57200	61440	power per person. At the extremes, some states get one vote per low hundred thousand people
61440	65520	and some states one vote per high hundred thousand. This is how the Electoral College
65520	70640	sometimes picks a president that, nationwide, most citizens didn't. Because roughly 80%
70640	76000	of the state's votes are given by population and 20% aren't. This is on purpose. Dividing
76000	80560	power between the levels of citizen, state, and federal is and was a central point of the
80560	84640	Constitution. It's a compromise-titution. So if you went back in time to when the
84640	87200	states were about to finalize the deal, yelling,
95040	95840	The reply would be,
103280	109520	Yes. But the people. The people. You can't trust the people. Do you think this compromise-titution
109520	112800	is for a direct democracy, Lal? We're building a republic here.
112800	114880	Yes, I know. But would you just look at this spreadsheet of
114880	116480	How many states are there in the future?
116480	118240	50. Maybe 51, depending on how.
118240	120880	Wow, what a tremendous success. Go compromise-titution.
120880	121760	No, can we focus?
121760	123200	Do you even own land?
123200	123760	No.
123760	125040	Then why would we listen to you?
125040	125760	Goodbye.
125760	129840	Thus, the Electoral College is doing what it was designed to do totally on purpose.
129840	133760	And the Supreme Court has reaffirmed this. So if you don't like the Electoral College,
133760	138480	then tough noogies for you. And if you do, then nothing to worry about. The Electoral
138480	142640	College in a fortress of axiomatic constitutionality has survived for a
142640	147120	thousand generations of this republic. The only way to break through the front gate
147120	150880	would be with a constitutional amendment, but getting enough states to push on the
150880	155440	same side of that gromulent tool while not theoretically impossible is legislatively
155440	159040	improbable. This is where the sneaky plan comes in. Did you forget about that?
159040	160480	Don't worry, I got carried away.
160480	164960	There is a backdoor that, if breached, can turn the constitutional fortress protecting
164960	169280	the Electoral College into a prison. The sneaky plan is named the National Popular
169280	174560	Vote Interstate Compact. It's a terrible name, probably on purpose to hide sneakiness
174560	179360	behind boringness as bureaucratic paperwork camouflage. But I'm calling it Napa Vo
179360	183280	Interco, which is sort of not really better, but whatever. Here are the sneaky deets.
183280	187440	1. Assume destroying the constitutional protections of the Electoral College is
187440	192880	impossible. Point 2 is the note from before that states can cast their Electoral College
192880	198400	votes however they want. These are just facts, but if a state signs on the dotted line,
198400	203920	point 3 is the big deal. Napa Vo Interco members agree to cast their Electoral College
203920	209600	votes for the candidate who gets the most votes from citizens nationwide. This is the
209600	215040	National Popular Vote in Napa Vo Interco. The idea behind 2 plus 3 is to make it
215040	219920	impossible to have a president most of the citizens didn't vote for. A state would look
219920	224960	not only at the result in her borders, but the results nationwide, and vote that way.
224960	230080	Which is all fine and dandy if the state citizens voted with the majority anyway. But if they
230080	236080	didn't, well, you can see a flaw with the plan. Any singular state assaulting the Electoral College
236080	241200	on her own, carrying votes against her own citizens, it's political suicide from without
241200	246720	and within. So the plan, had it only 3 points, is something no state would agree to, requiring
246720	252240	one last sneak. Point 4, the plan does not go into effect until enough states with enough votes to
252240	257680	control the Electoral College as a bloc join. So, as states sign up, the total number of
257680	263520	Electoral College votes they control goes up, but nothing happens. Elections pass and states still
263520	268080	vote the traditional way, while recruiting allies to the cause. What are you guys up to over there?
268080	272800	Oh us? Nothing. Just chillin, just hanging out. But once a controlling majority of Electoral College
272800	277840	votes is reached, Point 4 is satisfied, and, when it's time for the next election, charge.
277840	282720	Altogether, all at once, in through the back, the Electoral College is captured, the fortress is now
282720	288400	a prison. From this moment on, the Napavo Interco bloc promises the candidate who gets the most
288400	294320	citizen votes nationwide gets their controlling majority and becomes the president. Without
294320	299920	amending the constitution, the Electoral College has become totally pointless by using its
299920	305840	protection of states' right to vote however they want into the vital tool to functionally
305840	310960	remove state votes entirely, making the presidential election into one not of states,
310960	316560	but of citizens. And there's no problem with this plan at all, except, of course, the instant this
316560	321440	popular coup occurred, states outside the compact will storm the Supreme Court, who will then be
321440	327440	forced to deal with everyone yelling all at once about the future of how the president will be
327440	333040	elected, which will be amazing to watch no matter which side the gavel of constitutional
333040	337600	interpretation comes down upon. That's the plan. It's been around for a while and has enough
337600	343120	confirmed signatures to be more than halfway to the trigger point. And, in theory, enough states
343120	348640	have laws currently pending in their legislatures that, if passed, would put Napavo Interco into
348640	353920	action for the next election. Though, of course, it's easier to agree to things while they're far
353920	359600	away and uncertain to happen, and the reality of voting against your citizens merely theoretical.
359600	365120	So it may be much more difficult to get the final triggering 2% than the promised first 49. But the
365120	370000	Electoral College, for it or against it, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is
370000	373520	the sneaky plan to use it to subvert it.
