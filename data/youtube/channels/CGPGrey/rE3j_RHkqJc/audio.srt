00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Hello internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,880
Cat photos, news stories, belief structures, funny gifs, educational videos, not-so-educational videos.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,200
And your thinking inventory is limited.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,360
A thought without a brain to think it dies.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,920
Now, we can treat thoughts as though they're alive.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,000
Specifically, alive like germs.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,040
That might sound weird, but stick with me.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,160
Take jokes.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,040
Jokes are thought germs that live in your brain, and when you tell the joke to another brain,

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,720
you help it to reproduce.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,440
Just like when you have the flu and sneeze to help it reproduce.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,560
This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth, and this one by words through the ear,

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,760
but it's reproduction either way.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
Logging onto your social media, then, is exposing yourself to everyone's mental sneezes.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,320
Each post a glob of snot with a thought germ trying to get into your brain.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,560
If not for permanent residents, then at least long enough to get you to press the share button

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
and sneeze it with everyone you know.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,920
In this analogy, then, a funny cat photo with the perfect caption is a super flu.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,120
Now, just as germs exploit weak points in your immune system,

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,840
so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain, aka emotions.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,000
Once inside, thought germs that press emotional buttons get their host to spread them more.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,200
Measurably more.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,480
Well, except sadness.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,240
Sad thoughts don't get very far.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,760
Awe is pretty good, which is why websites that construct thought germs like biological weapons

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,040
arm them with titles like seven whatevers that will blow your mind,

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,640
or the shocking secret behind this thing.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,000
But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought germ.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,920
Anger bypasses your mental immune system and compels you to share it like nothing else.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,520
Being aware of your brain's weak spots is necessary for good mental health,

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,480
like knowing how to wash your hands.

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,680
Because even without intentional construction,

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,360
any thought germ on the internet can, on its own, grow more infectious as it spreads.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,080
To talk about why, let's forget anger for a moment and go back to that cat photo.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,480
Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,720
and most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos, or baby photos,

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,960
posted on the internet that are never shared.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,520
But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,600
because just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs,

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,920
so the internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,520
For once on board, that cat photo can leap into other brains,

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,520
and those brains might share it, and, here's the key point,

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,000
occasionally change it.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,360
A Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there.

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
Most changes are terrible, but some make the thought germ even funnier,

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
getting more brains to share it, which results in more changes and a shot at superstardom.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,880
Thus, a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination,

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,200
at least for a few hours.

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,160
The internet, with its unparalleled ability to share and randomly change thought germs,

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,040
can't help but make them stronger.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,520
With jokes, that's awesome, but with angry germs, not always so awesome, no.

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,600
Angry germs, the more they're shared, undergo the same process,

53
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,240
changing and distorting to be more aggravating.

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,760
These have a better chance of spreading than their possibly more accurate,

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,280
but probably also more boring, rivals.

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,920
But like plagues, thought germs can burn through a population too quickly.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,800
Just watch your favorite meme-generating machine for a week,

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,960
and you'll see the life cycle fly by.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,640
However, some thought germs have found a way around burnout.

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,960
Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought germs live in your head,

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,680
and which you fight for, the next section might sound horrifying.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,920
So please keep in mind, we're talking about what makes some thought germs successful,

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,960
particularly angry ones, and not how good or how bad the thoughts themselves are.

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Deep breath, calm.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,600
Thought germs can burn out, because once everyone agrees,

66
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,080
it's hard to keep talking, and thus thinking about them.

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,960
But if there's an opposing thought germ, an argument, then the thinking never has to stop.

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,440
The disagreement doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry helps.

69
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,520
The more visible an argument gets, the more bystanders it draws in, which makes it more visible,

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,360
which is why every group from the most innocuous internet forum to the national conversation

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,720
can turn into a double rage storm across the sky in no time.

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,440
Wait, these thought germs aren't competing, they're cooperating.

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,160
Working together, they reach more brains and hold their thoughts longer than they could alone.

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,560
Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic.

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,400
One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular can employ is, you're with us or against us.

76
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Whatever thought germ does leapt to the front of your brain, push it back.

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,040
This video isn't about that.

78
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,160
We're just talking about this tool, which makes it very hard for neutral brains to resist.

79
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,160
and its divisiveness also grows its symbiotic partner.

80
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,680
This explains why in some arguments, gaining more allies also gains more enemies.

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Because though the participants think they're involved in a fiery battle to the death,

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,600
from the anger germs perspective, one side is a field of flowers and the other a flock of butterflies.

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,840
Of course planting more flowers will get you more butterflies,

84
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,080
and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers.

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,960
If there is some argument that splits the population and lasts forever,

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,160
and that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,

87
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,760
you just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached ecological stability.

88
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Now, one final depressing thought.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
I mean, one more awe-inspiring point that will reveal the secrets of...

90
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
Actually, no, it's just depressing.

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,600
When opposing groups get big, they don't really argue with each other.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,160
They mostly argue with themselves about how angry the other group makes them.

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,200
We can actually graph fights on the internet to see this in action.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,680
Each becomes its own quasi-isolated internet sharing thoughts about the other.

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,320
You see where this is going, right?

96
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,200
Each group breeds thought germs about the other,

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,280
and as before, the most enraging, but not necessarily the most accurate, spread the fastest.

98
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,160
The group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other so enraging they'll talk about it all the time,

99
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,280
which, now that you know how thought germs grow, is exactly what makes the totem always perfectly maddening.

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,800
Now, all this isn't to say there's no point in arguing.

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
That's a different video.

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,880
Or that the internet isn't amazing or that there aren't things worth trying to change people's minds about.

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Thought germs of all kinds come and go.

104
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,680
But it's useful to be aware of how thoughts can use our emotions to spread

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,400
and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread,

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,840
the more chances it has to become even better at spreading through random changes that are made to it.

107
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,640
Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible.

108
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,400
But if you want to maintain a healthy brain,

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,160
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that poke you where you're weakest.

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,400
It's your brain, be hygienic with it.
