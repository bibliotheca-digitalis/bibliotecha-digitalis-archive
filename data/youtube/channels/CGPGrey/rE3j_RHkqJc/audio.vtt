00:00.000 --> 00:02.660
Hello internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain.

00:02.660 --> 00:07.880
Cat photos, news stories, belief structures, funny gifs, educational videos, not-so-educational videos.

00:07.880 --> 00:10.200
And your thinking inventory is limited.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.360
A thought without a brain to think it dies.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.920
Now, we can treat thoughts as though they're alive.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.000
Specifically, alive like germs.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.040
That might sound weird, but stick with me.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.160
Take jokes.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.040
Jokes are thought germs that live in your brain, and when you tell the joke to another brain,

00:24.040 --> 00:25.720
you help it to reproduce.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.440
Just like when you have the flu and sneeze to help it reproduce.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.560
This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth, and this one by words through the ear,

00:33.560 --> 00:35.760
but it's reproduction either way.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.160
Logging onto your social media, then, is exposing yourself to everyone's mental sneezes.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.320
Each post a glob of snot with a thought germ trying to get into your brain.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.560
If not for permanent residents, then at least long enough to get you to press the share button

00:48.560 --> 00:50.560
and sneeze it with everyone you know.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.920
In this analogy, then, a funny cat photo with the perfect caption is a super flu.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.120
Now, just as germs exploit weak points in your immune system,

00:58.120 --> 01:02.840
so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain, aka emotions.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.000
Once inside, thought germs that press emotional buttons get their host to spread them more.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.200
Measurably more.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.480
Well, except sadness.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.240
Sad thoughts don't get very far.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.760
Awe is pretty good, which is why websites that construct thought germs like biological weapons

01:15.760 --> 01:19.040
arm them with titles like seven whatevers that will blow your mind,

01:19.040 --> 01:21.640
or the shocking secret behind this thing.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.000
But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought germ.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.920
Anger bypasses your mental immune system and compels you to share it like nothing else.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.520
Being aware of your brain's weak spots is necessary for good mental health,

01:32.520 --> 01:34.480
like knowing how to wash your hands.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.680
Because even without intentional construction,

01:36.680 --> 01:41.360
any thought germ on the internet can, on its own, grow more infectious as it spreads.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.080
To talk about why, let's forget anger for a moment and go back to that cat photo.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.480
Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,

01:47.480 --> 01:51.720
and most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos, or baby photos,

01:51.720 --> 01:53.960
posted on the internet that are never shared.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.520
But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,

01:57.520 --> 02:01.600
because just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs,

02:01.600 --> 02:04.920
so the internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.520
For once on board, that cat photo can leap into other brains,

02:08.520 --> 02:11.520
and those brains might share it, and, here's the key point,

02:11.520 --> 02:13.000
occasionally change it.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.360
A Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.560
Most changes are terrible, but some make the thought germ even funnier,

02:18.560 --> 02:23.200
getting more brains to share it, which results in more changes and a shot at superstardom.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.880
Thus, a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination,

02:26.880 --> 02:28.200
at least for a few hours.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.160
The internet, with its unparalleled ability to share and randomly change thought germs,

02:32.160 --> 02:34.040
can't help but make them stronger.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.520
With jokes, that's awesome, but with angry germs, not always so awesome, no.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.600
Angry germs, the more they're shared, undergo the same process,

02:41.600 --> 02:44.240
changing and distorting to be more aggravating.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.760
These have a better chance of spreading than their possibly more accurate,

02:47.760 --> 02:50.280
but probably also more boring, rivals.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.920
But like plagues, thought germs can burn through a population too quickly.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.800
Just watch your favorite meme-generating machine for a week,

02:56.800 --> 02:58.960
and you'll see the life cycle fly by.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.640
However, some thought germs have found a way around burnout.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.960
Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought germs live in your head,

03:04.960 --> 03:08.680
and which you fight for, the next section might sound horrifying.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.920
So please keep in mind, we're talking about what makes some thought germs successful,

03:12.920 --> 03:17.960
particularly angry ones, and not how good or how bad the thoughts themselves are.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.680
Deep breath, calm.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.600
Thought germs can burn out, because once everyone agrees,

03:22.600 --> 03:25.080
it's hard to keep talking, and thus thinking about them.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.960
But if there's an opposing thought germ, an argument, then the thinking never has to stop.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.440
The disagreement doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry helps.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.520
The more visible an argument gets, the more bystanders it draws in, which makes it more visible,

03:37.520 --> 03:42.360
which is why every group from the most innocuous internet forum to the national conversation

03:42.360 --> 03:46.720
can turn into a double rage storm across the sky in no time.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.440
Wait, these thought germs aren't competing, they're cooperating.

03:50.440 --> 03:55.160
Working together, they reach more brains and hold their thoughts longer than they could alone.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.560
Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic.

03:58.560 --> 04:03.400
One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular can employ is, you're with us or against us.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.200
Whatever thought germ does leapt to the front of your brain, push it back.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.040
This video isn't about that.

04:08.040 --> 04:14.160
We're just talking about this tool, which makes it very hard for neutral brains to resist.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.160
and its divisiveness also grows its symbiotic partner.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.680
This explains why in some arguments, gaining more allies also gains more enemies.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.600
Because though the participants think they're involved in a fiery battle to the death,

04:27.600 --> 04:33.600
from the anger germs perspective, one side is a field of flowers and the other a flock of butterflies.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.840
Of course planting more flowers will get you more butterflies,

04:36.840 --> 04:40.080
and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.960
If there is some argument that splits the population and lasts forever,

04:43.960 --> 04:47.160
and that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,

04:47.160 --> 04:53.760
you just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached ecological stability.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.600
Now, one final depressing thought.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.520
I mean, one more awe-inspiring point that will reveal the secrets of...

04:59.520 --> 05:01.280
Actually, no, it's just depressing.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.600
When opposing groups get big, they don't really argue with each other.

05:04.600 --> 05:09.160
They mostly argue with themselves about how angry the other group makes them.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.200
We can actually graph fights on the internet to see this in action.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.680
Each becomes its own quasi-isolated internet sharing thoughts about the other.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.320
You see where this is going, right?

05:18.320 --> 05:21.200
Each group breeds thought germs about the other,

05:21.200 --> 05:26.280
and as before, the most enraging, but not necessarily the most accurate, spread the fastest.

05:26.280 --> 05:32.160
The group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other so enraging they'll talk about it all the time,

05:32.160 --> 05:38.280
which, now that you know how thought germs grow, is exactly what makes the totem always perfectly maddening.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.800
Now, all this isn't to say there's no point in arguing.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.120
That's a different video.

05:42.120 --> 05:46.880
Or that the internet isn't amazing or that there aren't things worth trying to change people's minds about.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.040
Thought germs of all kinds come and go.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.680
But it's useful to be aware of how thoughts can use our emotions to spread

05:52.680 --> 05:55.400
and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread,

05:55.400 --> 06:00.840
the more chances it has to become even better at spreading through random changes that are made to it.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.640
Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.400
But if you want to maintain a healthy brain,

06:05.400 --> 06:11.160
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that poke you where you're weakest.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.400
It's your brain, be hygienic with it.
