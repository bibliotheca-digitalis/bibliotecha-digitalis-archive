0	2660	Hello internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain.
2660	7880	Cat photos, news stories, belief structures, funny gifs, educational videos, not-so-educational videos.
7880	10200	And your thinking inventory is limited.
10200	12360	A thought without a brain to think it dies.
12360	14920	Now, we can treat thoughts as though they're alive.
14920	17000	Specifically, alive like germs.
17000	19040	That might sound weird, but stick with me.
19040	20160	Take jokes.
20160	24040	Jokes are thought germs that live in your brain, and when you tell the joke to another brain,
24040	25720	you help it to reproduce.
25720	29440	Just like when you have the flu and sneeze to help it reproduce.
29440	33560	This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth, and this one by words through the ear,
33560	35760	but it's reproduction either way.
35760	40160	Logging onto your social media, then, is exposing yourself to everyone's mental sneezes.
40160	44320	Each post a glob of snot with a thought germ trying to get into your brain.
44320	48560	If not for permanent residents, then at least long enough to get you to press the share button
48560	50560	and sneeze it with everyone you know.
50560	54920	In this analogy, then, a funny cat photo with the perfect caption is a super flu.
55000	58120	Now, just as germs exploit weak points in your immune system,
58120	62840	so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain, aka emotions.
62840	67000	Once inside, thought germs that press emotional buttons get their host to spread them more.
67000	68200	Measurably more.
68200	69480	Well, except sadness.
69480	71240	Sad thoughts don't get very far.
71240	75760	Awe is pretty good, which is why websites that construct thought germs like biological weapons
75760	79040	arm them with titles like seven whatevers that will blow your mind,
79040	81640	or the shocking secret behind this thing.
81640	84000	But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought germ.
84000	88920	Anger bypasses your mental immune system and compels you to share it like nothing else.
88920	92520	Being aware of your brain's weak spots is necessary for good mental health,
92520	94480	like knowing how to wash your hands.
94480	96680	Because even without intentional construction,
96680	101360	any thought germ on the internet can, on its own, grow more infectious as it spreads.
101360	105080	To talk about why, let's forget anger for a moment and go back to that cat photo.
105080	107480	Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,
107480	111720	and most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos, or baby photos,
111720	113960	posted on the internet that are never shared.
113960	117520	But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,
117520	121600	because just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs,
121600	124920	so the internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs.
124920	128520	For once on board, that cat photo can leap into other brains,
128520	131520	and those brains might share it, and, here's the key point,
131520	133000	occasionally change it.
133000	135360	A Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there.
135360	138560	Most changes are terrible, but some make the thought germ even funnier,
138560	143200	getting more brains to share it, which results in more changes and a shot at superstardom.
143200	146880	Thus, a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination,
146880	148200	at least for a few hours.
148200	152160	The internet, with its unparalleled ability to share and randomly change thought germs,
152160	154040	can't help but make them stronger.
154040	158520	With jokes, that's awesome, but with angry germs, not always so awesome, no.
158520	161600	Angry germs, the more they're shared, undergo the same process,
161600	164240	changing and distorting to be more aggravating.
164240	167760	These have a better chance of spreading than their possibly more accurate,
167760	170280	but probably also more boring, rivals.
170280	173920	But like plagues, thought germs can burn through a population too quickly.
173920	176800	Just watch your favorite meme-generating machine for a week,
176800	178960	and you'll see the life cycle fly by.
178960	181640	However, some thought germs have found a way around burnout.
181640	184960	Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought germs live in your head,
184960	188680	and which you fight for, the next section might sound horrifying.
188680	192920	So please keep in mind, we're talking about what makes some thought germs successful,
192920	197960	particularly angry ones, and not how good or how bad the thoughts themselves are.
197960	199680	Deep breath, calm.
199680	202600	Thought germs can burn out, because once everyone agrees,
202600	205080	it's hard to keep talking, and thus thinking about them.
205080	209960	But if there's an opposing thought germ, an argument, then the thinking never has to stop.
209960	213440	The disagreement doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry helps.
213440	217520	The more visible an argument gets, the more bystanders it draws in, which makes it more visible,
217520	222360	which is why every group from the most innocuous internet forum to the national conversation
222360	226720	can turn into a double rage storm across the sky in no time.
226720	230440	Wait, these thought germs aren't competing, they're cooperating.
230440	235160	Working together, they reach more brains and hold their thoughts longer than they could alone.
235160	238560	Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic.
238560	243400	One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular can employ is, you're with us or against us.
243400	246200	Whatever thought germ does leapt to the front of your brain, push it back.
246200	248040	This video isn't about that.
248040	254160	We're just talking about this tool, which makes it very hard for neutral brains to resist.
254160	258160	and its divisiveness also grows its symbiotic partner.
258160	263680	This explains why in some arguments, gaining more allies also gains more enemies.
263680	267600	Because though the participants think they're involved in a fiery battle to the death,
267600	273600	from the anger germs perspective, one side is a field of flowers and the other a flock of butterflies.
273600	276840	Of course planting more flowers will get you more butterflies,
276840	280080	and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers.
280120	283960	If there is some argument that splits the population and lasts forever,
283960	287160	and that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,
287160	293760	you just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached ecological stability.
293760	295600	Now, one final depressing thought.
295600	299520	I mean, one more awe-inspiring point that will reveal the secrets of...
299520	301280	Actually, no, it's just depressing.
301280	304600	When opposing groups get big, they don't really argue with each other.
304600	309160	They mostly argue with themselves about how angry the other group makes them.
309160	312200	We can actually graph fights on the internet to see this in action.
312200	316680	Each becomes its own quasi-isolated internet sharing thoughts about the other.
316680	318320	You see where this is going, right?
318320	321200	Each group breeds thought germs about the other,
321200	326280	and as before, the most enraging, but not necessarily the most accurate, spread the fastest.
326280	332160	The group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other so enraging they'll talk about it all the time,
332160	338280	which, now that you know how thought germs grow, is exactly what makes the totem always perfectly maddening.
338280	340800	Now, all this isn't to say there's no point in arguing.
340800	342120	That's a different video.
342120	346880	Or that the internet isn't amazing or that there aren't things worth trying to change people's minds about.
346880	349040	Thought germs of all kinds come and go.
349040	352680	But it's useful to be aware of how thoughts can use our emotions to spread
352680	355400	and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread,
355400	360840	the more chances it has to become even better at spreading through random changes that are made to it.
360840	363640	Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible.
363640	365400	But if you want to maintain a healthy brain,
365400	371160	it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that poke you where you're weakest.
371160	373400	It's your brain, be hygienic with it.
