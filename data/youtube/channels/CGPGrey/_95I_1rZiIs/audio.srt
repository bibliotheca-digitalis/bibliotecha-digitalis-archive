1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Primary elections are how political parties in the United States pick their

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,520
strongest candidate to run for president. The parties do this by holding many

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
elections in each of the states and the candidates with the most votes from

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,460
these elections becomes the party's official nominees. These nominees then

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,080
face each other in the national election for president. But this isn't the whole

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,400
story. There are five things that make it a bit more complicated than that.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Complication number one, primaries versus caucuses. In every state the local party

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,480
leaders decide how to run their elections. The two most common choices

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,080
are primaries and caucuses. Primaries are just like standard elections. Go to the

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,000
polls whenever you can, stand in a long line, hide in a booth, then tick a box or

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,080
press a button and your vote is cast in complete anonymity. A caucus however is a

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,440
public vote. People gather in groups wherever space is available then

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,280
literally take sides in a room with everyone else who likes the same

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,920
candidate. The groups debate each other and if people change their minds they

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,060
need to physically switch sides. At the end of the debates the party

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,060
representatives count the number of people in each group. If you leave too

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,620
early your vote doesn't count. This description of primaries and caucuses is

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,180
really all you need to know but the specifics can vary wildly. That's because

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,300
there are 50 states all of which hold at least two primaries and caucuses for the

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,580
big parties and possibly more for the small parties. Covering all the local

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,540
variants would take a tediously long time which your short attention span for

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,260
boring political videos wouldn't tolerate. And you need to stay focused

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,980
because there are four more things to come.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,020
Complication number two, who can vote. In the national presidential election all

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,660
American citizens over the age of 18 can vote with two exceptions. You can't

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,100
live here or here. But primaries are in-state elections with lots of

27
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,580
different rules. Most states and parties will only let you vote in the primary if

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,260
you're an official member of the party. This is called a closed primary because

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,540
the voting is closed to non party members. But some citizens are

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,100
independents and not registered with any party. If you're an independent and live

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,340
in a state with closed party elections, tough luck. No voting for you. Some states

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,740
however have semi closed primaries where independents can pick one and only one

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,260
primary to vote in. Parties allow this because the presidential election is

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,260
often determined by independents so knowing which candidates they like is

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,020
useful.

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,020
Finally a few states and parties really play it fast and loose with open

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,740
primaries. Here any citizen no matter which party they're registered with can

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,940
pick a primary to vote in. But it's not just the states that have primaries.

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,620
They're also held in the District of Columbia and the off forgotten

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,900
territories. Holding primaries here is a bit odd though considering that

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,420
territorial residents can't vote in the actual presidential election.

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,620
Lastly are the Americans living abroad who depending on the party vote in a

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,780
block as though they all live together in one big extra state. When all these

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,700
elections take place depends on...

45
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,940
Complication number three. Who votes when? Primaries aren't conducted all at once

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,740
but are spread out over a year.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,420
This leads to fights between the states about who gets to be at the head of the

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,420
line and who is stuck at the back.

49
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,500
Inevitably last-minute leapfrogging of dates happens even though the parties

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,740
often take away votes from these uncivil states. When it comes to being number one

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,860
nobody beats New Hampshire who wrote it into state law that their primary will

52
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,020
always be at least a week ahead of everyone else's. Which isn't a problem

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,140
until some other state gets the bright idea to do the same and then we have an

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
infinite loop in our system and have to force quit the law.

55
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,140
But wait you say, doesn't Iowa already go first? Yes but New Hampshire lets them

56
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,980
get away with it for two reasons.

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,620
First Iowa's election is a caucus and so New Hampshire is still technically the

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,100
first primary and second New Hampshire thinks that Iowa is stupid and doesn't

59
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,900
matter.

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,540
Other states try to boost their influence not by cutting in line but by

61
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,860
forming an alliance and holding their primaries at the same time. The biggest

62
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,220
alliance of the election cycle is called Super Tuesday where depending on

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,620
how many states can agree with each other around half of them might

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,100
participate giving out a whole pile of votes.

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Which brings us to complication number four, votes that aren't votes.

66
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,860
So this whole time you were probably thinking that citizens gave votes

67
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,780
straight to the candidates but no.

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,740
Instead the votes are given to a bunch of guys called delegates who in turn

69
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,780
give them to the candidates as requested.

70
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,940
Maybe. Depending on the state delegates might be required to vote as the

71
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,100
citizens did or they might be completely free to ignore the citizens and vote for

72
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,380
whomever they want.

73
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,420
Who are these people? The delegates are local party VIPs such as state reps and

74
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,820
officials. The more citizens who live in a state the more delegates that state

75
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,040
gets. Later in the year when all the states have finished their primaries the

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,980
delegates travel to a huge gathering for their party called the National

77
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,780
Convention.

78
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,060
It's here that the official vote to select the party's nominee for president

79
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,060
happens. But it's not just the delegates who do the voting.

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,380
Complication number five, super delegates. Super delegates are the top members of

81
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,700
the party such as congressmen and former presidents. They go to the National

82
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,660
Convention not to represent the people but to represent the current party

83
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,020
establishment and can vote for whomever they want.

84
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,140
Depending on the party super delegates might be up to 20 percent of the voters

85
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,740
at the National Convention. Usually by the time the National Convention happens

86
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,700
all the candidates save one have dropped out of the race so the convention is

87
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,380
just a rubber stamp and a big party. But if the fight between candidates is still

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,220
ongoing the delegates and super delegates are the ones with the final

89
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,060
decision. In summary, over the course of a year the states plus DC plus the

90
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,180
territories and the Americans abroad hold their primaries or caucuses. When

91
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,860
finished the delegates representing the citizens who voted in those elections

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,340
travel to the National Convention.

93
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,780
Most of the delegates are forced to vote as the citizens of their state wanted

94
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,380
them to but some of them are free to vote as they like. At the National

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,820
Convention the delegates meet up with the super delegates who represent the

96
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,540
best interests of the party and together they make the final decision on who will

97
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,800
be the nominee for president. Tired?

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Don't be because only now does the race for the presidency begin.

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:15,920
Of course you could skip all that and jump straight into the election as an

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,520
independent. The only downside to this strategy is near certain defeat.
