00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
Primary elections are how political parties in the United States pick their

00:03.880 --> 00:07.520
strongest candidate to run for president. The parties do this by holding many

00:07.520 --> 00:10.480
elections in each of the states and the candidates with the most votes from

00:10.480 --> 00:14.460
these elections becomes the party's official nominees. These nominees then

00:14.460 --> 00:18.080
face each other in the national election for president. But this isn't the whole

00:18.080 --> 00:21.400
story. There are five things that make it a bit more complicated than that.

00:21.400 --> 00:26.480
Complication number one, primaries versus caucuses. In every state the local party

00:26.480 --> 00:29.480
leaders decide how to run their elections. The two most common choices

00:29.480 --> 00:34.080
are primaries and caucuses. Primaries are just like standard elections. Go to the

00:34.080 --> 00:38.000
polls whenever you can, stand in a long line, hide in a booth, then tick a box or

00:38.000 --> 00:42.080
press a button and your vote is cast in complete anonymity. A caucus however is a

00:42.080 --> 00:45.440
public vote. People gather in groups wherever space is available then

00:45.440 --> 00:48.280
literally take sides in a room with everyone else who likes the same

00:48.280 --> 00:51.920
candidate. The groups debate each other and if people change their minds they

00:51.920 --> 00:55.060
need to physically switch sides. At the end of the debates the party

00:55.060 --> 00:58.060
representatives count the number of people in each group. If you leave too

00:58.060 --> 01:01.620
early your vote doesn't count. This description of primaries and caucuses is

01:01.620 --> 01:05.180
really all you need to know but the specifics can vary wildly. That's because

01:05.180 --> 01:08.300
there are 50 states all of which hold at least two primaries and caucuses for the

01:08.300 --> 01:11.580
big parties and possibly more for the small parties. Covering all the local

01:11.580 --> 01:14.540
variants would take a tediously long time which your short attention span for

01:14.540 --> 01:17.260
boring political videos wouldn't tolerate. And you need to stay focused

01:17.260 --> 01:18.980
because there are four more things to come.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.020
Complication number two, who can vote. In the national presidential election all

01:23.020 --> 01:26.660
American citizens over the age of 18 can vote with two exceptions. You can't

01:26.660 --> 01:30.100
live here or here. But primaries are in-state elections with lots of

01:30.100 --> 01:33.580
different rules. Most states and parties will only let you vote in the primary if

01:33.580 --> 01:37.260
you're an official member of the party. This is called a closed primary because

01:37.260 --> 01:40.540
the voting is closed to non party members. But some citizens are

01:40.540 --> 01:44.100
independents and not registered with any party. If you're an independent and live

01:44.100 --> 01:48.340
in a state with closed party elections, tough luck. No voting for you. Some states

01:48.340 --> 01:51.740
however have semi closed primaries where independents can pick one and only one

01:51.940 --> 01:55.260
primary to vote in. Parties allow this because the presidential election is

01:55.260 --> 01:58.260
often determined by independents so knowing which candidates they like is

01:58.260 --> 01:59.020
useful.

01:59.020 --> 02:02.020
Finally a few states and parties really play it fast and loose with open

02:02.020 --> 02:05.740
primaries. Here any citizen no matter which party they're registered with can

02:05.740 --> 02:08.940
pick a primary to vote in. But it's not just the states that have primaries.

02:08.940 --> 02:11.620
They're also held in the District of Columbia and the off forgotten

02:11.620 --> 02:14.900
territories. Holding primaries here is a bit odd though considering that

02:14.900 --> 02:18.420
territorial residents can't vote in the actual presidential election.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.620
Lastly are the Americans living abroad who depending on the party vote in a

02:21.620 --> 02:25.780
block as though they all live together in one big extra state. When all these

02:25.780 --> 02:27.700
elections take place depends on...

02:27.700 --> 02:31.940
Complication number three. Who votes when? Primaries aren't conducted all at once

02:31.940 --> 02:33.740
but are spread out over a year.

02:33.740 --> 02:36.420
This leads to fights between the states about who gets to be at the head of the

02:36.420 --> 02:38.420
line and who is stuck at the back.

02:38.420 --> 02:41.500
Inevitably last-minute leapfrogging of dates happens even though the parties

02:41.500 --> 02:45.740
often take away votes from these uncivil states. When it comes to being number one

02:45.740 --> 02:48.860
nobody beats New Hampshire who wrote it into state law that their primary will

02:48.860 --> 02:52.020
always be at least a week ahead of everyone else's. Which isn't a problem

02:52.020 --> 02:55.140
until some other state gets the bright idea to do the same and then we have an

02:55.140 --> 02:58.140
infinite loop in our system and have to force quit the law.

02:58.140 --> 03:02.140
But wait you say, doesn't Iowa already go first? Yes but New Hampshire lets them

03:02.140 --> 03:03.980
get away with it for two reasons.

03:03.980 --> 03:07.620
First Iowa's election is a caucus and so New Hampshire is still technically the

03:07.620 --> 03:11.100
first primary and second New Hampshire thinks that Iowa is stupid and doesn't

03:11.100 --> 03:11.900
matter.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.540
Other states try to boost their influence not by cutting in line but by

03:14.540 --> 03:17.860
forming an alliance and holding their primaries at the same time. The biggest

03:17.860 --> 03:21.220
alliance of the election cycle is called Super Tuesday where depending on

03:21.220 --> 03:23.620
how many states can agree with each other around half of them might

03:23.620 --> 03:26.100
participate giving out a whole pile of votes.

03:26.100 --> 03:30.100
Which brings us to complication number four, votes that aren't votes.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.860
So this whole time you were probably thinking that citizens gave votes

03:32.860 --> 03:34.780
straight to the candidates but no.

03:34.780 --> 03:37.740
Instead the votes are given to a bunch of guys called delegates who in turn

03:37.740 --> 03:39.780
give them to the candidates as requested.

03:39.780 --> 03:42.940
Maybe. Depending on the state delegates might be required to vote as the

03:42.940 --> 03:46.100
citizens did or they might be completely free to ignore the citizens and vote for

03:46.140 --> 03:47.380
whomever they want.

03:47.380 --> 03:51.420
Who are these people? The delegates are local party VIPs such as state reps and

03:51.420 --> 03:54.820
officials. The more citizens who live in a state the more delegates that state

03:54.820 --> 03:58.040
gets. Later in the year when all the states have finished their primaries the

03:58.040 --> 04:00.980
delegates travel to a huge gathering for their party called the National

04:00.980 --> 04:01.780
Convention.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.060
It's here that the official vote to select the party's nominee for president

04:05.060 --> 04:08.060
happens. But it's not just the delegates who do the voting.

04:08.060 --> 04:12.380
Complication number five, super delegates. Super delegates are the top members of

04:12.380 --> 04:15.700
the party such as congressmen and former presidents. They go to the National

04:15.700 --> 04:18.660
Convention not to represent the people but to represent the current party

04:18.660 --> 04:21.020
establishment and can vote for whomever they want.

04:21.020 --> 04:24.140
Depending on the party super delegates might be up to 20 percent of the voters

04:24.140 --> 04:27.740
at the National Convention. Usually by the time the National Convention happens

04:27.740 --> 04:30.700
all the candidates save one have dropped out of the race so the convention is

04:30.700 --> 04:34.380
just a rubber stamp and a big party. But if the fight between candidates is still

04:34.380 --> 04:37.220
ongoing the delegates and super delegates are the ones with the final

04:37.220 --> 04:41.060
decision. In summary, over the course of a year the states plus DC plus the

04:41.060 --> 04:44.180
territories and the Americans abroad hold their primaries or caucuses. When

04:44.180 --> 04:46.860
finished the delegates representing the citizens who voted in those elections

04:46.860 --> 04:48.340
travel to the National Convention.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.780
Most of the delegates are forced to vote as the citizens of their state wanted

04:50.780 --> 04:53.380
them to but some of them are free to vote as they like. At the National

04:53.380 --> 04:55.820
Convention the delegates meet up with the super delegates who represent the

04:55.820 --> 04:58.540
best interests of the party and together they make the final decision on who will

04:58.540 --> 05:00.800
be the nominee for president. Tired?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.800
Don't be because only now does the race for the presidency begin.

05:03.800 --> 05:15.920
Of course you could skip all that and jump straight into the election as an

05:15.920 --> 05:19.520
independent. The only downside to this strategy is near certain defeat.
