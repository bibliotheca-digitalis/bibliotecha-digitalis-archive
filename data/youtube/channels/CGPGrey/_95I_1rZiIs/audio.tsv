0	3880	Primary elections are how political parties in the United States pick their
3880	7520	strongest candidate to run for president. The parties do this by holding many
7520	10480	elections in each of the states and the candidates with the most votes from
10480	14460	these elections becomes the party's official nominees. These nominees then
14460	18080	face each other in the national election for president. But this isn't the whole
18080	21400	story. There are five things that make it a bit more complicated than that.
21400	26480	Complication number one, primaries versus caucuses. In every state the local party
26480	29480	leaders decide how to run their elections. The two most common choices
29480	34080	are primaries and caucuses. Primaries are just like standard elections. Go to the
34080	38000	polls whenever you can, stand in a long line, hide in a booth, then tick a box or
38000	42080	press a button and your vote is cast in complete anonymity. A caucus however is a
42080	45440	public vote. People gather in groups wherever space is available then
45440	48280	literally take sides in a room with everyone else who likes the same
48280	51920	candidate. The groups debate each other and if people change their minds they
51920	55060	need to physically switch sides. At the end of the debates the party
55060	58060	representatives count the number of people in each group. If you leave too
58060	61620	early your vote doesn't count. This description of primaries and caucuses is
61620	65180	really all you need to know but the specifics can vary wildly. That's because
65180	68300	there are 50 states all of which hold at least two primaries and caucuses for the
68300	71580	big parties and possibly more for the small parties. Covering all the local
71580	74540	variants would take a tediously long time which your short attention span for
74540	77260	boring political videos wouldn't tolerate. And you need to stay focused
77260	78980	because there are four more things to come.
78980	83020	Complication number two, who can vote. In the national presidential election all
83020	86660	American citizens over the age of 18 can vote with two exceptions. You can't
86660	90100	live here or here. But primaries are in-state elections with lots of
90100	93580	different rules. Most states and parties will only let you vote in the primary if
93580	97260	you're an official member of the party. This is called a closed primary because
97260	100540	the voting is closed to non party members. But some citizens are
100540	104100	independents and not registered with any party. If you're an independent and live
104100	108340	in a state with closed party elections, tough luck. No voting for you. Some states
108340	111740	however have semi closed primaries where independents can pick one and only one
111940	115260	primary to vote in. Parties allow this because the presidential election is
115260	118260	often determined by independents so knowing which candidates they like is
118260	119020	useful.
119020	122020	Finally a few states and parties really play it fast and loose with open
122020	125740	primaries. Here any citizen no matter which party they're registered with can
125740	128940	pick a primary to vote in. But it's not just the states that have primaries.
128940	131620	They're also held in the District of Columbia and the off forgotten
131620	134900	territories. Holding primaries here is a bit odd though considering that
134900	138420	territorial residents can't vote in the actual presidential election.
138420	141620	Lastly are the Americans living abroad who depending on the party vote in a
141620	145780	block as though they all live together in one big extra state. When all these
145780	147700	elections take place depends on...
147700	151940	Complication number three. Who votes when? Primaries aren't conducted all at once
151940	153740	but are spread out over a year.
153740	156420	This leads to fights between the states about who gets to be at the head of the
156420	158420	line and who is stuck at the back.
158420	161500	Inevitably last-minute leapfrogging of dates happens even though the parties
161500	165740	often take away votes from these uncivil states. When it comes to being number one
165740	168860	nobody beats New Hampshire who wrote it into state law that their primary will
168860	172020	always be at least a week ahead of everyone else's. Which isn't a problem
172020	175140	until some other state gets the bright idea to do the same and then we have an
175140	178140	infinite loop in our system and have to force quit the law.
178140	182140	But wait you say, doesn't Iowa already go first? Yes but New Hampshire lets them
182140	183980	get away with it for two reasons.
183980	187620	First Iowa's election is a caucus and so New Hampshire is still technically the
187620	191100	first primary and second New Hampshire thinks that Iowa is stupid and doesn't
191100	191900	matter.
191900	194540	Other states try to boost their influence not by cutting in line but by
194540	197860	forming an alliance and holding their primaries at the same time. The biggest
197860	201220	alliance of the election cycle is called Super Tuesday where depending on
201220	203620	how many states can agree with each other around half of them might
203620	206100	participate giving out a whole pile of votes.
206100	210100	Which brings us to complication number four, votes that aren't votes.
210100	212860	So this whole time you were probably thinking that citizens gave votes
212860	214780	straight to the candidates but no.
214780	217740	Instead the votes are given to a bunch of guys called delegates who in turn
217740	219780	give them to the candidates as requested.
219780	222940	Maybe. Depending on the state delegates might be required to vote as the
222940	226100	citizens did or they might be completely free to ignore the citizens and vote for
226140	227380	whomever they want.
227380	231420	Who are these people? The delegates are local party VIPs such as state reps and
231420	234820	officials. The more citizens who live in a state the more delegates that state
234820	238040	gets. Later in the year when all the states have finished their primaries the
238040	240980	delegates travel to a huge gathering for their party called the National
240980	241780	Convention.
241780	245060	It's here that the official vote to select the party's nominee for president
245060	248060	happens. But it's not just the delegates who do the voting.
248060	252380	Complication number five, super delegates. Super delegates are the top members of
252380	255700	the party such as congressmen and former presidents. They go to the National
255700	258660	Convention not to represent the people but to represent the current party
258660	261020	establishment and can vote for whomever they want.
261020	264140	Depending on the party super delegates might be up to 20 percent of the voters
264140	267740	at the National Convention. Usually by the time the National Convention happens
267740	270700	all the candidates save one have dropped out of the race so the convention is
270700	274380	just a rubber stamp and a big party. But if the fight between candidates is still
274380	277220	ongoing the delegates and super delegates are the ones with the final
277220	281060	decision. In summary, over the course of a year the states plus DC plus the
281060	284180	territories and the Americans abroad hold their primaries or caucuses. When
284180	286860	finished the delegates representing the citizens who voted in those elections
286860	288340	travel to the National Convention.
288340	290780	Most of the delegates are forced to vote as the citizens of their state wanted
290780	293380	them to but some of them are free to vote as they like. At the National
293380	295820	Convention the delegates meet up with the super delegates who represent the
295820	298540	best interests of the party and together they make the final decision on who will
298540	300800	be the nominee for president. Tired?
300800	303800	Don't be because only now does the race for the presidency begin.
303800	315920	Of course you could skip all that and jump straight into the election as an
315920	319520	independent. The only downside to this strategy is near certain defeat.
