1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
Number 8.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
Let's talk about lemmings.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,440
When you hear the word lemmings you might think of two things.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,720
This video game and some sort of small creature that suicidally leaps off cliffs when its

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,400
population grows too large.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,060
In case you didn't know, lemmings are real and adorable and not suicidal.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,060
The origin of this myth is a bit unclear but the video game lemmings may have done a lot

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,440
to convince a younger generation that lemmings are willfully suicidal and extremely frustrating

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,240
to micromanage thus deserving of mass extermination.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Number 7.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Daddy Long Legs.

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Many things have earned their reputation as the most poisonous of any spider.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,920
But they're also pretty common so you might wonder why more people don't die of daddy

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,520
long leg bites every year.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
Like a good conspiracy theory, this myth covers its own tracks by saying that their fangs

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,520
are too small to penetrate human skin.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,420
You could score one for team human except that this misconception is a triple whammy

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
of wrongness.

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,120
One, daddy long legs don't have fangs because two, they don't produce venom because three,

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,440
they aren't even spiders.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Number 6.

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Ostrichs.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Let's review the properties of these flightless birds, shall we?

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,800
They're up to 9 feet tall, up to 340 pounds, aggressive, with sharp beaks and long claws.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,520
Essentially, an ostrich is the closest thing to a living raptor you're ever going to see.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
That is until our genetic engineering technology gets better.

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Come on, dino-pocalypse.

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,100
Anyway, keeping these facts in mind, if you decide to threaten an ostrich, do you really

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,440
think it's going to stick its head in the sand and wait to die?

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,560
No, of course not.

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,540
If you're lucky, it'll run away at 40 miles an hour and if you're not, it's fatality time

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,540
for you.

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,040
Ostrichs have no reason to hide and especially not in the stupidest way ever.

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,660
If they did, they would have survived about as long as another species of flightless bird.

35
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,240
While we're talking about flightless birds...

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Number 5.

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Baby Birds.

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,360
Don't abandon her baby because you've touched it any more than a human mother would abandon

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,080
her baby if a bird touched it.

40
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,220
If you find a baby bird and can easily reach its nest, it's perfectly fine to put it back.

41
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,220
Number 4.

42
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,220
Goldfish Memory.

43
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,500
Goldfish do have memories longer than 3 seconds or 7 seconds or whatever other made up number

44
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,040
always accompanies this fact.

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,500
They can actually be trained and will remember what they've learned for months, which is

46
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,960
more than can be said for many humans.

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,840
On an unrelated note, goldfish are also delicious.

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Number 3.

49
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Dog Vision.

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Poor dogs, forever living in their sad, monochrome worlds.

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Except they don't.

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Most humans do see color, but not quite like us.

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,920
Most humans see three primary colors, red, blue and green, but dogs are limited to two.

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,240
They can see blues, but the rest of the color spectrum they can't tell apart.

55
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,140
Which they don't mind until you buy them a red toy and throw it into the green grass

56
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,240
and act like they're stupid for not finding it.

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,580
It's easy for you to see because your ancestors spent several million years foraging for red

58
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,080
objects on a green background and so got quite good at it.

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Unless they didn't, which in that case they died.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
But canine eyes are not monkey eyes and so to your dog if it isn't blue it's all the

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
same color.

62
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,560
So next time you're at the pet store, get Rover a blue toy.

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,840
And while we're talking about vision, let's talk about bats.

64
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,520
Which if you've ever looked at one, it should be immediately obvious that they're not

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,040
blind because they look right back at you, with their eyes, that they use to see things.

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,980
But they do one better by having an additional sense called echolocation that allows them

67
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,200
to navigate the world in complete darkness.

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,440
Something you can't do.

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,480
So from the bats perspective, you're the blind one.

70
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Number 1.

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,960
You can boil a frog to death if you do it very slowly.

72
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,760
This one is true, sort of.

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,900
Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog will remain blithely in a pot of water, brought

74
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,340
to boil if the temperature is raised slowly enough.

75
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,780
However, the rather salient fact that is often left out of the retelling is that Goltz cut

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,720
out the frog's brains before placing them in the pot, which rather puts the frog at

77
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,220
a disadvantage.

78
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,660
Goltz also showed that if you don't lobotomize the frog first, then surprise, it jumps out

79
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,660
of the pot.

80
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,660
It seems likely, but please don't try this at home, that removing the brain of any animal

81
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,900
would rather hinder their instinct of self-preservation, and also make them more gullible about common

82
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:33,820
misconceptions.
