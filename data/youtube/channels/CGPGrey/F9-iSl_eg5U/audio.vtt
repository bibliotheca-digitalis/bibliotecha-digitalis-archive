00:00.000 --> 00:05.080
Number 8.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.080
Let's talk about lemmings.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.440
When you hear the word lemmings you might think of two things.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.720
This video game and some sort of small creature that suicidally leaps off cliffs when its

00:11.720 --> 00:13.400
population grows too large.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.060
In case you didn't know, lemmings are real and adorable and not suicidal.

00:17.060 --> 00:20.060
The origin of this myth is a bit unclear but the video game lemmings may have done a lot

00:20.060 --> 00:23.440
to convince a younger generation that lemmings are willfully suicidal and extremely frustrating

00:23.440 --> 00:26.240
to micromanage thus deserving of mass extermination.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.240
Number 7.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.240
Daddy Long Legs.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.280
Many things have earned their reputation as the most poisonous of any spider.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.920
But they're also pretty common so you might wonder why more people don't die of daddy

00:33.920 --> 00:35.520
long leg bites every year.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.560
Like a good conspiracy theory, this myth covers its own tracks by saying that their fangs

00:38.560 --> 00:40.520
are too small to penetrate human skin.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.420
You could score one for team human except that this misconception is a triple whammy

00:43.420 --> 00:44.420
of wrongness.

00:44.420 --> 00:48.120
One, daddy long legs don't have fangs because two, they don't produce venom because three,

00:48.120 --> 00:49.440
they aren't even spiders.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
Number 6.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.440
Ostrichs.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.440
Let's review the properties of these flightless birds, shall we?

00:53.440 --> 00:57.800
They're up to 9 feet tall, up to 340 pounds, aggressive, with sharp beaks and long claws.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.520
Essentially, an ostrich is the closest thing to a living raptor you're ever going to see.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.520
That is until our genetic engineering technology gets better.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.520
Come on, dino-pocalypse.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.100
Anyway, keeping these facts in mind, if you decide to threaten an ostrich, do you really

01:08.100 --> 01:10.440
think it's going to stick its head in the sand and wait to die?

01:10.440 --> 01:11.560
No, of course not.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.540
If you're lucky, it'll run away at 40 miles an hour and if you're not, it's fatality time

01:15.540 --> 01:16.540
for you.

01:16.540 --> 01:20.040
Ostrichs have no reason to hide and especially not in the stupidest way ever.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.660
If they did, they would have survived about as long as another species of flightless bird.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.240
While we're talking about flightless birds...

01:25.240 --> 01:26.240
Number 5.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.240
Baby Birds.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.360
Don't abandon her baby because you've touched it any more than a human mother would abandon

01:30.360 --> 01:32.080
her baby if a bird touched it.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.220
If you find a baby bird and can easily reach its nest, it's perfectly fine to put it back.

01:36.220 --> 01:37.220
Number 4.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.220
Goldfish Memory.

01:38.220 --> 01:41.500
Goldfish do have memories longer than 3 seconds or 7 seconds or whatever other made up number

01:41.500 --> 01:43.040
always accompanies this fact.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.500
They can actually be trained and will remember what they've learned for months, which is

01:45.500 --> 01:46.960
more than can be said for many humans.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.840
On an unrelated note, goldfish are also delicious.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.840
Number 3.

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
Dog Vision.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.680
Poor dogs, forever living in their sad, monochrome worlds.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
Except they don't.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.760
Most humans do see color, but not quite like us.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.920
Most humans see three primary colors, red, blue and green, but dogs are limited to two.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.240
They can see blues, but the rest of the color spectrum they can't tell apart.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.140
Which they don't mind until you buy them a red toy and throw it into the green grass

02:08.140 --> 02:10.240
and act like they're stupid for not finding it.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.580
It's easy for you to see because your ancestors spent several million years foraging for red

02:13.580 --> 02:16.080
objects on a green background and so got quite good at it.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.000
Unless they didn't, which in that case they died.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.120
But canine eyes are not monkey eyes and so to your dog if it isn't blue it's all the

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
same color.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.560
So next time you're at the pet store, get Rover a blue toy.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.840
And while we're talking about vision, let's talk about bats.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.520
Which if you've ever looked at one, it should be immediately obvious that they're not

02:29.520 --> 02:34.040
blind because they look right back at you, with their eyes, that they use to see things.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.980
But they do one better by having an additional sense called echolocation that allows them

02:36.980 --> 02:39.200
to navigate the world in complete darkness.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.440
Something you can't do.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.480
So from the bats perspective, you're the blind one.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.480
Number 1.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.960
You can boil a frog to death if you do it very slowly.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.760
This one is true, sort of.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.900
Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog will remain blithely in a pot of water, brought

02:51.900 --> 02:54.340
to boil if the temperature is raised slowly enough.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.780
However, the rather salient fact that is often left out of the retelling is that Goltz cut

02:57.780 --> 03:01.720
out the frog's brains before placing them in the pot, which rather puts the frog at

03:01.720 --> 03:03.220
a disadvantage.

03:03.220 --> 03:06.660
Goltz also showed that if you don't lobotomize the frog first, then surprise, it jumps out

03:06.660 --> 03:07.660
of the pot.

03:07.660 --> 03:10.660
It seems likely, but please don't try this at home, that removing the brain of any animal

03:10.660 --> 03:14.900
would rather hinder their instinct of self-preservation, and also make them more gullible about common

03:14.900 --> 03:33.820
misconceptions.
