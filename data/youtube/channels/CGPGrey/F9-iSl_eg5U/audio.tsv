0	5080	Number 8.
5080	6080	Let's talk about lemmings.
6080	8440	When you hear the word lemmings you might think of two things.
8440	11720	This video game and some sort of small creature that suicidally leaps off cliffs when its
11720	13400	population grows too large.
13400	17060	In case you didn't know, lemmings are real and adorable and not suicidal.
17060	20060	The origin of this myth is a bit unclear but the video game lemmings may have done a lot
20060	23440	to convince a younger generation that lemmings are willfully suicidal and extremely frustrating
23440	26240	to micromanage thus deserving of mass extermination.
26240	27240	Number 7.
27240	28240	Daddy Long Legs.
28280	31280	Many things have earned their reputation as the most poisonous of any spider.
31280	33920	But they're also pretty common so you might wonder why more people don't die of daddy
33920	35520	long leg bites every year.
35520	38560	Like a good conspiracy theory, this myth covers its own tracks by saying that their fangs
38560	40520	are too small to penetrate human skin.
40520	43420	You could score one for team human except that this misconception is a triple whammy
43420	44420	of wrongness.
44420	48120	One, daddy long legs don't have fangs because two, they don't produce venom because three,
48120	49440	they aren't even spiders.
49440	50440	Number 6.
50440	51440	Ostrichs.
51440	53440	Let's review the properties of these flightless birds, shall we?
53440	57800	They're up to 9 feet tall, up to 340 pounds, aggressive, with sharp beaks and long claws.
57800	61520	Essentially, an ostrich is the closest thing to a living raptor you're ever going to see.
61520	63520	That is until our genetic engineering technology gets better.
63520	64520	Come on, dino-pocalypse.
64520	68100	Anyway, keeping these facts in mind, if you decide to threaten an ostrich, do you really
68100	70440	think it's going to stick its head in the sand and wait to die?
70440	71560	No, of course not.
71560	75540	If you're lucky, it'll run away at 40 miles an hour and if you're not, it's fatality time
75540	76540	for you.
76540	80040	Ostrichs have no reason to hide and especially not in the stupidest way ever.
80040	83660	If they did, they would have survived about as long as another species of flightless bird.
83660	85240	While we're talking about flightless birds...
85240	86240	Number 5.
86240	87240	Baby Birds.
87680	90360	Don't abandon her baby because you've touched it any more than a human mother would abandon
90360	92080	her baby if a bird touched it.
92080	96220	If you find a baby bird and can easily reach its nest, it's perfectly fine to put it back.
96220	97220	Number 4.
97220	98220	Goldfish Memory.
98220	101500	Goldfish do have memories longer than 3 seconds or 7 seconds or whatever other made up number
101500	103040	always accompanies this fact.
103040	105500	They can actually be trained and will remember what they've learned for months, which is
105500	106960	more than can be said for many humans.
106960	109840	On an unrelated note, goldfish are also delicious.
109840	110840	Number 3.
110840	111840	Dog Vision.
111840	114680	Poor dogs, forever living in their sad, monochrome worlds.
114680	115680	Except they don't.
115680	117760	Most humans do see color, but not quite like us.
117760	121920	Most humans see three primary colors, red, blue and green, but dogs are limited to two.
121920	125240	They can see blues, but the rest of the color spectrum they can't tell apart.
125240	128140	Which they don't mind until you buy them a red toy and throw it into the green grass
128140	130240	and act like they're stupid for not finding it.
130240	133580	It's easy for you to see because your ancestors spent several million years foraging for red
133580	136080	objects on a green background and so got quite good at it.
136080	138000	Unless they didn't, which in that case they died.
138000	141120	But canine eyes are not monkey eyes and so to your dog if it isn't blue it's all the
141120	142120	same color.
142120	144560	So next time you're at the pet store, get Rover a blue toy.
144560	146840	And while we're talking about vision, let's talk about bats.
146840	149520	Which if you've ever looked at one, it should be immediately obvious that they're not
149520	154040	blind because they look right back at you, with their eyes, that they use to see things.
154040	156980	But they do one better by having an additional sense called echolocation that allows them
156980	159200	to navigate the world in complete darkness.
159200	160440	Something you can't do.
160440	163480	So from the bats perspective, you're the blind one.
163480	164480	Number 1.
164480	166960	You can boil a frog to death if you do it very slowly.
166960	168760	This one is true, sort of.
168760	171900	Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog will remain blithely in a pot of water, brought
171900	174340	to boil if the temperature is raised slowly enough.
174340	177780	However, the rather salient fact that is often left out of the retelling is that Goltz cut
177780	181720	out the frog's brains before placing them in the pot, which rather puts the frog at
181720	183220	a disadvantage.
183220	186660	Goltz also showed that if you don't lobotomize the frog first, then surprise, it jumps out
186660	187660	of the pot.
187660	190660	It seems likely, but please don't try this at home, that removing the brain of any animal
190660	194900	would rather hinder their instinct of self-preservation, and also make them more gullible about common
194900	213820	misconceptions.
