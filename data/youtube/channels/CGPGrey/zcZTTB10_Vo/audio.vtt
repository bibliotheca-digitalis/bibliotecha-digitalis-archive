00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Not once, not twice, but thrice in American history, the candidate with the most votes from the people actually lost because of the electoral college.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Four times now. This has happened four times.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Three errors in 55 plus elections is a failure rate of 5%.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
7%

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Would anyone tolerate a sport where, by a quirk of the rules, there was a

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
7%

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
chance that the loser would win? Not likely.
