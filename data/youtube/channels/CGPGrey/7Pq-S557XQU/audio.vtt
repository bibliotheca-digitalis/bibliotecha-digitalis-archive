00:00.000 --> 00:08.940
Every human used to have to hunt or gather to survive, but humans are smartly lazy, so

00:08.940 --> 00:11.740
we made tools to make our work easier.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.420
From sticks to plows to tractors, we've gone from everyone needing to make food to

00:15.420 --> 00:19.100
modern agriculture with almost no one needing to make food.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.300
And yet we still have abundance.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.120
Of course, it's not just farming, it's everything.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.960
We've spent the last several thousand years building tools to reduce physical labor of

00:26.960 --> 00:28.300
all kinds.

00:28.300 --> 00:33.120
These are mechanical muscles, stronger, more reliable, and more tireless than human muscles

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
ever could be.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.120
And that's a good thing.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.560
Replacing human labor with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize, and that leaves

00:39.560 --> 00:43.300
everyone better off, even those still doing physical labor.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.560
This is how economies grow and standards of living rise.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.160
Some people have specialized to be programmers and engineers whose job is to build mechanical

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
minds.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.380
Just as mechanical muscles made human labor less in demand, so are mechanical minds making

00:56.380 --> 00:59.060
human brain labor less in demand.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.720
This is an economic revolution.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.760
You may think we've been here before, but we haven't.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.080
This time is different.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.840
When you think of automation, you probably think of this.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.760
Giant, custom-built, expensive, efficient, but really dumb robots blind to the world

01:14.760 --> 01:15.920
and their own work.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.820
They were a scary kind of automation, but they haven't taken over the world because

01:19.820 --> 01:23.280
they're only cost-effective in narrow situations.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.600
But they're the old kind of automation.

01:25.620 --> 01:27.180
This is the new kind.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.300
Meet Baxter.

01:28.300 --> 01:32.020
Unlike these things, which require skilled operators and technicians and millions of

01:32.020 --> 01:37.020
dollars, Baxter has vision and can learn what you want him to do by watching you do it.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.780
And he costs less than the average annual salary of a human worker.

01:40.780 --> 01:44.760
Unlike his older brothers, he isn't pre-programmed for one specific job.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.100
He can do whatever work is within the reach of his arms.

01:48.100 --> 01:52.660
Baxter is what might be thought of as a general purpose robot, and general purpose is a big

01:52.660 --> 01:53.660
deal.

01:53.660 --> 01:54.660
Think computers.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.440
22 started out as highly custom and highly expensive, but when cheap-ish general purpose

01:59.440 --> 02:02.600
computers appeared, they quickly became vital to everything.

02:02.600 --> 02:07.460
A general purpose computer can just as easily calculate change or assign seats on an airplane

02:07.460 --> 02:11.520
or play a game or do anything just by swapping its software.

02:11.520 --> 02:16.320
And this huge demand for computers of all kinds is what makes them both more powerful

02:16.320 --> 02:18.200
and cheaper every year.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.040
Baxter today is the computer of the 1980s.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.320
He's not the apex, but the beginning.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.940
If Baxter is slow, his hourly cost is pennies worth of electricity while his meat-based

02:27.940 --> 02:30.100
competition costs minimum wage.

02:30.100 --> 02:34.260
A tenth of the speed is still cost-effective when it's a hundredth the price.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.380
And while Baxter isn't as smart as some of the other things we will talk about, he's

02:37.380 --> 02:40.540
smart enough to take over many low-skilled jobs.

02:40.540 --> 02:44.300
And we've already seen how dumber robots than Baxter can replace jobs.

02:44.300 --> 02:50.500
In new supermarkets, what used to be 30 humans is now one human overseeing 30 cashier robots.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.500
Or take the hundreds of thousands of baristas employed worldwide, there's a barista robot

02:54.500 --> 02:55.500
coming for them.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.480
Sure, maybe your guy makes the double mocha whatever just perfect and you'd never trust

02:59.480 --> 03:04.480
anyone else, but millions of people don't care and just want a decent cup of coffee.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.780
Oh, and by the way, this robot is actually a giant network of robots that remembers who

03:08.780 --> 03:12.320
you are and how you like your coffee no matter where you are.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Pretty convenient.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.640
We think of technological change as the fancy new expensive stuff, but the real change comes

03:17.640 --> 03:20.920
from last decade stuff getting cheaper and faster.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.120
That's what's happening to robots now.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.220
And because their mechanical minds are capable of decision-making, they are out-competing

03:27.220 --> 03:33.660
humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical muscle ever could.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.620
Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s talking about technology.

03:37.620 --> 03:41.160
One worries all these new mechanical muscles will make horses unnecessary.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.260
The other reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.540
Remember all that farm work?

03:46.540 --> 03:48.780
Remember running from coast to coast delivering mail?

03:48.780 --> 03:50.380
Remember riding into battle?

03:50.380 --> 03:51.440
All terrible.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.180
These new city jobs are pretty cushy and with so many humans in the cities there will be

03:55.180 --> 03:57.420
more jobs for horses than ever.

03:57.420 --> 04:01.860
Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we

04:01.860 --> 04:02.860
can't imagine.

04:02.860 --> 04:06.600
But you, dear viewer from beyond 2000, know what happened.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.900
There are still working horses, but nothing like before.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.440
The horse population peaked in 1915.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.180
From that point on, it was nothing but down.

04:15.180 --> 04:19.100
There isn't a rule of economics that says better technology makes more better jobs for

04:19.100 --> 04:20.100
horses.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.100
It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud.

04:23.100 --> 04:27.420
But swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.

04:27.420 --> 04:31.480
As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of the economy, mechanical minds will do the

04:31.480 --> 04:32.900
same to humans.

04:32.900 --> 04:37.660
Not immediately, not everywhere, but in large enough numbers and soon enough that it's going

04:37.660 --> 04:40.940
to be a huge problem if we're not prepared.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.220
And we're not prepared.

04:42.260 --> 04:45.980
You, like the second horse, may look at the state of technology now and think it can't

04:45.980 --> 04:47.780
possibly replace your job.

04:47.780 --> 04:52.280
But technology gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate biology can't match.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.340
Just as the car was the beginning of the end for the horse, so now does the car show us

04:56.340 --> 04:58.220
the shape of things to come.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.580
Self-driving cars aren't the future.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.580
They're here and they work.

05:05.580 --> 05:08.600
Self-driving cars have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles up and down the California

05:08.600 --> 05:12.200
coast and through cities all without human intervention.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.740
The question is not if they'll replace cars, but how quickly.

05:15.740 --> 05:19.320
They don't need to be perfect, they just need to be better than us.

05:19.320 --> 05:25.040
Human drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a year with cars just in the United States.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.640
Given that self-driving cars don't blink, don't text while driving, don't get sleepy

05:28.640 --> 05:33.760
or stupid, it's easy to see them being better than humans because they already are.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.960
Now to describe self-driving cars as cars at all is like calling the first cars mechanical

05:38.960 --> 05:39.960
horses.

05:39.960 --> 05:44.620
Cars in all their forms are so much more than horses that using the name limits your thinking

05:44.620 --> 05:46.760
about what they can even do.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.280
Let's call self-driving cars what they really are.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.560
Autos, the solution to the transport objects from point A to point B problem.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.740
Traditional cars happen to be human-sized to transport humans, but tiny autos can work

05:57.740 --> 06:00.760
in warehouses and gigantic autos can work in pit mines.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.200
Moving stuff around is who knows how many jobs, but the transportation industry in the

06:05.200 --> 06:08.240
United States employs about 3 million people.

06:08.240 --> 06:13.460
Trampolating worldwide, that's something like 70 million jobs at a minimum.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.260
These jobs are over.

06:15.260 --> 06:19.240
The usual argument is that the unions will prevent it, but history is filled with workers

06:19.240 --> 06:25.080
who fought technology that would replace them and the workers always lose, economics always

06:25.080 --> 06:30.380
wins, and there are huge incentives across wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.

06:30.380 --> 06:34.760
For many transportation companies, humans are about a third their total costs.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.680
That's just the straight salaries.

06:36.680 --> 06:41.160
Autos sleeping in their long-haul trucks cost time and money, accidents cost money, carelessness

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
costs money.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.060
If you think insurance companies will be against it, guess what?

06:45.060 --> 06:50.080
Their perfect driver is one who pays their small premiums and never gets into an accident.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.080
The autos are coming and they're the first place where most people will really see the

06:54.080 --> 06:58.480
robots changing society, but there are many other places in the economy where the same

06:58.480 --> 07:00.840
thing is happening, just less visibly.

07:00.840 --> 07:07.160
So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.720
It's easy to look at autos and backsters and think, technology has always gotten rid of

07:10.720 --> 07:13.800
low-skilled jobs we don't want people doing anyway.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.880
They'll get more skilled and do better-educated jobs like they've always done.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.480
Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred million additional people through higher education,

07:22.480 --> 07:25.160
white-collar work is no safe haven either.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.060
If your job is sitting in front of a screen and typing and clicking, like maybe you're

07:29.060 --> 07:32.860
supposed to be doing right now, the bots are coming for you too, buddy.

07:32.860 --> 07:37.600
Software bots are both intangible and way faster and cheaper than physical robots.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.340
Given that white-collar workers are, from a company's perspective, both more expensive

07:41.340 --> 07:46.140
and more numerous, the incentive to automate their work is greater than low-skilled work.

07:46.140 --> 07:49.540
And that's just what automation engineers are for.

07:49.540 --> 07:54.220
These are skilled programmers whose entire job is to replace your job with a software

07:54.220 --> 07:55.220
bot.

07:55.220 --> 07:58.940
You may think even the world's smartest automation engineer could never make a bot to do your

07:58.940 --> 08:03.660
job and you may be right, but the cutting edge of programming isn't super smart programmers

08:03.660 --> 08:08.580
writing bots, it's super smart programmers writing bots that teach themselves how to

08:08.580 --> 08:11.740
do things the programmer could never teach them to do.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.520
How that works is well beyond the scope of this video, but the bottom line is there are

08:15.520 --> 08:20.060
limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done

08:20.060 --> 08:23.960
stuff and it can figure out how to do the job to be done.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.880
Even with just a goal and no knowledge of how to do it, the bots can still learn.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.380
Take the stock market, which in many ways is no longer a human endeavor.

08:32.380 --> 08:36.720
It's mostly bots that taught themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks with other bots

08:36.720 --> 08:38.280
that taught themselves.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.880
As a result, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange isn't filled with traders doing

08:41.880 --> 08:44.960
their day jobs anymore, it's largely a TV set.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.000
So bots have learned the market and bots have learned to write.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.320
If you've picked up a newspaper lately, you've probably already read a story written

08:51.320 --> 08:52.380
by a bot.

08:52.380 --> 08:56.780
There are companies that teach bots to write anything, sports stories, TPS reports, even

08:56.780 --> 08:59.820
say those quarterly reports that you write at work.

08:59.820 --> 09:03.900
Paperwork, decision making, writing, a lot of human work falls into that category and

09:03.900 --> 09:08.540
the demand for human mental labor in these areas is on the way down.

09:08.540 --> 09:15.640
But surely the professions are still safe from bots, yes?

09:15.640 --> 09:19.880
When you think lawyer, it's easy to think of trials, but the bulk of lawyering is actually

09:19.880 --> 09:24.380
drafting legal documents, predicting the likely outcome and impact of lawsuits and something

09:24.380 --> 09:28.740
called discovery, which is where boxes of paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they

09:28.740 --> 09:32.620
need to find the pattern or the one out of place transaction among it all.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.420
This can be bot work.

09:34.420 --> 09:38.700
Discovery in particular is already not a human job in many law firms.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.100
Not because there isn't paperwork to go through, there's more of it than ever, but

09:42.100 --> 09:46.020
because clever research bots shift through millions of emails and memos and accounts

09:46.020 --> 09:51.620
in hours, not weeks, crushing human researchers in terms of not just cost and time, but most

09:51.620 --> 09:53.740
importantly, accuracy.

09:53.740 --> 09:56.860
Just don't get sleepy reading through a million emails.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.180
But that's the simple stuff.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.300
IBM has a bot named Watson.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.400
You may have seen him on TV destroy humans at Jeopardy, but that was just a fun side

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
project for him.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.800
Watson's day job is to be the best doctor in the world, to understand what people say

10:09.800 --> 10:13.180
in their own words and give back accurate diagnoses.

10:13.180 --> 10:17.700
He's already doing that at Sloan Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer treatments.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.500
Just as autos don't need to be perfect, they just need to make fewer mistakes than

10:21.500 --> 10:23.940
The same goes for doctor bots.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.700
Human doctors are by no means perfect.

10:25.700 --> 10:30.720
The frequency and severity of misdiagnoses are terrifying, and human doctors are severely

10:30.720 --> 10:34.940
limited in dealing with a human's complicated medical history.

10:34.940 --> 10:39.060
Understanding every drug and every drug's interaction with every other drug is beyond

10:39.060 --> 10:41.020
the scope of human knowability.

10:41.020 --> 10:45.180
Especially when there are research robots whose whole job it is to test thousands of

10:45.180 --> 10:46.820
new drugs at a time.

10:46.820 --> 10:50.400
And human doctors can only improve through their own experiences.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.760
Doctor bots can learn from the experience of every doctor bot, can read the latest in

10:53.760 --> 10:57.760
medical research and keep track of everything that happens to all their patients worldwide

10:57.760 --> 11:01.760
and make correlations that would be impossible to find otherwise.

11:01.760 --> 11:06.340
Not all doctors will go away, but when the doctor bots are comparable to humans and they're

11:06.340 --> 11:10.920
only as far away as your phone, the need for general doctors will be less.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.240
So professionals, white collar workers and low skill workers all have things to worry

11:15.240 --> 11:16.920
about from automation.

11:16.920 --> 11:21.440
Perhaps you are unphased because you're a special creative snowflake.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
Well guess what?

11:22.440 --> 11:28.160
You're not that special.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.640
Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn't.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.920
The brain is a complicated machine, perhaps the most complicated machine in the whole

11:34.920 --> 11:38.160
universe, but that hasn't stopped us from trying to simulate it.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.120
There is this notion that just as mechanical muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs,

11:42.120 --> 11:45.600
that mechanical minds will allow us to move into creative work.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.800
But even if we assume the human mind is magically creative, it's not, but just for the sake

11:49.800 --> 11:54.620
of argument, artistic creativity isn't what the majority of jobs depend on.

11:54.620 --> 11:58.260
The number of writers and poets and directors and actors and artists who actually make a

11:58.260 --> 12:02.720
living doing their work is a tiny, tiny portion of the labor force.

12:02.720 --> 12:07.380
And given that these are professions dependent on popularity, they'll always be a very small

12:07.380 --> 12:08.760
portion of the population.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.680
There can't be such a thing as a poem and painting based economy.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.360
Oh, by the way, this music in the background that you're listening to?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.640
It was written by a bot.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.440
Her name is Emily Howell and she can write an infinite amount of new music all day for

12:21.440 --> 12:22.440
free.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.160
And people can't tell the difference between her and human composers when put to a blind

12:26.160 --> 12:27.160
test.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.960
Talking about artificial creativity gets weird fast, what does that even mean, but nonetheless

12:31.960 --> 12:33.800
it's a developing field.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.280
People used to think that playing chess was a uniquely creative human skill that machines

12:37.280 --> 12:40.840
could never do, right up until the point they beat the best of us.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.400
So it will go for all human talents.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.200
Right, this may have been a lot to take in and you might want to reject it.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.920
It's easy to be cynical of the endless and idiotic predictions of futures that never

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
are.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.760
So that's why it's important to emphasize again that this stuff isn't science fiction.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.840
The robots are here right now.

13:01.840 --> 13:07.460
There is a terrifying amount of working automation in labs and warehouses around the world.

13:07.460 --> 13:12.740
We have been through economic revolutions before, but the robot revolution is different.

13:12.740 --> 13:17.980
Horses aren't unemployed now because they got lazy as a species, they're unemployable.

13:17.980 --> 13:21.860
There's little work that a horse can do to pay for its housing and hay.

13:21.860 --> 13:26.620
And many bright, perfectly capable humans will find themselves the new horse, unemployable

13:26.620 --> 13:28.580
through no fault of their own.

13:28.580 --> 13:32.780
But if you still think new jobs will save us, here is one final point to consider.

13:32.780 --> 13:37.240
The US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds of jobs.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.660
Now there are hundreds of kinds of jobs, but the new ones are not a significant part

13:41.660 --> 13:42.880
of the labor force.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.200
Here's the list of jobs ranked by the number of people who perform them.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.880
It's a sobering list with the transportation industry at the top.

13:49.880 --> 13:55.480
Continuing downward, all of this work existed in some form a hundred years ago and almost

13:55.480 --> 13:58.460
all of them are easy targets for automation.

13:58.460 --> 14:02.640
Only when we get to number 33 on the list is there finally something new.

14:02.640 --> 14:06.560
Don't think that every barista or white collar worker need lose their job before things are

14:06.560 --> 14:07.560
a problem.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.820
The unemployment rate during the Great Depression was 25%.

14:10.820 --> 14:14.920
The list above is 45% of the workforce.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.440
Just what we've talked about today, the stuff that already works, can push us over that

14:19.440 --> 14:21.080
number pretty soon.

14:21.080 --> 14:26.440
And given that even in our modern technological wonderland, new kinds of work aren't a significant

14:26.440 --> 14:29.980
portion of the economy, this is a big problem.

14:29.980 --> 14:34.400
This video isn't about how automation is bad, rather that automation is inevitable.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.040
It's a tool to produce abundance for little effort.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.200
We need to start thinking now about what to do when large sections of the population are

14:42.200 --> 14:44.880
unemployable through no fault of their own.

14:44.880 --> 14:49.200
What to do in a future where, for most jobs, humans need not apply.
