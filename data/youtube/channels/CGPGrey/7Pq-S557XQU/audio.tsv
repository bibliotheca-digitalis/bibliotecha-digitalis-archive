0	8940	Every human used to have to hunt or gather to survive, but humans are smartly lazy, so
8940	11740	we made tools to make our work easier.
11740	15420	From sticks to plows to tractors, we've gone from everyone needing to make food to
15420	19100	modern agriculture with almost no one needing to make food.
19100	20300	And yet we still have abundance.
20300	23120	Of course, it's not just farming, it's everything.
23120	26960	We've spent the last several thousand years building tools to reduce physical labor of
26960	28300	all kinds.
28300	33120	These are mechanical muscles, stronger, more reliable, and more tireless than human muscles
33120	34120	ever could be.
34120	35120	And that's a good thing.
35120	39560	Replacing human labor with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize, and that leaves
39560	43300	everyone better off, even those still doing physical labor.
43300	46560	This is how economies grow and standards of living rise.
46560	51160	Some people have specialized to be programmers and engineers whose job is to build mechanical
51160	52160	minds.
52160	56380	Just as mechanical muscles made human labor less in demand, so are mechanical minds making
56380	59060	human brain labor less in demand.
59060	60720	This is an economic revolution.
60720	63760	You may think we've been here before, but we haven't.
63760	67080	This time is different.
67080	69840	When you think of automation, you probably think of this.
69840	74760	Giant, custom-built, expensive, efficient, but really dumb robots blind to the world
74760	75920	and their own work.
75920	79820	They were a scary kind of automation, but they haven't taken over the world because
79820	83280	they're only cost-effective in narrow situations.
83280	85600	But they're the old kind of automation.
85620	87180	This is the new kind.
87180	88300	Meet Baxter.
88300	92020	Unlike these things, which require skilled operators and technicians and millions of
92020	97020	dollars, Baxter has vision and can learn what you want him to do by watching you do it.
97020	100780	And he costs less than the average annual salary of a human worker.
100780	104760	Unlike his older brothers, he isn't pre-programmed for one specific job.
104760	108100	He can do whatever work is within the reach of his arms.
108100	112660	Baxter is what might be thought of as a general purpose robot, and general purpose is a big
112660	113660	deal.
113660	114660	Think computers.
114720	119440	22 started out as highly custom and highly expensive, but when cheap-ish general purpose
119440	122600	computers appeared, they quickly became vital to everything.
122600	127460	A general purpose computer can just as easily calculate change or assign seats on an airplane
127460	131520	or play a game or do anything just by swapping its software.
131520	136320	And this huge demand for computers of all kinds is what makes them both more powerful
136320	138200	and cheaper every year.
138200	141040	Baxter today is the computer of the 1980s.
141040	143320	He's not the apex, but the beginning.
143320	147940	If Baxter is slow, his hourly cost is pennies worth of electricity while his meat-based
147940	150100	competition costs minimum wage.
150100	154260	A tenth of the speed is still cost-effective when it's a hundredth the price.
154260	157380	And while Baxter isn't as smart as some of the other things we will talk about, he's
157380	160540	smart enough to take over many low-skilled jobs.
160540	164300	And we've already seen how dumber robots than Baxter can replace jobs.
164300	170500	In new supermarkets, what used to be 30 humans is now one human overseeing 30 cashier robots.
170500	174500	Or take the hundreds of thousands of baristas employed worldwide, there's a barista robot
174500	175500	coming for them.
175500	179480	Sure, maybe your guy makes the double mocha whatever just perfect and you'd never trust
179480	184480	anyone else, but millions of people don't care and just want a decent cup of coffee.
184480	188780	Oh, and by the way, this robot is actually a giant network of robots that remembers who
188780	192320	you are and how you like your coffee no matter where you are.
192320	193320	Pretty convenient.
193320	197640	We think of technological change as the fancy new expensive stuff, but the real change comes
197640	200920	from last decade stuff getting cheaper and faster.
200920	203120	That's what's happening to robots now.
203120	207220	And because their mechanical minds are capable of decision-making, they are out-competing
207220	213660	humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical muscle ever could.
213660	217620	Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s talking about technology.
217620	221160	One worries all these new mechanical muscles will make horses unnecessary.
221160	225260	The other reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier.
225260	226540	Remember all that farm work?
226540	228780	Remember running from coast to coast delivering mail?
228780	230380	Remember riding into battle?
230380	231440	All terrible.
231440	235180	These new city jobs are pretty cushy and with so many humans in the cities there will be
235180	237420	more jobs for horses than ever.
237420	241860	Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we
241860	242860	can't imagine.
242860	246600	But you, dear viewer from beyond 2000, know what happened.
246600	249900	There are still working horses, but nothing like before.
249900	252440	The horse population peaked in 1915.
252440	255180	From that point on, it was nothing but down.
255180	259100	There isn't a rule of economics that says better technology makes more better jobs for
259100	260100	horses.
260100	263100	It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud.
263100	267420	But swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.
267420	271480	As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of the economy, mechanical minds will do the
271480	272900	same to humans.
272900	277660	Not immediately, not everywhere, but in large enough numbers and soon enough that it's going
277660	280940	to be a huge problem if we're not prepared.
280940	282220	And we're not prepared.
282260	285980	You, like the second horse, may look at the state of technology now and think it can't
285980	287780	possibly replace your job.
287780	292280	But technology gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate biology can't match.
292280	296340	Just as the car was the beginning of the end for the horse, so now does the car show us
296340	298220	the shape of things to come.
301740	303580	Self-driving cars aren't the future.
303580	305580	They're here and they work.
305580	308600	Self-driving cars have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles up and down the California
308600	312200	coast and through cities all without human intervention.
312200	315740	The question is not if they'll replace cars, but how quickly.
315740	319320	They don't need to be perfect, they just need to be better than us.
319320	325040	Human drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a year with cars just in the United States.
325040	328640	Given that self-driving cars don't blink, don't text while driving, don't get sleepy
328640	333760	or stupid, it's easy to see them being better than humans because they already are.
333760	338960	Now to describe self-driving cars as cars at all is like calling the first cars mechanical
338960	339960	horses.
339960	344620	Cars in all their forms are so much more than horses that using the name limits your thinking
344620	346760	about what they can even do.
346760	349280	Let's call self-driving cars what they really are.
349280	353560	Autos, the solution to the transport objects from point A to point B problem.
353560	357740	Traditional cars happen to be human-sized to transport humans, but tiny autos can work
357740	360760	in warehouses and gigantic autos can work in pit mines.
360760	365200	Moving stuff around is who knows how many jobs, but the transportation industry in the
365200	368240	United States employs about 3 million people.
368240	373460	Trampolating worldwide, that's something like 70 million jobs at a minimum.
373460	375260	These jobs are over.
375260	379240	The usual argument is that the unions will prevent it, but history is filled with workers
379240	385080	who fought technology that would replace them and the workers always lose, economics always
385080	390380	wins, and there are huge incentives across wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.
390380	394760	For many transportation companies, humans are about a third their total costs.
394760	396680	That's just the straight salaries.
396680	401160	Autos sleeping in their long-haul trucks cost time and money, accidents cost money, carelessness
401160	402160	costs money.
402160	405060	If you think insurance companies will be against it, guess what?
405060	410080	Their perfect driver is one who pays their small premiums and never gets into an accident.
410080	414080	The autos are coming and they're the first place where most people will really see the
414080	418480	robots changing society, but there are many other places in the economy where the same
418480	420840	thing is happening, just less visibly.
420840	427160	So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.
427160	430720	It's easy to look at autos and backsters and think, technology has always gotten rid of
430720	433800	low-skilled jobs we don't want people doing anyway.
433800	437880	They'll get more skilled and do better-educated jobs like they've always done.
437880	442480	Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred million additional people through higher education,
442480	445160	white-collar work is no safe haven either.
445160	449060	If your job is sitting in front of a screen and typing and clicking, like maybe you're
449060	452860	supposed to be doing right now, the bots are coming for you too, buddy.
452860	457600	Software bots are both intangible and way faster and cheaper than physical robots.
457600	461340	Given that white-collar workers are, from a company's perspective, both more expensive
461340	466140	and more numerous, the incentive to automate their work is greater than low-skilled work.
466140	469540	And that's just what automation engineers are for.
469540	474220	These are skilled programmers whose entire job is to replace your job with a software
474220	475220	bot.
475220	478940	You may think even the world's smartest automation engineer could never make a bot to do your
478940	483660	job and you may be right, but the cutting edge of programming isn't super smart programmers
483660	488580	writing bots, it's super smart programmers writing bots that teach themselves how to
488580	491740	do things the programmer could never teach them to do.
491740	495520	How that works is well beyond the scope of this video, but the bottom line is there are
495520	500060	limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done
500060	503960	stuff and it can figure out how to do the job to be done.
503960	507880	Even with just a goal and no knowledge of how to do it, the bots can still learn.
507880	512380	Take the stock market, which in many ways is no longer a human endeavor.
512380	516720	It's mostly bots that taught themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks with other bots
516720	518280	that taught themselves.
518280	521880	As a result, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange isn't filled with traders doing
521880	524960	their day jobs anymore, it's largely a TV set.
524960	528000	So bots have learned the market and bots have learned to write.
528000	531320	If you've picked up a newspaper lately, you've probably already read a story written
531320	532380	by a bot.
532380	536780	There are companies that teach bots to write anything, sports stories, TPS reports, even
536780	539820	say those quarterly reports that you write at work.
539820	543900	Paperwork, decision making, writing, a lot of human work falls into that category and
543900	548540	the demand for human mental labor in these areas is on the way down.
548540	555640	But surely the professions are still safe from bots, yes?
555640	559880	When you think lawyer, it's easy to think of trials, but the bulk of lawyering is actually
559880	564380	drafting legal documents, predicting the likely outcome and impact of lawsuits and something
564380	568740	called discovery, which is where boxes of paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they
568740	572620	need to find the pattern or the one out of place transaction among it all.
572620	574420	This can be bot work.
574420	578700	Discovery in particular is already not a human job in many law firms.
578700	582100	Not because there isn't paperwork to go through, there's more of it than ever, but
582100	586020	because clever research bots shift through millions of emails and memos and accounts
586020	591620	in hours, not weeks, crushing human researchers in terms of not just cost and time, but most
591620	593740	importantly, accuracy.
593740	596860	Just don't get sleepy reading through a million emails.
596860	598180	But that's the simple stuff.
598180	600300	IBM has a bot named Watson.
600300	604400	You may have seen him on TV destroy humans at Jeopardy, but that was just a fun side
604400	605400	project for him.
605400	609800	Watson's day job is to be the best doctor in the world, to understand what people say
609800	613180	in their own words and give back accurate diagnoses.
613180	617700	He's already doing that at Sloan Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer treatments.
617700	621500	Just as autos don't need to be perfect, they just need to make fewer mistakes than
621500	623940	The same goes for doctor bots.
623940	625700	Human doctors are by no means perfect.
625700	630720	The frequency and severity of misdiagnoses are terrifying, and human doctors are severely
630720	634940	limited in dealing with a human's complicated medical history.
634940	639060	Understanding every drug and every drug's interaction with every other drug is beyond
639060	641020	the scope of human knowability.
641020	645180	Especially when there are research robots whose whole job it is to test thousands of
645180	646820	new drugs at a time.
646820	650400	And human doctors can only improve through their own experiences.
650400	653760	Doctor bots can learn from the experience of every doctor bot, can read the latest in
653760	657760	medical research and keep track of everything that happens to all their patients worldwide
657760	661760	and make correlations that would be impossible to find otherwise.
661760	666340	Not all doctors will go away, but when the doctor bots are comparable to humans and they're
666340	670920	only as far away as your phone, the need for general doctors will be less.
670920	675240	So professionals, white collar workers and low skill workers all have things to worry
675240	676920	about from automation.
676920	681440	Perhaps you are unphased because you're a special creative snowflake.
681440	682440	Well guess what?
682440	688160	You're not that special.
688160	690640	Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn't.
690640	694920	The brain is a complicated machine, perhaps the most complicated machine in the whole
694920	698160	universe, but that hasn't stopped us from trying to simulate it.
698160	702120	There is this notion that just as mechanical muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs,
702120	705600	that mechanical minds will allow us to move into creative work.
705600	709800	But even if we assume the human mind is magically creative, it's not, but just for the sake
709800	714620	of argument, artistic creativity isn't what the majority of jobs depend on.
714620	718260	The number of writers and poets and directors and actors and artists who actually make a
718260	722720	living doing their work is a tiny, tiny portion of the labor force.
722720	727380	And given that these are professions dependent on popularity, they'll always be a very small
727380	728760	portion of the population.
728760	732680	There can't be such a thing as a poem and painting based economy.
732760	736360	Oh, by the way, this music in the background that you're listening to?
736360	737640	It was written by a bot.
737640	741440	Her name is Emily Howell and she can write an infinite amount of new music all day for
741440	742440	free.
742440	746160	And people can't tell the difference between her and human composers when put to a blind
746160	747160	test.
747160	751960	Talking about artificial creativity gets weird fast, what does that even mean, but nonetheless
751960	753800	it's a developing field.
753800	757280	People used to think that playing chess was a uniquely creative human skill that machines
757280	760840	could never do, right up until the point they beat the best of us.
760920	763400	So it will go for all human talents.
767200	771200	Right, this may have been a lot to take in and you might want to reject it.
771200	774920	It's easy to be cynical of the endless and idiotic predictions of futures that never
774920	775920	are.
775920	779760	So that's why it's important to emphasize again that this stuff isn't science fiction.
779760	781840	The robots are here right now.
781840	787460	There is a terrifying amount of working automation in labs and warehouses around the world.
787460	792740	We have been through economic revolutions before, but the robot revolution is different.
792740	797980	Horses aren't unemployed now because they got lazy as a species, they're unemployable.
797980	801860	There's little work that a horse can do to pay for its housing and hay.
801860	806620	And many bright, perfectly capable humans will find themselves the new horse, unemployable
806620	808580	through no fault of their own.
808580	812780	But if you still think new jobs will save us, here is one final point to consider.
812780	817240	The US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds of jobs.
817240	821660	Now there are hundreds of kinds of jobs, but the new ones are not a significant part
821660	822880	of the labor force.
822880	826200	Here's the list of jobs ranked by the number of people who perform them.
826200	829880	It's a sobering list with the transportation industry at the top.
829880	835480	Continuing downward, all of this work existed in some form a hundred years ago and almost
835480	838460	all of them are easy targets for automation.
838460	842640	Only when we get to number 33 on the list is there finally something new.
842640	846560	Don't think that every barista or white collar worker need lose their job before things are
846560	847560	a problem.
847560	850820	The unemployment rate during the Great Depression was 25%.
850820	854920	The list above is 45% of the workforce.
854920	859440	Just what we've talked about today, the stuff that already works, can push us over that
859440	861080	number pretty soon.
861080	866440	And given that even in our modern technological wonderland, new kinds of work aren't a significant
866440	869980	portion of the economy, this is a big problem.
869980	874400	This video isn't about how automation is bad, rather that automation is inevitable.
874840	878040	It's a tool to produce abundance for little effort.
878040	882200	We need to start thinking now about what to do when large sections of the population are
882200	884880	unemployable through no fault of their own.
884880	889200	What to do in a future where, for most jobs, humans need not apply.
