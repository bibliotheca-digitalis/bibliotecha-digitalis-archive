1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940
Every human used to have to hunt or gather to survive, but humans are smartly lazy, so

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,740
we made tools to make our work easier.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,420
From sticks to plows to tractors, we've gone from everyone needing to make food to

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,100
modern agriculture with almost no one needing to make food.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,300
And yet we still have abundance.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,120
Of course, it's not just farming, it's everything.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,960
We've spent the last several thousand years building tools to reduce physical labor of

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,300
all kinds.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,120
These are mechanical muscles, stronger, more reliable, and more tireless than human muscles

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
ever could be.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
And that's a good thing.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,560
Replacing human labor with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize, and that leaves

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,300
everyone better off, even those still doing physical labor.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,560
This is how economies grow and standards of living rise.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,160
Some people have specialized to be programmers and engineers whose job is to build mechanical

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
minds.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,380
Just as mechanical muscles made human labor less in demand, so are mechanical minds making

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,060
human brain labor less in demand.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,720
This is an economic revolution.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,760
You may think we've been here before, but we haven't.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,080
This time is different.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,840
When you think of automation, you probably think of this.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,760
Giant, custom-built, expensive, efficient, but really dumb robots blind to the world

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,920
and their own work.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,820
They were a scary kind of automation, but they haven't taken over the world because

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,280
they're only cost-effective in narrow situations.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
But they're the old kind of automation.

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,180
This is the new kind.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,300
Meet Baxter.

30
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,020
Unlike these things, which require skilled operators and technicians and millions of

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,020
dollars, Baxter has vision and can learn what you want him to do by watching you do it.

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,780
And he costs less than the average annual salary of a human worker.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,760
Unlike his older brothers, he isn't pre-programmed for one specific job.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,100
He can do whatever work is within the reach of his arms.

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,660
Baxter is what might be thought of as a general purpose robot, and general purpose is a big

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
deal.

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
Think computers.

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,440
22 started out as highly custom and highly expensive, but when cheap-ish general purpose

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,600
computers appeared, they quickly became vital to everything.

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,460
A general purpose computer can just as easily calculate change or assign seats on an airplane

41
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,520
or play a game or do anything just by swapping its software.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,320
And this huge demand for computers of all kinds is what makes them both more powerful

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,200
and cheaper every year.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,040
Baxter today is the computer of the 1980s.

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,320
He's not the apex, but the beginning.

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,940
If Baxter is slow, his hourly cost is pennies worth of electricity while his meat-based

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,100
competition costs minimum wage.

48
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,260
A tenth of the speed is still cost-effective when it's a hundredth the price.

49
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,380
And while Baxter isn't as smart as some of the other things we will talk about, he's

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,540
smart enough to take over many low-skilled jobs.

51
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,300
And we've already seen how dumber robots than Baxter can replace jobs.

52
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,500
In new supermarkets, what used to be 30 humans is now one human overseeing 30 cashier robots.

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Or take the hundreds of thousands of baristas employed worldwide, there's a barista robot

54
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
coming for them.

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,480
Sure, maybe your guy makes the double mocha whatever just perfect and you'd never trust

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,480
anyone else, but millions of people don't care and just want a decent cup of coffee.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,780
Oh, and by the way, this robot is actually a giant network of robots that remembers who

58
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,320
you are and how you like your coffee no matter where you are.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Pretty convenient.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,640
We think of technological change as the fancy new expensive stuff, but the real change comes

61
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,920
from last decade stuff getting cheaper and faster.

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,120
That's what's happening to robots now.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,220
And because their mechanical minds are capable of decision-making, they are out-competing

64
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,660
humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical muscle ever could.

65
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,620
Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s talking about technology.

66
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,160
One worries all these new mechanical muscles will make horses unnecessary.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,260
The other reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier.

68
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,540
Remember all that farm work?

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,780
Remember running from coast to coast delivering mail?

70
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,380
Remember riding into battle?

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,440
All terrible.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,180
These new city jobs are pretty cushy and with so many humans in the cities there will be

73
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,420
more jobs for horses than ever.

74
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,860
Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we

75
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,860
can't imagine.

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,600
But you, dear viewer from beyond 2000, know what happened.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,900
There are still working horses, but nothing like before.

78
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,440
The horse population peaked in 1915.

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,180
From that point on, it was nothing but down.

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,100
There isn't a rule of economics that says better technology makes more better jobs for

81
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
horses.

82
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,100
It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,420
But swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.

84
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,480
As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of the economy, mechanical minds will do the

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,900
same to humans.

86
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,660
Not immediately, not everywhere, but in large enough numbers and soon enough that it's going

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,940
to be a huge problem if we're not prepared.

88
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,220
And we're not prepared.

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,980
You, like the second horse, may look at the state of technology now and think it can't

90
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,780
possibly replace your job.

91
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,280
But technology gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate biology can't match.

92
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,340
Just as the car was the beginning of the end for the horse, so now does the car show us

93
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,220
the shape of things to come.

94
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,580
Self-driving cars aren't the future.

95
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
They're here and they work.

96
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,600
Self-driving cars have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles up and down the California

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,200
coast and through cities all without human intervention.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,740
The question is not if they'll replace cars, but how quickly.

99
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,320
They don't need to be perfect, they just need to be better than us.

100
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,040
Human drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a year with cars just in the United States.

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,640
Given that self-driving cars don't blink, don't text while driving, don't get sleepy

102
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,760
or stupid, it's easy to see them being better than humans because they already are.

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,960
Now to describe self-driving cars as cars at all is like calling the first cars mechanical

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
horses.

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,620
Cars in all their forms are so much more than horses that using the name limits your thinking

106
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,760
about what they can even do.

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,280
Let's call self-driving cars what they really are.

108
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,560
Autos, the solution to the transport objects from point A to point B problem.

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,740
Traditional cars happen to be human-sized to transport humans, but tiny autos can work

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,760
in warehouses and gigantic autos can work in pit mines.

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,200
Moving stuff around is who knows how many jobs, but the transportation industry in the

112
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,240
United States employs about 3 million people.

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,460
Trampolating worldwide, that's something like 70 million jobs at a minimum.

114
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,260
These jobs are over.

115
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,240
The usual argument is that the unions will prevent it, but history is filled with workers

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,080
who fought technology that would replace them and the workers always lose, economics always

117
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,380
wins, and there are huge incentives across wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.

118
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,760
For many transportation companies, humans are about a third their total costs.

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,680
That's just the straight salaries.

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,160
Autos sleeping in their long-haul trucks cost time and money, accidents cost money, carelessness

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
costs money.

122
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,060
If you think insurance companies will be against it, guess what?

123
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,080
Their perfect driver is one who pays their small premiums and never gets into an accident.

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
The autos are coming and they're the first place where most people will really see the

125
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,480
robots changing society, but there are many other places in the economy where the same

126
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,840
thing is happening, just less visibly.

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,160
So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.

128
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,720
It's easy to look at autos and backsters and think, technology has always gotten rid of

129
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,800
low-skilled jobs we don't want people doing anyway.

130
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,880
They'll get more skilled and do better-educated jobs like they've always done.

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred million additional people through higher education,

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,160
white-collar work is no safe haven either.

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,060
If your job is sitting in front of a screen and typing and clicking, like maybe you're

134
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,860
supposed to be doing right now, the bots are coming for you too, buddy.

135
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,600
Software bots are both intangible and way faster and cheaper than physical robots.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,340
Given that white-collar workers are, from a company's perspective, both more expensive

137
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,140
and more numerous, the incentive to automate their work is greater than low-skilled work.

138
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,540
And that's just what automation engineers are for.

139
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,220
These are skilled programmers whose entire job is to replace your job with a software

140
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,220
bot.

141
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,940
You may think even the world's smartest automation engineer could never make a bot to do your

142
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,660
job and you may be right, but the cutting edge of programming isn't super smart programmers

143
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,580
writing bots, it's super smart programmers writing bots that teach themselves how to

144
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,740
do things the programmer could never teach them to do.

145
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,520
How that works is well beyond the scope of this video, but the bottom line is there are

146
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,060
limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done

147
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,960
stuff and it can figure out how to do the job to be done.

148
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,880
Even with just a goal and no knowledge of how to do it, the bots can still learn.

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,380
Take the stock market, which in many ways is no longer a human endeavor.

150
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,720
It's mostly bots that taught themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks with other bots

151
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,280
that taught themselves.

152
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,880
As a result, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange isn't filled with traders doing

153
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,960
their day jobs anymore, it's largely a TV set.

154
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,000
So bots have learned the market and bots have learned to write.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,320
If you've picked up a newspaper lately, you've probably already read a story written

156
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,380
by a bot.

157
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,780
There are companies that teach bots to write anything, sports stories, TPS reports, even

158
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,820
say those quarterly reports that you write at work.

159
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,900
Paperwork, decision making, writing, a lot of human work falls into that category and

160
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,540
the demand for human mental labor in these areas is on the way down.

161
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:15,640
But surely the professions are still safe from bots, yes?

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,880
When you think lawyer, it's easy to think of trials, but the bulk of lawyering is actually

163
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,380
drafting legal documents, predicting the likely outcome and impact of lawsuits and something

164
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,740
called discovery, which is where boxes of paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they

165
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,620
need to find the pattern or the one out of place transaction among it all.

166
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,420
This can be bot work.

167
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,700
Discovery in particular is already not a human job in many law firms.

168
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,100
Not because there isn't paperwork to go through, there's more of it than ever, but

169
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,020
because clever research bots shift through millions of emails and memos and accounts

170
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,620
in hours, not weeks, crushing human researchers in terms of not just cost and time, but most

171
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,740
importantly, accuracy.

172
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,860
Just don't get sleepy reading through a million emails.

173
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,180
But that's the simple stuff.

174
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,300
IBM has a bot named Watson.

175
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,400
You may have seen him on TV destroy humans at Jeopardy, but that was just a fun side

176
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
project for him.

177
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Watson's day job is to be the best doctor in the world, to understand what people say

178
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,180
in their own words and give back accurate diagnoses.

179
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,700
He's already doing that at Sloan Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer treatments.

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,500
Just as autos don't need to be perfect, they just need to make fewer mistakes than

181
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,940
The same goes for doctor bots.

182
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,700
Human doctors are by no means perfect.

183
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,720
The frequency and severity of misdiagnoses are terrifying, and human doctors are severely

184
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,940
limited in dealing with a human's complicated medical history.

185
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,060
Understanding every drug and every drug's interaction with every other drug is beyond

186
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,020
the scope of human knowability.

187
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,180
Especially when there are research robots whose whole job it is to test thousands of

188
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,820
new drugs at a time.

189
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,400
And human doctors can only improve through their own experiences.

190
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,760
Doctor bots can learn from the experience of every doctor bot, can read the latest in

191
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
medical research and keep track of everything that happens to all their patients worldwide

192
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
and make correlations that would be impossible to find otherwise.

193
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,340
Not all doctors will go away, but when the doctor bots are comparable to humans and they're

194
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,920
only as far away as your phone, the need for general doctors will be less.

195
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,240
So professionals, white collar workers and low skill workers all have things to worry

196
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
about from automation.

197
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,440
Perhaps you are unphased because you're a special creative snowflake.

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Well guess what?

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,160
You're not that special.

200
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn't.

201
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,920
The brain is a complicated machine, perhaps the most complicated machine in the whole

202
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,160
universe, but that hasn't stopped us from trying to simulate it.

203
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,120
There is this notion that just as mechanical muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs,

204
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,600
that mechanical minds will allow us to move into creative work.

205
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,800
But even if we assume the human mind is magically creative, it's not, but just for the sake

206
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,620
of argument, artistic creativity isn't what the majority of jobs depend on.

207
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,260
The number of writers and poets and directors and actors and artists who actually make a

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,720
living doing their work is a tiny, tiny portion of the labor force.

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,380
And given that these are professions dependent on popularity, they'll always be a very small

210
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,760
portion of the population.

211
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,680
There can't be such a thing as a poem and painting based economy.

212
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,360
Oh, by the way, this music in the background that you're listening to?

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
It was written by a bot.

214
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,440
Her name is Emily Howell and she can write an infinite amount of new music all day for

215
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
free.

216
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,160
And people can't tell the difference between her and human composers when put to a blind

217
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
test.

218
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,960
Talking about artificial creativity gets weird fast, what does that even mean, but nonetheless

219
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,800
it's a developing field.

220
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,280
People used to think that playing chess was a uniquely creative human skill that machines

221
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,840
could never do, right up until the point they beat the best of us.

222
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,400
So it will go for all human talents.

223
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Right, this may have been a lot to take in and you might want to reject it.

224
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,920
It's easy to be cynical of the endless and idiotic predictions of futures that never

225
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
are.

226
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
So that's why it's important to emphasize again that this stuff isn't science fiction.

227
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,840
The robots are here right now.

228
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,460
There is a terrifying amount of working automation in labs and warehouses around the world.

229
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,740
We have been through economic revolutions before, but the robot revolution is different.

230
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,980
Horses aren't unemployed now because they got lazy as a species, they're unemployable.

231
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,860
There's little work that a horse can do to pay for its housing and hay.

232
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,620
And many bright, perfectly capable humans will find themselves the new horse, unemployable

233
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,580
through no fault of their own.

234
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,780
But if you still think new jobs will save us, here is one final point to consider.

235
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,240
The US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds of jobs.

236
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,660
Now there are hundreds of kinds of jobs, but the new ones are not a significant part

237
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,880
of the labor force.

238
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,200
Here's the list of jobs ranked by the number of people who perform them.

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,880
It's a sobering list with the transportation industry at the top.

240
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,480
Continuing downward, all of this work existed in some form a hundred years ago and almost

241
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,460
all of them are easy targets for automation.

242
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,640
Only when we get to number 33 on the list is there finally something new.

243
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,560
Don't think that every barista or white collar worker need lose their job before things are

244
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
a problem.

245
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,820
The unemployment rate during the Great Depression was 25%.

246
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,920
The list above is 45% of the workforce.

247
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,440
Just what we've talked about today, the stuff that already works, can push us over that

248
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,080
number pretty soon.

249
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,440
And given that even in our modern technological wonderland, new kinds of work aren't a significant

250
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,980
portion of the economy, this is a big problem.

251
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,400
This video isn't about how automation is bad, rather that automation is inevitable.

252
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,040
It's a tool to produce abundance for little effort.

253
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,200
We need to start thinking now about what to do when large sections of the population are

254
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,880
unemployable through no fault of their own.

255
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,200
What to do in a future where, for most jobs, humans need not apply.
