1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Many teachers have a poor work-life balance.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,480
I know because I've had years of experience as a teacher in the classroom.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,520
I'm here to teach you how to handle your workload and restore that work-life

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,240
balance.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,000
If you follow my time management methods, long days should be a thing of the past.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,320
You'll be able to go home on time, worry-free, knowing that you've done

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,400
everything you need to do.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,700
Let's begin. One of the biggest challenges you face as a teacher

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,600
is your uncooperative co-workers, your students. Sometimes they try and do as

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,840
little work as possible

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,480
and it can be tempting to let them get away with it. After all, if some of them

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,360
don't do their homework,

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,640
that's less homework for you to mark. Small problems like this, such as letting

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
an individual student get away with not doing homework or a project,

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
can quickly grow into big problems, like the entire class not doing their

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,520
homework.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,600
Ultimately, if the students aren't doing the work you're assigning them, they're going to

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,840
do less well on the tests

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,860
and they're learning less. You also have to spend more and more time in your day

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,680
dealing with classroom management issues,

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,760
like trying to get them to do their work. The students don't learn just what you

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,440
teach them directly, they're also learning about you as a person.

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,280
If you're the kind of teacher who lets homework slide, they're going to be less

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,760
and less likely to do work for you and to respect you.

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,560
You have to make sure that you're keeping track of everything that's going

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
on in your classroom.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
But this is quite a challenge, because oftentimes teachers have 500 or more

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,440
students that they need to be looking after.

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,520
How do you make sure that you're keeping track of what everybody owes you and what

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,360
needs to be done?

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,000
The tool that I recommend that can change your life is just a small, sturdy

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,480
clipboard. If you go out and you get one for yourself today, I guarantee you it'll

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,760
change your life as a teacher.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,760
There are three kinds of things that you should keep on your clipboard.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,560
There are tracking sheets, there are daily must-do lists, and there's a general to-do list.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,040
I want to talk about the tracking sheet first.

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,280
The tracking sheet starts out its life as just a plain piece of blank paper.

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,720
But as the days go by, if any student misses something for you,

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,960
a homework or a project, you put their name on this list,

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,360
make a note of what the thing is that they're missing, and the date that this

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,000
happened on.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You should go through this list at least once a week and cross off anybody who's

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,240
gotten work back to you,

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
or send messages to those who haven't. If a student continues not to give

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,720
something to you,

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,640
you need to look into your own school sanctions policies. As long as you never

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,480
cross off anybody's name before they've given you what they owe you,

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,960
you'll always be making sure that you get every piece of work from every student.

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,680
When collecting in the homework from students, you should go around to the

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,320
student's desk

51
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,600
individually, collect each piece of homework, and then write down the names

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,840
of those who don't have it.

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,320
If you do this regularly, the students will quickly learn that you're the kind of

54
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,000
teacher who doesn't let things slide,

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,120
and they'll put you on the top of their own to-do lists. The second thing to talk

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,480
about

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
are the daily must-do lists. On your computer,

58
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,760
you should make a Word document that has a blank page for each work day.

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,360
On those pages, you're going to put down the things that must happen by the end of

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
that day

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,200
in order to be fully prepared for the next day. So as an example,

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,600
every Monday you need to list all of the classes that you need to plan for on

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Tuesday.

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,440
If there's anything else that needs to be done before Tuesday, also put that on

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,000
that list.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,280
The thing that really makes this work is that it is a must-do list.

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,440
This is not a daily to-do list. You're not putting down things that you would

68
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,040
like to get done by the end of the day, but that are ultimately optional.

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,320
You need to put down things that have to get done. I like to think of this as my

70
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,680
I must do this before I can go home list. If you limit your list to only the

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
things that absolutely have to get done,

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,600
it's much more motivating to knock those things off so you know you can go home

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,640
at the end of the day and not have to be worrying all night about what you need

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,920
to do first thing in the morning to be ready for the day.

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,840
The last thing to keep on the clipboard is a general to-do list.

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,420
This is a list for everything that doesn't fit on your must-do lists.

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,820
Anything that is less time-sensitive goes on here.

78
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,060
Any general project that you need to do at some point, but not by a specific day,

79
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,940
will all be kept track of on here. After you've crossed off your must-do list,

80
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,780
then you would turn over to your general to-do list and start working through

81
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,300
those items if you have time.

82
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,580
The next thing I want to talk about is paperwork. Teachers deal with a lot of

83
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,220
paper and you have to have a system for keeping it all together.

84
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,780
This is what I recommend. You should have one folder for each class that you teach.

85
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,740
Within that folder, you're going to keep all of the papers that you currently need

86
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,980
to teach that class. So, any worksheets that you're going to give out,

87
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,180
any tests you're going to give out, homework that you've gotten back and need

88
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,720
to mark, all of those kinds of things go into this folder.

89
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,180
Any reference materials that you wouldn't need on a particular day to teach that

90
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,060
class, such as workbooks that you use to photocopy the worksheets from,

91
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,300
those you can keep in a separate filing cabinet. Here's an example of the kind

92
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,780
of thing to keep inside one of the folders.

93
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,700
This is a collection of papers that's for a year 10 test. There's three parts to

94
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,060
this little packet, so let's take a look at them. First, there's the papers

95
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,780
themselves. Secondly, there's a title sheet that clearly describes what they

96
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,260
are, in this example, year 10 tests. And lastly, there's a cover slip which keeps

97
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,580
all of these things together. If you leave a lot of blank space in your cover

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,140
sheet, you can add additional information later on, such as when you've given the

99
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,860
test to the students and received them back, you can add to mark on the front of

100
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,940
that sheet so that you know you need to take care of this. And once you've marked

101
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,980
them, you can then cross that out. Again, to quickly review, keep one folder for

102
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,900
each of your classes, and keep all of the things that you need to teach that class

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,140
in that folder. Once you set up the system, you know that you just need that

104
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,620
single folder to be adequately prepared for the class. This is also convenient in

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,580
case there's a room change. You can just grab that folder and go. If you're able to

106
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,660
organize your files in the way that I've just recommended, and you're able to

107
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,740
consistently work with your daily must-do list, the advantage is that when you walk

108
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,780
into school on any day, you know that you're completely ready for whatever's

109
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,500
going to happen. You don't have to spend any of your day frantically planning for

110
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,820
that afternoon lesson, and if anything comes up unexpectedly, you don't have to

111
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,100
worry about it, because you're all set for every one of your lessons for that

112
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,980
day. Once you start getting used to this ready position, you'll find that you have

113
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,780
more time in the day than you actually originally thought. One of the places that

114
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,980
time has been hiding from you is in these little five-minute intervals between

115
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,220
lessons. After the last class leaves and before the next class comes in, you can

116
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,220
use this time in a productive way if you're prepared adequately. I recommend

117
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,180
that you keep a list of things that you can do in these little five-minute times.

118
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,180
For example, you can do some quick filing, or if you have an easy-to-mark quiz, you

119
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,420
can mark a couple of pages in that quiz. After a full day of teaching, you can

120
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,340
sometimes find that you've marked a complete class set of quizzes without

121
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,900
ever feeling like you had to sit down and mark the whole thing at once. I want

122
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,420
you to realize as a teacher that your job is a lot less clear than other jobs.

123
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,900
If you think of a factory worker, they have a clearly defined shift, which is

124
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,700
nine to five, and they're producing a tangible product such as a car. You know

125
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,060
when the car is done because all of the pieces have been fit together. Being a

126
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,140
teacher is not like this. If you're working on something like making

127
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,140
presentations or making a test for a class or a worksheet, this kind of work

128
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,220
can really go on forever. You can always make a presentation a little bit snappier

129
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,580
or you can always make a worksheet a little bit clearer. When you're making

130
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,460
something like a worksheet, at some point the worksheet is going to be serviceable.

131
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,940
It's going to be completely adequate for the educational aim that you're trying

132
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,780
to achieve. If you're going to continue working, you really need to stop and

133
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,860
think for a moment. Would I better spend my time making this worksheet absolutely

134
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,060
perfect or would my time be better spent moving on to something else? Most of the

135
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,620
time the answer is the latter. You're better off having two satisfactory

136
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,220
worksheets for two different classes than one perfect worksheet for one class

137
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,940
but no worksheet for the other one. Now let's talk about sick days. Teachers have

138
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,580
one of the lowest absentee rates of any profession and I don't think that's

139
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
because teachers are more healthy than most people. It's because as a teacher

140
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,820
sometimes missing a day of work is more of a hassle than just going in no matter

141
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,740
how poorly you may be feeling. Because of this, teachers don't often take days off

142
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,140
work until they're feeling really poor. Do yourself a favor as a teacher. Spend

143
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,780
some time creating lessons to be used in your absence ahead of time. If you make

144
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,860
them before you need them, when you actually are sick, you can just call in

145
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,340
the school and tell them. There's a file in my filing cabinet, it's called cover

146
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,700
work. Everything you need is in there and you can hang up the phone, crawl back

147
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,860
into bed, and spend your day getting better as opposed to spending your day

148
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,340
worrying about what your students are actually going to do. The last thing I

149
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,140
want to talk about is how big projects get done. Something like a cathedral

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,180
doesn't just pop into existence. It gets built very slowly over time one brick by

151
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,540
one brick. It's a good idea to try and carve out at least 20 minutes maybe 30

152
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,460
minutes every day to work on a long-term project that's beneficial to you and

153
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,820
your career. For example, if there's a new computer skill that you need to

154
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,300
learn, if you just spend 20 minutes a day on it, you can make real progress on

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,860
something like that over time. If you set aside daily time to work on your

156
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,980
long-term projects, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much you can accomplish.

157
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,580
When you look back in six months or a year, you'll be amazed at what you've
