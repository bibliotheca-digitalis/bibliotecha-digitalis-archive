0	3560	Many teachers have a poor work-life balance.
3560	6480	I know because I've had years of experience as a teacher in the classroom.
6480	9520	I'm here to teach you how to handle your workload and restore that work-life
9520	10240	balance.
10240	14000	If you follow my time management methods, long days should be a thing of the past.
14000	17320	You'll be able to go home on time, worry-free, knowing that you've done
17320	18400	everything you need to do.
18400	22700	Let's begin. One of the biggest challenges you face as a teacher
22700	26600	is your uncooperative co-workers, your students. Sometimes they try and do as
26600	27840	little work as possible
27840	31480	and it can be tempting to let them get away with it. After all, if some of them
31480	32360	don't do their homework,
32360	35640	that's less homework for you to mark. Small problems like this, such as letting
35640	38640	an individual student get away with not doing homework or a project,
38640	42000	can quickly grow into big problems, like the entire class not doing their
42000	42520	homework.
42520	45600	Ultimately, if the students aren't doing the work you're assigning them, they're going to
45600	46840	do less well on the tests
46840	49860	and they're learning less. You also have to spend more and more time in your day
49860	51680	dealing with classroom management issues,
51680	54760	like trying to get them to do their work. The students don't learn just what you
54760	57440	teach them directly, they're also learning about you as a person.
57440	60280	If you're the kind of teacher who lets homework slide, they're going to be less
60280	62760	and less likely to do work for you and to respect you.
62760	65560	You have to make sure that you're keeping track of everything that's going
65560	66560	on in your classroom.
66560	69680	But this is quite a challenge, because oftentimes teachers have 500 or more
69680	71440	students that they need to be looking after.
71440	74520	How do you make sure that you're keeping track of what everybody owes you and what
74520	75360	needs to be done?
75360	79000	The tool that I recommend that can change your life is just a small, sturdy
79000	82480	clipboard. If you go out and you get one for yourself today, I guarantee you it'll
82480	83760	change your life as a teacher.
83760	86760	There are three kinds of things that you should keep on your clipboard.
87120	91560	There are tracking sheets, there are daily must-do lists, and there's a general to-do list.
91560	94040	I want to talk about the tracking sheet first.
94040	97280	The tracking sheet starts out its life as just a plain piece of blank paper.
97280	100720	But as the days go by, if any student misses something for you,
100720	103960	a homework or a project, you put their name on this list,
103960	106360	make a note of what the thing is that they're missing, and the date that this
106360	108000	happened on.
108000	111000	You should go through this list at least once a week and cross off anybody who's
111000	112240	gotten work back to you,
112240	116000	or send messages to those who haven't. If a student continues not to give
116000	116720	something to you,
116720	120640	you need to look into your own school sanctions policies. As long as you never
120640	123480	cross off anybody's name before they've given you what they owe you,
123480	126960	you'll always be making sure that you get every piece of work from every student.
126960	129680	When collecting in the homework from students, you should go around to the
129680	130320	student's desk
130320	133600	individually, collect each piece of homework, and then write down the names
133600	134840	of those who don't have it.
134840	138320	If you do this regularly, the students will quickly learn that you're the kind of
138320	140000	teacher who doesn't let things slide,
140000	144120	and they'll put you on the top of their own to-do lists. The second thing to talk
144120	144480	about
144480	147600	are the daily must-do lists. On your computer,
147600	150760	you should make a Word document that has a blank page for each work day.
150760	154360	On those pages, you're going to put down the things that must happen by the end of
154360	155000	that day
155000	159200	in order to be fully prepared for the next day. So as an example,
159200	162600	every Monday you need to list all of the classes that you need to plan for on
162600	163320	Tuesday.
163320	166440	If there's anything else that needs to be done before Tuesday, also put that on
166440	167000	that list.
167000	170280	The thing that really makes this work is that it is a must-do list.
170280	173440	This is not a daily to-do list. You're not putting down things that you would
173480	177040	like to get done by the end of the day, but that are ultimately optional.
177040	181320	You need to put down things that have to get done. I like to think of this as my
181320	185680	I must do this before I can go home list. If you limit your list to only the
185680	187520	things that absolutely have to get done,
187520	190600	it's much more motivating to knock those things off so you know you can go home
190600	193640	at the end of the day and not have to be worrying all night about what you need
193640	195920	to do first thing in the morning to be ready for the day.
195920	199840	The last thing to keep on the clipboard is a general to-do list.
199840	203420	This is a list for everything that doesn't fit on your must-do lists.
204300	206820	Anything that is less time-sensitive goes on here.
206820	211060	Any general project that you need to do at some point, but not by a specific day,
211060	214940	will all be kept track of on here. After you've crossed off your must-do list,
214940	217780	then you would turn over to your general to-do list and start working through
217780	219300	those items if you have time.
219300	223580	The next thing I want to talk about is paperwork. Teachers deal with a lot of
223580	226220	paper and you have to have a system for keeping it all together.
226220	230780	This is what I recommend. You should have one folder for each class that you teach.
231300	234740	Within that folder, you're going to keep all of the papers that you currently need
234740	238980	to teach that class. So, any worksheets that you're going to give out,
238980	242180	any tests you're going to give out, homework that you've gotten back and need
242180	245720	to mark, all of those kinds of things go into this folder.
245720	249180	Any reference materials that you wouldn't need on a particular day to teach that
249180	253060	class, such as workbooks that you use to photocopy the worksheets from,
253060	257300	those you can keep in a separate filing cabinet. Here's an example of the kind
257300	259780	of thing to keep inside one of the folders.
259780	263700	This is a collection of papers that's for a year 10 test. There's three parts to
263700	267060	this little packet, so let's take a look at them. First, there's the papers
267060	270780	themselves. Secondly, there's a title sheet that clearly describes what they
270780	275260	are, in this example, year 10 tests. And lastly, there's a cover slip which keeps
275260	278580	all of these things together. If you leave a lot of blank space in your cover
278580	282140	sheet, you can add additional information later on, such as when you've given the
282140	285860	test to the students and received them back, you can add to mark on the front of
285860	288940	that sheet so that you know you need to take care of this. And once you've marked
288980	292980	them, you can then cross that out. Again, to quickly review, keep one folder for
292980	296900	each of your classes, and keep all of the things that you need to teach that class
296900	300140	in that folder. Once you set up the system, you know that you just need that
300140	303620	single folder to be adequately prepared for the class. This is also convenient in
303620	307580	case there's a room change. You can just grab that folder and go. If you're able to
307580	310660	organize your files in the way that I've just recommended, and you're able to
310660	314740	consistently work with your daily must-do list, the advantage is that when you walk
314740	317780	into school on any day, you know that you're completely ready for whatever's
317820	321500	going to happen. You don't have to spend any of your day frantically planning for
321500	324820	that afternoon lesson, and if anything comes up unexpectedly, you don't have to
324820	328100	worry about it, because you're all set for every one of your lessons for that
328100	331980	day. Once you start getting used to this ready position, you'll find that you have
331980	335780	more time in the day than you actually originally thought. One of the places that
335780	338980	time has been hiding from you is in these little five-minute intervals between
338980	343220	lessons. After the last class leaves and before the next class comes in, you can
343220	347220	use this time in a productive way if you're prepared adequately. I recommend
347220	350180	that you keep a list of things that you can do in these little five-minute times.
350180	355180	For example, you can do some quick filing, or if you have an easy-to-mark quiz, you
355180	359420	can mark a couple of pages in that quiz. After a full day of teaching, you can
359420	362340	sometimes find that you've marked a complete class set of quizzes without
362340	366900	ever feeling like you had to sit down and mark the whole thing at once. I want
366900	370420	you to realize as a teacher that your job is a lot less clear than other jobs.
370420	374900	If you think of a factory worker, they have a clearly defined shift, which is
374900	378700	nine to five, and they're producing a tangible product such as a car. You know
378700	382060	when the car is done because all of the pieces have been fit together. Being a
382060	385140	teacher is not like this. If you're working on something like making
385140	389140	presentations or making a test for a class or a worksheet, this kind of work
389140	393220	can really go on forever. You can always make a presentation a little bit snappier
393220	396580	or you can always make a worksheet a little bit clearer. When you're making
396580	400460	something like a worksheet, at some point the worksheet is going to be serviceable.
400460	403940	It's going to be completely adequate for the educational aim that you're trying
403980	407780	to achieve. If you're going to continue working, you really need to stop and
407780	412860	think for a moment. Would I better spend my time making this worksheet absolutely
412860	418060	perfect or would my time be better spent moving on to something else? Most of the
418060	421620	time the answer is the latter. You're better off having two satisfactory
421620	425220	worksheets for two different classes than one perfect worksheet for one class
425220	429940	but no worksheet for the other one. Now let's talk about sick days. Teachers have
429940	433580	one of the lowest absentee rates of any profession and I don't think that's
433620	436620	because teachers are more healthy than most people. It's because as a teacher
436620	440820	sometimes missing a day of work is more of a hassle than just going in no matter
440820	444740	how poorly you may be feeling. Because of this, teachers don't often take days off
444740	449140	work until they're feeling really poor. Do yourself a favor as a teacher. Spend
449140	453780	some time creating lessons to be used in your absence ahead of time. If you make
453780	456860	them before you need them, when you actually are sick, you can just call in
456860	460340	the school and tell them. There's a file in my filing cabinet, it's called cover
460340	463700	work. Everything you need is in there and you can hang up the phone, crawl back
463700	466860	into bed, and spend your day getting better as opposed to spending your day
466860	470340	worrying about what your students are actually going to do. The last thing I
470340	474140	want to talk about is how big projects get done. Something like a cathedral
474140	479180	doesn't just pop into existence. It gets built very slowly over time one brick by
479180	483540	one brick. It's a good idea to try and carve out at least 20 minutes maybe 30
483540	487460	minutes every day to work on a long-term project that's beneficial to you and
487460	490820	your career. For example, if there's a new computer skill that you need to
490820	494300	learn, if you just spend 20 minutes a day on it, you can make real progress on
494300	497860	something like that over time. If you set aside daily time to work on your
497860	500980	long-term projects, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much you can accomplish.
500980	504580	When you look back in six months or a year, you'll be amazed at what you've
504580	508580	done. And lastly, don't forget why it is you became a teacher in the first place,
508580	512020	the summer holidays.
