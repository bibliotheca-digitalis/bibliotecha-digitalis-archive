00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Your brain is two brains, two hemispheres, each doing half the work of being you.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,200
Half your vision goes to each and half your movement directed by each.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Right controls left and left controls right.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,480
Your two brains coordinate through a wire of nerves, but this wire can be cut

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
and was, for a time, used as an epilepsy treatment.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
After the cut, people seemed the same, though their brain was split in twain.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,360
Except some post-split patients described that while selecting their morning outfit

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,800
with right hand, left might come along to disagree.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
Actually, left hand might quite often disagree,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,240
which these split-brain patients found frustrating.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,200
What's happening?

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,880
To investigate, remember, right brain sees and controls one half

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,520
while left brain controls and sees the other.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
But only left brain can speak.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,120
Because that's where the speech center is located.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
Right brain without this is mute.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,560
In normal brains, this doesn't matter because each half communicates across the wire with the other.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,040
But split-brains can't, and thus you can show just the right brain a word.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,920
Ask the person, what did you see, and you'll hear...

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,480
Nothing.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,960
Because left-speaking brain saw nothing.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,400
Meanwhile, right brain will use its hand to pick the object out of a pile hidden from left brain.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
This is deeply creepy.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Ask, why are you holding the object,

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,040
and speaking left brain will make up a plausible sounding but totally wrong reason.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,120
I always wanted to learn how to solve one of these.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,400
Left brain isn't lying, it's just doing what brains do.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
Creating a story that explains its past actions to its current self.

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,400
A behavior which does rather cast doubt onto the notion of free will,

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,160
but that's a story for another time.

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Creating reasons for why it does things is just something left brains do.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
It happens in normal healthy humans all the time,

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
and if you think about it closely, you know you've done this.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,160
Back to experiments.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,920
Give right brain an object, ask the person what's in your hand, and they won't be able to say.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm not holding anything.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,640
And when asked to draw, a split brain can draw two separate objects simultaneously

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,400
with each hand in a way unsplit brains find challenging.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,800
These experiments on split brain patients are deeply unsettling because they really

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,520
point in the direction of a mute separate intelligence something living in the skull.

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,160
You can even ask questions of a split brain and get disagreement on the answer.

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,880
So if your brain is split, who is the you in this situation?

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,920
From the outside, it's tempting to think of the part of the brain that's speaking as the person,

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
but something is hearing and answering questions.

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,560
And the right brain can't speak, it does understand faces, which left brain can't.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,520
If this is you, you don't know who your friends and family are in a crowd.

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,760
This act of cutting exposes two minds in one head,

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
and the talking mind doesn't know there's someone else in the house.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
The left brain can describe the situation it's in,

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
but nonetheless will constantly be surprised by right brain's actions and explain them away.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,320
There's a question to be asked here.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Why, after separation, does right brain not totally freak out,

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,440
but instead plays along helpfully answering questions

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,640
and listening to left brain's dumb stories about what's happening?

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
It's the best pony? I don't know.

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,560
Speculation time, but one answer is the cutting doesn't make right brain a separate

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,080
intelligence, consciousness, person, but rather it has always been.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,720
In normal people, perhaps right brain grows up as a companion without a choice,

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
feeling at first somewhat equal partners,

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
but then as speech develops that it can't participate in,

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
that increasingly becomes the central point of life,

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
it resigns to mutely coordinate with left brain.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,200
One having a mind equals blown moment and the other

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,240
mentally rolling its eye at the obviousness of it all.

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,160
In split brains, right doesn't freak out because not a whole lot has really changed.

68
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,560
You might not agree and may be arguing right now why it can't be possible,

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
exactly as we would expect talking left brain to do.

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,040
Speculation aside, split brain patients show at the very least that in the mind,

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,160
there is a separate something that can hear and understand and respond,

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
given the right circumstances.

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,240
Your brain isn't entirely yours. Who is you? You is too.

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
But we can go deeper.

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
You are many.

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,040
The pile of meat that is your body is made up of trillions of tiny individuals

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,760
that have a life of their own, so at which point do the many become one.

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,720
What makes lots of tiny things? You.
