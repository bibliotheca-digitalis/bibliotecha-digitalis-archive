00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Your brain is two brains, two hemispheres, each doing half the work of being you.

00:05.440 --> 00:09.200
Half your vision goes to each and half your movement directed by each.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.200
Right controls left and left controls right.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.480
Your two brains coordinate through a wire of nerves, but this wire can be cut

00:16.480 --> 00:20.160
and was, for a time, used as an epilepsy treatment.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.960
After the cut, people seemed the same, though their brain was split in twain.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.360
Except some post-split patients described that while selecting their morning outfit

00:29.360 --> 00:32.800
with right hand, left might come along to disagree.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.200
Actually, left hand might quite often disagree,

00:35.200 --> 00:38.240
which these split-brain patients found frustrating.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.200
What's happening?

00:39.200 --> 00:42.880
To investigate, remember, right brain sees and controls one half

00:42.880 --> 00:45.520
while left brain controls and sees the other.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.680
But only left brain can speak.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.320
Hello.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.120
Because that's where the speech center is located.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.440
Right brain without this is mute.

00:53.440 --> 00:58.560
In normal brains, this doesn't matter because each half communicates across the wire with the other.

00:58.560 --> 01:03.040
But split-brains can't, and thus you can show just the right brain a word.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.920
Ask the person, what did you see, and you'll hear...

01:05.920 --> 01:06.480
Nothing.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.960
Because left-speaking brain saw nothing.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.400
Meanwhile, right brain will use its hand to pick the object out of a pile hidden from left brain.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.640
This is deeply creepy.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.640
Ask, why are you holding the object,

01:18.640 --> 01:23.040
and speaking left brain will make up a plausible sounding but totally wrong reason.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.120
I always wanted to learn how to solve one of these.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.400
Left brain isn't lying, it's just doing what brains do.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.320
Creating a story that explains its past actions to its current self.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.400
A behavior which does rather cast doubt onto the notion of free will,

01:36.400 --> 01:38.160
but that's a story for another time.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.000
Creating reasons for why it does things is just something left brains do.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.560
It happens in normal healthy humans all the time,

01:44.560 --> 01:47.200
and if you think about it closely, you know you've done this.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.160
Back to experiments.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.920
Give right brain an object, ask the person what's in your hand, and they won't be able to say.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.040
I'm not holding anything.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.640
And when asked to draw, a split brain can draw two separate objects simultaneously

02:00.640 --> 02:04.400
with each hand in a way unsplit brains find challenging.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.800
These experiments on split brain patients are deeply unsettling because they really

02:08.800 --> 02:15.520
point in the direction of a mute separate intelligence something living in the skull.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.160
You can even ask questions of a split brain and get disagreement on the answer.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.880
So if your brain is split, who is the you in this situation?

02:24.880 --> 02:29.920
From the outside, it's tempting to think of the part of the brain that's speaking as the person,

02:29.920 --> 02:33.040
but something is hearing and answering questions.

02:33.040 --> 02:38.560
And the right brain can't speak, it does understand faces, which left brain can't.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.520
If this is you, you don't know who your friends and family are in a crowd.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.760
This act of cutting exposes two minds in one head,

02:47.760 --> 02:52.160
and the talking mind doesn't know there's someone else in the house.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.800
The left brain can describe the situation it's in,

02:54.800 --> 03:00.080
but nonetheless will constantly be surprised by right brain's actions and explain them away.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.320
There's a question to be asked here.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.320
Why, after separation, does right brain not totally freak out,

03:06.320 --> 03:09.440
but instead plays along helpfully answering questions

03:09.440 --> 03:12.640
and listening to left brain's dumb stories about what's happening?

03:12.640 --> 03:14.720
It's the best pony? I don't know.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.560
Speculation time, but one answer is the cutting doesn't make right brain a separate

03:20.560 --> 03:26.080
intelligence, consciousness, person, but rather it has always been.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.720
In normal people, perhaps right brain grows up as a companion without a choice,

03:30.720 --> 03:32.720
feeling at first somewhat equal partners,

03:32.720 --> 03:35.360
but then as speech develops that it can't participate in,

03:35.360 --> 03:37.680
that increasingly becomes the central point of life,

03:37.680 --> 03:41.040
it resigns to mutely coordinate with left brain.

03:41.040 --> 03:45.920
At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.200
One having a mind equals blown moment and the other

03:49.200 --> 03:52.240
mentally rolling its eye at the obviousness of it all.

03:52.240 --> 03:58.160
In split brains, right doesn't freak out because not a whole lot has really changed.

03:58.160 --> 04:02.560
You might not agree and may be arguing right now why it can't be possible,

04:02.560 --> 04:05.920
exactly as we would expect talking left brain to do.

04:05.920 --> 04:11.040
Speculation aside, split brain patients show at the very least that in the mind,

04:11.040 --> 04:16.160
there is a separate something that can hear and understand and respond,

04:16.160 --> 04:17.920
given the right circumstances.

04:18.480 --> 04:24.240
Your brain isn't entirely yours. Who is you? You is too.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.760
But we can go deeper.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.880
You are many.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.040
The pile of meat that is your body is made up of trillions of tiny individuals

04:33.040 --> 04:37.760
that have a life of their own, so at which point do the many become one.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.720
What makes lots of tiny things? You.
