0	5440	Your brain is two brains, two hemispheres, each doing half the work of being you.
5440	9200	Half your vision goes to each and half your movement directed by each.
9200	11200	Right controls left and left controls right.
11200	16480	Your two brains coordinate through a wire of nerves, but this wire can be cut
16480	20160	and was, for a time, used as an epilepsy treatment.
20160	24960	After the cut, people seemed the same, though their brain was split in twain.
24960	29360	Except some post-split patients described that while selecting their morning outfit
29360	32800	with right hand, left might come along to disagree.
32800	35200	Actually, left hand might quite often disagree,
35200	38240	which these split-brain patients found frustrating.
38240	39200	What's happening?
39200	42880	To investigate, remember, right brain sees and controls one half
42880	45520	while left brain controls and sees the other.
45520	47680	But only left brain can speak.
47680	48320	Hello.
48320	51120	Because that's where the speech center is located.
51120	53440	Right brain without this is mute.
53440	58560	In normal brains, this doesn't matter because each half communicates across the wire with the other.
58560	63040	But split-brains can't, and thus you can show just the right brain a word.
63040	65920	Ask the person, what did you see, and you'll hear...
65920	66480	Nothing.
66480	68960	Because left-speaking brain saw nothing.
68960	74400	Meanwhile, right brain will use its hand to pick the object out of a pile hidden from left brain.
74400	76640	This is deeply creepy.
76640	78640	Ask, why are you holding the object,
78640	83040	and speaking left brain will make up a plausible sounding but totally wrong reason.
83040	85120	I always wanted to learn how to solve one of these.
85120	88400	Left brain isn't lying, it's just doing what brains do.
88400	92320	Creating a story that explains its past actions to its current self.
92320	96400	A behavior which does rather cast doubt onto the notion of free will,
96400	98160	but that's a story for another time.
98160	102000	Creating reasons for why it does things is just something left brains do.
102000	104560	It happens in normal healthy humans all the time,
104560	107200	and if you think about it closely, you know you've done this.
107200	108160	Back to experiments.
108160	113920	Give right brain an object, ask the person what's in your hand, and they won't be able to say.
113920	115040	I'm not holding anything.
115040	120640	And when asked to draw, a split brain can draw two separate objects simultaneously
120640	124400	with each hand in a way unsplit brains find challenging.
124400	128800	These experiments on split brain patients are deeply unsettling because they really
128800	135520	point in the direction of a mute separate intelligence something living in the skull.
135520	140160	You can even ask questions of a split brain and get disagreement on the answer.
140160	144880	So if your brain is split, who is the you in this situation?
144880	149920	From the outside, it's tempting to think of the part of the brain that's speaking as the person,
149920	153040	but something is hearing and answering questions.
153040	158560	And the right brain can't speak, it does understand faces, which left brain can't.
158560	163520	If this is you, you don't know who your friends and family are in a crowd.
163520	167760	This act of cutting exposes two minds in one head,
167760	172160	and the talking mind doesn't know there's someone else in the house.
172160	174800	The left brain can describe the situation it's in,
174800	180080	but nonetheless will constantly be surprised by right brain's actions and explain them away.
180080	182320	There's a question to be asked here.
182320	186320	Why, after separation, does right brain not totally freak out,
186320	189440	but instead plays along helpfully answering questions
189440	192640	and listening to left brain's dumb stories about what's happening?
192640	194720	It's the best pony? I don't know.
194720	200560	Speculation time, but one answer is the cutting doesn't make right brain a separate
200560	206080	intelligence, consciousness, person, but rather it has always been.
206080	210720	In normal people, perhaps right brain grows up as a companion without a choice,
210720	212720	feeling at first somewhat equal partners,
212720	215360	but then as speech develops that it can't participate in,
215360	217680	that increasingly becomes the central point of life,
217680	221040	it resigns to mutely coordinate with left brain.
221040	225920	At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video.
225920	229200	One having a mind equals blown moment and the other
229200	232240	mentally rolling its eye at the obviousness of it all.
232240	238160	In split brains, right doesn't freak out because not a whole lot has really changed.
238160	242560	You might not agree and may be arguing right now why it can't be possible,
242560	245920	exactly as we would expect talking left brain to do.
245920	251040	Speculation aside, split brain patients show at the very least that in the mind,
251040	256160	there is a separate something that can hear and understand and respond,
256160	257920	given the right circumstances.
258480	264240	Your brain isn't entirely yours. Who is you? You is too.
266400	267760	But we can go deeper.
267760	268880	You are many.
268880	273040	The pile of meat that is your body is made up of trillions of tiny individuals
273040	277760	that have a life of their own, so at which point do the many become one.
277760	280720	What makes lots of tiny things? You.
