1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Vegas, baby, it's Paradise.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,340
Not metaphorically either, this literally isn't the city of Las Vegas.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,320
Look at a map and you'll see the name Paradise and when you visit and check the weather,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
same thing.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,440
Here is Las Vegas and here is Paradise which contains nearly everything people associate

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,100
with Las Vegas, including the sign.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,040
Now you might think Paradise is just a relatively unknown city mistaken for its larger neighbor

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,480
like elsewhere, but Paradise isn't a city at all.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,760
It's an unincorporated place.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,480
Just that, quick government recap.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,960
Citizens living in a city have to follow the rules of the city and also those of the county

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,680
and also the state and also the nation.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,320
It's a government layer cake.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
And each layer collects its own taxes to enforce its own rules.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If some folk find these layers oppressive, they can hitch their wagons and head for open

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,160
lands outside the borders of any city to live like the rugged individualists they are, free

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
of rules.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,520
Well, except for those of the nation and also the state and also the county.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,200
But moving outside a city, there's one fewer and also layer because they are in an unincorporated

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
place.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,480
But if they make it nice and the population grows, inevitably people want police and sewers

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,720
and schools and rules and soon a charter is written, a mayor elected and a city incorporated.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,800
What makes Paradise weird is that unlike most unincorporated places that contain mostly

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,160
blowing tumbleweeds and perhaps a yurt where nobody wants to live, there are almost a quarter

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,520
million residents in Paradise in a space the size of Disney World.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,640
That density is way past the point you'd expect people to incorporate a city and it's not

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,420
like Paradisians just couldn't bother.

28
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,180
Paradise is almost unique in being officially unincorporated.

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
So why?

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,500
It started with the Mormons who first settled these lands in the 1880s.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,880
Actually no, jump cut to 1950 when we still tested out nuclear bombs in the open near

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
population centers.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,360
Nevada recently legalized gambling and a casino empire grew in Vegas, well just outside of

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,520
it to avoid city taxes.

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,960
As for necessary services, the casinos were rich enough to provide their own, notably

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,440
using their security forces as de facto police.

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,500
Which might not sound on the up and up but this was the mob running things and of course

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,360
they don't anymore.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,200
Actually really they don't, it's all run by about two companies now.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,440
Anyway, the official city of Las Vegas in the 1950s was on the verge of bankruptcy and

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
with profitable casinos touching its border, the mayor was all like, who are you kidding?

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,400
This is totally part of Las Vegas because I say so and you're going to pay Las Vegas

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
taxes.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,660
The casinos said no.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,680
It was a dispute that only the county, the next level of government up, could resolve.

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,820
The casinos by the way paid taxes to the county direct.

47
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,300
So shockingly the county told Vegas, no you can't annex this land and tax its businesses

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,840
just because you want to.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,160
But to prevent Vegas from trying anything funny in the future, the county created the

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,280
officially, unofficially incorporated place named Paradise.

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,240
Everything that happens within its borders the actual city of Las Vegas has no control

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
over.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,000
Here the county rules and sets lower taxes of all sorts which is why when new casinos

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,740
are built it's generally in Paradise, not Las Vegas.

55
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,960
But if this makes you think that the origin of Paradise was just some kind of city size

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,600
tax dodge, you're right.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,360
Now, before you go around correcting everybody that your vacation was in Paradise, not Las

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,320
Vegas, Las Vegas City and Paradise are both in Las Vegas Valley.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,280
So you can say you went to Las Vegas while never setting foot in Las Vegas and still

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,840
be technically correct that you went to Las Vegas.
