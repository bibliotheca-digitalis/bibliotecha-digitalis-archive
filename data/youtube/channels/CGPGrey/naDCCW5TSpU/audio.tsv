0	2720	Vegas, baby, it's Paradise.
2720	6340	Not metaphorically either, this literally isn't the city of Las Vegas.
6340	10320	Look at a map and you'll see the name Paradise and when you visit and check the weather,
10320	11320	same thing.
11320	16440	Here is Las Vegas and here is Paradise which contains nearly everything people associate
16440	19100	with Las Vegas, including the sign.
19100	24040	Now you might think Paradise is just a relatively unknown city mistaken for its larger neighbor
24040	27480	like elsewhere, but Paradise isn't a city at all.
27480	29760	It's an unincorporated place.
29760	31480	Just that, quick government recap.
31480	35960	Citizens living in a city have to follow the rules of the city and also those of the county
35960	38680	and also the state and also the nation.
38680	40320	It's a government layer cake.
40320	44000	And each layer collects its own taxes to enforce its own rules.
44000	48000	If some folk find these layers oppressive, they can hitch their wagons and head for open
48000	53160	lands outside the borders of any city to live like the rugged individualists they are, free
53160	54160	of rules.
54160	58520	Well, except for those of the nation and also the state and also the county.
58520	64200	But moving outside a city, there's one fewer and also layer because they are in an unincorporated
64200	65200	place.
65200	69480	But if they make it nice and the population grows, inevitably people want police and sewers
69480	74720	and schools and rules and soon a charter is written, a mayor elected and a city incorporated.
74720	79800	What makes Paradise weird is that unlike most unincorporated places that contain mostly
79800	85160	blowing tumbleweeds and perhaps a yurt where nobody wants to live, there are almost a quarter
85160	89520	million residents in Paradise in a space the size of Disney World.
89520	94640	That density is way past the point you'd expect people to incorporate a city and it's not
94640	97420	like Paradisians just couldn't bother.
97420	101180	Paradise is almost unique in being officially unincorporated.
101180	102180	So why?
102180	105500	It started with the Mormons who first settled these lands in the 1880s.
105500	110880	Actually no, jump cut to 1950 when we still tested out nuclear bombs in the open near
110880	112240	population centers.
112320	118360	Nevada recently legalized gambling and a casino empire grew in Vegas, well just outside of
118360	120520	it to avoid city taxes.
120520	124960	As for necessary services, the casinos were rich enough to provide their own, notably
124960	128440	using their security forces as de facto police.
128440	132500	Which might not sound on the up and up but this was the mob running things and of course
132500	134360	they don't anymore.
134360	137200	Actually really they don't, it's all run by about two companies now.
137200	141440	Anyway, the official city of Las Vegas in the 1950s was on the verge of bankruptcy and
141440	145760	with profitable casinos touching its border, the mayor was all like, who are you kidding?
145760	150400	This is totally part of Las Vegas because I say so and you're going to pay Las Vegas
150400	151400	taxes.
151400	152660	The casinos said no.
152660	156680	It was a dispute that only the county, the next level of government up, could resolve.
156680	159820	The casinos by the way paid taxes to the county direct.
159820	165300	So shockingly the county told Vegas, no you can't annex this land and tax its businesses
165300	166840	just because you want to.
166840	171160	But to prevent Vegas from trying anything funny in the future, the county created the
171160	175280	officially, unofficially incorporated place named Paradise.
175280	180240	Everything that happens within its borders the actual city of Las Vegas has no control
180240	181240	over.
181240	186000	Here the county rules and sets lower taxes of all sorts which is why when new casinos
186000	189740	are built it's generally in Paradise, not Las Vegas.
189740	193960	But if this makes you think that the origin of Paradise was just some kind of city size
193960	195600	tax dodge, you're right.
196840	202360	Now, before you go around correcting everybody that your vacation was in Paradise, not Las
202360	206320	Vegas, Las Vegas City and Paradise are both in Las Vegas Valley.
206320	210280	So you can say you went to Las Vegas while never setting foot in Las Vegas and still
210280	212840	be technically correct that you went to Las Vegas.
