00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Vegas, baby, it's Paradise.

00:02.720 --> 00:06.340
Not metaphorically either, this literally isn't the city of Las Vegas.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.320
Look at a map and you'll see the name Paradise and when you visit and check the weather,

00:10.320 --> 00:11.320
same thing.

00:11.320 --> 00:16.440
Here is Las Vegas and here is Paradise which contains nearly everything people associate

00:16.440 --> 00:19.100
with Las Vegas, including the sign.

00:19.100 --> 00:24.040
Now you might think Paradise is just a relatively unknown city mistaken for its larger neighbor

00:24.040 --> 00:27.480
like elsewhere, but Paradise isn't a city at all.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.760
It's an unincorporated place.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.480
Just that, quick government recap.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.960
Citizens living in a city have to follow the rules of the city and also those of the county

00:35.960 --> 00:38.680
and also the state and also the nation.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.320
It's a government layer cake.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.000
And each layer collects its own taxes to enforce its own rules.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
If some folk find these layers oppressive, they can hitch their wagons and head for open

00:48.000 --> 00:53.160
lands outside the borders of any city to live like the rugged individualists they are, free

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
of rules.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.520
Well, except for those of the nation and also the state and also the county.

00:58.520 --> 01:04.200
But moving outside a city, there's one fewer and also layer because they are in an unincorporated

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
place.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.480
But if they make it nice and the population grows, inevitably people want police and sewers

01:09.480 --> 01:14.720
and schools and rules and soon a charter is written, a mayor elected and a city incorporated.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.800
What makes Paradise weird is that unlike most unincorporated places that contain mostly

01:19.800 --> 01:25.160
blowing tumbleweeds and perhaps a yurt where nobody wants to live, there are almost a quarter

01:25.160 --> 01:29.520
million residents in Paradise in a space the size of Disney World.

01:29.520 --> 01:34.640
That density is way past the point you'd expect people to incorporate a city and it's not

01:34.640 --> 01:37.420
like Paradisians just couldn't bother.

01:37.420 --> 01:41.180
Paradise is almost unique in being officially unincorporated.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.180
So why?

01:42.180 --> 01:45.500
It started with the Mormons who first settled these lands in the 1880s.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.880
Actually no, jump cut to 1950 when we still tested out nuclear bombs in the open near

01:50.880 --> 01:52.240
population centers.

01:52.320 --> 01:58.360
Nevada recently legalized gambling and a casino empire grew in Vegas, well just outside of

01:58.360 --> 02:00.520
it to avoid city taxes.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.960
As for necessary services, the casinos were rich enough to provide their own, notably

02:04.960 --> 02:08.440
using their security forces as de facto police.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.500
Which might not sound on the up and up but this was the mob running things and of course

02:12.500 --> 02:14.360
they don't anymore.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.200
Actually really they don't, it's all run by about two companies now.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.440
Anyway, the official city of Las Vegas in the 1950s was on the verge of bankruptcy and

02:21.440 --> 02:25.760
with profitable casinos touching its border, the mayor was all like, who are you kidding?

02:25.760 --> 02:30.400
This is totally part of Las Vegas because I say so and you're going to pay Las Vegas

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
taxes.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.660
The casinos said no.

02:32.660 --> 02:36.680
It was a dispute that only the county, the next level of government up, could resolve.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.820
The casinos by the way paid taxes to the county direct.

02:39.820 --> 02:45.300
So shockingly the county told Vegas, no you can't annex this land and tax its businesses

02:45.300 --> 02:46.840
just because you want to.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.160
But to prevent Vegas from trying anything funny in the future, the county created the

02:51.160 --> 02:55.280
officially, unofficially incorporated place named Paradise.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.240
Everything that happens within its borders the actual city of Las Vegas has no control

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
over.

03:01.240 --> 03:06.000
Here the county rules and sets lower taxes of all sorts which is why when new casinos

03:06.000 --> 03:09.740
are built it's generally in Paradise, not Las Vegas.

03:09.740 --> 03:13.960
But if this makes you think that the origin of Paradise was just some kind of city size

03:13.960 --> 03:15.600
tax dodge, you're right.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.360
Now, before you go around correcting everybody that your vacation was in Paradise, not Las

03:22.360 --> 03:26.320
Vegas, Las Vegas City and Paradise are both in Las Vegas Valley.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.280
So you can say you went to Las Vegas while never setting foot in Las Vegas and still

03:30.280 --> 03:32.840
be technically correct that you went to Las Vegas.
