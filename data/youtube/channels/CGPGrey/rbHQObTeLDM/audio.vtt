Hello, Internet.

00:00.880 --> 00:07.020
Each final finished, precisely polished video you see stands atop a mountain of material you don't.

00:07.020 --> 00:09.800
Books and papers and sometimes investigative travels,

00:09.800 --> 00:15.020
time lost and confused in the infinite diverging paths of the forest of all knowledge,

00:15.020 --> 00:17.640
writing a script to try to light the way.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.940
The final video takes hundreds of human hours to carefully craft.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.320
The whole mountain couldn't possibly fit in, otherwise there would never be a video.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.920
But what has to be left out is sometimes heartbreaking,

00:28.920 --> 00:34.540
not to mention the easter eggs and little details that are put in, but can easily go unnoticed.

00:34.540 --> 00:38.620
So I'm going to talk about some of the behind-the-scenes in a more casual,

00:38.620 --> 00:41.720
force-myself-not-to-prepare-too-much-otherwise-it'll-never-happen,

00:41.720 --> 00:47.020
director's commentary for crowdfunders who make all of this possible in the first place.

00:47.020 --> 00:51.480
If, when you clicked this video, the thumbnail said Live, then it's live right now.

00:51.480 --> 00:56.480
I'm director commenting, and you can join the chat to ask questions about the newest video.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.080
If there was no Live, then you can watch the archive of previous ones.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.740

01:04.740 --> 01:06.740
I hope you like them, and thank you.
