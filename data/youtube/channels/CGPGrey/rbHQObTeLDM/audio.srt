Hello, Internet.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,020
Each final finished, precisely polished video you see stands atop a mountain of material you don't.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,800
Books and papers and sometimes investigative travels,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,020
time lost and confused in the infinite diverging paths of the forest of all knowledge,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,640
writing a script to try to light the way.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,940
The final video takes hundreds of human hours to carefully craft.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,320
The whole mountain couldn't possibly fit in, otherwise there would never be a video.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,920
But what has to be left out is sometimes heartbreaking,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,540
not to mention the easter eggs and little details that are put in, but can easily go unnoticed.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,620
So I'm going to talk about some of the behind-the-scenes in a more casual,

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,720
force-myself-not-to-prepare-too-much-otherwise-it'll-never-happen,

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,020
director's commentary for crowdfunders who make all of this possible in the first place.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,480
If, when you clicked this video, the thumbnail said Live, then it's live right now.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm director commenting, and you can join the chat to ask questions about the newest video.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,080
If there was no Live, then you can watch the archive of previous ones.

00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,740
