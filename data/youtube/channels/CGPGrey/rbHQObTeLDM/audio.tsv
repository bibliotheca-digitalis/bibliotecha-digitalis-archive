0	880	Hello, Internet.
880	7020	Each final finished, precisely polished video you see stands atop a mountain of material you don't.
7020	9800	Books and papers and sometimes investigative travels,
9800	15020	time lost and confused in the infinite diverging paths of the forest of all knowledge,
15020	17640	writing a script to try to light the way.
17640	21940	The final video takes hundreds of human hours to carefully craft.
21940	26320	The whole mountain couldn't possibly fit in, otherwise there would never be a video.
26320	28920	But what has to be left out is sometimes heartbreaking,
28920	34540	not to mention the easter eggs and little details that are put in, but can easily go unnoticed.
34540	38620	So I'm going to talk about some of the behind-the-scenes in a more casual,
38620	41720	force-myself-not-to-prepare-too-much-otherwise-it'll-never-happen,

47020	51480	If, when you clicked this video, the thumbnail said Live, then it's live right now.
51480	56480	I'm director commenting, and you can join the chat to ask questions about the newest video.
56480	60080	If there was no Live, then you can watch the archive of previous ones.
