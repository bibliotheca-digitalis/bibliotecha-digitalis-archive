00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
A calendar year is made of 365 days, a number that refuses to be divided nicely, which is

00:05.280 --> 00:09.680
why we end up with uneven months of either 30 or 31 days, except for February, the runt

00:09.680 --> 00:11.960
of the litter, which gets only 28.

00:11.960 --> 00:15.860
Except when it gets 29, and then the year is 366 days long.

00:15.860 --> 00:16.860
Why does that happen?

00:16.860 --> 00:19.640
What kind of crazy universe do we live in where some years are longer than others?

00:19.640 --> 00:22.200
To answer this, we need to know, just what is a year?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.560
Way over simplifying it, a year is the time it takes the Earth to make one trip around

00:25.560 --> 00:26.560
the Sun.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.560
This happens to line up with a cycle of the seasons.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.660
Now drawing a little diagram like this showing the Earth jauntily going around the Sun is

00:31.660 --> 00:35.200
easy to do, but accurately tracking a year is tricky when you're on Earth because the

00:35.200 --> 00:37.420
universe doesn't provide an overhead map.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.480
On Earth you only get to see the seasons change, and the obvious way to keep track of their

00:40.480 --> 00:45.260
comings and goings is to count the days passing, which gives you a 365 day calendar.

00:45.260 --> 00:49.200
But as soon as you start to use that calendar, it slowly gets out of sync with the seasons,

00:49.200 --> 00:52.320
and with each passing year the gap gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.440
In three decades the calendar will be off by a week, and in a few hundred years the

00:55.440 --> 00:58.760
seasons would be flipped, meaning Christmas celebrations taking place in summer, which

00:58.760 --> 01:00.080
would be crazy.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
Why does this happen?

01:01.080 --> 01:02.080
Did we count the days wrong?

01:02.080 --> 01:04.840
Well, the calendar predicts that the time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun

01:04.840 --> 01:09.920
is 8760 hours, but if you actually timed it with a stopwatch you'd see that a year is

01:09.920 --> 01:13.800
really longer than the calendar predicts by almost six hours, so our calendar is moving

01:13.800 --> 01:17.000
ever so slightly faster than the seasons actually change.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.520
And thus we come to the fundamental problem of all calendars.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.740
The day-night cycle, while easy to count, has nothing to do with the yearly cycle.

01:23.740 --> 01:26.300
Day and night are caused by Earth rotating about its axis.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.180
When you're on the side facing the Sun, it's daytime, and when you're on the other side

01:29.180 --> 01:30.180
it's night.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.380
But this rotation is no more connected to the orbital motion around the Sun than a ballerina

01:33.380 --> 01:36.600
spinning on the back of a truck is connected to the truck's cruising speed.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.180
Counting the number of ballerina turns to predict how long the truck takes to drive

01:39.180 --> 01:43.340
in a circle might give you a rough idea, but it's crazy to expect it to be precise.

01:43.340 --> 01:46.460
Counting the days to track the orbit is pretty much the same thing, and so it shouldn't be

01:46.460 --> 01:50.980
a surprise when the Earth doesn't happen to make 365 complete spins in a year.

01:50.980 --> 01:56.300
Rotatingly, while 365 days are too few, 366 days are too many, and still cause the seasons

01:56.300 --> 01:58.740
to drift out of sync, just in the opposite way.

01:58.740 --> 02:02.060
The solution to all this is the leap year, where February gets an extra day, but only

02:02.060 --> 02:03.440
every four years.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.040
This works pretty well, as each year the calendar is about a quarter day short, so after four

02:07.040 --> 02:09.340
years you add an extra day to get back in alignment.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.380
Huzzah, the problem has been solved.

02:11.380 --> 02:12.380
Except it hasn't.

02:12.380 --> 02:15.740
Lengthening the calendar by one day every four years is slightly too much, and the calendar

02:15.740 --> 02:19.560
still falls behind the seasons at a rate of one day per hundred years, which is fine for

02:19.560 --> 02:23.680
the apathetic, but not for calendar designers who want everything to line up perfectly.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.740
To fix the irregularity, every century the leap year is skipped.

02:26.740 --> 02:30.540
So 1896 and 1904 were leap years, but 1900 wasn't.

02:30.540 --> 02:34.240
This is better, but still leaves the calendar ever so slightly too fast, with an error of

02:34.240 --> 02:36.000
one day and four hundred years.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.440
So an additional clause is added to the skip the century rule, that if the century is divisible

02:39.440 --> 02:41.860
by four hundred, then it will be a leap year.

02:41.860 --> 02:45.160
So 1900 and 2100 aren't leap years, but 2000 is.

02:45.160 --> 02:49.160
With these three rules, the error is now just one day off and almost eight thousand years,

02:49.160 --> 02:52.560
which the current calendar declares mission accomplished and so calls it a day.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.380
Which is probably quite reasonable, because eight thousand years ago, humans were just

02:55.380 --> 02:58.600
figuring out that farming might be a good idea, and eight thousand years from now we'll

02:58.600 --> 03:01.540
hopefully be using a calendar with a better date tracking system.

03:01.540 --> 03:06.480
But perhaps you're a mathematician and a 0.0001% error is an abomination in your eyes and must

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
be removed.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.360
Tough luck says the universe, because the length of a day isn't even consistent.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.920
It randomly varies a few milliseconds on average and very slowly decreases by about one millisecond

03:14.920 --> 03:18.800
per hundred years, which means it's literally impossible to build a perfect calendar that

03:18.840 --> 03:19.960
lasts forever.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.080
In theory the length of a day will expand to be as long as the current month, but don't

03:23.080 --> 03:27.000
worry in practice it will take tens of billions of years and our own expanding sun will destroy

03:27.000 --> 03:28.880
the earth long before that happens.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.120
Sorry not quite sure how we got from counting the days of the months to the fiery unavoidable

03:32.120 --> 03:35.880
end of all human civilization, unless of course we have an adequately funded space program,

03:35.880 --> 03:36.880
hint hint.

03:36.880 --> 03:37.880
But there you have it.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.400
For the next eight millennia, leap years will keep the calendar in sync with the seasons

03:40.400 --> 03:43.880
but in a surprisingly complicated way.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.040
You can learn a lot more about orbits, different kinds of years, and supermassive black holes

03:47.040 --> 03:48.200
over at MinutePhysics.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.080
As always, Henry does a great job of explaining it all in his new video.
