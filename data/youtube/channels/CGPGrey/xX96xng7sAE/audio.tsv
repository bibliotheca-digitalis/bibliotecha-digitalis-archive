0	5280	A calendar year is made of 365 days, a number that refuses to be divided nicely, which is
5280	9680	why we end up with uneven months of either 30 or 31 days, except for February, the runt
9680	11960	of the litter, which gets only 28.
11960	15860	Except when it gets 29, and then the year is 366 days long.
15860	16860	Why does that happen?
16860	19640	What kind of crazy universe do we live in where some years are longer than others?
19640	22200	To answer this, we need to know, just what is a year?
22200	25560	Way over simplifying it, a year is the time it takes the Earth to make one trip around
25560	26560	the Sun.
26560	28560	This happens to line up with a cycle of the seasons.
28560	31660	Now drawing a little diagram like this showing the Earth jauntily going around the Sun is
31660	35200	easy to do, but accurately tracking a year is tricky when you're on Earth because the
35200	37420	universe doesn't provide an overhead map.
37420	40480	On Earth you only get to see the seasons change, and the obvious way to keep track of their
40480	45260	comings and goings is to count the days passing, which gives you a 365 day calendar.
45260	49200	But as soon as you start to use that calendar, it slowly gets out of sync with the seasons,
49200	52320	and with each passing year the gap gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
52320	55440	In three decades the calendar will be off by a week, and in a few hundred years the
55440	58760	seasons would be flipped, meaning Christmas celebrations taking place in summer, which
58760	60080	would be crazy.
60080	61080	Why does this happen?
61080	62080	Did we count the days wrong?
62080	64840	Well, the calendar predicts that the time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun
64840	69920	is 8760 hours, but if you actually timed it with a stopwatch you'd see that a year is
69920	73800	really longer than the calendar predicts by almost six hours, so our calendar is moving
73800	77000	ever so slightly faster than the seasons actually change.
77000	79520	And thus we come to the fundamental problem of all calendars.
79520	83740	The day-night cycle, while easy to count, has nothing to do with the yearly cycle.
83740	86300	Day and night are caused by Earth rotating about its axis.
86300	89180	When you're on the side facing the Sun, it's daytime, and when you're on the other side
89180	90180	it's night.
90180	93380	But this rotation is no more connected to the orbital motion around the Sun than a ballerina
93380	96600	spinning on the back of a truck is connected to the truck's cruising speed.
96600	99180	Counting the number of ballerina turns to predict how long the truck takes to drive
99180	103340	in a circle might give you a rough idea, but it's crazy to expect it to be precise.
103340	106460	Counting the days to track the orbit is pretty much the same thing, and so it shouldn't be
106460	110980	a surprise when the Earth doesn't happen to make 365 complete spins in a year.
110980	116300	Rotatingly, while 365 days are too few, 366 days are too many, and still cause the seasons
116300	118740	to drift out of sync, just in the opposite way.
118740	122060	The solution to all this is the leap year, where February gets an extra day, but only
122060	123440	every four years.
123440	127040	This works pretty well, as each year the calendar is about a quarter day short, so after four
127040	129340	years you add an extra day to get back in alignment.
129340	131380	Huzzah, the problem has been solved.
131380	132380	Except it hasn't.
132380	135740	Lengthening the calendar by one day every four years is slightly too much, and the calendar
135740	139560	still falls behind the seasons at a rate of one day per hundred years, which is fine for
139560	143680	the apathetic, but not for calendar designers who want everything to line up perfectly.
143680	146740	To fix the irregularity, every century the leap year is skipped.
146740	150540	So 1896 and 1904 were leap years, but 1900 wasn't.
150540	154240	This is better, but still leaves the calendar ever so slightly too fast, with an error of
154240	156000	one day and four hundred years.
156000	159440	So an additional clause is added to the skip the century rule, that if the century is divisible
159440	161860	by four hundred, then it will be a leap year.
161860	165160	So 1900 and 2100 aren't leap years, but 2000 is.
165160	169160	With these three rules, the error is now just one day off and almost eight thousand years,
169160	172560	which the current calendar declares mission accomplished and so calls it a day.
172560	175380	Which is probably quite reasonable, because eight thousand years ago, humans were just
175380	178600	figuring out that farming might be a good idea, and eight thousand years from now we'll
178600	181540	hopefully be using a calendar with a better date tracking system.
181540	186480	But perhaps you're a mathematician and a 0.0001% error is an abomination in your eyes and must
186480	187480	be removed.
187480	190360	Tough luck says the universe, because the length of a day isn't even consistent.
190360	194920	It randomly varies a few milliseconds on average and very slowly decreases by about one millisecond
194920	198800	per hundred years, which means it's literally impossible to build a perfect calendar that
198840	199960	lasts forever.
199960	203080	In theory the length of a day will expand to be as long as the current month, but don't
203080	207000	worry in practice it will take tens of billions of years and our own expanding sun will destroy
207000	208880	the earth long before that happens.
208880	212120	Sorry not quite sure how we got from counting the days of the months to the fiery unavoidable
212120	215880	end of all human civilization, unless of course we have an adequately funded space program,
215880	216880	hint hint.
216880	217880	But there you have it.
217880	220400	For the next eight millennia, leap years will keep the calendar in sync with the seasons
220400	223880	but in a surprisingly complicated way.
