1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
A calendar year is made of 365 days, a number that refuses to be divided nicely, which is

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,680
why we end up with uneven months of either 30 or 31 days, except for February, the runt

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,960
of the litter, which gets only 28.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,860
Except when it gets 29, and then the year is 366 days long.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,860
Why does that happen?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,640
What kind of crazy universe do we live in where some years are longer than others?

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,200
To answer this, we need to know, just what is a year?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,560
Way over simplifying it, a year is the time it takes the Earth to make one trip around

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
the Sun.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,560
This happens to line up with a cycle of the seasons.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,660
Now drawing a little diagram like this showing the Earth jauntily going around the Sun is

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,200
easy to do, but accurately tracking a year is tricky when you're on Earth because the

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,420
universe doesn't provide an overhead map.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,480
On Earth you only get to see the seasons change, and the obvious way to keep track of their

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,260
comings and goings is to count the days passing, which gives you a 365 day calendar.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,200
But as soon as you start to use that calendar, it slowly gets out of sync with the seasons,

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,320
and with each passing year the gap gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
In three decades the calendar will be off by a week, and in a few hundred years the

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,760
seasons would be flipped, meaning Christmas celebrations taking place in summer, which

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,080
would be crazy.

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Why does this happen?

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
Did we count the days wrong?

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,840
Well, the calendar predicts that the time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,920
is 8760 hours, but if you actually timed it with a stopwatch you'd see that a year is

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,800
really longer than the calendar predicts by almost six hours, so our calendar is moving

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,000
ever so slightly faster than the seasons actually change.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,520
And thus we come to the fundamental problem of all calendars.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,740
The day-night cycle, while easy to count, has nothing to do with the yearly cycle.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,300
Day and night are caused by Earth rotating about its axis.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,180
When you're on the side facing the Sun, it's daytime, and when you're on the other side

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,180
it's night.

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,380
But this rotation is no more connected to the orbital motion around the Sun than a ballerina

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,600
spinning on the back of a truck is connected to the truck's cruising speed.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,180
Counting the number of ballerina turns to predict how long the truck takes to drive

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,340
in a circle might give you a rough idea, but it's crazy to expect it to be precise.

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,460
Counting the days to track the orbit is pretty much the same thing, and so it shouldn't be

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,980
a surprise when the Earth doesn't happen to make 365 complete spins in a year.

38
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,300
Rotatingly, while 365 days are too few, 366 days are too many, and still cause the seasons

39
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,740
to drift out of sync, just in the opposite way.

40
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,060
The solution to all this is the leap year, where February gets an extra day, but only

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,440
every four years.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,040
This works pretty well, as each year the calendar is about a quarter day short, so after four

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,340
years you add an extra day to get back in alignment.

44
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,380
Huzzah, the problem has been solved.

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Except it hasn't.

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,740
Lengthening the calendar by one day every four years is slightly too much, and the calendar

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,560
still falls behind the seasons at a rate of one day per hundred years, which is fine for

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,680
the apathetic, but not for calendar designers who want everything to line up perfectly.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,740
To fix the irregularity, every century the leap year is skipped.

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,540
So 1896 and 1904 were leap years, but 1900 wasn't.

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,240
This is better, but still leaves the calendar ever so slightly too fast, with an error of

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
one day and four hundred years.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,440
So an additional clause is added to the skip the century rule, that if the century is divisible

54
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,860
by four hundred, then it will be a leap year.

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,160
So 1900 and 2100 aren't leap years, but 2000 is.

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,160
With these three rules, the error is now just one day off and almost eight thousand years,

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,560
which the current calendar declares mission accomplished and so calls it a day.

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,380
Which is probably quite reasonable, because eight thousand years ago, humans were just

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,600
figuring out that farming might be a good idea, and eight thousand years from now we'll

60
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,540
hopefully be using a calendar with a better date tracking system.

61
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,480
But perhaps you're a mathematician and a 0.0001% error is an abomination in your eyes and must

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
be removed.

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,360
Tough luck says the universe, because the length of a day isn't even consistent.

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,920
It randomly varies a few milliseconds on average and very slowly decreases by about one millisecond

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,800
per hundred years, which means it's literally impossible to build a perfect calendar that

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
lasts forever.

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,080
In theory the length of a day will expand to be as long as the current month, but don't

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
worry in practice it will take tens of billions of years and our own expanding sun will destroy

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,880
the earth long before that happens.

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,120
Sorry not quite sure how we got from counting the days of the months to the fiery unavoidable

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,880
end of all human civilization, unless of course we have an adequately funded space program,

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
hint hint.

73
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
But there you have it.

74
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,400
For the next eight millennia, leap years will keep the calendar in sync with the seasons

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,880
but in a surprisingly complicated way.

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,040
You can learn a lot more about orbits, different kinds of years, and supermassive black holes

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,200
over at MinutePhysics.

78
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,080
As always, Henry does a great job of explaining it all in his new video.
