Hi YouTube. Well, that was fast. At the end of January I made a video thanking the first

00:05.360 --> 00:09.180
100,000 subscribers for joining my channel and now, just 3 months later, the subscribers

00:09.180 --> 00:12.640
have been doubled, which is an unbelievable rate of growth so thank you so much to everyone

00:12.640 --> 00:16.080
who's joined up with me on this little corner of the internet. These last 3 months have

00:16.080 --> 00:19.780
been a crazy, busy time for me with too many projects going on at once and the next 3 months

00:19.780 --> 00:23.600
will probably be the same with more videos and other stuff on the way. But one project

00:23.600 --> 00:26.720
that's finished now, thanks to Hank Green, a man who himself runs so many different things

00:26.720 --> 00:30.400
it's hard to keep track of them all, is the CGP Grey shirt which is now available on the

00:30.400 --> 00:34.180
DFTBA store. In case you're wondering, the proceeds of the shirt will be used to purchase

00:34.180 --> 00:38.000
coffee. That coffee will fuel the typing and clicking needed to manufacture videos, videos

00:38.000 --> 00:41.380
which may contain links to buy the very shirts that brought them into existence, thus completing

00:41.380 --> 00:45.320
the circle of life. So go grab one today if you'd like to support the channel. It's been

00:45.320 --> 00:48.380
amazing making videos for you and watching the channel grow, though now releasing each

00:48.380 --> 00:53.080
video to so many people is slightly intimidating. Even though I take far, far too long researching

00:53.080 --> 00:56.340
each one, I still spend the first few minutes after uploading Living in Fear that I've made

00:56.340 --> 00:59.820
some unintentional error and waiting for the inevitable comment pointing out where

00:59.820 --> 01:03.380
I've made a typo. And there are always typos.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.680
But terror of errors aside, the nice thing about having such a large community is being

01:06.680 --> 01:10.400
able to share not only my own stuff with you, but also other people's videos, either through

01:10.400 --> 01:14.120
hidden links on my own or in separate playlists like the one I've made this week. Though on

01:14.120 --> 01:17.900
these videos I've noticed people often leave comments like Grey's army coming through and

01:17.900 --> 01:22.260
I'm not sure that an army is the best representation of who we are. I'm more a science and technology

01:22.260 --> 01:25.860
guy who likes reason and simple things that turn complex in interesting ways. And since

01:25.900 --> 01:28.860
you're here watching these videos, I assume you are as well. I'm not sure what the best

01:28.860 --> 01:32.140
collective noun for this growing community is, but if you have any thoughts I'd love

01:32.140 --> 01:36.260
to hear them. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. You are the reason I can continue to make

01:36.260 --> 01:39.340
these videos. Thank you for watching and thank you for subscribing.
