{"text": " Hi YouTube. Well, that was fast. At the end of January I made a video thanking the first 100,000 subscribers for joining my channel and now, just 3 months later, the subscribers have been doubled, which is an unbelievable rate of growth so thank you so much to everyone who's joined up with me on this little corner of the internet. These last 3 months have been a crazy, busy time for me with too many projects going on at once and the next 3 months will probably be the same with more videos and other stuff on the way. But one project that's finished now, thanks to Hank Green, a man who himself runs so many different things it's hard to keep track of them all, is the CGP Grey shirt which is now available on the DFTBA store. In case you're wondering, the proceeds of the shirt will be used to purchase coffee. That coffee will fuel the typing and clicking needed to manufacture videos, videos which may contain links to buy the very shirts that brought them into existence, thus completing the circle of life. So go grab one today if you'd like to support the channel. It's been amazing making videos for you and watching the channel grow, though now releasing each video to so many people is slightly intimidating. Even though I take far, far too long researching each one, I still spend the first few minutes after uploading Living in Fear that I've made some unintentional error and waiting for the inevitable comment pointing out where I've made a typo. And there are always typos. But terror of errors aside, the nice thing about having such a large community is being able to share not only my own stuff with you, but also other people's videos, either through hidden links on my own or in separate playlists like the one I've made this week. Though on these videos I've noticed people often leave comments like Grey's army coming through and I'm not sure that an army is the best representation of who we are. I'm more a science and technology guy who likes reason and simple things that turn complex in interesting ways. And since you're here watching these videos, I assume you are as well. I'm not sure what the best collective noun for this growing community is, but if you have any thoughts I'd love to hear them. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. You are the reason I can continue to make these videos. Thank you for watching and thank you for subscribing.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.36, "text": " Hi YouTube.
