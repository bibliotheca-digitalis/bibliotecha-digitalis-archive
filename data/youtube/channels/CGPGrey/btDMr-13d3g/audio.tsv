0	5360	Hi YouTube. Well, that was fast. At the end of January I made a video thanking the first
5360	9180	100,000 subscribers for joining my channel and now, just 3 months later, the subscribers
9180	12640	have been doubled, which is an unbelievable rate of growth so thank you so much to everyone
12640	16080	who's joined up with me on this little corner of the internet. These last 3 months have
16080	19780	been a crazy, busy time for me with too many projects going on at once and the next 3 months
19780	23600	will probably be the same with more videos and other stuff on the way. But one project
23600	26720	that's finished now, thanks to Hank Green, a man who himself runs so many different things
26720	30400	it's hard to keep track of them all, is the CGP Grey shirt which is now available on the
30400	34180	DFTBA store. In case you're wondering, the proceeds of the shirt will be used to purchase
34180	38000	coffee. That coffee will fuel the typing and clicking needed to manufacture videos, videos
38000	41380	which may contain links to buy the very shirts that brought them into existence, thus completing
41380	45320	the circle of life. So go grab one today if you'd like to support the channel. It's been
45320	48380	amazing making videos for you and watching the channel grow, though now releasing each
48380	53080	video to so many people is slightly intimidating. Even though I take far, far too long researching
53080	56340	each one, I still spend the first few minutes after uploading Living in Fear that I've made
56340	59820	some unintentional error and waiting for the inevitable comment pointing out where
59820	63380	I've made a typo. And there are always typos.
63380	66680	But terror of errors aside, the nice thing about having such a large community is being
66680	70400	able to share not only my own stuff with you, but also other people's videos, either through
70400	74120	hidden links on my own or in separate playlists like the one I've made this week. Though on
74120	77900	these videos I've noticed people often leave comments like Grey's army coming through and
77900	82260	I'm not sure that an army is the best representation of who we are. I'm more a science and technology
82260	85860	guy who likes reason and simple things that turn complex in interesting ways. And since
85900	88860	you're here watching these videos, I assume you are as well. I'm not sure what the best
88860	92140	collective noun for this growing community is, but if you have any thoughts I'd love
92140	96260	to hear them. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. You are the reason I can continue to make
96260	99340	these videos. Thank you for watching and thank you for subscribing.
