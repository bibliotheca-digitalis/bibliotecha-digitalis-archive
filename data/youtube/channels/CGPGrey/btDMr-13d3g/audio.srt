Hi YouTube. Well, that was fast. At the end of January I made a video thanking the first

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,180
100,000 subscribers for joining my channel and now, just 3 months later, the subscribers

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,640
have been doubled, which is an unbelievable rate of growth so thank you so much to everyone

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,080
who's joined up with me on this little corner of the internet. These last 3 months have

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,780
been a crazy, busy time for me with too many projects going on at once and the next 3 months

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,600
will probably be the same with more videos and other stuff on the way. But one project

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
that's finished now, thanks to Hank Green, a man who himself runs so many different things

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,400
it's hard to keep track of them all, is the CGP Grey shirt which is now available on the

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,180
DFTBA store. In case you're wondering, the proceeds of the shirt will be used to purchase

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,000
coffee. That coffee will fuel the typing and clicking needed to manufacture videos, videos

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,380
which may contain links to buy the very shirts that brought them into existence, thus completing

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,320
the circle of life. So go grab one today if you'd like to support the channel. It's been

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,380
amazing making videos for you and watching the channel grow, though now releasing each

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,080
video to so many people is slightly intimidating. Even though I take far, far too long researching

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,340
each one, I still spend the first few minutes after uploading Living in Fear that I've made

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,820
some unintentional error and waiting for the inevitable comment pointing out where

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,380
I've made a typo. And there are always typos.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,680
But terror of errors aside, the nice thing about having such a large community is being

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,400
able to share not only my own stuff with you, but also other people's videos, either through

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,120
hidden links on my own or in separate playlists like the one I've made this week. Though on

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,900
these videos I've noticed people often leave comments like Grey's army coming through and

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,260
I'm not sure that an army is the best representation of who we are. I'm more a science and technology

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,860
guy who likes reason and simple things that turn complex in interesting ways. And since

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,860
you're here watching these videos, I assume you are as well. I'm not sure what the best

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,140
collective noun for this growing community is, but if you have any thoughts I'd love

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,260
to hear them. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. You are the reason I can continue to make

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,340
these videos. Thank you for watching and thank you for subscribing.
