00:00.000 --> 00:04.980
Back in the 1690s there were only two countries on the island of Great Britain, the Kingdom

00:04.980 --> 00:06.740
of Scotland and the Kingdom of England.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.020
England and the other great European powers were doing rather well for themselves by expanding

00:10.020 --> 00:12.300
their empires through the cunning use of flags.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.180
Scotland had no empire but wanted to join in the game and thus needed to establish a

00:15.180 --> 00:16.700
colony of her very own.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.700
But where to build it?

00:17.700 --> 00:19.500
Panama declared Scotland.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.380
She imagined the colony's strategic location would make trade with the Far East safer and

00:22.380 --> 00:25.980
faster by eliminating the long journey around the hazardous Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn

00:25.980 --> 00:29.720
where both wind and wave delight in smashing ships against the rock and ice.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.520
Who will lend me the money to make this great idea a reality? asked Scotland.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.960
No one was the answer.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.000
Instead of helping, the European empires started trade wars with Scotland to limit the power

00:37.000 --> 00:38.400
of their future rival.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.660
So poor Scotland had to fund the project herself.

00:40.660 --> 00:44.760
She gathered up all the money she could, literally put it all in a big box and, capital thusly

00:44.760 --> 00:46.680
raised, sent off a colonial ship.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.740
400,000 pounds, 8,000 kilometers and 111 days later, 2,500 Scotsmen landed on the shores

00:51.740 --> 00:55.480
of Panama, named it New Caledonia and immediately discovered a few small problems with their

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
plan.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.640
First, the mountains on the western side of Panama were a wee bit larger than expected,

00:59.640 --> 01:01.920
making overland trade pretty much impossible.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.160
Even if they had thought of building a canal, the technology to do so was still 200 years

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
away.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.040
Second, the woolen goods brought to trade with the locals were useless in the endless

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
heat and humidity.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.720
Third, the Spanish cachicodores had already planted flags on the sandy beaches and weren't

01:13.720 --> 01:15.340
too happy to see the Scots arrive.

01:15.340 --> 01:19.040
And fourth, without adequate supplies, diseases such as the perennial tropical favorite dysentery

01:19.040 --> 01:20.240
spread quickly.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.240
Two years and 2,000 dead Scots later, they abandoned the project.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.480
Now this wasn't the first failed attempt at a Scottish empire.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.280
Early colonies had been tried and abandoned in Nova Scotia, New Jersey and Carolina, but

01:29.280 --> 01:33.440
the Panama debacle was particularly devastating to Scotland because she was over-invested.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.640
Remember that money in a box?

01:34.640 --> 01:37.360
Turns out it was a fifth the wealth of the whole country.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
Oops!

01:38.360 --> 01:41.040
Scotland's sudden impoverishment proved a golden opportunity for the Kingdom of England,

01:41.040 --> 01:43.640
who was growing increasingly worried that her neighbor to the north would ally with

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
an enemy.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.940
England offered Scotland a deal that would reimburse Scotland for her losses if she voted

01:47.940 --> 01:48.940
for union.

01:48.940 --> 01:52.480
In 1707 Scotland agreed and the Kingdom of Great Britain was born.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.600
While a surrender of independence was unpopular in Scotland, her economy improved with access

01:55.600 --> 01:58.700
to the once English, now British, trade routes and she played a formative role in what would

01:58.700 --> 02:01.360
soon be the largest empire in human history.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.400
That being said, still more than 300 years later Scotland has never fully given up her

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
national identity and thoughts of independence.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.960
Thanks for watching!
