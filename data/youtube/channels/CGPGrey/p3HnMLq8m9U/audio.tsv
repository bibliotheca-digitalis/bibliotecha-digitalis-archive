0	4980	Back in the 1690s there were only two countries on the island of Great Britain, the Kingdom
4980	6740	of Scotland and the Kingdom of England.
6740	10020	England and the other great European powers were doing rather well for themselves by expanding
10020	12300	their empires through the cunning use of flags.
12300	15180	Scotland had no empire but wanted to join in the game and thus needed to establish a
15180	16700	colony of her very own.
16700	17700	But where to build it?
17700	19500	Panama declared Scotland.
19500	22380	She imagined the colony's strategic location would make trade with the Far East safer and
22380	25980	faster by eliminating the long journey around the hazardous Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn
25980	29720	where both wind and wave delight in smashing ships against the rock and ice.
29720	32520	Who will lend me the money to make this great idea a reality? asked Scotland.
32520	33960	No one was the answer.
33960	37000	Instead of helping, the European empires started trade wars with Scotland to limit the power
37000	38400	of their future rival.
38400	40660	So poor Scotland had to fund the project herself.
40660	44760	She gathered up all the money she could, literally put it all in a big box and, capital thusly
44760	46680	raised, sent off a colonial ship.
46680	51740	400,000 pounds, 8,000 kilometers and 111 days later, 2,500 Scotsmen landed on the shores
51740	55480	of Panama, named it New Caledonia and immediately discovered a few small problems with their
55480	56480	plan.
56480	59640	First, the mountains on the western side of Panama were a wee bit larger than expected,
59640	61920	making overland trade pretty much impossible.
61920	65160	Even if they had thought of building a canal, the technology to do so was still 200 years
65160	66160	away.
66160	69040	Second, the woolen goods brought to trade with the locals were useless in the endless
69040	70040	heat and humidity.
70040	73720	Third, the Spanish cachicodores had already planted flags on the sandy beaches and weren't
73720	75340	too happy to see the Scots arrive.
75340	79040	And fourth, without adequate supplies, diseases such as the perennial tropical favorite dysentery
79040	80240	spread quickly.
80240	83240	Two years and 2,000 dead Scots later, they abandoned the project.
83240	85480	Now this wasn't the first failed attempt at a Scottish empire.
85480	89280	Early colonies had been tried and abandoned in Nova Scotia, New Jersey and Carolina, but
89280	93440	the Panama debacle was particularly devastating to Scotland because she was over-invested.
93440	94640	Remember that money in a box?
94640	97360	Turns out it was a fifth the wealth of the whole country.
97360	98360	Oops!
98360	101040	Scotland's sudden impoverishment proved a golden opportunity for the Kingdom of England,
101040	103640	who was growing increasingly worried that her neighbor to the north would ally with
103640	104640	an enemy.
104640	107940	England offered Scotland a deal that would reimburse Scotland for her losses if she voted
107940	108940	for union.
108940	112480	In 1707 Scotland agreed and the Kingdom of Great Britain was born.
112480	115600	While a surrender of independence was unpopular in Scotland, her economy improved with access
115600	118700	to the once English, now British, trade routes and she played a formative role in what would
118700	121360	soon be the largest empire in human history.
121360	124400	That being said, still more than 300 years later Scotland has never fully given up her
124400	126400	national identity and thoughts of independence.
142480	147960	Thanks for watching!
