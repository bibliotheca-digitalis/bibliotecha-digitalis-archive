1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Back in the 1690s there were only two countries on the island of Great Britain, the Kingdom

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,740
of Scotland and the Kingdom of England.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,020
England and the other great European powers were doing rather well for themselves by expanding

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,300
their empires through the cunning use of flags.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,180
Scotland had no empire but wanted to join in the game and thus needed to establish a

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,700
colony of her very own.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,700
But where to build it?

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,500
Panama declared Scotland.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,380
She imagined the colony's strategic location would make trade with the Far East safer and

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,980
faster by eliminating the long journey around the hazardous Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,720
where both wind and wave delight in smashing ships against the rock and ice.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,520
Who will lend me the money to make this great idea a reality? asked Scotland.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,960
No one was the answer.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,000
Instead of helping, the European empires started trade wars with Scotland to limit the power

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,400
of their future rival.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,660
So poor Scotland had to fund the project herself.

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,760
She gathered up all the money she could, literally put it all in a big box and, capital thusly

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,680
raised, sent off a colonial ship.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,740
400,000 pounds, 8,000 kilometers and 111 days later, 2,500 Scotsmen landed on the shores

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,480
of Panama, named it New Caledonia and immediately discovered a few small problems with their

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
plan.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,640
First, the mountains on the western side of Panama were a wee bit larger than expected,

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,920
making overland trade pretty much impossible.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,160
Even if they had thought of building a canal, the technology to do so was still 200 years

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
away.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,040
Second, the woolen goods brought to trade with the locals were useless in the endless

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
heat and humidity.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,720
Third, the Spanish cachicodores had already planted flags on the sandy beaches and weren't

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,340
too happy to see the Scots arrive.

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,040
And fourth, without adequate supplies, diseases such as the perennial tropical favorite dysentery

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
spread quickly.

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Two years and 2,000 dead Scots later, they abandoned the project.

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,480
Now this wasn't the first failed attempt at a Scottish empire.

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Early colonies had been tried and abandoned in Nova Scotia, New Jersey and Carolina, but

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,440
the Panama debacle was particularly devastating to Scotland because she was over-invested.

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Remember that money in a box?

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,360
Turns out it was a fifth the wealth of the whole country.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Oops!

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,040
Scotland's sudden impoverishment proved a golden opportunity for the Kingdom of England,

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,640
who was growing increasingly worried that her neighbor to the north would ally with

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
an enemy.

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,940
England offered Scotland a deal that would reimburse Scotland for her losses if she voted

43
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
for union.

44
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,480
In 1707 Scotland agreed and the Kingdom of Great Britain was born.

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,600
While a surrender of independence was unpopular in Scotland, her economy improved with access

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,700
to the once English, now British, trade routes and she played a formative role in what would

47
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,360
soon be the largest empire in human history.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,400
That being said, still more than 300 years later Scotland has never fully given up her

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
national identity and thoughts of independence.

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,960
Thanks for watching!
