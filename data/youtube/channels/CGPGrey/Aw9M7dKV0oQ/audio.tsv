0	4640	This is the Don't Die Box.
4640	10160	It was sent to me because after exploring an abandoned nuclear weapons testing facility
10160	17400	and driving on the most deadly road in America, my team and my wife all decided I needed to
17400	21900	bring a Don't Die Box with me on further explorations.
21900	26340	I don't know what's inside, so I thought it might be fun to open on camera and find out
26340	30340	together what's been thrust upon me as new travel gear.
30340	31340	Whoa!
31340	32340	Hello!
32340	33340	Yes!
33340	41140	Inspector Lucy is also here to inspect anything that comes into the house.
41140	47380	All right, tissues, uh, not the most dramatic Don't Die item, but always helpful to have.
47380	50060	Yak track shoe treads?
50060	53820	These are like chains for your shoes, I guess.
53820	54820	Okay.
54820	57500	Oh, I think we'll save this for later.
57500	58500	Put that over here.
58500	63660	All right, I've got a ton of 3M respirator masks.
63660	67300	In modern days, respirator masks definitely don't go unwelcomed.
67300	69460	Oh yeah, what is that?
69460	71820	Just very curious.
71820	73860	What are all these things?
73860	74960	What's going on?
74960	77100	It's very exciting.
77100	79860	It's very exciting, Inspector Lucy.
79860	82060	Okay, back to business.
82060	88500	Definitely definitely last time when I was out at the t-coi test range, gloves were the
88500	92140	thing that killed me.
92140	95220	So many tumbleweed thorns, completely unnecessary.
95220	98600	So a good pair of gloves, fantastic.
98600	99780	First aid kit.
99780	103620	You should always have a first aid kit around, just in case.
103620	104620	Hiking hat.
104620	109420	It doesn't seem like a Don't Die item at first, but it's really Don't Die of skin cancer.
109460	114980	All right, this one is Don't Die of hypothermia, which is surprisingly easy to do.
114980	124660	Okay, and in the bottom of the box, we've got boots, big old hiking boots.
124660	129380	Don't Die from scorpions and other creepy crawlers.
129380	132580	And we've got the socks to go along with the boots.
132580	135660	The Don't Die box is actually two boxes.
135660	139700	This is the big and light one.
139700	143600	There's a significantly heavier one that comes with a companion package.
143600	149100	So let's see what's in that.
149100	150100	Good poppery.
150100	152380	Oh, it's getting in your hair.
152380	155420	I'm so sorry.
155420	156700	There's so much in here.
156700	158220	Oh my goodness.
158220	159220	Okay.
159220	160740	Stain-a-live bandana.
160740	161740	Two bandanas.
161780	166020	And now I can choose if I'm being a bandito if I want to go with dark or light mode.
166020	167020	Hand warmers.
167020	170660	More Don't Die of hypothermia if you don't need to devices.
170660	171980	Yeah, what's that?
171980	173260	Emergency burn gel.
173260	177220	I guess I didn't really think about it, but yes, if you burn yourself and you're in the
177220	179780	middle of nowhere, that's going to be real bad.
179780	180780	Ah, okay.
180780	182020	All right.
182020	183020	This is very important.
183020	184180	Lucy, do you see this one?
184180	188060	No, this one Inspector Lucy is not interested in, but I am very interested in.
188060	190100	An air quality detector.
190100	192580	So this is something where I lucked out.
192580	198060	I only learned about this after I was exploring confined spaces, but I really should have
198060	199700	known about it beforehand.
199700	206620	It is very easy for unbreathable gases to collect in confined spaces.
206620	211820	You can pass out very quickly and then you will asphyxiate to death.
211820	215660	So if you have to be in an area where there's going to be a confined space and air that
215660	220620	hasn't moved around, you have to bring with you an air quality detector.
220620	226860	Otherwise I would describe that kind of exploration as suicidally stupid, which I did by accident
226860	227860	previously.
227860	230220	All right, what's this?
230220	231220	I've got a hammock.
231220	236700	Okay, I've got to say this one doesn't exactly strike me as a don't die as part of the don't
236700	237860	die box.
237860	242260	This is more like don't be uncomfortable, but still I will take it.
242260	243260	Here we go.
243340	247860	You know what the most important thing to have in a dangerous situation?
247860	248860	Knowledge.
248860	249860	That's what you need.
249860	253820	Boom, boom, two giant tomes of knowledge.
253820	259180	Although I hope I can read very quickly for whatever the problem is.
259180	260380	Radiation detector.
260380	265380	Something I definitely would have wanted to have on the nuclear test facility.
265380	271260	And secondly, these are these emergency beacons, which are a thing that I didn't even know
271260	272260	existed.
272260	279340	I can send out a one time alarm to rescue services that says, this is your current location.
279340	281700	I need help right now.
281700	284500	So this is a like, press it, please help me.
284500	286100	I'm in a dire situation.
286100	287420	This is where I am.
287420	291660	GPS emergency beacon, great.
291660	295440	Something in particular I hope I won't have to use, venom extractor.
295440	300140	But you know what, I'd rather have to use the venom extractor than have to say, lose
300140	302780	a leg or my life.
302780	306460	Insect repellent, because we wish to repel them at every moment we can.
306460	310180	Mace, because you know what the most dangerous animal out there is?
310180	311180	Man.
311180	317420	Oh, fantastic, a Leatherman, because you need a multi-tool.
317420	319420	For sure.
319420	321140	Nice.
321140	324300	Even comes with this handy-dandy pouch.
324300	325940	Cool.
325940	327540	Flashlight and a headlamp.
327540	329800	Oh, it's so tiny.
329800	332000	But boy is it bright.
332000	333000	Adorable.
333000	336200	A little clip so you can just put it on your jeans.
336200	337200	Got it.
337200	341240	Sorry, Lucy, I didn't mean to almost drop that on you.
341240	343200	Batteries, batteries, batteries, matches.
343200	351560	Matches, I'll need the Boy Scout manual to tell me how to actually start a proper fire.
351560	356560	And of course, because you don't want to be uncomfortable when you're stranded out in
356560	357560	nature.
357560	359600	And lastly, let's take a look.
359600	361800	What was in these boxes?
361800	366360	Yeah, what is it?
366360	367880	So this is very sweet.
367880	372600	Part of my team who put this together for me is from Alabama, so that's very nice.
372600	377520	I think this is partly to exist at my parents' house where I currently am, which is to remind
377520	379720	my parents who's helping keep me alive.
379720	383480	There's actually one thing that I haven't mentioned, which also came along with all
383480	392040	of this, which is an instruction manual for everything.
392040	395440	This is the CGP Grey Urbex Backpack Essentials.
395440	397880	That little drawing is adorable.
397880	403880	This is instructions on what everything in the box is exactly to be used for in case
403880	405720	I can't figure it out myself.
405720	408800	So I have a lot of reading to do.
408800	416560	Okay, well, that is everything in the Don't Die box.
416560	417680	Thank you for watching.
417680	420280	Thank you to Inspector Lucy for helping out.
420280	424040	Thanks to my mom for letting me record in her closet.
424040	429320	And now I have to clean up the enormous mess that I have made, pack it all back into the
429320	433840	box, put it in the car so that I always have it with me on future adventures.
433840	436480	All right, I'm going to do that now.
436480	437480	Bye everyone!
437480	438480	What a good girl!
438480	438480
