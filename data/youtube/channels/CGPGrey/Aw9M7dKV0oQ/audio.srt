1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
This is the Don't Die Box.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,160
It was sent to me because after exploring an abandoned nuclear weapons testing facility

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,400
and driving on the most deadly road in America, my team and my wife all decided I needed to

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,900
bring a Don't Die Box with me on further explorations.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,340
I don't know what's inside, so I thought it might be fun to open on camera and find out

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,340
together what's been thrust upon me as new travel gear.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,340
Whoa!

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,340
Hello!

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,340
Yes!

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:41,140
Inspector Lucy is also here to inspect anything that comes into the house.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,380
All right, tissues, uh, not the most dramatic Don't Die item, but always helpful to have.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,060
Yak track shoe treads?

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,820
These are like chains for your shoes, I guess.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Okay.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,500
Oh, I think we'll save this for later.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Put that over here.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,660
All right, I've got a ton of 3M respirator masks.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,300
In modern days, respirator masks definitely don't go unwelcomed.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,460
Oh yeah, what is that?

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,820
Just very curious.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,860
What are all these things?

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,960
What's going on?

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,100
It's very exciting.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,860
It's very exciting, Inspector Lucy.

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,060
Okay, back to business.

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,500
Definitely definitely last time when I was out at the t-coi test range, gloves were the

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,140
thing that killed me.

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,220
So many tumbleweed thorns, completely unnecessary.

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,600
So a good pair of gloves, fantastic.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,780
First aid kit.

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,620
You should always have a first aid kit around, just in case.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,620
Hiking hat.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,420
It doesn't seem like a Don't Die item at first, but it's really Don't Die of skin cancer.

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,980
All right, this one is Don't Die of hypothermia, which is surprisingly easy to do.

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:04,660
Okay, and in the bottom of the box, we've got boots, big old hiking boots.

36
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,380
Don't Die from scorpions and other creepy crawlers.

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,580
And we've got the socks to go along with the boots.

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,660
The Don't Die box is actually two boxes.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,700
This is the big and light one.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,600
There's a significantly heavier one that comes with a companion package.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,100
So let's see what's in that.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
Good poppery.

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,380
Oh, it's getting in your hair.

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,420
I'm so sorry.

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,700
There's so much in here.

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,220
Oh my goodness.

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,220
Okay.

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,740
Stain-a-live bandana.

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
Two bandanas.

50
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,020
And now I can choose if I'm being a bandito if I want to go with dark or light mode.

51
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
Hand warmers.

52
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,660
More Don't Die of hypothermia if you don't need to devices.

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
Yeah, what's that?

54
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,260
Emergency burn gel.

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,220
I guess I didn't really think about it, but yes, if you burn yourself and you're in the

56
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,780
middle of nowhere, that's going to be real bad.

57
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,780
Ah, okay.

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,020
All right.

59
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,020
This is very important.

60
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,180
Lucy, do you see this one?

61
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,060
No, this one Inspector Lucy is not interested in, but I am very interested in.

62
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,100
An air quality detector.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,580
So this is something where I lucked out.

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,060
I only learned about this after I was exploring confined spaces, but I really should have

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,700
known about it beforehand.

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,620
It is very easy for unbreathable gases to collect in confined spaces.

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,820
You can pass out very quickly and then you will asphyxiate to death.

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,660
So if you have to be in an area where there's going to be a confined space and air that

69
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,620
hasn't moved around, you have to bring with you an air quality detector.

70
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,860
Otherwise I would describe that kind of exploration as suicidally stupid, which I did by accident

71
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,860
previously.

72
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,220
All right, what's this?

73
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,220
I've got a hammock.

74
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,700
Okay, I've got to say this one doesn't exactly strike me as a don't die as part of the don't

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,860
die box.

76
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,260
This is more like don't be uncomfortable, but still I will take it.

77
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Here we go.

78
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,860
You know what the most important thing to have in a dangerous situation?

79
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
Knowledge.

80
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
That's what you need.

81
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,820
Boom, boom, two giant tomes of knowledge.

82
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,180
Although I hope I can read very quickly for whatever the problem is.

83
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,380
Radiation detector.

84
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,380
Something I definitely would have wanted to have on the nuclear test facility.

85
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,260
And secondly, these are these emergency beacons, which are a thing that I didn't even know

86
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
existed.

87
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,340
I can send out a one time alarm to rescue services that says, this is your current location.

88
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,700
I need help right now.

89
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,500
So this is a like, press it, please help me.

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm in a dire situation.

91
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,420
This is where I am.

92
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,660
GPS emergency beacon, great.

93
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,440
Something in particular I hope I won't have to use, venom extractor.

94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,140
But you know what, I'd rather have to use the venom extractor than have to say, lose

95
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,780
a leg or my life.

96
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,460
Insect repellent, because we wish to repel them at every moment we can.

97
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,180
Mace, because you know what the most dangerous animal out there is?

98
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,180
Man.

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,420
Oh, fantastic, a Leatherman, because you need a multi-tool.

100
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,420
For sure.

101
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,140
Nice.

102
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,300
Even comes with this handy-dandy pouch.

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,940
Cool.

104
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,540
Flashlight and a headlamp.

105
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,800
Oh, it's so tiny.

106
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
But boy is it bright.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Adorable.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,200
A little clip so you can just put it on your jeans.

109
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Got it.

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Sorry, Lucy, I didn't mean to almost drop that on you.

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Batteries, batteries, batteries, matches.

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:51,560
Matches, I'll need the Boy Scout manual to tell me how to actually start a proper fire.

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,560
And of course, because you don't want to be uncomfortable when you're stranded out in

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
nature.

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,600
And lastly, let's take a look.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
What was in these boxes?

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah, what is it?

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,880
So this is very sweet.

119
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,600
Part of my team who put this together for me is from Alabama, so that's very nice.

120
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,520
I think this is partly to exist at my parents' house where I currently am, which is to remind

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,720
my parents who's helping keep me alive.

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,480
There's actually one thing that I haven't mentioned, which also came along with all

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:32,040
of this, which is an instruction manual for everything.

124
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,440
This is the CGP Grey Urbex Backpack Essentials.

125
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,880
That little drawing is adorable.

126
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,880
This is instructions on what everything in the box is exactly to be used for in case

127
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,720
I can't figure it out myself.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,800
So I have a lot of reading to do.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay, well, that is everything in the Don't Die box.

130
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Thank you for watching.

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,280
Thank you to Inspector Lucy for helping out.

132
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,040
Thanks to my mom for letting me record in her closet.

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,320
And now I have to clean up the enormous mess that I have made, pack it all back into the

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,840
box, put it in the car so that I always have it with me on future adventures.

135
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
All right, I'm going to do that now.

136
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Bye everyone!

137
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
What a good girl!

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,480
