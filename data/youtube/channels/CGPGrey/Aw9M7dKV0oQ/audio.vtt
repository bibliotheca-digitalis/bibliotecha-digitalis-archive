WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
This is the Don't Die Box.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.160
It was sent to me because after exploring an abandoned nuclear weapons testing facility

00:10.160 --> 00:17.400
and driving on the most deadly road in America, my team and my wife all decided I needed to

00:17.400 --> 00:21.900
bring a Don't Die Box with me on further explorations.

00:21.900 --> 00:26.340
I don't know what's inside, so I thought it might be fun to open on camera and find out

00:26.340 --> 00:30.340
together what's been thrust upon me as new travel gear.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.340
Whoa!

00:31.340 --> 00:32.340
Hello!

00:32.340 --> 00:33.340
Yes!

00:33.340 --> 00:41.140
Inspector Lucy is also here to inspect anything that comes into the house.

00:41.140 --> 00:47.380
All right, tissues, uh, not the most dramatic Don't Die item, but always helpful to have.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.060
Yak track shoe treads?

00:50.060 --> 00:53.820
These are like chains for your shoes, I guess.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.820
Okay.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.500
Oh, I think we'll save this for later.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.500
Put that over here.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.660
All right, I've got a ton of 3M respirator masks.

01:03.660 --> 01:07.300
In modern days, respirator masks definitely don't go unwelcomed.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.460
Oh yeah, what is that?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.820
Just very curious.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.860
What are all these things?

01:13.860 --> 01:14.960
What's going on?

01:14.960 --> 01:17.100
It's very exciting.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.860
It's very exciting, Inspector Lucy.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.060
Okay, back to business.

01:22.060 --> 01:28.500
Definitely definitely last time when I was out at the t-coi test range, gloves were the

01:28.500 --> 01:32.140
thing that killed me.

01:32.140 --> 01:35.220
So many tumbleweed thorns, completely unnecessary.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.600
So a good pair of gloves, fantastic.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.780
First aid kit.

01:39.780 --> 01:43.620
You should always have a first aid kit around, just in case.

01:43.620 --> 01:44.620
Hiking hat.

01:44.620 --> 01:49.420
It doesn't seem like a Don't Die item at first, but it's really Don't Die of skin cancer.

01:49.460 --> 01:54.980
All right, this one is Don't Die of hypothermia, which is surprisingly easy to do.

01:54.980 --> 02:04.660
Okay, and in the bottom of the box, we've got boots, big old hiking boots.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.380
Don't Die from scorpions and other creepy crawlers.

02:09.380 --> 02:12.580
And we've got the socks to go along with the boots.

02:12.580 --> 02:15.660
The Don't Die box is actually two boxes.

02:15.660 --> 02:19.700
This is the big and light one.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.600
There's a significantly heavier one that comes with a companion package.

02:23.600 --> 02:29.100
So let's see what's in that.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.100
Good poppery.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.380
Oh, it's getting in your hair.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.420
I'm so sorry.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.700
There's so much in here.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.220
Oh my goodness.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.220
Okay.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.740
Stain-a-live bandana.

02:40.740 --> 02:41.740
Two bandanas.

02:41.780 --> 02:46.020
And now I can choose if I'm being a bandito if I want to go with dark or light mode.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.020
Hand warmers.

02:47.020 --> 02:50.660
More Don't Die of hypothermia if you don't need to devices.

02:50.660 --> 02:51.980
Yeah, what's that?

02:51.980 --> 02:53.260
Emergency burn gel.

02:53.260 --> 02:57.220
I guess I didn't really think about it, but yes, if you burn yourself and you're in the

02:57.220 --> 02:59.780
middle of nowhere, that's going to be real bad.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.780
Ah, okay.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.020
All right.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.020
This is very important.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.180
Lucy, do you see this one?

03:04.180 --> 03:08.060
No, this one Inspector Lucy is not interested in, but I am very interested in.

03:08.060 --> 03:10.100
An air quality detector.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.580
So this is something where I lucked out.

03:12.580 --> 03:18.060
I only learned about this after I was exploring confined spaces, but I really should have

03:18.060 --> 03:19.700
known about it beforehand.

03:19.700 --> 03:26.620
It is very easy for unbreathable gases to collect in confined spaces.

03:26.620 --> 03:31.820
You can pass out very quickly and then you will asphyxiate to death.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.660
So if you have to be in an area where there's going to be a confined space and air that

03:35.660 --> 03:40.620
hasn't moved around, you have to bring with you an air quality detector.

03:40.620 --> 03:46.860
Otherwise I would describe that kind of exploration as suicidally stupid, which I did by accident

03:46.860 --> 03:47.860
previously.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.220
All right, what's this?

03:50.220 --> 03:51.220
I've got a hammock.

03:51.220 --> 03:56.700
Okay, I've got to say this one doesn't exactly strike me as a don't die as part of the don't

03:56.700 --> 03:57.860
die box.

03:57.860 --> 04:02.260
This is more like don't be uncomfortable, but still I will take it.

04:02.260 --> 04:03.260
Here we go.

04:03.340 --> 04:07.860
You know what the most important thing to have in a dangerous situation?

04:07.860 --> 04:08.860
Knowledge.

04:08.860 --> 04:09.860
That's what you need.

04:09.860 --> 04:13.820
Boom, boom, two giant tomes of knowledge.

04:13.820 --> 04:19.180
Although I hope I can read very quickly for whatever the problem is.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.380
Radiation detector.

04:20.380 --> 04:25.380
Something I definitely would have wanted to have on the nuclear test facility.

04:25.380 --> 04:31.260
And secondly, these are these emergency beacons, which are a thing that I didn't even know

04:31.260 --> 04:32.260
existed.

04:32.260 --> 04:39.340
I can send out a one time alarm to rescue services that says, this is your current location.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.700
I need help right now.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.500
So this is a like, press it, please help me.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.100
I'm in a dire situation.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.420
This is where I am.

04:47.420 --> 04:51.660
GPS emergency beacon, great.

04:51.660 --> 04:55.440
Something in particular I hope I won't have to use, venom extractor.

04:55.440 --> 05:00.140
But you know what, I'd rather have to use the venom extractor than have to say, lose

05:00.140 --> 05:02.780
a leg or my life.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.460
Insect repellent, because we wish to repel them at every moment we can.

05:06.460 --> 05:10.180
Mace, because you know what the most dangerous animal out there is?

05:10.180 --> 05:11.180
Man.

05:11.180 --> 05:17.420
Oh, fantastic, a Leatherman, because you need a multi-tool.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.420
For sure.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.140
Nice.

05:21.140 --> 05:24.300
Even comes with this handy-dandy pouch.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.940
Cool.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.540
Flashlight and a headlamp.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.800
Oh, it's so tiny.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.000
But boy is it bright.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Adorable.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.200
A little clip so you can just put it on your jeans.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
Got it.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.240
Sorry, Lucy, I didn't mean to almost drop that on you.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.200
Batteries, batteries, batteries, matches.

05:43.200 --> 05:51.560
Matches, I'll need the Boy Scout manual to tell me how to actually start a proper fire.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.560
And of course, because you don't want to be uncomfortable when you're stranded out in

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
nature.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.600
And lastly, let's take a look.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.800
What was in these boxes?

06:01.800 --> 06:06.360
Yeah, what is it?

06:06.360 --> 06:07.880
So this is very sweet.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.600
Part of my team who put this together for me is from Alabama, so that's very nice.

06:12.600 --> 06:17.520
I think this is partly to exist at my parents' house where I currently am, which is to remind

06:17.520 --> 06:19.720
my parents who's helping keep me alive.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.480
There's actually one thing that I haven't mentioned, which also came along with all

06:23.480 --> 06:32.040
of this, which is an instruction manual for everything.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.440
This is the CGP Grey Urbex Backpack Essentials.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.880
That little drawing is adorable.

06:37.880 --> 06:43.880
This is instructions on what everything in the box is exactly to be used for in case

06:43.880 --> 06:45.720
I can't figure it out myself.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.800
So I have a lot of reading to do.

06:48.800 --> 06:56.560
Okay, well, that is everything in the Don't Die box.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.680
Thank you for watching.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.280
Thank you to Inspector Lucy for helping out.

07:00.280 --> 07:04.040
Thanks to my mom for letting me record in her closet.

07:04.040 --> 07:09.320
And now I have to clean up the enormous mess that I have made, pack it all back into the

07:09.320 --> 07:13.840
box, put it in the car so that I always have it with me on future adventures.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.480
All right, I'm going to do that now.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.480
Bye everyone!

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
What a good girl!

07:18.480 --> 07:18.480
