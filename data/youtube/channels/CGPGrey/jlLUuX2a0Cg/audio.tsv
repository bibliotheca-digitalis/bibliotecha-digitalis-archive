0	3800	Hello Internet, when's the next Q&A with Grey? Right now.
3800	6600	What opinion have you held for a time and then changed radically?
6600	9200	Well, as mentioned the first time I talked about changing your mind,
9200	14100	this is always hard to discuss because the specifics are often quite personal,
14100	18100	but the biggest non-personal thing I've changed my opinion on is breakfast.
18100	21200	I used to believe breakfast was absolutely vital, not just believe it,
21200	26700	I had evidence that skipping, nay even delaying breakfast ruined everything.
26700	29900	But as I've tried to get healthier, slowly and inconsistently,
29900	33700	I've experimented with various things and the one that shocked me the most is
33700	35000	breakfast is bullshit.
35000	39700	After an admittedly rough adjustment period, my body no longer needed breakfast
39700	45700	and it's hard to describe just how much of a huge quality of life improvement this has been,
45700	49900	simplifying my normal morning routine and making early travel days easier.
49900	53000	While I'll still eat breakfast sometimes, particularly on vacations,
53000	55700	because it's clearly the best of the three, seven meals,
55700	58700	it's no longer the necessary part of life I thought it was.
58700	61500	What do you want people to remember you for 500 years from now?
61500	64900	I don't want to be remembered, I want to be alive.
64900	66700	What is the most frivolous item you own?
66700	71300	Man, that is a good question that had me looking up exactly what frivolous means,
71300	73200	not having purpose or value.
73200	76100	So a thing I own which has neither purpose nor value,
76100	80200	I'm not really sure anything I own fits that description, but I'll keep looking for you.
80200	84400	If you have an idea in the shower without phone or notebook present, what do you do?
85600	86600	Hey Siri!
86600	92600	Make a note, must not forget, million, nay, billion dollar idea.
92600	96100	Nice weather coming up for paradise in the United States.
96100	97600	What do you think of jazz?
97600	100400	Jazz is the opposite of everything I like in music.
100400	104600	I want music to have patterns and repetition, patterns and repetition.
104600	107100	This is why I also don't like live music.
107100	112600	I view music as a brain manipulation tool and to that end jazz is anti-useful to me.
112600	114100	Do you still love music?
114100	116100	Jazz is anti-useful to me.
124400	127200	If you had control of a super intelligence to which you could only give one command
127200	129600	and it would execute it to the best approximation of what you intended,
129600	130900	what would your one command be?
130900	132400	Minmax happiness and suffering.
132400	133000	Oh wait!
133000	136700	What's one thing that you're not satisfied with your life right now and how do you plan to solve it?
136700	139000	I've gotten into time tracking pretty deeply.
139000	145000	I used to just track my work hours, but I began to record how every hour of every day is spent.
145000	148600	And let me tell you, no matter how well you think you spend your time
148600	151000	and no matter how well you do spend your time,
151000	158000	tracking all your time is an unflinching look into a mirror eternally uncomfortable.
158000	162200	So I'm not thrilled with the way my pie chart for last year looks.
162200	167900	It was a year of chaos, but it's not possible to improve without knowing where you're starting.
167900	173300	And one of the ways I'm working to make this better is simply to have the data about how I spend my time
173300	175300	more visible in more places.
175300	178300	I've just begun in the most baby steps way possible,
178300	182500	but so far, making life more visible seems like a good feedback loop.
182500	183300	How are you doing?
183300	184300	Good thanks.
185100	185800	You?
185800	190200	If you had to enroll at a university tomorrow and had to choose one field of study, which would you choose?
190200	195200	I'd like to say I'd take a programming course, but I'm pretty sure I couldn't pass at the university level.
195200	201100	Constants and functions and loops, oh my, are fun and clear, but once it gets to pointers, it's a level too far.
201100	204300	So if I needed to pass, I'd probably sign up for economics.
204300	207500	I dropped out of that master's course, as mentioned in a previous Q&A,
207500	211900	because it wasn't the right fit in my life at that time, but I'd be happy to give it a go again.
211900	216700	Of all the classes you've ever taken at uni, what was your hardest, what did you hate the most, why?
216700	219900	Well, the physics classes in my later years were the hardest,
219900	224600	and were probably the hardest intellectual thing I've ever done or will do.
224600	226300	But that's the boring-er question.
226300	229400	The more interesting question is which class I hated the most.
229400	232000	That was a required humanities reading class.
232000	237300	It was one of those classes where the professor had free reign to just select a bunch of books they liked,
237300	241200	and force students to read them and write essays agreeing with the professor,
241200	244400	or disagreeing in a way the professor agreed with.
244400	245600	God, did I hate it.
245600	250400	I really think it's the kind of class that professors make mandatory because they like to teach it,
250400	256000	and it makes them look smart, and it's easy, and not because it's remotely good for the students involved.
256000	260900	Anyway, it had to be done, and I had a pretty good idea in advance, I would hate it.
260900	267800	So at my college, there was an option to compress an entire academic year of these classes into one intense summer.
267800	274400	So I stayed at college over what was vacation for most people to finish this class as fast as possible.
274400	279800	I've always been pretty good at reading a lot using an on-off schedule when I need to, and it served me well here.
279800	285700	I think I read something like 30 stupid or boring or flowery or pompous books over that summer.
285700	289500	Anyway, it worked so well it was a strategy I used every summer,
289500	294000	compressing as many dumb mandatory classes into as short a time as possible.
294000	301800	If your school gives that as an option, I highly recommend it so you have more time during the rest of the year to focus on more important things.
301800	304300	Raisins and chocolate chip cookies? Gross.
304300	306500	What noise do you wake up to? None.
306500	311500	I used to use music to wake up to because this is the world's most unpleasant sound,
311500	315600	but doing so trains yourself to dislike whatever song you use
315600	320600	and have it randomly cause you a sense of drowning anxiety when you hear it in a different context.
320600	324100	I used to use a Sigur Ros song during my teaching years to wake me up,
324100	330100	and I still can't hear the opening few seconds without feeling like I'm drowning a decade later.
330100	335300	Of course, the sound may be none, but I currently use my Apple Watch to wake me up with a vibration,
335300	339100	and I know I'm in a good routine when I wake up naturally before it goes off.
339100	342300	If you could have one superpower, excluding the power to have all powers,
342300	345500	what would it be? Invulnerability with an exit option.
345500	347700	Can you wear silly ties for the rest of the video?
347700	352700	No, I spent years plotting and scheming how to escape the world of ties.
352700	354100	I will not go back to it now.
354100	358400	You are given the opportunity to permanently and irreversibly change one fundamental law of physics.
358400	360000	What would it be and why?
360000	364500	On the panel of fundamental laws and constants, I drape a very big DO NOT TOUCH sign.
364500	366700	How do I get over a crippling Factorio addiction?
366700	370300	You tell me, man. I'm over a thousand hours deep.
370300	373100	Do you feel that humans need not apply needs updating?
373100	376300	Has anything changed since its creation that would change your message?
376300	378800	Not really anything I would change.
378800	385300	I do enjoy that the debate around autos has switched from they'll never happen to why aren't they here now?
385300	387500	Which is an interesting question.
387500	392000	At least in this moment, it feels like progress in self-driving cars is a bit of an S-curve.
392000	396700	So maybe I was over-optimistic about the rapid approach of commercially available autos,
396700	403400	but I still think they're coming and if I can't buy or rent an auto within 10 years of the publication of that video,
403400	406300	I'll be surprised and disappointed.
406300	408100	What is love?
408100	409600	What is love?
409600	411400	Baby, don't hurt me.
411400	412800	Don't hurt me.
412800	414300	No more.
