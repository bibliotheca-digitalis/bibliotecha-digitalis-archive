00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Hello Internet, when's the next Q&A with Grey? Right now.

00:03.800 --> 00:06.600
What opinion have you held for a time and then changed radically?

00:06.600 --> 00:09.200
Well, as mentioned the first time I talked about changing your mind,

00:09.200 --> 00:14.100
this is always hard to discuss because the specifics are often quite personal,

00:14.100 --> 00:18.100
but the biggest non-personal thing I've changed my opinion on is breakfast.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.200
I used to believe breakfast was absolutely vital, not just believe it,

00:21.200 --> 00:26.700
I had evidence that skipping, nay even delaying breakfast ruined everything.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.900
But as I've tried to get healthier, slowly and inconsistently,

00:29.900 --> 00:33.700
I've experimented with various things and the one that shocked me the most is

00:33.700 --> 00:35.000
breakfast is bullshit.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.700
After an admittedly rough adjustment period, my body no longer needed breakfast

00:39.700 --> 00:45.700
and it's hard to describe just how much of a huge quality of life improvement this has been,

00:45.700 --> 00:49.900
simplifying my normal morning routine and making early travel days easier.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.000
While I'll still eat breakfast sometimes, particularly on vacations,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.700
because it's clearly the best of the three, seven meals,

00:55.700 --> 00:58.700
it's no longer the necessary part of life I thought it was.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.500
What do you want people to remember you for 500 years from now?

01:01.500 --> 01:04.900
I don't want to be remembered, I want to be alive.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.700
What is the most frivolous item you own?

01:06.700 --> 01:11.300
Man, that is a good question that had me looking up exactly what frivolous means,

01:11.300 --> 01:13.200
not having purpose or value.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.100
So a thing I own which has neither purpose nor value,

01:16.100 --> 01:20.200
I'm not really sure anything I own fits that description, but I'll keep looking for you.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.400
If you have an idea in the shower without phone or notebook present, what do you do?

01:25.600 --> 01:26.600
Hey Siri!

01:26.600 --> 01:32.600
Make a note, must not forget, million, nay, billion dollar idea.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.100
Nice weather coming up for paradise in the United States.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.600
What do you think of jazz?

01:37.600 --> 01:40.400
Jazz is the opposite of everything I like in music.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.600
I want music to have patterns and repetition, patterns and repetition.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.100
This is why I also don't like live music.

01:47.100 --> 01:52.600
I view music as a brain manipulation tool and to that end jazz is anti-useful to me.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.100
Do you still love music?

01:54.100 --> 01:56.100
Jazz is anti-useful to me.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.200
If you had control of a super intelligence to which you could only give one command

02:07.200 --> 02:09.600
and it would execute it to the best approximation of what you intended,

02:09.600 --> 02:10.900
what would your one command be?

02:10.900 --> 02:12.400
Minmax happiness and suffering.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.000
Oh wait!

02:13.000 --> 02:16.700
What's one thing that you're not satisfied with your life right now and how do you plan to solve it?

02:16.700 --> 02:19.000
I've gotten into time tracking pretty deeply.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
I used to just track my work hours, but I began to record how every hour of every day is spent.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.600
And let me tell you, no matter how well you think you spend your time

02:28.600 --> 02:31.000
and no matter how well you do spend your time,

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
tracking all your time is an unflinching look into a mirror eternally uncomfortable.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.200
So I'm not thrilled with the way my pie chart for last year looks.

02:42.200 --> 02:47.900
It was a year of chaos, but it's not possible to improve without knowing where you're starting.

02:47.900 --> 02:53.300
And one of the ways I'm working to make this better is simply to have the data about how I spend my time

02:53.300 --> 02:55.300
more visible in more places.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.300
I've just begun in the most baby steps way possible,

02:58.300 --> 03:02.500
but so far, making life more visible seems like a good feedback loop.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.300
How are you doing?

03:03.300 --> 03:04.300
Good thanks.

03:05.100 --> 03:05.800
You?

03:05.800 --> 03:10.200
If you had to enroll at a university tomorrow and had to choose one field of study, which would you choose?

03:10.200 --> 03:15.200
I'd like to say I'd take a programming course, but I'm pretty sure I couldn't pass at the university level.

03:15.200 --> 03:21.100
Constants and functions and loops, oh my, are fun and clear, but once it gets to pointers, it's a level too far.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.300
So if I needed to pass, I'd probably sign up for economics.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.500
I dropped out of that master's course, as mentioned in a previous Q&A,

03:27.500 --> 03:31.900
because it wasn't the right fit in my life at that time, but I'd be happy to give it a go again.

03:31.900 --> 03:36.700
Of all the classes you've ever taken at uni, what was your hardest, what did you hate the most, why?

03:36.700 --> 03:39.900
Well, the physics classes in my later years were the hardest,

03:39.900 --> 03:44.600
and were probably the hardest intellectual thing I've ever done or will do.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.300
But that's the boring-er question.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.400
The more interesting question is which class I hated the most.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.000
That was a required humanities reading class.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.300
It was one of those classes where the professor had free reign to just select a bunch of books they liked,

03:57.300 --> 04:01.200
and force students to read them and write essays agreeing with the professor,

04:01.200 --> 04:04.400
or disagreeing in a way the professor agreed with.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.600
God, did I hate it.

04:05.600 --> 04:10.400
I really think it's the kind of class that professors make mandatory because they like to teach it,

04:10.400 --> 04:16.000
and it makes them look smart, and it's easy, and not because it's remotely good for the students involved.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.900
Anyway, it had to be done, and I had a pretty good idea in advance, I would hate it.

04:20.900 --> 04:27.800
So at my college, there was an option to compress an entire academic year of these classes into one intense summer.

04:27.800 --> 04:34.400
So I stayed at college over what was vacation for most people to finish this class as fast as possible.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.800
I've always been pretty good at reading a lot using an on-off schedule when I need to, and it served me well here.

04:39.800 --> 04:45.700
I think I read something like 30 stupid or boring or flowery or pompous books over that summer.

04:45.700 --> 04:49.500
Anyway, it worked so well it was a strategy I used every summer,

04:49.500 --> 04:54.000
compressing as many dumb mandatory classes into as short a time as possible.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.800
If your school gives that as an option, I highly recommend it so you have more time during the rest of the year to focus on more important things.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.300
Raisins and chocolate chip cookies? Gross.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.500
What noise do you wake up to? None.

05:06.500 --> 05:11.500
I used to use music to wake up to because this is the world's most unpleasant sound,

05:11.500 --> 05:15.600
but doing so trains yourself to dislike whatever song you use

05:15.600 --> 05:20.600
and have it randomly cause you a sense of drowning anxiety when you hear it in a different context.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.100
I used to use a Sigur Ros song during my teaching years to wake me up,

05:24.100 --> 05:30.100
and I still can't hear the opening few seconds without feeling like I'm drowning a decade later.

05:30.100 --> 05:35.300
Of course, the sound may be none, but I currently use my Apple Watch to wake me up with a vibration,

05:35.300 --> 05:39.100
and I know I'm in a good routine when I wake up naturally before it goes off.

05:39.100 --> 05:42.300
If you could have one superpower, excluding the power to have all powers,

05:42.300 --> 05:45.500
what would it be? Invulnerability with an exit option.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.700
Can you wear silly ties for the rest of the video?

05:47.700 --> 05:52.700
No, I spent years plotting and scheming how to escape the world of ties.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.100
I will not go back to it now.

05:54.100 --> 05:58.400
You are given the opportunity to permanently and irreversibly change one fundamental law of physics.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.000
What would it be and why?

06:00.000 --> 06:04.500
On the panel of fundamental laws and constants, I drape a very big DO NOT TOUCH sign.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.700
How do I get over a crippling Factorio addiction?

06:06.700 --> 06:10.300
You tell me, man. I'm over a thousand hours deep.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.100
Do you feel that humans need not apply needs updating?

06:13.100 --> 06:16.300
Has anything changed since its creation that would change your message?

06:16.300 --> 06:18.800
Not really anything I would change.

06:18.800 --> 06:25.300
I do enjoy that the debate around autos has switched from they'll never happen to why aren't they here now?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.500
Which is an interesting question.

06:27.500 --> 06:32.000
At least in this moment, it feels like progress in self-driving cars is a bit of an S-curve.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.700
So maybe I was over-optimistic about the rapid approach of commercially available autos,

06:36.700 --> 06:43.400
but I still think they're coming and if I can't buy or rent an auto within 10 years of the publication of that video,

06:43.400 --> 06:46.300
I'll be surprised and disappointed.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.100
What is love?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.600
What is love?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.400
Baby, don't hurt me.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.800
Don't hurt me.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.300
No more.
