00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello Internet, when's the next Q&A with Grey? Right now.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,600
What opinion have you held for a time and then changed radically?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
Well, as mentioned the first time I talked about changing your mind,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,100
this is always hard to discuss because the specifics are often quite personal,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,100
but the biggest non-personal thing I've changed my opinion on is breakfast.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,200
I used to believe breakfast was absolutely vital, not just believe it,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,700
I had evidence that skipping, nay even delaying breakfast ruined everything.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,900
But as I've tried to get healthier, slowly and inconsistently,

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,700
I've experimented with various things and the one that shocked me the most is

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,000
breakfast is bullshit.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,700
After an admittedly rough adjustment period, my body no longer needed breakfast

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,700
and it's hard to describe just how much of a huge quality of life improvement this has been,

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,900
simplifying my normal morning routine and making early travel days easier.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,000
While I'll still eat breakfast sometimes, particularly on vacations,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,700
because it's clearly the best of the three, seven meals,

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,700
it's no longer the necessary part of life I thought it was.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,500
What do you want people to remember you for 500 years from now?

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,900
I don't want to be remembered, I want to be alive.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,700
What is the most frivolous item you own?

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Man, that is a good question that had me looking up exactly what frivolous means,

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,200
not having purpose or value.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,100
So a thing I own which has neither purpose nor value,

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm not really sure anything I own fits that description, but I'll keep looking for you.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,400
If you have an idea in the shower without phone or notebook present, what do you do?

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Hey Siri!

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Make a note, must not forget, million, nay, billion dollar idea.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,100
Nice weather coming up for paradise in the United States.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,600
What do you think of jazz?

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Jazz is the opposite of everything I like in music.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,600
I want music to have patterns and repetition, patterns and repetition.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,100
This is why I also don't like live music.

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,600
I view music as a brain manipulation tool and to that end jazz is anti-useful to me.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,100
Do you still love music?

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
Jazz is anti-useful to me.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,200
If you had control of a super intelligence to which you could only give one command

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
and it would execute it to the best approximation of what you intended,

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,900
what would your one command be?

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,400
Minmax happiness and suffering.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh wait!

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,700
What's one thing that you're not satisfied with your life right now and how do you plan to solve it?

41
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,000
I've gotten into time tracking pretty deeply.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I used to just track my work hours, but I began to record how every hour of every day is spent.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,600
And let me tell you, no matter how well you think you spend your time

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,000
and no matter how well you do spend your time,

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
tracking all your time is an unflinching look into a mirror eternally uncomfortable.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,200
So I'm not thrilled with the way my pie chart for last year looks.

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,900
It was a year of chaos, but it's not possible to improve without knowing where you're starting.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,300
And one of the ways I'm working to make this better is simply to have the data about how I spend my time

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
more visible in more places.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
I've just begun in the most baby steps way possible,

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,500
but so far, making life more visible seems like a good feedback loop.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,300
How are you doing?

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Good thanks.

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,800
You?

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,200
If you had to enroll at a university tomorrow and had to choose one field of study, which would you choose?

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I'd like to say I'd take a programming course, but I'm pretty sure I couldn't pass at the university level.

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,100
Constants and functions and loops, oh my, are fun and clear, but once it gets to pointers, it's a level too far.

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,300
So if I needed to pass, I'd probably sign up for economics.

59
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,500
I dropped out of that master's course, as mentioned in a previous Q&A,

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,900
because it wasn't the right fit in my life at that time, but I'd be happy to give it a go again.

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,700
Of all the classes you've ever taken at uni, what was your hardest, what did you hate the most, why?

62
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,900
Well, the physics classes in my later years were the hardest,

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,600
and were probably the hardest intellectual thing I've ever done or will do.

64
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,300
But that's the boring-er question.

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,400
The more interesting question is which class I hated the most.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
That was a required humanities reading class.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,300
It was one of those classes where the professor had free reign to just select a bunch of books they liked,

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,200
and force students to read them and write essays agreeing with the professor,

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
or disagreeing in a way the professor agreed with.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
God, did I hate it.

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,400
I really think it's the kind of class that professors make mandatory because they like to teach it,

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,000
and it makes them look smart, and it's easy, and not because it's remotely good for the students involved.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,900
Anyway, it had to be done, and I had a pretty good idea in advance, I would hate it.

74
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,800
So at my college, there was an option to compress an entire academic year of these classes into one intense summer.

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,400
So I stayed at college over what was vacation for most people to finish this class as fast as possible.

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,800
I've always been pretty good at reading a lot using an on-off schedule when I need to, and it served me well here.

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,700
I think I read something like 30 stupid or boring or flowery or pompous books over that summer.

78
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,500
Anyway, it worked so well it was a strategy I used every summer,

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,000
compressing as many dumb mandatory classes into as short a time as possible.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,800
If your school gives that as an option, I highly recommend it so you have more time during the rest of the year to focus on more important things.

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,300
Raisins and chocolate chip cookies? Gross.

82
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,500
What noise do you wake up to? None.

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I used to use music to wake up to because this is the world's most unpleasant sound,

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,600
but doing so trains yourself to dislike whatever song you use

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,600
and have it randomly cause you a sense of drowning anxiety when you hear it in a different context.

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,100
I used to use a Sigur Ros song during my teaching years to wake me up,

87
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,100
and I still can't hear the opening few seconds without feeling like I'm drowning a decade later.

88
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,300
Of course, the sound may be none, but I currently use my Apple Watch to wake me up with a vibration,

89
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,100
and I know I'm in a good routine when I wake up naturally before it goes off.

90
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,300
If you could have one superpower, excluding the power to have all powers,

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,500
what would it be? Invulnerability with an exit option.

92
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,700
Can you wear silly ties for the rest of the video?

93
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,700
No, I spent years plotting and scheming how to escape the world of ties.

94
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,100
I will not go back to it now.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,400
You are given the opportunity to permanently and irreversibly change one fundamental law of physics.

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
What would it be and why?

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
On the panel of fundamental laws and constants, I drape a very big DO NOT TOUCH sign.

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,700
How do I get over a crippling Factorio addiction?

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,300
You tell me, man. I'm over a thousand hours deep.

100
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,100
Do you feel that humans need not apply needs updating?

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,300
Has anything changed since its creation that would change your message?

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,800
Not really anything I would change.

103
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,300
I do enjoy that the debate around autos has switched from they'll never happen to why aren't they here now?

104
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,500
Which is an interesting question.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,000
At least in this moment, it feels like progress in self-driving cars is a bit of an S-curve.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,700
So maybe I was over-optimistic about the rapid approach of commercially available autos,

107
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,400
but I still think they're coming and if I can't buy or rent an auto within 10 years of the publication of that video,

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,300
I'll be surprised and disappointed.

109
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,100
What is love?

110
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,600
What is love?

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,400
Baby, don't hurt me.

112
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't hurt me.

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,300
No more.
