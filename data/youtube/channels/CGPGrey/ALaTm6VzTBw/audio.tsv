0	2920	The way the workweek works is the worst.
2920	7200	Waking up on Monday, you've got five days in a row of work or school.
7200	8840	It's too much for
8840	11680	But by Wednesday, withered is your soul
11680	15920	with two more days, nay, three more days until the weekend.
15920	19280	But alas, the weekend is also broken.
19280	21520	Two is the wrong number of days off
21520	26040	because the first day off is just a collapse from the overly long workweek
26040	29640	and the second day off is tainted by the looming Monday.
29680	33480	The traditional weekend is, at best, 50% efficient.
33480	36440	It takes three days off just to feel like two days off
36440	39160	and two days off feels like one day off.
39160	41080	But here is where it gets interesting
41080	43880	because one day off isn't none day off.
43880	46560	A day off never goes unappreciated.
46560	49320	Which brings me to a new schedule for new living.
49320	50920	Weekend Wednesday.
50920	54200	Take the last three workdays, slide them over one slot
54200	57360	and bring the spare weekend day forward to Wednesday.
57400	62120	Now, when you wake up on Monday, there's only two days to go until Weekend Wednesday.
62120	64360	Then just three more days till Sunday.
64360	68080	I've been working on this schedule and boy, do I love it.
68080	69600	Here are the advantages.
69600	71680	Productivity goes down without breaks.
71680	75760	That's true on the scale of a day to the scale of a year or a life
75760	78360	and it's certainly true on the scale of a week.
78360	81560	Well-timed breaks equals a more effective you.
81560	83440	A two-day push followed by a break
83440	87480	then a three-day push and rest feels amazing on both cycles.
87480	91120	The days off are more relaxing and the days on more concentrated.
91120	93640	If you're self-employed with control over your schedule
93640	96480	or a student able to pick classes to keep days clear
96480	99080	I strongly suggest you give it a try.
99080	104120	And if you're an employer your employee is enthusiastically sharing this video with
104120	106720	it's worth considering if everyone is on board.
106720	110720	Now, of course, Weekend Wednesday won't work for the whole world and that's fine.
110720	114920	Better even, because that creates an off-cycle advantage for those of us who are on it.
114920	117520	Having a free day when everyone else is working
117520	121960	makes so many things easier and faster and crowdless.
121960	125400	As for the Saturday, you now have time to wrap up the work week
125400	127960	without interruptions from the rest of the world
127960	130800	leaving Sunday as a true day of rest.
130800	133680	So that's the glory of Weekend Wednesday.
133680	136320	More frequent days off that feel 100%,
136320	140880	more concentrated and shorter work sprints with a bonus off-cycle advantage.
140880	143560	If those sound intriguing, why not give it a try
143560	146200	and see if Weekend Wednesday works for you.
