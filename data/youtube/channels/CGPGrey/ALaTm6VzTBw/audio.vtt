00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
The way the workweek works is the worst.

00:02.920 --> 00:07.200
Waking up on Monday, you've got five days in a row of work or school.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.840
It's too much for

00:08.840 --> 00:11.680
But by Wednesday, withered is your soul

00:11.680 --> 00:15.920
with two more days, nay, three more days until the weekend.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.280
But alas, the weekend is also broken.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.520
Two is the wrong number of days off

00:21.520 --> 00:26.040
because the first day off is just a collapse from the overly long workweek

00:26.040 --> 00:29.640
and the second day off is tainted by the looming Monday.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.480
The traditional weekend is, at best, 50% efficient.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.440
It takes three days off just to feel like two days off

00:36.440 --> 00:39.160
and two days off feels like one day off.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.080
But here is where it gets interesting

00:41.080 --> 00:43.880
because one day off isn't none day off.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.560
A day off never goes unappreciated.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.320
Which brings me to a new schedule for new living.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.920
Weekend Wednesday.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.200
Take the last three workdays, slide them over one slot

00:54.200 --> 00:57.360
and bring the spare weekend day forward to Wednesday.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.120
Now, when you wake up on Monday, there's only two days to go until Weekend Wednesday.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.360
Then just three more days till Sunday.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.080
I've been working on this schedule and boy, do I love it.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.600
Here are the advantages.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.680
Productivity goes down without breaks.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.760
That's true on the scale of a day to the scale of a year or a life

01:15.760 --> 01:18.360
and it's certainly true on the scale of a week.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.560
Well-timed breaks equals a more effective you.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.440
A two-day push followed by a break

01:23.440 --> 01:27.480
then a three-day push and rest feels amazing on both cycles.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.120
The days off are more relaxing and the days on more concentrated.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.640
If you're self-employed with control over your schedule

01:33.640 --> 01:36.480
or a student able to pick classes to keep days clear

01:36.480 --> 01:39.080
I strongly suggest you give it a try.

01:39.080 --> 01:44.120
And if you're an employer your employee is enthusiastically sharing this video with

01:44.120 --> 01:46.720
it's worth considering if everyone is on board.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.720
Now, of course, Weekend Wednesday won't work for the whole world and that's fine.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.920
Better even, because that creates an off-cycle advantage for those of us who are on it.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.520
Having a free day when everyone else is working

01:57.520 --> 02:01.960
makes so many things easier and faster and crowdless.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.400
As for the Saturday, you now have time to wrap up the work week

02:05.400 --> 02:07.960
without interruptions from the rest of the world

02:07.960 --> 02:10.800
leaving Sunday as a true day of rest.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.680
So that's the glory of Weekend Wednesday.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.320
More frequent days off that feel 100%,

02:16.320 --> 02:20.880
more concentrated and shorter work sprints with a bonus off-cycle advantage.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.560
If those sound intriguing, why not give it a try

02:23.560 --> 02:26.200
and see if Weekend Wednesday works for you.
