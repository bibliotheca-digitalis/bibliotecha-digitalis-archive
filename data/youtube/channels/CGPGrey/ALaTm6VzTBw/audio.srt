1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
The way the workweek works is the worst.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,200
Waking up on Monday, you've got five days in a row of work or school.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,840
It's too much for

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,680
But by Wednesday, withered is your soul

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,920
with two more days, nay, three more days until the weekend.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,280
But alas, the weekend is also broken.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,520
Two is the wrong number of days off

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,040
because the first day off is just a collapse from the overly long workweek

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,640
and the second day off is tainted by the looming Monday.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,480
The traditional weekend is, at best, 50% efficient.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,440
It takes three days off just to feel like two days off

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,160
and two days off feels like one day off.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,080
But here is where it gets interesting

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,880
because one day off isn't none day off.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,560
A day off never goes unappreciated.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,320
Which brings me to a new schedule for new living.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,920
Weekend Wednesday.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,200
Take the last three workdays, slide them over one slot

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,360
and bring the spare weekend day forward to Wednesday.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,120
Now, when you wake up on Monday, there's only two days to go until Weekend Wednesday.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,360
Then just three more days till Sunday.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,080
I've been working on this schedule and boy, do I love it.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,600
Here are the advantages.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
Productivity goes down without breaks.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,760
That's true on the scale of a day to the scale of a year or a life

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,360
and it's certainly true on the scale of a week.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,560
Well-timed breaks equals a more effective you.

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,440
A two-day push followed by a break

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,480
then a three-day push and rest feels amazing on both cycles.

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,120
The days off are more relaxing and the days on more concentrated.

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,640
If you're self-employed with control over your schedule

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,480
or a student able to pick classes to keep days clear

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,080
I strongly suggest you give it a try.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,120
And if you're an employer your employee is enthusiastically sharing this video with

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,720
it's worth considering if everyone is on board.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Now, of course, Weekend Wednesday won't work for the whole world and that's fine.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,920
Better even, because that creates an off-cycle advantage for those of us who are on it.

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,520
Having a free day when everyone else is working

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,960
makes so many things easier and faster and crowdless.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,400
As for the Saturday, you now have time to wrap up the work week

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,960
without interruptions from the rest of the world

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,800
leaving Sunday as a true day of rest.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
So that's the glory of Weekend Wednesday.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,320
More frequent days off that feel 100%,

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,880
more concentrated and shorter work sprints with a bonus off-cycle advantage.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,560
If those sound intriguing, why not give it a try

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,200
and see if Weekend Wednesday works for you.
