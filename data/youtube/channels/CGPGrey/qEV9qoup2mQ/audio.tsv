0	5360	Ta-da! It's a video about Tiffany. I hope you like it.
5360	8240	Psst! Hey, hey, would you like to know more?
8240	11480	Okay, great. So listen, I need to tell you about this poem.
11480	15400	Come with me behind the scenes, where I've been working on this for...
15400	18980	I don't even know how long. Take a seat. Get comfortable.
18980	23540	It all began with these articles I read saying the name Tiffany is very old, maybe medieval.
23540	28200	What a cute and easy video, past Grey thought. And it could have been, it could have been,
28200	32960	if I'd just left things alone. But no, I wanted to read the article's sources,
32960	36200	which turned out didn't often contain the name Tiffany at all,
36200	40960	but rather the ye olden name Theophania, or the super old Theophanu.
40960	43920	And like, maybe these medieval ladies called themselves Tiff,
43920	46680	but that's just a bit too cute, isn't it?
46680	50920	To me, it looked like the sort of Lady Godiva story where later writers say a thing happened,
50920	54760	but there's no evidence from the time that it did, because it's a fairy tale,
54760	57360	the kind history is full of once you go looking.
57360	58360	Don't go looking.
58360	61240	So for a while, the Tiffany video teared on the edge of getting binned,
61240	63840	but it turned out my Lady Godiva suspicions were wrong
63840	66960	when some medieval Tiffany's did turn up to save the project.
66960	71800	But the poem happened before that, and listen, I need to tell you about it.
71800	76560	Otherwise, I might just explode, trying to contain all the excruciating details
76560	79640	and number of obsessive hours poured into this f-
79640	83840	poem, and I can't let it all have been for nothing.
83840	86800	Okay, ready? No? Too bad. Here's the poem.
86800	87520	Ahem.
87520	90920	William de Conasby came out of Brittany with his wife Tiffany
90920	94040	and his maid Manfass and his dog Hardegrass.
94040	95240	It's okay. That's it.
95240	99360	But what isn't okay is that this poem popped up in modern writings,
99360	102600	implying it's proof that Tiffany is maybe medieval,
102600	105720	but never with the poem's date or an author attached,
105720	108320	making it impossible to pin to a timeline.
108320	110360	Which made the poem annoying.
110360	113200	Doubly so, because it's supposed to be a joke.
113200	116200	Like, here it is in this 1859 history book
116200	119040	with this weird French-style humorous illustration,
119040	121760	but I don't get it. Is it the name of the dog?
121760	123080	What's the joke?
123080	125920	If you get it, please leave a comment. I just, I need to know.
125920	127600	Anyway, when you're reading about a topic,
127600	129600	this is the sort of thing that happens a lot.
129600	132440	There's some detail you keep stumbling over and over,
132440	134360	and it could be the critical clue.
134360	136520	I'm looking for the earliest Tiffany ANY.
136520	138800	There's a Tiffany ANY right here.
138800	142960	Maybe the very first, if I could just pin the poem to its proper place.
142960	143840	But no.
143840	146000	I had just resolved to give up on this poem
146000	148440	when the Tiffany's of America arrived at my door,
148440	150960	which I had ordered weeks ago?
150960	153480	To hopefully help with the main Tiffany video.
153480	157960	But it was just 90% a literal list of people named Tiffany in America,
157960	160400	with hilariously unclear photos.
160400	162480	The book was written by Nelson Otis Tiffany
162480	164240	and thanks Charles Lewis Tiffany
164240	168160	for making the book possible with his liberal contributions of money.
168160	169600	I love how explicit that is.
169600	170840	Then, totally unrelated,
170840	173520	there follows a description of how the Tiffany family crest is.
173520	176400	The most beautiful thing of its kind we have ever seen.
176400	180800	And then two pages of the densest family flattery ever put in print.
180800	184000	But in between those two sections, to mock me,
184000	185720	the poem appeared again.
185720	189200	Without a date, but with a footnote path to follow.
189200	191160	This is the moment I broke
191160	194080	and swore to the gods above and below
194080	198280	I would find the primary source of this Brittany Tiffany poem,
198280	201280	no matter the time, no matter the cost.
201280	203440	And when you give that to the gods,
203440	206400	they, of course, played a joke upon Grey,
206400	209920	making his pursuit of this poem as painful as possible.
209920	210800	Here's what happened.
210800	213040	The Tiffany's of America got the poem from
213040	215360	Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,
215360	218880	which I ordered and, when it arrived, found the full title to be
218880	220800	Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,
220800	223680	A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary
223680	225400	with Short Notices of Memorable Men.
225400	227320	I opened it and out fell an old map,
227320	230080	which is a thrilling moment, no matter what's mapped on the map,
230080	233360	after checking for spots marked X back to the book to find the poem,
233360	236200	which had a pencil highlight mark and a note below.
236200	238120	It seems whoever owned this book before me
238120	240600	was also on their own poetic Tiffany journey.
240600	242840	Maybe it was Nelson Otis Tiffany, I don't know.
242840	244720	So Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,
244720	247120	A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary
247120	248280	with Short Notices of Memorable Men,
248280	250520	lists the poem as from the author M. Thierry.
250520	253720	Now, buying old rare books gets expensive real fast,
253720	257760	so I headed down to my local library to try and track M. Thierry down,
257760	259160	which took a while because,
259160	261240	one, I didn't know then, but I do know now
261240	263440	that M is an old abbreviation for Mr.,
263440	266520	and the author referenced was Mr. Augustine Thierry,
266520	270000	and his book The History of the Conquest of England by the Normans,
270000	273360	and two, my library predates the Dewey Decimal System,
273360	275600	which makes every book search an adventure through
275600	278120	17th century organizational idiosyncrasy,
278120	280360	which is delightful when you're browsing,
280360	283880	but infuriating when you're in the wrong section about England,
283880	286000	and you can't find the book you're looking for
286000	288480	because you should be in the England-only section,
288480	290920	but not here behind the little book elevator.
290920	292600	Anyway, Thierry's book was on the shelf,
292600	293760	I grabbed it, sat down with it,
293760	295640	and flipped through the pages to find the poem.
295640	298400	And that History of the Conquest of England by the Normans
298400	300200	isn't the primary source either,
300200	304360	pointing to Hern, Pradiff, Ad, John, Defordum,
304360	306080	Scotachronicon?
306080	310040	Okay, what's the Scotachronicon?
310040	312880	According to Wikipedia, it's a history book of Scotland,
312880	315520	started in the 1300s by a priest in Aberdeen,
315520	317920	and continued after his death by an abbot in Inchcombe.
317920	320400	These historians worked to cover the history of Scotland
320400	323960	from their present day back to the literal Genesis,
323960	326880	a rather epic undertaking deserving the epic name
326880	328080	the Scotchonomichron.
328080	331760	Fun fact, this book is one of the earliest references to Robin Hood,
331760	333680	though the authors take a rather, hmm,
333680	336960	more dim view of the Hood and his hoi polloi fans
336960	338760	than most modern interpretations.
338800	342400	According to them, then arose the famous murderer Robin Hood
342400	344080	from Among the Disinherited,
344080	348440	whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating.
348440	350400	Interesting, but I didn't come to the library
350400	352600	to track down the earliest reference to Robin Hood.
352600	354320	It's a Piers Plowman poems, by the way.
354320	356040	I'm here to find the Scotchochromicon
356040	360000	in the Scotland History section, which is in the dark.
360000	363240	I'm sure glad my phone has a flashlight.
363240	365640	There it is.
365640	367200	The Scotcheronomicon.
367400	369360	Look at all these handwritten notes.
369360	373000	Last time this was checked out was 1995.
373000	375760	Alas, there was no poem on page 172,
375760	378360	but maybe that page number was for a different edition,
378360	382000	so there was nothing to do but start flipping and skimming,
382000	386600	flipping and skimming, over and over and over and over
386600	391600	and over and over through every single crinkly page
391840	395280	to find the Brittany Tiffany poem nowhere.
395280	398840	Maybe the poem was among those pages and I just missed it.
398840	401040	I mean, the book is in Latin.
401040	402560	It turned out not.
402560	403840	I didn't know it at the time,
403840	407480	but I did have the wrong edition, but in an unexpected way.
407480	410840	This one printed in M-D-C-C-L-I-X,
410840	412520	but if you were to search further,
412520	415360	say at the largest library in the world
415360	417480	with 200 million volumes,
417480	422480	you could find an earlier edition printed in M-D-C-C-X-X-I-I,
422840	426720	which was both much smaller and with hilariously large font
426720	428840	like the author was trying to puff up the book.
428840	431000	But in this one on page 170,
431000	434320	there she was, Brittany Tiffany A-N-Y.
434320	436400	I was thrilled to have found
436400	438920	truly medieval evidence of Tiffany.
438920	441080	I had the primary source.
441080	444560	I could pin the poem to the 1400s,
444560	447240	or so I thought until I remembered
447240	449080	that these guys wrote in Latin
449080	452560	and this poem is in modern-ish English.
452560	453880	How could that be?
453880	455320	Well, it's because this poem
455320	457440	isn't in the Scatronicon at all.
457440	461680	It's a footnote added by the editor of this 1722 edition.
461680	464400	And it's also not the primary source,
464400	465400	the editor adding,
465400	468000	in an ancient writing of parchment kept charily
468000	470760	by the family of the Conasby among their records,
470760	472000	they have this written.
472000	476200	Charily, that's an old word that means cautious or warily.
476200	477200	That's weird.
477200	478200	And ancient?
478200	479360	How ancient?
479360	481000	Fast forward past much time spent
481000	483320	searching Conasby family records without luck.
483320	485360	Though, of course, now that I'm talking about this,
485360	487720	I know some long descendant of the Conasby clan
487720	489720	will show up at my door with a reliquary box
489720	490720	in the poem inside,
490720	493120	which I'll need to send off for some radiocarbon dating.
493120	495400	And I also know that every example
495400	497000	of an old Tiffany A-N-Y
497000	499000	will be sent to my door forevermore,
499000	500520	but that's future Grey's problem.
500520	501480	For current Grey,
501480	503440	well, now past Grey at the time of writing and research,
503440	506200	the one path the gods had directed before me,
506200	508400	I wish I had not followed through.
508400	511200	Who is Theo Hernias, the editor?
511200	512120	Well, to find out,
512120	515800	step one is to find his non-Latinized name, Thomas Hearn.
515800	518680	Thomas Hearn was, eh, well, we'll get to that,
518680	520720	but he worked at the Bodleian Library at Oxford
520720	522000	in the early 1700s
522000	524240	and published lots of editions of medieval texts,
524240	525640	scotochromicon among them.
525640	527360	Now, trying to find more information
527360	530400	about why someone wrote a footnote 300 years ago
530400	531240	seemed hopeless,
531240	533240	but Google, against all odds,
533240	535880	turned up the collected letters of Alexander Pope,
535880	537840	a contemporary of Hearn's in England
537840	542120	who wrote a 35-page letter about Hearn that begins,
558120	559360	which at first sounds like,
559360	560560	wow, what a fan,
560560	563440	and this 35-page letter by Alexander Pope
563440	565920	happens to mention the Brittany Tiffany poem,
565920	568240	though in a context that seems...
568240	568760	off?
568760	570800	Saying Hearn had so many,
570800	572680	not just historical documents,
572680	574200	but poems in particular,
574200	577040	that it would waste your time to tell you about all of them.
577040	580120	Pope then says Hearn wanted to be useful by saving them all,
580120	584240	but then lists several clearly useful-to-no-one-ever poems,
584240	585640	including Brittany Tiffany.
585640	587120	It's just sort of weird,
587120	588560	and I would've left it at that,
588560	589800	should've left it at that,
589800	592240	but then this passage caught my eye.
592240	594640	We have taken the liberty to correct some
594640	596360	few mistakes in Hearn's writing,
596360	599480	and been careful not to offend any impartial reader.
599480	601520	We have avoided flattery on one hand,
601520	603160	and scandal on the other.
603160	603960	That's a very
603960	605280	I don't love drama
605280	606800	sentence from Pope, isn't it?
606800	609800	I'm just somehow always at the centre of drama.
609800	611360	Oh, this burn book?
611360	612040	It's nothing.
612040	614320	Just where I write down my ideas for plays.
614320	616000	I'm a literal dramatist, you know.
616000	619200	Pope then goes on to fill his 35-page letter with
619200	624000	Nothing but corrections for every mistake Hearn ever made
624000	627040	in all of his work in this infuriating
627040	630040	oh-let-me-just-help-you-out-Hearn kind of way.
630040	632800	Some observations on his writing indeed.
632800	634760	Hearn gets a date wrong, and Pope says
634760	635640	I'm sorry, Hearn.
635640	637880	See here, where you wrote 1274,
637880	641320	you have either not kept up with your avowed regard for truth,
641320	644160	or unhappily blundered in a point of chronology.
644160	647640	You say this man in 1274 studied at Canterbury College,
647640	648640	and he wrote about it,
648640	653080	but I'm afraid to tell you the college was not built until 1363.
653080	657120	Therefore, this man must have either lived 89 years before he was born,
657120	660360	or written of a place many years before it was built.
660360	662360	Oh, Hearn, now don't be annoyed.
662360	665760	These corrections, how much so ever they may look like ridicule,
665760	668680	are undoubted confirmations of your industry,
668680	672480	and will ever be thought so by persons of deeper penetration.
672480	674080	Me? Yow.
674080	675920	Alexander Pope, it turns out,
675960	678200	is the human who coined the phrase
680440	683000	Of course, only after reading the entire letter
683000	684520	did I realize I could have skipped it,
684520	688560	had I first seen Pope hanging out on the bottom of Hearn's Wikipedia page,
688560	692320	calling Hearn's life work unappealing and monkish.
692320	694880	Hearn complained into his diary that Alexander Pope,
694880	697000	one of the most quoted authors in the English language,
697000	700360	just below Shakespeare and the Bible, lacked scholarship.
700360	702760	Alexander Pope, in turn, created a character
702760	706520	for one of his plays based on Hearn named Wormius,
706520	708840	a no-nothing, know-it-all pedant.
708840	711000	Hearn shot back, saying Pope's play was
715080	718360	This delicious beef was the only highlight of my reading,
718360	720320	so I needed to know more.
720320	724840	But putting plus Hearn plus Wormius into Google returned exactly one result,
724840	728040	the Wikipedia page itself, which is super sus.
728040	731160	I mean, does information even exist if it's not on the internet?
731160	732160	Oh right, of course.
732160	734320	So I had to check the listed footnote,
734320	736640	which wasn't at the library, so I ordered the book,
736640	739880	it arrived, I opened it, I read it, and the Hearn-Wormius thing checks out.
739880	740720	Amazing.
740720	745080	But even after that, Alexander Pope just couldn't let it go for some reason,
745080	747120	and after Hearn's death, he wrote,
747120	749680	Hearn was a most sordid, poor wretch.
749680	753600	He had universal mistrust of the generality of mankind,
753600	756200	lived in a slovenly, stingy manner,
756200	760840	and died possessed of what he had not the heart to enjoy.
760840	763040	Alex, jeez!
763040	766920	Uh, so, as you can see, we've traveled down many paths here,
766920	771800	and at this point, I really needed a friend to talk to about this in my life.
771800	774720	The number of people willing to listen for months on end
774720	779520	to updates about not even the very broad topic of the origin of the name Tiffany,
779520	780720	remember, that's where we started,
780720	786320	not even of the exact original source of one poem that mentions the name Tiffany A-N-Y,
786320	792360	but of two dead dudes' schoolboy-level squabbles that are tangentially related to Tiffany,
792360	793800	is zero.
793800	795200	But then there was hope.
795200	797520	I can't even remember how I found it now,
797520	801640	but I came across another Hearn burn via historian John Horace Round
801640	805960	in his Feudal England, Historical Studies on the X-Ith and X-Ith-Ith Centuries,
805960	809080	complaining about Hearn's lack of document date questioning,
809080	812600	ignoring of internal evidence and superficial examinations,
812600	817560	leading to publishing more wrong dates polluting the timeline for everyone.
817560	822440	Oh, and Hearn also got the poem's surname spelling wrong, twice,
822440	826440	which is why nothing turned up for Conisbee family records earlier.
826440	827160	Oof.
827160	829960	At this point, Hearn having cost me so much time,
829960	831480	and feeling so thoroughly alone in the world,
831480	835960	I was excited to find in John Horace Round a friend to phone and complain with over coffee.
835960	838520	As it happens, he even translated part of the Doomsday book,
838520	843320	which was the very first source I checked when starting the Tiffany project so long ago.
843320	845320	We were going to have loads to talk about!
845320	847960	While searching for his digits, I realized, in my excitement,
847960	851080	I had missed the original publication date of his work.
851080	854840	Round had died a hundred years ago, and I was back to being Grey Gnomates.
854840	855800	As usual.
855800	856760	Okay, so look.
856760	863720	This side path I've been carving out to even be able to talk about the Brittany Tiffany poem
863720	872360	is only a tiny, tiny part of all of the explorations that had to happen to make the main Tiffany video.
872360	875880	I've been here alone for, oh gods,
875880	881640	half a year as the only one alive who cares about any of this.
881640	884520	This script is so long now.
884520	886600	Will anyone make it this far?
886600	887640	Is anyone here?
890200	891400	Okay, snap out of it.
891400	894920	Now, in my journeys, I had learned two things about Hearn.
894920	898040	First, his contemporaries referred to him as an antiquarian,
898040	901000	which in my head translated as old-timey for historian,
901000	903560	but was actually old-timey code for hoarder.
903560	907000	Hearn loved collecting every historic document he could find,
907000	909880	but was not very good at sorting them out.
909880	912600	The second thing was that Hearn's edition of the Scottronomicon,
912600	915880	from which all sources pointed back to as the providence of the poem,
915880	917240	is worse than useless,
917240	920360	as not only are his contributions of dubious value,
920360	923240	but he also took it upon himself to cut out a lot,
923240	926920	which explains why his edition was printed in giant font.
926920	929160	This is not considered canonical.
929160	931640	And this should have been the end of it,
931640	935240	but there was still something left to try to pin to the timeline.
935240	938440	Was this Tiffany A.N.Y. a real person?
938440	940040	And when did she live?
940040	940920	Okay, I know.
940920	944120	In retrospect, it seems obvious I should have started here.
944120	945640	Painfully obvious.
945640	950040	But you only know at the end what is the fastest way from the beginning.
950040	951480	Now, surely, I thought,
951480	955560	at least tracking down genealogical records of the family the poem mentioned,
955560	957320	everything would check out.
957320	958440	Right? Wrong.
958440	962760	So, as a reminder, the poem starts with William from Brittany, wife Tiffany.
962760	967720	William Conasby was a real person in the 1300s in England, not Brittany.
967720	970440	And his wife was Beatrice, not Tiffany.
970440	973320	They had a son, Thomas Conasby, who did go to Brittany,
973320	975640	with the Black Prince, who was alive at the time, to battle.
975640	978280	And Thomas, while fighting, became a prisoner of war.
978280	983000	However, his captor agreed to let Thomas go if he would marry his daughter, Tiffany.
983000	987080	Which he did, and it was Thomas who came out of Brittany with his wife, Tiffany.
987080	991560	Except not, because if you look up her paperwork, her name is actually Theophania!
991560	993880	She's only called Tiffany hundreds of years later!
993880	996280	So the poem isn't right about anything!
996280	998040	God damn you, Hearn!
998040	999560	Everything is wrong!
999560	1003000	And the poem is evidence of nothing useful at all!
1004440	1005560	I'm sorry.
1005560	1006520	It's just...
1006520	1007800	It's been a lot.
1007800	1009560	So here's the final working theory.
1009560	1013080	Hearn knew the Conasby family, who either told him of the poem,
1013080	1016680	or perhaps he spotted it himself, expressed an outsized interest
1016680	1019960	in their collection of old papers, as he was wont to do.
1019960	1023720	But either way, when editing his edition of the Scotachronicon,
1023720	1026680	and it mentioned the family, that triggered his memory,
1026680	1028520	and he added in his footnote.
1028520	1031400	Wrong as he saw it, or wrong as he remembered it.
1031400	1035320	That note in his non-canonical edition, through pure bad luck,
1035320	1038760	got swept up in the paper-writing-footnote-copy-paste game
1038760	1040920	where no one checks the original,
1040920	1047160	and the context that the name Tiffany is not actually in the original book got lost.
1047160	1049880	At least, now the timeline is complete,
1049880	1056360	but all this work has shown is that in the 1700s the name Tiffany A&Y existed,
1056360	1059880	which was not in question at all at the beginning.
1059880	1063400	For the gods' capricious tormenting pleasure alone,
1063400	1068200	this path went absolutely nowhere, provided nothing of value,
1068200	1071960	and drained many hours of my sadly finite life.
1072520	1072840	Uh...
1074120	1075640	Thanks for listening?
1075640	1079240	I guess I just really needed to get out all of this frustration
1079240	1085240	to tell you the story of tracking down a poem that didn't even make it into the main video.
1086360	1087640	The end.
1091880	1092280	Hello.
1093640	1097160	Thank you for making it to not just the end of the video,
1097160	1099240	but after the end of the video.
1099960	1100360	Welcome.
1101160	1106600	Well, that ended up being quite a journey over the past half a year.
1107160	1113320	Sometimes in making a video, the path through the forest of all knowledge is clearly marked out.
1114200	1120840	Other times you have something much more difficult to try to get through.
1121560	1122680	Oh, don't step on the...
1123640	1123960	Whoa!
1126040	1129160	And occasionally there's almost nothing,
1130360	1134680	and you're in danger of getting quite lost.
1134680	1135560	But this is the job.
1136440	1142040	To turn something that is unmarked into something that's slightly marked.
1142840	1146040	Perhaps something that's been completed with trusses
1146920	1149480	to get you over the dangerous and difficult parts.
1150040	1154440	Some of the videos I make take unreasonably long amounts of time
1154440	1157080	and unreasonably large amounts of effort.
1158200	1162040	Things that are frankly not very good business sense
1162040	1165000	from a YouTube algorithm sort of way,
1165000	1170760	but I know that as a viewer I love it when people make those sorts of videos.
1170760	1173640	And I imagine if you're still watching,
1173640	1176840	you're one of the people who likes those kinds of videos as well.
1176840	1181720	I've resisted for years coming up with a name for the people who support the channel.
1181720	1183320	I've never really liked that stuff,
1183320	1188520	but I've changed my thoughts on that because I realize that they really are part of the team now.
1189320	1193240	And I know how this is going to sound, but I really mean it.
1194120	1202520	The past six months I have definitely felt very alone at times working on this.
1202520	1209240	But one of the things that has helped me push on with a crazy project like this
1209240	1215160	is knowing that there are a lot of people who really care about these videos.
1215960	1219960	The capricious whims of the YouTube gods cannot be relied upon,
1219960	1223560	but people willing to back projects directly that they really like?
1224360	1226600	It means so much.
1228040	1231080	These videos aren't for everyone, they're for you.
1231960	1236520	So if you would like to become a Bonnie B and help support the creation of future videos,
1236520	1241560	which will also get you access to some of the behind the scenes of how the videos are made,
1241560	1243960	I just have one requirement first.
1243960	1246280	You must be financially self-supporting.
1246280	1248520	So no students in particular.
1249400	1256360	I want people to work on themselves and work on their own lives before they try to help me out.
1256360	1257640	I will be fine.
1257640	1259400	Make sure you're good first.
1259400	1263160	And I plan on doing this for a long time.
1263160	1265320	I have been doing this for a long time.
1265320	1266520	I'll be here later.
1267080	1272520	So as long as you're set there, if you would like to join, you can click here.
1272520	1274280	And thank you so much.
1275240	1277800	I'll see you in the next video.
