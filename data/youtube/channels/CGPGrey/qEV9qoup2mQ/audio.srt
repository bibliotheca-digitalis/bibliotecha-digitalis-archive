1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Ta-da! It's a video about Tiffany. I hope you like it.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,240
Psst! Hey, hey, would you like to know more?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,480
Okay, great. So listen, I need to tell you about this poem.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,400
Come with me behind the scenes, where I've been working on this for...

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,980
I don't even know how long. Take a seat. Get comfortable.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,540
It all began with these articles I read saying the name Tiffany is very old, maybe medieval.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,200
What a cute and easy video, past Grey thought. And it could have been, it could have been,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,960
if I'd just left things alone. But no, I wanted to read the article's sources,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,200
which turned out didn't often contain the name Tiffany at all,

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,960
but rather the ye olden name Theophania, or the super old Theophanu.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
And like, maybe these medieval ladies called themselves Tiff,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,680
but that's just a bit too cute, isn't it?

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,920
To me, it looked like the sort of Lady Godiva story where later writers say a thing happened,

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,760
but there's no evidence from the time that it did, because it's a fairy tale,

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,360
the kind history is full of once you go looking.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Don't go looking.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,240
So for a while, the Tiffany video teared on the edge of getting binned,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,840
but it turned out my Lady Godiva suspicions were wrong

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
when some medieval Tiffany's did turn up to save the project.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,800
But the poem happened before that, and listen, I need to tell you about it.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,560
Otherwise, I might just explode, trying to contain all the excruciating details

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,640
and number of obsessive hours poured into this f-

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,840
poem, and I can't let it all have been for nothing.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,800
Okay, ready? No? Too bad. Here's the poem.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,520
Ahem.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,920
William de Conasby came out of Brittany with his wife Tiffany

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,040
and his maid Manfass and his dog Hardegrass.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,240
It's okay. That's it.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,360
But what isn't okay is that this poem popped up in modern writings,

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,600
implying it's proof that Tiffany is maybe medieval,

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,720
but never with the poem's date or an author attached,

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,320
making it impossible to pin to a timeline.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,360
Which made the poem annoying.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Doubly so, because it's supposed to be a joke.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Like, here it is in this 1859 history book

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,040
with this weird French-style humorous illustration,

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,760
but I don't get it. Is it the name of the dog?

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
What's the joke?

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,920
If you get it, please leave a comment. I just, I need to know.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
Anyway, when you're reading about a topic,

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
this is the sort of thing that happens a lot.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,440
There's some detail you keep stumbling over and over,

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
and it could be the critical clue.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm looking for the earliest Tiffany ANY.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,800
There's a Tiffany ANY right here.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,960
Maybe the very first, if I could just pin the poem to its proper place.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,840
But no.

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
I had just resolved to give up on this poem

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,440
when the Tiffany's of America arrived at my door,

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,960
which I had ordered weeks ago?

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,480
To hopefully help with the main Tiffany video.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,960
But it was just 90% a literal list of people named Tiffany in America,

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,400
with hilariously unclear photos.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
The book was written by Nelson Otis Tiffany

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,240
and thanks Charles Lewis Tiffany

56
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,160
for making the book possible with his liberal contributions of money.

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
I love how explicit that is.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,840
Then, totally unrelated,

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,520
there follows a description of how the Tiffany family crest is.

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,400
The most beautiful thing of its kind we have ever seen.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
And then two pages of the densest family flattery ever put in print.

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
But in between those two sections, to mock me,

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,720
the poem appeared again.

64
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,200
Without a date, but with a footnote path to follow.

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,160
This is the moment I broke

66
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,080
and swore to the gods above and below

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,280
I would find the primary source of this Brittany Tiffany poem,

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,280
no matter the time, no matter the cost.

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
And when you give that to the gods,

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
they, of course, played a joke upon Grey,

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
making his pursuit of this poem as painful as possible.

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,800
Here's what happened.

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,040
The Tiffany's of America got the poem from

74
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,880
which I ordered and, when it arrived, found the full title to be

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,800
Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,680
A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,400
with Short Notices of Memorable Men.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,320
I opened it and out fell an old map,

80
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,080
which is a thrilling moment, no matter what's mapped on the map,

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
after checking for spots marked X back to the book to find the poem,

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,200
which had a pencil highlight mark and a note below.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,120
It seems whoever owned this book before me

84
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,600
was also on their own poetic Tiffany journey.

85
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,840
Maybe it was Nelson Otis Tiffany, I don't know.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,720
So Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,280
with Short Notices of Memorable Men,

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,520
lists the poem as from the author M. Thierry.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,720
Now, buying old rare books gets expensive real fast,

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,760
so I headed down to my local library to try and track M. Thierry down,

92
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
which took a while because,

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,240
one, I didn't know then, but I do know now

94
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,440
that M is an old abbreviation for Mr.,

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,520
and the author referenced was Mr. Augustine Thierry,

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,000
and his book The History of the Conquest of England by the Normans,

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
and two, my library predates the Dewey Decimal System,

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,600
which makes every book search an adventure through

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,120
17th century organizational idiosyncrasy,

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,360
which is delightful when you're browsing,

101
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,880
but infuriating when you're in the wrong section about England,

102
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,000
and you can't find the book you're looking for

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,480
because you should be in the England-only section,

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,920
but not here behind the little book elevator.

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
Anyway, Thierry's book was on the shelf,

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
I grabbed it, sat down with it,

107
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
and flipped through the pages to find the poem.

108
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,400
And that History of the Conquest of England by the Normans

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
isn't the primary source either,

110
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,360
pointing to Hern, Pradiff, Ad, John, Defordum,

111
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,080
Scotachronicon?

112
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,040
Okay, what's the Scotachronicon?

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,880
According to Wikipedia, it's a history book of Scotland,

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
started in the 1300s by a priest in Aberdeen,

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,920
and continued after his death by an abbot in Inchcombe.

116
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,400
These historians worked to cover the history of Scotland

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,960
from their present day back to the literal Genesis,

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,880
a rather epic undertaking deserving the epic name

119
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
the Scotchonomichron.

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,760
Fun fact, this book is one of the earliest references to Robin Hood,

121
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,680
though the authors take a rather, hmm,

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
more dim view of the Hood and his hoi polloi fans

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
than most modern interpretations.

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
According to them, then arose the famous murderer Robin Hood

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,080
from Among the Disinherited,

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,440
whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating.

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Interesting, but I didn't come to the library

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
to track down the earliest reference to Robin Hood.

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,320
It's a Piers Plowman poems, by the way.

130
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm here to find the Scotchochromicon

131
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,000
in the Scotland History section, which is in the dark.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,240
I'm sure glad my phone has a flashlight.

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,640
There it is.

134
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,200
The Scotcheronomicon.

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,360
Look at all these handwritten notes.

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,000
Last time this was checked out was 1995.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Alas, there was no poem on page 172,

138
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,360
but maybe that page number was for a different edition,

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,000
so there was nothing to do but start flipping and skimming,

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,600
flipping and skimming, over and over and over and over

141
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
and over and over through every single crinkly page

142
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
to find the Brittany Tiffany poem nowhere.

143
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,840
Maybe the poem was among those pages and I just missed it.

144
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,040
I mean, the book is in Latin.

145
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
It turned out not.

146
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
I didn't know it at the time,

147
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,480
but I did have the wrong edition, but in an unexpected way.

148
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,840
This one printed in M-D-C-C-L-I-X,

149
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,520
but if you were to search further,

150
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,360
say at the largest library in the world

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
with 200 million volumes,

152
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,480
you could find an earlier edition printed in M-D-C-C-X-X-I-I,

153
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,720
which was both much smaller and with hilariously large font

154
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,840
like the author was trying to puff up the book.

155
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,000
But in this one on page 170,

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,320
there she was, Brittany Tiffany A-N-Y.

157
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,400
I was thrilled to have found

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,920
truly medieval evidence of Tiffany.

159
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,080
I had the primary source.

160
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,560
I could pin the poem to the 1400s,

161
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,240
or so I thought until I remembered

162
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,080
that these guys wrote in Latin

163
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,560
and this poem is in modern-ish English.

164
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,880
How could that be?

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
Well, it's because this poem

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,440
isn't in the Scatronicon at all.

167
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,680
It's a footnote added by the editor of this 1722 edition.

168
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
And it's also not the primary source,

169
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
the editor adding,

170
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
in an ancient writing of parchment kept charily

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,760
by the family of the Conasby among their records,

172
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
they have this written.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,200
Charily, that's an old word that means cautious or warily.

174
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
That's weird.

175
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
And ancient?

176
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
How ancient?

177
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,000
Fast forward past much time spent

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,320
searching Conasby family records without luck.

179
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Though, of course, now that I'm talking about this,

180
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,720
I know some long descendant of the Conasby clan

181
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
will show up at my door with a reliquary box

182
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
in the poem inside,

183
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
which I'll need to send off for some radiocarbon dating.

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,400
And I also know that every example

185
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,000
of an old Tiffany A-N-Y

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
will be sent to my door forevermore,

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,520
but that's future Grey's problem.

188
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
For current Grey,

189
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,440
well, now past Grey at the time of writing and research,

190
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,200
the one path the gods had directed before me,

191
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,400
I wish I had not followed through.

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Who is Theo Hernias, the editor?

193
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,120
Well, to find out,

194
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,800
step one is to find his non-Latinized name, Thomas Hearn.

195
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,680
Thomas Hearn was, eh, well, we'll get to that,

196
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,720
but he worked at the Bodleian Library at Oxford

197
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,000
in the early 1700s

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
and published lots of editions of medieval texts,

199
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,640
scotochromicon among them.

200
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,360
Now, trying to find more information

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,400
about why someone wrote a footnote 300 years ago

202
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
seemed hopeless,

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
but Google, against all odds,

204
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,880
turned up the collected letters of Alexander Pope,

205
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,840
a contemporary of Hearn's in England

206
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,120
who wrote a 35-page letter about Hearn that begins,

207
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,360
which at first sounds like,

208
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
wow, what a fan,

209
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
and this 35-page letter by Alexander Pope

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
happens to mention the Brittany Tiffany poem,

211
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
though in a context that seems...

212
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,760
off?

213
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,800
Saying Hearn had so many,

214
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,680
not just historical documents,

215
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,200
but poems in particular,

216
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,040
that it would waste your time to tell you about all of them.

217
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Pope then says Hearn wanted to be useful by saving them all,

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,240
but then lists several clearly useful-to-no-one-ever poems,

219
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,640
including Brittany Tiffany.

220
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
It's just sort of weird,

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
and I would've left it at that,

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,800
should've left it at that,

223
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,240
but then this passage caught my eye.

224
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
We have taken the liberty to correct some

225
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,360
few mistakes in Hearn's writing,

226
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,480
and been careful not to offend any impartial reader.

227
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,520
We have avoided flattery on one hand,

228
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,160
and scandal on the other.

229
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,960
That's a very

230
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,280
I don't love drama

231
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,800
sentence from Pope, isn't it?

232
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm just somehow always at the centre of drama.

233
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,360
Oh, this burn book?

234
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,040
It's nothing.

235
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,320
Just where I write down my ideas for plays.

236
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm a literal dramatist, you know.

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Pope then goes on to fill his 35-page letter with

238
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Nothing but corrections for every mistake Hearn ever made

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
in all of his work in this infuriating

240
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,040
oh-let-me-just-help-you-out-Hearn kind of way.

241
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,800
Some observations on his writing indeed.

242
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,760
Hearn gets a date wrong, and Pope says

243
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm sorry, Hearn.

244
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,880
See here, where you wrote 1274,

245
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,320
you have either not kept up with your avowed regard for truth,

246
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,160
or unhappily blundered in a point of chronology.

247
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,640
You say this man in 1274 studied at Canterbury College,

248
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
and he wrote about it,

249
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,080
but I'm afraid to tell you the college was not built until 1363.

250
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,120
Therefore, this man must have either lived 89 years before he was born,

251
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,360
or written of a place many years before it was built.

252
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Oh, Hearn, now don't be annoyed.

253
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,760
These corrections, how much so ever they may look like ridicule,

254
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,680
are undoubted confirmations of your industry,

255
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,480
and will ever be thought so by persons of deeper penetration.

256
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Me? Yow.

257
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,920
Alexander Pope, it turns out,

258
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,200
is the human who coined the phrase

259
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,000
Of course, only after reading the entire letter

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,520
did I realize I could have skipped it,

261
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,560
had I first seen Pope hanging out on the bottom of Hearn's Wikipedia page,

262
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,320
calling Hearn's life work unappealing and monkish.

263
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
Hearn complained into his diary that Alexander Pope,

264
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,000
one of the most quoted authors in the English language,

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,360
just below Shakespeare and the Bible, lacked scholarship.

266
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,760
Alexander Pope, in turn, created a character

267
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,520
for one of his plays based on Hearn named Wormius,

268
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,840
a no-nothing, know-it-all pedant.

269
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,000
Hearn shot back, saying Pope's play was

270
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,360
This delicious beef was the only highlight of my reading,

271
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,320
so I needed to know more.

272
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,840
But putting plus Hearn plus Wormius into Google returned exactly one result,

273
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,040
the Wikipedia page itself, which is super sus.

274
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,160
I mean, does information even exist if it's not on the internet?

275
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh right, of course.

276
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
So I had to check the listed footnote,

277
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,640
which wasn't at the library, so I ordered the book,

278
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,880
it arrived, I opened it, I read it, and the Hearn-Wormius thing checks out.

279
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,720
Amazing.

280
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,080
But even after that, Alexander Pope just couldn't let it go for some reason,

281
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,120
and after Hearn's death, he wrote,

282
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,680
Hearn was a most sordid, poor wretch.

283
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
He had universal mistrust of the generality of mankind,

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
lived in a slovenly, stingy manner,

285
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,840
and died possessed of what he had not the heart to enjoy.

286
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,040
Alex, jeez!

287
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,920
Uh, so, as you can see, we've traveled down many paths here,

288
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,800
and at this point, I really needed a friend to talk to about this in my life.

289
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,720
The number of people willing to listen for months on end

290
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,520
to updates about not even the very broad topic of the origin of the name Tiffany,

291
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
remember, that's where we started,

292
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,320
not even of the exact original source of one poem that mentions the name Tiffany A-N-Y,

293
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,360
but of two dead dudes' schoolboy-level squabbles that are tangentially related to Tiffany,

294
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,800
is zero.

295
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
But then there was hope.

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,520
I can't even remember how I found it now,

297
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,640
but I came across another Hearn burn via historian John Horace Round

298
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,960
in his Feudal England, Historical Studies on the X-Ith and X-Ith-Ith Centuries,

299
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,080
complaining about Hearn's lack of document date questioning,

300
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,600
ignoring of internal evidence and superficial examinations,

301
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,560
leading to publishing more wrong dates polluting the timeline for everyone.

302
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,440
Oh, and Hearn also got the poem's surname spelling wrong, twice,

303
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,440
which is why nothing turned up for Conisbee family records earlier.

304
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,160
Oof.

305
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,960
At this point, Hearn having cost me so much time,

306
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,480
and feeling so thoroughly alone in the world,

307
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,960
I was excited to find in John Horace Round a friend to phone and complain with over coffee.

308
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,520
As it happens, he even translated part of the Doomsday book,

309
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,320
which was the very first source I checked when starting the Tiffany project so long ago.

310
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
We were going to have loads to talk about!

311
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,960
While searching for his digits, I realized, in my excitement,

312
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,080
I had missed the original publication date of his work.

313
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,840
Round had died a hundred years ago, and I was back to being Grey Gnomates.

314
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,800
As usual.

315
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,760
Okay, so look.

316
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:23,720
This side path I've been carving out to even be able to talk about the Brittany Tiffany poem

317
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:32,360
is only a tiny, tiny part of all of the explorations that had to happen to make the main Tiffany video.

318
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,880
I've been here alone for, oh gods,

319
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,640
half a year as the only one alive who cares about any of this.

320
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,520
This script is so long now.

321
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,600
Will anyone make it this far?

322
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,640
Is anyone here?

323
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Okay, snap out of it.

324
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,920
Now, in my journeys, I had learned two things about Hearn.

325
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,040
First, his contemporaries referred to him as an antiquarian,

326
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,000
which in my head translated as old-timey for historian,

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,560
but was actually old-timey code for hoarder.

328
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,000
Hearn loved collecting every historic document he could find,

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
but was not very good at sorting them out.

330
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,600
The second thing was that Hearn's edition of the Scottronomicon,

331
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,880
from which all sources pointed back to as the providence of the poem,

332
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,240
is worse than useless,

333
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,360
as not only are his contributions of dubious value,

334
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,240
but he also took it upon himself to cut out a lot,

335
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,920
which explains why his edition was printed in giant font.

336
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,160
This is not considered canonical.

337
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,640
And this should have been the end of it,

338
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,240
but there was still something left to try to pin to the timeline.

339
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,440
Was this Tiffany A.N.Y. a real person?

340
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,040
And when did she live?

341
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,920
Okay, I know.

342
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,120
In retrospect, it seems obvious I should have started here.

343
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,640
Painfully obvious.

344
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,040
But you only know at the end what is the fastest way from the beginning.

345
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,480
Now, surely, I thought,

346
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,560
at least tracking down genealogical records of the family the poem mentioned,

347
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,320
everything would check out.

348
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
Right? Wrong.

349
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,760
So, as a reminder, the poem starts with William from Brittany, wife Tiffany.

350
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,720
William Conasby was a real person in the 1300s in England, not Brittany.

351
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,440
And his wife was Beatrice, not Tiffany.

352
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,320
They had a son, Thomas Conasby, who did go to Brittany,

353
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,640
with the Black Prince, who was alive at the time, to battle.

354
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,280
And Thomas, while fighting, became a prisoner of war.

355
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,000
However, his captor agreed to let Thomas go if he would marry his daughter, Tiffany.

356
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,080
Which he did, and it was Thomas who came out of Brittany with his wife, Tiffany.

357
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,560
Except not, because if you look up her paperwork, her name is actually Theophania!

358
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,880
She's only called Tiffany hundreds of years later!

359
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,280
So the poem isn't right about anything!

360
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
God damn you, Hearn!

361
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,560
Everything is wrong!

362
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,000
And the poem is evidence of nothing useful at all!

363
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,520
It's just...

365
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,800
It's been a lot.

366
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,560
So here's the final working theory.

367
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,080
Hearn knew the Conasby family, who either told him of the poem,

368
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,680
or perhaps he spotted it himself, expressed an outsized interest

369
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,960
in their collection of old papers, as he was wont to do.

370
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,720
But either way, when editing his edition of the Scotachronicon,

371
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,680
and it mentioned the family, that triggered his memory,

372
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,520
and he added in his footnote.

373
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,400
Wrong as he saw it, or wrong as he remembered it.

374
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,320
That note in his non-canonical edition, through pure bad luck,

375
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,760
got swept up in the paper-writing-footnote-copy-paste game

376
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,920
where no one checks the original,

377
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,160
and the context that the name Tiffany is not actually in the original book got lost.

378
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,880
At least, now the timeline is complete,

379
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,360
but all this work has shown is that in the 1700s the name Tiffany A&Y existed,

380
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,880
which was not in question at all at the beginning.

381
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,400
For the gods' capricious tormenting pleasure alone,

382
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,200
this path went absolutely nowhere, provided nothing of value,

383
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,960
and drained many hours of my sadly finite life.

384
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:52,840
Uh...

385
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,640
Thanks for listening?

386
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,240
I guess I just really needed to get out all of this frustration

387
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,240
to tell you the story of tracking down a poem that didn't even make it into the main video.

388
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,640
The end.

389
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,280
Hello.

390
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,160
Thank you for making it to not just the end of the video,

391
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,240
but after the end of the video.

392
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,360
Welcome.

393
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,600
Well, that ended up being quite a journey over the past half a year.

394
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,320
Sometimes in making a video, the path through the forest of all knowledge is clearly marked out.

395
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,840
Other times you have something much more difficult to try to get through.

396
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,680
Oh, don't step on the...

397
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:43,960
Whoa!

398
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,160
And occasionally there's almost nothing,

399
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,680
and you're in danger of getting quite lost.

400
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,560
But this is the job.

401
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,040
To turn something that is unmarked into something that's slightly marked.

402
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,040
Perhaps something that's been completed with trusses

403
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,480
to get you over the dangerous and difficult parts.

404
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,440
Some of the videos I make take unreasonably long amounts of time

405
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,080
and unreasonably large amounts of effort.

406
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,040
Things that are frankly not very good business sense

407
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,000
from a YouTube algorithm sort of way,

408
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,760
but I know that as a viewer I love it when people make those sorts of videos.

409
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,640
And I imagine if you're still watching,

410
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,840
you're one of the people who likes those kinds of videos as well.

411
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,720
I've resisted for years coming up with a name for the people who support the channel.

412
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,320
I've never really liked that stuff,

413
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,520
but I've changed my thoughts on that because I realize that they really are part of the team now.

414
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,240
And I know how this is going to sound, but I really mean it.

415
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:02,520
The past six months I have definitely felt very alone at times working on this.

416
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,240
But one of the things that has helped me push on with a crazy project like this

417
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,160
is knowing that there are a lot of people who really care about these videos.

418
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,960
The capricious whims of the YouTube gods cannot be relied upon,

419
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,560
but people willing to back projects directly that they really like?

420
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,600
It means so much.

421
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,080
These videos aren't for everyone, they're for you.

422
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,520
So if you would like to become a Bonnie B and help support the creation of future videos,

423
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,560
which will also get you access to some of the behind the scenes of how the videos are made,

424
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
I just have one requirement first.

425
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,280
You must be financially self-supporting.

426
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,520
So no students in particular.

427
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,360
I want people to work on themselves and work on their own lives before they try to help me out.

428
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,640
I will be fine.

429
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,400
Make sure you're good first.

430
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,160
And I plan on doing this for a long time.

431
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,320
I have been doing this for a long time.

432
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll be here later.

433
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,520
So as long as you're set there, if you would like to join, you can click here.

434
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,280
And thank you so much.

435
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,800
I'll see you in the next video.
