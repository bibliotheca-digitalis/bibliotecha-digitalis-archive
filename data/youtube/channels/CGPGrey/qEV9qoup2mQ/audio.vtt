00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Ta-da! It's a video about Tiffany. I hope you like it.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.240
Psst! Hey, hey, would you like to know more?

00:08.240 --> 00:11.480
Okay, great. So listen, I need to tell you about this poem.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.400
Come with me behind the scenes, where I've been working on this for...

00:15.400 --> 00:18.980
I don't even know how long. Take a seat. Get comfortable.

00:18.980 --> 00:23.540
It all began with these articles I read saying the name Tiffany is very old, maybe medieval.

00:23.540 --> 00:28.200
What a cute and easy video, past Grey thought. And it could have been, it could have been,

00:28.200 --> 00:32.960
if I'd just left things alone. But no, I wanted to read the article's sources,

00:32.960 --> 00:36.200
which turned out didn't often contain the name Tiffany at all,

00:36.200 --> 00:40.960
but rather the ye olden name Theophania, or the super old Theophanu.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.920
And like, maybe these medieval ladies called themselves Tiff,

00:43.920 --> 00:46.680
but that's just a bit too cute, isn't it?

00:46.680 --> 00:50.920
To me, it looked like the sort of Lady Godiva story where later writers say a thing happened,

00:50.920 --> 00:54.760
but there's no evidence from the time that it did, because it's a fairy tale,

00:54.760 --> 00:57.360
the kind history is full of once you go looking.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
Don't go looking.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.240
So for a while, the Tiffany video teared on the edge of getting binned,

01:01.240 --> 01:03.840
but it turned out my Lady Godiva suspicions were wrong

01:03.840 --> 01:06.960
when some medieval Tiffany's did turn up to save the project.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.800
But the poem happened before that, and listen, I need to tell you about it.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.560
Otherwise, I might just explode, trying to contain all the excruciating details

01:16.560 --> 01:19.640
and number of obsessive hours poured into this f-

01:19.640 --> 01:23.840
poem, and I can't let it all have been for nothing.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.800
Okay, ready? No? Too bad. Here's the poem.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.520
Ahem.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.920
William de Conasby came out of Brittany with his wife Tiffany

01:30.920 --> 01:34.040
and his maid Manfass and his dog Hardegrass.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.240
It's okay. That's it.

01:35.240 --> 01:39.360
But what isn't okay is that this poem popped up in modern writings,

01:39.360 --> 01:42.600
implying it's proof that Tiffany is maybe medieval,

01:42.600 --> 01:45.720
but never with the poem's date or an author attached,

01:45.720 --> 01:48.320
making it impossible to pin to a timeline.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.360
Which made the poem annoying.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.200
Doubly so, because it's supposed to be a joke.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.200
Like, here it is in this 1859 history book

01:56.200 --> 01:59.040
with this weird French-style humorous illustration,

01:59.040 --> 02:01.760
but I don't get it. Is it the name of the dog?

02:01.760 --> 02:03.080
What's the joke?

02:03.080 --> 02:05.920
If you get it, please leave a comment. I just, I need to know.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.600
Anyway, when you're reading about a topic,

02:07.600 --> 02:09.600
this is the sort of thing that happens a lot.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.440
There's some detail you keep stumbling over and over,

02:12.440 --> 02:14.360
and it could be the critical clue.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.520
I'm looking for the earliest Tiffany ANY.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.800
There's a Tiffany ANY right here.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.960
Maybe the very first, if I could just pin the poem to its proper place.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.840
But no.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.000
I had just resolved to give up on this poem

02:26.000 --> 02:28.440
when the Tiffany's of America arrived at my door,

02:28.440 --> 02:30.960
which I had ordered weeks ago?

02:30.960 --> 02:33.480
To hopefully help with the main Tiffany video.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.960
But it was just 90% a literal list of people named Tiffany in America,

02:37.960 --> 02:40.400
with hilariously unclear photos.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.480
The book was written by Nelson Otis Tiffany

02:42.480 --> 02:44.240
and thanks Charles Lewis Tiffany

02:44.240 --> 02:48.160
for making the book possible with his liberal contributions of money.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.600
I love how explicit that is.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.840
Then, totally unrelated,

02:50.840 --> 02:53.520
there follows a description of how the Tiffany family crest is.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.400
The most beautiful thing of its kind we have ever seen.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.800
And then two pages of the densest family flattery ever put in print.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.000
But in between those two sections, to mock me,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.720
the poem appeared again.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.200
Without a date, but with a footnote path to follow.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.160
This is the moment I broke

03:11.160 --> 03:14.080
and swore to the gods above and below

03:14.080 --> 03:18.280
I would find the primary source of this Brittany Tiffany poem,

03:18.280 --> 03:21.280
no matter the time, no matter the cost.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.440
And when you give that to the gods,

03:23.440 --> 03:26.400
they, of course, played a joke upon Grey,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.920
making his pursuit of this poem as painful as possible.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.800
Here's what happened.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.040
The Tiffany's of America got the poem from

03:33.040 --> 03:35.360
Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

03:35.360 --> 03:38.880
which I ordered and, when it arrived, found the full title to be

03:38.880 --> 03:40.800
Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

03:40.800 --> 03:43.680
A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary

03:43.680 --> 03:45.400
with Short Notices of Memorable Men.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.320
I opened it and out fell an old map,

03:47.320 --> 03:50.080
which is a thrilling moment, no matter what's mapped on the map,

03:50.080 --> 03:53.360
after checking for spots marked X back to the book to find the poem,

03:53.360 --> 03:56.200
which had a pencil highlight mark and a note below.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.120
It seems whoever owned this book before me

03:58.120 --> 04:00.600
was also on their own poetic Tiffany journey.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.840
Maybe it was Nelson Otis Tiffany, I don't know.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.720
So Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

04:04.720 --> 04:07.120
A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary

04:07.120 --> 04:08.280
with Short Notices of Memorable Men,

04:08.280 --> 04:10.520
lists the poem as from the author M. Thierry.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.720
Now, buying old rare books gets expensive real fast,

04:13.720 --> 04:17.760
so I headed down to my local library to try and track M. Thierry down,

04:17.760 --> 04:19.160
which took a while because,

04:19.160 --> 04:21.240
one, I didn't know then, but I do know now

04:21.240 --> 04:23.440
that M is an old abbreviation for Mr.,

04:23.440 --> 04:26.520
and the author referenced was Mr. Augustine Thierry,

04:26.520 --> 04:30.000
and his book The History of the Conquest of England by the Normans,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.360
and two, my library predates the Dewey Decimal System,

04:33.360 --> 04:35.600
which makes every book search an adventure through

04:35.600 --> 04:38.120
17th century organizational idiosyncrasy,

04:38.120 --> 04:40.360
which is delightful when you're browsing,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.880
but infuriating when you're in the wrong section about England,

04:43.880 --> 04:46.000
and you can't find the book you're looking for

04:46.000 --> 04:48.480
because you should be in the England-only section,

04:48.480 --> 04:50.920
but not here behind the little book elevator.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.600
Anyway, Thierry's book was on the shelf,

04:52.600 --> 04:53.760
I grabbed it, sat down with it,

04:53.760 --> 04:55.640
and flipped through the pages to find the poem.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.400
And that History of the Conquest of England by the Normans

04:58.400 --> 05:00.200
isn't the primary source either,

05:00.200 --> 05:04.360
pointing to Hern, Pradiff, Ad, John, Defordum,

05:04.360 --> 05:06.080
Scotachronicon?

05:06.080 --> 05:10.040
Okay, what's the Scotachronicon?

05:10.040 --> 05:12.880
According to Wikipedia, it's a history book of Scotland,

05:12.880 --> 05:15.520
started in the 1300s by a priest in Aberdeen,

05:15.520 --> 05:17.920
and continued after his death by an abbot in Inchcombe.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.400
These historians worked to cover the history of Scotland

05:20.400 --> 05:23.960
from their present day back to the literal Genesis,

05:23.960 --> 05:26.880
a rather epic undertaking deserving the epic name

05:26.880 --> 05:28.080
the Scotchonomichron.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.760
Fun fact, this book is one of the earliest references to Robin Hood,

05:31.760 --> 05:33.680
though the authors take a rather, hmm,

05:33.680 --> 05:36.960
more dim view of the Hood and his hoi polloi fans

05:36.960 --> 05:38.760
than most modern interpretations.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.400
According to them, then arose the famous murderer Robin Hood

05:42.400 --> 05:44.080
from Among the Disinherited,

05:44.080 --> 05:48.440
whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.400
Interesting, but I didn't come to the library

05:50.400 --> 05:52.600
to track down the earliest reference to Robin Hood.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.320
It's a Piers Plowman poems, by the way.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.040
I'm here to find the Scotchochromicon

05:56.040 --> 06:00.000
in the Scotland History section, which is in the dark.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.240
I'm sure glad my phone has a flashlight.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.640
There it is.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.200
The Scotcheronomicon.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.360
Look at all these handwritten notes.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.000
Last time this was checked out was 1995.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.760
Alas, there was no poem on page 172,

06:15.760 --> 06:18.360
but maybe that page number was for a different edition,

06:18.360 --> 06:22.000
so there was nothing to do but start flipping and skimming,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.600
flipping and skimming, over and over and over and over

06:26.600 --> 06:31.600
and over and over through every single crinkly page

06:31.840 --> 06:35.280
to find the Brittany Tiffany poem nowhere.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.840
Maybe the poem was among those pages and I just missed it.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.040
I mean, the book is in Latin.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.560
It turned out not.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.840
I didn't know it at the time,

06:43.840 --> 06:47.480
but I did have the wrong edition, but in an unexpected way.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.840
This one printed in M-D-C-C-L-I-X,

06:50.840 --> 06:52.520
but if you were to search further,

06:52.520 --> 06:55.360
say at the largest library in the world

06:55.360 --> 06:57.480
with 200 million volumes,

06:57.480 --> 07:02.480
you could find an earlier edition printed in M-D-C-C-X-X-I-I,

07:02.840 --> 07:06.720
which was both much smaller and with hilariously large font

07:06.720 --> 07:08.840
like the author was trying to puff up the book.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.000
But in this one on page 170,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.320
there she was, Brittany Tiffany A-N-Y.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.400
I was thrilled to have found

07:16.400 --> 07:18.920
truly medieval evidence of Tiffany.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.080
I had the primary source.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.560
I could pin the poem to the 1400s,

07:24.560 --> 07:27.240
or so I thought until I remembered

07:27.240 --> 07:29.080
that these guys wrote in Latin

07:29.080 --> 07:32.560
and this poem is in modern-ish English.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.880
How could that be?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.320
Well, it's because this poem

07:35.320 --> 07:37.440
isn't in the Scatronicon at all.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.680
It's a footnote added by the editor of this 1722 edition.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.400
And it's also not the primary source,

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
the editor adding,

07:45.400 --> 07:48.000
in an ancient writing of parchment kept charily

07:48.000 --> 07:50.760
by the family of the Conasby among their records,

07:50.760 --> 07:52.000
they have this written.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.200
Charily, that's an old word that means cautious or warily.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.200
That's weird.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
And ancient?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.360
How ancient?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.000
Fast forward past much time spent

08:01.000 --> 08:03.320
searching Conasby family records without luck.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.360
Though, of course, now that I'm talking about this,

08:05.360 --> 08:07.720
I know some long descendant of the Conasby clan

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
will show up at my door with a reliquary box

08:09.720 --> 08:10.720
in the poem inside,

08:10.720 --> 08:13.120
which I'll need to send off for some radiocarbon dating.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.400
And I also know that every example

08:15.400 --> 08:17.000
of an old Tiffany A-N-Y

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
will be sent to my door forevermore,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.520
but that's future Grey's problem.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.480
For current Grey,

08:21.480 --> 08:23.440
well, now past Grey at the time of writing and research,

08:23.440 --> 08:26.200
the one path the gods had directed before me,

08:26.200 --> 08:28.400
I wish I had not followed through.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.200
Who is Theo Hernias, the editor?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.120
Well, to find out,

08:32.120 --> 08:35.800
step one is to find his non-Latinized name, Thomas Hearn.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.680
Thomas Hearn was, eh, well, we'll get to that,

08:38.680 --> 08:40.720
but he worked at the Bodleian Library at Oxford

08:40.720 --> 08:42.000
in the early 1700s

08:42.000 --> 08:44.240
and published lots of editions of medieval texts,

08:44.240 --> 08:45.640
scotochromicon among them.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.360
Now, trying to find more information

08:47.360 --> 08:50.400
about why someone wrote a footnote 300 years ago

08:50.400 --> 08:51.240
seemed hopeless,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.240
but Google, against all odds,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.880
turned up the collected letters of Alexander Pope,

08:55.880 --> 08:57.840
a contemporary of Hearn's in England

08:57.840 --> 09:02.120
who wrote a 35-page letter about Hearn that begins,

09:18.120 --> 09:19.360
which at first sounds like,

09:19.360 --> 09:20.560
wow, what a fan,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.440
and this 35-page letter by Alexander Pope

09:23.440 --> 09:25.920
happens to mention the Brittany Tiffany poem,

09:25.920 --> 09:28.240
though in a context that seems...

09:28.240 --> 09:28.760
off?

09:28.760 --> 09:30.800
Saying Hearn had so many,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.680
not just historical documents,

09:32.680 --> 09:34.200
but poems in particular,

09:34.200 --> 09:37.040
that it would waste your time to tell you about all of them.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.120
Pope then says Hearn wanted to be useful by saving them all,

09:40.120 --> 09:44.240
but then lists several clearly useful-to-no-one-ever poems,

09:44.240 --> 09:45.640
including Brittany Tiffany.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.120
It's just sort of weird,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.560
and I would've left it at that,

09:48.560 --> 09:49.800
should've left it at that,

09:49.800 --> 09:52.240
but then this passage caught my eye.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.640
We have taken the liberty to correct some

09:54.640 --> 09:56.360
few mistakes in Hearn's writing,

09:56.360 --> 09:59.480
and been careful not to offend any impartial reader.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.520
We have avoided flattery on one hand,

10:01.520 --> 10:03.160
and scandal on the other.

10:03.160 --> 10:03.960
That's a very

10:03.960 --> 10:05.280
I don't love drama

10:05.280 --> 10:06.800
sentence from Pope, isn't it?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.800
I'm just somehow always at the centre of drama.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.360
Oh, this burn book?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.040
It's nothing.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.320
Just where I write down my ideas for plays.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.000
I'm a literal dramatist, you know.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.200
Pope then goes on to fill his 35-page letter with

10:19.200 --> 10:24.000
Nothing but corrections for every mistake Hearn ever made

10:24.000 --> 10:27.040
in all of his work in this infuriating

10:27.040 --> 10:30.040
oh-let-me-just-help-you-out-Hearn kind of way.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.800
Some observations on his writing indeed.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.760
Hearn gets a date wrong, and Pope says

10:34.760 --> 10:35.640
I'm sorry, Hearn.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.880
See here, where you wrote 1274,

10:37.880 --> 10:41.320
you have either not kept up with your avowed regard for truth,

10:41.320 --> 10:44.160
or unhappily blundered in a point of chronology.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.640
You say this man in 1274 studied at Canterbury College,

10:47.640 --> 10:48.640
and he wrote about it,

10:48.640 --> 10:53.080
but I'm afraid to tell you the college was not built until 1363.

10:53.080 --> 10:57.120
Therefore, this man must have either lived 89 years before he was born,

10:57.120 --> 11:00.360
or written of a place many years before it was built.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.360
Oh, Hearn, now don't be annoyed.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.760
These corrections, how much so ever they may look like ridicule,

11:05.760 --> 11:08.680
are undoubted confirmations of your industry,

11:08.680 --> 11:12.480
and will ever be thought so by persons of deeper penetration.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.080
Me? Yow.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.920
Alexander Pope, it turns out,

11:15.960 --> 11:18.200
is the human who coined the phrase

11:20.440 --> 11:23.000
Of course, only after reading the entire letter

11:23.000 --> 11:24.520
did I realize I could have skipped it,

11:24.520 --> 11:28.560
had I first seen Pope hanging out on the bottom of Hearn's Wikipedia page,

11:28.560 --> 11:32.320
calling Hearn's life work unappealing and monkish.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.880
Hearn complained into his diary that Alexander Pope,

11:34.880 --> 11:37.000
one of the most quoted authors in the English language,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.360
just below Shakespeare and the Bible, lacked scholarship.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.760
Alexander Pope, in turn, created a character

11:42.760 --> 11:46.520
for one of his plays based on Hearn named Wormius,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.840
a no-nothing, know-it-all pedant.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.000
Hearn shot back, saying Pope's play was

11:55.080 --> 11:58.360
This delicious beef was the only highlight of my reading,

11:58.360 --> 12:00.320
so I needed to know more.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.840
But putting plus Hearn plus Wormius into Google returned exactly one result,

12:04.840 --> 12:08.040
the Wikipedia page itself, which is super sus.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.160
I mean, does information even exist if it's not on the internet?

12:11.160 --> 12:12.160
Oh right, of course.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.320
So I had to check the listed footnote,

12:14.320 --> 12:16.640
which wasn't at the library, so I ordered the book,

12:16.640 --> 12:19.880
it arrived, I opened it, I read it, and the Hearn-Wormius thing checks out.

12:19.880 --> 12:20.720
Amazing.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.080
But even after that, Alexander Pope just couldn't let it go for some reason,

12:25.080 --> 12:27.120
and after Hearn's death, he wrote,

12:27.120 --> 12:29.680
Hearn was a most sordid, poor wretch.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.600
He had universal mistrust of the generality of mankind,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.200
lived in a slovenly, stingy manner,

12:36.200 --> 12:40.840
and died possessed of what he had not the heart to enjoy.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.040
Alex, jeez!

12:43.040 --> 12:46.920
Uh, so, as you can see, we've traveled down many paths here,

12:46.920 --> 12:51.800
and at this point, I really needed a friend to talk to about this in my life.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.720
The number of people willing to listen for months on end

12:54.720 --> 12:59.520
to updates about not even the very broad topic of the origin of the name Tiffany,

12:59.520 --> 13:00.720
remember, that's where we started,

13:00.720 --> 13:06.320
not even of the exact original source of one poem that mentions the name Tiffany A-N-Y,

13:06.320 --> 13:12.360
but of two dead dudes' schoolboy-level squabbles that are tangentially related to Tiffany,

13:12.360 --> 13:13.800
is zero.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.200
But then there was hope.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.520
I can't even remember how I found it now,

13:17.520 --> 13:21.640
but I came across another Hearn burn via historian John Horace Round

13:21.640 --> 13:25.960
in his Feudal England, Historical Studies on the X-Ith and X-Ith-Ith Centuries,

13:25.960 --> 13:29.080
complaining about Hearn's lack of document date questioning,

13:29.080 --> 13:32.600
ignoring of internal evidence and superficial examinations,

13:32.600 --> 13:37.560
leading to publishing more wrong dates polluting the timeline for everyone.

13:37.560 --> 13:42.440
Oh, and Hearn also got the poem's surname spelling wrong, twice,

13:42.440 --> 13:46.440
which is why nothing turned up for Conisbee family records earlier.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.160
Oof.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.960
At this point, Hearn having cost me so much time,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.480
and feeling so thoroughly alone in the world,

13:51.480 --> 13:55.960
I was excited to find in John Horace Round a friend to phone and complain with over coffee.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.520
As it happens, he even translated part of the Doomsday book,

13:58.520 --> 14:03.320
which was the very first source I checked when starting the Tiffany project so long ago.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.320
We were going to have loads to talk about!

14:05.320 --> 14:07.960
While searching for his digits, I realized, in my excitement,

14:07.960 --> 14:11.080
I had missed the original publication date of his work.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.840
Round had died a hundred years ago, and I was back to being Grey Gnomates.

14:14.840 --> 14:15.800
As usual.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.760
Okay, so look.

14:16.760 --> 14:23.720
This side path I've been carving out to even be able to talk about the Brittany Tiffany poem

14:23.720 --> 14:32.360
is only a tiny, tiny part of all of the explorations that had to happen to make the main Tiffany video.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.880
I've been here alone for, oh gods,

14:35.880 --> 14:41.640
half a year as the only one alive who cares about any of this.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.520
This script is so long now.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.600
Will anyone make it this far?

14:46.600 --> 14:47.640
Is anyone here?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.400
Okay, snap out of it.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.920
Now, in my journeys, I had learned two things about Hearn.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.040
First, his contemporaries referred to him as an antiquarian,

14:58.040 --> 15:01.000
which in my head translated as old-timey for historian,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.560
but was actually old-timey code for hoarder.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.000
Hearn loved collecting every historic document he could find,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.880
but was not very good at sorting them out.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.600
The second thing was that Hearn's edition of the Scottronomicon,

15:12.600 --> 15:15.880
from which all sources pointed back to as the providence of the poem,

15:15.880 --> 15:17.240
is worse than useless,

15:17.240 --> 15:20.360
as not only are his contributions of dubious value,

15:20.360 --> 15:23.240
but he also took it upon himself to cut out a lot,

15:23.240 --> 15:26.920
which explains why his edition was printed in giant font.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.160
This is not considered canonical.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.640
And this should have been the end of it,

15:31.640 --> 15:35.240
but there was still something left to try to pin to the timeline.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.440
Was this Tiffany A.N.Y. a real person?

15:38.440 --> 15:40.040
And when did she live?

15:40.040 --> 15:40.920
Okay, I know.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.120
In retrospect, it seems obvious I should have started here.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.640
Painfully obvious.

15:45.640 --> 15:50.040
But you only know at the end what is the fastest way from the beginning.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.480
Now, surely, I thought,

15:51.480 --> 15:55.560
at least tracking down genealogical records of the family the poem mentioned,

15:55.560 --> 15:57.320
everything would check out.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.440
Right? Wrong.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.760
So, as a reminder, the poem starts with William from Brittany, wife Tiffany.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.720
William Conasby was a real person in the 1300s in England, not Brittany.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.440
And his wife was Beatrice, not Tiffany.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.320
They had a son, Thomas Conasby, who did go to Brittany,

16:13.320 --> 16:15.640
with the Black Prince, who was alive at the time, to battle.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.280
And Thomas, while fighting, became a prisoner of war.

16:18.280 --> 16:23.000
However, his captor agreed to let Thomas go if he would marry his daughter, Tiffany.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.080
Which he did, and it was Thomas who came out of Brittany with his wife, Tiffany.

16:27.080 --> 16:31.560
Except not, because if you look up her paperwork, her name is actually Theophania!

16:31.560 --> 16:33.880
She's only called Tiffany hundreds of years later!

16:33.880 --> 16:36.280
So the poem isn't right about anything!

16:36.280 --> 16:38.040
God damn you, Hearn!

16:38.040 --> 16:39.560
Everything is wrong!

16:39.560 --> 16:43.000
And the poem is evidence of nothing useful at all!

16:44.440 --> 16:45.560
I'm sorry.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.520
It's just...

16:46.520 --> 16:47.800
It's been a lot.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.560
So here's the final working theory.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.080
Hearn knew the Conasby family, who either told him of the poem,

16:53.080 --> 16:56.680
or perhaps he spotted it himself, expressed an outsized interest

16:56.680 --> 16:59.960
in their collection of old papers, as he was wont to do.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.720
But either way, when editing his edition of the Scotachronicon,

17:03.720 --> 17:06.680
and it mentioned the family, that triggered his memory,

17:06.680 --> 17:08.520
and he added in his footnote.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.400
Wrong as he saw it, or wrong as he remembered it.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.320
That note in his non-canonical edition, through pure bad luck,

17:15.320 --> 17:18.760
got swept up in the paper-writing-footnote-copy-paste game

17:18.760 --> 17:20.920
where no one checks the original,

17:20.920 --> 17:27.160
and the context that the name Tiffany is not actually in the original book got lost.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.880
At least, now the timeline is complete,

17:29.880 --> 17:36.360
but all this work has shown is that in the 1700s the name Tiffany A&Y existed,

17:36.360 --> 17:39.880
which was not in question at all at the beginning.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.400
For the gods' capricious tormenting pleasure alone,

17:43.400 --> 17:48.200
this path went absolutely nowhere, provided nothing of value,

17:48.200 --> 17:51.960
and drained many hours of my sadly finite life.

17:52.520 --> 17:52.840
Uh...

17:54.120 --> 17:55.640
Thanks for listening?

17:55.640 --> 17:59.240
I guess I just really needed to get out all of this frustration

17:59.240 --> 18:05.240
to tell you the story of tracking down a poem that didn't even make it into the main video.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.640
The end.

18:11.880 --> 18:12.280
Hello.

18:13.640 --> 18:17.160
Thank you for making it to not just the end of the video,

18:17.160 --> 18:19.240
but after the end of the video.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.360
Welcome.

18:21.160 --> 18:26.600
Well, that ended up being quite a journey over the past half a year.

18:27.160 --> 18:33.320
Sometimes in making a video, the path through the forest of all knowledge is clearly marked out.

18:34.200 --> 18:40.840
Other times you have something much more difficult to try to get through.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.680
Oh, don't step on the...

18:43.640 --> 18:43.960
Whoa!

18:46.040 --> 18:49.160
And occasionally there's almost nothing,

18:50.360 --> 18:54.680
and you're in danger of getting quite lost.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.560
But this is the job.

18:56.440 --> 19:02.040
To turn something that is unmarked into something that's slightly marked.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.040
Perhaps something that's been completed with trusses

19:06.920 --> 19:09.480
to get you over the dangerous and difficult parts.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.440
Some of the videos I make take unreasonably long amounts of time

19:14.440 --> 19:17.080
and unreasonably large amounts of effort.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.040
Things that are frankly not very good business sense

19:22.040 --> 19:25.000
from a YouTube algorithm sort of way,

19:25.000 --> 19:30.760
but I know that as a viewer I love it when people make those sorts of videos.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.640
And I imagine if you're still watching,

19:33.640 --> 19:36.840
you're one of the people who likes those kinds of videos as well.

19:36.840 --> 19:41.720
I've resisted for years coming up with a name for the people who support the channel.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.320
I've never really liked that stuff,

19:43.320 --> 19:48.520
but I've changed my thoughts on that because I realize that they really are part of the team now.

19:49.320 --> 19:53.240
And I know how this is going to sound, but I really mean it.

19:54.120 --> 20:02.520
The past six months I have definitely felt very alone at times working on this.

20:02.520 --> 20:09.240
But one of the things that has helped me push on with a crazy project like this

20:09.240 --> 20:15.160
is knowing that there are a lot of people who really care about these videos.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.960
The capricious whims of the YouTube gods cannot be relied upon,

20:19.960 --> 20:23.560
but people willing to back projects directly that they really like?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.600
It means so much.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.080
These videos aren't for everyone, they're for you.

20:31.960 --> 20:36.520
So if you would like to become a Bonnie B and help support the creation of future videos,

20:36.520 --> 20:41.560
which will also get you access to some of the behind the scenes of how the videos are made,

20:41.560 --> 20:43.960
I just have one requirement first.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.280
You must be financially self-supporting.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.520
So no students in particular.

20:49.400 --> 20:56.360
I want people to work on themselves and work on their own lives before they try to help me out.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.640
I will be fine.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.400
Make sure you're good first.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.160
And I plan on doing this for a long time.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.320
I have been doing this for a long time.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.520
I'll be here later.

21:07.080 --> 21:12.520
So as long as you're set there, if you would like to join, you can click here.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.280
And thank you so much.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.800
I'll see you in the next video.
