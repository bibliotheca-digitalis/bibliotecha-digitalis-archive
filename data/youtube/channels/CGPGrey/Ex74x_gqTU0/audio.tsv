0	3900	Back in the long, long ago, New York and New Jersey fought over the islands betwixt them.
3900	5600	Were they New York or were they New Jersey?
5600	8400	To determine what was whose, New York proposed a race.
8400	12400	All islands that could be encircled in less than 24 hours would belong to New York.
12400	14000	Those not to New Jersey.
14000	18700	Staten Island was the big prize, then described as the most commoditist and richest land.
18700	22700	New Jersey wanted it, and given the island is huge and back-in-the-day boats were slow,
22700	27600	New Jersey thought the island impossible to encircle in under a day, and so it would be hers.
27600	32600	But young New York, determined to expand her empire state, thought she had the man for the job.
32600	34200	Captain Christopher Billup.
34200	38300	The clever captain lashed empty barrels to his ship to help catch the wind and make haste,
38300	41500	and twas this that made the difference, winning the race against time
41500	46500	and encircling the most commoditist island of Staten for New York in just over 23 hours.
46500	51000	This delightful deed earned Billup historical immortality in books and articles and on Wikipedia,
51000	56300	and the embiggen New York gifted the captain an estate, on Staten Island of course, that still stands today.
56300	63000	A historical museum and park for the local Staten Island Yorkers that, were it not for Billup, would find themselves Jerseyites instead.
63000	64600	What a cute story!
64600	69200	So perfect for the video about New York and New Jersey's border disputes I'm working on.
69200	74500	But wait, was the 24-hour race around each island individually, or all islands at once?
74500	75900	This wording isn't clear.
75900	77800	Might as well ask the museum about the route.
77800	81200	I've always found that hometown historians happily honor hometown heroes.
81200	83100	Well, no reason to just sit around.
83100	84400	Let's follow the footnote trail.
84400	86300	New York Times, 1913.
92800	95200	Okay, Billup gets inspired to put the barrels on his ship,
95200	97800	there's great suspense as people await their resident state fate,
97800	101400	and Billup took, quote, a little over 23 hours to complete his journey.
101400	104300	That's less than helpful, and it's a newspaper.
104300	106700	No sources are listed, just the journalist's name.
106700	110600	But she did write a book six years later containing much the same story,
110600	114300	though the onlookers go from suspense to throbbing suspense.
114300	117000	And unlike a newspaper, there is a bibliography.
117000	119500	Yay! But it's not broken down by chapter.
119500	120100	Boo.
120100	121400	I don't really want to go through this.
121400	123200	Please tell me the museum wrote back.
123200	124000	Hmm.
124000	125700	Wait a minute, more than 200 years ago.
125700	127600	The article says almost 300 years ago.
127600	129900	That's nearly 100 years apart.
129900	131400	When did this race even happen?
131400	135900	Almost 300 years ago from 1913 would be 1620-ish,
135900	140600	but New Jersey only became New Jersey in 1664 via a royal charter.
140600	142500	Which, does that thing even mention Billup?
142500	148200	Why do so many organizations put up these tiny, unreadable GIF versions of their founding documents?
148200	151000	Then there's no mention of Billup, or even Staten Island.
151000	153500	So the race had to happen after the charter,
153500	158200	which means it's no more than 249 years before this article.
158200	160500	That's the oldest a source could be.
160500	163700	What's the youngest reliable source that might mention the race?
163700	167400	Well, the Supreme Court dealt with New York and New Jersey island ownership in the 90s.
167400	168600	Does that mention Billup?
168600	171800	Number 120 original, New Jersey against New York.
171800	174300	Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court,
174300	178300	this was a line not only of territory, but of jurisdiction and sovereignty.
178300	182800	So property means jurisdiction, and exclusive jurisdiction doesn't mean exclusive jurisdiction.
182800	183900	Oh.
183900	184400	Well.
184400	191500	Would there have been a clearer way to say governing authority than to use the phrase exclusive jurisdiction?
191500	192500	Oh.
192500	194300	New Jersey, you're getting wrecked.
194300	196200	It's only just begun.
196200	200200	The United States has exclusive jurisdiction over the original three acres of the island.
200200	204600	The exclusive jurisdiction is defined in article three of the compact, or some other meaning of exclusive.
204600	209700	No, we mean the more conventional description of a genuinely exclusive jurisdiction.
209700	211600	I ain't got you any more.
211600	214200	The case is submitted.
214200	215400	What was I doing?
215400	216000	Oh, right.
216000	220200	Nothing about Billup here, but they do mention another 1880s Supreme Court situation,
220200	222600	but that also makes no mention of Billup.
222600	227100	Meanwhile, the museum still hasn't gotten back, and I'm getting suspicious they're avoiding me.
227100	231600	But there is a history section on the site saying the house was built about 1680,
231600	234400	and Christopher Billup was a filthy royal loyal in his home,
234400	238800	the site of a failed peace talk between the righteous revolutionaries and the conquerors crown.
238800	240100	A traitor for the video.
240100	241300	Sweet.
241300	243200	Wait, that's a hundred years apart again.
243200	244900	Oh, damn it, there's two of them.
244900	249800	Captain Christopher Billup, 2Ls, 2Ps, and Colonel Christopher Billup, 2Ls, 1P.
249800	254100	The latter, the great-grandson of the former, both living on Billup Manor, Staten Island.
254100	255800	This has caused much confusion.
255800	262600	But Billup the captain died in 1726, so the race had to happen between 1664 and then.
262600	264000	Okay, I give up.
264000	266400	Let's dive into this.
266400	268000	Nothing is consistent.
268000	272400	Look, look, on Wikipedia and in the New York Times, the race took a little over 23 hours,
272400	277500	but the Staten Islander, 1911, says the race took exactly 23 hours and 37 minutes.
277500	278400	Where did that come from?
278400	282200	And the ship, sometimes she's an Atlantic crossing vessel with cannons
282200	284800	and sometimes she's Billup's personal plucky boat.
284800	288500	Or the manor, in the earliest versions of the story, Billup already lived on the manor,
288500	290900	but in later versions, it was a prize for his victory.
290900	293000	Or the barrels, the barrels.
293000	296600	In A History of Thomas and Anne Billup Farmer and Some of Their Descendants, 1907,
296600	300800	there's this paragraph about the exact location where Billup billowed the barrels,
300800	304300	but that detail is nowhere else ever mentioned just here.
304300	308400	But in the earlier Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island, 1898,
308400	308800	quote,
308800	311600	"...it is said that he covered the deck of his vessels with empty barrels,
311600	313400	thus gaining considerable sailing power."
313400	316500	The it in it is said, a weaselly phrase if there ever was one,
316500	319400	is J.J. Clute, who wrote The Annals of Staten Island 20 years earlier,
319400	321200	telling the tale with no barrels at all.
321200	325400	And Clute starts his history book, saying he spoke to a bunch of old-timers
325400	328700	right before they died and got stories out of them to add to the forest of all knowledge
328700	332800	that otherwise would have been lost, which is a polite way of saying this is oral history,
332800	335100	which is a polite way of saying this is hearsay,
335100	338300	which means this is a hears story, which means this isn't history.
338300	339600	And so it is revealed.
339600	344100	The tale of the race is cute and perfect because it's a Lady Godiva story,
344100	349000	told long after it supposedly happened and survived the centuries by being clever and cute
349000	352600	and evolving to be cleverer and cuterer as it passed along.
352600	354400	It's ye old meme.
354400	356400	Ahhhh.
356400	358900	So much time wasted chasing ghosts.
358900	361900	Time to fix the record and time to let this go.
363800	366000	But... who's Ghost?
366000	367300	Tall tales take tellers.
367300	369300	Who told this story for the first time,
369300	373600	reaching across the centuries to steal hours from my life for the lulz?
374600	377200	Okay, I picked up a trail that predates J.J. Clute.
377200	380800	There's a New York Evening Post article from 1873 with the race,
380800	383400	without the barrels and where Billup already owned the land, by the way,
383400	386100	that lists the prime culprit, Reverend Disaway,
386100	388800	the local chronicler who told the story.
388800	393300	I'm pinning him as the old-timer Clute spoke to for his book that got the story going.
393300	397400	There's references to Disaway writing articles for the Richmond County Gazette
397400	399500	about this race that never happened.
399500	404000	And Staten Island Historical Archives have digitized hundreds of volumes.
404000	408600	But having gone through them all, there's no articles by Disaway.
408600	411200	But there are some missing volumes.
411200	414400	Now, look, I don't want to get all conspiratorial here about
414400	416400	a history museum that never wrote back
416400	419900	or a Staten Island Historical Archive that just so happens to be missing
419900	423400	the couple parts I'm looking for, but I'm in so deep now.
423400	427700	I've tracked down the only place on Earth with surviving physical copies
427700	431400	of the Richmond County Gazette, the New York Public Library,
431400	436400	who just so happens to also list the vital volumes as missing.
436400	437300	But are they really?
437300	442200	Perhaps somewhere in their archive of old and rare books are the missing editions.
442200	445700	But alas, I live thousands of miles away.
445700	448600	The trail ran cold, but I have the culprit's name.
448600	453600	Disaway, 1798 to 1868, is the first tall-tail teller.
453600	456900	But the first written records are lost to history.
456900	458500	Time to let it go.
458500	476500	I couldn't let it go.
476500	479700	I came to the New York Public Library to see for myself that Disaway's
479700	484000	first story about Billup in the Richmond County Gazette really is missing.
488500	498500	Oh, this is it, the last place with answers, the rare book room.
498500	502500	It's really over now.
502500	506500	I tried to talk the librarians into letting me into their rare book script
506500	509500	and to my great surprise, they said no.
509500	511500	Sorry.
511500	515500	But I did get to talk to someone who might just be the world's expert on the Gazette
515500	519500	and confirmed to me quite firmly that the lost volumes really are lost.
519500	522500	So this is it, the end of the footnote trail.
522500	533500	There's nowhere left to go.
533500	536500	While I'm here, might as well go to the Billup Museum and talk to the historians
536500	539500	who never got back to me.
539500	553500	If I ignore my emails, I might just show up.
553500	556500	You've got to be kidding me. They closed it?
556500	560500	I came all this way and they closed it?
560500	566500	Well, at least I know the building is real.
566500	570500	Though when and why it was built isn't exactly nailed down.
570500	575500	And as far as I can know, Captain and Colonel Christopher Billups were real people
575500	578500	connected to the founding and freedom of the country.
578500	582500	And these hooks on reality probably helped Disaway's tale survive over the centuries.
582500	586500	From his mouth to Clute's ear and book, onward to others
586500	591500	and eventually the New York Times to be sourced in the Wikipedia to be found
591500	594500	I wish it had never happened by me.
594500	599500	Even on the southern tip of Staten Island, alone and locked out of Billups' house,
599500	601500	it's really the end of the story.
601500	608500	Nothing else waits on this island for me but ghosts and graves.
608500	612500	Oh, where is it?
612500	621500	I know you're here somewhere.
621500	641500	Oh, it's amazing.
651500	655500	Thank you.
