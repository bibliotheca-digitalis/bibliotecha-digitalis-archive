00:00.000 --> 00:03.900
Back in the long, long ago, New York and New Jersey fought over the islands betwixt them.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.600
Were they New York or were they New Jersey?

00:05.600 --> 00:08.400
To determine what was whose, New York proposed a race.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.400
All islands that could be encircled in less than 24 hours would belong to New York.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.000
Those not to New Jersey.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.700
Staten Island was the big prize, then described as the most commoditist and richest land.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.700
New Jersey wanted it, and given the island is huge and back-in-the-day boats were slow,

00:22.700 --> 00:27.600
New Jersey thought the island impossible to encircle in under a day, and so it would be hers.

00:27.600 --> 00:32.600
But young New York, determined to expand her empire state, thought she had the man for the job.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.200
Captain Christopher Billup.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.300
The clever captain lashed empty barrels to his ship to help catch the wind and make haste,

00:38.300 --> 00:41.500
and twas this that made the difference, winning the race against time

00:41.500 --> 00:46.500
and encircling the most commoditist island of Staten for New York in just over 23 hours.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.000
This delightful deed earned Billup historical immortality in books and articles and on Wikipedia,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.300
and the embiggen New York gifted the captain an estate, on Staten Island of course, that still stands today.

00:56.300 --> 01:03.000
A historical museum and park for the local Staten Island Yorkers that, were it not for Billup, would find themselves Jerseyites instead.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.600
What a cute story!

01:04.600 --> 01:09.200
So perfect for the video about New York and New Jersey's border disputes I'm working on.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.500
But wait, was the 24-hour race around each island individually, or all islands at once?

01:14.500 --> 01:15.900
This wording isn't clear.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.800
Might as well ask the museum about the route.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.200
I've always found that hometown historians happily honor hometown heroes.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.100
Well, no reason to just sit around.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.400
Let's follow the footnote trail.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.300
New York Times, 1913.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.200
Okay, Billup gets inspired to put the barrels on his ship,

01:35.200 --> 01:37.800
there's great suspense as people await their resident state fate,

01:37.800 --> 01:41.400
and Billup took, quote, a little over 23 hours to complete his journey.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.300
That's less than helpful, and it's a newspaper.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.700
No sources are listed, just the journalist's name.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.600
But she did write a book six years later containing much the same story,

01:50.600 --> 01:54.300
though the onlookers go from suspense to throbbing suspense.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.000
And unlike a newspaper, there is a bibliography.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.500
Yay! But it's not broken down by chapter.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.100
Boo.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.400
I don't really want to go through this.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.200
Please tell me the museum wrote back.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.000
Hmm.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.700
Wait a minute, more than 200 years ago.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.600
The article says almost 300 years ago.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.900
That's nearly 100 years apart.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.400
When did this race even happen?

02:11.400 --> 02:15.900
Almost 300 years ago from 1913 would be 1620-ish,

02:15.900 --> 02:20.600
but New Jersey only became New Jersey in 1664 via a royal charter.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.500
Which, does that thing even mention Billup?

02:22.500 --> 02:28.200
Why do so many organizations put up these tiny, unreadable GIF versions of their founding documents?

02:28.200 --> 02:31.000
Then there's no mention of Billup, or even Staten Island.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.500
So the race had to happen after the charter,

02:33.500 --> 02:38.200
which means it's no more than 249 years before this article.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.500
That's the oldest a source could be.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.700
What's the youngest reliable source that might mention the race?

02:43.700 --> 02:47.400
Well, the Supreme Court dealt with New York and New Jersey island ownership in the 90s.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.600
Does that mention Billup?

02:48.600 --> 02:51.800
Number 120 original, New Jersey against New York.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.300
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court,

02:54.300 --> 02:58.300
this was a line not only of territory, but of jurisdiction and sovereignty.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.800
So property means jurisdiction, and exclusive jurisdiction doesn't mean exclusive jurisdiction.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.900
Oh.

03:03.900 --> 03:04.400
Well.

03:04.400 --> 03:11.500
Would there have been a clearer way to say governing authority than to use the phrase exclusive jurisdiction?

03:11.500 --> 03:12.500
Oh.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.300
New Jersey, you're getting wrecked.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.200
It's only just begun.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.200
The United States has exclusive jurisdiction over the original three acres of the island.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.600
The exclusive jurisdiction is defined in article three of the compact, or some other meaning of exclusive.

03:24.600 --> 03:29.700
No, we mean the more conventional description of a genuinely exclusive jurisdiction.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.600
I ain't got you any more.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.200
The case is submitted.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.400
What was I doing?

03:35.400 --> 03:36.000
Oh, right.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.200
Nothing about Billup here, but they do mention another 1880s Supreme Court situation,

03:40.200 --> 03:42.600
but that also makes no mention of Billup.

03:42.600 --> 03:47.100
Meanwhile, the museum still hasn't gotten back, and I'm getting suspicious they're avoiding me.

03:47.100 --> 03:51.600
But there is a history section on the site saying the house was built about 1680,

03:51.600 --> 03:54.400
and Christopher Billup was a filthy royal loyal in his home,

03:54.400 --> 03:58.800
the site of a failed peace talk between the righteous revolutionaries and the conquerors crown.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.100
A traitor for the video.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.300
Sweet.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.200
Wait, that's a hundred years apart again.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.900
Oh, damn it, there's two of them.

04:04.900 --> 04:09.800
Captain Christopher Billup, 2Ls, 2Ps, and Colonel Christopher Billup, 2Ls, 1P.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.100
The latter, the great-grandson of the former, both living on Billup Manor, Staten Island.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.800
This has caused much confusion.

04:15.800 --> 04:22.600
But Billup the captain died in 1726, so the race had to happen between 1664 and then.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.000
Okay, I give up.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.400
Let's dive into this.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.000
Nothing is consistent.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.400
Look, look, on Wikipedia and in the New York Times, the race took a little over 23 hours,

04:32.400 --> 04:37.500
but the Staten Islander, 1911, says the race took exactly 23 hours and 37 minutes.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.400
Where did that come from?

04:38.400 --> 04:42.200
And the ship, sometimes she's an Atlantic crossing vessel with cannons

04:42.200 --> 04:44.800
and sometimes she's Billup's personal plucky boat.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.500
Or the manor, in the earliest versions of the story, Billup already lived on the manor,

04:48.500 --> 04:50.900
but in later versions, it was a prize for his victory.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.000
Or the barrels, the barrels.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.600
In A History of Thomas and Anne Billup Farmer and Some of Their Descendants, 1907,

04:56.600 --> 05:00.800
there's this paragraph about the exact location where Billup billowed the barrels,

05:00.800 --> 05:04.300
but that detail is nowhere else ever mentioned just here.

05:04.300 --> 05:08.400
But in the earlier Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island, 1898,

05:08.400 --> 05:08.800
quote,

05:08.800 --> 05:11.600
"...it is said that he covered the deck of his vessels with empty barrels,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.400
thus gaining considerable sailing power."

05:13.400 --> 05:16.500
The it in it is said, a weaselly phrase if there ever was one,

05:16.500 --> 05:19.400
is J.J. Clute, who wrote The Annals of Staten Island 20 years earlier,

05:19.400 --> 05:21.200
telling the tale with no barrels at all.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.400
And Clute starts his history book, saying he spoke to a bunch of old-timers

05:25.400 --> 05:28.700
right before they died and got stories out of them to add to the forest of all knowledge

05:28.700 --> 05:32.800
that otherwise would have been lost, which is a polite way of saying this is oral history,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.100
which is a polite way of saying this is hearsay,

05:35.100 --> 05:38.300
which means this is a hears story, which means this isn't history.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.600
And so it is revealed.

05:39.600 --> 05:44.100
The tale of the race is cute and perfect because it's a Lady Godiva story,

05:44.100 --> 05:49.000
told long after it supposedly happened and survived the centuries by being clever and cute

05:49.000 --> 05:52.600
and evolving to be cleverer and cuterer as it passed along.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.400
It's ye old meme.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
Ahhhh.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.900
So much time wasted chasing ghosts.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.900
Time to fix the record and time to let this go.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.000
But... who's Ghost?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.300
Tall tales take tellers.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.300
Who told this story for the first time,

06:09.300 --> 06:13.600
reaching across the centuries to steal hours from my life for the lulz?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.200
Okay, I picked up a trail that predates J.J. Clute.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.800
There's a New York Evening Post article from 1873 with the race,

06:20.800 --> 06:23.400
without the barrels and where Billup already owned the land, by the way,

06:23.400 --> 06:26.100
that lists the prime culprit, Reverend Disaway,

06:26.100 --> 06:28.800
the local chronicler who told the story.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.300
I'm pinning him as the old-timer Clute spoke to for his book that got the story going.

06:33.300 --> 06:37.400
There's references to Disaway writing articles for the Richmond County Gazette

06:37.400 --> 06:39.500
about this race that never happened.

06:39.500 --> 06:44.000
And Staten Island Historical Archives have digitized hundreds of volumes.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.600
But having gone through them all, there's no articles by Disaway.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.200
But there are some missing volumes.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.400
Now, look, I don't want to get all conspiratorial here about

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
a history museum that never wrote back

06:56.400 --> 06:59.900
or a Staten Island Historical Archive that just so happens to be missing

06:59.900 --> 07:03.400
the couple parts I'm looking for, but I'm in so deep now.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.700
I've tracked down the only place on Earth with surviving physical copies

07:07.700 --> 07:11.400
of the Richmond County Gazette, the New York Public Library,

07:11.400 --> 07:16.400
who just so happens to also list the vital volumes as missing.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.300
But are they really?

07:17.300 --> 07:22.200
Perhaps somewhere in their archive of old and rare books are the missing editions.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.700
But alas, I live thousands of miles away.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.600
The trail ran cold, but I have the culprit's name.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.600
Disaway, 1798 to 1868, is the first tall-tail teller.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.900
But the first written records are lost to history.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.500
Time to let it go.

07:38.500 --> 07:56.500
I couldn't let it go.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.700
I came to the New York Public Library to see for myself that Disaway's

07:59.700 --> 08:04.000
first story about Billup in the Richmond County Gazette really is missing.

08:08.500 --> 08:18.500
Oh, this is it, the last place with answers, the rare book room.

08:18.500 --> 08:22.500
It's really over now.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.500
I tried to talk the librarians into letting me into their rare book script

08:26.500 --> 08:29.500
and to my great surprise, they said no.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
Sorry.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.500
But I did get to talk to someone who might just be the world's expert on the Gazette

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
and confirmed to me quite firmly that the lost volumes really are lost.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.500
So this is it, the end of the footnote trail.

08:42.500 --> 08:53.500
There's nowhere left to go.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.500
While I'm here, might as well go to the Billup Museum and talk to the historians

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
who never got back to me.

08:59.500 --> 09:13.500
If I ignore my emails, I might just show up.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.500
You've got to be kidding me. They closed it?

09:16.500 --> 09:20.500
I came all this way and they closed it?

09:20.500 --> 09:26.500
Well, at least I know the building is real.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.500
Though when and why it was built isn't exactly nailed down.

09:30.500 --> 09:35.500
And as far as I can know, Captain and Colonel Christopher Billups were real people

09:35.500 --> 09:38.500
connected to the founding and freedom of the country.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.500
And these hooks on reality probably helped Disaway's tale survive over the centuries.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.500
From his mouth to Clute's ear and book, onward to others

09:46.500 --> 09:51.500
and eventually the New York Times to be sourced in the Wikipedia to be found

09:51.500 --> 09:54.500
I wish it had never happened by me.

09:54.500 --> 09:59.500
Even on the southern tip of Staten Island, alone and locked out of Billups' house,

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
it's really the end of the story.

10:01.500 --> 10:08.500
Nothing else waits on this island for me but ghosts and graves.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.500
Oh, where is it?

10:12.500 --> 10:21.500
I know you're here somewhere.

10:21.500 --> 10:41.500
Oh, it's amazing.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.500
Thank you.
