1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Back in the long, long ago, New York and New Jersey fought over the islands betwixt them.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,600
Were they New York or were they New Jersey?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,400
To determine what was whose, New York proposed a race.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,400
All islands that could be encircled in less than 24 hours would belong to New York.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
Those not to New Jersey.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,700
Staten Island was the big prize, then described as the most commoditist and richest land.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,700
New Jersey wanted it, and given the island is huge and back-in-the-day boats were slow,

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,600
New Jersey thought the island impossible to encircle in under a day, and so it would be hers.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,600
But young New York, determined to expand her empire state, thought she had the man for the job.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
Captain Christopher Billup.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,300
The clever captain lashed empty barrels to his ship to help catch the wind and make haste,

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,500
and twas this that made the difference, winning the race against time

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
and encircling the most commoditist island of Staten for New York in just over 23 hours.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
This delightful deed earned Billup historical immortality in books and articles and on Wikipedia,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,300
and the embiggen New York gifted the captain an estate, on Staten Island of course, that still stands today.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:03,000
A historical museum and park for the local Staten Island Yorkers that, were it not for Billup, would find themselves Jerseyites instead.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
What a cute story!

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,200
So perfect for the video about New York and New Jersey's border disputes I'm working on.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,500
But wait, was the 24-hour race around each island individually, or all islands at once?

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,900
This wording isn't clear.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,800
Might as well ask the museum about the route.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,200
I've always found that hometown historians happily honor hometown heroes.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,100
Well, no reason to just sit around.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,400
Let's follow the footnote trail.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,300
New York Times, 1913.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Okay, Billup gets inspired to put the barrels on his ship,

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
there's great suspense as people await their resident state fate,

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,400
and Billup took, quote, a little over 23 hours to complete his journey.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,300
That's less than helpful, and it's a newspaper.

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,700
No sources are listed, just the journalist's name.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,600
But she did write a book six years later containing much the same story,

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,300
though the onlookers go from suspense to throbbing suspense.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,000
And unlike a newspaper, there is a bibliography.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Yay! But it's not broken down by chapter.

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,100
Boo.

36
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,400
I don't really want to go through this.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Please tell me the museum wrote back.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Hmm.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,700
Wait a minute, more than 200 years ago.

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,600
The article says almost 300 years ago.

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,900
That's nearly 100 years apart.

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,400
When did this race even happen?

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,900
Almost 300 years ago from 1913 would be 1620-ish,

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,600
but New Jersey only became New Jersey in 1664 via a royal charter.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,500
Which, does that thing even mention Billup?

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,200
Why do so many organizations put up these tiny, unreadable GIF versions of their founding documents?

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Then there's no mention of Billup, or even Staten Island.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,500
So the race had to happen after the charter,

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,200
which means it's no more than 249 years before this article.

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,500
That's the oldest a source could be.

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,700
What's the youngest reliable source that might mention the race?

52
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,400
Well, the Supreme Court dealt with New York and New Jersey island ownership in the 90s.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Does that mention Billup?

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Number 120 original, New Jersey against New York.

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,300
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court,

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,300
this was a line not only of territory, but of jurisdiction and sovereignty.

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,800
So property means jurisdiction, and exclusive jurisdiction doesn't mean exclusive jurisdiction.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Oh.

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,400
Well.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,500
Would there have been a clearer way to say governing authority than to use the phrase exclusive jurisdiction?

61
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Oh.

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,300
New Jersey, you're getting wrecked.

63
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,200
It's only just begun.

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
The United States has exclusive jurisdiction over the original three acres of the island.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,600
The exclusive jurisdiction is defined in article three of the compact, or some other meaning of exclusive.

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,700
No, we mean the more conventional description of a genuinely exclusive jurisdiction.

67
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,600
I ain't got you any more.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,200
The case is submitted.

69
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
What was I doing?

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, right.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Nothing about Billup here, but they do mention another 1880s Supreme Court situation,

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
but that also makes no mention of Billup.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,100
Meanwhile, the museum still hasn't gotten back, and I'm getting suspicious they're avoiding me.

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,600
But there is a history section on the site saying the house was built about 1680,

75
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,400
and Christopher Billup was a filthy royal loyal in his home,

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,800
the site of a failed peace talk between the righteous revolutionaries and the conquerors crown.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,100
A traitor for the video.

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300
Sweet.

79
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,200
Wait, that's a hundred years apart again.

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,900
Oh, damn it, there's two of them.

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,800
Captain Christopher Billup, 2Ls, 2Ps, and Colonel Christopher Billup, 2Ls, 1P.

82
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,100
The latter, the great-grandson of the former, both living on Billup Manor, Staten Island.

83
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,800
This has caused much confusion.

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,600
But Billup the captain died in 1726, so the race had to happen between 1664 and then.

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, I give up.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's dive into this.

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000
Nothing is consistent.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Look, look, on Wikipedia and in the New York Times, the race took a little over 23 hours,

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,500
but the Staten Islander, 1911, says the race took exactly 23 hours and 37 minutes.

90
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,400
Where did that come from?

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,200
And the ship, sometimes she's an Atlantic crossing vessel with cannons

92
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,800
and sometimes she's Billup's personal plucky boat.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,500
Or the manor, in the earliest versions of the story, Billup already lived on the manor,

94
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,900
but in later versions, it was a prize for his victory.

95
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,000
Or the barrels, the barrels.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,600
In A History of Thomas and Anne Billup Farmer and Some of Their Descendants, 1907,

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,800
there's this paragraph about the exact location where Billup billowed the barrels,

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,300
but that detail is nowhere else ever mentioned just here.

99
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,400
But in the earlier Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island, 1898,

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,800
quote,

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
"...it is said that he covered the deck of his vessels with empty barrels,

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
thus gaining considerable sailing power."

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,500
The it in it is said, a weaselly phrase if there ever was one,

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,400
is J.J. Clute, who wrote The Annals of Staten Island 20 years earlier,

105
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
telling the tale with no barrels at all.

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,400
And Clute starts his history book, saying he spoke to a bunch of old-timers

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,700
right before they died and got stories out of them to add to the forest of all knowledge

108
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,800
that otherwise would have been lost, which is a polite way of saying this is oral history,

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,100
which is a polite way of saying this is hearsay,

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,300
which means this is a hears story, which means this isn't history.

111
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,600
And so it is revealed.

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,100
The tale of the race is cute and perfect because it's a Lady Godiva story,

113
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,000
told long after it supposedly happened and survived the centuries by being clever and cute

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,600
and evolving to be cleverer and cuterer as it passed along.

115
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
It's ye old meme.

116
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Ahhhh.

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,900
So much time wasted chasing ghosts.

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Time to fix the record and time to let this go.

119
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,000
But... who's Ghost?

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,300
Tall tales take tellers.

121
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Who told this story for the first time,

122
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,600
reaching across the centuries to steal hours from my life for the lulz?

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,200
Okay, I picked up a trail that predates J.J. Clute.

124
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,800
There's a New York Evening Post article from 1873 with the race,

125
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,400
without the barrels and where Billup already owned the land, by the way,

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,100
that lists the prime culprit, Reverend Disaway,

127
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,800
the local chronicler who told the story.

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm pinning him as the old-timer Clute spoke to for his book that got the story going.

129
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,400
There's references to Disaway writing articles for the Richmond County Gazette

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,500
about this race that never happened.

131
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,000
And Staten Island Historical Archives have digitized hundreds of volumes.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,600
But having gone through them all, there's no articles by Disaway.

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
But there are some missing volumes.

134
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,400
Now, look, I don't want to get all conspiratorial here about

135
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
a history museum that never wrote back

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,900
or a Staten Island Historical Archive that just so happens to be missing

137
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,400
the couple parts I'm looking for, but I'm in so deep now.

138
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,700
I've tracked down the only place on Earth with surviving physical copies

139
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,400
of the Richmond County Gazette, the New York Public Library,

140
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,400
who just so happens to also list the vital volumes as missing.

141
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,300
But are they really?

142
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,200
Perhaps somewhere in their archive of old and rare books are the missing editions.

143
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,700
But alas, I live thousands of miles away.

144
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,600
The trail ran cold, but I have the culprit's name.

145
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Disaway, 1798 to 1868, is the first tall-tail teller.

146
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,900
But the first written records are lost to history.

147
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,500
Time to let it go.

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I couldn't let it go.

149
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,700
I came to the New York Public Library to see for myself that Disaway's

150
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,000
first story about Billup in the Richmond County Gazette really is missing.

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh, this is it, the last place with answers, the rare book room.

152
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,500
It's really over now.

153
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
I tried to talk the librarians into letting me into their rare book script

154
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
and to my great surprise, they said no.

155
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Sorry.

156
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
But I did get to talk to someone who might just be the world's expert on the Gazette

157
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
and confirmed to me quite firmly that the lost volumes really are lost.

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
So this is it, the end of the footnote trail.

159
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:53,500
There's nowhere left to go.

160
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
While I'm here, might as well go to the Billup Museum and talk to the historians

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
who never got back to me.

162
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:13,500
If I ignore my emails, I might just show up.

163
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You've got to be kidding me. They closed it?

164
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I came all this way and they closed it?

165
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Well, at least I know the building is real.

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Though when and why it was built isn't exactly nailed down.

167
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,500
And as far as I can know, Captain and Colonel Christopher Billups were real people

168
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,500
connected to the founding and freedom of the country.

169
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,500
And these hooks on reality probably helped Disaway's tale survive over the centuries.

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,500
From his mouth to Clute's ear and book, onward to others

171
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
and eventually the New York Times to be sourced in the Wikipedia to be found

172
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
I wish it had never happened by me.

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Even on the southern tip of Staten Island, alone and locked out of Billups' house,

174
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
it's really the end of the story.

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Nothing else waits on this island for me but ghosts and graves.

176
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Oh, where is it?

177
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:21,500
I know you're here somewhere.

178
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Oh, it's amazing.

179
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Thank you.
