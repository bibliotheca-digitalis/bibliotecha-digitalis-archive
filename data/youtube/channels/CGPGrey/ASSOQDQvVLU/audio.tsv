0	3360	The United States is, shockingly, a bunch of states that are united.
3360	7120	It was just 13 to start with, but as time marched on, the border marked west,
7120	11480	bringing us to today and the 48 contiguous states, plus Alaska and Hawaii.
11480	16920	Usually drawn in these little boxes, not to scale, because Hawaii is in the middle of a vast ocean of deadly nothingness,
16920	18840	and Alaska is monstrous.
18840	23720	Unlike other unions, where members can leave if they so choose, statehood is eternal.
23720	25080	Even for you, Texas.
25080	28040	Now, how the federal government works is a story for another time,
28040	31920	but at the moment, all you need know is that Congress, where national laws are written,
31920	34600	is made of representatives sent from the states.
34600	38720	Now, there are some non-state gaps not visible on this map.
38720	41760	The first is Washington, D.C., the nation's capital,
41760	45200	which is a stateless limbo land between Maryland and Virginia.
45200	50200	As D.C. is a city without a state, it puts her under the control of Congress,
50200	54240	meaning that all the other states get the final say on how D.C. is run,
54240	56440	while she doesn't get a vote in anything.
56440	59880	It didn't matter when this District of Columbia was basically uninhabited,
59880	65400	but since more people live in D.C. now than do in a couple of states, it's an uncomfortable arrangement.
65400	70040	The other gaps on this map are the American Indian reservations, which are numerous.
70040	74360	The United States kind of administers them, while sort of treating them as foreign nations,
74360	78040	which means you could draw the state boundaries to look like this,
78040	81400	because the reservations are kind of apart from those states.
81400	86240	But the American Indian reservations are such a full of asterisks, oh-so-sensitive situation,
86240	89120	it's also better as a story for another time.
89120	92720	Gaps aside, the continent and Hawaii is mostly straightforward,
92720	95840	but there's more than just these United States.
95840	98200	When the U.S. ran out of lands to manifest destiny,
98200	101600	she learned from the best and terrified a whole bunch of islands.
101600	105760	First up, Puerto Rico, an organized, unincorporated territory of the U.S.
105760	108160	This means she's self-governing to some extent,
108160	112920	and that all of the U.S. Constitution doesn't automatically apply on the island.
112920	116040	Now, 3.7 million people live in Puerto Rico,
116040	120440	which is 91% of the people living on U.S. territorial islands,
120440	123880	and more people than live in 21 of the states.
123880	128440	And the U.S. treats Puerto Rico as a state in almost all but name,
128440	131080	which possibly soon she will be anyway,
131080	134680	bringing the number of stars to a nice even 51?
134680	137960	But Puerto Rico isn't the only organized, unincorporated territory.
137960	140920	There's also Guam, which was acquired in the Spanish-American War,
140920	143560	along with Puerto Rico, there's the Northern Mariana Islands,
143560	145320	taken from Japan during World War II,
145320	147720	and the U.S. Virgin Islands, taken from nobody.
147720	148840	Denmark sold her.
148840	151800	The people in these territories are American citizens.
151800	154840	In most ways, the territories are just like D.C.
154840	156920	Congress can override their local governments,
156920	160680	and they don't have representation because no state-tation.
160680	162360	But otherwise, it's America.
162360	165800	Actually, the territories in D.C. do get to elect congressional representatives
165800	169400	who attend all of the meetings, but just can't vote in any of them.
169400	173480	Which is either the worst job in the world or the best job in the world,
173480	175720	depending on the kind of person who gets it.
175720	178840	Also, since votes for president are based on state population,
178840	180920	citizens in the territories can't vote.
180920	182680	Which, as mentioned in a previous video,
182680	186600	leads to the weird situation that Americans who live in foreign countries
186600	189320	can vote for president in the state where they last lived,
189320	193560	while Americans who live in America, just in a territory, cannot.
193560	196200	Along with these unincorporated, organized territories,
196280	199800	there are also unincorporated, unorganized territories.
199800	201080	Actually, quite a few.
201080	204200	They are Howland Island, Navissa Island, Wake Island, Jarvis Island,
204200	208120	Johnson Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Reef, Sarnia Bank, and Bajo Nuevo Bank.
208120	211880	Most of these were acquired under the delightfully named Guano Islands Act,
211880	215800	when the U.S. decided she wanted a bunch of islands filled with bird poop.
215800	217800	No, really, the U.S. just straight-up wrote a law
217800	220280	to declare that those islands were now hers.
220280	224440	Unorganized in this system means there's no local government on these islands
224440	226520	because no one lives in these places.
226520	229160	Some of them are barely above the water line.
229160	233080	Now, the weird category is unorganized incorporated territories,
233080	235560	of which there is one, the Palmyra Atoll,
235560	240200	claimed by the U.S. after the totally peaceful annexation of Hawaii.
240200	242840	They're currently an uninhabited nature reserve,
242840	247400	but incorporated means the U.S. Constitution applies here to... who?
247400	251160	The Palmyra Atoll is like that question about a tree falling in the forest.
251160	253880	If there are no people for the Constitution to apply to,
253880	256360	does the Constitution still apply? Yes.
256360	259480	This means if a foreigner gives birth on this uninhabited strip
259480	263960	and doesn't die from the nature, their child would be an American citizen.
263960	265720	Now, this category is empty.
265720	268280	It's where territories go before they become states,
268280	272680	when basically the Constitution fully applies and it was last occupied by Hawaii.
272680	276520	We've gone full circle, but there is one territory we've left out.
276520	280040	American Samoa, home to 55,000 people.
280040	282440	Uniquely, American Samoans don't get to be citizens,
282440	284440	but instead are American nationals.
284440	288040	They can live in the states, but can't vote in presidential elections
288040	291320	unless they go through the immigration process like any foreigner.
291320	295560	Even though, in all other ways, they're indistinguishable from citizens.
295560	299240	This is unique to American Samoa and there seems to be no reason for it,
299240	302920	other than that Congress hasn't gotten around to updating the system.
302920	305560	American Samoa is in the no-government category,
305560	309160	like its Lord of the Flies over there, which it obviously isn't.
309160	312920	So American Samoa, with its organized government, needs to go over here
312920	316040	and Puerto Rico, essentially a state, needs to go over here
316040	318840	and the empty Palmyra Atoll needs to go over here.
318840	323240	But don't hold your breath for the paperwork to make its way through Congress anytime soon.
323240	325240	So that's all the territory of the United States,
325240	327480	but there is one final thing to talk about.
327480	329000	Three tiny nations.
329000	332280	Kaulu, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.
332280	334680	This last has the convenient domain name .fm,
334680	336840	a first choice of quality podcasts everywhere.
336840	337960	Hint, hint, click, click.
337960	340520	These are separate countries with UN seats and everything,
340520	341560	but they have a quote,
341560	344680	compact of free association with the United States.
344680	348520	The deal is that the US provides economic support and military defense
348520	353160	to the compact nations in return for being allowed to build military bases there.
353160	357320	Also, compact citizens can live and work in the United States and vice versa.
357320	360840	Americans wanting to live abroad, you have three easy options.
360840	362040	So that's America.
362040	366200	50 states, many reservations, one district, lots of island territories,
366200	371000	some even with people, and three tiny associated countries.
