00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
The United States is, shockingly, a bunch of states that are united.

00:03.360 --> 00:07.120
It was just 13 to start with, but as time marched on, the border marked west,

00:07.120 --> 00:11.480
bringing us to today and the 48 contiguous states, plus Alaska and Hawaii.

00:11.480 --> 00:16.920
Usually drawn in these little boxes, not to scale, because Hawaii is in the middle of a vast ocean of deadly nothingness,

00:16.920 --> 00:18.840
and Alaska is monstrous.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.720
Unlike other unions, where members can leave if they so choose, statehood is eternal.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.080
Even for you, Texas.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.040
Now, how the federal government works is a story for another time,

00:28.040 --> 00:31.920
but at the moment, all you need know is that Congress, where national laws are written,

00:31.920 --> 00:34.600
is made of representatives sent from the states.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.720
Now, there are some non-state gaps not visible on this map.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.760
The first is Washington, D.C., the nation's capital,

00:41.760 --> 00:45.200
which is a stateless limbo land between Maryland and Virginia.

00:45.200 --> 00:50.200
As D.C. is a city without a state, it puts her under the control of Congress,

00:50.200 --> 00:54.240
meaning that all the other states get the final say on how D.C. is run,

00:54.240 --> 00:56.440
while she doesn't get a vote in anything.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.880
It didn't matter when this District of Columbia was basically uninhabited,

00:59.880 --> 01:05.400
but since more people live in D.C. now than do in a couple of states, it's an uncomfortable arrangement.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.040
The other gaps on this map are the American Indian reservations, which are numerous.

01:10.040 --> 01:14.360
The United States kind of administers them, while sort of treating them as foreign nations,

01:14.360 --> 01:18.040
which means you could draw the state boundaries to look like this,

01:18.040 --> 01:21.400
because the reservations are kind of apart from those states.

01:21.400 --> 01:26.240
But the American Indian reservations are such a full of asterisks, oh-so-sensitive situation,

01:26.240 --> 01:29.120
it's also better as a story for another time.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.720
Gaps aside, the continent and Hawaii is mostly straightforward,

01:32.720 --> 01:35.840
but there's more than just these United States.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.200
When the U.S. ran out of lands to manifest destiny,

01:38.200 --> 01:41.600
she learned from the best and terrified a whole bunch of islands.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.760
First up, Puerto Rico, an organized, unincorporated territory of the U.S.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.160
This means she's self-governing to some extent,

01:48.160 --> 01:52.920
and that all of the U.S. Constitution doesn't automatically apply on the island.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.040
Now, 3.7 million people live in Puerto Rico,

01:56.040 --> 02:00.440
which is 91% of the people living on U.S. territorial islands,

02:00.440 --> 02:03.880
and more people than live in 21 of the states.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.440
And the U.S. treats Puerto Rico as a state in almost all but name,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.080
which possibly soon she will be anyway,

02:11.080 --> 02:14.680
bringing the number of stars to a nice even 51?

02:14.680 --> 02:17.960
But Puerto Rico isn't the only organized, unincorporated territory.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.920
There's also Guam, which was acquired in the Spanish-American War,

02:20.920 --> 02:23.560
along with Puerto Rico, there's the Northern Mariana Islands,

02:23.560 --> 02:25.320
taken from Japan during World War II,

02:25.320 --> 02:27.720
and the U.S. Virgin Islands, taken from nobody.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.840
Denmark sold her.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.800
The people in these territories are American citizens.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.840
In most ways, the territories are just like D.C.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.920
Congress can override their local governments,

02:36.920 --> 02:40.680
and they don't have representation because no state-tation.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.360
But otherwise, it's America.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.800
Actually, the territories in D.C. do get to elect congressional representatives

02:45.800 --> 02:49.400
who attend all of the meetings, but just can't vote in any of them.

02:49.400 --> 02:53.480
Which is either the worst job in the world or the best job in the world,

02:53.480 --> 02:55.720
depending on the kind of person who gets it.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.840
Also, since votes for president are based on state population,

02:58.840 --> 03:00.920
citizens in the territories can't vote.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.680
Which, as mentioned in a previous video,

03:02.680 --> 03:06.600
leads to the weird situation that Americans who live in foreign countries

03:06.600 --> 03:09.320
can vote for president in the state where they last lived,

03:09.320 --> 03:13.560
while Americans who live in America, just in a territory, cannot.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.200
Along with these unincorporated, organized territories,

03:16.280 --> 03:19.800
there are also unincorporated, unorganized territories.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.080
Actually, quite a few.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.200
They are Howland Island, Navissa Island, Wake Island, Jarvis Island,

03:24.200 --> 03:28.120
Johnson Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Reef, Sarnia Bank, and Bajo Nuevo Bank.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.880
Most of these were acquired under the delightfully named Guano Islands Act,

03:31.880 --> 03:35.800
when the U.S. decided she wanted a bunch of islands filled with bird poop.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.800
No, really, the U.S. just straight-up wrote a law

03:37.800 --> 03:40.280
to declare that those islands were now hers.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.440
Unorganized in this system means there's no local government on these islands

03:44.440 --> 03:46.520
because no one lives in these places.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.160
Some of them are barely above the water line.

03:49.160 --> 03:53.080
Now, the weird category is unorganized incorporated territories,

03:53.080 --> 03:55.560
of which there is one, the Palmyra Atoll,

03:55.560 --> 04:00.200
claimed by the U.S. after the totally peaceful annexation of Hawaii.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.840
They're currently an uninhabited nature reserve,

04:02.840 --> 04:07.400
but incorporated means the U.S. Constitution applies here to... who?

04:07.400 --> 04:11.160
The Palmyra Atoll is like that question about a tree falling in the forest.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.880
If there are no people for the Constitution to apply to,

04:13.880 --> 04:16.360
does the Constitution still apply? Yes.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.480
This means if a foreigner gives birth on this uninhabited strip

04:19.480 --> 04:23.960
and doesn't die from the nature, their child would be an American citizen.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.720
Now, this category is empty.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.280
It's where territories go before they become states,

04:28.280 --> 04:32.680
when basically the Constitution fully applies and it was last occupied by Hawaii.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.520
We've gone full circle, but there is one territory we've left out.

04:36.520 --> 04:40.040
American Samoa, home to 55,000 people.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.440
Uniquely, American Samoans don't get to be citizens,

04:42.440 --> 04:44.440
but instead are American nationals.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.040
They can live in the states, but can't vote in presidential elections

04:48.040 --> 04:51.320
unless they go through the immigration process like any foreigner.

04:51.320 --> 04:55.560
Even though, in all other ways, they're indistinguishable from citizens.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.240
This is unique to American Samoa and there seems to be no reason for it,

04:59.240 --> 05:02.920
other than that Congress hasn't gotten around to updating the system.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.560
American Samoa is in the no-government category,

05:05.560 --> 05:09.160
like its Lord of the Flies over there, which it obviously isn't.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.920
So American Samoa, with its organized government, needs to go over here

05:12.920 --> 05:16.040
and Puerto Rico, essentially a state, needs to go over here

05:16.040 --> 05:18.840
and the empty Palmyra Atoll needs to go over here.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.240
But don't hold your breath for the paperwork to make its way through Congress anytime soon.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.240
So that's all the territory of the United States,

05:25.240 --> 05:27.480
but there is one final thing to talk about.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.000
Three tiny nations.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.280
Kaulu, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.680
This last has the convenient domain name .fm,

05:34.680 --> 05:36.840
a first choice of quality podcasts everywhere.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.960
Hint, hint, click, click.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.520
These are separate countries with UN seats and everything,

05:40.520 --> 05:41.560
but they have a quote,

05:41.560 --> 05:44.680
compact of free association with the United States.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.520
The deal is that the US provides economic support and military defense

05:48.520 --> 05:53.160
to the compact nations in return for being allowed to build military bases there.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.320
Also, compact citizens can live and work in the United States and vice versa.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.840
Americans wanting to live abroad, you have three easy options.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.040
So that's America.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.200
50 states, many reservations, one district, lots of island territories,

06:06.200 --> 06:11.000
some even with people, and three tiny associated countries.
