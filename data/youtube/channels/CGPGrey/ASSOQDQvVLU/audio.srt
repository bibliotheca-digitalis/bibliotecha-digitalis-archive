1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
The United States is, shockingly, a bunch of states that are united.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
It was just 13 to start with, but as time marched on, the border marked west,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,480
bringing us to today and the 48 contiguous states, plus Alaska and Hawaii.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,920
Usually drawn in these little boxes, not to scale, because Hawaii is in the middle of a vast ocean of deadly nothingness,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,840
and Alaska is monstrous.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,720
Unlike other unions, where members can leave if they so choose, statehood is eternal.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,080
Even for you, Texas.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,040
Now, how the federal government works is a story for another time,

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,920
but at the moment, all you need know is that Congress, where national laws are written,

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,600
is made of representatives sent from the states.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,720
Now, there are some non-state gaps not visible on this map.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,760
The first is Washington, D.C., the nation's capital,

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,200
which is a stateless limbo land between Maryland and Virginia.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,200
As D.C. is a city without a state, it puts her under the control of Congress,

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,240
meaning that all the other states get the final say on how D.C. is run,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,440
while she doesn't get a vote in anything.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,880
It didn't matter when this District of Columbia was basically uninhabited,

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,400
but since more people live in D.C. now than do in a couple of states, it's an uncomfortable arrangement.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,040
The other gaps on this map are the American Indian reservations, which are numerous.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,360
The United States kind of administers them, while sort of treating them as foreign nations,

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,040
which means you could draw the state boundaries to look like this,

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,400
because the reservations are kind of apart from those states.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,240
But the American Indian reservations are such a full of asterisks, oh-so-sensitive situation,

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,120
it's also better as a story for another time.

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,720
Gaps aside, the continent and Hawaii is mostly straightforward,

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
but there's more than just these United States.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,200
When the U.S. ran out of lands to manifest destiny,

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,600
she learned from the best and terrified a whole bunch of islands.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,760
First up, Puerto Rico, an organized, unincorporated territory of the U.S.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,160
This means she's self-governing to some extent,

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,920
and that all of the U.S. Constitution doesn't automatically apply on the island.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,040
Now, 3.7 million people live in Puerto Rico,

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,440
which is 91% of the people living on U.S. territorial islands,

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,880
and more people than live in 21 of the states.

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,440
And the U.S. treats Puerto Rico as a state in almost all but name,

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,080
which possibly soon she will be anyway,

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,680
bringing the number of stars to a nice even 51?

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,960
But Puerto Rico isn't the only organized, unincorporated territory.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,920
There's also Guam, which was acquired in the Spanish-American War,

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,560
along with Puerto Rico, there's the Northern Mariana Islands,

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,320
taken from Japan during World War II,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,720
and the U.S. Virgin Islands, taken from nobody.

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,840
Denmark sold her.

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,800
The people in these territories are American citizens.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
In most ways, the territories are just like D.C.

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,920
Congress can override their local governments,

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,680
and they don't have representation because no state-tation.

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,360
But otherwise, it's America.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,800
Actually, the territories in D.C. do get to elect congressional representatives

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,400
who attend all of the meetings, but just can't vote in any of them.

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
Which is either the worst job in the world or the best job in the world,

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,720
depending on the kind of person who gets it.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,840
Also, since votes for president are based on state population,

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,920
citizens in the territories can't vote.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,680
Which, as mentioned in a previous video,

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,600
leads to the weird situation that Americans who live in foreign countries

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,320
can vote for president in the state where they last lived,

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,560
while Americans who live in America, just in a territory, cannot.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,200
Along with these unincorporated, organized territories,

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,800
there are also unincorporated, unorganized territories.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Actually, quite a few.

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,200
They are Howland Island, Navissa Island, Wake Island, Jarvis Island,

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,120
Johnson Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Reef, Sarnia Bank, and Bajo Nuevo Bank.

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Most of these were acquired under the delightfully named Guano Islands Act,

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,800
when the U.S. decided she wanted a bunch of islands filled with bird poop.

66
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
No, really, the U.S. just straight-up wrote a law

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,280
to declare that those islands were now hers.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,440
Unorganized in this system means there's no local government on these islands

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
because no one lives in these places.

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,160
Some of them are barely above the water line.

71
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,080
Now, the weird category is unorganized incorporated territories,

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,560
of which there is one, the Palmyra Atoll,

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,200
claimed by the U.S. after the totally peaceful annexation of Hawaii.

74
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,840
They're currently an uninhabited nature reserve,

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,400
but incorporated means the U.S. Constitution applies here to... who?

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,160
The Palmyra Atoll is like that question about a tree falling in the forest.

77
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,880
If there are no people for the Constitution to apply to,

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,360
does the Constitution still apply? Yes.

79
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,480
This means if a foreigner gives birth on this uninhabited strip

80
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,960
and doesn't die from the nature, their child would be an American citizen.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,720
Now, this category is empty.

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,280
It's where territories go before they become states,

83
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,680
when basically the Constitution fully applies and it was last occupied by Hawaii.

84
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,520
We've gone full circle, but there is one territory we've left out.

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,040
American Samoa, home to 55,000 people.

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,440
Uniquely, American Samoans don't get to be citizens,

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
but instead are American nationals.

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,040
They can live in the states, but can't vote in presidential elections

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,320
unless they go through the immigration process like any foreigner.

90
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,560
Even though, in all other ways, they're indistinguishable from citizens.

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,240
This is unique to American Samoa and there seems to be no reason for it,

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,920
other than that Congress hasn't gotten around to updating the system.

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,560
American Samoa is in the no-government category,

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,160
like its Lord of the Flies over there, which it obviously isn't.

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,920
So American Samoa, with its organized government, needs to go over here

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,040
and Puerto Rico, essentially a state, needs to go over here

97
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,840
and the empty Palmyra Atoll needs to go over here.

98
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,240
But don't hold your breath for the paperwork to make its way through Congress anytime soon.

99
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
So that's all the territory of the United States,

100
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,480
but there is one final thing to talk about.

101
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,000
Three tiny nations.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,280
Kaulu, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,680
This last has the convenient domain name .fm,

104
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
a first choice of quality podcasts everywhere.

105
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Hint, hint, click, click.

106
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,520
These are separate countries with UN seats and everything,

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
but they have a quote,

108
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,680
compact of free association with the United States.

109
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,520
The deal is that the US provides economic support and military defense

110
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,160
to the compact nations in return for being allowed to build military bases there.

111
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,320
Also, compact citizens can live and work in the United States and vice versa.

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,840
Americans wanting to live abroad, you have three easy options.

113
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
So that's America.

114
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,200
50 states, many reservations, one district, lots of island territories,

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,000
some even with people, and three tiny associated countries.
