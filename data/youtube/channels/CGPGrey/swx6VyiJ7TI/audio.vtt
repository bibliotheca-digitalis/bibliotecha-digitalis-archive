For security reasons, baggage left unattended will be removed and destroyed.

00:28.000 --> 00:52.000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
United Airlines flight 2121 to Denver.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed.

01:58.000 --> 02:08.000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

02:28.000 --> 02:38.000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed.

03:18.000 --> 03:31.000
That is what happens when a mother plant tumbles in the wind and then the farmer sprays and all of the progeny from this mother plant carry a resistance gene.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
Let me just make sure I understand. If the farmer had not sprayed, there would be tumbleweed all over this photo, right?

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
So what I'm seeing is the one plant that developed a resistance that survived the spraying.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
If the farmer had not sprayed, the whole field would have looked green. Let's just do a walking tour of the facility.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Oh, by the way, before I forget, that coffee was fantastic.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Was it?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, that was great.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh yeah.

03:54.000 --> 04:07.000
On the tour, I was able to see my first tumble tots in person and the various tortures weeds are put through at the lab to test their strengths and weaknesses in a variety of ways, particularly cold tolerance that I've got to experience firsthand.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Whoa, it's cold.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And it's crazy how tough weeds can be and how fast they can adapt.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Here's an example where two weeds of the same species were sprayed with weed killer.

04:16.000 --> 04:30.000
The one on the left looks like it's doing better, but that's the one that's going to die because the weed on the right has a new mutation that lets it push all the weed killer into its outmost leaves to sacrifice them so the core can survive.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
This video was taken just before I arrived, so I got to see the survivor in person.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So this is the one that got sprayed.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And it totally survived.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
This is a gratitude.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Right.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
He is susceptible and he's resistant.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Okay, those are susceptible and those are the resistant ones.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Now these are beautiful because he's normal grow.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Right, so they all have these little cores that survived.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And just the outside parts died.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
God, that's nuts though that this is the one you showed me that got love that I thought was doomed.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I thought this was totally doomed and it's growing all up to be a big problem.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And the tumbleweeds in particular are insanely adaptive.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
Talking to the experts all day about the terror of tumbleweed and their seemingly endless ways to survive,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I wanted to know, why is it that some weeds are so much better at being weeds?

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
It was about the genome and just what it is that is fascinating about it.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
So, you know, genetic variation is the source of what natural selection acts on

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
and that's what enables species to respond to changes in climate over time.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Imagine that area around Salt Lake where you are and the harshest environments on the planet, right?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And yet tumbleweeds are thriving there.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't know if you've seen one of these videos where they make a media plate that contains different antibiotics in series

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
and you put the bacteria to start and a mutation will happen for resistance and they'll grow.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Then they hit the next one, a mutation happens and they grow and so on.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Because bacteria divide every 15, 20 minutes, you know, it's happening so much faster.

06:04.000 --> 06:13.000
So we're kind of asking maybe why one species is a better weed than another one is that maybe they have a higher rate of generating all these sources of variation.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
And so extra copies, mutations in those copies.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
So that's what it is. It's not just that the weed has a gene which can metabolize a herbicide.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
It's that that weed has 50 copies of the same gene, which means the plant has all of these places in which mutations can possibly occur

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
that benefited for processing like the different version of the herbicide.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
And allowed to survive.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
While still being able to keep all of the copies for the old version of the herbicide.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So it doesn't have to just like mutate that one gene in the exact correct way.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh wow, what a pain in the ass.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
Our working hypothesis right now is that kochia has a genome that is more prone to mistakes that generate gene duplications than other species.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
And that could just be really beneficial, especially for something that is invading a new place.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
What makes the difference between just dying off and going extinct versus propagating across a continent?

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Maybe their air repair machinery has lower fidelity.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And this generates variation that can be adaptive.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
And then where it gets even a bit more provocative is does it respond to stress?

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
Is that a signal to the plant to relax its air repair mechanisms and actually generate more novel genetic variations?

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
We don't really know that you get adaptive variation from stress in the plant.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
We'd like to test it and find out.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
You say it's the provocative one, but I feel like I'm totally convinced by you.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
I'm listening to you talk, I'm sitting here going, oh how could that not be true?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Like, that'd be so advantageous.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We too cool.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
So if we can't beat them, the question is, can we turn tumbleweed to our advantage?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Because we've done the full genome sequence, or kochia,

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
we want to explore the genes in these successful, long-lasting weeds

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
and see if there are traits that we can take out of the weeds

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
and use them to improve soybeans or corn or cotton or whatever.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
If you had to pick the four things that I would pull out of a plant like kochia,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
so they're cold tolerant, they're extremely heat tolerant,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
they're also very drought tolerant, it tolerates saline soils, so salty soils.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
So if you could put those four traits together and introduce them into crop genomes,

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
at the global level, I'm telling you, it would be worth billions and billions and billions of dollars.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Looking at weeds as more than just something to kill and control and manage,

08:36.000 --> 08:44.000
but as a novel source of unique genes that could be beneficial for food and fuel production at a global level.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, the day is ending here, and it has totally been worth crossing the ocean for.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
My brain is completely full of tumbleweed talk, thanks to the team at the Colorado State Weed Lab.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
But I am exhausted. I've stayed on GMT, so it's much later for me here than it normally would be.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
So I need to get back to the hotel to sleep and to process everything,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
to get up tomorrow morning to drive to the airports and to fly back home,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
to make some adjustments to the script based on all of the conversations here,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
so that future me can finish making that video.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I think it's going to be a good one. I'm really excited.

09:26.000 --> 09:47.000
For something like this, is a person manually putting each seat in one at a time? Holy moly.
