198000	211000	That is what happens when a mother plant tumbles in the wind and then the farmer sprays and all of the progeny from this mother plant carry a resistance gene.
211000	217000	Let me just make sure I understand. If the farmer had not sprayed, there would be tumbleweed all over this photo, right?
217000	223000	So what I'm seeing is the one plant that developed a resistance that survived the spraying.
224000	228000	If the farmer had not sprayed, the whole field would have looked green. Let's just do a walking tour of the facility.
228000	231000	Oh, by the way, before I forget, that coffee was fantastic.
231000	232000	Was it?
232000	233000	Yeah, that was great.
233000	234000	Oh yeah.
234000	247000	On the tour, I was able to see my first tumble tots in person and the various tortures weeds are put through at the lab to test their strengths and weaknesses in a variety of ways, particularly cold tolerance that I've got to experience firsthand.
247000	249000	Whoa, it's cold.
249000	252000	And it's crazy how tough weeds can be and how fast they can adapt.
252000	256000	Here's an example where two weeds of the same species were sprayed with weed killer.
256000	270000	The one on the left looks like it's doing better, but that's the one that's going to die because the weed on the right has a new mutation that lets it push all the weed killer into its outmost leaves to sacrifice them so the core can survive.
270000	275000	This video was taken just before I arrived, so I got to see the survivor in person.
275000	277000	So this is the one that got sprayed.
277000	278000	Yeah.
278000	280000	And it totally survived.
280000	281000	This is a gratitude.
281000	282000	Right.
282000	285000	He is susceptible and he's resistant.
285000	287000	Okay, those are susceptible and those are the resistant ones.
287000	288000	Yeah.
288000	292000	Now these are beautiful because he's normal grow.
292000	293000	Yeah.
293000	296000	Right, so they all have these little cores that survived.
296000	297000	Yeah.
297000	299000	And just the outside parts died.
299000	300000	Yeah.
300000	304000	God, that's nuts though that this is the one you showed me that got love that I thought was doomed.
304000	309000	I thought this was totally doomed and it's growing all up to be a big problem.
309000	312000	And the tumbleweeds in particular are insanely adaptive.
312000	318000	Talking to the experts all day about the terror of tumbleweed and their seemingly endless ways to survive,
318000	322000	I wanted to know, why is it that some weeds are so much better at being weeds?
322000	327000	It was about the genome and just what it is that is fascinating about it.
327000	332000	So, you know, genetic variation is the source of what natural selection acts on
332000	336000	and that's what enables species to respond to changes in climate over time.
336000	341000	Imagine that area around Salt Lake where you are and the harshest environments on the planet, right?
341000	344000	And yet tumbleweeds are thriving there.
344000	351000	I don't know if you've seen one of these videos where they make a media plate that contains different antibiotics in series
351000	355000	and you put the bacteria to start and a mutation will happen for resistance and they'll grow.
355000	360000	Then they hit the next one, a mutation happens and they grow and so on.
360000	364000	Because bacteria divide every 15, 20 minutes, you know, it's happening so much faster.
364000	373000	So we're kind of asking maybe why one species is a better weed than another one is that maybe they have a higher rate of generating all these sources of variation.
373000	376000	And so extra copies, mutations in those copies.
376000	382000	So that's what it is. It's not just that the weed has a gene which can metabolize a herbicide.
382000	391000	It's that that weed has 50 copies of the same gene, which means the plant has all of these places in which mutations can possibly occur
391000	394000	that benefited for processing like the different version of the herbicide.
394000	395000	And allowed to survive.
395000	401000	While still being able to keep all of the copies for the old version of the herbicide.
401000	405000	So it doesn't have to just like mutate that one gene in the exact correct way.
405000	407000	Oh wow, what a pain in the ass.
407000	409000	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
409000	417000	Our working hypothesis right now is that kochia has a genome that is more prone to mistakes that generate gene duplications than other species.
417000	424000	And that could just be really beneficial, especially for something that is invading a new place.
424000	429000	What makes the difference between just dying off and going extinct versus propagating across a continent?
429000	433000	Maybe their air repair machinery has lower fidelity.
433000	436000	And this generates variation that can be adaptive.
436000	440000	And then where it gets even a bit more provocative is does it respond to stress?
440000	448000	Is that a signal to the plant to relax its air repair mechanisms and actually generate more novel genetic variations?
448000	452000	We don't really know that you get adaptive variation from stress in the plant.
452000	454000	We'd like to test it and find out.
454000	458000	You say it's the provocative one, but I feel like I'm totally convinced by you.
458000	462000	I'm listening to you talk, I'm sitting here going, oh how could that not be true?
462000	464000	Like, that'd be so advantageous.
464000	466000	We too cool.
466000	467000	Yeah.
468000	472000	So if we can't beat them, the question is, can we turn tumbleweed to our advantage?
472000	475000	Because we've done the full genome sequence, or kochia,
475000	481000	we want to explore the genes in these successful, long-lasting weeds
481000	484000	and see if there are traits that we can take out of the weeds
484000	488000	and use them to improve soybeans or corn or cotton or whatever.
488000	492000	If you had to pick the four things that I would pull out of a plant like kochia,
492000	495000	so they're cold tolerant, they're extremely heat tolerant,
495000	500000	they're also very drought tolerant, it tolerates saline soils, so salty soils.
500000	505000	So if you could put those four traits together and introduce them into crop genomes,
505000	511000	at the global level, I'm telling you, it would be worth billions and billions and billions of dollars.
511000	516000	Looking at weeds as more than just something to kill and control and manage,
516000	524000	but as a novel source of unique genes that could be beneficial for food and fuel production at a global level.
525000	532000	Well, the day is ending here, and it has totally been worth crossing the ocean for.
532000	540000	My brain is completely full of tumbleweed talk, thanks to the team at the Colorado State Weed Lab.
540000	546000	But I am exhausted. I've stayed on GMT, so it's much later for me here than it normally would be.
546000	552000	So I need to get back to the hotel to sleep and to process everything,
552000	556000	to get up tomorrow morning to drive to the airports and to fly back home,
556000	560000	to make some adjustments to the script based on all of the conversations here,
560000	563000	so that future me can finish making that video.
563000	566000	I think it's going to be a good one. I'm really excited.
566000	587000	For something like this, is a person manually putting each seat in one at a time? Holy moly.
