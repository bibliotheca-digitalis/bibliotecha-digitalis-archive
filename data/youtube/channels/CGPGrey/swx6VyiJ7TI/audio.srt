1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For security reasons, baggage left unattended will be removed and destroyed.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
United Airlines flight 2121 to Denver.

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed and destroyed.

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
For security reasons, baggage left untended will be removed.

9
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That is what happens when a mother plant tumbles in the wind and then the farmer sprays and all of the progeny from this mother plant carry a resistance gene.

10
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let me just make sure I understand. If the farmer had not sprayed, there would be tumbleweed all over this photo, right?

11
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So what I'm seeing is the one plant that developed a resistance that survived the spraying.

12
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If the farmer had not sprayed, the whole field would have looked green. Let's just do a walking tour of the facility.

13
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, by the way, before I forget, that coffee was fantastic.

14
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Was it?

15
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, that was great.

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh yeah.

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:07,000
On the tour, I was able to see my first tumble tots in person and the various tortures weeds are put through at the lab to test their strengths and weaknesses in a variety of ways, particularly cold tolerance that I've got to experience firsthand.

18
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Whoa, it's cold.

19
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And it's crazy how tough weeds can be and how fast they can adapt.

20
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Here's an example where two weeds of the same species were sprayed with weed killer.

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The one on the left looks like it's doing better, but that's the one that's going to die because the weed on the right has a new mutation that lets it push all the weed killer into its outmost leaves to sacrifice them so the core can survive.

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This video was taken just before I arrived, so I got to see the survivor in person.

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So this is the one that got sprayed.

24
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And it totally survived.

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is a gratitude.

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Right.

28
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He is susceptible and he's resistant.

29
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay, those are susceptible and those are the resistant ones.

30
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

31
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now these are beautiful because he's normal grow.

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

33
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Right, so they all have these little cores that survived.

34
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And just the outside parts died.

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
God, that's nuts though that this is the one you showed me that got love that I thought was doomed.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I thought this was totally doomed and it's growing all up to be a big problem.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And the tumbleweeds in particular are insanely adaptive.

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Talking to the experts all day about the terror of tumbleweed and their seemingly endless ways to survive,

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I wanted to know, why is it that some weeds are so much better at being weeds?

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was about the genome and just what it is that is fascinating about it.

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, you know, genetic variation is the source of what natural selection acts on

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and that's what enables species to respond to changes in climate over time.

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Imagine that area around Salt Lake where you are and the harshest environments on the planet, right?

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And yet tumbleweeds are thriving there.

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know if you've seen one of these videos where they make a media plate that contains different antibiotics in series

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and you put the bacteria to start and a mutation will happen for resistance and they'll grow.

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then they hit the next one, a mutation happens and they grow and so on.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because bacteria divide every 15, 20 minutes, you know, it's happening so much faster.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So we're kind of asking maybe why one species is a better weed than another one is that maybe they have a higher rate of generating all these sources of variation.

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so extra copies, mutations in those copies.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that's what it is. It's not just that the weed has a gene which can metabolize a herbicide.

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's that that weed has 50 copies of the same gene, which means the plant has all of these places in which mutations can possibly occur

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
that benefited for processing like the different version of the herbicide.

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And allowed to survive.

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
While still being able to keep all of the copies for the old version of the herbicide.

58
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it doesn't have to just like mutate that one gene in the exact correct way.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh wow, what a pain in the ass.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Our working hypothesis right now is that kochia has a genome that is more prone to mistakes that generate gene duplications than other species.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And that could just be really beneficial, especially for something that is invading a new place.

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What makes the difference between just dying off and going extinct versus propagating across a continent?

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Maybe their air repair machinery has lower fidelity.

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And this generates variation that can be adaptive.

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then where it gets even a bit more provocative is does it respond to stress?

67
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is that a signal to the plant to relax its air repair mechanisms and actually generate more novel genetic variations?

68
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We don't really know that you get adaptive variation from stress in the plant.

69
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We'd like to test it and find out.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You say it's the provocative one, but I feel like I'm totally convinced by you.

71
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm listening to you talk, I'm sitting here going, oh how could that not be true?

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Like, that'd be so advantageous.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We too cool.

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So if we can't beat them, the question is, can we turn tumbleweed to our advantage?

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because we've done the full genome sequence, or kochia,

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
we want to explore the genes in these successful, long-lasting weeds

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and see if there are traits that we can take out of the weeds

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and use them to improve soybeans or corn or cotton or whatever.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If you had to pick the four things that I would pull out of a plant like kochia,

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
so they're cold tolerant, they're extremely heat tolerant,

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
they're also very drought tolerant, it tolerates saline soils, so salty soils.

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So if you could put those four traits together and introduce them into crop genomes,

84
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
at the global level, I'm telling you, it would be worth billions and billions and billions of dollars.

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Looking at weeds as more than just something to kill and control and manage,

86
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but as a novel source of unique genes that could be beneficial for food and fuel production at a global level.

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, the day is ending here, and it has totally been worth crossing the ocean for.

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My brain is completely full of tumbleweed talk, thanks to the team at the Colorado State Weed Lab.

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But I am exhausted. I've stayed on GMT, so it's much later for me here than it normally would be.

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I need to get back to the hotel to sleep and to process everything,

91
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to get up tomorrow morning to drive to the airports and to fly back home,

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to make some adjustments to the script based on all of the conversations here,

93
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
so that future me can finish making that video.

94
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think it's going to be a good one. I'm really excited.

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:47,000
For something like this, is a person manually putting each seat in one at a time? Holy moly.
