1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
The Interstate Highway shields hide within them long-forgotten knowledge.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,760
As our great ancestors could navigate by the signs in the sky before the creation of the compass,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,160
so too before GPS could they navigate by these signs.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,280
Come with me and learn how to navigate the constellations created across a continent by

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,960
the Interstate Highway System.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,400
First are the Interstate Majors, beginning with I-90 from Seattle to Boston,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,440
the longest and northernest of all the I's.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,760
Then the southernest, Jacksonville, Florida to Santa Monica, California, I-10.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,320
Interstate Majors that run east-west are double digits ending in zero,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,720
the bigger the northerner, so filling in the rest,

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,720
the next northernest is San Francisco, California to Teaneck, New Jersey, I-80,

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,120
and the next southernest, Florence, South Carolina to Kent, Texas, I-20.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
Then Co-Fort Utah to Baltimore, Maryland, I-70,

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,560
and Little Rock, Arkansas to Fort Worth, Texas, I-30.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,120
Okay, so that one is the most minor of the Majors,

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,920
and it doesn't quite fit as well with the rest, with its diagonality.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,280
But I'm confident it's the lone exception and not foreshadowing.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,440
Next Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina, I-40,

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,520
then I-50 and I-60, which don't exist.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,560
See, there are older highways than the Interstate System,

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,920
slower otherways not built to the Interstate's Book of Exalted Construction Codes.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,000
These are called US Highways or US Routes, the most famous of which is Route 66,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
and these use the United States Numbered Highway System,

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
which put the old US Route 50 and 60 right in the middle.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
The Department of Transportation knew that only the most devout roadway anoraks

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
would be attuned to the difference between Interstates and Routes,

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
and normals would simply look at the number.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
To simplify everyone's life,

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
DOT skipped Interstates 50 and 60 to avoid mines getting muddled in the middle of America.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,120
That's the East-West Interstate Majors' coverage.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Now on to North-South, the longest of which is Maine to Miami, Florida, I-95,

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,200
which, like all Majors, no exception surely, are double digits,

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
but ending in 5 now to indicate verticality.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,760
On the opposite coast, San Diego, California to Blaine, Washington is I-5.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,880
Okay, so already that's not double digits, but maybe officially it has a leading zero,

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,560
but just not on the sign, right, Department of Transportation?

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,480
No? Okay, well then, I-5 has a leading zero in our hearts.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,360
The rest of the North-South Interstate Majors are

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Petersburg, Virginia to Montgomery, Alabama I-85,

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
a bit of a sister route to I-30,

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,320
San Diego, California to Sweetgrass, Montana I-15,

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,960
Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to Hialeah, Florida I-75,

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Las Cruces, New Mexico to Buffalo, Wyoming I-25,

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,960
then I-45 from Houston, Texas to Dallas, Texas.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,880
Contrary to popular belief, interstates don't have to be interstate interstates.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,800
They can be intrastate interstates.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,600
The obvious examples are Hawaii and Alaska, which have intrastate interstates,

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,000
but also Puerto Rico, which has an extra state intrastate?

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,920
I mean, I guess technically it's an extra inter-unincorporated territory?

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Anyway, these three being physically disconnected from the rest of the network

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,200
use a different numbering system with letters.

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,440
But back on the continent, there are in fact

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,120
way more intrastate interstates than interstate interstates.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Most are the interstate minors we will get to,

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
but I-45 is notable for being the only interstate major that's intrastate.

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,080
Finishing up the North-South Majors, it's Texas again in Laredo to Duluth, Minnesota I-35,

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,840
then Chicago, Illinois to Laplace, Louisiana I-55,

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,880
and finally hop over to Mobile, Alabama up to Gary, Indiana on I-65.

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,160
Together, the interstate major constellation with its shining numbers

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,800
lets you navigate the nation.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
The lower the numbers, the more south and west you are, the higher north and east.

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,960
If it ends in zero, you're traveling horizontally, and if it ends in five, vertically.

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,600
Very satisfying.

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,920
Now, there are scores of lesser connecting constellations as well.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
These are interstate minors and use three digits to communicate their navigational secrets.

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Interstate minors diverge from a major

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,720
and have their last two digits match the major from whence they came.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,560
Then, if the first digit is even,

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,360
it means the interstate minor will eventually connect back to its parent major.

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,680
For example, as I-70 crosses the nation, I-670 diverts in Kansas City, Missouri,

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,680
but eventually circles back to connect to I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,000
Even-numbered minors are often called bypasses when they bypass something

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
or beltways when they encircle something.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,000
An interstate minor that starts with an odd number

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,600
warns that it will not connect back to its parent.

76
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
This is called a spur.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,560
Example, as I-90 goes past Buffalo, I-190 diverges,

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,240
and the odd digit lets you know you won't be coming back,

79
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,600
instead plunging one way into the wilds of Canada.

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,320
Nice! Though sometimes a spur won't just go nowhere,

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
it will instead connect back to another interstate major.

82
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,480
In this case, which of the double digits are used as the base of the triple?

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,000
And the answer is...

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,480
there isn't a consistent answer. It's up to the states.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,200
So that's interstate majors and minors,

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,080
but there's also interstate mediums,

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,200
like I-64 from Wentzville, Missouri to Chesapeake, Virginia

88
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,640
and I-29 from Kansas City, Missouri to Pembrona, North Dakota.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,160
The interstate mediums follow the same numbering pattern as the majors,

90
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
all two digits, if we keep those leading zeros in our hearts,

91
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,200
evens east-west, odds north-south.

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,120
All in order too, except for I-99, which is so annoying.

93
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
DOT, why did you do this?

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,120
What? Congress specifically picked 99 out of order for this highway

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,840
so Congress is the only one who can fix it?

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Ugh!

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,520
Well, let's just try to ignore that and move on.

98
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,880
The interstate majors are all uniquely numbered,

99
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,680
but not so with the mediums.

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,040
There's an I-76 from Big Springs, Nebraska to Denver, Colorado

101
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,400
and another I-76 from Belmar, New Jersey to Akron, Ohio.

102
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,720
Sandwiched between the majors I-90 and I-80

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,880
are duplicate medium I-84s, I-86s, I-87s and I-88s.

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,960
The rule is that, as long as the duplicates are far enough away

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,080
to avoid muddling mines, it's fine.

106
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,960
There are also loads of duplicate interstate minors,

107
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,000
which there have to be if you think about it.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,160
Take I-95, which crosses 15 densely populated states.

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,000
To only have nine options for spurs and bypasses would be rather limiting.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,480
In fact, just Maryland alone has an I-195, I-295, I-395, I-495, I-595, I-695, I-795, I-895 and—

111
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,080
Really? Ugh! So close!

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,920
DOT, you've got to build an I-995 in Maryland just to complete the set for me, please!

113
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,840
So that's the system, but as we've already seen with interstate mediums,

114
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,120
anything built over decades is going to acquire exceptions.

115
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,720
And taking a little detour to my home interstate, I-495,

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,120
AKA the Long Island Expressway, AKA the LIE,

117
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,000
don't dare call it the lie or locals will laugh at you,

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
this is the spinal spur of the Long Island fish,

119
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,080
never connecting back to its parent I-95 because Long Island is an island.

120
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,360
But as a one-way spur, it should start with an odd digit, not an even.

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,440
And it really should be a two-digit interstate medium

122
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,040
because it technically doesn't connect to I-95 at all.

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,120
Rather just dropping you off in midtown Manhattan with an LOL buddy

124
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,080
good luck finding the Lincoln Tunnel.

125
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,040
I guess the LIE is a lie, after all.

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,320
A worse exception on the other coast in San Francisco is Interstate 238,

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,280
which the number tells you should be a bypass off of I-38,

128
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,360
but no, I-38 doesn't exist.

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,560
I-238 is a one-way spur connecting two other interstate miners,

130
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,920
I-580 and I-880, so I don't even know what's going on here.

131
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,640
There's also some weirdly one-off numbering, such as I-35,

132
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,760
which splits into I-35 East and I-35 West

133
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,400
to reach Fort Worth and Dallas before rejoining and pulls the same trick up north,

134
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,680
dividing in twain east-west branches again to hit the Twin Cities.

135
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,160
Why wasn't just one of the branches on each end

136
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
picked to be the bypass so that the system could be consistent?

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
Was it because the cities didn't want to be the one considered bypassed?

138
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,840
Ugh, that's totally the reason, isn't it?

139
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,560
The weirdest one-off is the nice I-69,

140
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,640
which splits itself into I-69 East, I-69 West and I-69 Sea.

141
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,920
Okay, you do you, I-69.

142
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
At least you have a sign, unlike back in New York

143
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,360
with America's smallest Interstate 878 at just under a mile,

144
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,760
which apparently doesn't deserve a sign,

145
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,040
so the interstate anoraks can never complete their selfie collection.

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,600
Okay, that's enough exceptions.

147
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,520
I could do this all day, I already cut so many from the script you wouldn't believe it.

148
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,400
Back to the big, beautiful, constructed constellation and its lost wayfinding ways.

149
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,480
Now revealed so that, as your ancestors before you navigated by the sky,

150
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,240
you too can go on an American road trip navigating by the interstate numbers alone.

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,480
Well, after you memorize all the exceptions.

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,720
I mean, practically, you should still just use your GPS.

153
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
It's very reliable, and it also lets you know the traffic.
