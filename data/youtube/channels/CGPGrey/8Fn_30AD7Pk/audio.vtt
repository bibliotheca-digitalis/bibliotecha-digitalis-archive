00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
The Interstate Highway shields hide within them long-forgotten knowledge.

00:04.120 --> 00:09.760
As our great ancestors could navigate by the signs in the sky before the creation of the compass,

00:09.760 --> 00:14.160
so too before GPS could they navigate by these signs.

00:14.160 --> 00:19.280
Come with me and learn how to navigate the constellations created across a continent by

00:19.280 --> 00:20.960
the Interstate Highway System.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.400
First are the Interstate Majors, beginning with I-90 from Seattle to Boston,

00:25.400 --> 00:27.440
the longest and northernest of all the I's.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.760
Then the southernest, Jacksonville, Florida to Santa Monica, California, I-10.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.320
Interstate Majors that run east-west are double digits ending in zero,

00:35.320 --> 00:37.720
the bigger the northerner, so filling in the rest,

00:37.720 --> 00:41.720
the next northernest is San Francisco, California to Teaneck, New Jersey, I-80,

00:41.720 --> 00:45.120
and the next southernest, Florence, South Carolina to Kent, Texas, I-20.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.840
Then Co-Fort Utah to Baltimore, Maryland, I-70,

00:47.840 --> 00:50.560
and Little Rock, Arkansas to Fort Worth, Texas, I-30.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.120
Okay, so that one is the most minor of the Majors,

00:53.120 --> 00:56.920
and it doesn't quite fit as well with the rest, with its diagonality.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.280
But I'm confident it's the lone exception and not foreshadowing.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.440
Next Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina, I-40,

01:03.440 --> 01:06.520
then I-50 and I-60, which don't exist.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.560
See, there are older highways than the Interstate System,

01:09.560 --> 01:13.920
slower otherways not built to the Interstate's Book of Exalted Construction Codes.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.000
These are called US Highways or US Routes, the most famous of which is Route 66,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.720
and these use the United States Numbered Highway System,

01:20.720 --> 01:23.920
which put the old US Route 50 and 60 right in the middle.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.600
The Department of Transportation knew that only the most devout roadway anoraks

01:27.600 --> 01:30.240
would be attuned to the difference between Interstates and Routes,

01:30.240 --> 01:32.000
and normals would simply look at the number.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.280
To simplify everyone's life,

01:33.280 --> 01:38.000
DOT skipped Interstates 50 and 60 to avoid mines getting muddled in the middle of America.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.120
That's the East-West Interstate Majors' coverage.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.440
Now on to North-South, the longest of which is Maine to Miami, Florida, I-95,

01:44.440 --> 01:47.200
which, like all Majors, no exception surely, are double digits,

01:47.200 --> 01:50.000
but ending in 5 now to indicate verticality.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.760
On the opposite coast, San Diego, California to Blaine, Washington is I-5.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.880
Okay, so already that's not double digits, but maybe officially it has a leading zero,

01:57.880 --> 02:01.560
but just not on the sign, right, Department of Transportation?

02:01.560 --> 02:06.480
No? Okay, well then, I-5 has a leading zero in our hearts.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.360
The rest of the North-South Interstate Majors are

02:08.360 --> 02:11.080
Petersburg, Virginia to Montgomery, Alabama I-85,

02:11.080 --> 02:12.480
a bit of a sister route to I-30,

02:12.480 --> 02:15.320
San Diego, California to Sweetgrass, Montana I-15,

02:15.320 --> 02:17.960
Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to Hialeah, Florida I-75,

02:17.960 --> 02:20.600
Las Cruces, New Mexico to Buffalo, Wyoming I-25,

02:20.600 --> 02:23.960
then I-45 from Houston, Texas to Dallas, Texas.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.880
Contrary to popular belief, interstates don't have to be interstate interstates.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.800
They can be intrastate interstates.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.600
The obvious examples are Hawaii and Alaska, which have intrastate interstates,

02:33.600 --> 02:38.000
but also Puerto Rico, which has an extra state intrastate?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.920
I mean, I guess technically it's an extra inter-unincorporated territory?

02:42.920 --> 02:46.120
Anyway, these three being physically disconnected from the rest of the network

02:46.120 --> 02:48.200
use a different numbering system with letters.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.440
But back on the continent, there are in fact

02:50.440 --> 02:54.120
way more intrastate interstates than interstate interstates.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.000
Most are the interstate minors we will get to,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.720
but I-45 is notable for being the only interstate major that's intrastate.

03:00.720 --> 03:05.080
Finishing up the North-South Majors, it's Texas again in Laredo to Duluth, Minnesota I-35,

03:05.080 --> 03:07.840
then Chicago, Illinois to Laplace, Louisiana I-55,

03:07.840 --> 03:11.880
and finally hop over to Mobile, Alabama up to Gary, Indiana on I-65.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.160
Together, the interstate major constellation with its shining numbers

03:15.160 --> 03:16.800
lets you navigate the nation.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.640
The lower the numbers, the more south and west you are, the higher north and east.

03:20.640 --> 03:24.960
If it ends in zero, you're traveling horizontally, and if it ends in five, vertically.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.600
Very satisfying.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.920
Now, there are scores of lesser connecting constellations as well.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.720
These are interstate minors and use three digits to communicate their navigational secrets.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.520
Interstate minors diverge from a major

03:36.520 --> 03:39.720
and have their last two digits match the major from whence they came.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.560
Then, if the first digit is even,

03:41.560 --> 03:45.360
it means the interstate minor will eventually connect back to its parent major.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.680
For example, as I-70 crosses the nation, I-670 diverts in Kansas City, Missouri,

03:50.680 --> 03:54.680
but eventually circles back to connect to I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas.

03:54.680 --> 03:58.000
Even-numbered minors are often called bypasses when they bypass something

03:58.000 --> 03:59.760
or beltways when they encircle something.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.000
An interstate minor that starts with an odd number

04:02.000 --> 04:04.600
warns that it will not connect back to its parent.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.000
This is called a spur.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.560
Example, as I-90 goes past Buffalo, I-190 diverges,

04:09.560 --> 04:12.240
and the odd digit lets you know you won't be coming back,

04:12.280 --> 04:15.600
instead plunging one way into the wilds of Canada.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.320
Nice! Though sometimes a spur won't just go nowhere,

04:18.320 --> 04:21.320
it will instead connect back to another interstate major.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.480
In this case, which of the double digits are used as the base of the triple?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.000
And the answer is...

04:26.000 --> 04:28.480
there isn't a consistent answer. It's up to the states.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.200
So that's interstate majors and minors,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.080
but there's also interstate mediums,

04:32.080 --> 04:35.200
like I-64 from Wentzville, Missouri to Chesapeake, Virginia

04:35.200 --> 04:38.640
and I-29 from Kansas City, Missouri to Pembrona, North Dakota.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.160
The interstate mediums follow the same numbering pattern as the majors,

04:42.160 --> 04:44.960
all two digits, if we keep those leading zeros in our hearts,

04:44.960 --> 04:47.200
evens east-west, odds north-south.

04:47.200 --> 04:53.120
All in order too, except for I-99, which is so annoying.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.600
DOT, why did you do this?

04:55.600 --> 05:00.120
What? Congress specifically picked 99 out of order for this highway

05:00.120 --> 05:02.840
so Congress is the only one who can fix it?

05:02.840 --> 05:04.000
Ugh!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.520
Well, let's just try to ignore that and move on.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.880
The interstate majors are all uniquely numbered,

05:08.880 --> 05:10.680
but not so with the mediums.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.040
There's an I-76 from Big Springs, Nebraska to Denver, Colorado

05:14.040 --> 05:17.400
and another I-76 from Belmar, New Jersey to Akron, Ohio.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.720
Sandwiched between the majors I-90 and I-80

05:19.720 --> 05:23.880
are duplicate medium I-84s, I-86s, I-87s and I-88s.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.960
The rule is that, as long as the duplicates are far enough away

05:26.960 --> 05:29.080
to avoid muddling mines, it's fine.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.960
There are also loads of duplicate interstate minors,

05:31.960 --> 05:34.000
which there have to be if you think about it.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.160
Take I-95, which crosses 15 densely populated states.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.000
To only have nine options for spurs and bypasses would be rather limiting.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.480
In fact, just Maryland alone has an I-195, I-295, I-395, I-495, I-595, I-695, I-795, I-895 andâ€”

05:51.480 --> 05:54.080
Really? Ugh! So close!

05:54.080 --> 05:58.920
DOT, you've got to build an I-995 in Maryland just to complete the set for me, please!

05:58.920 --> 06:02.840
So that's the system, but as we've already seen with interstate mediums,

06:02.840 --> 06:06.120
anything built over decades is going to acquire exceptions.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.720
And taking a little detour to my home interstate, I-495,

06:09.720 --> 06:12.120
AKA the Long Island Expressway, AKA the LIE,

06:12.120 --> 06:14.000
don't dare call it the lie or locals will laugh at you,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.560
this is the spinal spur of the Long Island fish,

06:16.560 --> 06:21.080
never connecting back to its parent I-95 because Long Island is an island.

06:21.080 --> 06:25.360
But as a one-way spur, it should start with an odd digit, not an even.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.440
And it really should be a two-digit interstate medium

06:28.440 --> 06:32.040
because it technically doesn't connect to I-95 at all.

06:32.040 --> 06:36.120
Rather just dropping you off in midtown Manhattan with an LOL buddy

06:36.120 --> 06:38.080
good luck finding the Lincoln Tunnel.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.040
I guess the LIE is a lie, after all.

06:40.040 --> 06:44.320
A worse exception on the other coast in San Francisco is Interstate 238,

06:44.320 --> 06:48.280
which the number tells you should be a bypass off of I-38,

06:48.280 --> 06:51.360
but no, I-38 doesn't exist.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.560
I-238 is a one-way spur connecting two other interstate miners,

06:55.560 --> 06:59.920
I-580 and I-880, so I don't even know what's going on here.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.640
There's also some weirdly one-off numbering, such as I-35,

07:03.640 --> 07:06.760
which splits into I-35 East and I-35 West

07:06.760 --> 07:10.400
to reach Fort Worth and Dallas before rejoining and pulls the same trick up north,

07:10.400 --> 07:13.680
dividing in twain east-west branches again to hit the Twin Cities.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.160
Why wasn't just one of the branches on each end

07:16.160 --> 07:19.120
picked to be the bypass so that the system could be consistent?

07:19.120 --> 07:22.960
Was it because the cities didn't want to be the one considered bypassed?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.840
Ugh, that's totally the reason, isn't it?

07:24.840 --> 07:27.560
The weirdest one-off is the nice I-69,

07:27.560 --> 07:33.640
which splits itself into I-69 East, I-69 West and I-69 Sea.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.920
Okay, you do you, I-69.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.720
At least you have a sign, unlike back in New York

07:38.720 --> 07:42.360
with America's smallest Interstate 878 at just under a mile,

07:42.360 --> 07:44.760
which apparently doesn't deserve a sign,

07:44.760 --> 07:48.040
so the interstate anoraks can never complete their selfie collection.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.600
Okay, that's enough exceptions.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.520
I could do this all day, I already cut so many from the script you wouldn't believe it.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.400
Back to the big, beautiful, constructed constellation and its lost wayfinding ways.

07:57.400 --> 08:02.480
Now revealed so that, as your ancestors before you navigated by the sky,

08:02.480 --> 08:08.240
you too can go on an American road trip navigating by the interstate numbers alone.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.480
Well, after you memorize all the exceptions.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.720
I mean, practically, you should still just use your GPS.

08:22.720 --> 08:26.160
It's very reliable, and it also lets you know the traffic.
