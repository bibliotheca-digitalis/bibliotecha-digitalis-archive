0	4120	The Interstate Highway shields hide within them long-forgotten knowledge.
4120	9760	As our great ancestors could navigate by the signs in the sky before the creation of the compass,
9760	14160	so too before GPS could they navigate by these signs.
14160	19280	Come with me and learn how to navigate the constellations created across a continent by
19280	20960	the Interstate Highway System.
20960	25400	First are the Interstate Majors, beginning with I-90 from Seattle to Boston,
25400	27440	the longest and northernest of all the I's.
27440	31760	Then the southernest, Jacksonville, Florida to Santa Monica, California, I-10.
31760	35320	Interstate Majors that run east-west are double digits ending in zero,
35320	37720	the bigger the northerner, so filling in the rest,
37720	41720	the next northernest is San Francisco, California to Teaneck, New Jersey, I-80,
41720	45120	and the next southernest, Florence, South Carolina to Kent, Texas, I-20.
45120	47840	Then Co-Fort Utah to Baltimore, Maryland, I-70,
47840	50560	and Little Rock, Arkansas to Fort Worth, Texas, I-30.
50560	53120	Okay, so that one is the most minor of the Majors,
53120	56920	and it doesn't quite fit as well with the rest, with its diagonality.
56920	60280	But I'm confident it's the lone exception and not foreshadowing.
60280	63440	Next Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina, I-40,
63440	66520	then I-50 and I-60, which don't exist.
66520	69560	See, there are older highways than the Interstate System,
69560	73920	slower otherways not built to the Interstate's Book of Exalted Construction Codes.
73920	78000	These are called US Highways or US Routes, the most famous of which is Route 66,
78000	80720	and these use the United States Numbered Highway System,
80720	83920	which put the old US Route 50 and 60 right in the middle.
83920	87600	The Department of Transportation knew that only the most devout roadway anoraks
87600	90240	would be attuned to the difference between Interstates and Routes,
90240	92000	and normals would simply look at the number.
92000	93280	To simplify everyone's life,
93280	98000	DOT skipped Interstates 50 and 60 to avoid mines getting muddled in the middle of America.
98000	100120	That's the East-West Interstate Majors' coverage.
100120	104440	Now on to North-South, the longest of which is Maine to Miami, Florida, I-95,
104440	107200	which, like all Majors, no exception surely, are double digits,
107200	110000	but ending in 5 now to indicate verticality.
110000	113760	On the opposite coast, San Diego, California to Blaine, Washington is I-5.
113760	117880	Okay, so already that's not double digits, but maybe officially it has a leading zero,
117880	121560	but just not on the sign, right, Department of Transportation?
121560	126480	No? Okay, well then, I-5 has a leading zero in our hearts.
126480	128360	The rest of the North-South Interstate Majors are
128360	131080	Petersburg, Virginia to Montgomery, Alabama I-85,
131080	132480	a bit of a sister route to I-30,
132480	135320	San Diego, California to Sweetgrass, Montana I-15,
135320	137960	Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to Hialeah, Florida I-75,
137960	140600	Las Cruces, New Mexico to Buffalo, Wyoming I-25,
140600	143960	then I-45 from Houston, Texas to Dallas, Texas.
143960	147880	Contrary to popular belief, interstates don't have to be interstate interstates.
147880	149800	They can be intrastate interstates.
149800	153600	The obvious examples are Hawaii and Alaska, which have intrastate interstates,
153600	158000	but also Puerto Rico, which has an extra state intrastate?
158000	162920	I mean, I guess technically it's an extra inter-unincorporated territory?
162920	166120	Anyway, these three being physically disconnected from the rest of the network
166120	168200	use a different numbering system with letters.
168200	170440	But back on the continent, there are in fact
170440	174120	way more intrastate interstates than interstate interstates.
174120	176000	Most are the interstate minors we will get to,
176000	180720	but I-45 is notable for being the only interstate major that's intrastate.
180720	185080	Finishing up the North-South Majors, it's Texas again in Laredo to Duluth, Minnesota I-35,
185080	187840	then Chicago, Illinois to Laplace, Louisiana I-55,
187840	191880	and finally hop over to Mobile, Alabama up to Gary, Indiana on I-65.
191880	195160	Together, the interstate major constellation with its shining numbers
195160	196800	lets you navigate the nation.
196800	200640	The lower the numbers, the more south and west you are, the higher north and east.
200640	204960	If it ends in zero, you're traveling horizontally, and if it ends in five, vertically.
204960	206600	Very satisfying.
206600	209920	Now, there are scores of lesser connecting constellations as well.
209920	214720	These are interstate minors and use three digits to communicate their navigational secrets.
214720	216520	Interstate minors diverge from a major
216520	219720	and have their last two digits match the major from whence they came.
219720	221560	Then, if the first digit is even,
221560	225360	it means the interstate minor will eventually connect back to its parent major.
225360	230680	For example, as I-70 crosses the nation, I-670 diverts in Kansas City, Missouri,
230680	234680	but eventually circles back to connect to I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas.
234680	238000	Even-numbered minors are often called bypasses when they bypass something
238000	239760	or beltways when they encircle something.
239760	242000	An interstate minor that starts with an odd number
242000	244600	warns that it will not connect back to its parent.
244600	246000	This is called a spur.
246000	249560	Example, as I-90 goes past Buffalo, I-190 diverges,
249560	252240	and the odd digit lets you know you won't be coming back,
252280	255600	instead plunging one way into the wilds of Canada.
255600	258320	Nice! Though sometimes a spur won't just go nowhere,
258320	261320	it will instead connect back to another interstate major.
261320	264480	In this case, which of the double digits are used as the base of the triple?
264480	266000	And the answer is...
266000	268480	there isn't a consistent answer. It's up to the states.
268480	270200	So that's interstate majors and minors,
270200	272080	but there's also interstate mediums,
272080	275200	like I-64 from Wentzville, Missouri to Chesapeake, Virginia
275200	278640	and I-29 from Kansas City, Missouri to Pembrona, North Dakota.
278640	282160	The interstate mediums follow the same numbering pattern as the majors,
282160	284960	all two digits, if we keep those leading zeros in our hearts,
284960	287200	evens east-west, odds north-south.
287200	293120	All in order too, except for I-99, which is so annoying.
293120	295600	DOT, why did you do this?
295600	300120	What? Congress specifically picked 99 out of order for this highway
300120	302840	so Congress is the only one who can fix it?
302840	304000	Ugh!
304000	306520	Well, let's just try to ignore that and move on.
306520	308880	The interstate majors are all uniquely numbered,
308880	310680	but not so with the mediums.
310680	314040	There's an I-76 from Big Springs, Nebraska to Denver, Colorado
314040	317400	and another I-76 from Belmar, New Jersey to Akron, Ohio.
317400	319720	Sandwiched between the majors I-90 and I-80
319720	323880	are duplicate medium I-84s, I-86s, I-87s and I-88s.
323880	326960	The rule is that, as long as the duplicates are far enough away
326960	329080	to avoid muddling mines, it's fine.
329080	331960	There are also loads of duplicate interstate minors,
331960	334000	which there have to be if you think about it.
334000	338160	Take I-95, which crosses 15 densely populated states.
338160	343000	To only have nine options for spurs and bypasses would be rather limiting.
343000	351480	In fact, just Maryland alone has an I-195, I-295, I-395, I-495, I-595, I-695, I-795, I-895 andâ€”
351480	354080	Really? Ugh! So close!
354080	358920	DOT, you've got to build an I-995 in Maryland just to complete the set for me, please!
358920	362840	So that's the system, but as we've already seen with interstate mediums,
362840	366120	anything built over decades is going to acquire exceptions.
366120	369720	And taking a little detour to my home interstate, I-495,
369720	372120	AKA the Long Island Expressway, AKA the LIE,
372120	374000	don't dare call it the lie or locals will laugh at you,
374000	376560	this is the spinal spur of the Long Island fish,
376560	381080	never connecting back to its parent I-95 because Long Island is an island.
381080	385360	But as a one-way spur, it should start with an odd digit, not an even.
385360	388440	And it really should be a two-digit interstate medium
388440	392040	because it technically doesn't connect to I-95 at all.
392040	396120	Rather just dropping you off in midtown Manhattan with an LOL buddy
396120	398080	good luck finding the Lincoln Tunnel.
398080	400040	I guess the LIE is a lie, after all.
400040	404320	A worse exception on the other coast in San Francisco is Interstate 238,
404320	408280	which the number tells you should be a bypass off of I-38,
408280	411360	but no, I-38 doesn't exist.
411360	415560	I-238 is a one-way spur connecting two other interstate miners,
415560	419920	I-580 and I-880, so I don't even know what's going on here.
419920	423640	There's also some weirdly one-off numbering, such as I-35,
423640	426760	which splits into I-35 East and I-35 West
426760	430400	to reach Fort Worth and Dallas before rejoining and pulls the same trick up north,
430400	433680	dividing in twain east-west branches again to hit the Twin Cities.
433680	436160	Why wasn't just one of the branches on each end
436160	439120	picked to be the bypass so that the system could be consistent?
439120	442960	Was it because the cities didn't want to be the one considered bypassed?
442960	444840	Ugh, that's totally the reason, isn't it?
444840	447560	The weirdest one-off is the nice I-69,
447560	453640	which splits itself into I-69 East, I-69 West and I-69 Sea.
453640	455920	Okay, you do you, I-69.
455920	458720	At least you have a sign, unlike back in New York
458720	462360	with America's smallest Interstate 878 at just under a mile,
462360	464760	which apparently doesn't deserve a sign,
464760	468040	so the interstate anoraks can never complete their selfie collection.
468040	469600	Okay, that's enough exceptions.
469600	472520	I could do this all day, I already cut so many from the script you wouldn't believe it.
472520	477400	Back to the big, beautiful, constructed constellation and its lost wayfinding ways.
477400	482480	Now revealed so that, as your ancestors before you navigated by the sky,
482480	488240	you too can go on an American road trip navigating by the interstate numbers alone.
492960	495480	Well, after you memorize all the exceptions.
499760	502720	I mean, practically, you should still just use your GPS.
502720	506160	It's very reliable, and it also lets you know the traffic.
