0	4720	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
4720	6720	Yes!
17420	20860	Right now I'm in San Jose on a big summer work trip.
20860	26180	And I've got ten days to get to Moab, Utah, and then back down to LA.
26180	29340	With this much distance and that little time, I was gonna fly.
29360	31360	But then, someone I know said,
31360	33360	you should take this Tesla.
34240	38640	They said to me, sure, you haven't driven in eight years, but you've also never driven a Tesla.
38640	41200	I couldn't say no. It's time for a road trip.
41200	43200	Oh, so cool.
44200	46200	That is never gonna get old.
46200	48200	Oh my god, I can't believe this.
48200	50200	I am so nervous and so excited right now.
50200	53200	I have no words for this. Like, I can't even explain anything.
53200	55200	I just have to get started.
55200	57200	And we're just gonna go. That's what's gonna happen here.
59340	61340	Ah, f***ing hell.
61340	63340	Future Gray here, editing this video.
63340	65340	Now, Past Gray is very excited.
65340	70340	But what he doesn't know is, he's going to make this trip way harder for himself than need be.
70340	76340	And he's also going to make some of the dumbest, most dangerous decisions he's ever made in his adult life.
76340	79340	But he doesn't know that. Now you know that.
79340	86340	And he's also going to make some of the dumbest, most dangerous decisions he's ever made in his adult life.
86340	90340	But he doesn't know that. Now you know that. Back to the excitement.
90340	93340	Ah, f***ing hell.
93340	98340	This is the first moment in my life when I'm in a self-driving car that's self-driving.
98340	100340	No hands moment.
100340	102340	This is the first turn.
102340	104340	And it's doing it.
106340	108340	Obviously it should.
108340	110340	But it's still quite relieving to know.
113340	115340	Oh god, that's amazing.
117340	120340	Whoo! Man.
122340	125340	Alright. Alright.
127340	129340	Oh my god.
129340	131340	This was really overwhelming.
131340	136340	And I've spent all my adrenaline and I need to calm down and eat a sandwich.
136340	140340	I haven't done any significant driving for nearly a decade.
140340	144340	On the last road trip that I took, it ended in a pretty bad accident.
144340	149340	Everyone walked away, but after that I just didn't want to drive, so I hardly ever did it.
149340	154340	Which meant I was a nervous wreck every time I did, which made me drive even less.
154340	157340	And then, because I live in a big city, I didn't need to drive.
157340	160340	But I'm going to use this opportunity to start again.
160340	164340	I'm nervous, but so far the Tesla's made it a lot easier for me.
164340	166340	And boy have I missed driving.
166340	171340	Just coming back from the store and oh my god, is it beautiful.
171340	175340	Blue's not my color, but that car looks fantastic.
179340	182340	Now that I've done the first leg on the highway...
182340	185340	What is it, car? Oh, my seatbelt.
187340	192340	Now that I've done the first leg and I haven't died, it's fantastic.
192340	194340	It's an amazing car.
195340	200340	But now I'm going to spend a little bit in a more focused frame of mind,
200340	205340	playing around with all of the settings on the screen and figuring out a few things
205340	210340	before I continue onward with the next leg of this drive.
210340	225340	This has been a real moment in my life and just a fantastic driving experience.
225340	232340	But I noticed that the click and the animation of the click of the car are not synchronized.
232340	236340	So one star, literally unusable.
237340	244340	I've made it to the first supercharger location with 45 miles left on the battery,
244340	249340	which is way closer than I would ever cut it with a gas tank.
249340	252340	I have some real range anxiety with cars,
252340	256340	but I thought I would just trust the map and what it's telling me.
256340	262340	And so here I am waiting online for the next supercharger slot that's available.
262340	265340	OK, so this is the charger.
266340	268340	Oh, that's so cool.
271340	276340	Pulling in 104, 103 kilowatts, which is crazy.
276340	282340	And I need to leave it here for about 40 minutes before I continue on the next leg of the trip,
282340	288340	which is perfect because this is in a little mall area and I've got some errands I need to run.
288340	292340	OK, back from errands and there's a hat trick of X's.
292340	298340	It looks like we're pretty set to continue on the road.
298340	302340	Oh, my God, I can't believe how exciting this is.
302340	303340	Forgot about this.
303340	308340	Turns out the car won't let you drive if you're still plugged in.
308340	311340	So I'm guessing stop charging.
313340	316340	Oh, and it closed for me.
316340	318340	This car is goddamn magic.
318340	319340	All right, calm down.
319340	321340	Calm down.
321340	323340	It's very exciting. Calm down.
323340	326340	Oh, yeah, the door closes when I sit.
326340	329340	OK, OK, let's do this.
334340	339340	In half a mile, keep to the left onto I-80 East towards Redwood.
346340	362340	One of the great things about doing a road trip in America is all of these little rest stops that exist.
362340	366340	We can just pull over and take a break, go to the bathroom, maybe get a snack.
366340	368340	It's really nice.
368340	371340	Oh, and by the way, beware of snakes.
371340	375340	Every vessel needs a name and she seems like a Bailey.
376340	378340	To you, Bailey Blue.
378340	380340	I look forward to our trip together.
394340	398340	So, holy shit, it's snowing.
398340	402340	We're up high enough that there's snow on the ground.
406340	408340	This is unbelievable.
408340	414340	I'm not sure it looks the way on the camera, but holy hell is the visibility low.
415340	419340	It's like there's a gas station in the corner.
419340	421340	I feel like I'm in the mist.
421340	424340	Look at this. It's amazing.
425340	428340	So I'm totally unprepared for this weather.
428340	432340	This hoodie is very warm, but it's not snow warm.
432340	437340	But I'm taking a little break here because the visibility was just zero on the freeway.
437340	441340	And it never snows in London.
441340	451340	I've gone all year without seeing any snow and I'm just so excited right now and happy and very cold.
451340	458340	And I just wanted to walk over and see what this little thing was in the snow.
459340	462340	Beautiful, beautiful snow.
462340	466340	Look at those trucks in the snow, in the forest, in the background.
466340	468340	It's just beautiful.
469340	475340	Okay, it is beautiful, but I'm also freezing.
476340	482340	Okay, I've realized it's actually going to get pretty dark soon.
483340	488340	And I'm at like 5,000 feet.
488340	495340	I think the only way out of this is through the snow and I want to do it before it gets dark.
495340	499340	So I'm going to load up on some rest stop coffee and then we're going to get going.
499340	502340	We're all strapped in the back seat.
502340	504340	Stay cozy.
505340	508340	We've got some serious snow to drive through.
542340	559340	I didn't realize that the road I was driving over is the Donner Pass.
559340	564340	I feel like the luckiest man alive right now.
565340	571340	I bumped into a guy who's flying a drone and now I really feel like I need a drone.
571340	573340	I don't need a drone.
574340	578340	Well, this has been quite the first day back at driving.
578340	581340	In any other car, I would have been terrified through that.
581340	583340	Thank you, Bailey Blue.
594340	597340	Well, that was f***ing amazing.
597340	606340	Alright, I was planning to go farther today, but the snow in the Donner Pass, that took a while and it took a lot out of me.
606340	613340	So I'm going to do the smart thing and I'm not going to push further.
614340	616340	Does that lock in?
616340	618340	I'm going to get, there we go.
618340	628340	I'm going to get a hotel in the local area instead of being a crazy person and pushing on to Reno.
630340	636340	Nearest hotel is apparently like a cabin in the woods.
636340	638340	Very Christmassy. Feels appropriate.
638340	640340	This was a good decision.
641340	647340	The instant I stopped driving, I realized I am tireder than I thought I was.
649340	656340	So I am very glad to be getting into a room to be able to spend the night and relax.
656340	658340	Ooh, a desk.
658340	667340	Alright, time to set up a workstation and pull all the footage off those cards and see what I was actually able to keep in the end.
670340	674340	I love the snow. I love the cold.
675340	680340	Speaking of cold, okay, so last night I wanted to test a thing.
680340	698340	There's a way to charge a Tesla from just regular, unregular electrical outlets, which I spotted on the outside of the hotel I set up last night.
698340	709340	So, it didn't look too promising last night, but I just want to see this morning how has it done.
712340	717340	Oh, it's charging at 3 miles per hour. We've added 22 miles overnight.
717340	725340	This is really good because this means I can possibly try something that I was thinking about last night.
725340	731340	Now to get to Moab, here's what I should do. I should take Interstate 80 up to Salt Lake City.
731340	735340	That's the smart route. It's filled with these superchargers.
735340	739340	If you're driving a Tesla a really long way, these things charge it up really fast.
739340	744340	The only thing is, I've already driven across this road, so I have an idea for a different route.
744340	752340	A more interesting ride that I've never done is this way, across what's known as the loneliest road in America, for good reason.
752340	754340	There's nothing out there, including superchargers.
755340	762340	This distance is way too long for a Tesla to do on a single charge, but I've discovered these things.
762340	766340	RV parks. It'll charge a lot slower than a supercharger, but it'll work.
766340	771340	There's an RV park here at Fox Peak Station, and there's an RV park here at Eli.
771340	779340	This distance is 283 miles, and a Tesla's maximum range is 300 miles.
779340	783340	If I get stranded along this road, it's going to be a real problem.
783340	788340	So, in order to make this work, Fox Peak equals 100% charge.
788340	792340	I cannot leave Fox Peak with less than a completely full battery.
792340	796340	Otherwise, I might not make it, and there is nothing out here.
796340	798340	So that's the plan.
798340	806340	It's 6.30 in the morning. I'm happy to have woken up and get started early, because today might be the longest day of driving.
806340	812340	But of course, before we can get started, navigate to the nearest Starbucks.
812340	819340	There's nothing cozier than being in a snowy world in a warm car on your way to get some coffee.
820340	823340	Sounds like a coffee emergency, whatever that was.
825340	836340	I was talking to the barista at Starbucks, and she said that this kind of snow in June is something she's only seen four times in the 20 years she's lived here.
836340	843340	So, I was feeling like the luckiest man alive yesterday, and now I feel just twice as lucky that I get to see this.
852340	854340	Reno on the horizon.
859340	862340	Ooh, it's still pretty cold out here.
862340	864340	Alright, let's go inside this casino.
867340	872340	Boy, I sure hope I don't miss what's on this channel.
888340	890340	It's a buffet reimagined.
891340	895340	Uh, yeah, I'm gonna need two, both with bacon, egg, and cheese.
896340	900340	I don't know why I said egg. Of course there's egg in it, yeah. No, bacon and cheese, yeah.
902340	903340	Two, please.
904340	907340	Hahaha, I'm not really two people though, am I?
908340	912340	Second coffee acquired, because we all know the first coffee is a warm-up.
912340	915340	And now we're on to Fallon.
916340	922340	This place is the test, where we find out if I can do the route I want or not.
922340	927340	Uh, oh, Fox Peak, not Pizza Hut. Fox Peak Station.
928340	930340	This is the moment of truth.
931340	934340	Let's see what we have here.
937340	942340	I'm thinking that this part doesn't go into that part, and I have no other adapters that can bridge the gap.
942340	945340	This thing has the same thing, so what I need to do is plug that.
946340	948340	Come on, baby. Alright, you're gonna get one there.
949340	954340	Yes, I need my credit card for like the 70th time. Authorizing, authorizing.
955340	957340	Hey, alright.
958340	961340	Oh my god, it's a miracle. Oh, it's gonna take a long time.
962340	965340	Sitting here with the Tesla, getting it charged for the next leg of the journey.
966340	968340	Uh, it's a little pooped. I'm a little pooped.
968340	981340	I'm also a bit coffeed out, so I'm going to get some of my replacement coffee pills, which are nice, and have some of that.
982340	988340	And then I think I'll show you, while I wait, a couple of the features of this Tesla.
989340	994340	Fighter jets from the Air Force Base. So loud.
995340	1000340	Alright, the number one thing I worried about before driving the Tesla was this a ginormous screen and how distracting it would be.
1001340	1003340	I mean, it is huge, but it handles really well.
1004340	1009340	So when you hit the navigation, right, so I'm going to navigate, I want to get to Eli, Nevada.
1010340	1013340	What it'll do, and it would fill in if we had any kind of internet connection,
1014340	1020340	it'll show an overview of your route if you want, or it'll show a particular leg, like to the next supercharger.
1020340	1024340	But it doesn't actually really tell you how to drive here.
1025340	1030340	That is through the steering wheel on this little screen.
1031340	1035340	So you don't have to be looking at this gigantic screen over here to see where you're supposed to turn.
1036340	1043340	Instead, the turn-by-turn directions are right here, and when you're driving, it's exactly in your field of view.
1044340	1048340	I feel like this is precisely where I want to be looking to see the turn-by-turn directions, so thumbs up for that.
1048340	1055340	There's a bunch of other stuff that you can do with the screen, but what I like is the rearview mirror doesn't give you a huge field of view here, but it doesn't matter.
1056340	1063340	Because here, there's a button for the camera, so you can hit a rearview camera, and that shows you what's behind the car.
1064340	1071340	And then you can take these two windows and say, swap them, so that your overview of your trip is up here,
1072340	1076340	your rearview mirror is here, and you can even fullscreen this a little bit more,
1076340	1080340	so it's as big as it can possibly be, and I like this setup for driving.
1081340	1084340	Okay, let's take a look at the car. You have this little magic key fob.
1085340	1090340	When you get close, the car recognizes you're coming by, so it starts turning on, the mirror folds out,
1091340	1095340	you can press the door, and the door opens up automatically, which is super nice.
1096340	1100340	A thing that I thought was a total gimmick, but I love it, is when you get in the car,
1100340	1106340	when you press the brake, the side door closes automatically.
1107340	1110340	This is a Belkin something or other, one star, do not recommend.
1111340	1117340	This wire, though, connects back to, there's a little nice dash space,
1118340	1120340	where you can plug in a traditional cigarette lighter.
1121340	1127340	It also has two USB-A ports, which is charging my laptop, actually, from the battery of the car,
1127340	1134340	and another wire, which is going up to the dash cam that I have set up, so that you can see what's going on on this road trip.
1135340	1139340	From inside the car, you can actually control the doors as well,
1140340	1145340	so you can say that you want the driver door open and the passenger door open, and they'll just go.
1146340	1148340	Alright, let's get out to watch the impressive thing that everybody likes,
1149340	1151340	which is the amazing Falcon wing doors on this thing.
1151340	1157340	Apparently, in the settings, they have some auto-height features that will open up higher or lower based on the space that you're in.
1158340	1159340	The trunk of the car also goes up.
1160340	1164340	These are all the wires and adapters I was messing around with before to actually charge the Tesla.
1165340	1166340	They come in this nice little case.
1167340	1172340	Obviously, on this road trip, I'm not carrying around one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people,
1173340	1174340	so instead I have these seats go flat.
1175340	1176340	There's a little button on the top here you press.
1176340	1180340	When you press it, the head pops down.
1181340	1186340	You can then fold the whole thing flat, so it gives you just a ton of space.
1187340	1189340	Alright, that's the trunk. Let's go around to the frunk.
1190340	1194340	We can take a look at the engine inside. It's pretty awesome.
1195340	1198340	LOL. No engine, of course, because this is a Tesla,
1199340	1204340	so we don't need all that disgusting, fluid-y, engine-y stuff that your grandpa knows how to fix,
1204340	1207340	but you don't really care about. There's nothing in here.
1208340	1211340	The whole car is really just the wheelbase, the other wheelbase,
1212340	1217340	and a big battery that connects the two of them with some electrical engines that spin both of the wheels.
1218340	1220340	But everything above that is just car.
1221340	1222340	So now with all that space, you may be asking yourself,
1223340	1227340	Bray, I haven't seen any suitcases on this trip.
1228340	1232340	I haven't seen any luggage, you know, the kind of stuff that you'd need for a big old road trip.
1232340	1235340	Like, this car is pretty empty.
1236340	1239340	Because there's no traditional car stuff taking all the space, there's space everywhere,
1240340	1245340	including right here in the back, there's a panel that you can pull up,
1246340	1250340	and here is where I've actually hidden all of the stuff that I've packed.
1251340	1253340	I like it to look like I'm not carrying all my possessions in the car.
1254340	1257340	The only other thing then are these cup holders.
1258340	1260340	I don't know if it's the way I fit in a car or what,
1260340	1263340	but this cup holder is impossible for me to reach.
1264340	1267340	I have to move my arm all the way back behind the seat
1268340	1271340	to then move it forward to be able to get the drink and up.
1272340	1275340	Like, my elbow naturally goes exactly where this cup holder is.
1276340	1279340	There should be a cup holder here, or there should be a cup holder here,
1280340	1281340	but this spot...
1284340	1287340	That spot is no bueno for a cup holder.
1287340	1290340	Alright, that's everything. It's time to pack it up and figure out what we're doing.
1299340	1302340	God, those doggies have a bed at the front of the RV.
1303340	1305340	Those must be the happiest doggies in the world.
1307340	1309340	Yeah, good doggo!
1310340	1311340	Okay, I think I've been sitting here long enough.
1312340	1313340	Now, I know past me said something like,
1313340	1317340	I cannot leave Fox Peak with less than a completely full battery.
1318340	1319340	But you know what? I'm not obligated to that guy.
1320340	1321340	He's not here right now.
1322340	1324340	I've discovered something. I don't need to go to Eli.
1325340	1328340	I can go to a place called Austin in the middle.
1329340	1331340	There's an RV park in Austin that if I can get there,
1332340	1334340	they have a 50 amp charger.
1335340	1338340	Now, hopefully I have the right accessories to be able to make that work,
1339340	1342340	but I have a 20% margin of error to make it to Austin
1343340	1346340	to be able to charge, and I'm in a dice-rolling kind of mood.
1347340	1350340	I didn't come across the goddamn ocean to drive on a road I've already driven,
1351340	1353340	or to sit at a gas station for another three hours.
1354340	1356340	It's time to get out of here and go get possibly stranded in the desert.
1357340	1358340	What's the worst that can happen?
1359340	1360340	Well, death. Death is always the worst that can happen.
1361340	1363340	Okay, I actually spent the next 15 minutes finding every single setting
1364340	1367340	in the settings panel that I could flip to make energy savings
1368340	1371340	the maximum amount possible and get the cabin pre-cooled
1371340	1373340	to save energy on air conditioning as well,
1374340	1376340	so I didn't just bolt out of here.
1377340	1378340	I spent a long time being fussy about things.
1379340	1380340	But now it's time to go.
1381340	1382340	Alright, we're on the road.
1383340	1385340	There's a bunch of stuff that I can possibly do to extend the range just a little bit,
1386340	1389340	and so far so good. We're up 1%.
1390340	1394340	I'm sure that I'll read 100 by the time we get there if trends continue,
1395340	1396340	so I'm feeling pretty great.
1397340	1400340	Here we are together on the loneliest road in America.
1432340	1459340	We're about halfway to Austin, which is about halfway along my journey
1459340	1462340	of this section of the loneliest road.
1463340	1468340	We're estimating at 16% upon arrival in Austin, which is pretty good.
1470340	1471340	I think this was a good decision.
1472340	1473340	I think we're gonna make it.
1475340	1477340	Bailey Blue just popped up this alert.
1478340	1481340	She's getting concerned that we're too far from all the superchargers.
1484340	1485340	And I don't blame her.
1485340	1489340	We are smack dab in the middle of a supercharger desert.
1490340	1492340	Don't worry, you got me through those mountains.
1493340	1495340	I'll get you through this desert of electricity.
1497340	1498340	I hope.
1515340	1516340	I hope.
1545340	1572340	We've officially reached Austin city limits, and holy hell am I relieved.
1573340	1577340	Hello, Austin Community Services. Boy, am I glad to see you.
1578340	1581340	Now it's time to try and find the Pony Express RV camp.
1583340	1585340	Pony Express, or is that the next one down?
1586340	1587340	Okay, great. Thank you very much, man.
1588340	1590340	Oh my god, I'm so excited to be here.
1596340	1599340	Cold mine. That is what I'm looking for.
1600340	1602340	50 amp deliciousness.
1604340	1606340	This is the moment of truth, really.
1608340	1612340	Because if this doesn't work, I am kind of f***ed.
1613340	1615340	All right, you and you should go together.
1618340	1621340	Let's flip.
1623340	1624340	Okay.
1624340	1628340	Oh, that looks sketchy.
1634340	1637340	Awesome. Okay, fantastic.
1638340	1639340	We've at least got electricity.
1640340	1641340	We've got 40 amps.
1644340	1648340	So now I guess the question is to see if I can find a hotel where I can stay.
1649340	1651340	And there's one possibility here.
1651340	1655340	Which is, there's a hotel up the road.
1656340	1660340	We've got some keys and a toasty warm room, which I am super happy to have.
1661340	1664340	I am ridiculously unprepared for this weather.
1665340	1667340	I thought I was driving into the desert.
1668340	1670340	Oh my god, so warm.
1673340	1674340	Thank you, heater.
1675340	1676340	Thank you, door.
1677340	1678340	Thank you, desk.
1679340	1680340	Thank you, microwave.
1681340	1688340	So I realized yesterday that I had dramatically underestimated how much storage space I was going to need running all of these cameras.
1689340	1692340	And of course, right now I have files that exist only on the dashcams, and that's just one copy.
1693340	1695340	And one copy is none copy, so I have to get two copies.
1696340	1697340	So I need to copy it to something else.
1698340	1699340	When I copy it to something else, I need to...
1700340	1702340	No one cares. No one cares about your technical problems.
1712340	1717340	Ugh, I need some coffee.
1725340	1726340	Hello?
1729340	1730340	Hello?
1732340	1733340	Uh, okay.
1735340	1737340	After a night on the charger, we're all set.
1738340	1740340	Go, substitute coffee, go.
1741340	1742340	I need you.
1746340	1747340	Great.
1748340	1749340	Thank you, town of Austin.
1750340	1751340	Now it's on to Eli.
1753340	1754340	Supercharger desert.
1756340	1758340	And there's more to go.
1759340	1765340	I normally wear contacts when I'm driving, but my eyes are bothering me, so I'm back to my glasses.
1765340	1776340	But it is a driving into the sun morning, so I'm going to be pulling the super cool look of shades on top of prescription glasses.
1781340	1787340	I have never been, I think, on a longer, more isolated road than this.
1788340	1797340	I was worried about taking the Tesla where no Tesla is supposed to be, but this is a lifetime experience.
1812340	1815340	First real coffee of the day acquired.
1816340	1821340	At a lovely little cafe in Eureka. Man, I wish I had more time to explore this town.
1822340	1825340	I'm gonna be late enough for Moab as it is, so I gotta get going.
1826340	1832340	And the danger of stopping anywhere with a beautiful Bailey Blue Tesla is that everybody wants to talk about it.
1833340	1837340	So expect Tesla conversation-related delays wherever you go.
1838340	1844340	Now we just need to find a place to hook up and pay.
1846340	1848340	Oh, sweet.
1850340	1852340	Man, that never gets old.
1853340	1858340	Okay, the nice woman at the casino set me up with a license to park and a place to work in the hotel with internet.
1859340	1863340	Internets are few and far between here, and I need to download some work files.
1864340	1868340	If you listen to my podcast, you'll know that I like to use code names for my projects.
1869340	1872340	This summer is Ursus, so there's little statues calling to me.
1872340	1877340	If you're ever on the loneliest road, come see the bear. The first grade point.
1878340	1882340	And I wish I had more time to explore the town because it looks like there's a ton of interesting stuff here.
1883340	1887340	But once again, if I'm gonna get to Moab on time, I really need to get going.
1888340	1892340	Oh, hello. Hello. Oh my god, hello.
1893340	1895340	Somebody talked to me. Somebody knew.
1896340	1898340	What's her name? Her name is Tinkerbell.
1899340	1900340	Oh, hello, Tinkerbell.
1900340	1903340	This never gets old as you press the button.
1905340	1906340	Click.
1907340	1909340	The whole thing.
1917340	1924340	I'm listening to the episode of Cortex that we recorded back at WWDC for any final changes that need to be made.
1924340	1930340	And then if I ever have internet again, I will give the all okay for it to be posted.
1935340	1937340	We've made it to Deseret.
1938340	1941340	It didn't take long for Deseret to start looking like Deseret.
1942340	1949340	If you do drive in the west, make sure to get red-tinted sunglasses. It makes the whole experience better.
1950340	1955340	Not that this isn't beautiful, but upping the saturation sure doesn't hurt.
1956340	1965340	We're coming up on the town of Delta, which should have the last RV park for the loneliest road section of this trip.
1966340	1969340	I see RVs. Oh-ho-ho-ho.
1970340	1973340	Man, this is the nicest looking RV park I've seen yet.
1973340	1984340	Proper spaces, grass. Let's just see, do they have what I need? Oh, f**k.
1996340	1997340	Double f**k.
1998340	1999340	Alright, moment of truth.
2000340	2001340	Yes!
2003340	2007340	Flip the switch. Green, green, green, green. Yes!
2008340	2010340	Alright, fantastic.
2011340	2014340	Alright, Bailey Blue isn't the only one that needs some power.
2015340	2016340	It's dinner time.
2016340	2017340	It's dinner time.
2024340	2026340	So an interesting thing has happened.
2027340	2035340	Now that I'm here, there's a supercharger up here in Nafidi, Utah that I've never noticed before or I swear to God is brand new.
2036340	2038340	It wasn't there when I was looking at the routes a couple days ago.
2039340	2044340	I was thinking I needed to go to a supercharger down here, which would have been way out of the way.
2044340	2048340	But this one says I can make it there with 8% remaining.
2049340	2058340	Given all of this, it means that since I have reached the edge of the loneliest road in America and I am off the supercharger desert,
2059340	2063340	I can make it to a supercharger and make it to Moab tonight.
2064340	2069340	Every gamble on this trip so far has worked out amazingly, so I'm going to roll the dice one last time.
2069340	2075340	Daylight's burning, we've got to roll. Thank you Antelope RV Park in Delta.
2076340	2079340	You are the reason I might make it to Moab tonight.
2080340	2082340	Alright, I've got to put down the camera and we've got to go.
2089340	2091340	28 miles to spare.
2091340	2098340	Looks like we're topping out at around 270 miles per hour that we sit at the charger.
2099340	2102340	Superchargers, I feel like I really appreciate you after the loneliest road.
2103340	2106340	It was too easy at the beginning, but now I understand just how great you are.
2107340	2110340	Going to be 50 minutes here before we can move on to Green River.
2111340	2114340	I've got to say, I'm feeling pretty great just to be back on the supercharger network.
2115340	2119340	I feel like that's already quite an accomplishment.
2119340	2124340	So I don't know, maybe I'll charge up and...
2129340	2131340	Ooh, it's a truck train.
2134340	2137340	Okay, the hell with it. The sun's going down, but you know what?
2138340	2141340	I don't want to be showing up late tomorrow. I'd rather get there tonight.
2142340	2146340	Time for Tesla after dark. Let's do this.
2146340	2148340	Let's do this.
2176340	2203340	Green River or bust?
2206340	2220340	So I made a bad assumption that there were going to be lights all over this highway, and there are not.
2221340	2227340	I think I would have not done this if I had realized it was going to be in total darkness for 100 miles.
2228340	2230340	Umm, 83 miles to go.
2230340	2240340	Holy f***, am I glad to be off that highway.
2241340	2246340	Alright, I thought the most stressful driving was going to be that snow, but boy was I wrong.
2247340	2250340	I am literally shaking.
2251340	2254340	Just 20 minutes to kill while she's charging.
2255340	2260340	Okay, I'm full of adrenaline and nerves. I'm just going to walk around for a minute and shake it off.
2261340	2263340	I guess this is the eponymous Green River.
2264340	2266340	Alright, let's get back inside here.
2271340	2276340	Thank you John Wesley Powell History Museum for installing those Tesla chargers.
2278340	2282340	Alright, just a tiny bit longer until Moab, and then we're done for the night.
2284340	2292340	Nope, I'm going to stop it here. I can't show you any more fast forwarded footage with fun music underneath it.
2293340	2298340	This was a dumb dangerous decision at the end of a long series of dumb dangerous decisions.
2299340	2307340	I've been driving since Austin. I should have stopped at the RV park, I should have stopped at the supercharger, I definitely should have stopped at Green River, but I didn't.
2308340	2311340	This is how catastrophic errors happen, and I just got really lucky.
2311340	2316340	I will never do this again. Please go to bed if you're driving. Nothing is that important.
2317340	2318340	So I'm going to skip past all this now.
2342340	2343340	Alright, I can find you.
2344340	2346340	It's hard to get that spot, isn't it?
2348340	2349340	Alright, I'll be back later.
2349340	2377340	Okay, so while I was out here, Tesla literally announced the next version of their autopilot system with a ton of improvements, including more sensors, on ramp, off ramp ability,
2377340	2383340	better ability to hold tight the lanes and take turns and smart summon and a whole bunch of other stuff.
2384340	2390340	This is one of the things that I love about technology because technology involves the promise of constant iteration and improvement,
2391340	2403340	and it is the reason why I have just never cared about cars at all, but I've been really interested in Tesla since I first heard about them because it seems to me much less a car than a computer on wheels.
2408340	2412340	So I'm going to take you to the world.
2413340	2417340	Yeah, I'm going to love you.
2418340	2423340	I'll give you the world of what I've got.
2424340	2426340	Fast and fast, baby, I have not.
2427340	2428340	I'm just going to love you.
2429340	2432340	Yeah, I'm going to love you.
2433340	2435340	I'm going to love you, baby.
2436340	2438340	Cross my heart and hope you die.
2453340	2455340	I'm going to love you.
2483340	2485340	I'm going to love you.
2500340	2508340	This ceiling is really low. I can't actually stand up in this place.
2509340	2511340	Oh, God.
2513340	2516340	Oh, yeah, that's not creepy at all.
2521340	2523340	Oh, God.
2529340	2530340	Yeah, nope.
2531340	2532340	Nope, nope.
2536340	2537340	Nope.
2538340	2540340	Watch the hell out for that.
2541340	2556340	What makes it ten times creepier is it certainly seems like a ghost town, except there are a lot of these pretty shiny new no trespassing signs around.
2557340	2562340	There's a post office.
2567340	2569340	Which is, I'm going to guess, actually locked.
2570340	2572340	Yeah, see, so that's actually locked.
2573340	2575340	There's this new looking sign.
2576340	2577340	Smile, you're on camera.
2578340	2581340	A security camera that sure looks like it's active.
2583340	2584340	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2586340	2589340	Not going to lie, I'm kind of terrified to open this.
2596340	2597340	Jesus Christ.
2602340	2604340	This thing looks like a puzzle out of mist.
2605340	2607340	Well, I do actually have to go.
2608340	2611340	Wait, don't drop your phone down the toilet this time.
2611340	2615340	If you say so.
2623340	2624340	Well.
2627340	2629340	Time to go now, I think.
2630340	2636340	Cars do feel a bit like a bubble of security and safety that you can take with you wherever you go.
2637340	2645340	And I'm glad I came out to this ghost town, but the feeling like there are people around is creepy as all hell.
2646340	2655340	So I'm very happy to head back to that bubble of safety and security and get back to Moab.
2656340	2659340	In the car, lock the door.
2661340	2663340	Goodbye, Cisco.
2666340	2678340	I've been in Moab for a few days getting work done, getting podcast recording done.
2685340	2690340	All of my equipment is different and new. It's like, oh, Jesus Christ, fingers crossed.
2691340	2694340	Planning and preparing for the final and hardest part of this summer.
2694340	2698340	Which is VidCon. Not looking forward to that.
2699340	2705340	But also, and again, taking advantage of this unique and austerely beautiful part of the country.
2706340	2708340	Driving through the West is like nothing else.
2709340	2710340	This trip has been just what I needed.
2711340	2714340	Driving with Bailey, especially through some unexpected difficulties.
2715340	2718340	I've gotten over a lot of the fear and hesitation I had about driving.
2719340	2720340	I'm really appreciative for that.
2721340	2722340	This is my final day in Moab.
2723340	2728340	So I'm going to take the time to appreciate it too before I have to drive to L.A.
2741340	2743340	Got my coffee, got my music.
2744340	2748340	Now just four stops left until I have to be in L.A. and at VidCon.
2748340	2751340	But no need to dwell. Moab, I'll see you again soon.
2752340	2755340	Bailey, let's enjoy the last of the desert driving.
2759340	2761340	This is the entrance to the San Rafael Swell.
2762340	2767340	Alright Bailey, I know that our time together is growing short.
2769340	2774340	But I'm glad that I get to take you through one of my favorite sections of Interstate.
2778340	2779340	Let's do this girl.
2808340	2809340	We'll be right back.
2838340	2867340	Las Vegas Boulevard.
2868340	2872340	Oh man.
2898340	2910340	That is some serious solar paneling.
2911340	2912340	It's Factorio.
2913340	2915340	Man, I want that upgrade.
2919340	2921340	It's time to be agriculturally inspected.
2922340	2924340	This was the last charging pit stop for Bailey.
2924340	2928340	Not going to lie, I am getting pretty emotional about saying goodbye to this girl.
2929340	2931340	I feel like we've been through a lot together.
2937340	2939340	We've had a fun romp through the desert.
2940340	2944340	But I think we've got to clean you back up before you go back to your normal life.
2945340	2947340	The works of course. Only the best for Bailey.
2948340	2949340	I know you don't want a bath.
2950340	2951340	You'll be happy to be clean.
2951340	2955340	You know, you'll be glad to be back home once you're there.
2957340	2958340	See, doesn't that feel good?
2969340	2970340	Look how good you look.
2971340	2975340	Alright girl, let's get me to VidCon and you home.
2981340	2983340	Thank you.
3011340	3021340	We're almost there Bailey Blue. Almost there.
3041340	3043340	You're welcome.
