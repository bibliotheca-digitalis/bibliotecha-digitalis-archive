1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,720
Yes!

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,860
Right now I'm in San Jose on a big summer work trip.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,180
And I've got ten days to get to Moab, Utah, and then back down to LA.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,340
With this much distance and that little time, I was gonna fly.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
But then, someone I know said,

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,360
you should take this Tesla.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,640
They said to me, sure, you haven't driven in eight years, but you've also never driven a Tesla.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
I couldn't say no. It's time for a road trip.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Oh, so cool.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
That is never gonna get old.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Oh my god, I can't believe this.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
I am so nervous and so excited right now.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I have no words for this. Like, I can't even explain anything.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
I just have to get started.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
And we're just gonna go. That's what's gonna happen here.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,340
Ah, f***ing hell.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,340
Future Gray here, editing this video.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
Now, Past Gray is very excited.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,340
But what he doesn't know is, he's going to make this trip way harder for himself than need be.

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,340
And he's also going to make some of the dumbest, most dangerous decisions he's ever made in his adult life.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,340
But he doesn't know that. Now you know that.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,340
And he's also going to make some of the dumbest, most dangerous decisions he's ever made in his adult life.

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,340
But he doesn't know that. Now you know that. Back to the excitement.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Ah, f***ing hell.

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,340
This is the first moment in my life when I'm in a self-driving car that's self-driving.

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,340
No hands moment.

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,340
This is the first turn.

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,340
And it's doing it.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
Obviously it should.

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,340
But it's still quite relieving to know.

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,340
Oh god, that's amazing.

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,340
Whoo! Man.

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,340
Alright. Alright.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Oh my god.

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,340
This was really overwhelming.

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,340
And I've spent all my adrenaline and I need to calm down and eat a sandwich.

38
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,340
I haven't done any significant driving for nearly a decade.

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,340
On the last road trip that I took, it ended in a pretty bad accident.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Everyone walked away, but after that I just didn't want to drive, so I hardly ever did it.

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,340
Which meant I was a nervous wreck every time I did, which made me drive even less.

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,340
And then, because I live in a big city, I didn't need to drive.

43
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,340
But I'm going to use this opportunity to start again.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,340
I'm nervous, but so far the Tesla's made it a lot easier for me.

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
And boy have I missed driving.

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Just coming back from the store and oh my god, is it beautiful.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Blue's not my color, but that car looks fantastic.

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Now that I've done the first leg on the highway...

49
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,340
What is it, car? Oh, my seatbelt.

50
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Now that I've done the first leg and I haven't died, it's fantastic.

51
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,340
It's an amazing car.

52
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,340
But now I'm going to spend a little bit in a more focused frame of mind,

53
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,340
playing around with all of the settings on the screen and figuring out a few things

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,340
before I continue onward with the next leg of this drive.

55
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:45,340
This has been a real moment in my life and just a fantastic driving experience.

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:52,340
But I noticed that the click and the animation of the click of the car are not synchronized.

57
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,340
So one star, literally unusable.

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,340
I've made it to the first supercharger location with 45 miles left on the battery,

59
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,340
which is way closer than I would ever cut it with a gas tank.

60
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,340
I have some real range anxiety with cars,

61
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,340
but I thought I would just trust the map and what it's telling me.

62
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,340
And so here I am waiting online for the next supercharger slot that's available.

63
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,340
OK, so this is the charger.

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Oh, that's so cool.

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Pulling in 104, 103 kilowatts, which is crazy.

66
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,340
And I need to leave it here for about 40 minutes before I continue on the next leg of the trip,

67
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,340
which is perfect because this is in a little mall area and I've got some errands I need to run.

68
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,340
OK, back from errands and there's a hat trick of X's.

69
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,340
It looks like we're pretty set to continue on the road.

70
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Oh, my God, I can't believe how exciting this is.

71
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,340
Forgot about this.

72
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,340
Turns out the car won't let you drive if you're still plugged in.

73
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,340
So I'm guessing stop charging.

74
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Oh, and it closed for me.

75
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
This car is goddamn magic.

76
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
All right, calm down.

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Calm down.

78
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
It's very exciting. Calm down.

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Oh, yeah, the door closes when I sit.

80
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,340
OK, OK, let's do this.

81
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,340
In half a mile, keep to the left onto I-80 East towards Redwood.

82
00:05:46,340 --> 00:06:02,340
One of the great things about doing a road trip in America is all of these little rest stops that exist.

83
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,340
We can just pull over and take a break, go to the bathroom, maybe get a snack.

84
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,340
It's really nice.

85
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,340
Oh, and by the way, beware of snakes.

86
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,340
Every vessel needs a name and she seems like a Bailey.

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
To you, Bailey Blue.

88
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,340
I look forward to our trip together.

89
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,340
So, holy shit, it's snowing.

90
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,340
We're up high enough that there's snow on the ground.

91
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,340
This is unbelievable.

92
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,340
I'm not sure it looks the way on the camera, but holy hell is the visibility low.

93
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,340
It's like there's a gas station in the corner.

94
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I feel like I'm in the mist.

95
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,340
Look at this. It's amazing.

96
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,340
So I'm totally unprepared for this weather.

97
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,340
This hoodie is very warm, but it's not snow warm.

98
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,340
But I'm taking a little break here because the visibility was just zero on the freeway.

99
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,340
And it never snows in London.

100
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:31,340
I've gone all year without seeing any snow and I'm just so excited right now and happy and very cold.

101
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:38,340
And I just wanted to walk over and see what this little thing was in the snow.

102
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,340
Beautiful, beautiful snow.

103
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Look at those trucks in the snow, in the forest, in the background.

104
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
It's just beautiful.

105
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,340
Okay, it is beautiful, but I'm also freezing.

106
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,340
Okay, I've realized it's actually going to get pretty dark soon.

107
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,340
And I'm at like 5,000 feet.

108
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,340
I think the only way out of this is through the snow and I want to do it before it gets dark.

109
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,340
So I'm going to load up on some rest stop coffee and then we're going to get going.

110
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,340
We're all strapped in the back seat.

111
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Stay cozy.

112
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,340
We've got some serious snow to drive through.

113
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:19,340
I didn't realize that the road I was driving over is the Donner Pass.

114
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,340
I feel like the luckiest man alive right now.

115
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,340
I bumped into a guy who's flying a drone and now I really feel like I need a drone.

116
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
I don't need a drone.

117
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Well, this has been quite the first day back at driving.

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,340
In any other car, I would have been terrified through that.

119
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
Thank you, Bailey Blue.

120
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Well, that was f***ing amazing.

121
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Alright, I was planning to go farther today, but the snow in the Donner Pass, that took a while and it took a lot out of me.

122
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:13,340
So I'm going to do the smart thing and I'm not going to push further.

123
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Does that lock in?

124
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,340
I'm going to get, there we go.

125
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:28,340
I'm going to get a hotel in the local area instead of being a crazy person and pushing on to Reno.

126
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Nearest hotel is apparently like a cabin in the woods.

127
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Very Christmassy. Feels appropriate.

128
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
This was a good decision.

129
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,340
The instant I stopped driving, I realized I am tireder than I thought I was.

130
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:56,340
So I am very glad to be getting into a room to be able to spend the night and relax.

131
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Ooh, a desk.

132
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Alright, time to set up a workstation and pull all the footage off those cards and see what I was actually able to keep in the end.

133
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,340
I love the snow. I love the cold.

134
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Speaking of cold, okay, so last night I wanted to test a thing.

135
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:38,340
There's a way to charge a Tesla from just regular, unregular electrical outlets, which I spotted on the outside of the hotel I set up last night.

136
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:49,340
So, it didn't look too promising last night, but I just want to see this morning how has it done.

137
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Oh, it's charging at 3 miles per hour. We've added 22 miles overnight.

138
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:05,340
This is really good because this means I can possibly try something that I was thinking about last night.

139
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Now to get to Moab, here's what I should do. I should take Interstate 80 up to Salt Lake City.

140
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,340
That's the smart route. It's filled with these superchargers.

141
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,340
If you're driving a Tesla a really long way, these things charge it up really fast.

142
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,340
The only thing is, I've already driven across this road, so I have an idea for a different route.

143
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:32,340
A more interesting ride that I've never done is this way, across what's known as the loneliest road in America, for good reason.

144
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
There's nothing out there, including superchargers.

145
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:42,340
This distance is way too long for a Tesla to do on a single charge, but I've discovered these things.

146
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,340
RV parks. It'll charge a lot slower than a supercharger, but it'll work.

147
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,340
There's an RV park here at Fox Peak Station, and there's an RV park here at Eli.

148
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:59,340
This distance is 283 miles, and a Tesla's maximum range is 300 miles.

149
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,340
If I get stranded along this road, it's going to be a real problem.

150
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,340
So, in order to make this work, Fox Peak equals 100% charge.

151
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,340
I cannot leave Fox Peak with less than a completely full battery.

152
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Otherwise, I might not make it, and there is nothing out here.

153
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,340
So that's the plan.

154
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:26,340
It's 6.30 in the morning. I'm happy to have woken up and get started early, because today might be the longest day of driving.

155
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,340
But of course, before we can get started, navigate to the nearest Starbucks.

156
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:39,340
There's nothing cozier than being in a snowy world in a warm car on your way to get some coffee.

157
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,340
Sounds like a coffee emergency, whatever that was.

158
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:56,340
I was talking to the barista at Starbucks, and she said that this kind of snow in June is something she's only seen four times in the 20 years she's lived here.

159
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,340
So, I was feeling like the luckiest man alive yesterday, and now I feel just twice as lucky that I get to see this.

160
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,340
Reno on the horizon.

161
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,340
Ooh, it's still pretty cold out here.

162
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
Alright, let's go inside this casino.

163
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Boy, I sure hope I don't miss what's on this channel.

164
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,340
It's a buffet reimagined.

165
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,340
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna need two, both with bacon, egg, and cheese.

166
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,340
I don't know why I said egg. Of course there's egg in it, yeah. No, bacon and cheese, yeah.

167
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,340
Two, please.

168
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Hahaha, I'm not really two people though, am I?

169
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Second coffee acquired, because we all know the first coffee is a warm-up.

170
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,340
And now we're on to Fallon.

171
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:22,340
This place is the test, where we find out if I can do the route I want or not.

172
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,340
Uh, oh, Fox Peak, not Pizza Hut. Fox Peak Station.

173
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,340
This is the moment of truth.

174
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Let's see what we have here.

175
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,340
I'm thinking that this part doesn't go into that part, and I have no other adapters that can bridge the gap.

176
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,340
This thing has the same thing, so what I need to do is plug that.

177
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,340
Come on, baby. Alright, you're gonna get one there.

178
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,340
Yes, I need my credit card for like the 70th time. Authorizing, authorizing.

179
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
Hey, alright.

180
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,340
Oh my god, it's a miracle. Oh, it's gonna take a long time.

181
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,340
Sitting here with the Tesla, getting it charged for the next leg of the journey.

182
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,340
Uh, it's a little pooped. I'm a little pooped.

183
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:21,340
I'm also a bit coffeed out, so I'm going to get some of my replacement coffee pills, which are nice, and have some of that.

184
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:28,340
And then I think I'll show you, while I wait, a couple of the features of this Tesla.

185
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,340
Fighter jets from the Air Force Base. So loud.

186
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Alright, the number one thing I worried about before driving the Tesla was this a ginormous screen and how distracting it would be.

187
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I mean, it is huge, but it handles really well.

188
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,340
So when you hit the navigation, right, so I'm going to navigate, I want to get to Eli, Nevada.

189
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,340
What it'll do, and it would fill in if we had any kind of internet connection,

190
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,340
it'll show an overview of your route if you want, or it'll show a particular leg, like to the next supercharger.

191
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,340
But it doesn't actually really tell you how to drive here.

192
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:10,340
That is through the steering wheel on this little screen.

193
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,340
So you don't have to be looking at this gigantic screen over here to see where you're supposed to turn.

194
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Instead, the turn-by-turn directions are right here, and when you're driving, it's exactly in your field of view.

195
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,340
I feel like this is precisely where I want to be looking to see the turn-by-turn directions, so thumbs up for that.

196
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:35,340
There's a bunch of other stuff that you can do with the screen, but what I like is the rearview mirror doesn't give you a huge field of view here, but it doesn't matter.

197
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Because here, there's a button for the camera, so you can hit a rearview camera, and that shows you what's behind the car.

198
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:51,340
And then you can take these two windows and say, swap them, so that your overview of your trip is up here,

199
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,340
your rearview mirror is here, and you can even fullscreen this a little bit more,

200
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,340
so it's as big as it can possibly be, and I like this setup for driving.

201
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Okay, let's take a look at the car. You have this little magic key fob.

202
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,340
When you get close, the car recognizes you're coming by, so it starts turning on, the mirror folds out,

203
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,340
you can press the door, and the door opens up automatically, which is super nice.

204
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,340
A thing that I thought was a total gimmick, but I love it, is when you get in the car,

205
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,340
when you press the brake, the side door closes automatically.

206
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,340
This is a Belkin something or other, one star, do not recommend.

207
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,340
This wire, though, connects back to, there's a little nice dash space,

208
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
where you can plug in a traditional cigarette lighter.

209
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,340
It also has two USB-A ports, which is charging my laptop, actually, from the battery of the car,

210
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,340
and another wire, which is going up to the dash cam that I have set up, so that you can see what's going on on this road trip.

211
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,340
From inside the car, you can actually control the doors as well,

212
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,340
so you can say that you want the driver door open and the passenger door open, and they'll just go.

213
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Alright, let's get out to watch the impressive thing that everybody likes,

214
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,340
which is the amazing Falcon wing doors on this thing.

215
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Apparently, in the settings, they have some auto-height features that will open up higher or lower based on the space that you're in.

216
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
The trunk of the car also goes up.

217
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,340
These are all the wires and adapters I was messing around with before to actually charge the Tesla.

218
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
They come in this nice little case.

219
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,340
Obviously, on this road trip, I'm not carrying around one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people,

220
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
so instead I have these seats go flat.

221
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
There's a little button on the top here you press.

222
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,340
When you press it, the head pops down.

223
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,340
You can then fold the whole thing flat, so it gives you just a ton of space.

224
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Alright, that's the trunk. Let's go around to the frunk.

225
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,340
We can take a look at the engine inside. It's pretty awesome.

226
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,340
LOL. No engine, of course, because this is a Tesla,

227
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,340
so we don't need all that disgusting, fluid-y, engine-y stuff that your grandpa knows how to fix,

228
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,340
but you don't really care about. There's nothing in here.

229
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,340
The whole car is really just the wheelbase, the other wheelbase,

230
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,340
and a big battery that connects the two of them with some electrical engines that spin both of the wheels.

231
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,340
But everything above that is just car.

232
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
So now with all that space, you may be asking yourself,

233
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,340
Bray, I haven't seen any suitcases on this trip.

234
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,340
I haven't seen any luggage, you know, the kind of stuff that you'd need for a big old road trip.

235
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Like, this car is pretty empty.

236
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Because there's no traditional car stuff taking all the space, there's space everywhere,

237
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,340
including right here in the back, there's a panel that you can pull up,

238
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,340
and here is where I've actually hidden all of the stuff that I've packed.

239
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,340
I like it to look like I'm not carrying all my possessions in the car.

240
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,340
The only other thing then are these cup holders.

241
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,340
I don't know if it's the way I fit in a car or what,

242
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,340
but this cup holder is impossible for me to reach.

243
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,340
I have to move my arm all the way back behind the seat

244
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,340
to then move it forward to be able to get the drink and up.

245
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,340
Like, my elbow naturally goes exactly where this cup holder is.

246
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,340
There should be a cup holder here, or there should be a cup holder here,

247
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
but this spot...

248
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,340
That spot is no bueno for a cup holder.

249
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Alright, that's everything. It's time to pack it up and figure out what we're doing.

250
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,340
God, those doggies have a bed at the front of the RV.

251
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Those must be the happiest doggies in the world.

252
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Yeah, good doggo!

253
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Okay, I think I've been sitting here long enough.

254
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Now, I know past me said something like,

255
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I cannot leave Fox Peak with less than a completely full battery.

256
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
But you know what? I'm not obligated to that guy.

257
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
He's not here right now.

258
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,340
I've discovered something. I don't need to go to Eli.

259
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,340
I can go to a place called Austin in the middle.

260
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,340
There's an RV park in Austin that if I can get there,

261
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
they have a 50 amp charger.

262
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,340
Now, hopefully I have the right accessories to be able to make that work,

263
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,340
but I have a 20% margin of error to make it to Austin

264
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,340
to be able to charge, and I'm in a dice-rolling kind of mood.

265
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,340
I didn't come across the goddamn ocean to drive on a road I've already driven,

266
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
or to sit at a gas station for another three hours.

267
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
It's time to get out of here and go get possibly stranded in the desert.

268
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
What's the worst that can happen?

269
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Well, death. Death is always the worst that can happen.

270
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
Okay, I actually spent the next 15 minutes finding every single setting

271
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,340
in the settings panel that I could flip to make energy savings

272
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,340
the maximum amount possible and get the cabin pre-cooled

273
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
to save energy on air conditioning as well,

274
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
so I didn't just bolt out of here.

275
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
I spent a long time being fussy about things.

276
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
But now it's time to go.

277
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,340
Alright, we're on the road.

278
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
There's a bunch of stuff that I can possibly do to extend the range just a little bit,

279
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,340
and so far so good. We're up 1%.

280
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,340
I'm sure that I'll read 100 by the time we get there if trends continue,

281
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
so I'm feeling pretty great.

282
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,340
Here we are together on the loneliest road in America.

283
00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:19,340
We're about halfway to Austin, which is about halfway along my journey

284
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,340
of this section of the loneliest road.

285
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,340
We're estimating at 16% upon arrival in Austin, which is pretty good.

286
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
I think this was a good decision.

287
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,340
I think we're gonna make it.

288
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,340
Bailey Blue just popped up this alert.

289
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,340
She's getting concerned that we're too far from all the superchargers.

290
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
And I don't blame her.

291
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,340
We are smack dab in the middle of a supercharger desert.

292
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,340
Don't worry, you got me through those mountains.

293
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
I'll get you through this desert of electricity.

294
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
I hope.

295
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
I hope.

296
00:25:45,340 --> 00:26:12,340
We've officially reached Austin city limits, and holy hell am I relieved.

297
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,340
Hello, Austin Community Services. Boy, am I glad to see you.

298
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Now it's time to try and find the Pony Express RV camp.

299
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Pony Express, or is that the next one down?

300
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
Okay, great. Thank you very much, man.

301
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
Oh my god, I'm so excited to be here.

302
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Cold mine. That is what I'm looking for.

303
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
50 amp deliciousness.

304
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,340
This is the moment of truth, really.

305
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Because if this doesn't work, I am kind of f***ed.

306
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,340
All right, you and you should go together.

307
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,340
Let's flip.

308
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
Okay.

309
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,340
Oh, that looks sketchy.

310
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Awesome. Okay, fantastic.

311
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
We've at least got electricity.

312
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
We've got 40 amps.

313
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,340
So now I guess the question is to see if I can find a hotel where I can stay.

314
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
And there's one possibility here.

315
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Which is, there's a hotel up the road.

316
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,340
We've got some keys and a toasty warm room, which I am super happy to have.

317
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I am ridiculously unprepared for this weather.

318
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
I thought I was driving into the desert.

319
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
Oh my god, so warm.

320
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
Thank you, heater.

321
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Thank you, door.

322
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
Thank you, desk.

323
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
Thank you, microwave.

324
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:08,340
So I realized yesterday that I had dramatically underestimated how much storage space I was going to need running all of these cameras.

325
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,340
And of course, right now I have files that exist only on the dashcams, and that's just one copy.

326
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
And one copy is none copy, so I have to get two copies.

327
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
So I need to copy it to something else.

328
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
When I copy it to something else, I need to...

329
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
No one cares. No one cares about your technical problems.

330
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Ugh, I need some coffee.

331
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
Hello?

332
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
Hello?

333
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
Uh, okay.

334
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
After a night on the charger, we're all set.

335
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,340
Go, substitute coffee, go.

336
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
I need you.

337
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Great.

338
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
Thank you, town of Austin.

339
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
Now it's on to Eli.

340
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Supercharger desert.

341
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
And there's more to go.

342
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:25,340
I normally wear contacts when I'm driving, but my eyes are bothering me, so I'm back to my glasses.

343
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:36,340
But it is a driving into the sun morning, so I'm going to be pulling the super cool look of shades on top of prescription glasses.

344
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,340
I have never been, I think, on a longer, more isolated road than this.

345
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:57,340
I was worried about taking the Tesla where no Tesla is supposed to be, but this is a lifetime experience.

346
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,340
First real coffee of the day acquired.

347
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,340
At a lovely little cafe in Eureka. Man, I wish I had more time to explore this town.

348
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I'm gonna be late enough for Moab as it is, so I gotta get going.

349
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,340
And the danger of stopping anywhere with a beautiful Bailey Blue Tesla is that everybody wants to talk about it.

350
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,340
So expect Tesla conversation-related delays wherever you go.

351
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,340
Now we just need to find a place to hook up and pay.

352
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Oh, sweet.

353
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Man, that never gets old.

354
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Okay, the nice woman at the casino set me up with a license to park and a place to work in the hotel with internet.

355
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,340
Internets are few and far between here, and I need to download some work files.

356
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,340
If you listen to my podcast, you'll know that I like to use code names for my projects.

357
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,340
This summer is Ursus, so there's little statues calling to me.

358
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,340
If you're ever on the loneliest road, come see the bear. The first grade point.

359
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,340
And I wish I had more time to explore the town because it looks like there's a ton of interesting stuff here.

360
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,340
But once again, if I'm gonna get to Moab on time, I really need to get going.

361
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Oh, hello. Hello. Oh my god, hello.

362
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Somebody talked to me. Somebody knew.

363
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
What's her name? Her name is Tinkerbell.

364
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Oh, hello, Tinkerbell.

365
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,340
This never gets old as you press the button.

366
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Click.

367
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,340
The whole thing.

368
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:04,340
I'm listening to the episode of Cortex that we recorded back at WWDC for any final changes that need to be made.

369
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,340
And then if I ever have internet again, I will give the all okay for it to be posted.

370
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
We've made it to Deseret.

371
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,340
It didn't take long for Deseret to start looking like Deseret.

372
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:29,340
If you do drive in the west, make sure to get red-tinted sunglasses. It makes the whole experience better.

373
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,340
Not that this isn't beautiful, but upping the saturation sure doesn't hurt.

374
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:45,340
We're coming up on the town of Delta, which should have the last RV park for the loneliest road section of this trip.

375
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,340
I see RVs. Oh-ho-ho-ho.

376
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Man, this is the nicest looking RV park I've seen yet.

377
00:32:53,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Proper spaces, grass. Let's just see, do they have what I need? Oh, f**k.

378
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Double f**k.

379
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Alright, moment of truth.

380
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Yes!

381
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,340
Flip the switch. Green, green, green, green. Yes!

382
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Alright, fantastic.

383
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Alright, Bailey Blue isn't the only one that needs some power.

384
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
It's dinner time.

385
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
It's dinner time.

386
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
So an interesting thing has happened.

387
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:55,340
Now that I'm here, there's a supercharger up here in Nafidi, Utah that I've never noticed before or I swear to God is brand new.

388
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
It wasn't there when I was looking at the routes a couple days ago.

389
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,340
I was thinking I needed to go to a supercharger down here, which would have been way out of the way.

390
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,340
But this one says I can make it there with 8% remaining.

391
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Given all of this, it means that since I have reached the edge of the loneliest road in America and I am off the supercharger desert,

392
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,340
I can make it to a supercharger and make it to Moab tonight.

393
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Every gamble on this trip so far has worked out amazingly, so I'm going to roll the dice one last time.

394
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Daylight's burning, we've got to roll. Thank you Antelope RV Park in Delta.

395
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,340
You are the reason I might make it to Moab tonight.

396
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
Alright, I've got to put down the camera and we've got to go.

397
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
28 miles to spare.

398
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:58,340
Looks like we're topping out at around 270 miles per hour that we sit at the charger.

399
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Superchargers, I feel like I really appreciate you after the loneliest road.

400
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,340
It was too easy at the beginning, but now I understand just how great you are.

401
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Going to be 50 minutes here before we can move on to Green River.

402
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,340
I've got to say, I'm feeling pretty great just to be back on the supercharger network.

403
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,340
I feel like that's already quite an accomplishment.

404
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
So I don't know, maybe I'll charge up and...

405
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
Ooh, it's a truck train.

406
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Okay, the hell with it. The sun's going down, but you know what?

407
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,340
I don't want to be showing up late tomorrow. I'd rather get there tonight.

408
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Time for Tesla after dark. Let's do this.

409
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Let's do this.

410
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Green River or bust?

411
00:36:46,340 --> 00:37:00,340
So I made a bad assumption that there were going to be lights all over this highway, and there are not.

412
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,340
I think I would have not done this if I had realized it was going to be in total darkness for 100 miles.

413
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Umm, 83 miles to go.

414
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:20,340
Holy f***, am I glad to be off that highway.

415
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Alright, I thought the most stressful driving was going to be that snow, but boy was I wrong.

416
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,340
I am literally shaking.

417
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,340
Just 20 minutes to kill while she's charging.

418
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Okay, I'm full of adrenaline and nerves. I'm just going to walk around for a minute and shake it off.

419
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
I guess this is the eponymous Green River.

420
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
Alright, let's get back inside here.

421
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Thank you John Wesley Powell History Museum for installing those Tesla chargers.

422
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Alright, just a tiny bit longer until Moab, and then we're done for the night.

423
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:12,340
Nope, I'm going to stop it here. I can't show you any more fast forwarded footage with fun music underneath it.

424
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,340
This was a dumb dangerous decision at the end of a long series of dumb dangerous decisions.

425
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:27,340
I've been driving since Austin. I should have stopped at the RV park, I should have stopped at the supercharger, I definitely should have stopped at Green River, but I didn't.

426
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,340
This is how catastrophic errors happen, and I just got really lucky.

427
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,340
I will never do this again. Please go to bed if you're driving. Nothing is that important.

428
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
So I'm going to skip past all this now.

429
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,340
Alright, I can find you.

430
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,340
It's hard to get that spot, isn't it?

431
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Alright, I'll be back later.

432
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:37,340
Okay, so while I was out here, Tesla literally announced the next version of their autopilot system with a ton of improvements, including more sensors, on ramp, off ramp ability,

433
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:43,340
better ability to hold tight the lanes and take turns and smart summon and a whole bunch of other stuff.

434
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:50,340
This is one of the things that I love about technology because technology involves the promise of constant iteration and improvement,

435
00:39:51,340 --> 00:40:03,340
and it is the reason why I have just never cared about cars at all, but I've been really interested in Tesla since I first heard about them because it seems to me much less a car than a computer on wheels.

436
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,340
So I'm going to take you to the world.

437
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,340
Yeah, I'm going to love you.

438
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,340
I'll give you the world of what I've got.

439
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Fast and fast, baby, I have not.

440
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
I'm just going to love you.

441
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,340
Yeah, I'm going to love you.

442
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
I'm going to love you, baby.

443
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,340
Cross my heart and hope you die.

444
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,340
I'm going to love you.

445
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
I'm going to love you.

446
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:48,340
This ceiling is really low. I can't actually stand up in this place.

447
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Oh, God.

448
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,340
Oh, yeah, that's not creepy at all.

449
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Oh, God.

450
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Yeah, nope.

451
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Nope, nope.

452
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
Nope.

453
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Watch the hell out for that.

454
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:36,340
What makes it ten times creepier is it certainly seems like a ghost town, except there are a lot of these pretty shiny new no trespassing signs around.

455
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,340
There's a post office.

456
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
Which is, I'm going to guess, actually locked.

457
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
Yeah, see, so that's actually locked.

458
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
There's this new looking sign.

459
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Smile, you're on camera.

460
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,340
A security camera that sure looks like it's active.

461
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Oh, Jesus Christ.

462
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Not going to lie, I'm kind of terrified to open this.

463
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
Jesus Christ.

464
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,340
This thing looks like a puzzle out of mist.

465
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
Well, I do actually have to go.

466
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,340
Wait, don't drop your phone down the toilet this time.

467
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,340
If you say so.

468
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
Well.

469
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Time to go now, I think.

470
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:56,340
Cars do feel a bit like a bubble of security and safety that you can take with you wherever you go.

471
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:05,340
And I'm glad I came out to this ghost town, but the feeling like there are people around is creepy as all hell.

472
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:15,340
So I'm very happy to head back to that bubble of safety and security and get back to Moab.

473
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,340
In the car, lock the door.

474
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
Goodbye, Cisco.

475
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:38,340
I've been in Moab for a few days getting work done, getting podcast recording done.

476
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,340
All of my equipment is different and new. It's like, oh, Jesus Christ, fingers crossed.

477
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,340
Planning and preparing for the final and hardest part of this summer.

478
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,340
Which is VidCon. Not looking forward to that.

479
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:05,340
But also, and again, taking advantage of this unique and austerely beautiful part of the country.

480
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Driving through the West is like nothing else.

481
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
This trip has been just what I needed.

482
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,340
Driving with Bailey, especially through some unexpected difficulties.

483
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,340
I've gotten over a lot of the fear and hesitation I had about driving.

484
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,340
I'm really appreciative for that.

485
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,340
This is my final day in Moab.

486
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,340
So I'm going to take the time to appreciate it too before I have to drive to L.A.

487
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,340
Got my coffee, got my music.

488
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,340
Now just four stops left until I have to be in L.A. and at VidCon.

489
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,340
But no need to dwell. Moab, I'll see you again soon.

490
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,340
Bailey, let's enjoy the last of the desert driving.

491
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,340
This is the entrance to the San Rafael Swell.

492
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:07,340
Alright Bailey, I know that our time together is growing short.

493
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,340
But I'm glad that I get to take you through one of my favorite sections of Interstate.

494
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,340
Let's do this girl.

495
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,340
We'll be right back.

496
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:47,340
Las Vegas Boulevard.

497
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,340
Oh man.

498
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:30,340
That is some serious solar paneling.

499
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,340
It's Factorio.

500
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,340
Man, I want that upgrade.

501
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,340
It's time to be agriculturally inspected.

502
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,340
This was the last charging pit stop for Bailey.

503
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,340
Not going to lie, I am getting pretty emotional about saying goodbye to this girl.

504
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,340
I feel like we've been through a lot together.

505
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,340
We've had a fun romp through the desert.

506
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,340
But I think we've got to clean you back up before you go back to your normal life.

507
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,340
The works of course. Only the best for Bailey.

508
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,340
I know you don't want a bath.

509
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
You'll be happy to be clean.

510
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,340
You know, you'll be glad to be back home once you're there.

511
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
See, doesn't that feel good?

512
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,340
Look how good you look.

513
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,340
Alright girl, let's get me to VidCon and you home.

514
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,340
Thank you.

515
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:21,340
We're almost there Bailey Blue. Almost there.

516
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,340
You're welcome.
