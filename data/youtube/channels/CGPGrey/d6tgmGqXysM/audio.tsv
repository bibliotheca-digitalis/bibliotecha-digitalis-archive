0	7040	This is my dad's Tesla and I'm going to take it driving on the deadliest road in America.
7040	12960	But I'm not going to be driving because I've just installed the full self-driving
12960	15200	pre-release beta software.
16160	21440	It's only allowed right now on a tiny number of cars for testing in urban environments,
21440	27120	so of course I wanted to try it out on a famously dangerous mountain road
27120	29200	to see what it can really do.
29200	30400	Will I survive?
30400	34080	Will I crash my dad's car and be in big trouble?
34080	35760	Right now, I don't know.
35760	39040	But either way, it's road trip time.
57680	58960	You deserve a real name.
58960	59520	Winter.
59520	60320	Welcome to the world.
60880	61760	So where are we?
61760	65600	In the Great Smoky Mountains on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee,
65600	70480	where lies a mountain pass of some of the most twisty and dangerous driving in the country.
70480	72960	Just hours after we arrived, this happened.
72960	76240	Parts from accidents like these are salvaged to build the Tree of Shame
76240	79840	at the entrance to serve as warning to others of what can go wrong.
79840	80960	But here's the thing.
80960	85520	Driving hundreds of curves faster than you should on a mountain's edge, it's a lot of fun.
85520	88560	Name it the Tale of the Dragon, and the drivers will come.
101520	104400	I don't have any idea what this is, but it's adorable.
104400	118160	I did not understand just how dangerous this was until now.
118160	121600	The nearest hospital is an hour away, so on busy days like this,
121600	124960	an ambulance waits for the inevitable at the exit to save time.
124960	127600	But ambulances are not immune from accidents.
127600	131760	Off hours is when drivers push the limits, when they hope no one is around.
131760	133920	Going over the speed limit to break records,
133920	137360	crossing yellow lines and rounding blind turns with sheer drops.
137360	141840	Trucks are banned from the road for being too great a risk, but signs don't stop everyone.
143520	145600	The police were waiting for him down the road.
145600	149760	The dragon has killed multiple people along every one of its 11 miles.
149760	152240	It's a challenge for even the best human drivers,
152240	155360	but I'm putting my life in the hands of a non-human driver.
155360	158240	Ugh, I am having some serious doubts about this.
158240	161920	On the drive up, I had to disengage the beta autopilot several times,
161920	165680	and last night while doomscrolling dragon accident videos,
165680	170080	I found the last guy who tried the old Tesla autopilot on this road,
170080	175200	and he had to disengage minutes in because it was way too dangerous.
175200	179920	I am not confident she's going to make this run without me having to disengage and take over,
179920	182160	but I guess that's the whole point, right?
182160	185440	Beta testing the robot with my life.
185440	186720	Okay, here we go.
186720	190880	I'm going to put her in full self-driving beta mode,
190880	192960	and I'm going to have my hands on the wheel,
192960	196160	but let the wheels slide through them so that you can see
196160	199200	that it's really the Tesla doing it herself.
199200	204560	All right, motorcycle high crash area, and this is the official start.
204560	205120	Here we go.
209280	210000	Oh boy.
212160	215200	Also, I'm not doing any of the speed adjusting around these turns.
215920	218400	She's deciding entirely how slow to take the corners.
223280	225120	So I'm making left-hand turns.
225120	227520	The Tesla's just too close to the line.
227520	231280	I wish there was a way I could tell her stay as close to the white line as possible,
231280	233760	which she's doing now just fine on the right-hand turn,
233760	237760	but on the left-hand turns, it's a little dicier.
237760	242240	The one thing that's very helpful though is I can really look much further down the road
242240	246960	than I could if I had to also be keeping my eyes fully on the turn ahead,
246960	250560	so I am very alert for traffic coming the other way.
272240	282560	So
302240	314400	oh my god, oh my god, it's over.
315520	317200	She did the whole road all by herself.
320000	320800	Amazing.
324960	327840	She made it all the way by herself.
328960	332000	Zero disengagements the entire time.
332000	333120	Oh, I'm so pumped.
334400	338400	All right, now it's time to turn around and go back.
348960	350160	That's hilarious.
350160	351760	She's stopping for the photographer.
351760	354160	Winter, I didn't know you were a bit of a vain girl.
356560	357440	Okay, this is it.
357440	358480	This is the start.
358480	360880	This is the official start of the Dragon's Tale.
360880	362800	Autopilot has brought us to our destination.
362800	364720	I'm gonna pop into the general store.
364720	366560	Well, I've got to get one for Winter.
366560	368400	She totally deserves it.
368400	369680	I've got something for you.
372240	374000	She did the whole route all by herself.
374000	375520	It's still a very Beta Beta,
375520	384720	but this self-driving test made it up and down the dragon with zero human intervention.
