00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
This is my dad's Tesla and I'm going to take it driving on the deadliest road in America.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.960
But I'm not going to be driving because I've just installed the full self-driving

00:12.960 --> 00:15.200
pre-release beta software.

00:16.160 --> 00:21.440
It's only allowed right now on a tiny number of cars for testing in urban environments,

00:21.440 --> 00:27.120
so of course I wanted to try it out on a famously dangerous mountain road

00:27.120 --> 00:29.200
to see what it can really do.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.400
Will I survive?

00:30.400 --> 00:34.080
Will I crash my dad's car and be in big trouble?

00:34.080 --> 00:35.760
Right now, I don't know.

00:35.760 --> 00:39.040
But either way, it's road trip time.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.960
You deserve a real name.

00:58.960 --> 00:59.520
Winter.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.320
Welcome to the world.

01:00.880 --> 01:01.760
So where are we?

01:01.760 --> 01:05.600
In the Great Smoky Mountains on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee,

01:05.600 --> 01:10.480
where lies a mountain pass of some of the most twisty and dangerous driving in the country.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.960
Just hours after we arrived, this happened.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.240
Parts from accidents like these are salvaged to build the Tree of Shame

01:16.240 --> 01:19.840
at the entrance to serve as warning to others of what can go wrong.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.960
But here's the thing.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.520
Driving hundreds of curves faster than you should on a mountain's edge, it's a lot of fun.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.560
Name it the Tale of the Dragon, and the drivers will come.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.400
I don't have any idea what this is, but it's adorable.

01:44.400 --> 01:58.160
I did not understand just how dangerous this was until now.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.600
The nearest hospital is an hour away, so on busy days like this,

02:01.600 --> 02:04.960
an ambulance waits for the inevitable at the exit to save time.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.600
But ambulances are not immune from accidents.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.760
Off hours is when drivers push the limits, when they hope no one is around.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.920
Going over the speed limit to break records,

02:13.920 --> 02:17.360
crossing yellow lines and rounding blind turns with sheer drops.

02:17.360 --> 02:21.840
Trucks are banned from the road for being too great a risk, but signs don't stop everyone.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.600
The police were waiting for him down the road.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.760
The dragon has killed multiple people along every one of its 11 miles.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.240
It's a challenge for even the best human drivers,

02:32.240 --> 02:35.360
but I'm putting my life in the hands of a non-human driver.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.240
Ugh, I am having some serious doubts about this.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.920
On the drive up, I had to disengage the beta autopilot several times,

02:41.920 --> 02:45.680
and last night while doomscrolling dragon accident videos,

02:45.680 --> 02:50.080
I found the last guy who tried the old Tesla autopilot on this road,

02:50.080 --> 02:55.200
and he had to disengage minutes in because it was way too dangerous.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.920
I am not confident she's going to make this run without me having to disengage and take over,

02:59.920 --> 03:02.160
but I guess that's the whole point, right?

03:02.160 --> 03:05.440
Beta testing the robot with my life.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.720
Okay, here we go.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.880
I'm going to put her in full self-driving beta mode,

03:10.880 --> 03:12.960
and I'm going to have my hands on the wheel,

03:12.960 --> 03:16.160
but let the wheels slide through them so that you can see

03:16.160 --> 03:19.200
that it's really the Tesla doing it herself.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.560
All right, motorcycle high crash area, and this is the official start.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.120
Here we go.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.000
Oh boy.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.200
Also, I'm not doing any of the speed adjusting around these turns.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.400
She's deciding entirely how slow to take the corners.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.120
So I'm making left-hand turns.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.520
The Tesla's just too close to the line.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.280
I wish there was a way I could tell her stay as close to the white line as possible,

03:51.280 --> 03:53.760
which she's doing now just fine on the right-hand turn,

03:53.760 --> 03:57.760
but on the left-hand turns, it's a little dicier.

03:57.760 --> 04:02.240
The one thing that's very helpful though is I can really look much further down the road

04:02.240 --> 04:06.960
than I could if I had to also be keeping my eyes fully on the turn ahead,

04:06.960 --> 04:10.560
so I am very alert for traffic coming the other way.

04:32.240 --> 04:42.560
So

05:02.240 --> 05:14.400
oh my god, oh my god, it's over.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.200
She did the whole road all by herself.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.800
Amazing.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.840
She made it all the way by herself.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.000
Zero disengagements the entire time.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.120
Oh, I'm so pumped.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.400
All right, now it's time to turn around and go back.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.160
That's hilarious.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.760
She's stopping for the photographer.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.160
Winter, I didn't know you were a bit of a vain girl.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.440
Okay, this is it.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.480
This is the start.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.880
This is the official start of the Dragon's Tale.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.800
Autopilot has brought us to our destination.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.720
I'm gonna pop into the general store.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.560
Well, I've got to get one for Winter.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.400
She totally deserves it.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.680
I've got something for you.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.000
She did the whole route all by herself.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.520
It's still a very Beta Beta,

06:15.520 --> 06:24.720
but this self-driving test made it up and down the dragon with zero human intervention.
