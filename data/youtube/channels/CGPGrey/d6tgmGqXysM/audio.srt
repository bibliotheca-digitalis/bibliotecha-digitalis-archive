1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
This is my dad's Tesla and I'm going to take it driving on the deadliest road in America.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,960
But I'm not going to be driving because I've just installed the full self-driving

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
pre-release beta software.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,440
It's only allowed right now on a tiny number of cars for testing in urban environments,

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,120
so of course I wanted to try it out on a famously dangerous mountain road

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,200
to see what it can really do.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Will I survive?

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,080
Will I crash my dad's car and be in big trouble?

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,760
Right now, I don't know.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
But either way, it's road trip time.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
You deserve a real name.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,520
Winter.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Welcome to the world.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,760
So where are we?

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,600
In the Great Smoky Mountains on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee,

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,480
where lies a mountain pass of some of the most twisty and dangerous driving in the country.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,960
Just hours after we arrived, this happened.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
Parts from accidents like these are salvaged to build the Tree of Shame

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
at the entrance to serve as warning to others of what can go wrong.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,960
But here's the thing.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Driving hundreds of curves faster than you should on a mountain's edge, it's a lot of fun.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,560
Name it the Tale of the Dragon, and the drivers will come.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,400
I don't have any idea what this is, but it's adorable.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:58,160
I did not understand just how dangerous this was until now.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,600
The nearest hospital is an hour away, so on busy days like this,

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,960
an ambulance waits for the inevitable at the exit to save time.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
But ambulances are not immune from accidents.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,760
Off hours is when drivers push the limits, when they hope no one is around.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
Going over the speed limit to break records,

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
crossing yellow lines and rounding blind turns with sheer drops.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,840
Trucks are banned from the road for being too great a risk, but signs don't stop everyone.

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,600
The police were waiting for him down the road.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,760
The dragon has killed multiple people along every one of its 11 miles.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,240
It's a challenge for even the best human drivers,

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,360
but I'm putting my life in the hands of a non-human driver.

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,240
Ugh, I am having some serious doubts about this.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,920
On the drive up, I had to disengage the beta autopilot several times,

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
and last night while doomscrolling dragon accident videos,

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,080
I found the last guy who tried the old Tesla autopilot on this road,

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
and he had to disengage minutes in because it was way too dangerous.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,920
I am not confident she's going to make this run without me having to disengage and take over,

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,160
but I guess that's the whole point, right?

43
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,440
Beta testing the robot with my life.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
Okay, here we go.

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,880
I'm going to put her in full self-driving beta mode,

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,960
and I'm going to have my hands on the wheel,

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,160
but let the wheels slide through them so that you can see

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,200
that it's really the Tesla doing it herself.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,560
All right, motorcycle high crash area, and this is the official start.

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,120
Here we go.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh boy.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,200
Also, I'm not doing any of the speed adjusting around these turns.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
She's deciding entirely how slow to take the corners.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
So I'm making left-hand turns.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,520
The Tesla's just too close to the line.

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,280
I wish there was a way I could tell her stay as close to the white line as possible,

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
which she's doing now just fine on the right-hand turn,

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,760
but on the left-hand turns, it's a little dicier.

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,240
The one thing that's very helpful though is I can really look much further down the road

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,960
than I could if I had to also be keeping my eyes fully on the turn ahead,

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,560
so I am very alert for traffic coming the other way.

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:42,560
So

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:14,400
oh my god, oh my god, it's over.

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,200
She did the whole road all by herself.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Amazing.

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,840
She made it all the way by herself.

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,000
Zero disengagements the entire time.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh, I'm so pumped.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
All right, now it's time to turn around and go back.

70
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
That's hilarious.

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,760
She's stopping for the photographer.

72
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,160
Winter, I didn't know you were a bit of a vain girl.

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,440
Okay, this is it.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
This is the start.

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,880
This is the official start of the Dragon's Tale.

76
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
Autopilot has brought us to our destination.

77
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm gonna pop into the general store.

78
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
Well, I've got to get one for Winter.

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,400
She totally deserves it.

80
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,680
I've got something for you.

81
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
She did the whole route all by herself.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,520
It's still a very Beta Beta,

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:24,720
but this self-driving test made it up and down the dragon with zero human intervention.
