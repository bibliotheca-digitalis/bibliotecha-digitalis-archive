00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
Hello internet.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,060
The UK had an election we need to talk about because after the debates finished, the people

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,780
voted and the ballots tallied, the results were this.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,900
But parliament ended up looking like this, which isn't exactly representative and by

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,980
exactly I mean at all.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,620
Red earned 30% of the vote and 36% of the seats which is sort of close but the rest

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,940
is madness.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,220
Orange earned 8% of the vote but got one eighth of that while yellow's 5% just about doubled

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,260
and purple earned 13% and got squat.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,520
Meanwhile blue's 37% of the people boosted to 51% of the seats in parliament.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,960
The blue boost is even bigger when you consider that 51% of the seats gives you basically

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,800
100% of the control.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
How'd this happen?

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,520
In the UK, national elections aren't really national.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,040
They're a bunch of local elections.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,240
The UK is divided into constituencies, each of which elects one member of parliament,

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
MP, to represent them.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,980
This local-national divide is where the trouble begins.

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,240
Imagine a parliament with just three constituencies and it's easy to see how it wouldn't always

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,060
align with the citizens.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,420
Some people think this sort of result is fine.

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,860
It's all about winning local elections, they'll say.

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,320
Each MP represents their constituency.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,900
And while the imbalance in this example is extreme, it's the same problem in the real

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,140
election and the same argument is given but there are two more problems with it in reality

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,140
land.

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,940
First, few citizens have any idea who their MP is.

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,780
They just know what party they voted for, what party they want to represent their views

29
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,300
on the national level and pretending like it's a competition on the local level is a

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,780
bit disingenuous.

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,380
In practice, it's an election for how the nation will run, not really for who's going

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,420
to represent a tiny part of it.

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,100
And even if it were, the individual constituencies are worse at representing their citizens than

34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
parliament.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,440
Indulge this spreadsheet-loving nerd for a moment, will you?

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,680
The difference between what a party earned at the polls and what they got in parliament

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,580
is the amount of misrepresentation error.

38
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,660
If we calculate all the errors for all the parties and add them up, we can say that parliament

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,140
as a whole has a 47 percentage points of misrepresentation error.

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,580
That sounds bad but looks like a utopian rainbow of diversity compared to any local election

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,520
because the local elections have one winner.

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,100
Out of the 650 constituencies, 647 have a higher representation error than parliament.

43
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,980
These are the only three that don't and they're really unusual for having so many of a single

44
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,260
kind of voter in one place.

45
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,180
Most places look like The Reckon, which is dead in the middle, a mere 101 points off.

46
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,380
Note that the winning candidate here didn't reach a majority, which means more than half

47
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,460
of constituencies elected their MP with a minority of voters.

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,580
The worst is Belfast South at the bottom of the list, hilariously unrepresentative.

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,640
Less than a quarter of the voters get to speak for the entire place in parliament.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,140
This is the lowest percentage an MP has ever been elected by.

51
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,700
So when people argue that the UK election is a bunch of local elections, it's even more

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,260
of an argument that the elections are broken because they're worse on this level.

53
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,080
These elections are terrible because of the first-past-the-post voting system, which I

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,860
have complained mightily about and won't repeat everything here, go watch the video.

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,780
But TLDR, it only works when citizens are limited to two choices.

56
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,940
Voting for any party except the biggest makes it more likely the biggest will win by a minority,

57
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,080
which is exactly what happened.

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,140
That citizens keep voting for smaller parties despite knowing the result is against their

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,140
strategic interests demonstrates that citizenry wants diverse representation.

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,620
But that success is the very thing that has made this the most unrepresentative parliament

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,500
in the history of the UK.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Now people happy with the result argue that the system is working fine.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
Of course they do.

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,500
Their team won.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,120
But government isn't a sport where a singular winner must be determined.

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,140
It's a system to make rules that everyone follows, and so we need a system where everyone

67
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,040
can agree that the process is fair, even if they don't like all the rules.

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,280
If you support a system that disenfranchises people you don't like and turbo-franchises

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,000
people you do, then it doesn't look like you support representative democracy.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,800
It looks like you support a kind of dictatorship light, where a potentially small group of

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,860
people, including you, gets to make the rules for everyone else.

72
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,520
And as it is now, on election day, the more people express what they want, the worse the

73
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,080
system looks, which also makes them disengaged at best or angry at worst, and gee I can't

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,520
imagine why.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
This is fixable.

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,660
There are many, many better ways the UK could vote.

77
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,160
Here are two that even keep local representatives.

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,680
And fixing voting really matters, because this is a kind of government illegitimacy

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,000
score and it's been going up and may continue to do so unless this fundamentally broken

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
voting system is changed.
