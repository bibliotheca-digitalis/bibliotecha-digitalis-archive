0	1120	Hello internet.
1120	5060	The UK had an election we need to talk about because after the debates finished, the people
5060	7780	voted and the ballots tallied, the results were this.
7780	12900	But parliament ended up looking like this, which isn't exactly representative and by
12900	14980	exactly I mean at all.
14980	19620	Red earned 30% of the vote and 36% of the seats which is sort of close but the rest
19620	20940	is madness.
20940	25220	Orange earned 8% of the vote but got one eighth of that while yellow's 5% just about doubled
25220	28260	and purple earned 13% and got squat.
28260	33520	Meanwhile blue's 37% of the people boosted to 51% of the seats in parliament.
33520	37960	The blue boost is even bigger when you consider that 51% of the seats gives you basically
37960	39800	100% of the control.
39800	40800	How'd this happen?
40800	43520	In the UK, national elections aren't really national.
43520	45040	They're a bunch of local elections.
45040	49240	The UK is divided into constituencies, each of which elects one member of parliament,
49240	50960	MP, to represent them.
50960	53980	This local-national divide is where the trouble begins.
53980	58240	Imagine a parliament with just three constituencies and it's easy to see how it wouldn't always
58340	60060	align with the citizens.
60060	62420	Some people think this sort of result is fine.
62420	64860	It's all about winning local elections, they'll say.
64860	67320	Each MP represents their constituency.
67320	71900	And while the imbalance in this example is extreme, it's the same problem in the real
71900	77140	election and the same argument is given but there are two more problems with it in reality
77140	78140	land.
78140	80940	First, few citizens have any idea who their MP is.
80940	85780	They just know what party they voted for, what party they want to represent their views
85780	90300	on the national level and pretending like it's a competition on the local level is a
90300	91780	bit disingenuous.
91780	96380	In practice, it's an election for how the nation will run, not really for who's going
96380	98420	to represent a tiny part of it.
98420	103100	And even if it were, the individual constituencies are worse at representing their citizens than
103100	104100	parliament.
104100	106440	Indulge this spreadsheet-loving nerd for a moment, will you?
106440	109680	The difference between what a party earned at the polls and what they got in parliament
109680	112580	is the amount of misrepresentation error.
112580	116660	If we calculate all the errors for all the parties and add them up, we can say that parliament
116660	121140	as a whole has a 47 percentage points of misrepresentation error.
121140	126580	That sounds bad but looks like a utopian rainbow of diversity compared to any local election
126580	129520	because the local elections have one winner.
129520	138100	Out of the 650 constituencies, 647 have a higher representation error than parliament.
138100	143980	These are the only three that don't and they're really unusual for having so many of a single
143980	146260	kind of voter in one place.
146260	153180	Most places look like The Reckon, which is dead in the middle, a mere 101 points off.
153180	157380	Note that the winning candidate here didn't reach a majority, which means more than half
157380	161460	of constituencies elected their MP with a minority of voters.
161460	167580	The worst is Belfast South at the bottom of the list, hilariously unrepresentative.
167580	171640	Less than a quarter of the voters get to speak for the entire place in parliament.
171640	176140	This is the lowest percentage an MP has ever been elected by.
176140	180700	So when people argue that the UK election is a bunch of local elections, it's even more
180700	185260	of an argument that the elections are broken because they're worse on this level.
185260	189080	These elections are terrible because of the first-past-the-post voting system, which I
189080	192860	have complained mightily about and won't repeat everything here, go watch the video.
192860	196780	But TLDR, it only works when citizens are limited to two choices.
196780	201940	Voting for any party except the biggest makes it more likely the biggest will win by a minority,
201940	204080	which is exactly what happened.
204080	207140	That citizens keep voting for smaller parties despite knowing the result is against their
207140	211140	strategic interests demonstrates that citizenry wants diverse representation.
211140	216620	But that success is the very thing that has made this the most unrepresentative parliament
216620	218500	in the history of the UK.
218500	222000	Now people happy with the result argue that the system is working fine.
222000	223080	Of course they do.
223080	224500	Their team won.
224500	228120	But government isn't a sport where a singular winner must be determined.
228120	233140	It's a system to make rules that everyone follows, and so we need a system where everyone
233140	238040	can agree that the process is fair, even if they don't like all the rules.
238040	243280	If you support a system that disenfranchises people you don't like and turbo-franchises
243280	248000	people you do, then it doesn't look like you support representative democracy.
248000	252800	It looks like you support a kind of dictatorship light, where a potentially small group of
252800	256860	people, including you, gets to make the rules for everyone else.
256860	262520	And as it is now, on election day, the more people express what they want, the worse the
262520	269080	system looks, which also makes them disengaged at best or angry at worst, and gee I can't
269080	270520	imagine why.
270520	271560	This is fixable.
271560	274660	There are many, many better ways the UK could vote.
274660	277160	Here are two that even keep local representatives.
277160	282680	And fixing voting really matters, because this is a kind of government illegitimacy
282680	288000	score and it's been going up and may continue to do so unless this fundamentally broken
288000	289720	voting system is changed.
