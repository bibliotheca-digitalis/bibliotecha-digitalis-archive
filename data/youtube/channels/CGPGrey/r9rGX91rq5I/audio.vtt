00:00.000 --> 00:01.120
Hello internet.

00:01.120 --> 00:05.060
The UK had an election we need to talk about because after the debates finished, the people

00:05.060 --> 00:07.780
voted and the ballots tallied, the results were this.

00:07.780 --> 00:12.900
But parliament ended up looking like this, which isn't exactly representative and by

00:12.900 --> 00:14.980
exactly I mean at all.

00:14.980 --> 00:19.620
Red earned 30% of the vote and 36% of the seats which is sort of close but the rest

00:19.620 --> 00:20.940
is madness.

00:20.940 --> 00:25.220
Orange earned 8% of the vote but got one eighth of that while yellow's 5% just about doubled

00:25.220 --> 00:28.260
and purple earned 13% and got squat.

00:28.260 --> 00:33.520
Meanwhile blue's 37% of the people boosted to 51% of the seats in parliament.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.960
The blue boost is even bigger when you consider that 51% of the seats gives you basically

00:37.960 --> 00:39.800
100% of the control.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
How'd this happen?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.520
In the UK, national elections aren't really national.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.040
They're a bunch of local elections.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.240
The UK is divided into constituencies, each of which elects one member of parliament,

00:49.240 --> 00:50.960
MP, to represent them.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.980
This local-national divide is where the trouble begins.

00:53.980 --> 00:58.240
Imagine a parliament with just three constituencies and it's easy to see how it wouldn't always

00:58.340 --> 01:00.060
align with the citizens.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.420
Some people think this sort of result is fine.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.860
It's all about winning local elections, they'll say.

01:04.860 --> 01:07.320
Each MP represents their constituency.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.900
And while the imbalance in this example is extreme, it's the same problem in the real

01:11.900 --> 01:17.140
election and the same argument is given but there are two more problems with it in reality

01:17.140 --> 01:18.140
land.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.940
First, few citizens have any idea who their MP is.

01:20.940 --> 01:25.780
They just know what party they voted for, what party they want to represent their views

01:25.780 --> 01:30.300
on the national level and pretending like it's a competition on the local level is a

01:30.300 --> 01:31.780
bit disingenuous.

01:31.780 --> 01:36.380
In practice, it's an election for how the nation will run, not really for who's going

01:36.380 --> 01:38.420
to represent a tiny part of it.

01:38.420 --> 01:43.100
And even if it were, the individual constituencies are worse at representing their citizens than

01:43.100 --> 01:44.100
parliament.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.440
Indulge this spreadsheet-loving nerd for a moment, will you?

01:46.440 --> 01:49.680
The difference between what a party earned at the polls and what they got in parliament

01:49.680 --> 01:52.580
is the amount of misrepresentation error.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.660
If we calculate all the errors for all the parties and add them up, we can say that parliament

01:56.660 --> 02:01.140
as a whole has a 47 percentage points of misrepresentation error.

02:01.140 --> 02:06.580
That sounds bad but looks like a utopian rainbow of diversity compared to any local election

02:06.580 --> 02:09.520
because the local elections have one winner.

02:09.520 --> 02:18.100
Out of the 650 constituencies, 647 have a higher representation error than parliament.

02:18.100 --> 02:23.980
These are the only three that don't and they're really unusual for having so many of a single

02:23.980 --> 02:26.260
kind of voter in one place.

02:26.260 --> 02:33.180
Most places look like The Reckon, which is dead in the middle, a mere 101 points off.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.380
Note that the winning candidate here didn't reach a majority, which means more than half

02:37.380 --> 02:41.460
of constituencies elected their MP with a minority of voters.

02:41.460 --> 02:47.580
The worst is Belfast South at the bottom of the list, hilariously unrepresentative.

02:47.580 --> 02:51.640
Less than a quarter of the voters get to speak for the entire place in parliament.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.140
This is the lowest percentage an MP has ever been elected by.

02:56.140 --> 03:00.700
So when people argue that the UK election is a bunch of local elections, it's even more

03:00.700 --> 03:05.260
of an argument that the elections are broken because they're worse on this level.

03:05.260 --> 03:09.080
These elections are terrible because of the first-past-the-post voting system, which I

03:09.080 --> 03:12.860
have complained mightily about and won't repeat everything here, go watch the video.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.780
But TLDR, it only works when citizens are limited to two choices.

03:16.780 --> 03:21.940
Voting for any party except the biggest makes it more likely the biggest will win by a minority,

03:21.940 --> 03:24.080
which is exactly what happened.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.140
That citizens keep voting for smaller parties despite knowing the result is against their

03:27.140 --> 03:31.140
strategic interests demonstrates that citizenry wants diverse representation.

03:31.140 --> 03:36.620
But that success is the very thing that has made this the most unrepresentative parliament

03:36.620 --> 03:38.500
in the history of the UK.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.000
Now people happy with the result argue that the system is working fine.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.080
Of course they do.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.500
Their team won.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.120
But government isn't a sport where a singular winner must be determined.

03:48.120 --> 03:53.140
It's a system to make rules that everyone follows, and so we need a system where everyone

03:53.140 --> 03:58.040
can agree that the process is fair, even if they don't like all the rules.

03:58.040 --> 04:03.280
If you support a system that disenfranchises people you don't like and turbo-franchises

04:03.280 --> 04:08.000
people you do, then it doesn't look like you support representative democracy.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.800
It looks like you support a kind of dictatorship light, where a potentially small group of

04:12.800 --> 04:16.860
people, including you, gets to make the rules for everyone else.

04:16.860 --> 04:22.520
And as it is now, on election day, the more people express what they want, the worse the

04:22.520 --> 04:29.080
system looks, which also makes them disengaged at best or angry at worst, and gee I can't

04:29.080 --> 04:30.520
imagine why.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.560
This is fixable.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.660
There are many, many better ways the UK could vote.

04:34.660 --> 04:37.160
Here are two that even keep local representatives.

04:37.160 --> 04:42.680
And fixing voting really matters, because this is a kind of government illegitimacy

04:42.680 --> 04:48.000
score and it's been going up and may continue to do so unless this fundamentally broken

04:48.000 --> 04:49.720
voting system is changed.
