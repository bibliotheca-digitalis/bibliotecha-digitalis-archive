1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Sheep weren't always this fluffy.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,660
We fluffified them by breeding the fluffiest in each generation.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,740
This is domestication, sculpting wild animals for better human use.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,960
As we saw in part 1, for early man, animals were powerful tools.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,580
Food, clothing, transportation, tractors.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,760
Yet though there were animals everywhere, only a handful were domesticated in the pre-modern

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
world.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,340
What made these different?

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,280
Let's make a domestication checklist, shall we?

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
First up, feedable.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,040
A cow is a machine that turns grass into steaks, and a tiger a machine that turns steaks

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,200
into tiger.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,660
Ten pounds of grass make a pound of steak, and ten pounds of steak make a pound of tiger.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,020
But these have the same number of calories, so you might as well just eat the cow and

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,840
save yourself a lot of work.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,420
So pure carnivores, you're not going to domesticate just because of thermodynamics.

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,280
You're looking for herbivores that aren't picky, they should eat something that's everywhere

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
that you can't eat.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,440
Many omnivores better be happy eating whatever, and better be super worth it.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,840
We are, however, putting the pig before the pen here, because first we need to catch something

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
that's friendly.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,780
Okay, obviously catching a carnivore is a bad idea anyway because their day job is murder,

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,360
but plenty of omnivores like Grizzly's Moonlight in murder.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,160
No safety in vegetarians either.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,460
Buffalo are terrifying tanks for all the reasons mentioned before, hippos hold the murder high

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,900
score in Africa, giraffes look real dorky until you consider their striking range, lions

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,980
mostly leave them alone.

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,340
Animals it would be awesome to domesticate are, not coincidentally, super dangerous.

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,900
War bears would be a hell of an advantage for your tribe, but it's not going to happen.

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,960
And if it's big and not dangerous, it's a nervous wreck.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,520
Try sneaking up on a gazelle?

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Rhymes with LOL.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,660
Sure, you and a team of buddies could spend the whole day marathon jogging it down to

34
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,140
exhaustion, but if it doesn't break its own neck as you try to drag it back home, then

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,820
it's going to casually leap out of whatever pen you built for it.

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Okay, next up.

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,620
Some animals have reproductive, uh, preferences that make them incompatible with captivity.

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,280
Looking at you, pandas.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,100
The time and energy humans have spent to get pandas to get on with it is comical.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,380
Hunter-gatherers need an animal so eager to breed it gets it wrong sometimes, not an animal

41
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,380
whose mating seasons they have to keep careful track of.

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,980
So friendly, feedable, and fecund, it also needs to grow up fast.

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,780
This gets us to the heart of domestication versus taming.

44
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,060
Again, to domesticate a species is to change it to make it better for us.

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,820
And side note here, we domesticate plants as well.

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,120
We've bred them to be monstrous versions of their wild selves.

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,940
So when hippies talk about going back to nature, they forget that these plants are just as

48
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,420
man-made as this pop-tart.

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,000
Anyway, back to the animals.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,620
The pig porkification project succeeded because pig generations are shorter than human generations.

51
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,620
A single clever human can make porky progress in their lifetime.

52
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,500
Compare and contrast elephants.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,020
Two years to make a calf, five years in between calves, nine years until female maturity,

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,220
fifteen years for males.

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,620
You've got to be kidding elephants, there's no time for this.

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,760
But humans can still tame elephants.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,260
You can catch an elephant and train it not to freak out around humans, then put it to

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
work.

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,020
But elephant domestication would require accurate records over several human lives.

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,660
Never mind that keeping one or two tamed elephants around is incredibly costly, which

61
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,700
is why war elephants only happened on occasion in already complex societies.

62
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,260
Tame elephants are a luxury, hence this rule of thumb.

63
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,380
If it's on a farm, it's domesticated.

64
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
If it's in a circus, it's tame.

65
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
Finally, families.

66
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,900
Okay, zebra versus horses.

67
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,980
Horses are civilization game changers.

68
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,820
It's remarkable to think that from thousands BC until the telegraph, a dude on a horse

69
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,160
was the best internet available.

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,020
Horses were domesticated in Eurasia, but humans started in Africa, which has zebra.

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,820
Why didn't the first humans ride out of Africa on the backs of zebra to conquer the world?

72
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,220
Because zebra are bastards.

73
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,020
They live to kick and bite, dangerous in a pre-penicillin world.

74
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,420
And zebra also have a ducking reflex, making them very frustrating to lasso.

75
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,260
In addition to being a real pain in the ass animal, zebra lack a family structure.

76
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,020
Horse herds hierarchy.

77
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,140
You can see it when they travel in a line.

78
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,120
The male, top female, her foal, second female, her foals, and so on.

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,980
Humans by capturing and taming the lead male become head horse.

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:26,200
Lots of barnyard animals are barnyard animals because they have family values humans exploit.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,700
They just grow up with the idea that this human is a funny sort of take charge cow or

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
whatever.

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
No big deal.

84
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,860
Chickens will peck peck peck until they've worked out who's top chicken.

85
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,940
But you know who's really top chicken?

86
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,220
We're top chicken.

87
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,480
Dogs and cats, this is what makes them different.

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,380
Dogs will love you and defend you and hunt with you because you're part of the pack.

89
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,540
Dogs live to be useful to us, which in the modern world means falling over to play dead,

90
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
but they love it.

91
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Bang.

92
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,580
Good girl, good girl.

93
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,260
Whereas a cat is a tiny tiger that lives in your house.

94
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,580
Okay, back to these guys.

95
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,780
For zebra, there's no such thing as society.

96
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,540
They hang out in groups because it's a good survival strategy, but they don't really care.

97
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,180
If you catch a zebra and his family won't follow, try to ride him and you'll be lucky

98
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,900
to keep your fingers.

99
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,580
Zebra look like horses on the outside, but not on the inside.

100
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
So that's the checklist.

101
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,100
Friendly, feedable, fecund, family friendly.

102
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,860
It's not a long checklist, but for hunter-gatherers, any animal they wanted to domesticate needed

103
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,900
everything.

104
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,460
Which is why in early human history, only a baker's dozen of big animals were domesticated

105
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
the world over.
