WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Sheep weren't always this fluffy.

00:02.320 --> 00:05.660
We fluffified them by breeding the fluffiest in each generation.

00:05.660 --> 00:09.740
This is domestication, sculpting wild animals for better human use.

00:09.740 --> 00:13.960
As we saw in part 1, for early man, animals were powerful tools.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.580
Food, clothing, transportation, tractors.

00:16.580 --> 00:21.760
Yet though there were animals everywhere, only a handful were domesticated in the pre-modern

00:21.760 --> 00:22.760
world.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.340
What made these different?

00:24.340 --> 00:26.280
Let's make a domestication checklist, shall we?

00:26.280 --> 00:27.280
First up, feedable.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.040
A cow is a machine that turns grass into steaks, and a tiger a machine that turns steaks

00:32.040 --> 00:33.200
into tiger.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.660
Ten pounds of grass make a pound of steak, and ten pounds of steak make a pound of tiger.

00:37.660 --> 00:42.020
But these have the same number of calories, so you might as well just eat the cow and

00:42.020 --> 00:43.840
save yourself a lot of work.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.420
So pure carnivores, you're not going to domesticate just because of thermodynamics.

00:48.420 --> 00:53.280
You're looking for herbivores that aren't picky, they should eat something that's everywhere

00:53.280 --> 00:54.800
that you can't eat.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.440
Many omnivores better be happy eating whatever, and better be super worth it.

00:58.440 --> 01:02.840
We are, however, putting the pig before the pen here, because first we need to catch something

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
that's friendly.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.780
Okay, obviously catching a carnivore is a bad idea anyway because their day job is murder,

01:08.780 --> 01:12.360
but plenty of omnivores like Grizzly's Moonlight in murder.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.160
No safety in vegetarians either.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.460
Buffalo are terrifying tanks for all the reasons mentioned before, hippos hold the murder high

01:18.460 --> 01:23.900
score in Africa, giraffes look real dorky until you consider their striking range, lions

01:23.900 --> 01:25.980
mostly leave them alone.

01:25.980 --> 01:31.340
Animals it would be awesome to domesticate are, not coincidentally, super dangerous.

01:31.340 --> 01:35.900
War bears would be a hell of an advantage for your tribe, but it's not going to happen.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.960
And if it's big and not dangerous, it's a nervous wreck.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.520
Try sneaking up on a gazelle?

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
Rhymes with LOL.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.660
Sure, you and a team of buddies could spend the whole day marathon jogging it down to

01:45.660 --> 01:49.140
exhaustion, but if it doesn't break its own neck as you try to drag it back home, then

01:49.140 --> 01:52.820
it's going to casually leap out of whatever pen you built for it.

01:52.820 --> 01:53.820
Okay, next up.

01:53.820 --> 01:59.620
Some animals have reproductive, uh, preferences that make them incompatible with captivity.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.280
Looking at you, pandas.

02:01.280 --> 02:06.100
The time and energy humans have spent to get pandas to get on with it is comical.

02:06.100 --> 02:11.380
Hunter-gatherers need an animal so eager to breed it gets it wrong sometimes, not an animal

02:11.380 --> 02:14.380
whose mating seasons they have to keep careful track of.

02:14.380 --> 02:19.980
So friendly, feedable, and fecund, it also needs to grow up fast.

02:19.980 --> 02:22.780
This gets us to the heart of domestication versus taming.

02:22.780 --> 02:27.060
Again, to domesticate a species is to change it to make it better for us.

02:27.060 --> 02:29.820
And side note here, we domesticate plants as well.

02:29.820 --> 02:34.120
We've bred them to be monstrous versions of their wild selves.

02:34.120 --> 02:38.940
So when hippies talk about going back to nature, they forget that these plants are just as

02:38.940 --> 02:40.420
man-made as this pop-tart.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.000
Anyway, back to the animals.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.620
The pig porkification project succeeded because pig generations are shorter than human generations.

02:46.620 --> 02:50.620
A single clever human can make porky progress in their lifetime.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.500
Compare and contrast elephants.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.020
Two years to make a calf, five years in between calves, nine years until female maturity,

02:58.020 --> 03:00.220
fifteen years for males.

03:00.220 --> 03:02.620
You've got to be kidding elephants, there's no time for this.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.760
But humans can still tame elephants.

03:04.760 --> 03:09.260
You can catch an elephant and train it not to freak out around humans, then put it to

03:09.260 --> 03:10.260
work.

03:10.260 --> 03:14.020
But elephant domestication would require accurate records over several human lives.

03:14.020 --> 03:18.660
Never mind that keeping one or two tamed elephants around is incredibly costly, which

03:18.660 --> 03:23.700
is why war elephants only happened on occasion in already complex societies.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.260
Tame elephants are a luxury, hence this rule of thumb.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.380
If it's on a farm, it's domesticated.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.380
If it's in a circus, it's tame.

03:31.380 --> 03:32.380
Finally, families.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.900
Okay, zebra versus horses.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.980
Horses are civilization game changers.

03:36.980 --> 03:41.820
It's remarkable to think that from thousands BC until the telegraph, a dude on a horse

03:41.820 --> 03:44.160
was the best internet available.

03:44.160 --> 03:49.020
Horses were domesticated in Eurasia, but humans started in Africa, which has zebra.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.820
Why didn't the first humans ride out of Africa on the backs of zebra to conquer the world?

03:53.820 --> 03:55.220
Because zebra are bastards.

03:55.220 --> 03:59.020
They live to kick and bite, dangerous in a pre-penicillin world.

03:59.020 --> 04:03.420
And zebra also have a ducking reflex, making them very frustrating to lasso.

04:03.420 --> 04:08.260
In addition to being a real pain in the ass animal, zebra lack a family structure.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.020
Horse herds hierarchy.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.140
You can see it when they travel in a line.

04:12.140 --> 04:16.120
The male, top female, her foal, second female, her foals, and so on.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.980
Humans by capturing and taming the lead male become head horse.

04:19.980 --> 04:26.200
Lots of barnyard animals are barnyard animals because they have family values humans exploit.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.700
They just grow up with the idea that this human is a funny sort of take charge cow or

04:30.700 --> 04:31.700
whatever.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.700
No big deal.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.860
Chickens will peck peck peck until they've worked out who's top chicken.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.940
But you know who's really top chicken?

04:36.940 --> 04:38.220
We're top chicken.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.480
Dogs and cats, this is what makes them different.

04:40.480 --> 04:45.380
Dogs will love you and defend you and hunt with you because you're part of the pack.

04:45.380 --> 04:50.540
Dogs live to be useful to us, which in the modern world means falling over to play dead,

04:50.540 --> 04:51.540
but they love it.

04:51.540 --> 04:52.540
Bang.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.580
Good girl, good girl.

04:55.580 --> 04:58.260
Whereas a cat is a tiny tiger that lives in your house.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.580
Okay, back to these guys.

04:59.580 --> 05:02.780
For zebra, there's no such thing as society.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.540
They hang out in groups because it's a good survival strategy, but they don't really care.

05:06.540 --> 05:10.180
If you catch a zebra and his family won't follow, try to ride him and you'll be lucky

05:10.180 --> 05:11.900
to keep your fingers.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.580
Zebra look like horses on the outside, but not on the inside.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.580
So that's the checklist.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.100
Friendly, feedable, fecund, family friendly.

05:19.100 --> 05:24.860
It's not a long checklist, but for hunter-gatherers, any animal they wanted to domesticate needed

05:24.860 --> 05:25.900
everything.

05:25.900 --> 05:31.460
Which is why in early human history, only a baker's dozen of big animals were domesticated

05:31.460 --> 05:32.700
the world over.
