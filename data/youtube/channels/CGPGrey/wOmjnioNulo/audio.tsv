0	2320	Sheep weren't always this fluffy.
2320	5660	We fluffified them by breeding the fluffiest in each generation.
5660	9740	This is domestication, sculpting wild animals for better human use.
9740	13960	As we saw in part 1, for early man, animals were powerful tools.
13960	16580	Food, clothing, transportation, tractors.
16580	21760	Yet though there were animals everywhere, only a handful were domesticated in the pre-modern
21760	22760	world.
22760	24340	What made these different?
24340	26280	Let's make a domestication checklist, shall we?
26280	27280	First up, feedable.
27280	32040	A cow is a machine that turns grass into steaks, and a tiger a machine that turns steaks
32040	33200	into tiger.
33200	37660	Ten pounds of grass make a pound of steak, and ten pounds of steak make a pound of tiger.
37660	42020	But these have the same number of calories, so you might as well just eat the cow and
42020	43840	save yourself a lot of work.
43840	48420	So pure carnivores, you're not going to domesticate just because of thermodynamics.
48420	53280	You're looking for herbivores that aren't picky, they should eat something that's everywhere
53280	54800	that you can't eat.
54800	58440	Many omnivores better be happy eating whatever, and better be super worth it.
58440	62840	We are, however, putting the pig before the pen here, because first we need to catch something
62840	63840	that's friendly.
63840	68780	Okay, obviously catching a carnivore is a bad idea anyway because their day job is murder,
68780	72360	but plenty of omnivores like Grizzly's Moonlight in murder.
72360	74160	No safety in vegetarians either.
74160	78460	Buffalo are terrifying tanks for all the reasons mentioned before, hippos hold the murder high
78460	83900	score in Africa, giraffes look real dorky until you consider their striking range, lions
83900	85980	mostly leave them alone.
85980	91340	Animals it would be awesome to domesticate are, not coincidentally, super dangerous.
91340	95900	War bears would be a hell of an advantage for your tribe, but it's not going to happen.
95900	98960	And if it's big and not dangerous, it's a nervous wreck.
98960	100520	Try sneaking up on a gazelle?
100520	101520	Rhymes with LOL.
101520	105660	Sure, you and a team of buddies could spend the whole day marathon jogging it down to
105660	109140	exhaustion, but if it doesn't break its own neck as you try to drag it back home, then
109140	112820	it's going to casually leap out of whatever pen you built for it.
112820	113820	Okay, next up.
113820	119620	Some animals have reproductive, uh, preferences that make them incompatible with captivity.
119620	121280	Looking at you, pandas.
121280	126100	The time and energy humans have spent to get pandas to get on with it is comical.
126100	131380	Hunter-gatherers need an animal so eager to breed it gets it wrong sometimes, not an animal
131380	134380	whose mating seasons they have to keep careful track of.
134380	139980	So friendly, feedable, and fecund, it also needs to grow up fast.
139980	142780	This gets us to the heart of domestication versus taming.
142780	147060	Again, to domesticate a species is to change it to make it better for us.
147060	149820	And side note here, we domesticate plants as well.
149820	154120	We've bred them to be monstrous versions of their wild selves.
154120	158940	So when hippies talk about going back to nature, they forget that these plants are just as
158940	160420	man-made as this pop-tart.
160420	162000	Anyway, back to the animals.
162000	166620	The pig porkification project succeeded because pig generations are shorter than human generations.
166620	170620	A single clever human can make porky progress in their lifetime.
170620	172500	Compare and contrast elephants.
172500	178020	Two years to make a calf, five years in between calves, nine years until female maturity,
178020	180220	fifteen years for males.
180220	182620	You've got to be kidding elephants, there's no time for this.
182620	184760	But humans can still tame elephants.
184760	189260	You can catch an elephant and train it not to freak out around humans, then put it to
189260	190260	work.
190260	194020	But elephant domestication would require accurate records over several human lives.
194020	198660	Never mind that keeping one or two tamed elephants around is incredibly costly, which
198660	203700	is why war elephants only happened on occasion in already complex societies.
203700	207260	Tame elephants are a luxury, hence this rule of thumb.
207260	209380	If it's on a farm, it's domesticated.
209380	211380	If it's in a circus, it's tame.
211380	212380	Finally, families.
212380	214900	Okay, zebra versus horses.
214900	216980	Horses are civilization game changers.
216980	221820	It's remarkable to think that from thousands BC until the telegraph, a dude on a horse
221820	224160	was the best internet available.
224160	229020	Horses were domesticated in Eurasia, but humans started in Africa, which has zebra.
229020	233820	Why didn't the first humans ride out of Africa on the backs of zebra to conquer the world?
233820	235220	Because zebra are bastards.
235220	239020	They live to kick and bite, dangerous in a pre-penicillin world.
239020	243420	And zebra also have a ducking reflex, making them very frustrating to lasso.
243420	248260	In addition to being a real pain in the ass animal, zebra lack a family structure.
248260	250020	Horse herds hierarchy.
250020	252140	You can see it when they travel in a line.
252140	256120	The male, top female, her foal, second female, her foals, and so on.
256120	259980	Humans by capturing and taming the lead male become head horse.
259980	266200	Lots of barnyard animals are barnyard animals because they have family values humans exploit.
266200	270700	They just grow up with the idea that this human is a funny sort of take charge cow or
270700	271700	whatever.
271700	272700	No big deal.
272700	274860	Chickens will peck peck peck until they've worked out who's top chicken.
274860	276940	But you know who's really top chicken?
276940	278220	We're top chicken.
278220	280480	Dogs and cats, this is what makes them different.
280480	285380	Dogs will love you and defend you and hunt with you because you're part of the pack.
285380	290540	Dogs live to be useful to us, which in the modern world means falling over to play dead,
290540	291540	but they love it.
291540	292540	Bang.
292540	295580	Good girl, good girl.
295580	298260	Whereas a cat is a tiny tiger that lives in your house.
298260	299580	Okay, back to these guys.
299580	302780	For zebra, there's no such thing as society.
302780	306540	They hang out in groups because it's a good survival strategy, but they don't really care.
306540	310180	If you catch a zebra and his family won't follow, try to ride him and you'll be lucky
310180	311900	to keep your fingers.
311900	315580	Zebra look like horses on the outside, but not on the inside.
315580	316580	So that's the checklist.
316580	319100	Friendly, feedable, fecund, family friendly.
319100	324860	It's not a long checklist, but for hunter-gatherers, any animal they wanted to domesticate needed
324860	325900	everything.
325900	331460	Which is why in early human history, only a baker's dozen of big animals were domesticated
331460	332700	the world over.
