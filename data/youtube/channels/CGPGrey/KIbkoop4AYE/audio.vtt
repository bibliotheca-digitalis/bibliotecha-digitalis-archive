00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
The debt limit is a kind of financial weapon of mass destruction chained to the United

00:04.240 --> 00:06.680
States government by the United States government.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.680
Confused?

00:07.680 --> 00:10.640
Then it's time for The United States Debt Limit Explained.

00:10.640 --> 00:14.180
To understand the debt limit, you need to know the US splits financial responsibility

00:14.180 --> 00:16.340
between the President and Congress.

00:16.340 --> 00:18.800
The President has two jobs when it comes to money.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.960
One, collect taxes and two, spend those taxes to run the government.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.360
This might give you the impression that the President, with regards to money, is all powerful

00:26.360 --> 00:29.720
especially when you hear news reports on the President's new budget or his plan to

00:29.720 --> 00:33.420
raise taxes on haberdashers or lower taxes on apiarists.

00:33.420 --> 00:37.440
But reality is just the opposite and the President is the one who takes orders.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.440
From whom?

00:38.440 --> 00:39.440
Congress.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.640
Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level and determining how much the government will

00:42.640 --> 00:44.460
spend by writing a budget.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.920
So while the President does get to submit budgets to Congress and asks for changes in

00:47.920 --> 00:52.520
the tax level, these are just requests that Congress doesn't have to pay attention to.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.740
Congress can add or subtract anything they want from the President's budget or throw

00:55.740 --> 00:58.020
it out entirely and write a new one.

00:58.020 --> 01:00.340
The same goes for the level of taxes.

01:00.340 --> 01:04.460
So Congress decides what it wants, bridges, tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars,

01:04.460 --> 01:09.020
robots on Earth, national parks, whatever and approves a budget with that stuff in it.

01:09.020 --> 01:13.200
Once approved, the President is required by law to spend the money Congress listed in

01:13.200 --> 01:17.080
the budget and pay for it using the taxes that Congress set.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.220
As long as more taxes come in than spending goes out, everything is fine.

01:21.220 --> 01:25.700
But almost always, Congress puts more stuff in the budget than they cover with taxes which

01:25.700 --> 01:29.500
means that the President must borrow money to cover the difference.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.460
In most countries the story ends here because if their legislatures approve more spending

01:33.460 --> 01:38.140
than they have income, they've also implicitly approved the necessary borrowing.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.580
But not in America.

01:39.580 --> 01:44.060
Here Congress also limits the total amount of debt the United States can have.

01:44.060 --> 01:48.100
A debt limit sounds like a good idea until you see the real world consequences of these

01:48.100 --> 01:50.440
two branches of government interacting.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.980
As the total amount borrowed gets closer to the limit, Congress usually points to the

01:53.980 --> 01:58.100
President and acts shocked, shocked that his reckless spending has brought us so close

01:58.100 --> 02:01.860
to the debt limit that they, reasonable, prudent Congress, have set.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.120
And while it's technically correct that the President has borrowed this money, Congress

02:05.120 --> 02:09.580
has forced him to do it by approving a budget that the President is legally obligated to

02:09.580 --> 02:14.420
spend without also approving the necessary taxes to cover that spending.

02:14.420 --> 02:18.100
So the debt limit fight is essentially the government version of the playground favorite

02:18.100 --> 02:22.340
Stop Hitting Yourself, except with added terror for everyone watching.

02:22.340 --> 02:26.380
Therefore it's important to note the debt limit is not about future spending.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.940
It's not a credit card on which the limit will be raised so a crazy government party

02:29.940 --> 02:31.260
can be thrown.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.720
The debt limit is about paying bills already incurred.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.220
For example, the government hires a company to repave a federal highway.

02:38.220 --> 02:41.940
But if the US is at the debt limit when the company asks to be paid after the work has

02:41.940 --> 02:44.160
been done, the government can't.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.940
This shakes trust in the US and since large parts of the global economy depend on the

02:48.940 --> 02:53.460
dollar being trustworthy, messing with that trust is a big deal.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.460
But there is a way out.

02:54.460 --> 02:58.740
Congress can raise the debt limit and, because of the aforementioned terror, they always

02:58.740 --> 02:59.740
have.

02:59.740 --> 03:03.280
So if not raising the debt ceiling is potentially disastrous and the solution is simple and

03:03.280 --> 03:08.100
always taken in the end, why does this debate last months?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.700
Because politics.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.720
The debt limit isn't in the Constitution, Congress created it themselves and from their

03:13.720 --> 03:17.180
point of view the debt limit is awesome because 1.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.880
It creates a problem that 2.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.360
Congress can technically blame on the president who 3.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.200
Needs the solution that only they can provide.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.760
Congress gets to use the threat of mutual financial self-destruction as leverage in

03:27.760 --> 03:32.940
negotiations that they benefit from extending until the last possible second.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.260
