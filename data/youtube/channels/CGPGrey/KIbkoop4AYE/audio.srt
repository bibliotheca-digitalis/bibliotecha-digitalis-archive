1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
The debt limit is a kind of financial weapon of mass destruction chained to the United

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,680
States government by the United States government.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Confused?

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,640
Then it's time for The United States Debt Limit Explained.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,180
To understand the debt limit, you need to know the US splits financial responsibility

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,340
between the President and Congress.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,800
The President has two jobs when it comes to money.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
One, collect taxes and two, spend those taxes to run the government.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,360
This might give you the impression that the President, with regards to money, is all powerful

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,720
especially when you hear news reports on the President's new budget or his plan to

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,420
raise taxes on haberdashers or lower taxes on apiarists.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,440
But reality is just the opposite and the President is the one who takes orders.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
From whom?

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Congress.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level and determining how much the government will

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,460
spend by writing a budget.

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,920
So while the President does get to submit budgets to Congress and asks for changes in

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,520
the tax level, these are just requests that Congress doesn't have to pay attention to.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,740
Congress can add or subtract anything they want from the President's budget or throw

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,020
it out entirely and write a new one.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,340
The same goes for the level of taxes.

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,460
So Congress decides what it wants, bridges, tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars,

23
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,020
robots on Earth, national parks, whatever and approves a budget with that stuff in it.

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,200
Once approved, the President is required by law to spend the money Congress listed in

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,080
the budget and pay for it using the taxes that Congress set.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,220
As long as more taxes come in than spending goes out, everything is fine.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,700
But almost always, Congress puts more stuff in the budget than they cover with taxes which

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,500
means that the President must borrow money to cover the difference.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,460
In most countries the story ends here because if their legislatures approve more spending

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,140
than they have income, they've also implicitly approved the necessary borrowing.

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,580
But not in America.

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,060
Here Congress also limits the total amount of debt the United States can have.

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,100
A debt limit sounds like a good idea until you see the real world consequences of these

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,440
two branches of government interacting.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,980
As the total amount borrowed gets closer to the limit, Congress usually points to the

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,100
President and acts shocked, shocked that his reckless spending has brought us so close

37
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,860
to the debt limit that they, reasonable, prudent Congress, have set.

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,120
And while it's technically correct that the President has borrowed this money, Congress

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,580
has forced him to do it by approving a budget that the President is legally obligated to

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,420
spend without also approving the necessary taxes to cover that spending.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,100
So the debt limit fight is essentially the government version of the playground favorite

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,340
Stop Hitting Yourself, except with added terror for everyone watching.

43
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,380
Therefore it's important to note the debt limit is not about future spending.

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,940
It's not a credit card on which the limit will be raised so a crazy government party

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,260
can be thrown.

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,720
The debt limit is about paying bills already incurred.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,220
For example, the government hires a company to repave a federal highway.

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,940
But if the US is at the debt limit when the company asks to be paid after the work has

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,160
been done, the government can't.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,940
This shakes trust in the US and since large parts of the global economy depend on the

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,460
dollar being trustworthy, messing with that trust is a big deal.

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
But there is a way out.

53
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,740
Congress can raise the debt limit and, because of the aforementioned terror, they always

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
have.

55
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,280
So if not raising the debt ceiling is potentially disastrous and the solution is simple and

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,100
always taken in the end, why does this debate last months?

57
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,700
Because politics.

58
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,720
The debt limit isn't in the Constitution, Congress created it themselves and from their

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,180
point of view the debt limit is awesome because 1.

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,880
It creates a problem that 2.

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,360
Congress can technically blame on the president who 3.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,200
Needs the solution that only they can provide.

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,760
Congress gets to use the threat of mutual financial self-destruction as leverage in

64
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,940
negotiations that they benefit from extending until the last possible second.

65
