0	4240	The debt limit is a kind of financial weapon of mass destruction chained to the United
4240	6680	States government by the United States government.
6680	7680	Confused?
7680	10640	Then it's time for The United States Debt Limit Explained.
10640	14180	To understand the debt limit, you need to know the US splits financial responsibility
14180	16340	between the President and Congress.
16340	18800	The President has two jobs when it comes to money.
18800	22960	One, collect taxes and two, spend those taxes to run the government.
22960	26360	This might give you the impression that the President, with regards to money, is all powerful
26360	29720	especially when you hear news reports on the President's new budget or his plan to
29720	33420	raise taxes on haberdashers or lower taxes on apiarists.
33420	37440	But reality is just the opposite and the President is the one who takes orders.
37440	38440	From whom?
38440	39440	Congress.
39440	42640	Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level and determining how much the government will
42640	44460	spend by writing a budget.
44460	47920	So while the President does get to submit budgets to Congress and asks for changes in
47920	52520	the tax level, these are just requests that Congress doesn't have to pay attention to.
52520	55740	Congress can add or subtract anything they want from the President's budget or throw
55740	58020	it out entirely and write a new one.
58020	60340	The same goes for the level of taxes.
60340	64460	So Congress decides what it wants, bridges, tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars,
64460	69020	robots on Earth, national parks, whatever and approves a budget with that stuff in it.
69020	73200	Once approved, the President is required by law to spend the money Congress listed in
73200	77080	the budget and pay for it using the taxes that Congress set.
77080	81220	As long as more taxes come in than spending goes out, everything is fine.
81220	85700	But almost always, Congress puts more stuff in the budget than they cover with taxes which
85700	89500	means that the President must borrow money to cover the difference.
89500	93460	In most countries the story ends here because if their legislatures approve more spending
93460	98140	than they have income, they've also implicitly approved the necessary borrowing.
98140	99580	But not in America.
99580	104060	Here Congress also limits the total amount of debt the United States can have.
104060	108100	A debt limit sounds like a good idea until you see the real world consequences of these
108100	110440	two branches of government interacting.
110440	113980	As the total amount borrowed gets closer to the limit, Congress usually points to the
113980	118100	President and acts shocked, shocked that his reckless spending has brought us so close
118100	121860	to the debt limit that they, reasonable, prudent Congress, have set.
121860	125120	And while it's technically correct that the President has borrowed this money, Congress
125120	129580	has forced him to do it by approving a budget that the President is legally obligated to
129580	134420	spend without also approving the necessary taxes to cover that spending.
134420	138100	So the debt limit fight is essentially the government version of the playground favorite
138100	142340	Stop Hitting Yourself, except with added terror for everyone watching.
142340	146380	Therefore it's important to note the debt limit is not about future spending.
146380	149940	It's not a credit card on which the limit will be raised so a crazy government party
149940	151260	can be thrown.
151260	154720	The debt limit is about paying bills already incurred.
154720	158220	For example, the government hires a company to repave a federal highway.
158220	161940	But if the US is at the debt limit when the company asks to be paid after the work has
161940	164160	been done, the government can't.
164160	168940	This shakes trust in the US and since large parts of the global economy depend on the
168940	173460	dollar being trustworthy, messing with that trust is a big deal.
173460	174460	But there is a way out.
174460	178740	Congress can raise the debt limit and, because of the aforementioned terror, they always
178740	179740	have.
179740	183280	So if not raising the debt ceiling is potentially disastrous and the solution is simple and
183280	188100	always taken in the end, why does this debate last months?
188100	189700	Because politics.
189700	193720	The debt limit isn't in the Constitution, Congress created it themselves and from their
193720	197180	point of view the debt limit is awesome because 1.
197180	198880	It creates a problem that 2.
198880	201360	Congress can technically blame on the president who 3.
201360	204200	Needs the solution that only they can provide.
204200	207760	Congress gets to use the threat of mutual financial self-destruction as leverage in
207760	212940	negotiations that they benefit from extending until the last possible second.
