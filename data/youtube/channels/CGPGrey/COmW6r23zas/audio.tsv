0	4720	Hello, Internet. Time for a quick update regarding everyone's favorite voting system,
4720	11120	the Electoral College, America's idiosyncratic method of picking her president.
11120	16960	It's been unchanged mostly for centuries, but this video exists because in July 2020,
16960	20800	there was some Supreme Court popcorn about faithless electors,
20800	23920	one of the most controversial mechanisms of the system.
23920	28720	Lightning-quick Electoral College recap. The states get votes for president proportional-ish
28720	33600	to their populations. For most citizens, how many votes their state gets is all they need to know.
33600	38720	But for you watching this video, you want to go down a level below to know what the deal is
38720	43280	with faithless electors and the Napa vote interco plan and this new ruling.
43280	48640	So the level below is that the state votes aren't really votes, they're people.
48640	52240	After the national election, the state doesn't cast their number of votes,
52240	57120	but rather appoints that number of people to vote for president in their capital.
57120	62720	And it's all of these people in their respective state capitals who are the electors,
62720	66080	and it's their votes that truly decide the president.
66080	69200	Side note, at this point, everyone always asks, who are these people?
69200	74240	And the answer is they're chosen in advance by the parties and are usually local party officials.
74240	80320	Each party picks their own group of electors, and so the national election is really a way
80320	86480	each state decides which of the pre-approved groups will do the real voting for president.
86480	88640	Anyway, here's where faithless electors come in.
88640	93520	These electors are supposed to vote for the official candidate of the party that picked them,
93520	95200	but they don't have to.
95200	99440	Back in the 1700s, the idea was that by the time all the electors got together,
99440	103520	there was going to be a lot more they could know about the candidates and the
103520	107360	current political situation than voters back home could ever have known.
107360	111760	Remember, communication at the time wasn't with smartphones or with telegraphs,
111760	115040	but with letters carried by a dude on a horse.
115040	117760	So if you wanted to be up to date on politics,
117760	120160	you had to be in the capital where it was happening,
120160	122560	which is why the electors had to meet in person,
122560	125280	and also why it took place weeks later.
125280	127040	Because there were no trains either.
127040	130400	All this is to say that if you were an elector in 1796,
130400	133120	by the time you got to the capital and caught up on the news,
133120	137760	there might be good reasons you'd want to switch your vote and become a faithless elector.
137760	140640	Though it turned out over the centuries this rarely happened,
140640	143440	and never in enough numbers to change the president.
143440	146720	But the possibility of a post-national election,
146720	150320	pre-inauguration presidential switch, has always been present.
150320	153120	Either as a final gambit from the losing side,
153120	157600	or because a disagreeing faction on the winning side was glad to have won,
157600	162320	but not glad about the candidate they won with and so would like to swap.
162320	167200	Either of these faithless coups would in modern times doubtless cause citizen outrage,
167200	171600	but would nonetheless be a-okay with the electoral college rules.
171600	172960	That's faithless electors.
172960	177200	Which, if you believe most news headlines, the Supreme Court has just banned.
177200	179440	But of course, not exactly.
179440	185840	In their 2020 decision, the court-ruled states may pass laws preventing faithless electors.
186640	187600	And that's it.
187600	190400	The Supreme Court herself hasn't prevented anything.
190400	192560	In fact, this case is a bit of a nothing-burger.
192560	196400	A unanimous decision that the states can tell their electors what to do.
196400	199760	Based on this line in the constitution, the court interpreted as
200240	204880	conveying the broadest power of determination over electors and their actions.
204880	210480	That interpretation is not from the 2020 case, by the way, but from an 1892 case.
210480	212080	The court just reaffirmed it.
212080	215520	So the states telling their electors what to do is nothing new.
215520	218000	Which is why at the time of the 2020 court decision,
218000	221840	32 states already had laws preventing faithless electors.
221840	226160	This modern decision is just the Supreme Court giving a casual thumbs up.
226160	229440	As for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Plan, explained here,
230240	236480	It's entirely about binding electors to their party,
236480	240480	and not at all about how a state picks which group of electors to send,
240480	243600	which is the whole basis of the Napavo Interco plan,
243600	248160	and will yield plenty more Supreme Court popcorn if it ever gets enacted.
248160	250880	But for now, absolutely nothing has changed.
259440	269680	Thank you.
