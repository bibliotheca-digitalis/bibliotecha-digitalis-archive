00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello, Internet. Time for a quick update regarding everyone's favorite voting system,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,120
the Electoral College, America's idiosyncratic method of picking her president.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,960
It's been unchanged mostly for centuries, but this video exists because in July 2020,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
there was some Supreme Court popcorn about faithless electors,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920
one of the most controversial mechanisms of the system.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
Lightning-quick Electoral College recap. The states get votes for president proportional-ish

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,600
to their populations. For most citizens, how many votes their state gets is all they need to know.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,720
But for you watching this video, you want to go down a level below to know what the deal is

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,280
with faithless electors and the Napa vote interco plan and this new ruling.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,640
So the level below is that the state votes aren't really votes, they're people.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,240
After the national election, the state doesn't cast their number of votes,

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,120
but rather appoints that number of people to vote for president in their capital.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,720
And it's all of these people in their respective state capitals who are the electors,

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,080
and it's their votes that truly decide the president.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,200
Side note, at this point, everyone always asks, who are these people?

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
And the answer is they're chosen in advance by the parties and are usually local party officials.

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,320
Each party picks their own group of electors, and so the national election is really a way

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,480
each state decides which of the pre-approved groups will do the real voting for president.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,640
Anyway, here's where faithless electors come in.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,520
These electors are supposed to vote for the official candidate of the party that picked them,

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
but they don't have to.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,440
Back in the 1700s, the idea was that by the time all the electors got together,

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,520
there was going to be a lot more they could know about the candidates and the

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,360
current political situation than voters back home could ever have known.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,760
Remember, communication at the time wasn't with smartphones or with telegraphs,

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,040
but with letters carried by a dude on a horse.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,760
So if you wanted to be up to date on politics,

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,160
you had to be in the capital where it was happening,

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,560
which is why the electors had to meet in person,

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,280
and also why it took place weeks later.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
Because there were no trains either.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,400
All this is to say that if you were an elector in 1796,

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,120
by the time you got to the capital and caught up on the news,

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,760
there might be good reasons you'd want to switch your vote and become a faithless elector.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
Though it turned out over the centuries this rarely happened,

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,440
and never in enough numbers to change the president.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
But the possibility of a post-national election,

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,320
pre-inauguration presidential switch, has always been present.

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,120
Either as a final gambit from the losing side,

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,600
or because a disagreeing faction on the winning side was glad to have won,

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,320
but not glad about the candidate they won with and so would like to swap.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,200
Either of these faithless coups would in modern times doubtless cause citizen outrage,

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,600
but would nonetheless be a-okay with the electoral college rules.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,960
That's faithless electors.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,200
Which, if you believe most news headlines, the Supreme Court has just banned.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
But of course, not exactly.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
In their 2020 decision, the court-ruled states may pass laws preventing faithless electors.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
And that's it.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,400
The Supreme Court herself hasn't prevented anything.

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
In fact, this case is a bit of a nothing-burger.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,400
A unanimous decision that the states can tell their electors what to do.

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
Based on this line in the constitution, the court interpreted as

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,880
conveying the broadest power of determination over electors and their actions.

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,480
That interpretation is not from the 2020 case, by the way, but from an 1892 case.

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,080
The court just reaffirmed it.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,520
So the states telling their electors what to do is nothing new.

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Which is why at the time of the 2020 court decision,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,840
32 states already had laws preventing faithless electors.

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,160
This modern decision is just the Supreme Court giving a casual thumbs up.

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,440
As for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Plan, explained here,

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,480
It's entirely about binding electors to their party,

62
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
and not at all about how a state picks which group of electors to send,

63
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,600
which is the whole basis of the Napavo Interco plan,

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,160
and will yield plenty more Supreme Court popcorn if it ever gets enacted.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,880
But for now, absolutely nothing has changed.

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Thank you.
