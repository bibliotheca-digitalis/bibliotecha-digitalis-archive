Hello, Internet. Time for a quick update regarding everyone's favorite voting system,

00:04.720 --> 00:11.120
the Electoral College, America's idiosyncratic method of picking her president.

00:11.120 --> 00:16.960
It's been unchanged mostly for centuries, but this video exists because in July 2020,

00:16.960 --> 00:20.800
there was some Supreme Court popcorn about faithless electors,

00:20.800 --> 00:23.920
one of the most controversial mechanisms of the system.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.720
Lightning-quick Electoral College recap. The states get votes for president proportional-ish

00:28.720 --> 00:33.600
to their populations. For most citizens, how many votes their state gets is all they need to know.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.720
But for you watching this video, you want to go down a level below to know what the deal is

00:38.720 --> 00:43.280
with faithless electors and the Napa vote interco plan and this new ruling.

00:43.280 --> 00:48.640
So the level below is that the state votes aren't really votes, they're people.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.240
After the national election, the state doesn't cast their number of votes,

00:52.240 --> 00:57.120
but rather appoints that number of people to vote for president in their capital.

00:57.120 --> 01:02.720
And it's all of these people in their respective state capitals who are the electors,

01:02.720 --> 01:06.080
and it's their votes that truly decide the president.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.200
Side note, at this point, everyone always asks, who are these people?

01:09.200 --> 01:14.240
And the answer is they're chosen in advance by the parties and are usually local party officials.

01:14.240 --> 01:20.320
Each party picks their own group of electors, and so the national election is really a way

01:20.320 --> 01:26.480
each state decides which of the pre-approved groups will do the real voting for president.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.640
Anyway, here's where faithless electors come in.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.520
These electors are supposed to vote for the official candidate of the party that picked them,

01:33.520 --> 01:35.200
but they don't have to.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.440
Back in the 1700s, the idea was that by the time all the electors got together,

01:39.440 --> 01:43.520
there was going to be a lot more they could know about the candidates and the

01:43.520 --> 01:47.360
current political situation than voters back home could ever have known.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.760
Remember, communication at the time wasn't with smartphones or with telegraphs,

01:51.760 --> 01:55.040
but with letters carried by a dude on a horse.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.760
So if you wanted to be up to date on politics,

01:57.760 --> 02:00.160
you had to be in the capital where it was happening,

02:00.160 --> 02:02.560
which is why the electors had to meet in person,

02:02.560 --> 02:05.280
and also why it took place weeks later.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.040
Because there were no trains either.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.400
All this is to say that if you were an elector in 1796,

02:10.400 --> 02:13.120
by the time you got to the capital and caught up on the news,

02:13.120 --> 02:17.760
there might be good reasons you'd want to switch your vote and become a faithless elector.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.640
Though it turned out over the centuries this rarely happened,

02:20.640 --> 02:23.440
and never in enough numbers to change the president.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.720
But the possibility of a post-national election,

02:26.720 --> 02:30.320
pre-inauguration presidential switch, has always been present.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.120
Either as a final gambit from the losing side,

02:33.120 --> 02:37.600
or because a disagreeing faction on the winning side was glad to have won,

02:37.600 --> 02:42.320
but not glad about the candidate they won with and so would like to swap.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.200
Either of these faithless coups would in modern times doubtless cause citizen outrage,

02:47.200 --> 02:51.600
but would nonetheless be a-okay with the electoral college rules.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.960
That's faithless electors.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.200
Which, if you believe most news headlines, the Supreme Court has just banned.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.440
But of course, not exactly.

02:59.440 --> 03:05.840
In their 2020 decision, the court-ruled states may pass laws preventing faithless electors.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.600
And that's it.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.400
The Supreme Court herself hasn't prevented anything.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.560
In fact, this case is a bit of a nothing-burger.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.400
A unanimous decision that the states can tell their electors what to do.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.760
Based on this line in the constitution, the court interpreted as

03:20.240 --> 03:24.880
conveying the broadest power of determination over electors and their actions.

03:24.880 --> 03:30.480
That interpretation is not from the 2020 case, by the way, but from an 1892 case.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.080
The court just reaffirmed it.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.520
So the states telling their electors what to do is nothing new.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.000
Which is why at the time of the 2020 court decision,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.840
32 states already had laws preventing faithless electors.

03:41.840 --> 03:46.160
This modern decision is just the Supreme Court giving a casual thumbs up.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.440
As for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Plan, explained here,

03:50.240 --> 03:56.480
It's entirely about binding electors to their party,

03:56.480 --> 04:00.480
and not at all about how a state picks which group of electors to send,

04:00.480 --> 04:03.600
which is the whole basis of the Napavo Interco plan,

04:03.600 --> 04:08.160
and will yield plenty more Supreme Court popcorn if it ever gets enacted.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.880
But for now, absolutely nothing has changed.

04:19.440 --> 04:29.680
Thank you.
