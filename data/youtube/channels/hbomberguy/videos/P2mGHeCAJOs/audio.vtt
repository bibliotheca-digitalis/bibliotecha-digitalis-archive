00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Banjo-Kazooie was one of my favorite games as a kid.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.600
Okay, that's not quite true.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.500
Growing up, it was terrifying.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.900
The way the level transitioned into that fucking painting,

00:09.900 --> 00:11.200
it scared the shit out of me.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.800
This giant head just looking at you.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.000
And that happens again!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.800
Oh, the music that plays when you're in the water

00:16.800 --> 00:19.500
and the fucking shark starts chasing you.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.000
It still makes me tense up thinking about it.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.500
The sea mine with eyes that hated you so much

00:25.500 --> 00:28.600
he would go for you and explode and die

00:28.600 --> 00:31.300
just to take a single honeycomb off your life bar

00:31.300 --> 00:33.900
gave me actual nightmares as a kid.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.200
I'm not even joking.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.000
Banjo-Kazooie ruined my life.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.100
Tons of people remember the quiz section

00:41.100 --> 00:44.700
at the end of Banjo-Kazooie as being kind of unfair,

00:44.700 --> 00:48.100
but really importantly, tons of people remember the quiz,

00:48.100 --> 00:50.700
which is more than can be said for any section

00:50.700 --> 00:54.200
of any of the old platforming collect-a-thons of the time.

00:54.200 --> 00:58.200
Do you even remember Tonic Trouble or Bomberman Hero

00:58.300 --> 01:01.400
or that shite-ass Earthworm Jim game

01:01.400 --> 01:03.300
that came out that was 3D?

01:03.300 --> 01:07.100
Does anyone remember Gex, Enter the Gecko?

01:07.100 --> 01:08.700
Let's get it on!

01:08.700 --> 01:11.800
It's tail time! It's tail time!

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900
It's tail time! It's tail time!

01:13.900 --> 01:15.100
What?

01:15.100 --> 01:17.100
It's tail time!

01:17.100 --> 01:19.600
I know what you're thinking. It's tail time.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.800
I'm gonna need an explanation for this.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.100
We can't go on like this.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.100
This is madness.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.000
Flash forward to 2017.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.800
It's been a really long time since these games came out

01:30.800 --> 01:34.100
and almost as long as the 3D platformer was really in fashion,

01:34.100 --> 01:36.700
with basically only Mario as the last man standing

01:36.700 --> 01:38.100
with this kind of gameplay,

01:38.100 --> 01:41.000
outside, of course, of indie stuff.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.200
One such piece of indie stuff is Yooka-Laylee,

01:43.200 --> 01:44.800
created by Playtonic Games,

01:44.800 --> 01:46.400
composed of folks who left Rareware

01:46.400 --> 01:49.000
after seemingly getting sick of working under Microsoft,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.500
making Kinect sports games

01:50.500 --> 01:52.600
and putting out ports of their good stuff.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.600
Yooka-Laylee is in a really difficult and weird place.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.300
In going after a genre of game that was seemingly outgrown

01:58.300 --> 01:59.700
well over a decade ago,

01:59.700 --> 02:02.500
is bringing back these mechanics and systems really enough?

02:02.500 --> 02:05.200
Or are there ways to adapt the formula to a modern setting

02:05.200 --> 02:07.700
and make it better than it was even back in the day,

02:07.700 --> 02:10.100
like Doom recently did for its originals?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.200
The controls are incredible.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.800
The basic walk feels fast enough to get you where you want to go,

03:18.800 --> 03:20.000
as opposed to the originals,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.300
where you would end up always using the talent trot.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.900
The game's version of the trot uses energy now,

03:24.900 --> 03:27.400
but it does this because it's now even faster,

03:27.400 --> 03:29.900
and controls very differently from just a standard run.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.700
You have something of a turning radius.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.200
Getting good at using it just feels good.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.800
The game makes mobility itself create a good feeling

03:36.800 --> 03:39.100
in a way I haven't seen in quite a long time.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.700
There's so much charm to almost every little thing.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.800
There's so much variety to the character designs and their personalities

03:44.800 --> 03:46.800
in a way that completely fits the original.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.500
There's a bunch of snowmen in the snow level,

03:48.500 --> 03:51.700
and one of them dresses like Gruntilda used to and talks in rhymes.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.000
There are cute puns in all the names all over the place.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.100
I especially like the sign who confuses you for a gardener or redecorator every level,

03:58.100 --> 03:59.800
and he's called, like, Planker.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.900
And then there's little things, too,

04:00.900 --> 04:03.300
like the noises Laylee makes when you're doing the roll move.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

04:06.600 --> 04:07.600
It's beautiful.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
It's—it's just cute.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.900
The story's kind of cool.

04:10.900 --> 04:15.700
You can really feel the seething hatred for the time the creators spent working under Microsoft.

04:15.700 --> 04:19.400
The villain is a giant corporation run by Capital B.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.800
Do you—do—

04:20.800 --> 04:22.100
Do you get it?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.300
Do—do you—do you underst—the ca—

04:25.200 --> 04:30.100
Capital B's company, Hivery Towers, has built a giant sucking machine.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.700
MUCH LIKE MICROSOFT

04:31.700 --> 04:33.400
And it stole Yuko and Laylee's book.

04:33.400 --> 04:38.000
To get it back, they have to infiltrate Hivery Towers to find and collect all the pages that fell out of it.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.900
It's a pretty classic and simple setup,

04:39.900 --> 04:45.100
but it works, and I enjoy the massive jabs at corporate structure that it takes.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.200
I—I didn't expect that.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.200
When I see Trowser, the snake,

04:49.300 --> 04:52.200
I wonder how many years they waited to make that joke.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.200
Like, I imagine him being on the cutting room floor of Conker or something, and they were like,

04:56.200 --> 05:01.900
One day, we'll make the greatest anthropomorphic dick joke ever in the sequel if we ever get one.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.500
And now, 32 years later, here he is!

05:05.500 --> 05:11.900
Kirkhope, Wise, and Burke have done a fantastic job of blending the modern capabilities of game soundtracks

05:11.900 --> 05:16.900
with the sensibilities that made their work on the older games consoles so special in the first place.

05:16.900 --> 05:21.000
While it never feels like it does something truly beyond what the originals could do,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.200
it feels like it's doing the sort of thing the originals would have done if they'd had the chance.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.900
The creators patched out audiobook salesman and white nationalist JonTron's dialogue from the game,

05:30.900 --> 05:33.900
which is a shame, because if there's one thing JonTron is good at,

05:33.900 --> 05:37.400
it's making meaningless, incoherent noise into a microphone.

05:37.400 --> 05:41.900
It must suck to discover that your favorite guys have been infected by communism.

05:41.900 --> 05:46.000
The game is ultra-faithful to the design spec of the works it's throwing back to.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.500
But the thing about this faithfulness is that it means all the problems I have with the previous games,

05:50.500 --> 05:55.500
all the glaring issues that are even more clear in retrospect, are still present all this time later.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.500
People who don't like the original games going back to them without nostalgia,

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
or who never really got them at the time, will not get Yooka-Laylee either.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.700
It's another one of those games, good and bad.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.900
However, there are some things about Yooka-Laylee that are really interesting.

06:08.900 --> 06:14.500
In faithfully recreating a dead genre, it resurrects gameplay elements that were fun, or good, or useful,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
but got lost in the mists of time.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.000
So I thought I'd explore some of the elements that might be worth keeping around,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.500
and reincorporating back into modern design.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.000
Take, for example, the level transitions.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
The originals needed a transition because you literally couldn't fit that much of a level in data.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.500
A standard trick in game development at the time was to have the inside and outside be two separate areas entirely,

06:35.500 --> 06:41.000
with a loading zone between them, or put a zone between two sections of the same area when it can be justified.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
In Banjo-Tooie, the sequel, this makes the ascent up the Isle of Hags even more impressive

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
because the developers are successfully simulating climbing a giant mountain

06:50.000 --> 06:56.500
with numerous quite small areas where modern games could just put the whole mountain there and have you climb it.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.000
Yooka-Laylee is made in an era where you don't really need loading screens.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.500
Modern consoles and PCs have much more memory and processing power,

07:03.500 --> 07:07.500
and using strategic loading and unloading, you can have an entire seamless world

07:07.500 --> 07:12.000
with careful loading between maps without ever, ever having to actually stop.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.500
But Yooka-Laylee still has these transitions.

07:14.500 --> 07:19.500
This shortcut to the top of a mountain is a transition when both pieces of the game world are physically there,

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
and nothing really needs to be loaded in and out.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.500
This passage leads inside the mountain into a relatively small area

07:26.500 --> 07:30.000
you could have just modeled inside the mountain and had you walk inside.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.500
This design sensibility is throughout the game,

07:32.500 --> 07:37.500
but the thing is, this isn't just reusing antiquated solutions to problems that don't exist anymore.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.500
This kind of level design still has a kind of value of its own.

07:41.500 --> 07:46.500
You could have a passage inside the mouth of this cave leading all the way up to the top,

07:46.500 --> 07:50.500
but then this shortcut would be significantly longer, wouldn't it?

07:50.500 --> 07:54.000
You would have to physically climb or walk or wait in an elevator.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.500
The teleportation of sorts you get from having it just be a dark cave you walk into and come out at the top

07:59.500 --> 08:04.500
is a really convenient time saver, something you want from a shortcut.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
Keep notes, FromSoftware!

08:06.500 --> 08:11.500
Something this era of games always did very well was lie to you.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
You went into a building, and it was bigger on the inside.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.500
Was this a mistake? An accident? Did someone fuck up on the blueprints?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.500
No. They did it because they thought it was better that way.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
They didn't have to be constrained by what the outside of the building looked like

08:25.500 --> 08:29.000
because you were in a different map, ruled by different constraints.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
The world of Banjo-Kazooie was almost a literal cartoon

08:32.000 --> 08:35.500
whose shape changed as it was needed to suit the gameplay.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
The inside of Duke's Temple is a different shape and size from the outside,

08:39.500 --> 08:44.000
something only manageable when both areas are bespoke and separated by a transition.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
So even though these design elements were used to avoid limitations of the original hardware,

08:48.000 --> 08:53.500
there is a genuine, noticeable advantage in these elements, even when those limitations are removed.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.000
The other thing these games have is purposefulness in their controls.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
You are fully responsible for everything the character does.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Modern game design seeks to simplify a lot of the experience of controlling a character.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
This looks really cool, doesn't it?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm holding forwards.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I can't wait to fight you again.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Game design.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.500
You run Ezio or Altair or any of the shitty, unmemorable characters that came afterwards

09:58.500 --> 10:01.000
towards a ledge holding the do cool shit button,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
and he runs and jumps and climbs all over the shop.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.000
This isn't gameplay.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Assassin's Creed is almost the closest thing the collect-a-thon has to a successor,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
what with all the collecting you're doing,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
but it's really unengaging because most of the work is done by Altezzio for you.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.500
You just point him at the thing.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.500
The same is true of games like Uncharted or Tomb Raider and so on.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.000
These games aren't necessarily bad,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
but they've moved the simple fun of controlling the character

10:27.000 --> 10:29.500
to navigate challenges into the background,

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
and that's not always a good thing.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.500
In old platformers, every move was deliberate.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
You have to keep yourself on a ledge here.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
It's easy to fall off or miss a jump,

10:38.500 --> 10:41.500
and this makes landing the jump correctly satisfying.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.000
The supposed simplification of the mechanics of a game

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
has removed some of the more crunchy and interesting and satisfying elements of the actual games.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
I honestly spent the first couple of hours of Yooka-Laylee feeling flabbergasted

10:53.000 --> 10:56.500
that, for the first time in ages, I was pressing a button to jump

10:56.500 --> 10:58.500
and then moving to where I wanted to move,

10:58.500 --> 11:01.000
using my own abilities to control the character

11:01.000 --> 11:03.500
instead of pointing them at the thing and letting them do whatever.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.000
And also, like when I first replayed Banjo-Kazooie a little while ago,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.500
I kept staring at the corner of the screen.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.000
I wondered why, but then when I was playing Shady Morty to get this footage,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.500
I realized why.

11:14.500 --> 11:19.000
I was looking for the mini-map to tell me where to go to do the stuff I was supposed to do.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I think one reason the levels in these games are more memorable,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
literally stick out in your mind so well you could take a quiz about them,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
is because they're built around leading you around with their design

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
and encouraging a real sense of curiosity about them.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
It's very rare for any aspect of the landscapes of modern games to really pop out at you,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.500
existing as mostly giant empty spaces you navigate with a GPS

11:40.500 --> 11:43.000
telling you where all the interesting stuff is already.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Making your world interesting to simply explore and look and see and find things for yourself

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
instead of the thing you pass through on the way to the interesting stuff marked on the map

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
is a really good idea, which, outside of Yooka-Laylee and Breath of the Wild,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
is a practice going unfortunately forgotten in many modern game genres.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.000
The game itself isn't perfect, even though I really enjoyed it

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
and was capable of looking past the flaws the way I looked past them back in the day.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
It deliberately embraces many of the trappings and conventions of a genre

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
that probably went away for a reason,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.500
but it contains elements of design and execution that can still be learned from.

12:16.500 --> 12:21.000
The wealth of design possibilities opened up by placing level design and convenience for the player

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
over physical coherence,

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
the joyful freedom of a simple but nice-feeling control scheme that takes skill to master properly,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.500
the memorable adventure of exploring a space and scouring it for stuff by yourself

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
without anyone telling you where anything is,

12:34.500 --> 12:37.500
having to actually look using ingenuity to find,

12:37.500 --> 12:40.500
consequently forcing you, without even noticing,

12:40.500 --> 12:45.500
to memorize the landscape of a location until you can see it in your head when you shut your eyes.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.500
No!

12:48.000 --> 12:48.500
No!

12:48.500 --> 12:52.500
And, most importantly, putting eyes on everything.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Everything.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
EVERYTHING!

12:55.500 --> 12:57.000
Those are just eyes.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.500
They walk around, and they find stuff to possess, and then it becomes their body.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.000
Jesus Christ, even the fucking logo has eyes now.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Is everyone alright down there at Playtonic?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
Do you need help?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.000
Can I help you?

13:11.000 --> 13:15.500
Perhaps the collect-a-thons of old can't really exist in the modern day without being altered so much

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
they don't really resemble themselves anymore.

13:17.500 --> 13:22.000
But, within that old style, there lies all kinds of useful little...

13:22.000 --> 13:27.500
pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of gaming that are worth keeping around.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.500
Yooka-Laylee's Choices are just another...

13:30.500 --> 13:32.000
page...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
in the book...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.500
of game design.
