0	3300	Banjo-Kazooie was one of my favorite games as a kid.
3300	5600	Okay, that's not quite true.
5600	7500	Growing up, it was terrifying.
7500	9900	The way the level transitioned into that fucking painting,
9900	11200	it scared the shit out of me.
11200	13800	This giant head just looking at you.
13800	15000	And that happens again!
15000	16800	Oh, the music that plays when you're in the water
16800	19500	and the fucking shark starts chasing you.
19500	22000	It still makes me tense up thinking about it.
22000	25500	The sea mine with eyes that hated you so much
25500	28600	he would go for you and explode and die
28600	31300	just to take a single honeycomb off your life bar
31300	33900	gave me actual nightmares as a kid.
33900	35200	I'm not even joking.
35200	37000	Banjo-Kazooie ruined my life.
39500	41100	Tons of people remember the quiz section
41100	44700	at the end of Banjo-Kazooie as being kind of unfair,
44700	48100	but really importantly, tons of people remember the quiz,
48100	50700	which is more than can be said for any section
50700	54200	of any of the old platforming collect-a-thons of the time.
54200	58200	Do you even remember Tonic Trouble or Bomberman Hero
58300	61400	or that shite-ass Earthworm Jim game
61400	63300	that came out that was 3D?
63300	67100	Does anyone remember Gex, Enter the Gecko?
67100	68700	Let's get it on!
68700	71800	It's tail time! It's tail time!
71800	73900	It's tail time! It's tail time!
73900	75100	What?
75100	77100	It's tail time!
77100	79600	I know what you're thinking. It's tail time.
79600	82800	I'm gonna need an explanation for this.
82800	84100	We can't go on like this.
84100	86100	This is madness.
86100	88000	Flash forward to 2017.
88000	90800	It's been a really long time since these games came out
90800	94100	and almost as long as the 3D platformer was really in fashion,
94100	96700	with basically only Mario as the last man standing
96700	98100	with this kind of gameplay,
98100	101000	outside, of course, of indie stuff.
101000	103200	One such piece of indie stuff is Yooka-Laylee,
103200	104800	created by Playtonic Games,
104800	106400	composed of folks who left Rareware
106400	109000	after seemingly getting sick of working under Microsoft,
109000	110500	making Kinect sports games
110500	112600	and putting out ports of their good stuff.
112600	115600	Yooka-Laylee is in a really difficult and weird place.
115600	118300	In going after a genre of game that was seemingly outgrown
118300	119700	well over a decade ago,
119700	122500	is bringing back these mechanics and systems really enough?
122500	125200	Or are there ways to adapt the formula to a modern setting
125200	127700	and make it better than it was even back in the day,
127700	130100	like Doom recently did for its originals?
130100	132500	♪♪
132500	135700	What the fuck does it's tail time mean?
135700	137300	What the fuck does it mean?
137300	140000	Does the lizard fuck Rob Cohen,
140000	141300	lead writer of Gex,
141300	143100	and to the fucking gecko,
143100	144500	does the lizard fuck?
144500	147000	Why would you do this, Robert?
147000	148300	Why would you do this?
148300	151000	♪♪
151000	173500	♪♪
173500	176100	I had a really good time with Yooka-Laylee.
176100	178700	You need to regain your hea-
178700	181000	Oh, God!
181000	183200	Oh, Jesus Christ!
183200	184700	Oh, oh, oh, oh!
184700	189200	♪♪
189200	191000	Ha ha ha ha ha!
191000	192700	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
192700	194300	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
194300	196200	The controls are incredible.
196200	198800	The basic walk feels fast enough to get you where you want to go,
198800	200000	as opposed to the originals,
200000	202300	where you would end up always using the talent trot.
202400	204900	The game's version of the trot uses energy now,
204900	207400	but it does this because it's now even faster,
207400	209900	and controls very differently from just a standard run.
209900	211700	You have something of a turning radius.
211700	214200	Getting good at using it just feels good.
214200	216800	The game makes mobility itself create a good feeling
216800	219100	in a way I haven't seen in quite a long time.
219100	221700	There's so much charm to almost every little thing.
221700	224800	There's so much variety to the character designs and their personalities
224800	226800	in a way that completely fits the original.
226800	228500	There's a bunch of snowmen in the snow level,
228500	231700	and one of them dresses like Gruntilda used to and talks in rhymes.
231700	234000	There are cute puns in all the names all over the place.
234000	238100	I especially like the sign who confuses you for a gardener or redecorator every level,
238100	239800	and he's called, like, Planker.
239800	240900	And then there's little things, too,
240900	243300	like the noises Laylee makes when you're doing the roll move.
243300	246600	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
246600	247600	It's beautiful.
247600	249600	It's—it's just cute.
249600	250900	The story's kind of cool.
250900	255700	You can really feel the seething hatred for the time the creators spent working under Microsoft.
255700	259400	The villain is a giant corporation run by Capital B.
259400	260800	Do you—do—
260800	262100	Do you get it?
262100	264300	Do—do you—do you underst—the ca—
265200	270100	Capital B's company, Hivery Towers, has built a giant sucking machine.
270100	271700	MUCH LIKE MICROSOFT
271700	273400	And it stole Yuko and Laylee's book.
273400	278000	To get it back, they have to infiltrate Hivery Towers to find and collect all the pages that fell out of it.
278000	279900	It's a pretty classic and simple setup,
279900	285100	but it works, and I enjoy the massive jabs at corporate structure that it takes.
285100	287200	I—I didn't expect that.
287200	289200	When I see Trowser, the snake,
289300	292200	I wonder how many years they waited to make that joke.
292200	296200	Like, I imagine him being on the cutting room floor of Conker or something, and they were like,
296200	301900	One day, we'll make the greatest anthropomorphic dick joke ever in the sequel if we ever get one.
301900	305500	And now, 32 years later, here he is!
305500	311900	Kirkhope, Wise, and Burke have done a fantastic job of blending the modern capabilities of game soundtracks
311900	316900	with the sensibilities that made their work on the older games consoles so special in the first place.
316900	321000	While it never feels like it does something truly beyond what the originals could do,
321000	325200	it feels like it's doing the sort of thing the originals would have done if they'd had the chance.
325200	330900	The creators patched out audiobook salesman and white nationalist JonTron's dialogue from the game,
330900	333900	which is a shame, because if there's one thing JonTron is good at,
333900	337400	it's making meaningless, incoherent noise into a microphone.
337400	341900	It must suck to discover that your favorite guys have been infected by communism.
341900	346000	The game is ultra-faithful to the design spec of the works it's throwing back to.
346000	350500	But the thing about this faithfulness is that it means all the problems I have with the previous games,
350500	355500	all the glaring issues that are even more clear in retrospect, are still present all this time later.
355500	358500	People who don't like the original games going back to them without nostalgia,
358500	362500	or who never really got them at the time, will not get Yooka-Laylee either.
362500	365700	It's another one of those games, good and bad.
365700	368900	However, there are some things about Yooka-Laylee that are really interesting.
368900	374500	In faithfully recreating a dead genre, it resurrects gameplay elements that were fun, or good, or useful,
374500	376500	but got lost in the mists of time.
376500	380000	So I thought I'd explore some of the elements that might be worth keeping around,
380000	382500	and reincorporating back into modern design.
382500	385000	Take, for example, the level transitions.
385000	390000	The originals needed a transition because you literally couldn't fit that much of a level in data.
390000	395500	A standard trick in game development at the time was to have the inside and outside be two separate areas entirely,
395500	401000	with a loading zone between them, or put a zone between two sections of the same area when it can be justified.
401000	406000	In Banjo-Tooie, the sequel, this makes the ascent up the Isle of Hags even more impressive
406000	410000	because the developers are successfully simulating climbing a giant mountain
410000	416500	with numerous quite small areas where modern games could just put the whole mountain there and have you climb it.
416500	420000	Yooka-Laylee is made in an era where you don't really need loading screens.
420000	423500	Modern consoles and PCs have much more memory and processing power,
423500	427500	and using strategic loading and unloading, you can have an entire seamless world
427500	432000	with careful loading between maps without ever, ever having to actually stop.
432000	434500	But Yooka-Laylee still has these transitions.
434500	439500	This shortcut to the top of a mountain is a transition when both pieces of the game world are physically there,
439500	442500	and nothing really needs to be loaded in and out.
442500	446500	This passage leads inside the mountain into a relatively small area
446500	450000	you could have just modeled inside the mountain and had you walk inside.
450000	452500	This design sensibility is throughout the game,
452500	457500	but the thing is, this isn't just reusing antiquated solutions to problems that don't exist anymore.
457500	461500	This kind of level design still has a kind of value of its own.
461500	466500	You could have a passage inside the mouth of this cave leading all the way up to the top,
466500	470500	but then this shortcut would be significantly longer, wouldn't it?
470500	474000	You would have to physically climb or walk or wait in an elevator.
474000	479500	The teleportation of sorts you get from having it just be a dark cave you walk into and come out at the top
479500	484500	is a really convenient time saver, something you want from a shortcut.
484500	486500	Keep notes, FromSoftware!
486500	491500	Something this era of games always did very well was lie to you.
491500	494500	You went into a building, and it was bigger on the inside.
494500	498500	Was this a mistake? An accident? Did someone fuck up on the blueprints?
498500	501500	No. They did it because they thought it was better that way.
501500	505500	They didn't have to be constrained by what the outside of the building looked like
505500	509000	because you were in a different map, ruled by different constraints.
509000	512000	The world of Banjo-Kazooie was almost a literal cartoon
512000	515500	whose shape changed as it was needed to suit the gameplay.
515500	519500	The inside of Duke's Temple is a different shape and size from the outside,
519500	524000	something only manageable when both areas are bespoke and separated by a transition.
524000	528000	So even though these design elements were used to avoid limitations of the original hardware,
528000	533500	there is a genuine, noticeable advantage in these elements, even when those limitations are removed.
533500	538000	The other thing these games have is purposefulness in their controls.
538000	541000	You are fully responsible for everything the character does.
541000	545000	Modern game design seeks to simplify a lot of the experience of controlling a character.
545000	547000	This looks really cool, doesn't it?
552000	554000	I'm holding forwards.
568000	570000	I can't wait to fight you again.
592000	594000	Game design.
594000	598500	You run Ezio or Altair or any of the shitty, unmemorable characters that came afterwards
598500	601000	towards a ledge holding the do cool shit button,
601000	604000	and he runs and jumps and climbs all over the shop.
605500	608000	This isn't gameplay.
608000	612000	Assassin's Creed is almost the closest thing the collect-a-thon has to a successor,
612000	614000	what with all the collecting you're doing,
614000	618000	but it's really unengaging because most of the work is done by Altezzio for you.
618000	619500	You just point him at the thing.
619500	622500	The same is true of games like Uncharted or Tomb Raider and so on.
622500	624000	These games aren't necessarily bad,
624000	627000	but they've moved the simple fun of controlling the character
627000	629500	to navigate challenges into the background,
629500	631500	and that's not always a good thing.
631500	634500	In old platformers, every move was deliberate.
634500	636500	You have to keep yourself on a ledge here.
636500	638500	It's easy to fall off or miss a jump,
638500	641500	and this makes landing the jump correctly satisfying.
641500	644000	The supposed simplification of the mechanics of a game
644000	649000	has removed some of the more crunchy and interesting and satisfying elements of the actual games.
649000	653000	I honestly spent the first couple of hours of Yooka-Laylee feeling flabbergasted
653000	656500	that, for the first time in ages, I was pressing a button to jump
656500	658500	and then moving to where I wanted to move,
658500	661000	using my own abilities to control the character
661000	663500	instead of pointing them at the thing and letting them do whatever.
663500	667000	And also, like when I first replayed Banjo-Kazooie a little while ago,
667000	669500	I kept staring at the corner of the screen.
669500	673000	I wondered why, but then when I was playing Shady Morty to get this footage,
673000	674500	I realized why.
674500	679000	I was looking for the mini-map to tell me where to go to do the stuff I was supposed to do.
679000	682000	I think one reason the levels in these games are more memorable,
682000	686000	literally stick out in your mind so well you could take a quiz about them,
686000	689000	is because they're built around leading you around with their design
689000	692000	and encouraging a real sense of curiosity about them.
692000	697000	It's very rare for any aspect of the landscapes of modern games to really pop out at you,
697000	700500	existing as mostly giant empty spaces you navigate with a GPS
700500	703000	telling you where all the interesting stuff is already.
703000	708000	Making your world interesting to simply explore and look and see and find things for yourself
708000	712000	instead of the thing you pass through on the way to the interesting stuff marked on the map
712000	716000	is a really good idea, which, outside of Yooka-Laylee and Breath of the Wild,
716000	720000	is a practice going unfortunately forgotten in many modern game genres.
720500	723000	The game itself isn't perfect, even though I really enjoyed it
723000	727000	and was capable of looking past the flaws the way I looked past them back in the day.
727000	730000	It deliberately embraces many of the trappings and conventions of a genre
730000	732000	that probably went away for a reason,
732000	736500	but it contains elements of design and execution that can still be learned from.
736500	741000	The wealth of design possibilities opened up by placing level design and convenience for the player
741000	743000	over physical coherence,
743000	748000	the joyful freedom of a simple but nice-feeling control scheme that takes skill to master properly,
748000	752500	the memorable adventure of exploring a space and scouring it for stuff by yourself
752500	754500	without anyone telling you where anything is,
754500	757500	having to actually look using ingenuity to find,
757500	760500	consequently forcing you, without even noticing,
760500	765500	to memorize the landscape of a location until you can see it in your head when you shut your eyes.
766000	766500	No!
768000	768500	No!
768500	772500	And, most importantly, putting eyes on everything.
773000	774000	Everything.
774000	775500	EVERYTHING!
775500	777000	Those are just eyes.
777000	782500	They walk around, and they find stuff to possess, and then it becomes their body.
782500	785000	Jesus Christ, even the fucking logo has eyes now.
785000	787000	Is everyone alright down there at Playtonic?
787500	789500	Do you need help?
789500	791000	Can I help you?
791000	795500	Perhaps the collect-a-thons of old can't really exist in the modern day without being altered so much
795500	797500	they don't really resemble themselves anymore.
797500	802000	But, within that old style, there lies all kinds of useful little...
802000	807500	pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of gaming that are worth keeping around.
808000	810500	Yooka-Laylee's Choices are just another...
810500	812000	page...
812000	814000	in the book...
814000	816500	of game design.
