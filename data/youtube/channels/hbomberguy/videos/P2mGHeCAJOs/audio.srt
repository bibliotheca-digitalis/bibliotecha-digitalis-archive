00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Banjo-Kazooie was one of my favorite games as a kid.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay, that's not quite true.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,500
Growing up, it was terrifying.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,900
The way the level transitioned into that fucking painting,

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,200
it scared the shit out of me.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,800
This giant head just looking at you.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,000
And that happens again!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Oh, the music that plays when you're in the water

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,500
and the fucking shark starts chasing you.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
It still makes me tense up thinking about it.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,500
The sea mine with eyes that hated you so much

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,600
he would go for you and explode and die

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,300
just to take a single honeycomb off your life bar

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,900
gave me actual nightmares as a kid.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm not even joking.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,000
Banjo-Kazooie ruined my life.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,100
Tons of people remember the quiz section

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,700
at the end of Banjo-Kazooie as being kind of unfair,

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
but really importantly, tons of people remember the quiz,

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,700
which is more than can be said for any section

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,200
of any of the old platforming collect-a-thons of the time.

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Do you even remember Tonic Trouble or Bomberman Hero

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,400
or that shite-ass Earthworm Jim game

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,300
that came out that was 3D?

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,100
Does anyone remember Gex, Enter the Gecko?

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,700
Let's get it on!

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,800
It's tail time! It's tail time!

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,900
It's tail time! It's tail time!

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,100
What?

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
It's tail time!

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,600
I know what you're thinking. It's tail time.

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm gonna need an explanation for this.

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,100
We can't go on like this.

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
This is madness.

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,000
Flash forward to 2017.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
It's been a really long time since these games came out

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,100
and almost as long as the 3D platformer was really in fashion,

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,700
with basically only Mario as the last man standing

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,100
with this kind of gameplay,

40
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,000
outside, of course, of indie stuff.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,200
One such piece of indie stuff is Yooka-Laylee,

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
created by Playtonic Games,

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
composed of folks who left Rareware

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
after seemingly getting sick of working under Microsoft,

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,500
making Kinect sports games

46
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,600
and putting out ports of their good stuff.

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Yooka-Laylee is in a really difficult and weird place.

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,300
In going after a genre of game that was seemingly outgrown

49

well over a decade ago,

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,500
is bringing back these mechanics and systems really enough?

51
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,200
Or are there ways to adapt the formula to a modern setting

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,700
and make it better than it was even back in the day,

The basic walk feels fast enough to get you where you want to go,

as opposed to the originals,

77

where you would end up always using the talent trot.

78

The game's version of the trot uses energy now,

but it does this because it's now even faster,

80

You have something of a turning radius.

Getting good at using it just feels good.

83

There's so much variety to the character designs and their personalities

in a way that completely fits the original.

88
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,500
There's a bunch of snowmen in the snow level,

89
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,700
and one of them dresses like Gruntilda used to and talks in rhymes.

and he's called, like, Planker.

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,900
And then there's little things, too,

94

The story's kind of cool.

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,700
You can really feel the seething hatred for the time the creators spent working under Microsoft.

100
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,400
The villain is a giant corporation run by Capital B.

101

Do—do you—do you underst—the ca—

104
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,100
Capital B's company, Hivery Towers, has built a giant sucking machine.

105
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,700
MUCH LIKE MICROSOFT

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
And it stole Yuko and Laylee's book.

107
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,000
To get it back, they have to infiltrate Hivery Towers to find and collect all the pages that fell out of it.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,900
It's a pretty classic and simple setup,

109
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,100
but it works, and I enjoy the massive jabs at corporate structure that it takes.

110
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
I—I didn't expect that.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
When I see Trowser, the snake,

112
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,200
I wonder how many years they waited to make that joke.

113
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Like, I imagine him being on the cutting room floor of Conker or something, and they were like,

114
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,900
One day, we'll make the greatest anthropomorphic dick joke ever in the sequel if we ever get one.

115
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,500
And now, 32 years later, here he is!

116
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,900
Kirkhope, Wise, and Burke have done a fantastic job of blending the modern capabilities of game soundtracks

117
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,900
with the sensibilities that made their work on the older games consoles so special in the first place.

118
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,000
While it never feels like it does something truly beyond what the originals could do,

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,200
it feels like it's doing the sort of thing the originals would have done if they'd had the chance.

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,900
The creators patched out audiobook salesman and white nationalist JonTron's dialogue from the game,

121
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,900
which is a shame, because if there's one thing JonTron is good at,

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,400
it's making meaningless, incoherent noise into a microphone.

123
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,900
It must suck to discover that your favorite guys have been infected by communism.

124
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,000
The game is ultra-faithful to the design spec of the works it's throwing back to.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,500
But the thing about this faithfulness is that it means all the problems I have with the previous games,

126
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
all the glaring issues that are even more clear in retrospect, are still present all this time later.

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
People who don't like the original games going back to them without nostalgia,

128
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
or who never really got them at the time, will not get Yooka-Laylee either.

129
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,700
It's another one of those games, good and bad.

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,900
However, there are some things about Yooka-Laylee that are really interesting.

131
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,500
In faithfully recreating a dead genre, it resurrects gameplay elements that were fun, or good, or useful,

132
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
but got lost in the mists of time.

133
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,000
So I thought I'd explore some of the elements that might be worth keeping around,

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
and reincorporating back into modern design.

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,000
Take, for example, the level transitions.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The originals needed a transition because you literally couldn't fit that much of a level in data.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,500
A standard trick in game development at the time was to have the inside and outside be two separate areas entirely,

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,000
with a loading zone between them, or put a zone between two sections of the same area when it can be justified.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In Banjo-Tooie, the sequel, this makes the ascent up the Isle of Hags even more impressive

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
because the developers are successfully simulating climbing a giant mountain

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,500
with numerous quite small areas where modern games could just put the whole mountain there and have you climb it.

142
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Yooka-Laylee is made in an era where you don't really need loading screens.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,500
Modern consoles and PCs have much more memory and processing power,

144
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
and using strategic loading and unloading, you can have an entire seamless world

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,000
with careful loading between maps without ever, ever having to actually stop.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
But Yooka-Laylee still has these transitions.

147
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,500
This shortcut to the top of a mountain is a transition when both pieces of the game world are physically there,

148
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
and nothing really needs to be loaded in and out.

149
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
This passage leads inside the mountain into a relatively small area

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,000
you could have just modeled inside the mountain and had you walk inside.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,500
This design sensibility is throughout the game,

152
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,500
but the thing is, this isn't just reusing antiquated solutions to problems that don't exist anymore.

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
This kind of level design still has a kind of value of its own.

154
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
You could have a passage inside the mouth of this cave leading all the way up to the top,

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
but then this shortcut would be significantly longer, wouldn't it?

156
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,000
You would have to physically climb or walk or wait in an elevator.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,500
The teleportation of sorts you get from having it just be a dark cave you walk into and come out at the top

158
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
is a really convenient time saver, something you want from a shortcut.

159
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Keep notes, FromSoftware!

160
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Something this era of games always did very well was lie to you.

161
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
You went into a building, and it was bigger on the inside.

162
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Was this a mistake? An accident? Did someone fuck up on the blueprints?

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
No. They did it because they thought it was better that way.

164
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
They didn't have to be constrained by what the outside of the building looked like

165
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,000
because you were in a different map, ruled by different constraints.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The world of Banjo-Kazooie was almost a literal cartoon

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,500
whose shape changed as it was needed to suit the gameplay.

168
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
The inside of Duke's Temple is a different shape and size from the outside,

169
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,000
something only manageable when both areas are bespoke and separated by a transition.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So even though these design elements were used to avoid limitations of the original hardware,

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,500
there is a genuine, noticeable advantage in these elements, even when those limitations are removed.

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,000
The other thing these games have is purposefulness in their controls.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are fully responsible for everything the character does.

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Modern game design seeks to simplify a lot of the experience of controlling a character.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This looks really cool, doesn't it?

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm holding forwards.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can't wait to fight you again.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Game design.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,500
You run Ezio or Altair or any of the shitty, unmemorable characters that came afterwards

180
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,000
towards a ledge holding the do cool shit button,

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and he runs and jumps and climbs all over the shop.

182
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,000
This isn't gameplay.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Assassin's Creed is almost the closest thing the collect-a-thon has to a successor,

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
what with all the collecting you're doing,

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but it's really unengaging because most of the work is done by Altezzio for you.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
You just point him at the thing.

187
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
The same is true of games like Uncharted or Tomb Raider and so on.

188
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
These games aren't necessarily bad,

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but they've moved the simple fun of controlling the character

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,500
to navigate challenges into the background,

191
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
and that's not always a good thing.

192
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
In old platformers, every move was deliberate.

193
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
You have to keep yourself on a ledge here.

194
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
It's easy to fall off or miss a jump,

195
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
and this makes landing the jump correctly satisfying.

196
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,000
The supposed simplification of the mechanics of a game

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
has removed some of the more crunchy and interesting and satisfying elements of the actual games.

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I honestly spent the first couple of hours of Yooka-Laylee feeling flabbergasted

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,500
that, for the first time in ages, I was pressing a button to jump

200
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
and then moving to where I wanted to move,

201
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
using my own abilities to control the character

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,500
instead of pointing them at the thing and letting them do whatever.

203
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,000
And also, like when I first replayed Banjo-Kazooie a little while ago,

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
I kept staring at the corner of the screen.

205
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,000
I wondered why, but then when I was playing Shady Morty to get this footage,

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
I realized why.

207
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,000
I was looking for the mini-map to tell me where to go to do the stuff I was supposed to do.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think one reason the levels in these games are more memorable,

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
literally stick out in your mind so well you could take a quiz about them,

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
is because they're built around leading you around with their design

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and encouraging a real sense of curiosity about them.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's very rare for any aspect of the landscapes of modern games to really pop out at you,

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,500
existing as mostly giant empty spaces you navigate with a GPS

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,000
telling you where all the interesting stuff is already.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Making your world interesting to simply explore and look and see and find things for yourself

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
instead of the thing you pass through on the way to the interesting stuff marked on the map

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
is a really good idea, which, outside of Yooka-Laylee and Breath of the Wild,

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is a practice going unfortunately forgotten in many modern game genres.

219
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,000
The game itself isn't perfect, even though I really enjoyed it

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and was capable of looking past the flaws the way I looked past them back in the day.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It deliberately embraces many of the trappings and conventions of a genre

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that probably went away for a reason,

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,500
but it contains elements of design and execution that can still be learned from.

224
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,000
The wealth of design possibilities opened up by placing level design and convenience for the player

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
over physical coherence,

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the joyful freedom of a simple but nice-feeling control scheme that takes skill to master properly,

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,500
the memorable adventure of exploring a space and scouring it for stuff by yourself

228
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
without anyone telling you where anything is,

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
having to actually look using ingenuity to find,

230
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
consequently forcing you, without even noticing,

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,500
to memorize the landscape of a location until you can see it in your head when you shut your eyes.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,500
No!

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,500
No!

234
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
And, most importantly, putting eyes on everything.

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Everything.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
EVERYTHING!

237
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Those are just eyes.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,500
They walk around, and they find stuff to possess, and then it becomes their body.

239
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,000
Jesus Christ, even the fucking logo has eyes now.

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Is everyone alright down there at Playtonic?

241
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Do you need help?

242
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,000
Can I help you?

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,500
Perhaps the collect-a-thons of old can't really exist in the modern day without being altered so much

244
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
they don't really resemble themselves anymore.

245
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,000
But, within that old style, there lies all kinds of useful little...

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,500
pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of gaming that are worth keeping around.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Yooka-Laylee's Choices are just another...

248
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
page...

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
in the book...

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
of game design.
