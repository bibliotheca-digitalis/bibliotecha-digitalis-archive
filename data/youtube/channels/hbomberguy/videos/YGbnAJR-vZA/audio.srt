1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
Let me...

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,220
TELL YOU ABOUT VIDEO GAME FEMINISM!

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,200
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,700
AH-

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,100
hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo conjugate

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,860
I know what you're all thinking

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,740
How could it possibly cost $15,000 a month to make a documentary about a lady in a flannel shirt?

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,820
I mean look at the great production value in this short film, written by David Sorrene

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
Nah man, you gotta get the hell out of here

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
I can't hear them, are they talking about the wind?

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,320
It's really windy here!

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Lust and the Time of Heartache had great production values, and it only cost $10,000 to make!

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,320
We will strive to leave all political baggage at the door and simply report the truth as we fi-

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:56,320
I have decided that it is best for me, and best for the project, that I terminate my working relationship with David Sorrene

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,820
It is my right, and my responsibility, to terminate a director if I feel that they are not right for the project

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
What?

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Firing David Sorrene as director?

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,820
But what could David possibly have done to deserve such a thing?

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,820
It's so unexpected that someone wouldn't want to get along with someone who says things like this!

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
You're a nigger

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
And you know you're a nigger

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
And you hate yourself

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,320
But instead of looking in the mirror, you blame Whitey

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,320
But wait! The plot thickens!

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Davis recently put up an article of his own, called Jordan Owen Has Split the Sarkeesian Effect

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Or, its original title, which was hastily edited, Jordan Owen Has Absconded with the Budget from the Sarkeesian Effect

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,320
At least, that's what it seems like, given that the article's URL reads

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Jordan Owen Absconed Budget Sarkeesian Effect?

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
What?

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Can you really not spell the name of the person you're criticizing?

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
Oh my god!

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
This documentary's gonna be amazing!

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,820
In the article, Lorini claims the problem started because Jordan Owen doesn't know how to relate to women

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
What a shocking revelation!

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
I would never have noticed Jordan Owen has a problem with women!

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,820
And I'll tell you right now, my favorite dancer at my favorite club is Molly at Tattletales

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Go look her up and you'll find out why

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
And when a man who says stuff like,

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Women, in our culture, have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
thinks you're bad with women, you know there's a problem

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Orini also did the totally adult thing and put the skyplogs of the entire breakup online for all to see

42
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,320
With friends like these, who needs Anita Sarkeesian?

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,320
But to make matters worse, everyone's favorite contributor,

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,820
Davis Orini's super important toy skull he wants to make sure you know he has because he moves it between shots,

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
isn't in any of his later videos

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,820
Where's MacArthur gone?

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
And yes, that's its name, he named it

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
He gave his toy skull a name, like, like a person

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
He fucking names his skulls, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

50
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,320
Could it be that he caved in to the degenerates who thought it made him look a little silly?

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,820
No, of course not!

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,320
He merely substituted it for a different prop, one that far better establishes what sort of person Orini is

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,820
A book on screenwriting 101!

54
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
What you need is a struggle

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
An enemy to overcome

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
It's pain that defines the masculine

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
It's pain that makes us who we are

58
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Embrace it

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Thanks, Rob Tobin!

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Time to fix myself a rye whiskey and head out to my car I bought with the Patreon money to record a new video

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Drinking liquor in a car has never been a bad idea, right guys?

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
But don't worry about Davis getting in a car accident though, folks, he's got it under control

63
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,820
He never actually drinks more than a thimble full of the stuff in most of his videos and just sort of pretends to drink it

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,820
The important thing is making people think you're cool, even if you have to dress like a pirate to do it

65
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And let's not forget the Jews

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
Lord have mercy, let's not forget the Jews

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Get it together, guys!

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
I mean, even Mundane Matt thinks you should do it

69
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
And he's a genius, wait

70
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Is that his logo?

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Is...

72
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
What is it with these people and skulls?

73
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
Are we the baddies?

74
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
I have not made these white ashtrays

75
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Don't worry though, I'm sure at some point in the near future they'll realize how shitty and needlessly argumentative this makes them and their project look

76
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And they'll pretend to be friends again to try and save face

77
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,820
No way, that already happened!

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Owen Arrini Productions is back in business

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Oh my god, Sony Vegas editing, it's so amazing

80
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Reunite!

81
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Oh, it's gone

82
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
It's okay, we're all friends again, honest

83
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Can you please all un-lose all respect you ever had for this project, please?

84
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Thank you very much

85
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
We're in good company with this

86
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
Look up the production of the...

87
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
I believe the first Godfather movie

88
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
So we're not alone

89
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
I think I'm having a heart attack, seriously

90
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
My heart hurts

91
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
I can't take this

92
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,820
He's comparing himself to Francis Ford fucking Coppola

93
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
The apocalypse is now for me

94
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
My heart is killing me

95
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Oh Jesus Christ

96
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Hey Jordan, remember that time I said

97
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
I hope Owen realizes that he's hitting rock bottom

98
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
That he can't continue to go on like this

99
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
And that he makes amends and starts working on becoming a kinder

100
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
More considerate and more responsible person

101
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
Well I was just kidding, everything's fine

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Remember those times I directly compared you to Elliot fucking Roger?

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Go watch Jordan's video on Roach

104
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
It's an hour long and it's very tedious

105
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,820
But you'll see these occasional glimpses of Elliot Roger

106
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,820
He wound up going completely Elliot Rogers as I was driving him to the airport

107
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Well that was also just kidding

108
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
This project is fine

109
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Well that's just great

110
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Good to see the project's back on track

111
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
The train track to

112
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Successfully defeating basic critical theory

113
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Cheers guys

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
Seriously that's how much he drinks at a time

115
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Go and check his videos

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Fucking seriously

117
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
You know I'm not going to look at myself

118
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
I'm not going to improve myself

119
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
I'm not going to try and benefit my community

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Or grow something good and positive

121
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
No

122
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,820
I'm going to blame others for my failings

123
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
And then

124
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
And then I'm going to go hurt those others

125
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
And say they deserved it

126
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Because I'm a failure, they deserve to hurt

127
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Jordan Owen and David Serrini have worked closely together for months

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
And even they can't decide if they like each other or not

129
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
Why should we trust what they have to say about a woman who

130
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,820
They haven't even met

131
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Who at most has made a couple of hours of video footage

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
And whose name they can't even fucking spell

133
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Guys

134
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
Guys

135
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
You look like twats

136
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
It's all Whitey's fault

137
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
It's all slavery

138
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Slavery even though it ended 150 years ago

139
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Is still holding my people down

140
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Overall I'm just glad to see this little lover's tiff is over

141
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
I mean, seriously, what restraint

142
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
On the part of Jordan Owen to

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Still be friends with someone and work with them on a documentary

144
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
After they directly compare you to Elliot Rodger

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
And make fun of you to the whole world and leak skype logs

146
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
And say you have horrible, horrible brain problems

147
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
And gaslight you

148
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,820
I mean

149
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Comparing someone to Elliot Rodger is

150
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
The sort of shitty thing that I would do

151
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
In fact I did do it

152
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Does that mean we'll be friends next?

153
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
I gotta get out of here

154
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
I'm going in first gear

155
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I'm going really fucking slow

156
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
This isn't actually very good at all

157
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Seriously

158
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm not even listening to music

159
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
I'm gonna dub it in post

160
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
But it'll sound like I'm listening to music

161
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
And you'll think I'm cool, right?

162
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
I gotta get out of here

163
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Fuck
