0	1220	Let me...
1220	5220	TELL YOU ABOUT VIDEO GAME FEMINISM!
5220	8200	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
8200	8700	AH-
8700	14100	hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo conjugate
14680	15860	I know what you're all thinking
15860	21740	How could it possibly cost $15,000 a month to make a documentary about a lady in a flannel shirt?
22120	26820	I mean look at the great production value in this short film, written by David Sorrene
26820	28820	Nah man, you gotta get the hell out of here
28820	30820	I can't hear them, are they talking about the wind?
30820	32320	It's really windy here!
32320	39320	Lust and the Time of Heartache had great production values, and it only cost $10,000 to make!
39320	43320	We will strive to leave all political baggage at the door and simply report the truth as we fi-
44320	56320	I have decided that it is best for me, and best for the project, that I terminate my working relationship with David Sorrene
56320	63820	It is my right, and my responsibility, to terminate a director if I feel that they are not right for the project
63820	65820	What?
65820	68820	Firing David Sorrene as director?
68820	72820	But what could David possibly have done to deserve such a thing?
72820	78820	It's so unexpected that someone wouldn't want to get along with someone who says things like this!
78820	80820	You're a nigger
80820	82820	And you know you're a nigger
82820	84820	And you hate yourself
85320	88320	But instead of looking in the mirror, you blame Whitey
88320	91320	But wait! The plot thickens!
91320	96320	Davis recently put up an article of his own, called Jordan Owen Has Split the Sarkeesian Effect
96320	102320	Or, its original title, which was hastily edited, Jordan Owen Has Absconded with the Budget from the Sarkeesian Effect
102320	106320	At least, that's what it seems like, given that the article's URL reads
106320	112320	Jordan Owen Absconed Budget Sarkeesian Effect?
112820	114820	What?
114820	118820	Can you really not spell the name of the person you're criticizing?
118820	120820	Oh my god!
122820	124820	This documentary's gonna be amazing!
124820	130820	In the article, Lorini claims the problem started because Jordan Owen doesn't know how to relate to women
130820	132820	What a shocking revelation!
132820	135820	I would never have noticed Jordan Owen has a problem with women!
135820	139820	And I'll tell you right now, my favorite dancer at my favorite club is Molly at Tattletales
139820	141820	Go look her up and you'll find out why
141820	143820	And when a man who says stuff like,
143820	147820	Women, in our culture, have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome
147820	150820	thinks you're bad with women, you know there's a problem
150820	156820	Orini also did the totally adult thing and put the skyplogs of the entire breakup online for all to see
156820	160320	With friends like these, who needs Anita Sarkeesian?
160320	163320	But to make matters worse, everyone's favorite contributor,
163320	168820	Davis Orini's super important toy skull he wants to make sure you know he has because he moves it between shots,
168820	170820	isn't in any of his later videos
171320	172820	Where's MacArthur gone?
172820	174820	And yes, that's its name, he named it
174820	177820	He gave his toy skull a name, like, like a person
177820	180820	He fucking names his skulls, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
180820	185320	Could it be that he caved in to the degenerates who thought it made him look a little silly?
185320	186820	No, of course not!
186820	192320	He merely substituted it for a different prop, one that far better establishes what sort of person Orini is
192320	194820	A book on screenwriting 101!
194820	197820	What you need is a struggle
201820	203820	An enemy to overcome
205820	207820	It's pain that defines the masculine
211820	213820	It's pain that makes us who we are
214820	215820	Embrace it
215820	217820	Thanks, Rob Tobin!
217820	223820	Time to fix myself a rye whiskey and head out to my car I bought with the Patreon money to record a new video
223820	227820	Drinking liquor in a car has never been a bad idea, right guys?
227820	231820	But don't worry about Davis getting in a car accident though, folks, he's got it under control
231820	236820	He never actually drinks more than a thimble full of the stuff in most of his videos and just sort of pretends to drink it
236820	242820	The important thing is making people think you're cool, even if you have to dress like a pirate to do it
242820	244820	And let's not forget the Jews
244820	247820	Lord have mercy, let's not forget the Jews
247820	248820	Get it together, guys!
248820	251820	I mean, even Mundane Matt thinks you should do it
251820	253820	And he's a genius, wait
253820	255820	Is that his logo?
255820	256820	Is...
256820	259820	What is it with these people and skulls?
260820	262820	Are we the baddies?
262820	264820	I have not made these white ashtrays
264820	270820	Don't worry though, I'm sure at some point in the near future they'll realize how shitty and needlessly argumentative this makes them and their project look
270820	273820	And they'll pretend to be friends again to try and save face
273820	274820	No way, that already happened!
274820	277820	Owen Arrini Productions is back in business
279820	283820	Oh my god, Sony Vegas editing, it's so amazing
283820	285820	Reunite!
285820	286820	Oh, it's gone
286820	288820	It's okay, we're all friends again, honest
288820	293820	Can you please all un-lose all respect you ever had for this project, please?
293820	295820	Thank you very much
295820	297820	We're in good company with this
297820	299820	Look up the production of the...
299820	301820	I believe the first Godfather movie
301820	302820	So we're not alone
310820	313820	I think I'm having a heart attack, seriously
313820	315820	My heart hurts
315820	317820	I can't take this
318820	322820	He's comparing himself to Francis Ford fucking Coppola
323820	326820	The apocalypse is now for me
326820	328820	My heart is killing me
328820	330820	Oh Jesus Christ
330820	332820	Hey Jordan, remember that time I said
332820	335820	I hope Owen realizes that he's hitting rock bottom
335820	337820	That he can't continue to go on like this
337820	340820	And that he makes amends and starts working on becoming a kinder
340820	343820	More considerate and more responsible person
343820	345820	Well I was just kidding, everything's fine
345820	349820	Remember those times I directly compared you to Elliot fucking Roger?
349820	352820	Go watch Jordan's video on Roach
352820	354820	It's an hour long and it's very tedious
354820	358820	But you'll see these occasional glimpses of Elliot Roger
358820	362820	He wound up going completely Elliot Rogers as I was driving him to the airport
362820	365820	Well that was also just kidding
365820	367820	This project is fine
367820	368820	Well that's just great
368820	370820	Good to see the project's back on track
370820	372820	The train track to
372820	375820	Successfully defeating basic critical theory
375820	377820	Cheers guys
381820	383820	Seriously that's how much he drinks at a time
383820	385820	Go and check his videos
385820	387820	Fucking seriously
393820	395820	You know I'm not going to look at myself
395820	397820	I'm not going to improve myself
397820	399820	I'm not going to try and benefit my community
399820	402820	Or grow something good and positive
402820	403820	No
403820	407820	I'm going to blame others for my failings
407820	409820	And then
409820	411820	And then I'm going to go hurt those others
411820	413820	And say they deserved it
413820	416820	Because I'm a failure, they deserve to hurt
419820	423820	Jordan Owen and David Serrini have worked closely together for months
423820	426820	And even they can't decide if they like each other or not
426820	429820	Why should we trust what they have to say about a woman who
429820	430820	They haven't even met
430820	433820	Who at most has made a couple of hours of video footage
433820	436820	And whose name they can't even fucking spell
436820	438820	Guys
438820	440820	Guys
440820	442820	You look like twats
442820	444820	It's all Whitey's fault
444820	445820	It's all slavery
445820	448820	Slavery even though it ended 150 years ago
448820	450820	Is still holding my people down
450820	453820	Overall I'm just glad to see this little lover's tiff is over
453820	456820	I mean, seriously, what restraint
456820	458820	On the part of Jordan Owen to
458820	461820	Still be friends with someone and work with them on a documentary
461820	464820	After they directly compare you to Elliot Rodger
464820	467820	And make fun of you to the whole world and leak skype logs
467820	471820	And say you have horrible, horrible brain problems
471820	473820	And gaslight you
473820	474820	I mean
474820	476820	Comparing someone to Elliot Rodger is
476820	478820	The sort of shitty thing that I would do
478820	480820	In fact I did do it
480820	482820	Does that mean we'll be friends next?
485820	487820	I gotta get out of here
511820	513820	I'm going in first gear
513820	514820	I'm going really fucking slow
514820	516820	This isn't actually very good at all
516820	517820	Seriously
517820	519820	I'm not even listening to music
519820	520820	I'm gonna dub it in post
520820	522820	But it'll sound like I'm listening to music
522820	524820	And you'll think I'm cool, right?
526820	528820	I gotta get out of here
531820	532820	Fuck
