00:00.000 --> 00:01.220
Let me...

00:01.220 --> 00:05.220
TELL YOU ABOUT VIDEO GAME FEMINISM!

00:05.220 --> 00:08.200
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

00:08.200 --> 00:08.700
AH-

00:08.700 --> 00:14.100
hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo conjugate

00:14.680 --> 00:15.860
I know what you're all thinking

00:15.860 --> 00:21.740
How could it possibly cost $15,000 a month to make a documentary about a lady in a flannel shirt?

00:22.120 --> 00:26.820
I mean look at the great production value in this short film, written by David Sorrene

00:26.820 --> 00:28.820
Nah man, you gotta get the hell out of here

00:28.820 --> 00:30.820
I can't hear them, are they talking about the wind?

00:30.820 --> 00:32.320
It's really windy here!

00:32.320 --> 00:39.320
Lust and the Time of Heartache had great production values, and it only cost $10,000 to make!

00:39.320 --> 00:43.320
We will strive to leave all political baggage at the door and simply report the truth as we fi-

00:44.320 --> 00:56.320
I have decided that it is best for me, and best for the project, that I terminate my working relationship with David Sorrene

00:56.320 --> 01:03.820
It is my right, and my responsibility, to terminate a director if I feel that they are not right for the project

01:03.820 --> 01:05.820
What?

01:05.820 --> 01:08.820
Firing David Sorrene as director?

01:08.820 --> 01:12.820
But what could David possibly have done to deserve such a thing?

01:12.820 --> 01:18.820
It's so unexpected that someone wouldn't want to get along with someone who says things like this!

01:18.820 --> 01:20.820
You're a nigger

01:20.820 --> 01:22.820
And you know you're a nigger

01:22.820 --> 01:24.820
And you hate yourself

01:25.320 --> 01:28.320
But instead of looking in the mirror, you blame Whitey

01:28.320 --> 01:31.320
But wait! The plot thickens!

01:31.320 --> 01:36.320
Davis recently put up an article of his own, called Jordan Owen Has Split the Sarkeesian Effect

01:36.320 --> 01:42.320
Or, its original title, which was hastily edited, Jordan Owen Has Absconded with the Budget from the Sarkeesian Effect

01:42.320 --> 01:46.320
At least, that's what it seems like, given that the article's URL reads

01:46.320 --> 01:52.320
Jordan Owen Absconed Budget Sarkeesian Effect?

01:52.820 --> 01:54.820
What?

01:54.820 --> 01:58.820
Can you really not spell the name of the person you're criticizing?

01:58.820 --> 02:00.820
Oh my god!

02:02.820 --> 02:04.820
This documentary's gonna be amazing!

02:04.820 --> 02:10.820
In the article, Lorini claims the problem started because Jordan Owen doesn't know how to relate to women

02:10.820 --> 02:12.820
What a shocking revelation!

02:12.820 --> 02:15.820
I would never have noticed Jordan Owen has a problem with women!

02:15.820 --> 02:19.820
And I'll tell you right now, my favorite dancer at my favorite club is Molly at Tattletales

02:19.820 --> 02:21.820
Go look her up and you'll find out why

02:21.820 --> 02:23.820
And when a man who says stuff like,

02:23.820 --> 02:27.820
Women, in our culture, have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome

02:27.820 --> 02:30.820
thinks you're bad with women, you know there's a problem

02:30.820 --> 02:36.820
Orini also did the totally adult thing and put the skyplogs of the entire breakup online for all to see

02:36.820 --> 02:40.320
With friends like these, who needs Anita Sarkeesian?

02:40.320 --> 02:43.320
But to make matters worse, everyone's favorite contributor,

02:43.320 --> 02:48.820
Davis Orini's super important toy skull he wants to make sure you know he has because he moves it between shots,

02:48.820 --> 02:50.820
isn't in any of his later videos

02:51.320 --> 02:52.820
Where's MacArthur gone?

02:52.820 --> 02:54.820
And yes, that's its name, he named it

02:54.820 --> 02:57.820
He gave his toy skull a name, like, like a person

02:57.820 --> 03:00.820
He fucking names his skulls, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

03:00.820 --> 03:05.320
Could it be that he caved in to the degenerates who thought it made him look a little silly?

03:05.320 --> 03:06.820
No, of course not!

03:06.820 --> 03:12.320
He merely substituted it for a different prop, one that far better establishes what sort of person Orini is

03:12.320 --> 03:14.820
A book on screenwriting 101!

03:14.820 --> 03:17.820
What you need is a struggle

03:21.820 --> 03:23.820
An enemy to overcome

03:25.820 --> 03:27.820
It's pain that defines the masculine

03:31.820 --> 03:33.820
It's pain that makes us who we are

03:34.820 --> 03:35.820
Embrace it

03:35.820 --> 03:37.820
Thanks, Rob Tobin!

03:37.820 --> 03:43.820
Time to fix myself a rye whiskey and head out to my car I bought with the Patreon money to record a new video

03:43.820 --> 03:47.820
Drinking liquor in a car has never been a bad idea, right guys?

03:47.820 --> 03:51.820
But don't worry about Davis getting in a car accident though, folks, he's got it under control

03:51.820 --> 03:56.820
He never actually drinks more than a thimble full of the stuff in most of his videos and just sort of pretends to drink it

03:56.820 --> 04:02.820
The important thing is making people think you're cool, even if you have to dress like a pirate to do it

04:02.820 --> 04:04.820
And let's not forget the Jews

04:04.820 --> 04:07.820
Lord have mercy, let's not forget the Jews

04:07.820 --> 04:08.820
Get it together, guys!

04:08.820 --> 04:11.820
I mean, even Mundane Matt thinks you should do it

04:11.820 --> 04:13.820
And he's a genius, wait

04:13.820 --> 04:15.820
Is that his logo?

04:15.820 --> 04:16.820
Is...

04:16.820 --> 04:19.820
What is it with these people and skulls?

04:20.820 --> 04:22.820
Are we the baddies?

04:22.820 --> 04:24.820
I have not made these white ashtrays

04:24.820 --> 04:30.820
Don't worry though, I'm sure at some point in the near future they'll realize how shitty and needlessly argumentative this makes them and their project look

04:30.820 --> 04:33.820
And they'll pretend to be friends again to try and save face

04:33.820 --> 04:34.820
No way, that already happened!

04:34.820 --> 04:37.820
Owen Arrini Productions is back in business

04:39.820 --> 04:43.820
Oh my god, Sony Vegas editing, it's so amazing

04:43.820 --> 04:45.820
Reunite!

04:45.820 --> 04:46.820
Oh, it's gone

04:46.820 --> 04:48.820
It's okay, we're all friends again, honest

04:48.820 --> 04:53.820
Can you please all un-lose all respect you ever had for this project, please?

04:53.820 --> 04:55.820
Thank you very much

04:55.820 --> 04:57.820
We're in good company with this

04:57.820 --> 04:59.820
Look up the production of the...

04:59.820 --> 05:01.820
I believe the first Godfather movie

05:01.820 --> 05:02.820
So we're not alone

05:10.820 --> 05:13.820
I think I'm having a heart attack, seriously

05:13.820 --> 05:15.820
My heart hurts

05:15.820 --> 05:17.820
I can't take this

05:18.820 --> 05:22.820
He's comparing himself to Francis Ford fucking Coppola

05:23.820 --> 05:26.820
The apocalypse is now for me

05:26.820 --> 05:28.820
My heart is killing me

05:28.820 --> 05:30.820
Oh Jesus Christ

05:30.820 --> 05:32.820
Hey Jordan, remember that time I said

05:32.820 --> 05:35.820
I hope Owen realizes that he's hitting rock bottom

05:35.820 --> 05:37.820
That he can't continue to go on like this

05:37.820 --> 05:40.820
And that he makes amends and starts working on becoming a kinder

05:40.820 --> 05:43.820
More considerate and more responsible person

05:43.820 --> 05:45.820
Well I was just kidding, everything's fine

05:45.820 --> 05:49.820
Remember those times I directly compared you to Elliot fucking Roger?

05:49.820 --> 05:52.820
Go watch Jordan's video on Roach

05:52.820 --> 05:54.820
It's an hour long and it's very tedious

05:54.820 --> 05:58.820
But you'll see these occasional glimpses of Elliot Roger

05:58.820 --> 06:02.820
He wound up going completely Elliot Rogers as I was driving him to the airport

06:02.820 --> 06:05.820
Well that was also just kidding

06:05.820 --> 06:07.820
This project is fine

06:07.820 --> 06:08.820
Well that's just great

06:08.820 --> 06:10.820
Good to see the project's back on track

06:10.820 --> 06:12.820
The train track to

06:12.820 --> 06:15.820
Successfully defeating basic critical theory

06:15.820 --> 06:17.820
Cheers guys

06:21.820 --> 06:23.820
Seriously that's how much he drinks at a time

06:23.820 --> 06:25.820
Go and check his videos

06:25.820 --> 06:27.820
Fucking seriously

06:33.820 --> 06:35.820
You know I'm not going to look at myself

06:35.820 --> 06:37.820
I'm not going to improve myself

06:37.820 --> 06:39.820
I'm not going to try and benefit my community

06:39.820 --> 06:42.820
Or grow something good and positive

06:42.820 --> 06:43.820
No

06:43.820 --> 06:47.820
I'm going to blame others for my failings

06:47.820 --> 06:49.820
And then

06:49.820 --> 06:51.820
And then I'm going to go hurt those others

06:51.820 --> 06:53.820
And say they deserved it

06:53.820 --> 06:56.820
Because I'm a failure, they deserve to hurt

06:59.820 --> 07:03.820
Jordan Owen and David Serrini have worked closely together for months

07:03.820 --> 07:06.820
And even they can't decide if they like each other or not

07:06.820 --> 07:09.820
Why should we trust what they have to say about a woman who

07:09.820 --> 07:10.820
They haven't even met

07:10.820 --> 07:13.820
Who at most has made a couple of hours of video footage

07:13.820 --> 07:16.820
And whose name they can't even fucking spell

07:16.820 --> 07:18.820
Guys

07:18.820 --> 07:20.820
Guys

07:20.820 --> 07:22.820
You look like twats

07:22.820 --> 07:24.820
It's all Whitey's fault

07:24.820 --> 07:25.820
It's all slavery

07:25.820 --> 07:28.820
Slavery even though it ended 150 years ago

07:28.820 --> 07:30.820
Is still holding my people down

07:30.820 --> 07:33.820
Overall I'm just glad to see this little lover's tiff is over

07:33.820 --> 07:36.820
I mean, seriously, what restraint

07:36.820 --> 07:38.820
On the part of Jordan Owen to

07:38.820 --> 07:41.820
Still be friends with someone and work with them on a documentary

07:41.820 --> 07:44.820
After they directly compare you to Elliot Rodger

07:44.820 --> 07:47.820
And make fun of you to the whole world and leak skype logs

07:47.820 --> 07:51.820
And say you have horrible, horrible brain problems

07:51.820 --> 07:53.820
And gaslight you

07:53.820 --> 07:54.820
I mean

07:54.820 --> 07:56.820
Comparing someone to Elliot Rodger is

07:56.820 --> 07:58.820
The sort of shitty thing that I would do

07:58.820 --> 08:00.820
In fact I did do it

08:00.820 --> 08:02.820
Does that mean we'll be friends next?

08:05.820 --> 08:07.820
I gotta get out of here

08:31.820 --> 08:33.820
I'm going in first gear

08:33.820 --> 08:34.820
I'm going really fucking slow

08:34.820 --> 08:36.820
This isn't actually very good at all

08:36.820 --> 08:37.820
Seriously

08:37.820 --> 08:39.820
I'm not even listening to music

08:39.820 --> 08:40.820
I'm gonna dub it in post

08:40.820 --> 08:42.820
But it'll sound like I'm listening to music

08:42.820 --> 08:44.820
And you'll think I'm cool, right?

08:46.820 --> 08:48.820
I gotta get out of here

08:51.820 --> 08:52.820
Fuck
