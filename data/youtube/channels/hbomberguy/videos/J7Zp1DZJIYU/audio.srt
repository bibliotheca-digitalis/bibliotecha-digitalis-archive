00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,680
The Witness has done pretty well for an expensive indie game where you draw lines on squares.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,200
What are you doing looking so sad with your arms like that?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,760
Oh, he's a juggler!

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,400
Let's put a smile on that face!

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,720
The game has a lot of depth to both the puzzles, the design of the world,

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
with all of its intricate little visual tricks.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,440
Oh, look, it's some eyes!

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,920
And unraveling the overarching mystery of what it's all about.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,040
Oh, look, I'm an angel!

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,160
Just kidding, I'm the...

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,280
Hold on, hold on.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,960
Wait, come on.

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,480
Wait.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,360
No.

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,520
I'm the king!

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,600
Whether you enjoy the puzzles or the more unique components of the storytelling in Jonathan Blow's latest,

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,200
I think it's worthwhile to take the time to look back at his previous hit from 2008,

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,800
Braid.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,840
In my videos, I like to offer alternative perspectives on things and contribute to people's processes,

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,640
so I thought I'd make a video detailing the six things I personally think make Braid truly special.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,720
Why six?

24
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,280
Well, because there's six worlds in Braid.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,760
That's actually a coincidence. I just don't want to do five.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,040
What a terrible number.

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,560
It's liney, it's curvy.

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,720
Make up your mind, Phi Number One!

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,160
Visual craftsmanship!

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,320
All the game's visuals have been polished to a mirror shine.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,280
The animated painting cloud background of the level selects are mesmerizing,

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,480
and Tim himself is an animated painting.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,280
It must have taken ages to get each frame looking right with all the shading on his hair and stuff.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,760
Also, despite being rendered in a somewhat painterly style,

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Tim still looks cartoonish when it works.

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,080
His death animation has a couple of frames of just...

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,320
Wow.

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm dead now.

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,600
That sucks.

40
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,840
I wasn't expecting this.

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,320
You see this checklist of enemies to kill?

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,240
Each one is a unique drawing...

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,040
Drawing?

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,560
Uh...

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,720
Draw-ing?

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
Draw- how do you...

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,680
Each one is a unique picture, and each X as you kill them is unique, too.

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
It adds a sense of personalization to the level,

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,800
along with finding work for the artist to do.

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,680
It's a pity they were paid in exposure.

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,040
Number two!

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,000
Owl Swoom Immigary!

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,440
This sounds a lot like the previous one, but there's a big difference between simply looking cool...

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,520
It's as boring as I expected.

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,520
...and using your visuals to enhance the story's meaning.

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Braid does both, so it gets two different points.

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
Look at these little guys.

58
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,160
Don't they remind you of something?

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Hmm, what about this guy?

60
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
And the design of this area?

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,440
Juuump...

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,040
Pfft...

63
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
Maaan?

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,240
The princess is in another castle.

65
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
What does that remind me of?

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,960
And you collect stars, too?

67
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,440
This is Mario!

68
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
The game's Mario-ing you!

69
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
But why?

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
Far more than for a cheap reference,

71
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,080
the game presents itself as an alternative version of a Mario game.

72
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,320
Miyamoto's fairly open about how saving a princess is really just a quick excuse for the gameplay to happen.

73
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,720
That's why it's the same premise as Zelda.

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
The actual story in early games was treated as genuinely unimportant.

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
Braid offers a different version of events,

76
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,720
where instead of a literal journey to save an actual princess,

77
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,800
Mario's on a deeper, almost spiritual quest for meaning,

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
where meaning might even be unattainable.

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,360
You know, if you watch Mario backwards, Mario's actually the bad guy,

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,400
leaving the princess in Bowser's clutches before walking out backwards for some reason,

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
and resurrecting bad guys on his way back home.

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,520
Wow. Rude.

83
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,040
On top of this, the enemies are all designed to look just a little bit like Tim.

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Given that the game can be a metaphor for Tim getting over himself,

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,320
or doing battle with his own psyche,

86
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,200
it's nice that the enemies have a Tim-ness to them.

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
Alongside this, the bad guy-slash-good guy,

88
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,240
depending on your point of view, oh, it's so deep,

89
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,600
we see at the end,

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,040
doesn't he look a little Tim-like himself?

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,320
Similar hairstyle, but amped up to be cartoonishly over-the-top,

92
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,560
and with this sort of hyper-masculine look to him, but still.

93
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Also, here's a cool thing.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,320
At this point, almost everyone knows the twist where,

95
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,920
when you finish the game and hit reverse,

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,320
you realize the princess was running away from you and not the guy.

97
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,880
Well, in the backwards version, his face is actually different.

98
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,520
He's less angry-looking.

99
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,640
Using visual changes, the game is making a subtle point that,

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,760
not only do events look different backwards,

101
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,440
but there's a little bit of unreliable narratorship going on.

102
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,280
And when we see what's really happening, he's far less creepy.

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,160
He also doesn't give off a cartoonishly evil roar.

104
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,760
Visual and or-de-al signifiers like this help to create the sense

105
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,800
that Tim literally sees people he doesn't like as cartoonish bad guys.

106
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,800
Your ex's old boyfriends always seem like total assholes.

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Why can't Tim's?

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Oh, Kevin, just you wait until I invent the atomic bomb,

109
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
then I'll wipe the smile off your fa-

110
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
No, wait! He's me!

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
I'm battling my own repressed failures!

112
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,080
NOOO-

113
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,960
Number three.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,880
When you die in a video game, it restarts.

115
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
It's treated as a, that didn't happen moment.

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
Mario didn't actually die just there.

117
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Let's try again.

118
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,600
Death isn't final because it gets overridden.

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,240
In Braid, when you die, everything stops.

120
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,560
You just hang here on the precipice.

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
You have to literally go back

122
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,520
and prevent the death for him to continue.

123
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
It takes a logical leap from previous games.

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,680
You're actually making sure what happened didn't happen.

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,080
You're unhappening it.

126
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,480
But the game's approach to death doesn't end there.

127
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,360
Death is an intrinsic part of the world of Braid.

128
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,760
Loads of puzzles rely on Tim causing the deaths

129
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,800
of other creatures in ways that benefit him,

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,280
giving him extra lift for a jump

131
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
or making it carry a key to him

132
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,680
or using the bodies of cute little bunnies

133
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,960
with flowers on them to block cannon fire.

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh my God!

135
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Oh my God!

136
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
This room, which is my favorite room

137
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,160
in the whole game, by the way,

138
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,440
hammers this point home perfectly.

139
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,880
Because in order to go through that door,

140
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,920
you have to walk just far enough

141
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,120
that this poor little guy has to die.

142
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,960
You have no choice.

143
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,080
And given that he looks like you,

144
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,600
it's kind of like this weird suicide thing?

145
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
I don't know.

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
Tim even has to kill himself over and over to progress.

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,640
His quest is built on the corpses of many,

148
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,480
even his own, but especially bunnies.

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,600
No. 4

150
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,400
Nummer vier.

151
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
Très bien.

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,520
I can't do German or French,

153
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,280
and I tried to do both.

154
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,720
Uh, number four, true depth.

155
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
I see a lot of theories on the net

156
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
that rely on the princess as a metaphor

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
for the atomic bomb.

158
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,120
These people are wrong and will pay for their crimes.

159
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
There's only two clear references

160
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,840
to the atomic bomb in the game,

161
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,880
when I think what makes the game interesting

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,040
is the story's purposeful vagueness.

163
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,520
There's Tim, and there's the Princess,

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
with a capital, The.

165
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,240
The journey can represent a lot of different things.

166
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,080
The idea that there's one true meaning

167
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,600
is inherently flawed,

168
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
and the story becomes more about

169
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,120
a general human quest for meaning.

170
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,560
When people found the second ending,

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,200
Jonathan Blow insisted the game

172
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
still had more in it to find.

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
This pissed off a lot of people

174
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,560
who had combed the game's files

175
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,800
and conclusively found that there weren't.

176
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,680
But Blow was right.

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
There is more to find,

178
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
and it's this thing called personal meaning.

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Anyone can Google,

180
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
what does the Princess represent,

181
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,840
or the authors of the quotes

182
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
that pepper the world's storybooks,

183
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,560
but what makes Braid truly fascinating,

184
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,840
at least in relative video game storytelling terms,

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,040
is that you don't need any of that.

186
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,600
You can think about its relevance to you individually.

187
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
You can fill in the blanks of Tim's life

188
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,160
and decisions and thoughts in your own particular way,

189
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
and that's awesome.

190
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
Number five.

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Some parts aren't fun on purpose, and this is fine.

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
The game, if anything, is improved

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
by the parts of it that are annoying.

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,120
For example, there's a star you can only get

195
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,040
by sitting and waiting two hours

196
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,920
while a cloud moves across the screen.

197
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
The game's hardest challenge is literally designed

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
to be boring and unfun,

199
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
to teach you something about how silly it is

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
to seek 100% completion

201
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
simply for the sake of having done everything.

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I like Jonathan Blow,

203
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
and not just because I have the unstoppable urge

204
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,680
to seek out people equally as pretentious

205
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
and egotistical as me,

206
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
but because he's not under any illusions

207
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
about the game's failures.

208
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,840
Even though the game purposefully has parts

209
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
that aren't entertaining,

210
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,240
Jonathan Blow doesn't use this as an excuse

211
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,400
for bad game design.

212
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,360
He's completely open about aspects of the game

213
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,480
he feels he did wrong.

214
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
And this cannon ends up killing people

215
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
for no interesting reason.

216
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,720
It's like, oh, I didn't go through with the right timing,

217
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
and now I just have to try again and again,

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
and some people, like, try 10 times to get through there.

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,720
It's not cool.

220
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,280
That's not what the game's about.

221
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,760
This willingness to criticize his own design work,

222
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,320
even while defending parts of the game

223
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,760
that purposefully aren't fun,

224
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,880
reveals the viability for games as a medium

225
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,720
to be more than skinner boxes

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
that give out good feelings when you do the right thing.

227
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,360
This is just my opinion,

228
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,040
but I think there's an artistic merit

229
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
to annoying someone,

230
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
or punishing them for acting without thinking,

231
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,680
or making them wait for something they don't really need.

232
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,160
This level doesn't even have a name

233
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
because the feeling you get

234
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,680
watching your own self die to help you

235
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,840
can't be described in words.

236
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
In being willing to explore these alternative emotions

237
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,280
beyond simple satisfaction with having solved a puzzle,

238
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,640
the game doesn't just do something different.

239
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
It also makes a case for the power games

240
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,680
can have as a medium to even do this sort of thing.

241
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,920
That's pretty radical when you think about it.

242
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,680
Except Blow is wrong about the cannon.

243
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
He knows why you put it there.

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,800
It's because he's a monster.

245
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,680
["What a monster!" sound effect plays.]

246
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,200
And finally, number six.

247
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,720
Uhhhh, it's secretly a book!

248
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
While lots of games have audio logs

249
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,700
and journal entries that push the...

250
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,480
While lots of games have audio logs

251
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
and journal entries that push the plot forward

252
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,880
in a basic way,

253
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,720
few games encourage you to actually sit

254
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
and think about something,

255
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,880
or read what amounts to a story

256
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
about a visit to your parents' house,

257
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
quite like Braid does.

258
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,600
The text portions are completely optional,

259
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,520
but offer another layer of meaning

260
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,400
to each world's gimmicks.

261
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,760
It's quite well-written prose, too.

262
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,720
Plenty of games have good writing

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
in the sense that characters say something funny

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,440
or the story is explained...

265
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
Ugh.

266
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,600
Effectively.

267
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
But I really can't think of another game

268
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,320
that has writing in this specific sense,

269
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,520
the sense where you can actually stop

270
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,240
and contemplate its meaning,

271
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,640
like with a good book.

272
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,720
And I'm a fan of books myself.

273
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
I'm a bookie.

274
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,360
I'll see you all at BookCon 2016.

275
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,800
I was gonna do the dramatic thing

276
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840
where I throw the books in the air

277
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
and they collapse down,

278
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,000
but that is not how you treat books.

279
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
That is not right.

280
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,480
Speaking of time travel,

281
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,800
if I had the power to go back in time,

282
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,480
I would use it to unread this.

283
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,680
It's like a fucking early access beta

284
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
of To Kill a Mockingbird.

285
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
Also, I'd probably go back even further

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
and become the head of Puffin,

287
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,000
whoever publishes this garbage,

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
and I would hire a better graphic designer,

289
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
because you don't put the name of the previous book

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
in the same size next to the text there,

291
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,320
so it says,

292
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,720
"'Ghostletter to Kill a Watchman, Mockingbird?'

293
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
That doesn't make any sense.

294
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
Get your ass in gear, Harper."

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
Jonathan Blow's next game, The Witness,

296
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,760
has audio logs as well,

297
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,400
but uses them to tell a story

298
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
in a kind of sideways way that's kind of cool.

299
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,640
All the logs are quotes from various places

300
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
that don't really have a direct relevance to the game

301
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,240
in a way that I think forces you to go,

302
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
what?

303
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,120
And figure out what's actually going on for yourself

304
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,160
without just, you know, piecing together,

305
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,920
oh, this one says demons come through a hole,

306
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,160
so now I know the story.

307
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, great.

308
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,160
Instead, imagine if you played a version of Doom 3

309
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,920
where the diary entries were like a fucking

310
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,880
two-minute quote from a philosopher,

311
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,720
and you're like,

312
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,200
what the fuck, John Carmack?

313
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,280
Well, guess what?

314
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,080
It would be a better game.

315
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,800
The Witness also builds on these ideas

316
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,840
by having a literal projection booth

317
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,360
where you can sit and watch extracts

318
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,080
from real documentaries.

319
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
It's not the same as the books exactly,

320
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
but it has a similar feel.

321
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,840
You can watch James Burke talk about how art is worthless

322
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,480
and have a good long think about the differing purposes

323
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,720
of art and science.

324
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,800
I think that's neat.

325
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh, spoilers, that happens in The Witness.

326
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Sorry.

327
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,560
That should honestly be a new way that we rate games.

328
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,560
You know, story, graphics, sound, gameplay.

329
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,280
Can you listen to James Burke tell you that art is shit?

330
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,040
You may find Blow himself pretentious

331
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,560
or dumb or overreaching,

332
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,000
but he made a fine game

333
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,040
and encouraged people to think more about games

334
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,760
and stories and even life.

335
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,560
Even if, in your opinion, he's not the best at it,

336
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
I think even attempting to think about these things

337
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,520
has value.

338
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,640
This week, I'd also like to spay an, spay, ah.

339
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,800
This week, I'd also like to pay an extra special thanks

340
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,000
to Amanda Beverley, Alexander Corbett,

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,080
Ciaran Dachtler, Rob Brunt, Jenny Angel,

342
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,760
and Kevin Knipe.

343
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,720
Kneep.

344
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,640
Tell me how to pronounce that

345
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
and I'll do it better next time.

346
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm sorry.

347
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,400
Thanks very much for watching.

348
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,520
Hope you liked it.

349
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
This is kind of a new thing for me,

350
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,120
so please give me any constructive criticism you can,

351
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,960
unless it's negative feedback,

352
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,600
in which case, write it on a physical piece of paper

353
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,320
and throw it in the bin.

354
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,160
If you like this video,

355
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
please consider giving me money on Patreon.

356
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,440
For $2 or more, you can get access

357
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
to a bunch of the bonus stuff

358
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
that I either cut out of videos

359
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
because it's like an outtake

360
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,400
or just doesn't fit anymore.

361
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,640
And just also stuff that can't go in

362
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
because it's me playing through a game

363
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,840
and talking over it for the sake of the footage

364
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,280
for this video and stuff.

365
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,120
If for my next video,

366
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,640
you want me to talk about the philosophy of Dark Souls 2,

367
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,320
and yes, specifically Dark Souls 2,

368
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,280
click this sphinx on this side of the screen.

369
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,960
But if instead you prefer me to talk about

370
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,600
why Fallout 3 is garbage,

371
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,480
please click on this orc-ized version

372
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,440
of the originally interesting and cool

373
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Super Mutant characters from the original games.

374
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,960
Say goodbye, Cody.

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
Wave, wave at him.

376
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,440
He doesn't speak English.
