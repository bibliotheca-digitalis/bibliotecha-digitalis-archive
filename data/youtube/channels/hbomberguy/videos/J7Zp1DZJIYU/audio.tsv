3600	8680	The Witness has done pretty well for an expensive indie game where you draw lines on squares.
8680	11200	What are you doing looking so sad with your arms like that?
11200	12760	Oh, he's a juggler!
12760	15400	Let's put a smile on that face!
15400	18720	The game has a lot of depth to both the puzzles, the design of the world,
18720	20960	with all of its intricate little visual tricks.
20960	22440	Oh, look, it's some eyes!
22440	25920	And unraveling the overarching mystery of what it's all about.
25920	28040	Oh, look, I'm an angel!
28040	29160	Just kidding, I'm the...
29200	30280	Hold on, hold on.
30280	30960	Wait, come on.
30960	31480	Wait.
31480	32360	No.
32360	33520	I'm the king!
33520	38600	Whether you enjoy the puzzles or the more unique components of the storytelling in Jonathan Blow's latest,
38600	43200	I think it's worthwhile to take the time to look back at his previous hit from 2008,
43200	43800	Braid.
47960	52840	In my videos, I like to offer alternative perspectives on things and contribute to people's processes,
52840	57640	so I thought I'd make a video detailing the six things I personally think make Braid truly special.
57640	58720	Why six?
58760	61280	Well, because there's six worlds in Braid.
61800	64760	That's actually a coincidence. I just don't want to do five.
64760	66040	What a terrible number.
66040	67560	It's liney, it's curvy.
67560	70720	Make up your mind, Phi Number One!
70720	73160	Visual craftsmanship!
73160	76320	All the game's visuals have been polished to a mirror shine.
76320	80280	The animated painting cloud background of the level selects are mesmerizing,
80280	82480	and Tim himself is an animated painting.
82480	86280	It must have taken ages to get each frame looking right with all the shading on his hair and stuff.
86280	89760	Also, despite being rendered in a somewhat painterly style,
89760	91760	Tim still looks cartoonish when it works.
91760	94080	His death animation has a couple of frames of just...
94680	95320	Wow.
95880	96800	I'm dead now.
97560	98600	That sucks.
99120	100840	I wasn't expecting this.
101160	103320	You see this checklist of enemies to kill?
103320	105240	Each one is a unique drawing...
106440	107040	Drawing?
107040	107560	Uh...
107560	108720	Draw-ing?
108720	110040	Draw- how do you...
110040	113680	Each one is a unique picture, and each X as you kill them is unique, too.
113680	116640	It adds a sense of personalization to the level,
116640	118800	along with finding work for the artist to do.
118800	120680	It's a pity they were paid in exposure.
121800	123040	Number two!
123040	125000	Owl Swoom Immigary!
125000	129440	This sounds a lot like the previous one, but there's a big difference between simply looking cool...
130640	132520	It's as boring as I expected.
132520	135520	...and using your visuals to enhance the story's meaning.
135520	138480	Braid does both, so it gets two different points.
138800	140440	Look at these little guys.
140440	142160	Don't they remind you of something?
142680	144320	Hmm, what about this guy?
144320	145920	And the design of this area?
146320	147440	Juuump...
147440	148040	Pfft...
148040	149440	Maaan?
149440	151240	The princess is in another castle.
151240	152680	What does that remind me of?
152680	154960	And you collect stars, too?
154960	156440	This is Mario!
156440	158040	The game's Mario-ing you!
158040	159040	But why?
159360	161400	Far more than for a cheap reference,
161400	165080	the game presents itself as an alternative version of a Mario game.
165080	170320	Miyamoto's fairly open about how saving a princess is really just a quick excuse for the gameplay to happen.
170360	172720	That's why it's the same premise as Zelda.
172720	176800	The actual story in early games was treated as genuinely unimportant.
176800	178520	Braid offers a different version of events,
178520	181720	where instead of a literal journey to save an actual princess,
181720	184800	Mario's on a deeper, almost spiritual quest for meaning,
184800	187200	where meaning might even be unattainable.
187200	190360	You know, if you watch Mario backwards, Mario's actually the bad guy,
190360	194400	leaving the princess in Bowser's clutches before walking out backwards for some reason,
194400	197040	and resurrecting bad guys on his way back home.
197040	198520	Wow. Rude.
198520	203040	On top of this, the enemies are all designed to look just a little bit like Tim.
203040	206480	Given that the game can be a metaphor for Tim getting over himself,
206480	208320	or doing battle with his own psyche,
208320	211200	it's nice that the enemies have a Tim-ness to them.
211200	213920	Alongside this, the bad guy-slash-good guy,
213920	216240	depending on your point of view, oh, it's so deep,
216240	217600	we see at the end,
217600	221040	doesn't he look a little Tim-like himself?
221040	224320	Similar hairstyle, but amped up to be cartoonishly over-the-top,
224320	227560	and with this sort of hyper-masculine look to him, but still.
227600	229000	Also, here's a cool thing.
229000	231320	At this point, almost everyone knows the twist where,
231320	232920	when you finish the game and hit reverse,
232920	236320	you realize the princess was running away from you and not the guy.
236320	239880	Well, in the backwards version, his face is actually different.
239880	241520	He's less angry-looking.
241520	244640	Using visual changes, the game is making a subtle point that,
244640	246760	not only do events look different backwards,
246760	250440	but there's a little bit of unreliable narratorship going on.
250440	254280	And when we see what's really happening, he's far less creepy.
254280	257160	He also doesn't give off a cartoonishly evil roar.
257200	261760	Visual and or-de-al signifiers like this help to create the sense
261760	265800	that Tim literally sees people he doesn't like as cartoonish bad guys.
266480	268800	Your ex's old boyfriends always seem like total assholes.
268800	269720	Why can't Tim's?
270480	273560	Oh, Kevin, just you wait until I invent the atomic bomb,
273560	275120	then I'll wipe the smile off your fa-
275120	277360	No, wait! He's me!
277360	279280	I'm battling my own repressed failures!
279280	281080	NOOO-
281080	281960	Number three.
284400	286880	When you die in a video game, it restarts.
286880	289360	It's treated as a, that didn't happen moment.
289360	291440	Mario didn't actually die just there.
291440	292840	Let's try again.
292840	295600	Death isn't final because it gets overridden.
295600	299240	In Braid, when you die, everything stops.
300480	303560	You just hang here on the precipice.
303560	305160	You have to literally go back
305160	307520	and prevent the death for him to continue.
307520	309600	It takes a logical leap from previous games.
309600	312680	You're actually making sure what happened didn't happen.
312680	315080	You're unhappening it.
315080	317480	But the game's approach to death doesn't end there.
317480	320360	Death is an intrinsic part of the world of Braid.
320360	322760	Loads of puzzles rely on Tim causing the deaths
322760	324800	of other creatures in ways that benefit him,
324800	326280	giving him extra lift for a jump
326280	327720	or making it carry a key to him
327720	329680	or using the bodies of cute little bunnies
329680	331960	with flowers on them to block cannon fire.
332880	334400	Oh my God!
334400	335240	Oh my God!
336440	338040	This room, which is my favorite room
338040	339160	in the whole game, by the way,
339160	341440	hammers this point home perfectly.
341440	343880	Because in order to go through that door,
343880	345920	you have to walk just far enough
345920	348120	that this poor little guy has to die.
348120	349960	You have no choice.
349960	351080	And given that he looks like you,
351080	352600	it's kind of like this weird suicide thing?
352600	353440	I don't know.
353440	356800	Tim even has to kill himself over and over to progress.
356800	359640	His quest is built on the corpses of many,
359640	362480	even his own, but especially bunnies.
362720	364600	No. 4
365760	367400	Nummer vier.
367400	369280	Très bien.
369280	370520	I can't do German or French,
370520	372280	and I tried to do both.
372280	374720	Uh, number four, true depth.
374720	376120	I see a lot of theories on the net
376120	377720	that rely on the princess as a metaphor
377720	379160	for the atomic bomb.
379160	382120	These people are wrong and will pay for their crimes.
382120	383680	There's only two clear references
383680	384840	to the atomic bomb in the game,
384840	386880	when I think what makes the game interesting
386880	389040	is the story's purposeful vagueness.
389040	391520	There's Tim, and there's the Princess,
391600	392760	with a capital, The.
392760	395240	The journey can represent a lot of different things.
395240	397080	The idea that there's one true meaning
397080	398600	is inherently flawed,
398600	399920	and the story becomes more about
399920	402120	a general human quest for meaning.
402120	403560	When people found the second ending,
403560	405200	Jonathan Blow insisted the game
405200	407000	still had more in it to find.
407000	408200	This pissed off a lot of people
408200	409560	who had combed the game's files
409560	411800	and conclusively found that there weren't.
411800	413680	But Blow was right.
413680	415360	There is more to find,
415360	417680	and it's this thing called personal meaning.
417680	418720	Anyone can Google,
418840	420520	what does the Princess represent,
420520	421840	or the authors of the quotes
421840	423240	that pepper the world's storybooks,
423240	425560	but what makes Braid truly fascinating,
425560	427840	at least in relative video game storytelling terms,
427840	430040	is that you don't need any of that.
430040	432600	You can think about its relevance to you individually.
432600	434440	You can fill in the blanks of Tim's life
434440	437160	and decisions and thoughts in your own particular way,
437160	438400	and that's awesome.
438400	439440	Number five.
439440	441120	Some parts aren't fun on purpose, and this is fine.
441120	442720	The game, if anything, is improved
442720	444240	by the parts of it that are annoying.
444240	446120	For example, there's a star you can only get
446120	448040	by sitting and waiting two hours
448040	449920	while a cloud moves across the screen.
449920	451840	The game's hardest challenge is literally designed
451840	453560	to be boring and unfun,
453560	455360	to teach you something about how silly it is
455360	456800	to seek 100% completion
456800	458800	simply for the sake of having done everything.
458800	459800	I like Jonathan Blow,
459800	461800	and not just because I have the unstoppable urge
461800	463680	to seek out people equally as pretentious
463680	465080	and egotistical as me,
465080	466600	but because he's not under any illusions
466600	467800	about the game's failures.
467800	469840	Even though the game purposefully has parts
469840	471040	that aren't entertaining,
471040	473240	Jonathan Blow doesn't use this as an excuse
473240	474400	for bad game design.
474400	476360	He's completely open about aspects of the game
476360	477480	he feels he did wrong.
477680	479080	And this cannon ends up killing people
479080	480120	for no interesting reason.
480120	482720	It's like, oh, I didn't go through with the right timing,
482720	484240	and now I just have to try again and again,
484240	486800	and some people, like, try 10 times to get through there.
486800	487720	It's not cool.
487720	489280	That's not what the game's about.
489280	491760	This willingness to criticize his own design work,
491760	493320	even while defending parts of the game
493320	494760	that purposefully aren't fun,
494760	496880	reveals the viability for games as a medium
496880	498720	to be more than skinner boxes
498720	501280	that give out good feelings when you do the right thing.
501280	502360	This is just my opinion,
502360	504040	but I think there's an artistic merit
504040	505200	to annoying someone,
505200	507600	or punishing them for acting without thinking,
507600	510680	or making them wait for something they don't really need.
510680	512160	This level doesn't even have a name
512160	513360	because the feeling you get
513360	515680	watching your own self die to help you
515680	517840	can't be described in words.
517840	520400	In being willing to explore these alternative emotions
520400	523280	beyond simple satisfaction with having solved a puzzle,
523280	525640	the game doesn't just do something different.
525640	527640	It also makes a case for the power games
527640	530680	can have as a medium to even do this sort of thing.
530680	532920	That's pretty radical when you think about it.
532920	534680	Except Blow is wrong about the cannon.
534680	536080	He knows why you put it there.
536080	537800	It's because he's a monster.
537800	539680	["What a monster!" sound effect plays.]
539680	542200	And finally, number six.
542200	544720	Uhhhh, it's secretly a book!
544720	546480	While lots of games have audio logs
546480	548700	and journal entries that push the...
548700	550480	While lots of games have audio logs
550480	552640	and journal entries that push the plot forward
552640	553880	in a basic way,
553880	555720	few games encourage you to actually sit
555720	556960	and think about something,
556960	558880	or read what amounts to a story
558880	560720	about a visit to your parents' house,
560720	562320	quite like Braid does.
562320	564600	The text portions are completely optional,
564600	566520	but offer another layer of meaning
566520	568400	to each world's gimmicks.
568400	570760	It's quite well-written prose, too.
570760	572720	Plenty of games have good writing
572720	574720	in the sense that characters say something funny
574720	576440	or the story is explained...
576440	577280	Ugh.
577280	578600	Effectively.
578600	580600	But I really can't think of another game
580600	583320	that has writing in this specific sense,
583320	584520	the sense where you can actually stop
584520	586240	and contemplate its meaning,
586240	587640	like with a good book.
587640	589720	And I'm a fan of books myself.
589720	591200	I'm a bookie.
591200	594360	I'll see you all at BookCon 2016.
595720	596800	I was gonna do the dramatic thing
596800	597840	where I throw the books in the air
597840	598680	and they collapse down,
598680	601000	but that is not how you treat books.
601000	602200	That is not right.
602200	603480	Speaking of time travel,
603480	604800	if I had the power to go back in time,
604800	607480	I would use it to unread this.
607480	609680	It's like a fucking early access beta
609680	611200	of To Kill a Mockingbird.
611200	613120	Also, I'd probably go back even further
613120	614360	and become the head of Puffin,
614360	616000	whoever publishes this garbage,
616000	618640	and I would hire a better graphic designer,
618640	620720	because you don't put the name of the previous book
620720	623280	in the same size next to the text there,
623280	624320	so it says,
624320	626720	"'Ghostletter to Kill a Watchman, Mockingbird?'
626720	628320	That doesn't make any sense.
628320	630000	Get your ass in gear, Harper."
630000	631920	Jonathan Blow's next game, The Witness,
631920	633760	has audio logs as well,
633760	635400	but uses them to tell a story
635400	637960	in a kind of sideways way that's kind of cool.
637960	640640	All the logs are quotes from various places
640640	643120	that don't really have a direct relevance to the game
643120	645240	in a way that I think forces you to go,
645240	646080	what?
646080	649120	And figure out what's actually going on for yourself
649120	651160	without just, you know, piecing together,
651160	654920	oh, this one says demons come through a hole,
654920	656160	so now I know the story.
656160	657000	Oh, great.
657000	660160	Instead, imagine if you played a version of Doom 3
660160	662920	where the diary entries were like a fucking
662920	664880	two-minute quote from a philosopher,
664880	665720	and you're like,
665720	668200	what the fuck, John Carmack?
668200	669280	Well, guess what?
669280	671080	It would be a better game.
671080	672800	The Witness also builds on these ideas
672800	674840	by having a literal projection booth
674840	676360	where you can sit and watch extracts
676360	678080	from real documentaries.
678080	679680	It's not the same as the books exactly,
679680	681160	but it has a similar feel.
681160	683840	You can watch James Burke talk about how art is worthless
683840	686480	and have a good long think about the differing purposes
686480	687720	of art and science.
687720	688800	I think that's neat.
688800	690480	Oh, spoilers, that happens in The Witness.
690480	691320	Sorry.
691320	693560	That should honestly be a new way that we rate games.
693560	698560	You know, story, graphics, sound, gameplay.
698600	702280	Can you listen to James Burke tell you that art is shit?
702280	704040	You may find Blow himself pretentious
704040	705560	or dumb or overreaching,
705560	707000	but he made a fine game
707000	709040	and encouraged people to think more about games
709040	710760	and stories and even life.
710760	713560	Even if, in your opinion, he's not the best at it,
713560	715680	I think even attempting to think about these things
715680	716520	has value.
728520	731640	This week, I'd also like to spay an, spay, ah.
731640	733800	This week, I'd also like to pay an extra special thanks
733800	737000	to Amanda Beverley, Alexander Corbett,
737000	741080	Ciaran Dachtler, Rob Brunt, Jenny Angel,
741080	742760	and Kevin Knipe.
742760	743720	Kneep.
743720	744640	Tell me how to pronounce that
744640	745640	and I'll do it better next time.
745640	746560	I'm sorry.
746560	747400	Thanks very much for watching.
747400	748520	Hope you liked it.
748520	750120	This is kind of a new thing for me,
750120	755120	so please give me any constructive criticism you can,
755320	757960	unless it's negative feedback,
757960	760600	in which case, write it on a physical piece of paper
760600	762320	and throw it in the bin.
762320	763160	If you like this video,
763480	765480	please consider giving me money on Patreon.
765480	767440	For $2 or more, you can get access
767440	769440	to a bunch of the bonus stuff
769440	770880	that I either cut out of videos
770880	772080	because it's like an outtake
772080	774400	or just doesn't fit anymore.
774400	776640	And just also stuff that can't go in
776640	777880	because it's me playing through a game
777880	779840	and talking over it for the sake of the footage
779840	781280	for this video and stuff.
781280	782120	If for my next video,
782120	784640	you want me to talk about the philosophy of Dark Souls 2,
784640	787320	and yes, specifically Dark Souls 2,
787320	791280	click this sphinx on this side of the screen.
791280	792960	But if instead you prefer me to talk about
793760	794600	why Fallout 3 is garbage,
794600	797480	please click on this orc-ized version
797480	799440	of the originally interesting and cool
799440	801920	Super Mutant characters from the original games.
801920	802960	Say goodbye, Cody.
804000	804960	Wave, wave at him.
808200	809440	He doesn't speak English.
