00:02.680 --> 00:03.600
♪

00:03.600 --> 00:08.680
The Witness has done pretty well for an expensive indie game where you draw lines on squares.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.200
What are you doing looking so sad with your arms like that?

00:11.200 --> 00:12.760
Oh, he's a juggler!

00:12.760 --> 00:15.400
Let's put a smile on that face!

00:15.400 --> 00:18.720
The game has a lot of depth to both the puzzles, the design of the world,

00:18.720 --> 00:20.960
with all of its intricate little visual tricks.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.440
Oh, look, it's some eyes!

00:22.440 --> 00:25.920
And unraveling the overarching mystery of what it's all about.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.040
Oh, look, I'm an angel!

00:28.040 --> 00:29.160
Just kidding, I'm the...

00:29.200 --> 00:30.280
Hold on, hold on.

00:30.280 --> 00:30.960
Wait, come on.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.480
Wait.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.360
No.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.520
I'm the king!

00:33.520 --> 00:38.600
Whether you enjoy the puzzles or the more unique components of the storytelling in Jonathan Blow's latest,

00:38.600 --> 00:43.200
I think it's worthwhile to take the time to look back at his previous hit from 2008,

00:43.200 --> 00:43.800
Braid.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.840
In my videos, I like to offer alternative perspectives on things and contribute to people's processes,

00:52.840 --> 00:57.640
so I thought I'd make a video detailing the six things I personally think make Braid truly special.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.720
Why six?

00:58.760 --> 01:01.280
Well, because there's six worlds in Braid.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.760
That's actually a coincidence. I just don't want to do five.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.040
What a terrible number.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.560
It's liney, it's curvy.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.720
Make up your mind, Phi Number One!

01:10.720 --> 01:13.160
Visual craftsmanship!

01:13.160 --> 01:16.320
All the game's visuals have been polished to a mirror shine.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.280
The animated painting cloud background of the level selects are mesmerizing,

01:20.280 --> 01:22.480
and Tim himself is an animated painting.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.280
It must have taken ages to get each frame looking right with all the shading on his hair and stuff.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.760
Also, despite being rendered in a somewhat painterly style,

01:29.760 --> 01:31.760
Tim still looks cartoonish when it works.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.080
His death animation has a couple of frames of just...

01:34.680 --> 01:35.320
Wow.

01:35.880 --> 01:36.800
I'm dead now.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.600
That sucks.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.840
I wasn't expecting this.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.320
You see this checklist of enemies to kill?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.240
Each one is a unique drawing...

01:46.440 --> 01:47.040
Drawing?

01:47.040 --> 01:47.560
Uh...

01:47.560 --> 01:48.720
Draw-ing?

01:48.720 --> 01:50.040
Draw- how do you...

01:50.040 --> 01:53.680
Each one is a unique picture, and each X as you kill them is unique, too.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.640
It adds a sense of personalization to the level,

01:56.640 --> 01:58.800
along with finding work for the artist to do.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.680
It's a pity they were paid in exposure.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.040
Number two!

02:03.040 --> 02:05.000
Owl Swoom Immigary!

02:05.000 --> 02:09.440
This sounds a lot like the previous one, but there's a big difference between simply looking cool...

02:10.640 --> 02:12.520
It's as boring as I expected.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.520
...and using your visuals to enhance the story's meaning.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.480
Braid does both, so it gets two different points.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.440
Look at these little guys.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.160
Don't they remind you of something?

02:22.680 --> 02:24.320
Hmm, what about this guy?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.920
And the design of this area?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.440
Juuump...

02:27.440 --> 02:28.040
Pfft...

02:28.040 --> 02:29.440
Maaan?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.240
The princess is in another castle.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.680
What does that remind me of?

02:32.680 --> 02:34.960
And you collect stars, too?

02:34.960 --> 02:36.440
This is Mario!

02:36.440 --> 02:38.040
The game's Mario-ing you!

02:38.040 --> 02:39.040
But why?

02:39.360 --> 02:41.400
Far more than for a cheap reference,

02:41.400 --> 02:45.080
the game presents itself as an alternative version of a Mario game.

02:45.080 --> 02:50.320
Miyamoto's fairly open about how saving a princess is really just a quick excuse for the gameplay to happen.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.720
That's why it's the same premise as Zelda.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.800
The actual story in early games was treated as genuinely unimportant.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.520
Braid offers a different version of events,

02:58.520 --> 03:01.720
where instead of a literal journey to save an actual princess,

03:01.720 --> 03:04.800
Mario's on a deeper, almost spiritual quest for meaning,

03:04.800 --> 03:07.200
where meaning might even be unattainable.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.360
You know, if you watch Mario backwards, Mario's actually the bad guy,

03:10.360 --> 03:14.400
leaving the princess in Bowser's clutches before walking out backwards for some reason,

03:14.400 --> 03:17.040
and resurrecting bad guys on his way back home.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.520
Wow. Rude.

03:18.520 --> 03:23.040
On top of this, the enemies are all designed to look just a little bit like Tim.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.480
Given that the game can be a metaphor for Tim getting over himself,

03:26.480 --> 03:28.320
or doing battle with his own psyche,

03:28.320 --> 03:31.200
it's nice that the enemies have a Tim-ness to them.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.920
Alongside this, the bad guy-slash-good guy,

03:33.920 --> 03:36.240
depending on your point of view, oh, it's so deep,

03:36.240 --> 03:37.600
we see at the end,

03:37.600 --> 03:41.040
doesn't he look a little Tim-like himself?

03:41.040 --> 03:44.320
Similar hairstyle, but amped up to be cartoonishly over-the-top,

03:44.320 --> 03:47.560
and with this sort of hyper-masculine look to him, but still.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.000
Also, here's a cool thing.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.320
At this point, almost everyone knows the twist where,

03:51.320 --> 03:52.920
when you finish the game and hit reverse,

03:52.920 --> 03:56.320
you realize the princess was running away from you and not the guy.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.880
Well, in the backwards version, his face is actually different.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.520
He's less angry-looking.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.640
Using visual changes, the game is making a subtle point that,

04:04.640 --> 04:06.760
not only do events look different backwards,

04:06.760 --> 04:10.440
but there's a little bit of unreliable narratorship going on.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.280
And when we see what's really happening, he's far less creepy.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.160
He also doesn't give off a cartoonishly evil roar.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.760
Visual and or-de-al signifiers like this help to create the sense

04:21.760 --> 04:25.800
that Tim literally sees people he doesn't like as cartoonish bad guys.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.800
Your ex's old boyfriends always seem like total assholes.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.720
Why can't Tim's?

04:30.480 --> 04:33.560
Oh, Kevin, just you wait until I invent the atomic bomb,

04:33.560 --> 04:35.120
then I'll wipe the smile off your fa-

04:35.120 --> 04:37.360
No, wait! He's me!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.280
I'm battling my own repressed failures!

04:39.280 --> 04:41.080
NOOO-

04:41.080 --> 04:41.960
Number three.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.880
When you die in a video game, it restarts.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.360
It's treated as a, that didn't happen moment.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.440
Mario didn't actually die just there.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.840
Let's try again.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.600
Death isn't final because it gets overridden.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.240
In Braid, when you die, everything stops.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.560
You just hang here on the precipice.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.160
You have to literally go back

05:05.160 --> 05:07.520
and prevent the death for him to continue.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.600
It takes a logical leap from previous games.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.680
You're actually making sure what happened didn't happen.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.080
You're unhappening it.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.480
But the game's approach to death doesn't end there.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.360
Death is an intrinsic part of the world of Braid.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.760
Loads of puzzles rely on Tim causing the deaths

05:22.760 --> 05:24.800
of other creatures in ways that benefit him,

05:24.800 --> 05:26.280
giving him extra lift for a jump

05:26.280 --> 05:27.720
or making it carry a key to him

05:27.720 --> 05:29.680
or using the bodies of cute little bunnies

05:29.680 --> 05:31.960
with flowers on them to block cannon fire.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.400
Oh my God!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.240
Oh my God!

05:36.440 --> 05:38.040
This room, which is my favorite room

05:38.040 --> 05:39.160
in the whole game, by the way,

05:39.160 --> 05:41.440
hammers this point home perfectly.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.880
Because in order to go through that door,

05:43.880 --> 05:45.920
you have to walk just far enough

05:45.920 --> 05:48.120
that this poor little guy has to die.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.960
You have no choice.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.080
And given that he looks like you,

05:51.080 --> 05:52.600
it's kind of like this weird suicide thing?

05:52.600 --> 05:53.440
I don't know.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.800
Tim even has to kill himself over and over to progress.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.640
His quest is built on the corpses of many,

05:59.640 --> 06:02.480
even his own, but especially bunnies.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.600
No. 4

06:05.760 --> 06:07.400
Nummer vier.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.280
Très bien.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.520
I can't do German or French,

06:10.520 --> 06:12.280
and I tried to do both.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.720
Uh, number four, true depth.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.120
I see a lot of theories on the net

06:16.120 --> 06:17.720
that rely on the princess as a metaphor

06:17.720 --> 06:19.160
for the atomic bomb.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.120
These people are wrong and will pay for their crimes.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.680
There's only two clear references

06:23.680 --> 06:24.840
to the atomic bomb in the game,

06:24.840 --> 06:26.880
when I think what makes the game interesting

06:26.880 --> 06:29.040
is the story's purposeful vagueness.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.520
There's Tim, and there's the Princess,

06:31.600 --> 06:32.760
with a capital, The.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.240
The journey can represent a lot of different things.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.080
The idea that there's one true meaning

06:37.080 --> 06:38.600
is inherently flawed,

06:38.600 --> 06:39.920
and the story becomes more about

06:39.920 --> 06:42.120
a general human quest for meaning.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.560
When people found the second ending,

06:43.560 --> 06:45.200
Jonathan Blow insisted the game

06:45.200 --> 06:47.000
still had more in it to find.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.200
This pissed off a lot of people

06:48.200 --> 06:49.560
who had combed the game's files

06:49.560 --> 06:51.800
and conclusively found that there weren't.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.680
But Blow was right.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.360
There is more to find,

06:55.360 --> 06:57.680
and it's this thing called personal meaning.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.720
Anyone can Google,

06:58.840 --> 07:00.520
what does the Princess represent,

07:00.520 --> 07:01.840
or the authors of the quotes

07:01.840 --> 07:03.240
that pepper the world's storybooks,

07:03.240 --> 07:05.560
but what makes Braid truly fascinating,

07:05.560 --> 07:07.840
at least in relative video game storytelling terms,

07:07.840 --> 07:10.040
is that you don't need any of that.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.600
You can think about its relevance to you individually.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.440
You can fill in the blanks of Tim's life

07:14.440 --> 07:17.160
and decisions and thoughts in your own particular way,

07:17.160 --> 07:18.400
and that's awesome.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.440
Number five.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.120
Some parts aren't fun on purpose, and this is fine.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.720
The game, if anything, is improved

07:22.720 --> 07:24.240
by the parts of it that are annoying.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.120
For example, there's a star you can only get

07:26.120 --> 07:28.040
by sitting and waiting two hours

07:28.040 --> 07:29.920
while a cloud moves across the screen.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.840
The game's hardest challenge is literally designed

07:31.840 --> 07:33.560
to be boring and unfun,

07:33.560 --> 07:35.360
to teach you something about how silly it is

07:35.360 --> 07:36.800
to seek 100% completion

07:36.800 --> 07:38.800
simply for the sake of having done everything.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
I like Jonathan Blow,

07:39.800 --> 07:41.800
and not just because I have the unstoppable urge

07:41.800 --> 07:43.680
to seek out people equally as pretentious

07:43.680 --> 07:45.080
and egotistical as me,

07:45.080 --> 07:46.600
but because he's not under any illusions

07:46.600 --> 07:47.800
about the game's failures.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.840
Even though the game purposefully has parts

07:49.840 --> 07:51.040
that aren't entertaining,

07:51.040 --> 07:53.240
Jonathan Blow doesn't use this as an excuse

07:53.240 --> 07:54.400
for bad game design.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.360
He's completely open about aspects of the game

07:56.360 --> 07:57.480
he feels he did wrong.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.080
And this cannon ends up killing people

07:59.080 --> 08:00.120
for no interesting reason.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.720
It's like, oh, I didn't go through with the right timing,

08:02.720 --> 08:04.240
and now I just have to try again and again,

08:04.240 --> 08:06.800
and some people, like, try 10 times to get through there.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.720
It's not cool.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.280
That's not what the game's about.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.760
This willingness to criticize his own design work,

08:11.760 --> 08:13.320
even while defending parts of the game

08:13.320 --> 08:14.760
that purposefully aren't fun,

08:14.760 --> 08:16.880
reveals the viability for games as a medium

08:16.880 --> 08:18.720
to be more than skinner boxes

08:18.720 --> 08:21.280
that give out good feelings when you do the right thing.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.360
This is just my opinion,

08:22.360 --> 08:24.040
but I think there's an artistic merit

08:24.040 --> 08:25.200
to annoying someone,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.600
or punishing them for acting without thinking,

08:27.600 --> 08:30.680
or making them wait for something they don't really need.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.160
This level doesn't even have a name

08:32.160 --> 08:33.360
because the feeling you get

08:33.360 --> 08:35.680
watching your own self die to help you

08:35.680 --> 08:37.840
can't be described in words.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.400
In being willing to explore these alternative emotions

08:40.400 --> 08:43.280
beyond simple satisfaction with having solved a puzzle,

08:43.280 --> 08:45.640
the game doesn't just do something different.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.640
It also makes a case for the power games

08:47.640 --> 08:50.680
can have as a medium to even do this sort of thing.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.920
That's pretty radical when you think about it.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.680
Except Blow is wrong about the cannon.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.080
He knows why you put it there.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.800
It's because he's a monster.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.680
["What a monster!" sound effect plays.]

08:59.680 --> 09:02.200
And finally, number six.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.720
Uhhhh, it's secretly a book!

09:04.720 --> 09:06.480
While lots of games have audio logs

09:06.480 --> 09:08.700
and journal entries that push the...

09:08.700 --> 09:10.480
While lots of games have audio logs

09:10.480 --> 09:12.640
and journal entries that push the plot forward

09:12.640 --> 09:13.880
in a basic way,

09:13.880 --> 09:15.720
few games encourage you to actually sit

09:15.720 --> 09:16.960
and think about something,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.880
or read what amounts to a story

09:18.880 --> 09:20.720
about a visit to your parents' house,

09:20.720 --> 09:22.320
quite like Braid does.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.600
The text portions are completely optional,

09:24.600 --> 09:26.520
but offer another layer of meaning

09:26.520 --> 09:28.400
to each world's gimmicks.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.760
It's quite well-written prose, too.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.720
Plenty of games have good writing

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
in the sense that characters say something funny

09:34.720 --> 09:36.440
or the story is explained...

09:36.440 --> 09:37.280
Ugh.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.600
Effectively.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.600
But I really can't think of another game

09:40.600 --> 09:43.320
that has writing in this specific sense,

09:43.320 --> 09:44.520
the sense where you can actually stop

09:44.520 --> 09:46.240
and contemplate its meaning,

09:46.240 --> 09:47.640
like with a good book.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.720
And I'm a fan of books myself.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.200
I'm a bookie.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.360
I'll see you all at BookCon 2016.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.800
I was gonna do the dramatic thing

09:56.800 --> 09:57.840
where I throw the books in the air

09:57.840 --> 09:58.680
and they collapse down,

09:58.680 --> 10:01.000
but that is not how you treat books.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.200
That is not right.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.480
Speaking of time travel,

10:03.480 --> 10:04.800
if I had the power to go back in time,

10:04.800 --> 10:07.480
I would use it to unread this.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.680
It's like a fucking early access beta

10:09.680 --> 10:11.200
of To Kill a Mockingbird.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.120
Also, I'd probably go back even further

10:13.120 --> 10:14.360
and become the head of Puffin,

10:14.360 --> 10:16.000
whoever publishes this garbage,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.640
and I would hire a better graphic designer,

10:18.640 --> 10:20.720
because you don't put the name of the previous book

10:20.720 --> 10:23.280
in the same size next to the text there,

10:23.280 --> 10:24.320
so it says,

10:24.320 --> 10:26.720
"'Ghostletter to Kill a Watchman, Mockingbird?'

10:26.720 --> 10:28.320
That doesn't make any sense.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.000
Get your ass in gear, Harper."

10:30.000 --> 10:31.920
Jonathan Blow's next game, The Witness,

10:31.920 --> 10:33.760
has audio logs as well,

10:33.760 --> 10:35.400
but uses them to tell a story

10:35.400 --> 10:37.960
in a kind of sideways way that's kind of cool.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.640
All the logs are quotes from various places

10:40.640 --> 10:43.120
that don't really have a direct relevance to the game

10:43.120 --> 10:45.240
in a way that I think forces you to go,

10:45.240 --> 10:46.080
what?

10:46.080 --> 10:49.120
And figure out what's actually going on for yourself

10:49.120 --> 10:51.160
without just, you know, piecing together,

10:51.160 --> 10:54.920
oh, this one says demons come through a hole,

10:54.920 --> 10:56.160
so now I know the story.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.000
Oh, great.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.160
Instead, imagine if you played a version of Doom 3

11:00.160 --> 11:02.920
where the diary entries were like a fucking

11:02.920 --> 11:04.880
two-minute quote from a philosopher,

11:04.880 --> 11:05.720
and you're like,

11:05.720 --> 11:08.200
what the fuck, John Carmack?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.280
Well, guess what?

11:09.280 --> 11:11.080
It would be a better game.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.800
The Witness also builds on these ideas

11:12.800 --> 11:14.840
by having a literal projection booth

11:14.840 --> 11:16.360
where you can sit and watch extracts

11:16.360 --> 11:18.080
from real documentaries.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.680
It's not the same as the books exactly,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.160
but it has a similar feel.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.840
You can watch James Burke talk about how art is worthless

11:23.840 --> 11:26.480
and have a good long think about the differing purposes

11:26.480 --> 11:27.720
of art and science.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.800
I think that's neat.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.480
Oh, spoilers, that happens in The Witness.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.320
Sorry.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.560
That should honestly be a new way that we rate games.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.560
You know, story, graphics, sound, gameplay.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.280
Can you listen to James Burke tell you that art is shit?

11:42.280 --> 11:44.040
You may find Blow himself pretentious

11:44.040 --> 11:45.560
or dumb or overreaching,

11:45.560 --> 11:47.000
but he made a fine game

11:47.000 --> 11:49.040
and encouraged people to think more about games

11:49.040 --> 11:50.760
and stories and even life.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.560
Even if, in your opinion, he's not the best at it,

11:53.560 --> 11:55.680
I think even attempting to think about these things

11:55.680 --> 11:56.520
has value.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.640
This week, I'd also like to spay an, spay, ah.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.800
This week, I'd also like to pay an extra special thanks

12:13.800 --> 12:17.000
to Amanda Beverley, Alexander Corbett,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.080
Ciaran Dachtler, Rob Brunt, Jenny Angel,

12:21.080 --> 12:22.760
and Kevin Knipe.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.720
Kneep.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.640
Tell me how to pronounce that

12:24.640 --> 12:25.640
and I'll do it better next time.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.560
I'm sorry.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.400
Thanks very much for watching.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.520
Hope you liked it.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.120
This is kind of a new thing for me,

12:30.120 --> 12:35.120
so please give me any constructive criticism you can,

12:35.320 --> 12:37.960
unless it's negative feedback,

12:37.960 --> 12:40.600
in which case, write it on a physical piece of paper

12:40.600 --> 12:42.320
and throw it in the bin.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.160
If you like this video,

12:43.480 --> 12:45.480
please consider giving me money on Patreon.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.440
For $2 or more, you can get access

12:47.440 --> 12:49.440
to a bunch of the bonus stuff

12:49.440 --> 12:50.880
that I either cut out of videos

12:50.880 --> 12:52.080
because it's like an outtake

12:52.080 --> 12:54.400
or just doesn't fit anymore.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.640
And just also stuff that can't go in

12:56.640 --> 12:57.880
because it's me playing through a game

12:57.880 --> 12:59.840
and talking over it for the sake of the footage

12:59.840 --> 13:01.280
for this video and stuff.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.120
If for my next video,

13:02.120 --> 13:04.640
you want me to talk about the philosophy of Dark Souls 2,

13:04.640 --> 13:07.320
and yes, specifically Dark Souls 2,

13:07.320 --> 13:11.280
click this sphinx on this side of the screen.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.960
But if instead you prefer me to talk about

13:13.760 --> 13:14.600
why Fallout 3 is garbage,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.480
please click on this orc-ized version

13:17.480 --> 13:19.440
of the originally interesting and cool

13:19.440 --> 13:21.920
Super Mutant characters from the original games.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.960
Say goodbye, Cody.

13:24.000 --> 13:24.960
Wave, wave at him.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.440
He doesn't speak English.
