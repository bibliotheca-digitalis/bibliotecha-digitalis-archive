00:00.000 --> 00:08.280
Hi, I'm Heritance Flimby, and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.

00:08.280 --> 00:27.560
I had another topic prepared for this week's SLAH, but something very pressing came up

00:27.560 --> 00:30.920
at the last minute that desperately needs addressing immediately.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.860
You're no doubt aware of the announcement for Super Mario Odyssey, the trailer for which

00:34.860 --> 00:41.020
features everyone's second favorite Italian fascist journeying to New Donk City?

00:41.020 --> 00:45.440
A world that somewhat resembles our own, populated by realistically proportioned people instead

00:45.440 --> 00:48.220
of other Mario-type people.

00:48.220 --> 00:52.460
The gameplay footage has an uncanny feel to it, of a world with textures and architecture

00:52.460 --> 00:58.280
and design a wide margin less cartoony than Mario, dwarfing him in size and complexity.

00:58.280 --> 01:05.280
And the internet, correctly, freaked the fuck out about this.

01:05.280 --> 01:35.100
So this time, apart from a certain other popular franchise

01:35.100 --> 01:56.300
mascot, I thought I'd interrogate precisely why this move would elicit this sort of response,

01:56.300 --> 02:01.300
and try to understand why Nintendo would even consider doing this horrible, horrible thing.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.000
Cut to the-

02:06.000 --> 02:10.140
We seemingly naturally understand this choice as a grotesque, weird thing.

02:10.140 --> 02:14.220
Nintendo are horrifically distorting the visual reality of their game's universe, like they

02:14.220 --> 02:17.540
did with the aptly named Weird Mushrooms in Mario Maker.

02:17.540 --> 02:20.540
Oh, Jesus Christ!

02:20.540 --> 02:24.900
You can call me pretentious, and believe me, many have tried, but when people describe

02:24.900 --> 02:30.020
things like this as, like the magic being stolen, and so on, these are codes for feeling

02:30.020 --> 02:34.500
uncomfortable in a way that's hard to explain, and as a man, I love lecturing people on what

02:34.500 --> 02:38.100
their feelings actually mean, so let's try to figure out these feelings.

02:38.100 --> 02:44.700
Why exactly is this so traumatizing for children and adults who film themselves watching advertising?

02:44.700 --> 02:49.340
Well, it really goes back to the inherent appeal in the design of mascot characters

02:49.340 --> 02:51.380
like Mario or Sonic in the first place.

02:51.380 --> 02:55.260
I mean, you can break the visual design of these characters down to their DNA, we can

02:55.260 --> 03:00.220
talk about roundness, softness, and acutely large or innocent-looking eyes, or interplay

03:00.220 --> 03:04.380
of base colors like blue and red with a soft orange for skin tones.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.620
But we have to go deeper!

03:06.620 --> 03:10.140
I can't be bothered to Google the Inception Horn sound effect, just pretend I made that

03:10.140 --> 03:11.140
joke here.

03:11.140 --> 03:15.260
Because it's easy to list specific things people find cute or visually appealing, the

03:15.260 --> 03:19.620
question is why, and that means delving into the psychology aspect of these characters

03:19.620 --> 03:23.940
and stories, which is more than just visual design, it's also to do with presentation

03:23.940 --> 03:24.940
and personality.

03:24.940 --> 03:27.940
Let's look at what Mario does.

03:27.940 --> 03:32.420
What contributes to the appeal of this character equally as much as his design is his attitude

03:32.420 --> 03:34.180
and behavior in games.

03:34.180 --> 03:40.540
He's perpetually in a good mood, he's happy-go-lucky, energetic, easily amused, and easy to please.

03:40.540 --> 03:44.180
Look how happy he is to have got a sh-shine?

03:44.180 --> 03:48.140
He probably doesn't even know what those are, and he's still happy to have one.

03:48.140 --> 03:53.100
You might have noticed that all these characteristics are also characteristics of those cute animals

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
we all know and love.

03:54.700 --> 03:59.380
Puppies are also perpetually amused, endlessly energetic and happy, and don't have to think

03:59.380 --> 04:00.700
about real problems.

04:00.700 --> 04:05.260
Yes, actual real puppies go to the bathroom, but when we think of these animals, our brain

04:05.260 --> 04:10.260
ignores those bits and fixates on all this cute stuff, just like it does playing a Mario

04:10.260 --> 04:11.260
game.

04:11.260 --> 04:13.860
Mario also lives in a world that permits cuteness.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.940
He's never punished for being optimistic.

04:15.940 --> 04:20.500
He can save the day when he puts his mind to it, and the world of Mario has been weirdly

04:20.500 --> 04:24.880
scrubbed of certain real-world problems and questions that it would be uncomfortable to

04:24.880 --> 04:27.620
actually have to deal with in a cartoon universe.

04:27.620 --> 04:31.980
There are certain questions the Mario universe doesn't let you think about.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.820
For example, what are Boos the ghosts of?

04:35.820 --> 04:36.820
See?

04:36.820 --> 04:40.820
That question probably just weirded you out just a little bit, didn't it?

04:40.820 --> 04:45.620
It's because you suddenly have to take into account that in this happy, silly world, people

04:45.620 --> 04:46.880
die.

04:46.880 --> 04:51.060
This is why Boos are so vague and scrubbed of identity, because otherwise, if they looked

04:51.060 --> 04:56.440
like the ghost of a dead person, that invites a lot of, like, weirdness that kind of gets

04:56.440 --> 05:00.320
in the way of the idea of being in this fun cartoon, you know?

05:00.320 --> 05:04.080
After death, the other main thing Nintendo works to remove reminders of in their games

05:04.080 --> 05:06.680
is, well, kind of obviously, sex.

05:06.680 --> 05:11.680
Because you see, sex is a kind of scary and complicated thing to a lot of people, and

05:11.680 --> 05:16.840
it's not something we ever really quite understand, but it's inherent to the real world, sadly.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.640
There's no way we can stop it from happening yet.

05:20.640 --> 05:25.160
Nintendo have worked very hard to remove sex from their ideological universe, up to and

05:25.160 --> 05:29.000
including the part where Bowser has lots of kids, but you never see the mother and

05:29.000 --> 05:31.560
she's never ever mentioned.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.800
In Mary of Sunshine, it's briefly brought up that Bowser Jr. thinks Peach is his mother,

05:35.800 --> 05:39.000
but when it's revealed that she isn't—because of course she isn't!

05:39.000 --> 05:44.720
OHHH!—they immediately move past the idea of raising the question of his mother's identity.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.400
Nintendo doesn't want people to think about this because—oh, Jesus.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.840
The images in my head are not—I'm not happy about this.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.520
They don't just emerge fully formed into the Mario universe.

05:56.520 --> 06:02.320
Heck, in Super Mario World 2, hashtag Yoshi's Island, it turns out that not even Mario

06:02.320 --> 06:05.240
is the product of, like, natural processes.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.160
A fucking stork carries him into the world.

06:09.160 --> 06:14.160
Storks exist entirely in folklore so parents could avoid telling kids about what sex and

06:14.160 --> 06:15.720
childbirth were?

06:15.720 --> 06:21.680
So now, and here's the million-dollar question, why are we so attracted as audiences to creatures

06:21.680 --> 06:25.680
that don't have a care in the world and story universes where the people never have

06:25.680 --> 06:31.040
to think about complicated problems like sex, death, or having to stick to a diet of more

06:31.040 --> 06:33.800
than mushrooms you magically find in blocks?

06:33.800 --> 06:38.440
And where cholesterol is real and it—it's probably gonna be the thing that kills you.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.760
What do we always say, Mario?

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
Hey, you slob!

06:40.760 --> 06:41.760
That's my pizza!

06:41.760 --> 06:48.760
You see, it all goes back to everyone's favorite depressing Frenchman, Jean-Paul Sartre.

06:48.840 --> 06:55.040
Sartre argued that life is so scary, burdensome, and full of bizarreness and doubt that humans

06:55.040 --> 06:58.400
encounter anguisse at the living nightmare of being.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.040
That's anguish if you speak a real language.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.280
We're screaming tubes of meat and we're all going to die.

07:05.280 --> 07:09.280
And on a deep level, we know this and we don't like being reminded about that.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.680
This is why, for example, many people are squeamish about seeing blood or injuries.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.680
It's a reminder of our mortality.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.160
So according to sssssssto...

07:18.160 --> 07:21.720
We live our lives in ways that avoid encountering reminders like this.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.260
We empathize with dogs because we idolize their state of being.

07:25.260 --> 07:29.560
We wish we could go through life perpetually amused, always happy without having to stop

07:29.560 --> 07:34.160
and think about death or mortgages or how the Switch is inevitably going to be ruined

07:34.160 --> 07:36.180
by Nintendo's usual bullshit.

07:36.180 --> 07:40.160
Like I said before, there are certain questions the Mario universe doesn't want you to ask

07:40.160 --> 07:45.220
of it, and the important point I want to make here is that that's why people like it.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.820
Everyone likes a joke, you know,

07:46.820 --> 07:50.020
Oh, Peach keeps inviting Mario over for some cake!

07:50.020 --> 07:53.140
Could cake be a euphemism for something?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.300
I would like you to stop making that joke.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.020
And I have a good reason why, though.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.060
Uh, first of all, it's just a bit crude, you know.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.700
But secondly, in the words of Sigmund Freud,

08:03.700 --> 08:05.700
sometimes a cake is just a cake.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.420
That's kind of the core appeal of Mario if you think about it for a few seconds.

08:10.420 --> 08:14.820
Mario is satisfied by just the idea of going and hanging out with someone and eating cake

08:15.380 --> 08:18.340
Like that would be a good day for him.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.100
And that would be enough.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.940
He doesn't need to, like, look for a romantic sexual partner.

08:23.940 --> 08:26.740
He's just this guy who's happy all the time.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.540
He says wahoo all day for no reason.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.780
Just when he jumps, he's a happy man.

08:31.780 --> 08:34.260
And that's precisely why people like him.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.300
It's basic escapism.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.940
Mario World, like a puppy YouTube compilation,

08:39.940 --> 08:43.940
is a place you can visit and briefly forget that you have real problems.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.420
In the words of Samuel Wonson,

08:46.420 --> 08:50.180
he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.980
We enjoy putting ourselves in the minds of people like Mario

08:52.980 --> 08:55.860
and idolize real-world creatures with simple mindsets

08:55.860 --> 08:59.940
because we're all trying to escape the pain and suffering of being human.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.660
And this immediately explains the revulsion people feel seeing footage of New Donk City.

09:04.660 --> 09:09.140
In sending Mario to a realistic place with people who look like they have real problems,

09:09.140 --> 09:13.380
the ideological spell, the magic, if you will, of Mario is broken.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.700
And this understandably makes people uncomfortable.

09:15.700 --> 09:19.220
The comparisons to Sonic Adventure and Sonic 06 are very apt too.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.420
They create the exact same cognitive dissonance.

09:22.420 --> 09:26.260
In Sonic 06, Sonic has a relationship with romantic elements

09:26.260 --> 09:28.580
with a human-ass human girl-woman,

09:28.580 --> 09:30.260
and in a moment of passion, she...

09:32.260 --> 09:36.020
Sonic loves Chili Dogs too much to ever need to touch a woman.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.060
And maybe, just maybe, that's why nerds like him.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.060
Have Nintendo pulled a Sonic 2006

09:41.060 --> 09:44.420
and just forgotten the core appeal of their most important mascot?

09:44.420 --> 09:45.700
Yeah, sure.

09:45.700 --> 09:49.060
Since what if Nintendo made horrible decisions with core franchises?

09:51.060 --> 09:52.260
Oh, fuck.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.300
Oh, fffffuuu—

09:55.300 --> 09:58.500
Interestingly enough, the game's literally named after The Odyssey.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.260
The Odyssey was a story by Homer,

10:00.260 --> 10:03.140
some pretentious guy who just went by his first name.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.780
It came out in about the mid-1940s?

10:05.780 --> 10:07.940
It's about a guy who, after losing all his friends

10:07.940 --> 10:11.060
and wasting a bunch of his life on a war the government sent him on,

10:11.060 --> 10:12.740
spends about ten years trying to get home,

10:12.740 --> 10:16.020
going on all kinds of scary and philosophically intriguing adventures

10:16.020 --> 10:17.620
in weird places on the way.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.860
It's a classic educational fantasy journey,

10:19.860 --> 10:23.700
very clearly inspired by Doctor Who or the Magic School Bus.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.540
In every chapter, Odysseus goes to a new place and learns an important lesson,

10:27.540 --> 10:30.420
like how shit it would be if he got eaten by a giant,

10:30.420 --> 10:33.460
or how confusing it would be if his name was Nobody.

10:33.460 --> 10:36.340
Overall, Homer's Odyssey is a solid 8 out of 10 story

10:36.340 --> 10:38.660
about getting accustomed to alien surroundings,

10:38.660 --> 10:40.660
a testing of a person's characteristics,

10:40.660 --> 10:44.100
and ultimately the story asks if you can ever really return home

10:44.100 --> 10:47.300
when the journey inherently changes what you even are.

10:49.780 --> 10:53.380
So what does a reference to this historic work say about Mario's journey?

10:53.380 --> 10:57.620
Is New Donk City just another place Mario can visit and then leave unscathed,

10:57.620 --> 11:00.180
like the Ice World, the Fire World,

11:00.180 --> 11:02.500
or the and Sonic at the Olympic Games...

11:03.380 --> 11:05.940
Or is it a journey that will forever change him

11:05.940 --> 11:09.220
and teach him horrifying lessons about the obscene cruelty

11:09.220 --> 11:10.100
of this world of...

11:10.980 --> 11:12.660
...Humans?

11:12.660 --> 11:13.860
Nah, I'm just kidding.

11:13.860 --> 11:16.580
Life in New Donk City probably isn't that complicated.

11:16.580 --> 11:20.500
Heck, the villain probably lives in a giant golden tower...

11:21.460 --> 11:22.660
...with his name written on it.

11:24.660 --> 11:25.860

There is, however, a tracer, uh, bobblehead in here.

12:06.340 --> 12:06.980
That's nice.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.940
Hey, that reminds me of someone else whose purpose in life is to go fast.

12:11.940 --> 12:12.440
I...

12:25.460 --> 12:25.960

A mysterious benefactor.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.580

14:56.340 --> 14:57.620
In case those of you were wondering,

14:57.620 --> 15:00.420
I only do these long credits on pretty long videos

15:00.420 --> 15:02.100
or when I only do a couple videos a month.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.500
I usually intend to do two or three

15:04.500 --> 15:06.340
and then split the credits out across them,

15:06.340 --> 15:07.860
but I haven't got around to that lately

15:07.860 --> 15:10.100
because I've always been super busy trying to make long stuff.

15:10.980 --> 15:12.260
So there's that.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.100
But basically, thanks a lot.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.380
It's fantastic.
