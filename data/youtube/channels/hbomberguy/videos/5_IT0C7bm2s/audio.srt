00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Hi, I'm Heritance Flimby, and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:27,560
I had another topic prepared for this week's SLAH, but something very pressing came up

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,920
at the last minute that desperately needs addressing immediately.

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,860
You're no doubt aware of the announcement for Super Mario Odyssey, the trailer for which

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,020
features everyone's second favorite Italian fascist journeying to New Donk City?

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,440
A world that somewhat resembles our own, populated by realistically proportioned people instead

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,220
of other Mario-type people.

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,460
The gameplay footage has an uncanny feel to it, of a world with textures and architecture

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,280
and design a wide margin less cartoony than Mario, dwarfing him in size and complexity.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,280
And the internet, correctly, freaked the fuck out about this.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:35,100
So this time, apart from a certain other popular franchise

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:56,300
mascot, I thought I'd interrogate precisely why this move would elicit this sort of response,

13
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,300
and try to understand why Nintendo would even consider doing this horrible, horrible thing.

14
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Cut to the-

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,140
We seemingly naturally understand this choice as a grotesque, weird thing.

16
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,220
Nintendo are horrifically distorting the visual reality of their game's universe, like they

17
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,540
did with the aptly named Weird Mushrooms in Mario Maker.

18
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,540
Oh, Jesus Christ!

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,900
You can call me pretentious, and believe me, many have tried, but when people describe

20
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,020
things like this as, like the magic being stolen, and so on, these are codes for feeling

21
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,500
uncomfortable in a way that's hard to explain, and as a man, I love lecturing people on what

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,100
their feelings actually mean, so let's try to figure out these feelings.

23
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,700
Why exactly is this so traumatizing for children and adults who film themselves watching advertising?

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,340
Well, it really goes back to the inherent appeal in the design of mascot characters

25
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,380
like Mario or Sonic in the first place.

26
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,260
I mean, you can break the visual design of these characters down to their DNA, we can

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,220
talk about roundness, softness, and acutely large or innocent-looking eyes, or interplay

28
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,380
of base colors like blue and red with a soft orange for skin tones.

29
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,620
But we have to go deeper!

30
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,140
I can't be bothered to Google the Inception Horn sound effect, just pretend I made that

31
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
joke here.

32
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,260
Because it's easy to list specific things people find cute or visually appealing, the

33
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,620
question is why, and that means delving into the psychology aspect of these characters

34
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,940
and stories, which is more than just visual design, it's also to do with presentation

35
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
and personality.

36
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,940
Let's look at what Mario does.

37
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,420
What contributes to the appeal of this character equally as much as his design is his attitude

38
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,180
and behavior in games.

39
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,540
He's perpetually in a good mood, he's happy-go-lucky, energetic, easily amused, and easy to please.

40
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,180
Look how happy he is to have got a sh-shine?

41
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,140
He probably doesn't even know what those are, and he's still happy to have one.

42
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,100
You might have noticed that all these characteristics are also characteristics of those cute animals

43
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
we all know and love.

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,380
Puppies are also perpetually amused, endlessly energetic and happy, and don't have to think

45
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,700
about real problems.

46
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,260
Yes, actual real puppies go to the bathroom, but when we think of these animals, our brain

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,260
ignores those bits and fixates on all this cute stuff, just like it does playing a Mario

48
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
game.

49
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,860
Mario also lives in a world that permits cuteness.

50
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,940
He's never punished for being optimistic.

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,500
He can save the day when he puts his mind to it, and the world of Mario has been weirdly

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,880
scrubbed of certain real-world problems and questions that it would be uncomfortable to

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,620
actually have to deal with in a cartoon universe.

54
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,980
There are certain questions the Mario universe doesn't let you think about.

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,820
For example, what are Boos the ghosts of?

56
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,820
See?

57
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,820
That question probably just weirded you out just a little bit, didn't it?

58
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,620
It's because you suddenly have to take into account that in this happy, silly world, people

59
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,880
die.

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,060
This is why Boos are so vague and scrubbed of identity, because otherwise, if they looked

61
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,440
like the ghost of a dead person, that invites a lot of, like, weirdness that kind of gets

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,320
in the way of the idea of being in this fun cartoon, you know?

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
After death, the other main thing Nintendo works to remove reminders of in their games

64
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,680
is, well, kind of obviously, sex.

65
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Because you see, sex is a kind of scary and complicated thing to a lot of people, and

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,840
it's not something we ever really quite understand, but it's inherent to the real world, sadly.

67
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,640
There's no way we can stop it from happening yet.

68
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,160
Nintendo have worked very hard to remove sex from their ideological universe, up to and

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,000
including the part where Bowser has lots of kids, but you never see the mother and

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,560
she's never ever mentioned.

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,800
In Mary of Sunshine, it's briefly brought up that Bowser Jr. thinks Peach is his mother,

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,000
but when it's revealed that she isn't—because of course she isn't!

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,720
OHHH!—they immediately move past the idea of raising the question of his mother's identity.

74
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
Nintendo doesn't want people to think about this because—oh, Jesus.

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,840
The images in my head are not—I'm not happy about this.

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,520
They don't just emerge fully formed into the Mario universe.

77
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Heck, in Super Mario World 2, hashtag Yoshi's Island, it turns out that not even Mario

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,240
is the product of, like, natural processes.

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,160
A fucking stork carries him into the world.

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Storks exist entirely in folklore so parents could avoid telling kids about what sex and

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
childbirth were?

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,680
So now, and here's the million-dollar question, why are we so attracted as audiences to creatures

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
that don't have a care in the world and story universes where the people never have

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,040
to think about complicated problems like sex, death, or having to stick to a diet of more

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,800
than mushrooms you magically find in blocks?

86
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,440
And where cholesterol is real and it—it's probably gonna be the thing that kills you.

87
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
What do we always say, Mario?

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Hey, you slob!

89
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
That's my pizza!

90
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,760
You see, it all goes back to everyone's favorite depressing Frenchman, Jean-Paul Sartre.

91
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,040
Sartre argued that life is so scary, burdensome, and full of bizarreness and doubt that humans

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,400
encounter anguisse at the living nightmare of being.

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,040
That's anguish if you speak a real language.

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,280
We're screaming tubes of meat and we're all going to die.

95
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
And on a deep level, we know this and we don't like being reminded about that.

96
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,680
This is why, for example, many people are squeamish about seeing blood or injuries.

97
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
It's a reminder of our mortality.

98
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
So according to sssssssto...

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,720
We live our lives in ways that avoid encountering reminders like this.

100
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,260
We empathize with dogs because we idolize their state of being.

101
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,560
We wish we could go through life perpetually amused, always happy without having to stop

102
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,160
and think about death or mortgages or how the Switch is inevitably going to be ruined

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,180
by Nintendo's usual bullshit.

104
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,160
Like I said before, there are certain questions the Mario universe doesn't want you to ask

105
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,220
of it, and the important point I want to make here is that that's why people like it.

106
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,820
Everyone likes a joke, you know,

107
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,020
Oh, Peach keeps inviting Mario over for some cake!

108
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,140
Could cake be a euphemism for something?

109
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,300
I would like you to stop making that joke.

110
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,020
And I have a good reason why, though.

111
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,060
Uh, first of all, it's just a bit crude, you know.

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,700
But secondly, in the words of Sigmund Freud,

113
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
sometimes a cake is just a cake.

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,420
That's kind of the core appeal of Mario if you think about it for a few seconds.

115
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,820
Mario is satisfied by just the idea of going and hanging out with someone and eating cake

116
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,340
Like that would be a good day for him.

117
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,100
And that would be enough.

118
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,940
He doesn't need to, like, look for a romantic sexual partner.

119
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,740
He's just this guy who's happy all the time.

120
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,540
He says wahoo all day for no reason.

121
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,780
Just when he jumps, he's a happy man.

122
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,260
And that's precisely why people like him.

123
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,300
It's basic escapism.

124
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,940
Mario World, like a puppy YouTube compilation,

125
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,940
is a place you can visit and briefly forget that you have real problems.

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,420
In the words of Samuel Wonson,

127
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,180
he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.

128
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,980
We enjoy putting ourselves in the minds of people like Mario

129
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,860
and idolize real-world creatures with simple mindsets

130
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,940
because we're all trying to escape the pain and suffering of being human.

131
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,660
And this immediately explains the revulsion people feel seeing footage of New Donk City.

132
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,140
In sending Mario to a realistic place with people who look like they have real problems,

133
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,380
the ideological spell, the magic, if you will, of Mario is broken.

134
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,700
And this understandably makes people uncomfortable.

135
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,220
The comparisons to Sonic Adventure and Sonic 06 are very apt too.

136
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,420
They create the exact same cognitive dissonance.

137
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,260
In Sonic 06, Sonic has a relationship with romantic elements

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,580
with a human-ass human girl-woman,

139
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,260
and in a moment of passion, she...

140
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,020
Sonic loves Chili Dogs too much to ever need to touch a woman.

141
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,060
And maybe, just maybe, that's why nerds like him.

142
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Have Nintendo pulled a Sonic 2006

143
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,420
and just forgotten the core appeal of their most important mascot?

144
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,700
Yeah, sure.

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,060
Since what if Nintendo made horrible decisions with core franchises?

146
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,260
Oh, fuck.

147
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,300
Oh, fffffuuu—

148
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,500
Interestingly enough, the game's literally named after The Odyssey.

149
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,260
The Odyssey was a story by Homer,

150
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,140
some pretentious guy who just went by his first name.

151
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,780
It came out in about the mid-1940s?

152
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,940
It's about a guy who, after losing all his friends

153
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,060
and wasting a bunch of his life on a war the government sent him on,

154
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,740
spends about ten years trying to get home,

155
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,020
going on all kinds of scary and philosophically intriguing adventures

156
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,620
in weird places on the way.

157
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,860
It's a classic educational fantasy journey,

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,700
very clearly inspired by Doctor Who or the Magic School Bus.

159
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,540
In every chapter, Odysseus goes to a new place and learns an important lesson,

160
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,420
like how shit it would be if he got eaten by a giant,

161
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,460
or how confusing it would be if his name was Nobody.

162
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,340
Overall, Homer's Odyssey is a solid 8 out of 10 story

163
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,660
about getting accustomed to alien surroundings,

164
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
a testing of a person's characteristics,

165
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,100
and ultimately the story asks if you can ever really return home

166
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,300
when the journey inherently changes what you even are.

167
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,380
So what does a reference to this historic work say about Mario's journey?

168
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,620
Is New Donk City just another place Mario can visit and then leave unscathed,

169
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,180
like the Ice World, the Fire World,

170
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,500
or the and Sonic at the Olympic Games...

171
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,940
Or is it a journey that will forever change him

172
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,220
and teach him horrifying lessons about the obscene cruelty

173
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,100
of this world of...

174
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,660
...Humans?

175
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,860
Nah, I'm just kidding.

176
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,580
Life in New Donk City probably isn't that complicated.

177
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,500
Heck, the villain probably lives in a giant golden tower...

178
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,660
...with his name written on it.

179
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,860

In case those of you were wondering,

306
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,420
I only do these long credits on pretty long videos

307
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
or when I only do a couple videos a month.

308
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,500
I usually intend to do two or three

309
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,340
and then split the credits out across them,

310
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,860
but I haven't got around to that lately

311
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,100
because I've always been super busy trying to make long stuff.

312
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,260
So there's that.

313
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,100

314
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,380
