0	8280	Hi, I'm Heritance Flimby, and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.
8280	27560	I had another topic prepared for this week's SLAH, but something very pressing came up
27560	30920	at the last minute that desperately needs addressing immediately.
30920	34860	You're no doubt aware of the announcement for Super Mario Odyssey, the trailer for which
34860	41020	features everyone's second favorite Italian fascist journeying to New Donk City?
41020	45440	A world that somewhat resembles our own, populated by realistically proportioned people instead
45440	48220	of other Mario-type people.
48220	52460	The gameplay footage has an uncanny feel to it, of a world with textures and architecture
52460	58280	and design a wide margin less cartoony than Mario, dwarfing him in size and complexity.
58280	65280	And the internet, correctly, freaked the fuck out about this.
65280	95100	So this time, apart from a certain other popular franchise
95100	116300	mascot, I thought I'd interrogate precisely why this move would elicit this sort of response,
116300	121300	and try to understand why Nintendo would even consider doing this horrible, horrible thing.
125500	126000	Cut to the-
126000	130140	We seemingly naturally understand this choice as a grotesque, weird thing.
130140	134220	Nintendo are horrifically distorting the visual reality of their game's universe, like they
134220	137540	did with the aptly named Weird Mushrooms in Mario Maker.
137540	140540	Oh, Jesus Christ!
140540	144900	You can call me pretentious, and believe me, many have tried, but when people describe
144900	150020	things like this as, like the magic being stolen, and so on, these are codes for feeling
150020	154500	uncomfortable in a way that's hard to explain, and as a man, I love lecturing people on what
154500	158100	their feelings actually mean, so let's try to figure out these feelings.
158100	164700	Why exactly is this so traumatizing for children and adults who film themselves watching advertising?
164700	169340	Well, it really goes back to the inherent appeal in the design of mascot characters
169340	171380	like Mario or Sonic in the first place.
171380	175260	I mean, you can break the visual design of these characters down to their DNA, we can
175260	180220	talk about roundness, softness, and acutely large or innocent-looking eyes, or interplay
180220	184380	of base colors like blue and red with a soft orange for skin tones.
184380	186620	But we have to go deeper!
186620	190140	I can't be bothered to Google the Inception Horn sound effect, just pretend I made that
190140	191140	joke here.
191140	195260	Because it's easy to list specific things people find cute or visually appealing, the
195260	199620	question is why, and that means delving into the psychology aspect of these characters
199620	203940	and stories, which is more than just visual design, it's also to do with presentation
203940	204940	and personality.
204940	207940	Let's look at what Mario does.
207940	212420	What contributes to the appeal of this character equally as much as his design is his attitude
212420	214180	and behavior in games.
214180	220540	He's perpetually in a good mood, he's happy-go-lucky, energetic, easily amused, and easy to please.
220540	224180	Look how happy he is to have got a sh-shine?
224180	228140	He probably doesn't even know what those are, and he's still happy to have one.
228140	233100	You might have noticed that all these characteristics are also characteristics of those cute animals
233100	234700	we all know and love.
234700	239380	Puppies are also perpetually amused, endlessly energetic and happy, and don't have to think
239380	240700	about real problems.
240700	245260	Yes, actual real puppies go to the bathroom, but when we think of these animals, our brain
245260	250260	ignores those bits and fixates on all this cute stuff, just like it does playing a Mario
250260	251260	game.
251260	253860	Mario also lives in a world that permits cuteness.
253860	255940	He's never punished for being optimistic.
255940	260500	He can save the day when he puts his mind to it, and the world of Mario has been weirdly
260500	264880	scrubbed of certain real-world problems and questions that it would be uncomfortable to
264880	267620	actually have to deal with in a cartoon universe.
267620	271980	There are certain questions the Mario universe doesn't let you think about.
271980	275820	For example, what are Boos the ghosts of?
275820	276820	See?
276820	280820	That question probably just weirded you out just a little bit, didn't it?
280820	285620	It's because you suddenly have to take into account that in this happy, silly world, people
285620	286880	die.
286880	291060	This is why Boos are so vague and scrubbed of identity, because otherwise, if they looked
291060	296440	like the ghost of a dead person, that invites a lot of, like, weirdness that kind of gets
296440	300320	in the way of the idea of being in this fun cartoon, you know?
300320	304080	After death, the other main thing Nintendo works to remove reminders of in their games
304080	306680	is, well, kind of obviously, sex.
306680	311680	Because you see, sex is a kind of scary and complicated thing to a lot of people, and
311680	316840	it's not something we ever really quite understand, but it's inherent to the real world, sadly.
316840	320640	There's no way we can stop it from happening yet.
320640	325160	Nintendo have worked very hard to remove sex from their ideological universe, up to and
325160	329000	including the part where Bowser has lots of kids, but you never see the mother and
329000	331560	she's never ever mentioned.
331560	335800	In Mary of Sunshine, it's briefly brought up that Bowser Jr. thinks Peach is his mother,
335800	339000	but when it's revealed that she isn't—because of course she isn't!
339000	344720	OHHH!—they immediately move past the idea of raising the question of his mother's identity.
344720	348400	Nintendo doesn't want people to think about this because—oh, Jesus.
348400	352840	The images in my head are not—I'm not happy about this.
352840	356520	They don't just emerge fully formed into the Mario universe.
356520	362320	Heck, in Super Mario World 2, hashtag Yoshi's Island, it turns out that not even Mario
362320	365240	is the product of, like, natural processes.
365240	369160	A fucking stork carries him into the world.
369160	374160	Storks exist entirely in folklore so parents could avoid telling kids about what sex and
374160	375720	childbirth were?
375720	381680	So now, and here's the million-dollar question, why are we so attracted as audiences to creatures
381680	385680	that don't have a care in the world and story universes where the people never have
385680	391040	to think about complicated problems like sex, death, or having to stick to a diet of more
391040	393800	than mushrooms you magically find in blocks?
393800	398440	And where cholesterol is real and it—it's probably gonna be the thing that kills you.
398440	399760	What do we always say, Mario?
399760	400760	Hey, you slob!
400760	401760	That's my pizza!
401760	408760	You see, it all goes back to everyone's favorite depressing Frenchman, Jean-Paul Sartre.
408840	415040	Sartre argued that life is so scary, burdensome, and full of bizarreness and doubt that humans
415040	418400	encounter anguisse at the living nightmare of being.
418400	421040	That's anguish if you speak a real language.
421040	425280	We're screaming tubes of meat and we're all going to die.
425280	429280	And on a deep level, we know this and we don't like being reminded about that.
429280	433680	This is why, for example, many people are squeamish about seeing blood or injuries.
433680	435680	It's a reminder of our mortality.
435680	438160	So according to sssssssto...
438160	441720	We live our lives in ways that avoid encountering reminders like this.
441720	445260	We empathize with dogs because we idolize their state of being.
445260	449560	We wish we could go through life perpetually amused, always happy without having to stop
449560	454160	and think about death or mortgages or how the Switch is inevitably going to be ruined
454160	456180	by Nintendo's usual bullshit.
456180	460160	Like I said before, there are certain questions the Mario universe doesn't want you to ask
460160	465220	of it, and the important point I want to make here is that that's why people like it.
465460	466820	Everyone likes a joke, you know,
466820	470020	Oh, Peach keeps inviting Mario over for some cake!
470020	473140	Could cake be a euphemism for something?
473140	475300	I would like you to stop making that joke.
476580	478020	And I have a good reason why, though.
478020	481060	Uh, first of all, it's just a bit crude, you know.
481060	483700	But secondly, in the words of Sigmund Freud,
483700	485700	sometimes a cake is just a cake.
486660	490420	That's kind of the core appeal of Mario if you think about it for a few seconds.
490420	494820	Mario is satisfied by just the idea of going and hanging out with someone and eating cake
495380	498340	Like that would be a good day for him.
498980	500100	And that would be enough.
500100	503940	He doesn't need to, like, look for a romantic sexual partner.
503940	506740	He's just this guy who's happy all the time.
506740	509540	He says wahoo all day for no reason.
509540	511780	Just when he jumps, he's a happy man.
511780	514260	And that's precisely why people like him.
515780	517300	It's basic escapism.
517300	519940	Mario World, like a puppy YouTube compilation,
519940	523940	is a place you can visit and briefly forget that you have real problems.
523940	526420	In the words of Samuel Wonson,
526420	530180	he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.
530180	532980	We enjoy putting ourselves in the minds of people like Mario
532980	535860	and idolize real-world creatures with simple mindsets
535860	539940	because we're all trying to escape the pain and suffering of being human.
539940	544660	And this immediately explains the revulsion people feel seeing footage of New Donk City.
544660	549140	In sending Mario to a realistic place with people who look like they have real problems,
549140	553380	the ideological spell, the magic, if you will, of Mario is broken.
553380	555700	And this understandably makes people uncomfortable.
555700	559220	The comparisons to Sonic Adventure and Sonic 06 are very apt too.
559220	562420	They create the exact same cognitive dissonance.
562420	566260	In Sonic 06, Sonic has a relationship with romantic elements
566260	568580	with a human-ass human girl-woman,
568580	570260	and in a moment of passion, she...
572260	576020	Sonic loves Chili Dogs too much to ever need to touch a woman.
576020	579060	And maybe, just maybe, that's why nerds like him.
579060	581060	Have Nintendo pulled a Sonic 2006
581060	584420	and just forgotten the core appeal of their most important mascot?
584420	585700	Yeah, sure.
585700	589060	Since what if Nintendo made horrible decisions with core franchises?
591060	592260	Oh, fuck.
593220	595300	Oh, fffffuuu—
595300	598500	Interestingly enough, the game's literally named after The Odyssey.
598500	600260	The Odyssey was a story by Homer,
600260	603140	some pretentious guy who just went by his first name.
603140	605780	It came out in about the mid-1940s?
605780	607940	It's about a guy who, after losing all his friends
607940	611060	and wasting a bunch of his life on a war the government sent him on,
611060	612740	spends about ten years trying to get home,
612740	616020	going on all kinds of scary and philosophically intriguing adventures
616020	617620	in weird places on the way.
617620	619860	It's a classic educational fantasy journey,
619860	623700	very clearly inspired by Doctor Who or the Magic School Bus.
623700	627540	In every chapter, Odysseus goes to a new place and learns an important lesson,
627540	630420	like how shit it would be if he got eaten by a giant,
630420	633460	or how confusing it would be if his name was Nobody.
633460	636340	Overall, Homer's Odyssey is a solid 8 out of 10 story
636340	638660	about getting accustomed to alien surroundings,
638660	640660	a testing of a person's characteristics,
640660	644100	and ultimately the story asks if you can ever really return home
644100	647300	when the journey inherently changes what you even are.
649780	653380	So what does a reference to this historic work say about Mario's journey?
653380	657620	Is New Donk City just another place Mario can visit and then leave unscathed,
657620	660180	like the Ice World, the Fire World,
660180	662500	or the and Sonic at the Olympic Games...
663380	665940	Or is it a journey that will forever change him
665940	669220	and teach him horrifying lessons about the obscene cruelty
669220	670100	of this world of...
670980	672660	...Humans?
672660	673860	Nah, I'm just kidding.
673860	676580	Life in New Donk City probably isn't that complicated.
676580	680500	Heck, the villain probably lives in a giant golden tower...
681460	682660	...with his name written on it.

900420	902100	or when I only do a couple videos a month.
902980	904500	I usually intend to do two or three
904500	906340	and then split the credits out across them,
906340	907860	but I haven't got around to that lately
907860	910100	because I've always been super busy trying to make long stuff.
910980	912260	So there's that.
912260	914100	But basically, thanks a lot.
914100	915380	It's fantastic.
915380	920580	♪♪
