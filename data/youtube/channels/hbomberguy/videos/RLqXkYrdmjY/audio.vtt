WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This vid...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Pfft.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.800
Oh, you like your peanut butter, don't you, Mortimer?

00:10.800 --> 00:13.360
Oh, he's a good boy, aww.

00:13.360 --> 00:19.200
Hey, friends! Did you know that climate change is definitely real and definitely affected by human action?

00:19.200 --> 00:26.320
I had to ask because, well, some people deny that that's happening, and this video is about them.

00:26.320 --> 00:32.000
Now, I'm not here to pretend that there's a real debate in science about whether CO2 affects global temperatures,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
or whether humans have a hand in it.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.480
The science is settled and the deniers are wrong.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.960
Oh, yeah, call them deniers to make them look bad.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.760
That's a classic straw man argument.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.880
They're not denying climate change, they're just skeptical that it's happening.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.520
See, it's actually very smart when you put it that way.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.160
And look how this degenerate refuses to engage in reasonable debate with people who disagree with him.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.160
That's not rational at all.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.160
How can the issue be settled if you haven't debunked your opponent's points?

01:04.160 --> 01:05.440
Look, mate, I hate to be dogmatic, but-

01:05.440 --> 01:06.560
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

01:06.560 --> 01:13.840
But I think any reasonable analysis of climate deniers has to contend with the extreme deficit of actual facts

01:13.840 --> 01:18.800
on the side of people who claim to be the ones who know the facts better than the actual researchers.

01:18.800 --> 01:24.560
When someone specifically positions themselves as pro-science and fetishizes the idea of reason,

01:24.560 --> 01:28.400
the fact they're being unreasonable is something that needs to be brought up.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.240
We're gonna get into it, but if someone's evidence is so poor that even me,

01:32.240 --> 01:36.720
a gaming YouTuber who got peanut butter in his ear when he was setting up the first shot for this video,

01:36.720 --> 01:40.640
can see the holes in it, then something's really gone wrong here.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.440
So in this video, we're gonna look at some prominent climate deniers,

01:43.440 --> 01:46.800
what they have to say, why what they say is clearly wrong,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.640
why they seem to believe it anyway,

01:48.640 --> 01:51.120
how people get to be climate deniers,

01:51.120 --> 01:54.560
and what we can do to have- make there be less of the-

01:54.560 --> 01:56.880
...

01:56.880 --> 01:57.520
Nailed it!

01:57.520 --> 02:00.640
I suppose one thing you could do is just let the ice sheets melt.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.280
I mean, the problem would kind of go away if most of them drowned.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.680
Ooh! Oh! I'm dying!

02:07.680 --> 02:09.360
Oh, I guess I was wrong!

02:09.360 --> 02:09.920
Oops!

02:09.920 --> 02:14.720
...

02:14.720 --> 02:16.080
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

02:16.080 --> 02:18.880
...

02:18.880 --> 02:22.320
Now, climate denialism doesn't come in just one flavor.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.840
No, like ogres, the issue has layers.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.360
And unlike ogres, climate deniers are not all-stars.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.160
Although the ice they skate is getting pretty thin,

02:32.160 --> 02:35.280
and the water's getting warm, so they might as well swim.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.520
Smash Mouth's all-star was about climate change.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.720
CHANGE MY MIND!

02:38.720 --> 02:41.920
Deniers range from claiming the climate isn't actually changing at all

02:41.920 --> 02:45.120
to admitting that the climate changes but that humans don't have an effect

02:45.120 --> 02:47.440
and it's probably just normal that things have got so warm lately.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.880
I'm sure it'll go back to normal soon.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.000
To claiming that CO2 doesn't really have an effect on the climate.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.400
To saying that even if it does, it's actually good for us since plants need CO2.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.560
To saying it's real but it's not that bad and scientists are exaggerating.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.720
To saying, well, look, I'm confused.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.720
A lot of people are saying a lot of different things,

03:04.720 --> 03:07.520
so I guess it's still up for debate and we shouldn't do anything.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.400
Ah, that's great.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.040
See, even cowards have a place in denialism.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.640
If you haven't heard of Ben Shapiro,

03:12.640 --> 03:14.960
then your YouTube recommendations bar is glitched out.

03:14.960 --> 03:19.440
Shapiro is a conservative commentator who's very popular with people who already agree with him

03:19.440 --> 03:23.040
and he's really good at winning debates with teenagers who haven't finished university

03:23.040 --> 03:25.200
and don't have all the media training he has.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.440
He was editor-at-large of Breitbart for four years

03:27.440 --> 03:29.840
and he's written ten books about how it's the left's fault

03:29.840 --> 03:32.560
that conservatism keeps making things worse for everyone.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.400
He's a true intellectual gymnast,

03:34.400 --> 03:37.280
the kind that can write tweets decrying when the left talk about

03:37.280 --> 03:39.120
how they're on the right side of history

03:39.120 --> 03:42.800
and then publish an entire book called The Right Side of History.

03:42.800 --> 03:47.200
Here he is, dipping his webbed flippers into the pool of climate change

03:47.200 --> 03:50.160
with his signature Shapiro intellect.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.400
So let's say, let's say, for the sake of argument,

03:52.400 --> 03:56.960
that all of the water levels around the world rise by, let's say, five feet

03:56.960 --> 03:57.840
over the next hundred years.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.360
Say ten feet by the next hundred years

03:59.360 --> 04:03.520
and it puts all the low-lying areas on the coast underwater.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.520
Right? Which, let's say all of that happens.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.320
You think that people aren't going to just sell their homes and move?

04:08.320 --> 04:22.960
Just one small problem.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.440
Sell their houses to who, Ben?

04:25.440 --> 04:27.200
Fucking Aquaman!

04:39.280 --> 04:43.120
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

04:43.120 --> 04:45.040
Sigh.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.040
It was watching this talk by Shapiro that got me wanting to

04:49.040 --> 04:51.840
look at and analyze climate denial in more detail

04:51.840 --> 04:54.880
because this absolute genius-brained idea that

04:54.880 --> 04:58.800
everyone affected by things like floods can just sell their homes

04:58.800 --> 05:02.320
to people who would love to buy a flooding house, apparently,

05:02.320 --> 05:04.000
and move somewhere else,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.280
well, it begs a lot of questions about how these people think.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.000
How have things reached a point where someone thinks they can get away

05:10.000 --> 05:13.520
with saying something this ridiculous in front of an audience of people,

05:13.520 --> 05:16.000
and how have things reached a point where some people in that audience

05:16.000 --> 05:19.520
won't recognize it for the obvious, ignorant bullshit that it is?

05:19.520 --> 05:22.640
This led me down a particular hole of discovery.

05:22.640 --> 05:26.480
I realized that climate deniers aren't just wrong.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.520
They're obviously wrong in very clear ways,

05:29.520 --> 05:32.000
and that makes the whole thing so much more interesting.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.520
How does this work if it's so paper-thin?

05:35.520 --> 05:37.040
Take, for example, Stephen Crowder.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.680
Stephen Crowder is a conservative political commentator,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.600
and Wikipedia tells me he's a comedian,

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
which I'm glad they mentioned or I wouldn't have noticed.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.760
Crowder's YouTube channel is his special place

05:45.760 --> 05:48.400
to wax lyrical about topical conservative issues.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.880
He's a rational thinker who doesn't play by anyone's rules

05:50.880 --> 05:52.880
and will follow truth wherever it leads,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.360
although it always seems to lead to whatever he wanted to believe

05:55.360 --> 05:56.240
in the first place.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.720
I'm sure it's just a coincidence that he never has to change his mind

05:58.720 --> 05:59.360
about anything.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.400
Crowder has a big beef with Bill Nye, as we've seen in the past,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.520
but that's a byproduct of his more general climate denial.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.000
Of course, Crowder denies being a climate denier.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.320
Crowder positions himself as a climate realist

06:10.320 --> 06:13.280
who acknowledges that the climate has changed and is changing.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.280
It's just not changing in the way that all the scientists say it does.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.280
In other words, he's denying the science

06:19.280 --> 06:21.360
but in denial about denying the science.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.400
His most popular video on the topic has almost two million views

06:24.400 --> 06:27.200
and claims to debunk the top five climate change myths.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.480
We'll get to his others later.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.800
Regarding this one first, however, he's wrong.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.040
This video and everything in it has been debunked

06:33.120 --> 06:37.440
repeatedly and epically by many people online on the internet already,

06:37.440 --> 06:39.360
so I'm not gonna really do that too much.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.760
Okay, you've noticed it by now. There's no avoiding it.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.920
Uh, when I was hitting the wall with the axe,

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
I got a little bit of debris on my mouth

06:45.920 --> 06:47.600
and I didn't notice it for a couple takes.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.880
Just try not to look at it and we'll all get through it together.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.560
What I want to draw attention to here is how blatantly wrong it is

06:54.560 --> 06:57.360
to anyone who's willing to do even a smidgen of research.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.720
One of the myths he tries to debunk is that the ice sheets are melting.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.800
Number two, you've heard this one everywhere.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.880
The ice sheets are melting!

07:04.880 --> 07:08.320
If the ice sheets were melting, it would cause an increase in sea levels

07:08.320 --> 07:11.600
as all of the water in the ice makes its way into the oceans.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.640
It would also increase CO2 levels because CO2 is stored in ice

07:16.640 --> 07:18.320
and then escapes when it melts.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.160
It would affect the albedo of the planet,

07:20.160 --> 07:24.160
its ability to reflect, uh, the heat and light of the sun.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.080
It wouldn't just make things worse on its own,

07:26.080 --> 07:29.280
it would exacerbate the process by which things are getting worse.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.000
But don't worry, Steven Crowder's done a picosecond of googling

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
and he's decided that they're not melting.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.520
In fact, they're growing!

07:37.520 --> 07:42.080
The Antarctic ice sheets are actually growing by billions of tons per year.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.320
Does that come to me from climatechangedenialslashflatearthers.com?

07:46.320 --> 07:47.840
No, how about NASA?

07:47.840 --> 07:49.680
According to the new analysis of satellite data,

07:49.680 --> 07:55.200
the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice per year

07:55.200 --> 07:57.200
from 1992 to 2001.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.920
Oh, shit, he's using facts and logic!

07:59.920 --> 08:01.040
Sound the alarms!

08:01.040 --> 08:02.160
Battle stations!

08:02.160 --> 08:03.200
Prepare for impact!

08:04.080 --> 08:05.840
Actually, one question.

08:05.840 --> 08:11.200
When you said ice sheets, that's a plural sound.

08:12.720 --> 08:17.840
Could it be that there's another ice sheet, say, in Greenland,

08:18.800 --> 08:23.280
where the opposite is true and it's melting really quickly

08:24.080 --> 08:26.800
and maybe there's a net loss of ice?

08:27.440 --> 08:28.640
I wonder what he'll say about it.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.520
He doesn't bring it up.

08:29.520 --> 08:29.920
He doesn't.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.680
Just pretend Greenland doesn't exist.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.760
According to the European Environmental Agency,

08:33.760 --> 08:36.800
between the years of 2002 to 2011,

08:36.800 --> 08:41.760
Greenland lost an average of 215 billion tons of ice per year.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.800
Then in 2012, it lost 500 billion.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.160
So if you do some quick maths there,

08:46.160 --> 08:50.720
you'll probably notice that even if Antarctica is growing at the rate Crowder says it is,

08:50.720 --> 08:52.400
which we'll get back to that later,

08:52.400 --> 08:57.680
over 100 billion tons of ice per year is now water in our oceans,

08:57.680 --> 09:01.360
which appear to be rising for some inexplicable reason.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.040
Look, if you live in Venice,

09:03.040 --> 09:07.120
just sell your house to the Innsmouth people and move away.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.160
It's fine.

09:08.160 --> 09:08.640
It's all...

09:09.360 --> 09:11.280
There's also the slightly deeper problem

09:11.280 --> 09:16.160
that Crowder's point about the Antarctic ice sheets isn't actually true either.

09:16.160 --> 09:21.040
The article that he posts up links to a study in the Journal of Glaciology entitled

09:21.040 --> 09:24.480
Mass Gains of the Antarctic Ice Sheet Exceed Losses.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.320
Note that it says

09:26.320 --> 09:28.320
Antarctic ice sheet

09:28.320 --> 09:31.920
because it's talking about the Antarctic ice sheet on its own

09:31.920 --> 09:34.080
and not the one in Greenland,

09:34.080 --> 09:35.440
which is melting.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.560
The study was focused on a specific part of East Antarctica,

09:38.560 --> 09:40.800
which most climatologists agree is growing.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.560
The question has been how much

09:42.560 --> 09:46.400
and whether this offsets the overall losses in West Antarctica,

09:46.400 --> 09:47.360
which is melting,

09:47.360 --> 09:50.720
and whether Antarctica overall is losing or gaining ice.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.040
Linked in the description is a really interesting breakdown

09:53.040 --> 09:55.280
by Shannon Hall for Scientific American.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.000
No, Paul.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.360
Not the blog section.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.880
An actual article exploring why other climatologists disagree

10:00.880 --> 10:02.720
with this particular study's findings.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.880
The study calculated the height of glaciers

10:04.880 --> 10:07.040
using methods which other scientists have argued

10:07.040 --> 10:09.120
is less accurate than other available ones,

10:09.120 --> 10:12.080
which presents a danger of the results having been thrown off.

10:12.080 --> 10:12.960
And furthermore,

10:12.960 --> 10:16.000
the study assumes that the height increase is all ice,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.960
whereas others would contend it is largely or partly snowfall,

10:18.960 --> 10:20.720
which is a whole lot less water.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.480
Other studies using different techniques

10:22.480 --> 10:24.320
conclude a much smaller increase,

10:24.320 --> 10:26.560
which means the net change in ice in Antarctica

10:26.560 --> 10:29.280
would be a loss and not a gain in ice.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.720
In other words, Crowder found basically the one study

10:32.720 --> 10:35.120
that contends that the mass gain

10:35.120 --> 10:37.920
exceeds the losses elsewhere in Antarctica,

10:37.920 --> 10:40.480
not net in terms of all the ice sheets,

10:40.480 --> 10:42.080
just in Antarctica,

10:42.080 --> 10:42.640
and went,

10:42.640 --> 10:43.600
oh, that's it, the one.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.280
That's the one proof.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.840
But tons of people disagree about this,

10:47.840 --> 10:49.600
and they have pretty good reasons to.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.680
I highly recommend you read the article for yourself,

10:51.680 --> 10:54.720
or, I mean, you could even read more than one thing

10:54.720 --> 10:56.320
before coming to a conclusion.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.480
I could spend an hour on this paper,

10:58.480 --> 11:00.240
and maybe one day I will.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.280
Let me know in the comments.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.520
But we're pressed for time,

11:03.520 --> 11:07.120
so I will point out that the main author of that paper

11:07.120 --> 11:08.320
is not just NASA.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.760
How about NASA?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.840
More than NASA work on things,

11:11.840 --> 11:13.440
individual people with names do.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.680
The main author of the paper, Jay Zwolle,

11:15.760 --> 11:17.840
was interviewed in the Scientific American,

11:17.840 --> 11:18.880
and he had this to say.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.200
I'm actually going to read this in voiceover

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
because I forgot to write it in my notes.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.400
"'When our paper came out,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.840
"'I was very careful to emphasize

11:27.840 --> 11:29.680
"'that this is in no way contradictory

11:29.680 --> 11:31.760
"'to the findings of the IPCC report

11:31.760 --> 11:33.360
"'or conclusions that climate change

11:33.360 --> 11:36.080
"'is a serious problem that we need to do something about.'"

11:36.080 --> 11:40.160
Even if Zwolle's paper is 100% accurate,

11:40.160 --> 11:43.280
which many of his associates have reasonable reasons to say

11:43.280 --> 11:44.320
is not correct,

11:44.320 --> 11:48.320
but even if we're still net losing far more ice

11:48.320 --> 11:49.520
through the other sheets,

11:50.240 --> 11:52.960
and the author of the paper believes

11:52.960 --> 11:55.440
that climate change is in fact happening,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.720
he just thinks it hasn't started happening in Antarctica yet,

11:59.280 --> 12:01.600
and that actually does make some sense.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.840
The last thing to start melting

12:03.840 --> 12:06.720
would be the coldest place in the world, right?

12:06.720 --> 12:07.840
I just realized that I don't know

12:07.840 --> 12:10.000
if it's actually the coldest place.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.840
Pretend I said one of the most coldest places.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.800
Oh, I'm gonna weasel my way out of all of my mistakes.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.680
Oh, I learned it from watching you, Stephen!

12:19.680 --> 12:22.080
Crowder's website is just full of this shit.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.240
The website is largely very short articles

12:24.240 --> 12:27.520
about how AOC is a demon or healthcare is communism

12:27.520 --> 12:29.040
or women's bodily autonomy

12:29.040 --> 12:30.880
is basically the Boxer Rebellion,

12:30.880 --> 12:33.360
usually ending in links to whatever video he did lately

12:33.360 --> 12:35.600
that's tangentially related to the subject.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.320
The articles themselves are authored by the site's editor,

12:38.320 --> 12:39.760
Courtney Kirchhoff.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.120
I hope it's not Kirchhoff.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.600
I could check how to pronounce her name.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.600
You know, do basic research,

12:45.600 --> 12:47.200
but I feel in the spirit of things

12:47.200 --> 12:48.720
I should just not fucking bother.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.480
One particular article that interests me

12:50.480 --> 12:52.240
is this one from March this year.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.080
Climate change fail!

12:54.080 --> 12:56.240
Melting glacier is growing again!

12:56.240 --> 12:58.000
The article is the usual waffle

12:58.000 --> 12:59.840
about how everything's always changing

12:59.840 --> 13:02.480
and therefore climate change isn't a threat or something,

13:02.480 --> 13:03.920
but the point it's dancing around

13:03.920 --> 13:06.720
is that a glacier that has been melting in the past

13:06.720 --> 13:08.320
is currently growing.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.840
Then there's another couple paragraphs

13:09.840 --> 13:11.360
of needless editorializing

13:11.360 --> 13:12.880
about how this proves there's nothing wrong

13:12.880 --> 13:13.760
with the climate,

13:13.760 --> 13:15.920
claiming that the melting was caused by human action

13:15.920 --> 13:18.240
is wrong because it's not melting anymore,

13:18.240 --> 13:20.640
weird pontificating about big government

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
wanting to control people's lives,

13:22.640 --> 13:24.720
and a gif from Zoolander.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.560
In other words, it's the most educated piece

13:26.560 --> 13:29.120
of conservative journalism I've seen all year.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.240
Hey, it's Bomberguy.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.360
HBomberguy here.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.760
Two things about this interest me.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.760
Firstly, I just want to point out

13:35.760 --> 13:37.840
that there's no mention of Greenland,

13:37.840 --> 13:41.600
uh, in Crowder's website or in his videos at all

13:41.680 --> 13:44.400
until the exact instant they think

13:44.400 --> 13:46.080
they can find a mention of it

13:46.080 --> 13:48.080
that proves what they think is happening.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.920
Secondly, even though they think

13:49.920 --> 13:51.680
they've finally found proof

13:51.680 --> 13:53.120
that things are better in Greenland,

13:53.760 --> 13:57.040
it's still just thinly disguised bullshit.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.560
The problem is the impression

13:58.560 --> 14:00.640
that Crowder and his website want to give.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.200
Here's a graph of the mass of Greenland's ice sheets

14:03.200 --> 14:05.920
from late 2016 to January 2017.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.420
See?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.240
Just like she said.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.440
It's just a natural, airborne flow

14:11.520 --> 14:14.400
Sometimes ice melts, but it comes back.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.600
See?

14:15.600 --> 14:18.240
It's almost gained back all of the ice

14:18.240 --> 14:20.160
that it melted in the same time.

14:20.960 --> 14:21.760
It's fine.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.320
But that's a weirdly specific span of time

14:24.320 --> 14:26.080
for someone to talk about, isn't it?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.560
Why would they just show you that?

14:29.680 --> 14:31.680
I mean, time goes back a little bit further

14:31.680 --> 14:32.640
than that, doesn't it?

14:33.360 --> 14:35.280
Let's zoom out a little bit further to, say...

14:36.720 --> 14:37.760
2002.

14:41.840 --> 14:47.040
Oh, I forgot!

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
These people are fucking liars!

14:49.040 --> 14:50.400
Ice sheets regaining mass

14:50.400 --> 14:51.920
in the colder parts of the year

14:51.920 --> 14:53.760
isn't unexpected and is, in fact,

14:53.760 --> 14:54.960
part of the process.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.920
Unfortunately, not all the melted ice comes back.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.160
The news piece is about one glacier

15:00.160 --> 15:01.680
doing better than expected,

15:01.680 --> 15:04.720
but this doesn't offset the clear general trend.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.640
If you were to draw a line here

15:06.640 --> 15:08.320
and pretend you'd found evidence

15:08.320 --> 15:09.600
the sheets were growing back

15:09.600 --> 15:11.280
as fast as they'd been melting,

15:11.280 --> 15:12.800
you would be doing a lie.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.960
Courtney is doing a version of that

15:14.960 --> 15:17.200
while also pretending one glacier

15:17.200 --> 15:18.560
disproves a wider trend

15:18.560 --> 15:20.400
that's been documented for decades.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.560
The glacier is growing about as quickly

15:22.560 --> 15:23.520
as it was shrinking.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.680
Oh, my God.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.600
The word about is doing some

15:27.600 --> 15:30.000
fucking legwork there, isn't it, Courtney?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.840
Every single time it's documented

15:31.840 --> 15:33.840
that an ice sheet or a glacier

15:33.840 --> 15:35.680
actually gains in size,

15:35.680 --> 15:37.920
there's always a conservative or some blogger

15:37.920 --> 15:39.120
willing to point at it and go,

15:39.120 --> 15:41.840
look, that proves there's not a problem.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.440
Look at this and only this.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.800
The science was lies.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.200
When the point isn't that sometimes

15:49.200 --> 15:51.360
there's more ice than there was before

15:51.360 --> 15:53.360
or sometimes some of it comes back.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.160
The point is that, on the whole,

15:57.120 --> 15:58.160
there's less of it.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.720
We're losing more than we're gaining.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.280
One glacier is not an entire ice sheet.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.840
It's not unexpected that ice sheets grow

16:05.840 --> 16:08.400
and the clock on how big ice sheets used to be

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
didn't start six months ago.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.080
If everything's proceeding as normal,

16:12.080 --> 16:14.640
where did all this fucking water come from, Courtney?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.400
So, here's the thing.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.800
Let's think about this now.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.240
Crowder was wrong for a variety of reasons,

16:22.960 --> 16:24.640
one of which was so simple

16:25.280 --> 16:27.520
that all you had to do was point out

16:28.080 --> 16:30.560
that there's more than one ice sheet.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.800
The one on his website is debunked

16:32.800 --> 16:35.200
by zooming out on a graph.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.080
Nothing I've pointed out here is special or unique.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.560
Like I said, this stuff is obvious to anyone

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
who's willing to read a paper for themselves

16:42.560 --> 16:44.960
or do almost any kind of critical thinking

16:44.960 --> 16:46.000
or fact-checking.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.240
What I want to draw attention to here

16:48.240 --> 16:50.240
is this obviousness itself

16:50.240 --> 16:53.120
because if Crowder cares about science and facts

16:53.120 --> 16:56.000
and reason and truth, et cetera, et cetera,

16:56.000 --> 16:56.880
blah, blah, blah,

16:57.840 --> 17:00.000
how did Crowder miss this?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.360
I think it would be a mistake

17:01.360 --> 17:03.600
to interpret this as pure ignorance.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.040
A much better explanation

17:05.040 --> 17:06.400
is that Crowder's business model

17:06.400 --> 17:08.480
has nothing to do with finding the truth

17:08.480 --> 17:09.520
or rational discourse

17:09.520 --> 17:11.280
or raising anyone's consciousness.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.960
His business model is about serving

17:12.960 --> 17:14.880
a demographic of conservative people

17:14.880 --> 17:17.280
who already feel a certain way about the world

17:17.280 --> 17:20.160
and the product he's selling is ideology.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.720
Crowder's work isn't about having a real debate

17:22.720 --> 17:24.480
or debunking the science.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.760
It's making an audience

17:25.760 --> 17:27.920
that thinks climate change is fake

17:27.920 --> 17:30.640
feel like they have a good reason to believe that.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.560
Crowder's audience is people who want

17:32.560 --> 17:35.040
their pre-existing beliefs validated.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.960
They don't actually want the truth.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.160
They want to feel like

17:38.160 --> 17:40.880
what they already think is the truth

17:40.880 --> 17:42.560
and this, it turns out,

17:42.560 --> 17:44.400
is a profitable business model.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.000
Not just in terms of the ad revenue

17:46.000 --> 17:47.040
from the views you'll get

17:47.040 --> 17:48.160
when you're telling an audience

17:48.160 --> 17:49.440
what they want to be told

17:49.440 --> 17:51.920
and how smart they are for wanting to be told it

17:51.920 --> 17:53.840
but also in terms of merchandising.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.920
Crowder doesn't sell brain pills

17:55.920 --> 17:58.560
yet he sells a mug to drink them out of.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.920
You know what's genius as well?

17:59.920 --> 18:02.560
You can't actually just fucking buy the mug

18:02.560 --> 18:03.760
like on his store.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.280
No, his store's just, you know,

18:05.280 --> 18:07.840
the fucking shittest merch ever.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.640
We had to discount the socialism baby onesie.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.640
Our warehouse is full of onesies

18:12.640 --> 18:14.640
that no one would ever buy.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.680
If you want to get into Crowder's hashtag mug club,

18:17.680 --> 18:20.160
Crowder does a daily show for Blaze TV,

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
basically Netflix for conservatives,

18:22.160 --> 18:24.960
and they charge a subscription of $99 a year

18:24.960 --> 18:27.040
but if you do it through Crowder's website,

18:27.040 --> 18:28.560
they send you this mug.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.680
Made in China.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.800
So, the mug costs $99.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.240
You can't actually buy the mug.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.160
You cannot buy the mug.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.760
You-you have to s-s-$99.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.520
And this is the point, really.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.200
Crowder makes a decent living

18:43.200 --> 18:44.720
not having to do research

18:44.720 --> 18:46.320
and instead serving an audience

18:46.320 --> 18:48.080
a piping hot daily serving

18:48.080 --> 18:49.760
of confirmation of their beliefs

18:49.760 --> 18:51.360
which they eat up uncritically

18:51.360 --> 18:53.120
because the point isn't learning.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.760
It's reassurance that they were already right

18:55.760 --> 18:57.920
and then they all take a sip in unison

18:57.920 --> 19:00.960
from the most expensive utensil they'll ever own

19:00.960 --> 19:03.200
which they bought specifically to signal

19:03.200 --> 19:04.960
that they support Reason Man

19:04.960 --> 19:07.200
and taking back the media?

19:07.200 --> 19:08.880
Is Crowder just mad that Fox News

19:08.880 --> 19:10.160
dropped him from the network?

19:10.160 --> 19:11.840
Crowder's duplicitous falsehoods

19:11.840 --> 19:13.280
work specifically because

19:13.280 --> 19:15.120
the audience wants to believe them.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.400
Not because they're ignorant

19:16.400 --> 19:18.080
but because they want to be.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.440
Crowder's specific grift

19:19.440 --> 19:21.520
is in using the right power words,

19:21.520 --> 19:24.960
truth, logic, rationality, reason, science,

19:24.960 --> 19:26.880
to mask this deliberate ignorance

19:26.880 --> 19:29.360
in a technicolor dream coat of intellect.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.520
So the incredibly poor work in his videos

19:31.520 --> 19:34.000
is because they know these people will eat it up

19:34.000 --> 19:36.240
and trust that they did the research for them

19:36.240 --> 19:37.680
so they don't have to.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.360
The ignorance of the audience occurs

19:39.360 --> 19:41.200
because they're only ever fed this stuff

19:41.200 --> 19:43.440
by their favorite conservative news websites

19:43.440 --> 19:45.280
and YouTubers and influencers

19:45.280 --> 19:47.840
so they never have to stop and look at the real facts.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.520
They're convinced they are.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.200
They're just further down a chain

19:51.200 --> 19:54.560
designed to only feed them facts that they want.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.440
Once you're wired into the conservative echo chamber,

19:57.440 --> 19:59.760
follow conservative thinkers on Facebook

19:59.760 --> 20:02.080
and YouTube and Twitter

20:02.080 --> 20:04.400
and read their news websites

20:04.400 --> 20:08.160
and buy their mugs and pills and books,

20:08.160 --> 20:10.000
you'll only ever come into contact

20:10.000 --> 20:11.920
with facts and information

20:11.920 --> 20:14.240
that happens to confirm your worldview.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.280
And we can see here just how easy it is to take

20:17.280 --> 20:20.880
a very specific thing that seems to confirm it,

20:20.880 --> 20:24.560
abstract away any inconvenient truths,

20:24.560 --> 20:26.000
and then present it as proof

20:26.080 --> 20:28.080
that you were already right

20:28.080 --> 20:30.960
and very smart and rational for believing it, too.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.160
The work is shoddy,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.400
and the holes are poorly wallpapered over

20:34.400 --> 20:36.240
with scaremongering about the dangers

20:36.240 --> 20:38.640
of big government Mino-like,

20:38.640 --> 20:41.520
not because they're genuinely trying to convince outsiders

20:41.520 --> 20:43.120
to change their minds.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.200
It's to try and protect the insiders

20:45.200 --> 20:47.280
from having to change their minds.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.080
If John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

20:50.080 --> 20:52.240
are Earth's climate change archangels,

20:52.240 --> 20:55.280
then just let the motherfucker burn.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.320
Ah, finally, someone partaking in rational discourse.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.320
These people need to be taken seriously.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.880
They have to invent a world

21:02.880 --> 21:06.480
where the problems that conservatism couldn't solve

21:06.480 --> 21:08.400
simply aren't really there.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.000
And frankly, I support this way of thinking.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.920
I would hate to have to live in the same world as horses,

21:15.920 --> 21:21.760
weird, smug little pricks with their eyes and teeth,

21:21.760 --> 21:23.440
but I've done some research,

21:23.440 --> 21:26.720
and it turns out that horses don't exist!

21:26.720 --> 21:28.720

I can see why the climatologists I know try not to bring the topic up too much in conversation.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.720
It's just depressing, especially if you agree with them, isn't it?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.880
Thinking about the scope of the problem?

22:02.880 --> 22:06.480
A lot of sweeping changes will have to be made very quickly on a large scale,

22:06.480 --> 22:10.080
or we'll be stuck in an uphill battle against the climate in the future.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.920
And given that we can't really personally bring about many of those changes on our own,

I'm cleaning it. I don't want to get it on my hands later if I pick it up again.

Linked in the description is a great video by Simon Clarke,

22:58.720 --> 23:01.520
a science YouTuber getting a PhD in climate physics,

23:01.520 --> 23:04.640
talking about what we ought to be looking into to deal with climate change.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.480
His suggestions take place on the level of what sources we use for power

23:08.480 --> 23:12.800
and changes in legislation of businesses whose actions directly affect the climate.

23:12.800 --> 23:18.160
I think this is important to recognize because I find a lot of people tend to embrace more personal solutions,

23:18.160 --> 23:22.480
like driving a more efficient car or using public transport or going vegan and so on.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.200
And it has to be acknowledged that these personal choices

23:25.200 --> 23:28.320
aren't the primary driver of climate problems in the first place.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.760
The wider policies are.

23:29.760 --> 23:34.800
It's very easy to give in to the idea that the solution lies in you reducing your personal emissions

23:34.800 --> 23:38.800
to create a sense of control and doing your part for this big and scary thing.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.080
But that effort maybe ought to be spent fighting to get the big things done,

23:42.080 --> 23:45.520
getting people thinking and providing support for meaningful changes.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.600
Basically, just don't make it personal.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.000
Climate change isn't your fault.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.720
It's the Koch brothers' fault.

Hey, Mortimer, what happened to my—

23:59.520 --> 24:02.240
You know who else has lots of information about the environment?

24:02.240 --> 24:04.480
This video's sponsor, CuriosityStream.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.080
They've recently expanded their library and there's more than 2,400 titles there now,

24:08.080 --> 24:09.920
including Climate, A Few Degrees Less,

24:09.920 --> 24:13.600
which breaks down the carbon cost of many key industries and what can be done to reduce them,

24:13.600 --> 24:16.960
and outlines the efforts of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project,

24:16.960 --> 24:20.240
a global consortium whose goal is to prevent future climate crisis.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.200
Access to CuriosityStream starts at $2.99 a month,

24:23.200 --> 24:26.800
which is less than a jar of Nutella will cost you and significantly better for your health.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.760
But if you sign up at curiositystream.com slash hbomberguy

There's literally two empty eggshells from some soft-boiled eggs

24:47.280 --> 24:50.640
I had, like, two days ago just sitting on my desk directly under my mic.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.680
Like, seriously, listen.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.760
I just broke an eggshell in my hand that's just there on my desk.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.260
So...

24:57.680 --> 24:59.520
Look, there's some good documentaries out—

24:59.520 --> 25:01.120
I need to go wash my dishes. I'm sorry.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.840
Speaking of being a morally compromised corporate shill,

25:03.840 --> 25:05.520
it's time to talk about Patrick Moore.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.240
Patrick Moore is a Canadian activist and environmentalist.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.520
Moore was the leader of Greenpeace Canada for about nine years.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.760
Moore is also in the Climate Denial Game,

25:15.760 --> 25:18.480
but he's playing it on Nightmare Mode.

25:18.480 --> 25:23.760
His specific stance is that carbon dioxide levels are affected by humans,

25:23.760 --> 25:27.040
but that an increase in CO2 is actually great!

25:27.040 --> 25:30.080
CO2 is what plants crave, after all!

25:30.080 --> 25:33.360
CO2 is the most important nutrient for all life on Earth.

25:33.360 --> 25:40.080
So we've been skipping along on top of this low point for CO2 for a long time now,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.880
and it's about time somebody did something about it.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.120
And so what if sea levels rise?

25:45.120 --> 25:47.680
Don't you know that humans are mostly water?

25:47.680 --> 25:50.000
We need it to live! It's good for us!

25:50.000 --> 25:51.360
Drink up, fucker!

25:53.440 --> 25:54.960
It's like Carlin said,

25:56.160 --> 26:00.240
the reason people came into existence is because the Earth wants plastic.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.120
Oh my god, he's doing George Carlin, but not for a joke.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.480
And maybe the reason people came into existence

26:06.480 --> 26:10.160
is because the atmosphere wants a little more carbon dioxide for the plants.

26:12.080 --> 26:12.640
Who knows?

26:13.440 --> 26:15.760
If only there were people whose job was to find out.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.760
Oh, you think those people are paid shills

26:17.760 --> 26:20.720
who are just pretending it might be caused by humans for money?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.880
This is Nassau at its worst.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.160
They do good things too,

26:24.160 --> 26:28.160
but they also collect over a billion dollars in climate change research money

26:28.160 --> 26:30.640
from the federal government in the United States.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.680
And they do this.

26:32.720 --> 26:37.120
CO2 controls Earth's temperature to keep getting that funding.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.560
Here he is complaining about a comedy sketch Bill Nye did lately

26:40.560 --> 26:43.760
on the basis that he's being so mean about CO2,

26:43.760 --> 26:46.480
he's demonizing it and hurting its fee-wings.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.320
Has anyone noticed the fire extinguisher on the table as the Earth burns?

26:50.320 --> 26:53.120
Many fire extinguishers are filled with CO2.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.400
The science guy could have put the fire out with carbon dioxide,

26:56.400 --> 27:00.960
which he wrongly demonizes as the cause of the fire.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.800
Um, I hate to break it to you, Mr. Moore,

27:03.360 --> 27:06.880
but Bill Nye was employing an experimental technique

27:06.880 --> 27:10.800
some people might not have heard of before called a visual metaphor.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.760
I'm not sure if people have noticed,

27:13.760 --> 27:17.120
but this isn't actually literally happening to the planet.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.440
The Earth isn't actually on fire.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.880
What's actually happening is CO2 is contributing to trapping more heat in the atmosphere,

27:24.880 --> 27:26.160
causing a warming effect.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.720
Which is tough to represent visually.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.560
When a fire extinguisher is used,

27:30.560 --> 27:35.600
the CO2 doesn't actually react with the fire directly to stop it from being fire.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.800
It actually displaces the oxygen that keeps the fire going,

27:38.800 --> 27:40.400
which helps extinguish it,

27:40.400 --> 27:43.600
with the secondary effect that the CO2 in the pressurized container

27:43.600 --> 27:45.120
is colder than room temperature,

27:45.120 --> 27:46.240
and therefore, the...

27:47.040 --> 27:49.760
CO2 is not a magic turn-fire-off gas!

27:50.960 --> 27:55.040
Having more in the atmosphere doesn't mean fires will go out easier.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.000
God damn it!

27:56.560 --> 27:59.920
You're wrong, H-bomber lie.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.520
You can't have too much of something if it's good for you.

28:03.520 --> 28:08.720
Now watch as I consume enough brain force to surpass even Ben Shapiro's power.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.800
No! Reasonablist bear!

28:10.800 --> 28:11.440
Don't!

28:11.440 --> 28:14.880
Your body can't take that much alertness and free thinking!

28:14.880 --> 28:17.520
At the end of the clip, Bill tries to blow the fire out,

28:17.520 --> 28:21.520
but did you know that breath also contains carbon dioxide?

28:21.520 --> 28:23.360
Checkmate, globe heads!

28:23.360 --> 28:24.240
I just proved...

28:26.000 --> 28:29.360
Oh, no!

28:30.080 --> 28:32.640
He died from having too much IQ!

28:34.080 --> 28:34.960
Rest in peace.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.760
If you didn't like that character, he's dead.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.720
He's gone now.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.720
Since quitting Greenpeace over...

28:40.720 --> 28:42.640
differences in policy,

28:42.640 --> 28:46.320
and Greenpeace have done everything they can to distance themselves from him since he left,

28:46.320 --> 28:48.080
Moore has become a consultant for businesses

28:48.080 --> 28:50.800
that get a bad rap from environmental organizations.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.640
As a former hire up at Greenpeace,

28:52.640 --> 28:54.720
Moore's a great catch for these industries.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.080
It's a compelling narrative.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.240
Here's someone who really did care about the planet,

28:58.240 --> 29:00.960
but he's come out against the people who say we're being unethical

29:00.960 --> 29:02.640
and saying that actually we're good,

29:02.640 --> 29:03.920
so we must be!

29:03.920 --> 29:06.640
Steven Crowder's second and third most popular videos

29:06.640 --> 29:08.640
about the climate are interviews with Moore.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.400
He's also gone on PragerU as well to list off his regular talking points,

29:12.400 --> 29:14.640
but in an even more stilted manner.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.640
I think something's wrong with PragerU's teleprompter.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.320
This keeps happening when people go on.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.760
He's just a real get, you know?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.320
He's the guy! He's the guy from Greenpeace,

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
and he says global warming's not real!

29:24.320 --> 29:26.080
We got him! We just have to keep quoting him!

29:26.080 --> 29:27.040
It's like we're right!

29:27.040 --> 29:28.640
We don't have to check or anything!

29:28.640 --> 29:31.520
They don't drag this guy onto everything because he's right,

29:31.520 --> 29:32.560
because he's not.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.400
They drag him on because they can say

29:34.400 --> 29:37.840
Greenpeace founder debunks climate in their video titles

29:37.840 --> 29:40.240
and everyone who wants to believe this can go,

29:40.240 --> 29:41.760
oh, well, that sounds about right,

29:41.760 --> 29:44.720
and, you know, not actually check what he's saying or anything,

29:44.720 --> 29:46.400
which is all wrong.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.160
Basically everything he says about the climate

29:48.160 --> 29:49.840
can be debunked if you question it,

29:49.840 --> 29:52.320
but no one watching this is going to, are they?

29:52.320 --> 29:54.720
They think these people have already done it for them.

29:54.720 --> 29:58.080
Moore positions himself as the sensible environmentalist.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.080
You know, not like those senseless ones

30:00.080 --> 30:02.080
that accept the science and, for some reason,

30:02.080 --> 30:03.760
think we should do something about it.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.960
I suppose it is sensible, in one sense of the word,

30:06.960 --> 30:08.480
to take money from big companies

30:08.480 --> 30:10.400
to try to rehabilitate their image.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.960
I'm sure the Koch brothers pay very well.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
I hate to sound like I'm beating a dead hawk—

30:14.960 --> 30:16.400
uh, dog here.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.040
["crying"]

30:19.040 --> 30:21.200
But I wasn't joking when I said that.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.760
This talk here is at the Heartland Institute,

30:23.760 --> 30:25.920
a conservative and libertarian think tank

30:25.920 --> 30:27.520
dedicated mostly to opposing

30:27.520 --> 30:29.840
the scientific outlook on climate change.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.000
It receives a very large portion of its funding

30:32.000 --> 30:33.280
from the Koch Foundation,

30:33.280 --> 30:36.000
an organization founded and run by the Koch brothers,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.360
two incredibly wealthy ultra-billionaire oil barons

30:39.360 --> 30:41.440
who have spent literally decades

30:41.440 --> 30:43.280
spreading this kind of misinformation.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.040
It's almost as if this whole thing

30:45.040 --> 30:46.560
is just a bunch of rich people

30:46.560 --> 30:48.080
trying to hold on to their money

30:48.080 --> 30:49.920
by paying to spread lies.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.200
By the way, they're one of the main donors

30:51.200 --> 30:52.720
to PragerU and the Rubin Report.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.600
What a surprise.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.560
It's actually pretty clear

30:54.560 --> 30:56.880
why Moore's imagination immediately goes

30:56.880 --> 30:59.920
to being paid to support a scientific conclusion.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.400
After all, that is what he's doing.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.400
Patrick Moore's denialism is wrong,

31:04.400 --> 31:07.200
and obviously wrong because of course it is,

31:07.200 --> 31:11.360
and his corporate cheerleading is just immoral,

31:11.360 --> 31:14.560
but he goes one step further sometimes

31:14.560 --> 31:17.520
in a way that I find special.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.280
You see, with denialism

31:19.280 --> 31:22.880
and with general anti-science fakery,

31:22.880 --> 31:25.200
there's a line that you can't cross.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.920
There's a reason why a lot of these people say things like,

31:27.920 --> 31:31.760
oh, well, you know, I'm not an expert, but...

31:31.760 --> 31:34.880
So here's my take on the climate change issue.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.640
On the climate change issue,

31:36.640 --> 31:38.480
I'm not gonna pretend that I'm an expert

31:38.480 --> 31:40.000
in reading the studies.

31:40.000 --> 31:40.720
Don't worry, Ben.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.720
You didn't have to volunteer that information.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.000
It was already obvious.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.160
This tacit admission of potential ignorance

31:46.160 --> 31:47.760
is an important part of the trickery

31:47.760 --> 31:50.000
because if you claimed to actually know

31:50.000 --> 31:51.600
what you were talking about,

31:51.600 --> 31:54.560
it would become crystal clear you were deliberately lying

31:54.560 --> 31:57.280
when it turned out you were so obviously wrong,

31:57.280 --> 31:59.120
but if you say you're an amateur,

31:59.120 --> 32:00.720
there's deniability.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.720
If Shapiro says something wrong,

32:02.720 --> 32:05.200
well, like he said, he hadn't looked that hard into it,

32:05.200 --> 32:06.240
and he's not an expert,

32:06.240 --> 32:08.320
so for all you know, he wasn't lying.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.200
My purpose here is not at all to pretend to be a scientist

32:11.200 --> 32:14.800
but to get you, the viewer, to think about real science.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.800
I'm not pretending to be a scientist.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.880
I just want you to have a think about

32:18.880 --> 32:22.240
the one and only one piece of evidence

32:22.240 --> 32:23.920
I'm going to show you.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.560
With bullshit, even with ridiculous bullshit,

32:26.560 --> 32:29.040
even with obvious lies,

32:29.040 --> 32:30.000
there is a line.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.880
I'm establishing this because, in 2014,

32:32.880 --> 32:34.880
Patrick Moore tripped on his own dick

32:34.880 --> 32:36.400
and fell all the way through the line

32:36.400 --> 32:39.360
and onto a live rail and electrocuted himself.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.280
Metaphorically, of course.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.200
I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm referring to here.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.200
It's the thing Patrick Moore is known for

32:45.200 --> 32:46.800
more than anything now.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.960
I'm referring, of course,

32:48.960 --> 32:50.960
to the weed killer incident.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.240
Okay, so some background here.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.760
There's a product called Roundup

32:53.760 --> 32:55.520
which was originally produced by Monsanto

32:55.520 --> 32:57.280
but has later been acquired by Bayer.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.280
It's based on a chemical called glyphosate,

32:59.280 --> 33:01.600
a chemical Monsanto discovered and patented,

33:01.600 --> 33:04.080
and it's the most used herbicide in the United States

33:04.080 --> 33:05.440
and on the planet, for that matter.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.960
However, there is some evidence

33:06.960 --> 33:08.480
that Roundup causes cancer

33:08.480 --> 33:10.880
if you come into heavy, repeated contact with it.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.400
There isn't evidence, to my knowledge,

33:12.400 --> 33:15.360
that crops treated with it become dangerous to eat

33:15.360 --> 33:18.240
or that limited domestic use is dangerous in this regard,

33:18.240 --> 33:20.240
but farmers who use it in large amounts

33:20.240 --> 33:22.720
and other agricultural workers like groundskeepers

33:22.720 --> 33:24.960
have an increased likelihood to be diagnosed

33:24.960 --> 33:28.160
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of blood cancer.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.240
Roundup's current owners, Bayer,

33:30.240 --> 33:31.360
have recently been ordered

33:31.360 --> 33:33.520
to pay billions of dollars in damages

33:33.520 --> 33:35.360
after it was found Roundup had failed

33:35.360 --> 33:37.600
to inform customers of the potential risks

33:37.600 --> 33:39.040
of using their product.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.240
Over 300 more federal lawsuits have been filed,

33:42.240 --> 33:44.880
and Costco recently discontinued selling Roundup.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.040
It was also banned in France in January.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.200
While all of these allegations were happening,

33:49.200 --> 33:51.520
French journalist Paul Marrera asked Moore

33:51.520 --> 33:54.160
about the safety and potential risks of glyphosate,

33:54.160 --> 33:58.160
and Moore, in an attempt to defend the herbicide, said this.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.360
-"Do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina

34:01.360 --> 34:03.200
is causing increases in cancer.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.000
You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you."

34:06.000 --> 34:09.920
Now, obviously you shouldn't drink weed killer.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.160
This was either a mistake or a lie,

34:12.160 --> 34:13.520
but Marrera had a sense of humor

34:13.520 --> 34:15.600
and asked him if he would like to drink some.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.840
-"You want to drink some? We have some here."

34:17.840 --> 34:19.440
-"I'd be happy to, actually."

34:19.440 --> 34:21.040
But then...click!

34:21.040 --> 34:22.640
You can see it in his eyes.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.800
You can see him realize he's taken the lie

34:24.800 --> 34:27.920
to support the big corporation a bit too far,

34:27.920 --> 34:31.360
and he just said he'd be happy to drink weed killer.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.360
What follows is, I feel,

34:33.360 --> 34:35.120
one of the most informative clips

34:35.120 --> 34:39.120
about the ideology that underpins denialism in history.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.240
-"I'd be happy to, actually. Not really, but..."

34:42.240 --> 34:43.920
-"Not really?" -"I know it wouldn't hurt me."

34:43.920 --> 34:46.160
-"If you say so. I have some glyphosate."

34:46.160 --> 34:47.440
-"No, no, I'm not stupid."

34:47.440 --> 34:48.880
-"Ah, okay, so you..."

34:48.880 --> 34:50.640
-"No, but I know that..." -"So it's dangerous, right?"

34:50.640 --> 34:54.320
-"No, people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly."

34:54.320 --> 34:57.440
-"Tell the truth." -"It's not dangerous to humans. No, it's not."

34:57.440 --> 34:59.360
-"So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?"

34:59.360 --> 35:01.040
-"No, I'm not an idiot."

35:01.040 --> 35:04.160
This is a funny clip, and it was shared widely when it happened.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.800
Although Moore is often credited as a Monsanto lobbyist,

35:06.800 --> 35:07.840
which isn't true.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.600
A Monsanto spokesperson denies him ever having been a paid lobbyist,

35:11.600 --> 35:13.760
but his cheerleading for a big company

35:13.760 --> 35:15.760
and his being mistaken for a lobbyist

35:15.760 --> 35:18.400
is unsurprising when, in the almost 30 years

35:18.400 --> 35:19.760
since he left Greenpeace,

35:19.760 --> 35:22.880
he makes his living lobbying for companies like Monsanto

35:22.880 --> 35:25.360
and leveraging his former Greenpeace status.

35:25.360 --> 35:28.960
I mean, he named his company Green Spirit for Sobeck's sake,

35:28.960 --> 35:31.200
but this clip makes it clearer than anywhere else

35:31.200 --> 35:33.760
that beneath the veneer of just being skeptical

35:33.760 --> 35:35.680
of the scientists and their agendas

35:35.760 --> 35:38.320
lies people whose job is not at all

35:38.320 --> 35:40.800
related to finding or sharing the truth.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.400
Moore realized he'd fucked up

35:42.400 --> 35:44.240
and immediately fled the interview.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.560
Think about the disconnect as he flicked

35:46.560 --> 35:48.960
between his defense of a company's product,

35:48.960 --> 35:51.840
claiming it was safe to drink and he'd be happy to,

35:51.840 --> 35:53.360
and his rational brain,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.600
the brain that actually knows the truth,

35:55.600 --> 35:57.200
his understanding that drinking it

35:57.200 --> 35:58.720
might actually be really bad

35:58.720 --> 36:00.320
and he shouldn't take that risk.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.800
But he accidentally took that extra step,

36:02.800 --> 36:04.160
said he would be happy to,

36:04.240 --> 36:07.200
and now has to argue that he would love to drink some,

36:07.200 --> 36:09.280
but he won't because he's not stupid.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.640
Climate denialism isn't just a bunch of people who are wrong.

36:12.640 --> 36:16.480
It's a bunch of people being paid to be wrong on purpose,

36:16.480 --> 36:18.960
to deliberately spread doubt of the truth,

36:18.960 --> 36:22.960
mislead the people who are honestly trying to be skeptical,

36:22.960 --> 36:24.960
and confirm the beliefs of the ignorant

36:24.960 --> 36:26.800
who want to pretend they're skeptical,

36:26.800 --> 36:29.200
and ultimately this contributes to perpetuating

36:29.200 --> 36:31.520
the profits of a few rich individuals

36:31.520 --> 36:34.240
who do not want to be made to reduce their profits

36:34.240 --> 36:36.560
or risk being held accountable for the effect

36:36.560 --> 36:39.200
their profiteering is having on the world we live on

36:39.200 --> 36:41.520
at the expense of that world.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.560
To pretend that there is a real, legitimate,

36:44.560 --> 36:46.560
non-astroturfed debate

36:46.560 --> 36:48.960
about whether climate change is caused by humans

36:48.960 --> 36:50.800
and represents a potential threat

36:50.800 --> 36:54.720
is to give into propaganda from people who are lying

36:54.720 --> 36:58.480
and know they're lying and are so used to lying

36:58.480 --> 37:01.280
that they will tell you it's safe to drink a weed killer

37:01.280 --> 37:04.480
that might be giving the farmers who work with it cancer.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.320
They will tell you that being alarmed

37:06.320 --> 37:10.160
about a credible threat to humanity's future

37:10.160 --> 37:11.920
makes you an alarmist.

37:11.920 --> 37:15.200
They will lie to your fucking face

37:15.200 --> 37:17.680
while telling you they're the true warriors

37:17.680 --> 37:19.280
of science and logic.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.680
Something can still be done about the climate.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.880
It simply requires dispelling these corporate lies,

37:24.880 --> 37:27.200
seeing past the people selling you the chance

37:27.200 --> 37:29.440
to pretend you know better than scientists,

37:29.440 --> 37:32.000
agitating for real political change,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.600
and advocating for a culture that actually accepts science,

37:35.600 --> 37:38.480
actually employs reason and skepticism,

37:38.480 --> 37:40.800
and doesn't just pretend they're magic words

37:40.800 --> 37:43.200
that can be used to make you sound clever.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.760
Almost everyone thinks science and facts

37:45.760 --> 37:48.720
and logic and truth are great.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.480
We all agree that those words are lovely

37:50.480 --> 37:52.320
and mean good things.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.720
The problem is a lot of people set out

37:54.720 --> 37:57.440
to prove those things are on their side

37:57.440 --> 38:00.000
instead of following those things where they lead.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.240
It's very easy to be misled by rhetoric

38:02.240 --> 38:05.120
into thinking that one idea is more reasonable than another,

38:05.120 --> 38:06.880
and it's even easier to find someone

38:06.880 --> 38:09.520
who's willing to tell you that what you think right now

38:09.520 --> 38:11.680
is already the reasonable thing.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.920
That doesn't make you actually right, though.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.840
I'm not a very smart person,

38:15.840 --> 38:18.720
and this isn't a self-deprecating joke I'm doing here.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.400
Everyone who thinks Dark Souls 2 is bad

38:20.400 --> 38:21.760
can attest to this already.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.520
I remember once I went to mail a letter

38:23.520 --> 38:25.280
and accidentally put the sunglasses

38:25.280 --> 38:27.200
in my other hand into the mailbox,

38:27.200 --> 38:29.680
and I just tried to quietly erase the memory

38:29.680 --> 38:33.440
of watching the sunglasses fade out of view

38:33.440 --> 38:34.800
and then drop from my hands

38:34.800 --> 38:37.920
as at the very last moment my brain went,

38:37.920 --> 38:38.560
hang on.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.040
I'm saying this because while humans can be very smart

38:41.040 --> 38:42.560
about some things in specific,

38:42.560 --> 38:45.600
sometimes humans are, in general,

38:45.600 --> 38:47.200
very bad about a lot of things.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.600
It's very easy to look at a horizon and say,

38:49.600 --> 38:52.080
well, it looks flat to me,

38:52.080 --> 38:54.160
or to discount the work of scientists

38:54.160 --> 38:56.880
because, well, it just looks a different way to you.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.720
And it's very easy to dismiss anyone

38:58.720 --> 39:01.280
who might be an authority on an issue as, well,

39:01.280 --> 39:02.640
an argument from authority.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.840
After all, a PhD is just a piece of paper.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.800
It doesn't necessarily mean what that person says is right,

39:08.800 --> 39:11.040
and you would be right to assume that,

39:11.040 --> 39:13.920
but I also think it's wrong to use that

39:13.920 --> 39:16.640
as a deliberate strategy to avoid dealing with the fact

39:16.640 --> 39:19.360
that sometimes people do know better than you

39:19.360 --> 39:20.640
about complex issues.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.480
If you find it easy to discount

39:22.480 --> 39:24.640
hundreds of people's life's work

39:24.640 --> 39:26.400
because you reckon you know better

39:26.400 --> 39:28.880
based on one paper you've read,

39:28.880 --> 39:31.520
then you might as well have put your brain in the mailbox.

39:31.520 --> 39:32.880
So it turns out there's an advantage

39:32.880 --> 39:34.480
to being as rubbish as me.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.240
It means you have to put effort into learning things

39:36.240 --> 39:38.480
and develop a respect and appreciation

39:38.480 --> 39:40.320
for the people who put so much time

39:40.320 --> 39:41.360
into learning something

39:41.360 --> 39:44.800
and an understanding that maybe they do know more than you.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.320
When I find myself disagreeing

39:46.320 --> 39:48.400
with the conclusions of a scientist,

39:48.400 --> 39:50.960
I ask myself what they might know that I don't

39:50.960 --> 39:53.520
and go look for that and see if that changes my mind.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.640
And when I find a scientist that I happen to find agreeable,

39:56.640 --> 39:57.680
I immediately think,

39:57.680 --> 40:00.720
well, if they think like I do, then, well, something's up.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.240
Let's see what the others have to say

40:02.240 --> 40:04.080
and why they might think they're wrong

40:04.080 --> 40:05.280
and what their reasons are.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.360
The true test of skepticism

40:07.360 --> 40:10.560
isn't in finding ways to debunk your opponents

40:10.560 --> 40:12.720
or change anyone else's mind.

40:12.720 --> 40:16.400
It's in finding ways to understand when you are wrong

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
and learn to change your mind.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.160
Sometimes that's easier than others.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.840
For example, in this instance,

40:21.840 --> 40:24.240
a lot of people who currently deny climate change

40:24.800 --> 40:27.440
can freely admit that they were lied to.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.480
They were misled by people who only showed them facts

40:30.480 --> 40:32.160
that appeared to confirm their beliefs.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.760
They hadn't really thought that hard about it.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.120
In fact, their thinking had basically been done for them.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.520
They'd given over the thinking to someone else

40:41.520 --> 40:43.360
who it turned out they couldn't trust

40:43.360 --> 40:45.440
and now they can think for themselves

40:45.440 --> 40:47.360
and maybe come to different conclusions.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.400
I changed a lot the day I realized

40:50.400 --> 40:52.960
that there are people out there who make a living

40:52.960 --> 40:56.400
making you feel good for believing what they tell you

40:57.280 --> 41:01.840
and, frankly, it gives me hope that that happened to me

41:02.800 --> 41:05.200
because I know I'm a foolish person

41:05.760 --> 41:07.520
and if I can learn and grow and change

41:07.520 --> 41:08.560
then there's hope for all of us

41:09.600 --> 41:11.200
and I believe that even you,

41:11.840 --> 41:14.400
yes, you, can one day come to accept the truth

41:15.040 --> 41:16.720
that horses don't exist.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.880
That's what this video is about.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.440
Goodbye.
