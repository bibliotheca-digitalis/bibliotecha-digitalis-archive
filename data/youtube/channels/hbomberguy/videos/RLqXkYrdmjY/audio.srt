00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This vid...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Pfft.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Oh, you like your peanut butter, don't you, Mortimer?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
Oh, he's a good boy, aww.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,200
Hey, friends! Did you know that climate change is definitely real and definitely affected by human action?

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,320
I had to ask because, well, some people deny that that's happening, and this video is about them.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, I'm not here to pretend that there's a real debate in science about whether CO2 affects global temperatures,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or whether humans have a hand in it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480
The science is settled and the deniers are wrong.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,960
Oh, yeah, call them deniers to make them look bad.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
That's a classic straw man argument.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,880
They're not denying climate change, they're just skeptical that it's happening.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,520
See, it's actually very smart when you put it that way.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,160
And look how this degenerate refuses to engage in reasonable debate with people who disagree with him.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
That's not rational at all.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,160
How can the issue be settled if you haven't debunked your opponent's points?

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,440
Look, mate, I hate to be dogmatic, but-

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,560
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,840
But I think any reasonable analysis of climate deniers has to contend with the extreme deficit of actual facts

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,800
on the side of people who claim to be the ones who know the facts better than the actual researchers.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,560
When someone specifically positions themselves as pro-science and fetishizes the idea of reason,

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
the fact they're being unreasonable is something that needs to be brought up.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
We're gonna get into it, but if someone's evidence is so poor that even me,

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,720
a gaming YouTuber who got peanut butter in his ear when he was setting up the first shot for this video,

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
can see the holes in it, then something's really gone wrong here.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,440
So in this video, we're gonna look at some prominent climate deniers,

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,800
what they have to say, why what they say is clearly wrong,

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,640
why they seem to believe it anyway,

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,120
how people get to be climate deniers,

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,560
and what we can do to have- make there be less of the-

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
...

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,520
Nailed it!

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,640
I suppose one thing you could do is just let the ice sheets melt.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
I mean, the problem would kind of go away if most of them drowned.

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
Ooh! Oh! I'm dying!

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
Oh, I guess I was wrong!

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,920
Oops!

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,720
...

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,880
...

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,320
Now, climate denialism doesn't come in just one flavor.

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,840
No, like ogres, the issue has layers.

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
And unlike ogres, climate deniers are not all-stars.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Although the ice they skate is getting pretty thin,

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
and the water's getting warm, so they might as well swim.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,520
Smash Mouth's all-star was about climate change.

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
CHANGE MY MIND!

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
Deniers range from claiming the climate isn't actually changing at all

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
to admitting that the climate changes but that humans don't have an effect

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,440
and it's probably just normal that things have got so warm lately.

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm sure it'll go back to normal soon.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,000
To claiming that CO2 doesn't really have an effect on the climate.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
To saying that even if it does, it's actually good for us since plants need CO2.

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,560
To saying it's real but it's not that bad and scientists are exaggerating.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
To saying, well, look, I'm confused.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
A lot of people are saying a lot of different things,

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,520
so I guess it's still up for debate and we shouldn't do anything.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,400
Ah, that's great.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
See, even cowards have a place in denialism.

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
If you haven't heard of Ben Shapiro,

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,960
then your YouTube recommendations bar is glitched out.

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,440
Shapiro is a conservative commentator who's very popular with people who already agree with him

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
and he's really good at winning debates with teenagers who haven't finished university

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
and don't have all the media training he has.

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
He was editor-at-large of Breitbart for four years

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
and he's written ten books about how it's the left's fault

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
that conservatism keeps making things worse for everyone.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
He's a true intellectual gymnast,

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
the kind that can write tweets decrying when the left talk about

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
how they're on the right side of history

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,800
and then publish an entire book called The Right Side of History.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,200
Here he is, dipping his webbed flippers into the pool of climate change

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,160
with his signature Shapiro intellect.

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
So let's say, let's say, for the sake of argument,

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,960
that all of the water levels around the world rise by, let's say, five feet

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,840
over the next hundred years.

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
Say ten feet by the next hundred years

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,520
and it puts all the low-lying areas on the coast underwater.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Right? Which, let's say all of that happens.

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,320
You think that people aren't going to just sell their homes and move?

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:22,960
Just one small problem.

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
Sell their houses to who, Ben?

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Fucking Aquaman!

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,120
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Sigh.

86
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
It was watching this talk by Shapiro that got me wanting to

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
look at and analyze climate denial in more detail

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,880
because this absolute genius-brained idea that

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,800
everyone affected by things like floods can just sell their homes

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
to people who would love to buy a flooding house, apparently,

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
and move somewhere else,

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
well, it begs a lot of questions about how these people think.

93
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
How have things reached a point where someone thinks they can get away

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
with saying something this ridiculous in front of an audience of people,

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
and how have things reached a point where some people in that audience

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
won't recognize it for the obvious, ignorant bullshit that it is?

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,640
This led me down a particular hole of discovery.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,480
I realized that climate deniers aren't just wrong.

99
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,520
They're obviously wrong in very clear ways,

100
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
and that makes the whole thing so much more interesting.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
How does this work if it's so paper-thin?

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,040
Take, for example, Stephen Crowder.

103
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,680
Stephen Crowder is a conservative political commentator,

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
and Wikipedia tells me he's a comedian,

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
which I'm glad they mentioned or I wouldn't have noticed.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,760
Crowder's YouTube channel is his special place

107
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,400
to wax lyrical about topical conservative issues.

108
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,880
He's a rational thinker who doesn't play by anyone's rules

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
and will follow truth wherever it leads,

110
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
although it always seems to lead to whatever he wanted to believe

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
in the first place.

112
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm sure it's just a coincidence that he never has to change his mind

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
about anything.

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,400
Crowder has a big beef with Bill Nye, as we've seen in the past,

115
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
but that's a byproduct of his more general climate denial.

116
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Of course, Crowder denies being a climate denier.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,320
Crowder positions himself as a climate realist

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,280
who acknowledges that the climate has changed and is changing.

119
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
It's just not changing in the way that all the scientists say it does.

120
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
In other words, he's denying the science

121
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
but in denial about denying the science.

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
His most popular video on the topic has almost two million views

123
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,200
and claims to debunk the top five climate change myths.

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,480
We'll get to his others later.

125
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,800
Regarding this one first, however, he's wrong.

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,040
This video and everything in it has been debunked

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,440
repeatedly and epically by many people online on the internet already,

128
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
so I'm not gonna really do that too much.

129
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,760
Okay, you've noticed it by now. There's no avoiding it.

130
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,920
Uh, when I was hitting the wall with the axe,

131
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
I got a little bit of debris on my mouth

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,600
and I didn't notice it for a couple takes.

133
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
Just try not to look at it and we'll all get through it together.

134
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,560
What I want to draw attention to here is how blatantly wrong it is

135
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
to anyone who's willing to do even a smidgen of research.

136
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
One of the myths he tries to debunk is that the ice sheets are melting.

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
Number two, you've heard this one everywhere.

138
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
The ice sheets are melting!

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,320
If the ice sheets were melting, it would cause an increase in sea levels

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,600
as all of the water in the ice makes its way into the oceans.

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,640
It would also increase CO2 levels because CO2 is stored in ice

142
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,320
and then escapes when it melts.

143
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
It would affect the albedo of the planet,

144
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
its ability to reflect, uh, the heat and light of the sun.

145
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
It wouldn't just make things worse on its own,

146
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
it would exacerbate the process by which things are getting worse.

147
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
But don't worry, Steven Crowder's done a picosecond of googling

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and he's decided that they're not melting.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
In fact, they're growing!

150
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,080
The Antarctic ice sheets are actually growing by billions of tons per year.

151
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,320
Does that come to me from climatechangedenialslashflatearthers.com?

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,840
No, how about NASA?

153
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
According to the new analysis of satellite data,

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,200
the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice per year

155
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
from 1992 to 2001.

156
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh, shit, he's using facts and logic!

157
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
Sound the alarms!

158
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
Battle stations!

159
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,200
Prepare for impact!

160
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
Actually, one question.

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,200
When you said ice sheets, that's a plural sound.

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,840
Could it be that there's another ice sheet, say, in Greenland,

163
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
where the opposite is true and it's melting really quickly

164
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,800
and maybe there's a net loss of ice?

165
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,640
I wonder what he'll say about it.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,520
He doesn't bring it up.

167
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:29,920
He doesn't.

168
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Just pretend Greenland doesn't exist.

169
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
According to the European Environmental Agency,

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,800
between the years of 2002 to 2011,

171
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,760
Greenland lost an average of 215 billion tons of ice per year.

172
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
Then in 2012, it lost 500 billion.

173
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,160
So if you do some quick maths there,

174
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,720
you'll probably notice that even if Antarctica is growing at the rate Crowder says it is,

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
which we'll get back to that later,

176
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,680
over 100 billion tons of ice per year is now water in our oceans,

177
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,360
which appear to be rising for some inexplicable reason.

178
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
Look, if you live in Venice,

179
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,120
just sell your house to the Innsmouth people and move away.

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
It's fine.

181
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,640
It's all...

182
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,280
There's also the slightly deeper problem

183
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,160
that Crowder's point about the Antarctic ice sheets isn't actually true either.

184
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,040
The article that he posts up links to a study in the Journal of Glaciology entitled

185
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,480
Mass Gains of the Antarctic Ice Sheet Exceed Losses.

186
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,320
Note that it says

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Antarctic ice sheet

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
because it's talking about the Antarctic ice sheet on its own

189
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
and not the one in Greenland,

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
which is melting.

191
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
The study was focused on a specific part of East Antarctica,

192
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
which most climatologists agree is growing.

193
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
The question has been how much

194
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,400
and whether this offsets the overall losses in West Antarctica,

195
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,360
which is melting,

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
and whether Antarctica overall is losing or gaining ice.

197
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
Linked in the description is a really interesting breakdown

198
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,280
by Shannon Hall for Scientific American.

199
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,000
No, Paul.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Not the blog section.

201
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,880
An actual article exploring why other climatologists disagree

202
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,720
with this particular study's findings.

203
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
The study calculated the height of glaciers

204
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,040
using methods which other scientists have argued

205
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,120
is less accurate than other available ones,

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,080
which presents a danger of the results having been thrown off.

207
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,960
And furthermore,

208
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,000
the study assumes that the height increase is all ice,

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,960
whereas others would contend it is largely or partly snowfall,

210
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,720
which is a whole lot less water.

211
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
Other studies using different techniques

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
conclude a much smaller increase,

213
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
which means the net change in ice in Antarctica

214
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,280
would be a loss and not a gain in ice.

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,720
In other words, Crowder found basically the one study

216
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
that contends that the mass gain

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,920
exceeds the losses elsewhere in Antarctica,

218
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,480
not net in terms of all the ice sheets,

219
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
just in Antarctica,

220
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,640
and went,

221
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
oh, that's it, the one.

222
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,280
That's the one proof.

223
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,840
But tons of people disagree about this,

224
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
and they have pretty good reasons to.

225
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
I highly recommend you read the article for yourself,

226
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
or, I mean, you could even read more than one thing

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
before coming to a conclusion.

228
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
I could spend an hour on this paper,

229
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
and maybe one day I will.

230
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,280
Let me know in the comments.

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
But we're pressed for time,

232
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,120
so I will point out that the main author of that paper

233
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,320
is not just NASA.

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
How about NASA?

235
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,840
More than NASA work on things,

236
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
individual people with names do.

237
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
The main author of the paper, Jay Zwolle,

238
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,840
was interviewed in the Scientific American,

239
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
and he had this to say.

240
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm actually going to read this in voiceover

241
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
because I forgot to write it in my notes.

242
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
"'When our paper came out,

243
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,840
"'I was very careful to emphasize

244
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,680
"'that this is in no way contradictory

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
"'to the findings of the IPCC report

246
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
"'or conclusions that climate change

247
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,080
"'is a serious problem that we need to do something about.'"

248
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,160
Even if Zwolle's paper is 100% accurate,

249
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,280
which many of his associates have reasonable reasons to say

250
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,320
is not correct,

251
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
but even if we're still net losing far more ice

252
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
through the other sheets,

253
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,960
and the author of the paper believes

254
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,440
that climate change is in fact happening,

255
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,720
he just thinks it hasn't started happening in Antarctica yet,

256
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,600
and that actually does make some sense.

257
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,840
The last thing to start melting

258
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,720
would be the coldest place in the world, right?

259
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,840
I just realized that I don't know

260
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,000
if it's actually the coldest place.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,840
Pretend I said one of the most coldest places.

262
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,800
Oh, I'm gonna weasel my way out of all of my mistakes.

263
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
Oh, I learned it from watching you, Stephen!

264
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,080
Crowder's website is just full of this shit.

265
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,240
The website is largely very short articles

266
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,520
about how AOC is a demon or healthcare is communism

267
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,040
or women's bodily autonomy

268
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
is basically the Boxer Rebellion,

269
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,360
usually ending in links to whatever video he did lately

270
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
that's tangentially related to the subject.

271
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,320
The articles themselves are authored by the site's editor,

272
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Courtney Kirchhoff.

273
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
I hope it's not Kirchhoff.

274
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
I could check how to pronounce her name.

275
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
You know, do basic research,

276
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
but I feel in the spirit of things

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
I should just not fucking bother.

278
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
One particular article that interests me

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
is this one from March this year.

280
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
Climate change fail!

281
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,240
Melting glacier is growing again!

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
The article is the usual waffle

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,840
about how everything's always changing

284
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,480
and therefore climate change isn't a threat or something,

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
but the point it's dancing around

286
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,720
is that a glacier that has been melting in the past

287
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
is currently growing.

288
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,840
Then there's another couple paragraphs

289
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,360
of needless editorializing

290
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,880
about how this proves there's nothing wrong

291
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,760
with the climate,

292
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,920
claiming that the melting was caused by human action

293
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,240
is wrong because it's not melting anymore,

294
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,640
weird pontificating about big government

295
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
wanting to control people's lives,

296
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,720
and a gif from Zoolander.

297
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
In other words, it's the most educated piece

298
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
of conservative journalism I've seen all year.

299
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Hey, it's Bomberguy.

300
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,360
HBomberguy here.

301
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
Two things about this interest me.

302
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Firstly, I just want to point out

303
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
that there's no mention of Greenland,

304
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,600
uh, in Crowder's website or in his videos at all

305
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,400
until the exact instant they think

306
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
they can find a mention of it

307
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
that proves what they think is happening.

308
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,920
Secondly, even though they think

309
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
they've finally found proof

310
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
that things are better in Greenland,

311
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,040
it's still just thinly disguised bullshit.

312
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
The problem is the impression

313
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,640
that Crowder and his website want to give.

314
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,200
Here's a graph of the mass of Greenland's ice sheets

315
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,920
from late 2016 to January 2017.

316
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,420
See?

317
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,240
Just like she said.

318
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
It's just a natural, airborne flow

319
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,400
Sometimes ice melts, but it comes back.

320
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,600
See?

321
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
It's almost gained back all of the ice

322
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
that it melted in the same time.

323
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
It's fine.

324
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
But that's a weirdly specific span of time

325
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
for someone to talk about, isn't it?

326
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,560
Why would they just show you that?

327
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
I mean, time goes back a little bit further

328
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,640
than that, doesn't it?

329
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,280
Let's zoom out a little bit further to, say...

330
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,760
2002.

331
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,040
Oh, I forgot!

332
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
These people are fucking liars!

333
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,400
Ice sheets regaining mass

334
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,920
in the colder parts of the year

335
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
isn't unexpected and is, in fact,

336
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,960
part of the process.

337
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,920
Unfortunately, not all the melted ice comes back.

338
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
The news piece is about one glacier

339
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
doing better than expected,

340
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,720
but this doesn't offset the clear general trend.

341
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
If you were to draw a line here

342
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
and pretend you'd found evidence

343
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
the sheets were growing back

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,280
as fast as they'd been melting,

345
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,800
you would be doing a lie.

346
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,960
Courtney is doing a version of that

347
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,200
while also pretending one glacier

348
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,560
disproves a wider trend

349
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,400
that's been documented for decades.

350
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,560
The glacier is growing about as quickly

351
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,520
as it was shrinking.

352
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
Oh, my God.

353
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
The word about is doing some

354
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
fucking legwork there, isn't it, Courtney?

355
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,840
Every single time it's documented

356
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
that an ice sheet or a glacier

357
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,680
actually gains in size,

358
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
there's always a conservative or some blogger

359
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
willing to point at it and go,

360
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,840
look, that proves there's not a problem.

361
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
Look at this and only this.

362
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
The science was lies.

363
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,200
When the point isn't that sometimes

364
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,360
there's more ice than there was before

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
or sometimes some of it comes back.

366
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,160
The point is that, on the whole,

367
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,160
there's less of it.

368
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
We're losing more than we're gaining.

369
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
One glacier is not an entire ice sheet.

370
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,840
It's not unexpected that ice sheets grow

371
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,400
and the clock on how big ice sheets used to be

372
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
didn't start six months ago.

373
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,080
If everything's proceeding as normal,

374
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,640
where did all this fucking water come from, Courtney?

375
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,400
So, here's the thing.

376
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,800
Let's think about this now.

377
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,240
Crowder was wrong for a variety of reasons,

378
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,640
one of which was so simple

379
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,520
that all you had to do was point out

380
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,560
that there's more than one ice sheet.

381
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
The one on his website is debunked

382
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
by zooming out on a graph.

383
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,080
Nothing I've pointed out here is special or unique.

384
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
Like I said, this stuff is obvious to anyone

385
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
who's willing to read a paper for themselves

386
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,960
or do almost any kind of critical thinking

387
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
or fact-checking.

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
What I want to draw attention to here

389
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
is this obviousness itself

390
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,120
because if Crowder cares about science and facts

391
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
and reason and truth, et cetera, et cetera,

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
blah, blah, blah,

393
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,000
how did Crowder miss this?

394
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
I think it would be a mistake

395
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,600
to interpret this as pure ignorance.

396
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,040
A much better explanation

397
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
is that Crowder's business model

398
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
has nothing to do with finding the truth

399
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,520
or rational discourse

400
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
or raising anyone's consciousness.

401
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,960
His business model is about serving

402
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,880
a demographic of conservative people

403
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
who already feel a certain way about the world

404
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,160
and the product he's selling is ideology.

405
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,720
Crowder's work isn't about having a real debate

406
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
or debunking the science.

407
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
It's making an audience

408
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,920
that thinks climate change is fake

409
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,640
feel like they have a good reason to believe that.

410
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,560
Crowder's audience is people who want

411
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,040
their pre-existing beliefs validated.

412
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,960
They don't actually want the truth.

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
They want to feel like

414
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,880
what they already think is the truth

415
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,560
and this, it turns out,

416
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,400
is a profitable business model.

417
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Not just in terms of the ad revenue

418
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,040
from the views you'll get

419
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
when you're telling an audience

420
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
what they want to be told

421
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,920
and how smart they are for wanting to be told it

422
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,840
but also in terms of merchandising.

423
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,920
Crowder doesn't sell brain pills

424
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,560
yet he sells a mug to drink them out of.

425
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,920
You know what's genius as well?

426
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,560
You can't actually just fucking buy the mug

427
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
like on his store.

428
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
No, his store's just, you know,

429
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
the fucking shittest merch ever.

430
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,640
We had to discount the socialism baby onesie.

431
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Our warehouse is full of onesies

432
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
that no one would ever buy.

433
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,680
If you want to get into Crowder's hashtag mug club,

434
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,160
Crowder does a daily show for Blaze TV,

435
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
basically Netflix for conservatives,

436
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
and they charge a subscription of $99 a year

437
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,040
but if you do it through Crowder's website,

438
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,560
they send you this mug.

439
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,680
Made in China.

440
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,800
So, the mug costs $99.

441
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,240
You can't actually buy the mug.

442
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,160
You cannot buy the mug.

443
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,760
You-you have to s-s-$99.

444
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
And this is the point, really.

445
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
Crowder makes a decent living

446
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,720
not having to do research

447
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
and instead serving an audience

448
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
a piping hot daily serving

449
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
of confirmation of their beliefs

450
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
which they eat up uncritically

451
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
because the point isn't learning.

452
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,760
It's reassurance that they were already right

453
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,920
and then they all take a sip in unison

454
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,960
from the most expensive utensil they'll ever own

455
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
which they bought specifically to signal

456
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
that they support Reason Man

457
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
and taking back the media?

458
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
Is Crowder just mad that Fox News

459
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,160
dropped him from the network?

460
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
Crowder's duplicitous falsehoods

461
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,280
work specifically because

462
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,120
the audience wants to believe them.

463
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,400
Not because they're ignorant

464
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
but because they want to be.

465
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,440
Crowder's specific grift

466
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
is in using the right power words,

467
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,960
truth, logic, rationality, reason, science,

468
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,880
to mask this deliberate ignorance

469
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
in a technicolor dream coat of intellect.

470
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,520
So the incredibly poor work in his videos

471
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,000
is because they know these people will eat it up

472
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
and trust that they did the research for them

473
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,680
so they don't have to.

474
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,360
The ignorance of the audience occurs

475
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
because they're only ever fed this stuff

476
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
by their favorite conservative news websites

477
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
and YouTubers and influencers

478
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
so they never have to stop and look at the real facts.

479
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
They're convinced they are.

480
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
They're just further down a chain

481
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,560
designed to only feed them facts that they want.

482
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,440
Once you're wired into the conservative echo chamber,

483
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
follow conservative thinkers on Facebook

484
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,080
and YouTube and Twitter

485
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,400
and read their news websites

486
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,160
and buy their mugs and pills and books,

487
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,000
you'll only ever come into contact

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
with facts and information

489
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,240
that happens to confirm your worldview.

490
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
And we can see here just how easy it is to take

491
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,880
a very specific thing that seems to confirm it,

492
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,560
abstract away any inconvenient truths,

493
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,000
and then present it as proof

494
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
that you were already right

495
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,960
and very smart and rational for believing it, too.

496
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
The work is shoddy,

497
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,400
and the holes are poorly wallpapered over

498
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,240
with scaremongering about the dangers

499
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,640
of big government Mino-like,

500
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,520
not because they're genuinely trying to convince outsiders

501
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,120
to change their minds.

502
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
It's to try and protect the insiders

503
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,280
from having to change their minds.

504
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,080
If John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

505
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
are Earth's climate change archangels,

506
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,280
then just let the motherfucker burn.

507
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
Ah, finally, someone partaking in rational discourse.

508
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
These people need to be taken seriously.

509
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,880
They have to invent a world

510
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,480
where the problems that conservatism couldn't solve

511
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
simply aren't really there.

512
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,000
And frankly, I support this way of thinking.

513
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,920
I would hate to have to live in the same world as horses,

514
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,760
weird, smug little pricks with their eyes and teeth,

515
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
but I've done some research,

516
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,720
and it turns out that horses don't exist!

517
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Yay!

518
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,600

Man, the scale of the problem is so big, isn't it?

524
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,520
I can see why the climatologists I know try not to bring the topic up too much in conversation.

525
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,720
It's just depressing, especially if you agree with them, isn't it?

526
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
Thinking about the scope of the problem?

527
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
A lot of sweeping changes will have to be made very quickly on a large scale,

528
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
or we'll be stuck in an uphill battle against the climate in the future.

529
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,920
And given that we can't really personally bring about many of those changes on our own,

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,320
what's really left to do on planet Earth other than wait to see what happens and

531
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
run out the clock eating Nutella straight out of the jar?

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:32,240
♪

533
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
Well, you could do that.

534
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
And maybe sometimes you should.

535
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,000
But Nutella is a sometimes food.

536
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,080
And there are some things you can do about climate change, if you'd like to try.

537
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,800
♪

538
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm cleaning it. I don't want to get it on my hands later if I pick it up again.

539
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,720
Linked in the description is a great video by Simon Clarke,

540
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,520
a science YouTuber getting a PhD in climate physics,

541
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
talking about what we ought to be looking into to deal with climate change.

542
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
His suggestions take place on the level of what sources we use for power

543
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,800
and changes in legislation of businesses whose actions directly affect the climate.

544
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,160
I think this is important to recognize because I find a lot of people tend to embrace more personal solutions,

545
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,480
like driving a more efficient car or using public transport or going vegan and so on.

546
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,200
And it has to be acknowledged that these personal choices

547
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,320
aren't the primary driver of climate problems in the first place.

548
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,760
The wider policies are.

549
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,800
It's very easy to give in to the idea that the solution lies in you reducing your personal emissions

550
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,800
to create a sense of control and doing your part for this big and scary thing.

551
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,080
But that effort maybe ought to be spent fighting to get the big things done,

552
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,520
getting people thinking and providing support for meaningful changes.

553
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
Basically, just don't make it personal.

554
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Climate change isn't your fault.

555
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,720
It's the Koch brothers' fault.

556
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
Hey, Mortimer, what happened to my—

557
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,520
MORTIMER NOOOOO—

558
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,240
You know who else has lots of information about the environment?

559
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
This video's sponsor, CuriosityStream.

560
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,080
They've recently expanded their library and there's more than 2,400 titles there now,

561
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,920
including Climate, A Few Degrees Less,

562
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,600
which breaks down the carbon cost of many key industries and what can be done to reduce them,

563
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
and outlines the efforts of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project,

564
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,240
a global consortium whose goal is to prevent future climate crisis.

565
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
Access to CuriosityStream starts at $2.99 a month,

566
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,800
which is less than a jar of Nutella will cost you and significantly better for your health.

567
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,760
But if you sign up at curiositystream.com slash hbomberguy

568
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
and use hbomberguy as the promo code,

569
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
the first 31 days are free,

570
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,560
so you could watch documentaries and have a jar of Nutella.

571
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,200
Although, you shouldn't eat Nutella out of the jar.

572
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
That was actually really bad for you. Don't.

573
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,080
Then again, I'm—I can't criticize people's life choices.

574
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,280
There's literally two empty eggshells from some soft-boiled eggs

575
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,640
I had, like, two days ago just sitting on my desk directly under my mic.

576
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,680
Like, seriously, listen.

577
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
I just broke an eggshell in my hand that's just there on my desk.

578
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,260
So...

579
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,520
Look, there's some good documentaries out—

580
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
I need to go wash my dishes. I'm sorry.

581
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Speaking of being a morally compromised corporate shill,

582
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
it's time to talk about Patrick Moore.

583
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,240
Patrick Moore is a Canadian activist and environmentalist.

584
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,520
Moore was the leader of Greenpeace Canada for about nine years.

585
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
Moore is also in the Climate Denial Game,

586
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,480
but he's playing it on Nightmare Mode.

587
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,760
His specific stance is that carbon dioxide levels are affected by humans,

588
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,040
but that an increase in CO2 is actually great!

589
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,080
CO2 is what plants crave, after all!

590
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
CO2 is the most important nutrient for all life on Earth.

591
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,080
So we've been skipping along on top of this low point for CO2 for a long time now,

592
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,880
and it's about time somebody did something about it.

593
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,120
And so what if sea levels rise?

594
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,680
Don't you know that humans are mostly water?

595
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,000
We need it to live! It's good for us!

596
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,360
Drink up, fucker!

597
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
It's like Carlin said,

598
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,240
the reason people came into existence is because the Earth wants plastic.

599
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,120
Oh my god, he's doing George Carlin, but not for a joke.

600
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
And maybe the reason people came into existence

601
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,160
is because the atmosphere wants a little more carbon dioxide for the plants.

602
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,640
Who knows?

603
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
If only there were people whose job was to find out.

604
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Oh, you think those people are paid shills

605
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,720
who are just pretending it might be caused by humans for money?

606
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
This is Nassau at its worst.

607
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,160
They do good things too,

608
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,160
but they also collect over a billion dollars in climate change research money

609
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,640
from the federal government in the United States.

610
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,680
And they do this.

611
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,120
CO2 controls Earth's temperature to keep getting that funding.

612
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,560
Here he is complaining about a comedy sketch Bill Nye did lately

613
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,760
on the basis that he's being so mean about CO2,

614
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,480
he's demonizing it and hurting its fee-wings.

615
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,320
Has anyone noticed the fire extinguisher on the table as the Earth burns?

616
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,120
Many fire extinguishers are filled with CO2.

617
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
The science guy could have put the fire out with carbon dioxide,

618
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,960
which he wrongly demonizes as the cause of the fire.

619
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,800
Um, I hate to break it to you, Mr. Moore,

620
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,880
but Bill Nye was employing an experimental technique

621
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,800
some people might not have heard of before called a visual metaphor.

622
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm not sure if people have noticed,

623
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,120
but this isn't actually literally happening to the planet.

624
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
The Earth isn't actually on fire.

625
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,880
What's actually happening is CO2 is contributing to trapping more heat in the atmosphere,

626
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,160
causing a warming effect.

627
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
Which is tough to represent visually.

628
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,560
When a fire extinguisher is used,

629
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,600
the CO2 doesn't actually react with the fire directly to stop it from being fire.

630
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,800
It actually displaces the oxygen that keeps the fire going,

631
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
which helps extinguish it,

632
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,600
with the secondary effect that the CO2 in the pressurized container

633
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
is colder than room temperature,

634
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
and therefore, the...

635
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,760
CO2 is not a magic turn-fire-off gas!

636
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,040
Having more in the atmosphere doesn't mean fires will go out easier.

637
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,000
God damn it!

638
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,920
You're wrong, H-bomber lie.

639
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,520
You can't have too much of something if it's good for you.

640
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,720
Now watch as I consume enough brain force to surpass even Ben Shapiro's power.

641
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,800
No! Reasonablist bear!

642
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,440
Don't!

643
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,880
Your body can't take that much alertness and free thinking!

644
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
At the end of the clip, Bill tries to blow the fire out,

645
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,520
but did you know that breath also contains carbon dioxide?

646
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
Checkmate, globe heads!

647
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,240
I just proved...

648
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,360
Oh, no!

649
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
He died from having too much IQ!

650
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,960
Rest in peace.

651
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,760
If you didn't like that character, he's dead.

652
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,720
He's gone now.

653
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Since quitting Greenpeace over...

654
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
differences in policy,

655
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
and Greenpeace have done everything they can to distance themselves from him since he left,

656
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,080
Moore has become a consultant for businesses

657
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,800
that get a bad rap from environmental organizations.

658
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,640
As a former hire up at Greenpeace,

659
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,720
Moore's a great catch for these industries.

660
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,080
It's a compelling narrative.

661
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,240
Here's someone who really did care about the planet,

662
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,960
but he's come out against the people who say we're being unethical

663
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,640
and saying that actually we're good,

664
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,920
so we must be!

665
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,640
Steven Crowder's second and third most popular videos

666
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
about the climate are interviews with Moore.

667
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,400
He's also gone on PragerU as well to list off his regular talking points,

668
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,640
but in an even more stilted manner.

669
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
I think something's wrong with PragerU's teleprompter.

670
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
This keeps happening when people go on.

671
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
He's just a real get, you know?

672
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
He's the guy! He's the guy from Greenpeace,

673
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
and he says global warming's not real!

674
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,080
We got him! We just have to keep quoting him!

675
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,040
It's like we're right!

676
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,640
We don't have to check or anything!

677
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,520
They don't drag this guy onto everything because he's right,

678
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,560
because he's not.

679
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,400
They drag him on because they can say

680
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,840
Greenpeace founder debunks climate in their video titles

681
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
and everyone who wants to believe this can go,

682
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,760
oh, well, that sounds about right,

683
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,720
and, you know, not actually check what he's saying or anything,

684
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,400
which is all wrong.

685
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,160
Basically everything he says about the climate

686
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,840
can be debunked if you question it,

687
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,320
but no one watching this is going to, are they?

688
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
They think these people have already done it for them.

689
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,080
Moore positions himself as the sensible environmentalist.

690
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
You know, not like those senseless ones

691
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
that accept the science and, for some reason,

692
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
think we should do something about it.

693
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,960
I suppose it is sensible, in one sense of the word,

694
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,480
to take money from big companies

695
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
to try to rehabilitate their image.

696
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm sure the Koch brothers pay very well.

697
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I hate to sound like I'm beating a dead hawk—

698
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,400
uh, dog here.

699
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,040
["crying"]

700
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,200
But I wasn't joking when I said that.

701
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,760
This talk here is at the Heartland Institute,

702
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,920
a conservative and libertarian think tank

703
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
dedicated mostly to opposing

704
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840
the scientific outlook on climate change.

705
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,000
It receives a very large portion of its funding

706
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,280
from the Koch Foundation,

707
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,000
an organization founded and run by the Koch brothers,

708
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,360
two incredibly wealthy ultra-billionaire oil barons

709
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,440
who have spent literally decades

710
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,280
spreading this kind of misinformation.

711
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,040
It's almost as if this whole thing

712
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,560
is just a bunch of rich people

713
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,080
trying to hold on to their money

714
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,920
by paying to spread lies.

715
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,200
By the way, they're one of the main donors

716
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
to PragerU and the Rubin Report.

717
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,600
What a surprise.

718
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,560
It's actually pretty clear

719
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,880
why Moore's imagination immediately goes

720
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,920
to being paid to support a scientific conclusion.

721
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,400
After all, that is what he's doing.

722
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Patrick Moore's denialism is wrong,

723
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
and obviously wrong because of course it is,

724
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
and his corporate cheerleading is just immoral,

725
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,560
but he goes one step further sometimes

726
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,520
in a way that I find special.

727
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,280
You see, with denialism

728
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,880
and with general anti-science fakery,

729
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,200
there's a line that you can't cross.

730
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,920
There's a reason why a lot of these people say things like,

731
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,760
oh, well, you know, I'm not an expert, but...

732
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,880
So here's my take on the climate change issue.

733
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,640
On the climate change issue,

734
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,480
I'm not gonna pretend that I'm an expert

735
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
in reading the studies.

736
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,720
Don't worry, Ben.

737
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
You didn't have to volunteer that information.

738
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
It was already obvious.

739
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,160
This tacit admission of potential ignorance

740
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
is an important part of the trickery

741
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,000
because if you claimed to actually know

742
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
what you were talking about,

743
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,560
it would become crystal clear you were deliberately lying

744
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,280
when it turned out you were so obviously wrong,

745
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,120
but if you say you're an amateur,

746
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,720
there's deniability.

747
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
If Shapiro says something wrong,

748
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,200
well, like he said, he hadn't looked that hard into it,

749
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,240
and he's not an expert,

750
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,320
so for all you know, he wasn't lying.

751
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,200
My purpose here is not at all to pretend to be a scientist

752
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,800
but to get you, the viewer, to think about real science.

753
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm not pretending to be a scientist.

754
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,880
I just want you to have a think about

755
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,240
the one and only one piece of evidence

756
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
I'm going to show you.

757
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,560
With bullshit, even with ridiculous bullshit,

758
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,040
even with obvious lies,

759
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,000
there is a line.

760
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
I'm establishing this because, in 2014,

761
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Patrick Moore tripped on his own dick

762
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400
and fell all the way through the line

763
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,360
and onto a live rail and electrocuted himself.

764
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,280
Metaphorically, of course.

765
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm referring to here.

766
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
It's the thing Patrick Moore is known for

767
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,800
more than anything now.

768
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,960
I'm referring, of course,

769
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
to the weed killer incident.

770
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,240
Okay, so some background here.

771
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
There's a product called Roundup

772
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,520
which was originally produced by Monsanto

773
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,280
but has later been acquired by Bayer.

774
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
It's based on a chemical called glyphosate,

775
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,600
a chemical Monsanto discovered and patented,

776
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,080
and it's the most used herbicide in the United States

777
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,440
and on the planet, for that matter.

778
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
However, there is some evidence

779
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
that Roundup causes cancer

780
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,880
if you come into heavy, repeated contact with it.

781
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,400
There isn't evidence, to my knowledge,

782
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,360
that crops treated with it become dangerous to eat

783
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,240
or that limited domestic use is dangerous in this regard,

784
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
but farmers who use it in large amounts

785
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,720
and other agricultural workers like groundskeepers

786
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
have an increased likelihood to be diagnosed

787
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,160
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of blood cancer.

788
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,240
Roundup's current owners, Bayer,

789
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,360
have recently been ordered

790
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,520
to pay billions of dollars in damages

791
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,360
after it was found Roundup had failed

792
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,600
to inform customers of the potential risks

793
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,040
of using their product.

794
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,240
Over 300 more federal lawsuits have been filed,

795
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,880
and Costco recently discontinued selling Roundup.

796
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,040
It was also banned in France in January.

797
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,200
While all of these allegations were happening,

798
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,520
French journalist Paul Marrera asked Moore

799
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,160
about the safety and potential risks of glyphosate,

800
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,160
and Moore, in an attempt to defend the herbicide, said this.

801
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,360
-"Do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina

802
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,200
is causing increases in cancer.

803
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you."

804
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,920
Now, obviously you shouldn't drink weed killer.

805
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,160
This was either a mistake or a lie,

806
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,520
but Marrera had a sense of humor

807
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,600
and asked him if he would like to drink some.

808
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,840
-"You want to drink some? We have some here."

809
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,440
-"I'd be happy to, actually."

810
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
But then...click!

811
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,640
You can see it in his eyes.

812
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,800
You can see him realize he's taken the lie

813
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,920
to support the big corporation a bit too far,

814
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,360
and he just said he'd be happy to drink weed killer.

815
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
What follows is, I feel,

816
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,120
one of the most informative clips

817
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,120
about the ideology that underpins denialism in history.

818
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,240
-"I'd be happy to, actually. Not really, but..."

819
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,920
-"Not really?" -"I know it wouldn't hurt me."

820
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,160
-"If you say so. I have some glyphosate."

821
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,440
-"No, no, I'm not stupid."

822
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
-"Ah, okay, so you..."

823
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,640
-"No, but I know that..." -"So it's dangerous, right?"

824
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,320
-"No, people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly."

825
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,440
-"Tell the truth." -"It's not dangerous to humans. No, it's not."

826
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,360
-"So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?"

827
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,040
-"No, I'm not an idiot."

828
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
This is a funny clip, and it was shared widely when it happened.

829
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,800
Although Moore is often credited as a Monsanto lobbyist,

830
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,840
which isn't true.

831
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,600
A Monsanto spokesperson denies him ever having been a paid lobbyist,

832
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,760
but his cheerleading for a big company

833
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
and his being mistaken for a lobbyist

834
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,400
is unsurprising when, in the almost 30 years

835
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,760
since he left Greenpeace,

836
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
he makes his living lobbying for companies like Monsanto

837
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,360
and leveraging his former Greenpeace status.

838
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,960
I mean, he named his company Green Spirit for Sobeck's sake,

839
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,200
but this clip makes it clearer than anywhere else

840
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
that beneath the veneer of just being skeptical

841
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,680
of the scientists and their agendas

842
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,320
lies people whose job is not at all

843
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,800
related to finding or sharing the truth.

844
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
Moore realized he'd fucked up

845
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
and immediately fled the interview.

846
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,560
Think about the disconnect as he flicked

847
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
between his defense of a company's product,

848
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,840
claiming it was safe to drink and he'd be happy to,

849
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
and his rational brain,

850
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,600
the brain that actually knows the truth,

851
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
his understanding that drinking it

852
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,720
might actually be really bad

853
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,320
and he shouldn't take that risk.

854
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
But he accidentally took that extra step,

855
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,160
said he would be happy to,

856
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,200
and now has to argue that he would love to drink some,

857
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,280
but he won't because he's not stupid.

858
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
Climate denialism isn't just a bunch of people who are wrong.

859
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
It's a bunch of people being paid to be wrong on purpose,

860
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,960
to deliberately spread doubt of the truth,

861
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
mislead the people who are honestly trying to be skeptical,

862
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
and confirm the beliefs of the ignorant

863
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
who want to pretend they're skeptical,

864
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
and ultimately this contributes to perpetuating

865
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,520
the profits of a few rich individuals

866
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,240
who do not want to be made to reduce their profits

867
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
or risk being held accountable for the effect

868
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,200
their profiteering is having on the world we live on

869
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
at the expense of that world.

870
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,560
To pretend that there is a real, legitimate,

871
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
non-astroturfed debate

872
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,960
about whether climate change is caused by humans

873
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,800
and represents a potential threat

874
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
is to give into propaganda from people who are lying

875
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,480
and know they're lying and are so used to lying

876
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,280
that they will tell you it's safe to drink a weed killer

877
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,480
that might be giving the farmers who work with it cancer.

878
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
They will tell you that being alarmed

879
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,160
about a credible threat to humanity's future

880
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,920
makes you an alarmist.

881
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,200
They will lie to your fucking face

882
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,680
while telling you they're the true warriors

883
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,280
of science and logic.

884
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
Something can still be done about the climate.

885
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,880
It simply requires dispelling these corporate lies,

886
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
seeing past the people selling you the chance

887
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,440
to pretend you know better than scientists,

888
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,000
agitating for real political change,

889
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,600
and advocating for a culture that actually accepts science,

890
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,480
actually employs reason and skepticism,

891
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,800
and doesn't just pretend they're magic words

892
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
that can be used to make you sound clever.

893
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,760
Almost everyone thinks science and facts

894
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
and logic and truth are great.

895
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,480
We all agree that those words are lovely

896
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,320
and mean good things.

897
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
The problem is a lot of people set out

898
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,440
to prove those things are on their side

899
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,000
instead of following those things where they lead.

900
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,240
It's very easy to be misled by rhetoric

901
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,120
into thinking that one idea is more reasonable than another,

902
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,880
and it's even easier to find someone

903
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,520
who's willing to tell you that what you think right now

904
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,680
is already the reasonable thing.

905
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,920
That doesn't make you actually right, though.

906
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,840
I'm not a very smart person,

907
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,720
and this isn't a self-deprecating joke I'm doing here.

908
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,400
Everyone who thinks Dark Souls 2 is bad

909
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
can attest to this already.

910
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
I remember once I went to mail a letter

911
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,280
and accidentally put the sunglasses

912
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,200
in my other hand into the mailbox,

913
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,680
and I just tried to quietly erase the memory

914
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,440
of watching the sunglasses fade out of view

915
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,800
and then drop from my hands

916
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,920
as at the very last moment my brain went,

917
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,560
hang on.

918
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,040
I'm saying this because while humans can be very smart

919
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,560
about some things in specific,

920
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,600
sometimes humans are, in general,

921
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,200
very bad about a lot of things.

922
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,600
It's very easy to look at a horizon and say,

923
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,080
well, it looks flat to me,

924
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,160
or to discount the work of scientists

925
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,880
because, well, it just looks a different way to you.

926
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,720
And it's very easy to dismiss anyone

927
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,280
who might be an authority on an issue as, well,

928
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,640
an argument from authority.

929
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,840
After all, a PhD is just a piece of paper.

930
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,800
It doesn't necessarily mean what that person says is right,

931
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,040
and you would be right to assume that,

932
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,920
but I also think it's wrong to use that

933
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,640
as a deliberate strategy to avoid dealing with the fact

934
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,360
that sometimes people do know better than you

935
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,640
about complex issues.

936
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,480
If you find it easy to discount

937
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,640
hundreds of people's life's work

938
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,400
because you reckon you know better

939
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,880
based on one paper you've read,

940
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,520
then you might as well have put your brain in the mailbox.

941
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
So it turns out there's an advantage

942
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,480
to being as rubbish as me.

943
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,240
It means you have to put effort into learning things

944
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
and develop a respect and appreciation

945
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
for the people who put so much time

946
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
into learning something

947
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,800
and an understanding that maybe they do know more than you.

948
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
When I find myself disagreeing

949
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
with the conclusions of a scientist,

950
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,960
I ask myself what they might know that I don't

951
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,520
and go look for that and see if that changes my mind.

952
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,640
And when I find a scientist that I happen to find agreeable,

953
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,680
I immediately think,

954
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
well, if they think like I do, then, well, something's up.

955
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
Let's see what the others have to say

956
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,080
and why they might think they're wrong

957
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,280
and what their reasons are.

958
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,360
The true test of skepticism

959
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,560
isn't in finding ways to debunk your opponents

960
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,720
or change anyone else's mind.

961
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,400
It's in finding ways to understand when you are wrong

962
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
and learn to change your mind.

963
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,160
Sometimes that's easier than others.

964
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,840
For example, in this instance,

965
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,240
a lot of people who currently deny climate change

966
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,440
can freely admit that they were lied to.

967
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,480
They were misled by people who only showed them facts

968
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,160
that appeared to confirm their beliefs.

969
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,760
They hadn't really thought that hard about it.

970
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,120
In fact, their thinking had basically been done for them.

971
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,520
They'd given over the thinking to someone else

972
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,360
who it turned out they couldn't trust

973
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,440
and now they can think for themselves

974
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,360
and maybe come to different conclusions.

975
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,400
I changed a lot the day I realized

976
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,960
that there are people out there who make a living

977
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,400
making you feel good for believing what they tell you

978
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,840
and, frankly, it gives me hope that that happened to me

979
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,200
because I know I'm a foolish person

980
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,520
and if I can learn and grow and change

981
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
then there's hope for all of us

982
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
and I believe that even you,

983
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,400
yes, you, can one day come to accept the truth

984
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,720
that horses don't exist.

985
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
That's what this video is about.

986
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,440
Goodbye.
