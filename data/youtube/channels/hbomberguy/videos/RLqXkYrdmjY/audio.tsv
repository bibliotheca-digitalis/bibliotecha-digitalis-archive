0	2000	This vid...
2000	4000	Pfft.
4000	10800	Oh, you like your peanut butter, don't you, Mortimer?
10800	13360	Oh, he's a good boy, aww.
13360	19200	Hey, friends! Did you know that climate change is definitely real and definitely affected by human action?
19200	26320	I had to ask because, well, some people deny that that's happening, and this video is about them.
26320	32000	Now, I'm not here to pretend that there's a real debate in science about whether CO2 affects global temperatures,
32000	34000	or whether humans have a hand in it.
34000	36480	The science is settled and the deniers are wrong.
36480	40960	Oh, yeah, call them deniers to make them look bad.
40960	43760	That's a classic straw man argument.
43760	48880	They're not denying climate change, they're just skeptical that it's happening.
48880	51520	See, it's actually very smart when you put it that way.
51600	58160	And look how this degenerate refuses to engage in reasonable debate with people who disagree with him.
58160	60160	That's not rational at all.
60160	64160	How can the issue be settled if you haven't debunked your opponent's points?
64160	65440	Look, mate, I hate to be dogmatic, but-
65440	66560	AAAAAAAAHHHHH!
66560	73840	But I think any reasonable analysis of climate deniers has to contend with the extreme deficit of actual facts
73840	78800	on the side of people who claim to be the ones who know the facts better than the actual researchers.
78800	84560	When someone specifically positions themselves as pro-science and fetishizes the idea of reason,
84560	88400	the fact they're being unreasonable is something that needs to be brought up.
88400	92240	We're gonna get into it, but if someone's evidence is so poor that even me,
92240	96720	a gaming YouTuber who got peanut butter in his ear when he was setting up the first shot for this video,
96720	100640	can see the holes in it, then something's really gone wrong here.
100640	103440	So in this video, we're gonna look at some prominent climate deniers,
103440	106800	what they have to say, why what they say is clearly wrong,
106800	108640	why they seem to believe it anyway,
108640	111120	how people get to be climate deniers,
111120	114560	and what we can do to have- make there be less of the-
114560	116880	...
116880	117520	Nailed it!
117520	120640	I suppose one thing you could do is just let the ice sheets melt.
120640	125280	I mean, the problem would kind of go away if most of them drowned.
125280	127680	Ooh! Oh! I'm dying!
127680	129360	Oh, I guess I was wrong!
129360	129920	Oops!
129920	134720	...
134720	136080	WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!
136080	138880	...
138880	142320	Now, climate denialism doesn't come in just one flavor.
142320	145840	No, like ogres, the issue has layers.
145840	149360	And unlike ogres, climate deniers are not all-stars.
149360	152160	Although the ice they skate is getting pretty thin,
152160	155280	and the water's getting warm, so they might as well swim.
155280	157520	Smash Mouth's all-star was about climate change.
157520	158720	CHANGE MY MIND!
158720	161920	Deniers range from claiming the climate isn't actually changing at all
161920	165120	to admitting that the climate changes but that humans don't have an effect
165120	167440	and it's probably just normal that things have got so warm lately.
167440	168880	I'm sure it'll go back to normal soon.
168880	172000	To claiming that CO2 doesn't really have an effect on the climate.
172000	176400	To saying that even if it does, it's actually good for us since plants need CO2.
176400	180560	To saying it's real but it's not that bad and scientists are exaggerating.
180560	182720	To saying, well, look, I'm confused.
182720	184720	A lot of people are saying a lot of different things,
184720	187520	so I guess it's still up for debate and we shouldn't do anything.
187520	188400	Ah, that's great.
188400	191040	See, even cowards have a place in denialism.
191040	192640	If you haven't heard of Ben Shapiro,
192640	194960	then your YouTube recommendations bar is glitched out.
194960	199440	Shapiro is a conservative commentator who's very popular with people who already agree with him
199440	203040	and he's really good at winning debates with teenagers who haven't finished university
203040	205200	and don't have all the media training he has.
205200	207440	He was editor-at-large of Breitbart for four years
207440	209840	and he's written ten books about how it's the left's fault
209840	212560	that conservatism keeps making things worse for everyone.
212560	214400	He's a true intellectual gymnast,
214400	217280	the kind that can write tweets decrying when the left talk about
217280	219120	how they're on the right side of history
219120	222800	and then publish an entire book called The Right Side of History.
222800	227200	Here he is, dipping his webbed flippers into the pool of climate change
227200	230160	with his signature Shapiro intellect.
230160	232400	So let's say, let's say, for the sake of argument,
232400	236960	that all of the water levels around the world rise by, let's say, five feet
236960	237840	over the next hundred years.
237840	239360	Say ten feet by the next hundred years
239360	243520	and it puts all the low-lying areas on the coast underwater.
243520	245520	Right? Which, let's say all of that happens.
245520	248320	You think that people aren't going to just sell their homes and move?
248320	262960	Just one small problem.
262960	265440	Sell their houses to who, Ben?
265440	267200	Fucking Aquaman!
279280	283120	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
283120	285040	Sigh.
286320	289040	It was watching this talk by Shapiro that got me wanting to
289040	291840	look at and analyze climate denial in more detail
291840	294880	because this absolute genius-brained idea that
294880	298800	everyone affected by things like floods can just sell their homes
298800	302320	to people who would love to buy a flooding house, apparently,
302320	304000	and move somewhere else,
304000	307280	well, it begs a lot of questions about how these people think.
307280	310000	How have things reached a point where someone thinks they can get away
310000	313520	with saying something this ridiculous in front of an audience of people,
313520	316000	and how have things reached a point where some people in that audience
316000	319520	won't recognize it for the obvious, ignorant bullshit that it is?
319520	322640	This led me down a particular hole of discovery.
322640	326480	I realized that climate deniers aren't just wrong.
326480	329520	They're obviously wrong in very clear ways,
329520	332000	and that makes the whole thing so much more interesting.
332000	335520	How does this work if it's so paper-thin?
335520	337040	Take, for example, Stephen Crowder.
337040	339680	Stephen Crowder is a conservative political commentator,
339680	341600	and Wikipedia tells me he's a comedian,
341600	343600	which I'm glad they mentioned or I wouldn't have noticed.
343600	345760	Crowder's YouTube channel is his special place
345760	348400	to wax lyrical about topical conservative issues.
348400	350880	He's a rational thinker who doesn't play by anyone's rules
350880	352880	and will follow truth wherever it leads,
352880	355360	although it always seems to lead to whatever he wanted to believe
355360	356240	in the first place.
356240	358720	I'm sure it's just a coincidence that he never has to change his mind
358720	359360	about anything.
359360	362400	Crowder has a big beef with Bill Nye, as we've seen in the past,
362400	365520	but that's a byproduct of his more general climate denial.
365520	368000	Of course, Crowder denies being a climate denier.
368000	370320	Crowder positions himself as a climate realist
370320	373280	who acknowledges that the climate has changed and is changing.
373280	377280	It's just not changing in the way that all the scientists say it does.
377280	379280	In other words, he's denying the science
379280	381360	but in denial about denying the science.
381360	384400	His most popular video on the topic has almost two million views
384400	387200	and claims to debunk the top five climate change myths.
387200	388480	We'll get to his others later.
388480	390800	Regarding this one first, however, he's wrong.
390800	393040	This video and everything in it has been debunked
393120	397440	repeatedly and epically by many people online on the internet already,
397440	399360	so I'm not gonna really do that too much.
399360	401760	Okay, you've noticed it by now. There's no avoiding it.
401760	403920	Uh, when I was hitting the wall with the axe,
403920	405920	I got a little bit of debris on my mouth
405920	407600	and I didn't notice it for a couple takes.
408240	410880	Just try not to look at it and we'll all get through it together.
410880	414560	What I want to draw attention to here is how blatantly wrong it is
414560	417360	to anyone who's willing to do even a smidgen of research.
417360	420720	One of the myths he tries to debunk is that the ice sheets are melting.
420720	422800	Number two, you've heard this one everywhere.
422880	424880	The ice sheets are melting!
424880	428320	If the ice sheets were melting, it would cause an increase in sea levels
428320	431600	as all of the water in the ice makes its way into the oceans.
431600	436640	It would also increase CO2 levels because CO2 is stored in ice
436640	438320	and then escapes when it melts.
438320	440160	It would affect the albedo of the planet,
440160	444160	its ability to reflect, uh, the heat and light of the sun.
444160	446080	It wouldn't just make things worse on its own,
446080	449280	it would exacerbate the process by which things are getting worse.
450240	454000	But don't worry, Steven Crowder's done a picosecond of googling
454000	456000	and he's decided that they're not melting.
456000	457520	In fact, they're growing!
457520	462080	The Antarctic ice sheets are actually growing by billions of tons per year.
462080	466320	Does that come to me from climatechangedenialslashflatearthers.com?
466320	467840	No, how about NASA?
467840	469680	According to the new analysis of satellite data,
469680	475200	the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice per year
475200	477200	from 1992 to 2001.
477280	479920	Oh, shit, he's using facts and logic!
479920	481040	Sound the alarms!
481040	482160	Battle stations!
482160	483200	Prepare for impact!
484080	485840	Actually, one question.
485840	491200	When you said ice sheets, that's a plural sound.
492720	497840	Could it be that there's another ice sheet, say, in Greenland,
498800	503280	where the opposite is true and it's melting really quickly
504080	506800	and maybe there's a net loss of ice?
507440	508640	I wonder what he'll say about it.
508640	509520	He doesn't bring it up.
509520	509920	He doesn't.
509920	511680	Just pretend Greenland doesn't exist.
511680	513760	According to the European Environmental Agency,
513760	516800	between the years of 2002 to 2011,
516800	521760	Greenland lost an average of 215 billion tons of ice per year.
521760	524800	Then in 2012, it lost 500 billion.
524800	526160	So if you do some quick maths there,
526160	530720	you'll probably notice that even if Antarctica is growing at the rate Crowder says it is,
530720	532400	which we'll get back to that later,
532400	537680	over 100 billion tons of ice per year is now water in our oceans,
537680	541360	which appear to be rising for some inexplicable reason.
541360	543040	Look, if you live in Venice,
543040	547120	just sell your house to the Innsmouth people and move away.
547120	548160	It's fine.
548160	548640	It's all...
549360	551280	There's also the slightly deeper problem
551280	556160	that Crowder's point about the Antarctic ice sheets isn't actually true either.
556160	561040	The article that he posts up links to a study in the Journal of Glaciology entitled
561040	564480	Mass Gains of the Antarctic Ice Sheet Exceed Losses.
565120	566320	Note that it says
566320	568320	Antarctic ice sheet
568320	571920	because it's talking about the Antarctic ice sheet on its own
571920	574080	and not the one in Greenland,
574080	575440	which is melting.
575440	578560	The study was focused on a specific part of East Antarctica,
578560	580800	which most climatologists agree is growing.
580800	582560	The question has been how much
582560	586400	and whether this offsets the overall losses in West Antarctica,
586400	587360	which is melting,
587360	590720	and whether Antarctica overall is losing or gaining ice.
590720	593040	Linked in the description is a really interesting breakdown
593040	595280	by Shannon Hall for Scientific American.
595280	596000	No, Paul.
596000	597360	Not the blog section.
597360	600880	An actual article exploring why other climatologists disagree
600880	602720	with this particular study's findings.
602720	604880	The study calculated the height of glaciers
604880	607040	using methods which other scientists have argued
607040	609120	is less accurate than other available ones,
609120	612080	which presents a danger of the results having been thrown off.
612080	612960	And furthermore,
612960	616000	the study assumes that the height increase is all ice,
616000	618960	whereas others would contend it is largely or partly snowfall,
618960	620720	which is a whole lot less water.
620720	622480	Other studies using different techniques
622480	624320	conclude a much smaller increase,
624320	626560	which means the net change in ice in Antarctica
626560	629280	would be a loss and not a gain in ice.
629280	632720	In other words, Crowder found basically the one study
632720	635120	that contends that the mass gain
635120	637920	exceeds the losses elsewhere in Antarctica,
637920	640480	not net in terms of all the ice sheets,
640480	642080	just in Antarctica,
642080	642640	and went,
642640	643600	oh, that's it, the one.
643600	645280	That's the one proof.
645280	647840	But tons of people disagree about this,
647840	649600	and they have pretty good reasons to.
649600	651680	I highly recommend you read the article for yourself,
651680	654720	or, I mean, you could even read more than one thing
654720	656320	before coming to a conclusion.
656320	658480	I could spend an hour on this paper,
658480	660240	and maybe one day I will.
660240	661280	Let me know in the comments.
662080	663520	But we're pressed for time,
663520	667120	so I will point out that the main author of that paper
667120	668320	is not just NASA.
668320	669760	How about NASA?
669760	671840	More than NASA work on things,
671840	673440	individual people with names do.
673440	675680	The main author of the paper, Jay Zwolle,
675760	677840	was interviewed in the Scientific American,
677840	678880	and he had this to say.
681600	683200	I'm actually going to read this in voiceover
683200	685200	because I forgot to write it in my notes.
685200	686400	"'When our paper came out,
686400	687840	"'I was very careful to emphasize
687840	689680	"'that this is in no way contradictory
689680	691760	"'to the findings of the IPCC report
691760	693360	"'or conclusions that climate change
693360	696080	"'is a serious problem that we need to do something about.'"
696080	700160	Even if Zwolle's paper is 100% accurate,
700160	703280	which many of his associates have reasonable reasons to say
703280	704320	is not correct,
704320	708320	but even if we're still net losing far more ice
708320	709520	through the other sheets,
710240	712960	and the author of the paper believes
712960	715440	that climate change is in fact happening,
715440	718720	he just thinks it hasn't started happening in Antarctica yet,
719280	721600	and that actually does make some sense.
721600	723840	The last thing to start melting
723840	726720	would be the coldest place in the world, right?
726720	727840	I just realized that I don't know
727840	730000	if it's actually the coldest place.
730000	733840	Pretend I said one of the most coldest places.
733840	736800	Oh, I'm gonna weasel my way out of all of my mistakes.
736800	739680	Oh, I learned it from watching you, Stephen!
739680	742080	Crowder's website is just full of this shit.
742080	744240	The website is largely very short articles
744240	747520	about how AOC is a demon or healthcare is communism
747520	749040	or women's bodily autonomy
749040	750880	is basically the Boxer Rebellion,
750880	753360	usually ending in links to whatever video he did lately
753360	755600	that's tangentially related to the subject.
755600	758320	The articles themselves are authored by the site's editor,
758320	759760	Courtney Kirchhoff.
759760	761120	I hope it's not Kirchhoff.
761120	763600	I could check how to pronounce her name.
763600	765600	You know, do basic research,
765600	767200	but I feel in the spirit of things
767200	768720	I should just not fucking bother.
768720	770480	One particular article that interests me
770480	772240	is this one from March this year.
772240	774080	Climate change fail!
774080	776240	Melting glacier is growing again!
776240	778000	The article is the usual waffle
778000	779840	about how everything's always changing
779840	782480	and therefore climate change isn't a threat or something,
782480	783920	but the point it's dancing around
783920	786720	is that a glacier that has been melting in the past
786720	788320	is currently growing.
788320	789840	Then there's another couple paragraphs
789840	791360	of needless editorializing
791360	792880	about how this proves there's nothing wrong
792880	793760	with the climate,
793760	795920	claiming that the melting was caused by human action
795920	798240	is wrong because it's not melting anymore,
798240	800640	weird pontificating about big government
800640	802640	wanting to control people's lives,
802640	804720	and a gif from Zoolander.
804720	806560	In other words, it's the most educated piece
806560	809120	of conservative journalism I've seen all year.
809120	810240	Hey, it's Bomberguy.
810240	811360	HBomberguy here.
811360	813760	Two things about this interest me.
813760	815760	Firstly, I just want to point out
815760	817840	that there's no mention of Greenland,
817840	821600	uh, in Crowder's website or in his videos at all
821680	824400	until the exact instant they think
824400	826080	they can find a mention of it
826080	828080	that proves what they think is happening.
828080	829920	Secondly, even though they think
829920	831680	they've finally found proof
831680	833120	that things are better in Greenland,
833760	837040	it's still just thinly disguised bullshit.
837040	838560	The problem is the impression
838560	840640	that Crowder and his website want to give.
840640	843200	Here's a graph of the mass of Greenland's ice sheets
843200	845920	from late 2016 to January 2017.
845920	846420	See?
847280	848240	Just like she said.
848240	851440	It's just a natural, airborne flow
851520	854400	Sometimes ice melts, but it comes back.
854960	855600	See?
855600	858240	It's almost gained back all of the ice
858240	860160	that it melted in the same time.
860960	861760	It's fine.
861760	864320	But that's a weirdly specific span of time
864320	866080	for someone to talk about, isn't it?
866720	868560	Why would they just show you that?
869680	871680	I mean, time goes back a little bit further
871680	872640	than that, doesn't it?
873360	875280	Let's zoom out a little bit further to, say...
876720	877760	2002.
881840	887040	Oh, I forgot!
887040	889040	These people are fucking liars!
889040	890400	Ice sheets regaining mass
890400	891920	in the colder parts of the year
891920	893760	isn't unexpected and is, in fact,
893760	894960	part of the process.
894960	897920	Unfortunately, not all the melted ice comes back.
897920	900160	The news piece is about one glacier
900160	901680	doing better than expected,
901680	904720	but this doesn't offset the clear general trend.
904720	906640	If you were to draw a line here
906640	908320	and pretend you'd found evidence
908320	909600	the sheets were growing back
909600	911280	as fast as they'd been melting,
911280	912800	you would be doing a lie.
912800	914960	Courtney is doing a version of that
914960	917200	while also pretending one glacier
917200	918560	disproves a wider trend
918560	920400	that's been documented for decades.
920400	922560	The glacier is growing about as quickly
922560	923520	as it was shrinking.
924320	925680	Oh, my God.
925680	927600	The word about is doing some
927600	930000	fucking legwork there, isn't it, Courtney?
930000	931840	Every single time it's documented
931840	933840	that an ice sheet or a glacier
933840	935680	actually gains in size,
935680	937920	there's always a conservative or some blogger
937920	939120	willing to point at it and go,
939120	941840	look, that proves there's not a problem.
941840	943440	Look at this and only this.
943440	944800	The science was lies.
945440	949200	When the point isn't that sometimes
949200	951360	there's more ice than there was before
951360	953360	or sometimes some of it comes back.
954400	956160	The point is that, on the whole,
957120	958160	there's less of it.
958160	960720	We're losing more than we're gaining.
960720	963280	One glacier is not an entire ice sheet.
963280	965840	It's not unexpected that ice sheets grow
965840	968400	and the clock on how big ice sheets used to be
968400	970400	didn't start six months ago.
970400	972080	If everything's proceeding as normal,
972080	974640	where did all this fucking water come from, Courtney?
974640	976400	So, here's the thing.
977520	978800	Let's think about this now.
979520	982240	Crowder was wrong for a variety of reasons,
982960	984640	one of which was so simple
985280	987520	that all you had to do was point out
988080	990560	that there's more than one ice sheet.
990560	992800	The one on his website is debunked
992800	995200	by zooming out on a graph.
995200	998080	Nothing I've pointed out here is special or unique.
998160	1000560	Like I said, this stuff is obvious to anyone
1000560	1002560	who's willing to read a paper for themselves
1002560	1004960	or do almost any kind of critical thinking
1004960	1006000	or fact-checking.
1006000	1008240	What I want to draw attention to here
1008240	1010240	is this obviousness itself
1010240	1013120	because if Crowder cares about science and facts
1013120	1016000	and reason and truth, et cetera, et cetera,
1016000	1016880	blah, blah, blah,
1017840	1020000	how did Crowder miss this?
1020000	1021360	I think it would be a mistake
1021360	1023600	to interpret this as pure ignorance.
1023600	1025040	A much better explanation
1025040	1026400	is that Crowder's business model
1026400	1028480	has nothing to do with finding the truth
1028480	1029520	or rational discourse
1029520	1031280	or raising anyone's consciousness.
1031280	1032960	His business model is about serving
1032960	1034880	a demographic of conservative people
1034880	1037280	who already feel a certain way about the world
1037280	1040160	and the product he's selling is ideology.
1040160	1042720	Crowder's work isn't about having a real debate
1042720	1044480	or debunking the science.
1044480	1045760	It's making an audience
1045760	1047920	that thinks climate change is fake
1047920	1050640	feel like they have a good reason to believe that.
1050640	1052560	Crowder's audience is people who want
1052560	1055040	their pre-existing beliefs validated.
1055040	1056960	They don't actually want the truth.
1056960	1058160	They want to feel like
1058160	1060880	what they already think is the truth
1060880	1062560	and this, it turns out,
1062560	1064400	is a profitable business model.
1064400	1066000	Not just in terms of the ad revenue
1066000	1067040	from the views you'll get
1067040	1068160	when you're telling an audience
1068160	1069440	what they want to be told
1069440	1071920	and how smart they are for wanting to be told it
1071920	1073840	but also in terms of merchandising.
1073840	1075920	Crowder doesn't sell brain pills
1075920	1078560	yet he sells a mug to drink them out of.
1078560	1079920	You know what's genius as well?
1079920	1082560	You can't actually just fucking buy the mug
1082560	1083760	like on his store.
1083760	1085280	No, his store's just, you know,
1085280	1087840	the fucking shittest merch ever.
1087840	1090640	We had to discount the socialism baby onesie.
1090640	1092640	Our warehouse is full of onesies
1092640	1094640	that no one would ever buy.
1094640	1097680	If you want to get into Crowder's hashtag mug club,
1097680	1100160	Crowder does a daily show for Blaze TV,
1100160	1102160	basically Netflix for conservatives,
1102160	1104960	and they charge a subscription of $99 a year
1104960	1107040	but if you do it through Crowder's website,
1107040	1108560	they send you this mug.
1108560	1109680	Made in China.
1109680	1112800	So, the mug costs $99.
1112800	1114240	You can't actually buy the mug.
1114240	1116160	You cannot buy the mug.
1116160	1119760	You-you have to s-s-$99.
1119760	1121520	And this is the point, really.
1121520	1123200	Crowder makes a decent living
1123200	1124720	not having to do research
1124720	1126320	and instead serving an audience
1126320	1128080	a piping hot daily serving
1128080	1129760	of confirmation of their beliefs
1129760	1131360	which they eat up uncritically
1131360	1133120	because the point isn't learning.
1133120	1135760	It's reassurance that they were already right
1135760	1137920	and then they all take a sip in unison
1137920	1140960	from the most expensive utensil they'll ever own
1140960	1143200	which they bought specifically to signal
1143200	1144960	that they support Reason Man
1144960	1147200	and taking back the media?
1147200	1148880	Is Crowder just mad that Fox News
1148880	1150160	dropped him from the network?
1150160	1151840	Crowder's duplicitous falsehoods
1151840	1153280	work specifically because
1153280	1155120	the audience wants to believe them.
1155120	1156400	Not because they're ignorant
1156400	1158080	but because they want to be.
1158080	1159440	Crowder's specific grift
1159440	1161520	is in using the right power words,
1161520	1164960	truth, logic, rationality, reason, science,
1164960	1166880	to mask this deliberate ignorance
1166880	1169360	in a technicolor dream coat of intellect.
1169360	1171520	So the incredibly poor work in his videos
1171520	1174000	is because they know these people will eat it up
1174000	1176240	and trust that they did the research for them
1176240	1177680	so they don't have to.
1177680	1179360	The ignorance of the audience occurs
1179360	1181200	because they're only ever fed this stuff
1181200	1183440	by their favorite conservative news websites
1183440	1185280	and YouTubers and influencers
1185280	1187840	so they never have to stop and look at the real facts.
1187840	1189520	They're convinced they are.
1189520	1191200	They're just further down a chain
1191200	1194560	designed to only feed them facts that they want.
1194560	1197440	Once you're wired into the conservative echo chamber,
1197440	1199760	follow conservative thinkers on Facebook
1199760	1202080	and YouTube and Twitter
1202080	1204400	and read their news websites
1204400	1208160	and buy their mugs and pills and books,
1208160	1210000	you'll only ever come into contact
1210000	1211920	with facts and information
1211920	1214240	that happens to confirm your worldview.
1214240	1217280	And we can see here just how easy it is to take
1217280	1220880	a very specific thing that seems to confirm it,
1220880	1224560	abstract away any inconvenient truths,
1224560	1226000	and then present it as proof
1226080	1228080	that you were already right
1228080	1230960	and very smart and rational for believing it, too.
1230960	1232160	The work is shoddy,
1232160	1234400	and the holes are poorly wallpapered over
1234400	1236240	with scaremongering about the dangers
1236240	1238640	of big government Mino-like,
1238640	1241520	not because they're genuinely trying to convince outsiders
1241520	1243120	to change their minds.
1243120	1245200	It's to try and protect the insiders
1245200	1247280	from having to change their minds.
1247280	1250080	If John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
1250080	1252240	are Earth's climate change archangels,
1252240	1255280	then just let the motherfucker burn.
1255280	1258320	Ah, finally, someone partaking in rational discourse.
1258320	1260320	These people need to be taken seriously.
1260320	1262880	They have to invent a world
1262880	1266480	where the problems that conservatism couldn't solve
1266480	1268400	simply aren't really there.
1268400	1272000	And frankly, I support this way of thinking.
1272000	1275920	I would hate to have to live in the same world as horses,
1275920	1281760	weird, smug little pricks with their eyes and teeth,
1281760	1283440	but I've done some research,
1283440	1286720	and it turns out that horses don't exist!

1312800	1317520	I can see why the climatologists I know try not to bring the topic up too much in conversation.
1317520	1320720	It's just depressing, especially if you agree with them, isn't it?
1320720	1322880	Thinking about the scope of the problem?
1322880	1326480	A lot of sweeping changes will have to be made very quickly on a large scale,
1326480	1330080	or we'll be stuck in an uphill battle against the climate in the future.
1330080	1333920	And given that we can't really personally bring about many of those changes on our own,
1333920	1338320	what's really left to do on planet Earth other than wait to see what happens and

1372800	1375920	I'm cleaning it. I don't want to get it on my hands later if I pick it up again.
1375920	1378720	Linked in the description is a great video by Simon Clarke,
1378720	1381520	a science YouTuber getting a PhD in climate physics,
1381520	1384640	talking about what we ought to be looking into to deal with climate change.
1384640	1388480	His suggestions take place on the level of what sources we use for power
1388480	1392800	and changes in legislation of businesses whose actions directly affect the climate.
1392800	1398160	I think this is important to recognize because I find a lot of people tend to embrace more personal solutions,
1398160	1402480	like driving a more efficient car or using public transport or going vegan and so on.
1402480	1405200	And it has to be acknowledged that these personal choices
1405200	1408320	aren't the primary driver of climate problems in the first place.
1408320	1409760	The wider policies are.
1409760	1414800	It's very easy to give in to the idea that the solution lies in you reducing your personal emissions
1414800	1418800	to create a sense of control and doing your part for this big and scary thing.
1418800	1422080	But that effort maybe ought to be spent fighting to get the big things done,
1422080	1425520	getting people thinking and providing support for meaningful changes.
1425520	1427600	Basically, just don't make it personal.
1428240	1430000	Climate change isn't your fault.
1431440	1432720	It's the Koch brothers' fault.

1484080	1487280	There's literally two empty eggshells from some soft-boiled eggs
1487280	1490640	I had, like, two days ago just sitting on my desk directly under my mic.
1490640	1491680	Like, seriously, listen.
1492240	1495760	I just broke an eggshell in my hand that's just there on my desk.
1495760	1496260	So...
1497680	1499520	Look, there's some good documentaries out—
1499520	1501120	I need to go wash my dishes. I'm sorry.
1501120	1503840	Speaking of being a morally compromised corporate shill,
1503840	1505520	it's time to talk about Patrick Moore.
1507440	1510240	Patrick Moore is a Canadian activist and environmentalist.
1510240	1513520	Moore was the leader of Greenpeace Canada for about nine years.
1513520	1515760	Moore is also in the Climate Denial Game,
1515760	1518480	but he's playing it on Nightmare Mode.
1518480	1523760	His specific stance is that carbon dioxide levels are affected by humans,
1523760	1527040	but that an increase in CO2 is actually great!
1527040	1530080	CO2 is what plants crave, after all!
1530080	1533360	CO2 is the most important nutrient for all life on Earth.
1533360	1540080	So we've been skipping along on top of this low point for CO2 for a long time now,
1540080	1542880	and it's about time somebody did something about it.
1542880	1545120	And so what if sea levels rise?
1545120	1547680	Don't you know that humans are mostly water?
1547680	1550000	We need it to live! It's good for us!
1550000	1551360	Drink up, fucker!
1553440	1554960	It's like Carlin said,
1556160	1560240	the reason people came into existence is because the Earth wants plastic.
1560240	1563120	Oh my god, he's doing George Carlin, but not for a joke.
1563520	1566480	And maybe the reason people came into existence
1566480	1570160	is because the atmosphere wants a little more carbon dioxide for the plants.
1572080	1572640	Who knows?
1573440	1575760	If only there were people whose job was to find out.
1575760	1577760	Oh, you think those people are paid shills
1577760	1580720	who are just pretending it might be caused by humans for money?
1580720	1582880	This is Nassau at its worst.
1582880	1584160	They do good things too,
1584160	1588160	but they also collect over a billion dollars in climate change research money
1588160	1590640	from the federal government in the United States.
1590720	1591680	And they do this.
1592720	1597120	CO2 controls Earth's temperature to keep getting that funding.
1597120	1600560	Here he is complaining about a comedy sketch Bill Nye did lately
1600560	1603760	on the basis that he's being so mean about CO2,
1603760	1606480	he's demonizing it and hurting its fee-wings.
1606480	1610320	Has anyone noticed the fire extinguisher on the table as the Earth burns?
1610320	1613120	Many fire extinguishers are filled with CO2.
1613120	1616400	The science guy could have put the fire out with carbon dioxide,
1616400	1620960	which he wrongly demonizes as the cause of the fire.
1620960	1622800	Um, I hate to break it to you, Mr. Moore,
1623360	1626880	but Bill Nye was employing an experimental technique
1626880	1630800	some people might not have heard of before called a visual metaphor.
1631600	1633760	I'm not sure if people have noticed,
1633760	1637120	but this isn't actually literally happening to the planet.
1637120	1639440	The Earth isn't actually on fire.
1640320	1644880	What's actually happening is CO2 is contributing to trapping more heat in the atmosphere,
1644880	1646160	causing a warming effect.
1646480	1648720	Which is tough to represent visually.
1648720	1650560	When a fire extinguisher is used,
1650560	1655600	the CO2 doesn't actually react with the fire directly to stop it from being fire.
1655600	1658800	It actually displaces the oxygen that keeps the fire going,
1658800	1660400	which helps extinguish it,
1660400	1663600	with the secondary effect that the CO2 in the pressurized container
1663600	1665120	is colder than room temperature,
1665120	1666240	and therefore, the...
1667040	1669760	CO2 is not a magic turn-fire-off gas!
1670960	1675040	Having more in the atmosphere doesn't mean fires will go out easier.
1675040	1676000	God damn it!
1676560	1679920	You're wrong, H-bomber lie.
1679920	1683520	You can't have too much of something if it's good for you.
1683520	1688720	Now watch as I consume enough brain force to surpass even Ben Shapiro's power.
1688720	1690800	No! Reasonablist bear!
1690800	1691440	Don't!
1691440	1694880	Your body can't take that much alertness and free thinking!
1694880	1697520	At the end of the clip, Bill tries to blow the fire out,
1697520	1701520	but did you know that breath also contains carbon dioxide?
1701520	1703360	Checkmate, globe heads!
1703360	1704240	I just proved...
1706000	1709360	Oh, no!
1710080	1712640	He died from having too much IQ!
1714080	1714960	Rest in peace.
1716160	1717760	If you didn't like that character, he's dead.
1717760	1718720	He's gone now.
1718720	1720720	Since quitting Greenpeace over...
1720720	1722640	differences in policy,
1722640	1726320	and Greenpeace have done everything they can to distance themselves from him since he left,
1726320	1728080	Moore has become a consultant for businesses
1728080	1730800	that get a bad rap from environmental organizations.
1730800	1732640	As a former hire up at Greenpeace,
1732640	1734720	Moore's a great catch for these industries.
1734720	1736080	It's a compelling narrative.
1736080	1738240	Here's someone who really did care about the planet,
1738240	1740960	but he's come out against the people who say we're being unethical
1740960	1742640	and saying that actually we're good,
1742640	1743920	so we must be!
1743920	1746640	Steven Crowder's second and third most popular videos
1746640	1748640	about the climate are interviews with Moore.
1748640	1752400	He's also gone on PragerU as well to list off his regular talking points,
1752400	1754640	but in an even more stilted manner.
1754640	1756640	I think something's wrong with PragerU's teleprompter.
1756640	1758320	This keeps happening when people go on.
1758320	1759760	He's just a real get, you know?
1759760	1762320	He's the guy! He's the guy from Greenpeace,
1762320	1764320	and he says global warming's not real!
1764320	1766080	We got him! We just have to keep quoting him!
1766080	1767040	It's like we're right!
1767040	1768640	We don't have to check or anything!
1768640	1771520	They don't drag this guy onto everything because he's right,
1771520	1772560	because he's not.
1772560	1774400	They drag him on because they can say
1774400	1777840	Greenpeace founder debunks climate in their video titles
1777840	1780240	and everyone who wants to believe this can go,
1780240	1781760	oh, well, that sounds about right,
1781760	1784720	and, you know, not actually check what he's saying or anything,
1784720	1786400	which is all wrong.
1786400	1788160	Basically everything he says about the climate
1788160	1789840	can be debunked if you question it,
1789840	1792320	but no one watching this is going to, are they?
1792320	1794720	They think these people have already done it for them.
1794720	1798080	Moore positions himself as the sensible environmentalist.
1798080	1800080	You know, not like those senseless ones
1800080	1802080	that accept the science and, for some reason,
1802080	1803760	think we should do something about it.
1803760	1806960	I suppose it is sensible, in one sense of the word,
1806960	1808480	to take money from big companies
1808480	1810400	to try to rehabilitate their image.
1810400	1812960	I'm sure the Koch brothers pay very well.
1812960	1814960	I hate to sound like I'm beating a dead hawk—
1814960	1816400	uh, dog here.
1816400	1819040	["crying"]
1819040	1821200	But I wasn't joking when I said that.
1821280	1823760	This talk here is at the Heartland Institute,
1823760	1825920	a conservative and libertarian think tank
1825920	1827520	dedicated mostly to opposing
1827520	1829840	the scientific outlook on climate change.
1829840	1832000	It receives a very large portion of its funding
1832000	1833280	from the Koch Foundation,
1833280	1836000	an organization founded and run by the Koch brothers,
1836000	1839360	two incredibly wealthy ultra-billionaire oil barons
1839360	1841440	who have spent literally decades
1841440	1843280	spreading this kind of misinformation.
1843280	1845040	It's almost as if this whole thing
1845040	1846560	is just a bunch of rich people
1846560	1848080	trying to hold on to their money
1848080	1849920	by paying to spread lies.
1849920	1851200	By the way, they're one of the main donors
1851200	1852720	to PragerU and the Rubin Report.
1852720	1853600	What a surprise.
1853600	1854560	It's actually pretty clear
1854560	1856880	why Moore's imagination immediately goes
1856880	1859920	to being paid to support a scientific conclusion.
1859920	1862400	After all, that is what he's doing.
1862400	1864400	Patrick Moore's denialism is wrong,
1864400	1867200	and obviously wrong because of course it is,
1867200	1871360	and his corporate cheerleading is just immoral,
1871360	1874560	but he goes one step further sometimes
1874560	1877520	in a way that I find special.
1877520	1879280	You see, with denialism
1879280	1882880	and with general anti-science fakery,
1882880	1885200	there's a line that you can't cross.
1885200	1887920	There's a reason why a lot of these people say things like,
1887920	1891760	oh, well, you know, I'm not an expert, but...
1891760	1894880	So here's my take on the climate change issue.
1894880	1896640	On the climate change issue,
1896640	1898480	I'm not gonna pretend that I'm an expert
1898480	1900000	in reading the studies.
1900000	1900720	Don't worry, Ben.
1900720	1902720	You didn't have to volunteer that information.
1902720	1904000	It was already obvious.
1904000	1906160	This tacit admission of potential ignorance
1906160	1907760	is an important part of the trickery
1907760	1910000	because if you claimed to actually know
1910000	1911600	what you were talking about,
1911600	1914560	it would become crystal clear you were deliberately lying
1914560	1917280	when it turned out you were so obviously wrong,
1917280	1919120	but if you say you're an amateur,
1919120	1920720	there's deniability.
1920720	1922720	If Shapiro says something wrong,
1922720	1925200	well, like he said, he hadn't looked that hard into it,
1925200	1926240	and he's not an expert,
1926240	1928320	so for all you know, he wasn't lying.
1928320	1931200	My purpose here is not at all to pretend to be a scientist
1931200	1934800	but to get you, the viewer, to think about real science.
1934800	1936800	I'm not pretending to be a scientist.
1936800	1938880	I just want you to have a think about
1938880	1942240	the one and only one piece of evidence
1942240	1943920	I'm going to show you.
1943920	1946560	With bullshit, even with ridiculous bullshit,
1946560	1949040	even with obvious lies,
1949040	1950000	there is a line.
1950000	1952880	I'm establishing this because, in 2014,
1952880	1954880	Patrick Moore tripped on his own dick
1954880	1956400	and fell all the way through the line
1956400	1959360	and onto a live rail and electrocuted himself.
1959360	1961280	Metaphorically, of course.
1961280	1963200	I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm referring to here.
1963200	1965200	It's the thing Patrick Moore is known for
1965200	1966800	more than anything now.
1966800	1968960	I'm referring, of course,
1968960	1970960	to the weed killer incident.
1970960	1972240	Okay, so some background here.
1972240	1973760	There's a product called Roundup
1973760	1975520	which was originally produced by Monsanto
1975520	1977280	but has later been acquired by Bayer.
1977280	1979280	It's based on a chemical called glyphosate,
1979280	1981600	a chemical Monsanto discovered and patented,
1981600	1984080	and it's the most used herbicide in the United States
1984080	1985440	and on the planet, for that matter.
1985440	1986960	However, there is some evidence
1986960	1988480	that Roundup causes cancer
1988480	1990880	if you come into heavy, repeated contact with it.
1990880	1992400	There isn't evidence, to my knowledge,
1992400	1995360	that crops treated with it become dangerous to eat
1995360	1998240	or that limited domestic use is dangerous in this regard,
1998240	2000240	but farmers who use it in large amounts
2000240	2002720	and other agricultural workers like groundskeepers
2002720	2004960	have an increased likelihood to be diagnosed
2004960	2008160	with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of blood cancer.
2008160	2010240	Roundup's current owners, Bayer,
2010240	2011360	have recently been ordered
2011360	2013520	to pay billions of dollars in damages
2013520	2015360	after it was found Roundup had failed
2015360	2017600	to inform customers of the potential risks
2017600	2019040	of using their product.
2019040	2022240	Over 300 more federal lawsuits have been filed,
2022240	2024880	and Costco recently discontinued selling Roundup.
2024880	2027040	It was also banned in France in January.
2027040	2029200	While all of these allegations were happening,
2029200	2031520	French journalist Paul Marrera asked Moore
2031520	2034160	about the safety and potential risks of glyphosate,
2034160	2038160	and Moore, in an attempt to defend the herbicide, said this.
2038160	2041360	-"Do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina
2041360	2043200	is causing increases in cancer.
2043200	2046000	You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you."
2046000	2049920	Now, obviously you shouldn't drink weed killer.
2050000	2052160	This was either a mistake or a lie,
2052160	2053520	but Marrera had a sense of humor
2053520	2055600	and asked him if he would like to drink some.
2055600	2057840	-"You want to drink some? We have some here."
2057840	2059440	-"I'd be happy to, actually."
2059440	2061040	But then...click!
2061040	2062640	You can see it in his eyes.
2062640	2064800	You can see him realize he's taken the lie
2064800	2067920	to support the big corporation a bit too far,
2067920	2071360	and he just said he'd be happy to drink weed killer.
2071360	2073360	What follows is, I feel,
2073360	2075120	one of the most informative clips
2075120	2079120	about the ideology that underpins denialism in history.
2079120	2082240	-"I'd be happy to, actually. Not really, but..."
2082240	2083920	-"Not really?" -"I know it wouldn't hurt me."
2083920	2086160	-"If you say so. I have some glyphosate."
2086160	2087440	-"No, no, I'm not stupid."
2087440	2088880	-"Ah, okay, so you..."
2088880	2090640	-"No, but I know that..." -"So it's dangerous, right?"
2090640	2094320	-"No, people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly."
2094320	2097440	-"Tell the truth." -"It's not dangerous to humans. No, it's not."
2097440	2099360	-"So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?"
2099360	2101040	-"No, I'm not an idiot."
2101040	2104160	This is a funny clip, and it was shared widely when it happened.
2104160	2106800	Although Moore is often credited as a Monsanto lobbyist,
2106800	2107840	which isn't true.
2107840	2111600	A Monsanto spokesperson denies him ever having been a paid lobbyist,
2111600	2113760	but his cheerleading for a big company
2113760	2115760	and his being mistaken for a lobbyist
2115760	2118400	is unsurprising when, in the almost 30 years
2118400	2119760	since he left Greenpeace,
2119760	2122880	he makes his living lobbying for companies like Monsanto
2122880	2125360	and leveraging his former Greenpeace status.
2125360	2128960	I mean, he named his company Green Spirit for Sobeck's sake,
2128960	2131200	but this clip makes it clearer than anywhere else
2131200	2133760	that beneath the veneer of just being skeptical
2133760	2135680	of the scientists and their agendas
2135760	2138320	lies people whose job is not at all
2138320	2140800	related to finding or sharing the truth.
2140800	2142400	Moore realized he'd fucked up
2142400	2144240	and immediately fled the interview.
2144240	2146560	Think about the disconnect as he flicked
2146560	2148960	between his defense of a company's product,
2148960	2151840	claiming it was safe to drink and he'd be happy to,
2151840	2153360	and his rational brain,
2153360	2155600	the brain that actually knows the truth,
2155600	2157200	his understanding that drinking it
2157200	2158720	might actually be really bad
2158720	2160320	and he shouldn't take that risk.
2160320	2162800	But he accidentally took that extra step,
2162800	2164160	said he would be happy to,
2164240	2167200	and now has to argue that he would love to drink some,
2167200	2169280	but he won't because he's not stupid.
2169280	2172640	Climate denialism isn't just a bunch of people who are wrong.
2172640	2176480	It's a bunch of people being paid to be wrong on purpose,
2176480	2178960	to deliberately spread doubt of the truth,
2178960	2182960	mislead the people who are honestly trying to be skeptical,
2182960	2184960	and confirm the beliefs of the ignorant
2184960	2186800	who want to pretend they're skeptical,
2186800	2189200	and ultimately this contributes to perpetuating
2189200	2191520	the profits of a few rich individuals
2191520	2194240	who do not want to be made to reduce their profits
2194240	2196560	or risk being held accountable for the effect
2196560	2199200	their profiteering is having on the world we live on
2199200	2201520	at the expense of that world.
2201520	2204560	To pretend that there is a real, legitimate,
2204560	2206560	non-astroturfed debate
2206560	2208960	about whether climate change is caused by humans
2208960	2210800	and represents a potential threat
2210800	2214720	is to give into propaganda from people who are lying
2214720	2218480	and know they're lying and are so used to lying
2218480	2221280	that they will tell you it's safe to drink a weed killer
2221280	2224480	that might be giving the farmers who work with it cancer.
2224480	2226320	They will tell you that being alarmed
2226320	2230160	about a credible threat to humanity's future
2230160	2231920	makes you an alarmist.
2231920	2235200	They will lie to your fucking face
2235200	2237680	while telling you they're the true warriors
2237680	2239280	of science and logic.
2239280	2241680	Something can still be done about the climate.
2241680	2244880	It simply requires dispelling these corporate lies,
2244880	2247200	seeing past the people selling you the chance
2247200	2249440	to pretend you know better than scientists,
2249440	2252000	agitating for real political change,
2252000	2255600	and advocating for a culture that actually accepts science,
2255600	2258480	actually employs reason and skepticism,
2258480	2260800	and doesn't just pretend they're magic words
2260800	2263200	that can be used to make you sound clever.
2263200	2265760	Almost everyone thinks science and facts
2265760	2268720	and logic and truth are great.
2268720	2270480	We all agree that those words are lovely
2270480	2272320	and mean good things.
2272320	2274720	The problem is a lot of people set out
2274720	2277440	to prove those things are on their side
2277440	2280000	instead of following those things where they lead.
2280000	2282240	It's very easy to be misled by rhetoric
2282240	2285120	into thinking that one idea is more reasonable than another,
2285120	2286880	and it's even easier to find someone
2286880	2289520	who's willing to tell you that what you think right now
2289520	2291680	is already the reasonable thing.
2291680	2293920	That doesn't make you actually right, though.
2293920	2295840	I'm not a very smart person,
2295840	2298720	and this isn't a self-deprecating joke I'm doing here.
2298720	2300400	Everyone who thinks Dark Souls 2 is bad
2300400	2301760	can attest to this already.
2301760	2303520	I remember once I went to mail a letter
2303520	2305280	and accidentally put the sunglasses
2305280	2307200	in my other hand into the mailbox,
2307200	2309680	and I just tried to quietly erase the memory
2309680	2313440	of watching the sunglasses fade out of view
2313440	2314800	and then drop from my hands
2314800	2317920	as at the very last moment my brain went,
2317920	2318560	hang on.
2318560	2321040	I'm saying this because while humans can be very smart
2321040	2322560	about some things in specific,
2322560	2325600	sometimes humans are, in general,
2325600	2327200	very bad about a lot of things.
2327200	2329600	It's very easy to look at a horizon and say,
2329600	2332080	well, it looks flat to me,
2332080	2334160	or to discount the work of scientists
2334160	2336880	because, well, it just looks a different way to you.
2336880	2338720	And it's very easy to dismiss anyone
2338720	2341280	who might be an authority on an issue as, well,
2341280	2342640	an argument from authority.
2342640	2345840	After all, a PhD is just a piece of paper.
2345840	2348800	It doesn't necessarily mean what that person says is right,
2348800	2351040	and you would be right to assume that,
2351040	2353920	but I also think it's wrong to use that
2353920	2356640	as a deliberate strategy to avoid dealing with the fact
2356640	2359360	that sometimes people do know better than you
2359360	2360640	about complex issues.
2360640	2362480	If you find it easy to discount
2362480	2364640	hundreds of people's life's work
2364640	2366400	because you reckon you know better
2366400	2368880	based on one paper you've read,
2368880	2371520	then you might as well have put your brain in the mailbox.
2371520	2372880	So it turns out there's an advantage
2372880	2374480	to being as rubbish as me.
2374480	2376240	It means you have to put effort into learning things
2376240	2378480	and develop a respect and appreciation
2378480	2380320	for the people who put so much time
2380320	2381360	into learning something
2381360	2384800	and an understanding that maybe they do know more than you.
2384800	2386320	When I find myself disagreeing
2386320	2388400	with the conclusions of a scientist,
2388400	2390960	I ask myself what they might know that I don't
2390960	2393520	and go look for that and see if that changes my mind.
2393520	2396640	And when I find a scientist that I happen to find agreeable,
2396640	2397680	I immediately think,
2397680	2400720	well, if they think like I do, then, well, something's up.
2400720	2402240	Let's see what the others have to say
2402240	2404080	and why they might think they're wrong
2404080	2405280	and what their reasons are.
2405280	2407360	The true test of skepticism
2407360	2410560	isn't in finding ways to debunk your opponents
2410560	2412720	or change anyone else's mind.
2412720	2416400	It's in finding ways to understand when you are wrong
2416400	2418400	and learn to change your mind.
2418400	2420160	Sometimes that's easier than others.
2420160	2421840	For example, in this instance,
2421840	2424240	a lot of people who currently deny climate change
2424800	2427440	can freely admit that they were lied to.
2427440	2430480	They were misled by people who only showed them facts
2430480	2432160	that appeared to confirm their beliefs.
2432800	2435760	They hadn't really thought that hard about it.
2435760	2439120	In fact, their thinking had basically been done for them.
2439120	2441520	They'd given over the thinking to someone else
2441520	2443360	who it turned out they couldn't trust
2443360	2445440	and now they can think for themselves
2445440	2447360	and maybe come to different conclusions.
2447360	2450400	I changed a lot the day I realized
2450400	2452960	that there are people out there who make a living
2452960	2456400	making you feel good for believing what they tell you
2457280	2461840	and, frankly, it gives me hope that that happened to me
2462800	2465200	because I know I'm a foolish person
2465760	2467520	and if I can learn and grow and change
2467520	2468560	then there's hope for all of us
2469600	2471200	and I believe that even you,
2471840	2474400	yes, you, can one day come to accept the truth
2475040	2476720	that horses don't exist.
2477440	2478880	That's what this video is about.
2478880	2479440	Goodbye.
