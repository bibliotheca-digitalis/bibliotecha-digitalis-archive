1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
Are you worried about video game feminists?

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,520
Well now, for the low, low price of $15,000 a month for an undisclosed amount of time,

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,280
you, yes you, can be a part of gaming history and make two dudes have more money than before.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,360
Help Jordan Owen and Devo Sarini afford a new camcorder and maybe some fucking makeup.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,520
She's a professional victim, I tell you.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,160
She fled her home and she's a professional.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Those things are technically, it's technically accurate, goddammit.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
$15,000.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,080
Why would I waste money on a mere feature-length documentary when I can watch Jordan Owen ranting

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,160
on his couch about Anita Sarkeesian for 14 fucking hours for free?

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,040
But now we have to go on the run, the feminists drop Davis in the forest and he doesn't want

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,480
to get dirt on his turtleneck.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,760
Come on Davis, we have to, no, stop lecturing me about ethics, we have to get out of here

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,160
and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
$15,000.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,880
I can't wait to be told what to think by this guy, I mean, he has such amazing thoughts

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,200
about ethnic minorities.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,760
You should be absolutely furious with the niggers, not the blacks, the fucking niggers.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,000
Whites had been working for the past several hundred years to eliminate slavery throughout

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,480
the globe and even when we bought the black slaves, we treated them extremely well.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,880
Oh, of course he has a trilby, of course, why wouldn't he?

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,920
I mean, what else would you hang on your novelty toy skull?

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
$15,000?

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,120
But don't worry though, these guys are totally cool with women, hell, women love them, they

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,800
get plenty of ass.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,160
At the strip club.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,040
And I'll tell you right now, my favourite dancer at my favourite club is Molly at Tattletales.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,560
Go look her up and you'll find out why.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,920
But enough of that bullshit, all this talking about murdering video game women's making

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,880
me Ayn Randi, if you know what I'm fucking saying, that was a pun.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,160
Being befuddled to talk about objectivity, the hottest legs in Atlanta just walked down

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
the sidewalk outside.

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,240
What did the guy they were attached to have to say for himself?

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,440
$15,000 a month.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,000
If Atlas shrugs any harder, he'll fall off his dad's fucking couch.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,120
$11 billion Canadian US dollars.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,360
This should be the kind of thing that people are mobilising over.

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,560
We should be out in the streets, en masse, destroying video game feminism.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, you're really fucking out there right now.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,080
Is that Corinthian leather or did you make it out of all those fucking belts?

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
What?

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Why are there belts in the corner?

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
$15,000.

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,440
David Serrini has a fucking blog.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,680
Oh, sweet.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,520
He's a master of text, not just audio and visuals.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,400
A better class of people hiked up those mountains.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,760
Politics just melt away, leaving a bunch of fat, pasty white guys.

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,440
The colour just melted right off all my black friends that I totally have.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,160
Actually, they didn't want to go hiking with me for some reason.

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,120
On paper, I have nothing against white nationalism.

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,520
I am a huge white nationalist on paper.

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,760
This guy knows exactly what women are like.

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,080
Women in our culture have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,040
Going out for gang bangs every weekend and despising the men that would actually treat

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
them with love, dignity and respect.

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
$15,000.

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,840
But enough about women, let's do some Bible study.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,520
So, a series of videos on theology.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,160
I don't think these are going to be the most popular videos I ever record.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,920
Not the plastic fucking niggers.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,560
So it starts out, Eve allows herself to be tricked by the serpent.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Any of you men out there with experience with women, know that women are so prone to this.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
They want to be seen.

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,760
The Bible, the number one authoritative source on women.

66
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,600
Oh my god.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Oh my god.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Holy shit.

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
It just keeps...

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Holy fucking...

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
$15,000.

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:22,080
Don't get him started on Karl Marx, a guy who's worked, he's totally red.

73
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,000
You see it with the Marxists.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
The Marxists say the capitalist class stole all the money.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,640
So we're going to go burn down their houses and rape their children and torture them and

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,240
hang them and take their property, then we'll have a socialist utopia.

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,480
He knows, he knows, he knows.

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,720
$15,000.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,280
My opinion is so expensive that wearing normal clothes wouldn't do it justice.

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,440
If you give me $15,000, I'll be able to make a suit out of money and that will justify

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
my opinion.

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Okay, fuck it.

83
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,280
I'll watch one more of these and then I'm just going to forget these guys.

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Hold on a second.

85
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,840
Is he playing the Sims while he..

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Holy f...

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
What.

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
What the fuck.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
What?!

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
What?

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
How many of those do you...

92
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
He moves it between shots.

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
He just keeps...

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Oh my fu...

95
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
I'm crying.

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
I'm dying.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
I'm dying.

98
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Holy fuck.

99
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm dying.

100
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Holy fuck.

101
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I'm dying.

102
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Holy fuck.

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm dying.

104
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
I'm dying.

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Holy fuck.

106
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Holy fuck.

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm dying.

108
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
What the fuck?

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
What?

110
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
What?

111
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
What?

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
What?

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
What?

114
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
What?

115
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm dying.

116
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm dying.

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm dying.

118
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
I'm dying.

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm dying.

120
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
I'm dying.

121
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm dying.

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I'm dying.

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm dying.

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm dying.

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm dying.

126
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm dying.

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm dying.

128
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
I'm dying.

129
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm dying.

130
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I feel like I should say something at least semi-serious in this if people are going to

131
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
end up watching this.

132
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,840
In one of his videos, David Sorini openly admits that whenever he says anything that

133
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,140
sounds even vaguely progressive, he gets a bunch of shit off of white nationalists.

134
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,820
Like, they see him saying something that's not pro-white people, and they get pissy with

135
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,820
him.

136
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,740
Obviously, this is a terrible thing, and the people who do that are the worst kind of scum,

137
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,020
but the real question is why so many white nationalists watch his videos in the first

138
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
place?

139
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,540
Like, have you considered that maybe you're attracting the wrong audience when you talk

140
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,580
about how bad black people are, or women in general?

141
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
Come on now.

142
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,940
I actually, like, watched through some of that stuff, so I could make some kind of long-winded

143
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:37,740
fucking 40-minute rebuttal, but all I could f- it- all you can do is laugh.

144
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,340
You don't- you don't need to bother, like, it's-

145
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,940
I can't- I can't believe there's fucking skulls all over the place.

146
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,260
I hope it's not real.

147
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,140
Oh my god, is it real?
