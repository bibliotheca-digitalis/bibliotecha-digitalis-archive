1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ah.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,640
You know, if there's one thing the Internet needs,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,000
it's about 20 to 30 more hot takes on why the new Ghostbusters no one's seen is bad.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Oh, hey, what's this?

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,480
That's a David Serrini video.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,640
I said I wouldn't do any more stuff about him because people who focus on the same thing over and over are really weird,

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,640
you know?

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:33,140
You know, I just realized I am really weird. Plus, I've been looking for an excuse to open the vodka.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,560
As they say in Russia,

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Na zdorovie, eschews.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:00,800
That's right, when he's not busy diagnosing his former business partners with serial killer or acting entitled to other old writers as they try to distance themselves from him,

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,800
David Serrini has some deep analytical thoughts about a Ghostbusters film he hasn't seen.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I wonder what amazing insights he'll bring to the table. Let's check it out, shall we?

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,800
The problem with Ghostbusters 2016 is that the main cast is all female.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
You've gotta love the guy's honesty.

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,800
The reason Ghostbusters doesn't work with a female cast is because at the core, it is a male story.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Yeah, only men can hunt for ghosts. I'm sure he's about to justify this.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Now I'd like to step back for a moment.

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
No, he just leaves it hanging. Okay.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Davis then goes into detail about how the term strong female character is a misnomer because women are less physically strong than men.

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Strength, physical strength, is one of the defining aspects of masculinity.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
When you contrast the sexes, there's no contest.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Ignoring for a moment that the Ghostbusters' physical strength has never been one of their central characteristics.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
In fact, they're mostly characterized as science nerds.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
I collect spores, molds, and fungus.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
The average man is stronger than 95% of women.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,800
This is why I find the phrase strong female characters so interesting.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,800
It sets women up to fail, competing in an arena where men are the superior sex.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
And as we all know, that's the only definition of strong there is.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
There's no alternative meanings.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Dictionaries are part of the reptilian agenda to make people understand what words mean.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Or it requires that they be empowered by the director, who winds up giving superhuman abilities to 120-pound Scarlett Johansson.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
This results in cognitive dissonance for the audience.

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
That's right, cognitive dissonance.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Davis has finally done it.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,800
After years of testing, he's finally found the most unbelievable, unrealistic member of the Avengers.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
The woman.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,800
And as we know, presenting women as strong and good at fighting is a recipe only for box office disaster.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
See? She's weak.

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,800
So she, like all weak fools, has to compensate by using a gun.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Someone who's strong is someone who's powerful.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
But strength isn't the only form of power.

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
In Game of Thrones, neither Tyrion nor Varys are strong physically.

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,800
And yet both of them are powerful and admirable despite physical weakness.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Ah, I see. Davis finally recognizes that the term strong has multiple meanings.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
You can be strong without being physically strong.

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
But wait a second.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
If you don't have to be physically strong to be strong, why do you have to be male?

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Men are good at some things.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Women are good at different things.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
What are women good at?

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Davis doesn't say here, but I think he addressed this in his Star Wars article.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Women bleed on the birthing bed.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
This short documentary is pretty hilariously self-defeating,

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
but it's not quite perfect because it's mostly still images

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,800
interspersed with footage borrowed from someone else's music video.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
It's lacking what most of the rest of his videos have,

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
namely a long, uncut shot of Davis gesticulating to the camera

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
while pretending to sip his whiskey every time he thinks he's made a hot take

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
or needs to stop to think of what he's going to say next.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Why is it a problem now?

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
For someone who manages to never go 30 seconds without taking a sip,

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
he doesn't seem to actually consume much of it.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I've pointed this out before, but it's a truly amazing talent.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
You'd think you'd absorb some through osmosis

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
if you touch it with your lips constantly for 20 minutes,

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
but no, this is just how real manly men drink alcohol.

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
By not drinking it.

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm a big boy now.

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
And maybe I'm crossing a cultural boundary here,

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,800
but who puts four or five huge pieces of ice in a nice whiskey like that?

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
That completely removes the taste and the aroma.

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
You might as well be drinking water.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
So let's return to Ghostbusters.

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
The real Ghostbusters.

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Oh, yeah!

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Oh, man, I love the real Ghostbusters.

78
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
It was my favorite show when I was growing up.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I was born a year after it went off the air,

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
but I've been nostalgic for other people's childhoods my whole life.

81
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Oh.

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
No, he just made a very poor choice of words

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
when describing the original Ghostbusters film.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Oh, okay. Fine.

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
What's this movie really about?

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
When you strip away all of the makeup,

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,800
the setting, the ghosts, the gags, and the big-name actors...

88
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
If you ignore everything about the film,

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
apart from the fact the main characters are male,

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
then Ghostbusters is about being a man.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Beat that, feminists!

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
What is the kernel of narrative that you find?

93
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
It's a movie about four friends putting together a small business

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
and the difficulties they have to deal with.

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
This is a masculine story at its core.

96
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
He doesn't even say what made the original film good.

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
He openly admits he's ignoring everything about the film

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
except the physical sex of the principal characters,

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
then makes a vague statement about the story

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
being about four friends starting a business together.

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
That isn't even accurate, either.

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
The film's about three friends starting a business,

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
and Winston is a new recruit they hire later,

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
so even his summary of the original film is wrong.

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
But based on this reductive, misremembered plot outline,

106
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
he then concludes that this premise simply could not work if there were women.

107
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Women don't start businesses.

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
The reason it's a masculine story

109
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,800
is because of the psychological inheritance we received from our ancestors.

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Men evolved to go out and prove themselves to women,

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
to take big risks, to bite off more than they can chew.

112
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Women evolved to find security in the home environment

113
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
so that they could raise their children successfully.

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Of course it's about having children!

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
That's what women are for, am I right, guys?

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
So did the men.

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Because of this, our ancestors were the risk-taking men

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
who would do something like gamble on Ghostbusting

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Ghostbusting being a successful business model.

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Therefore, we weren't evolved to be Ghostbusters, Davis!

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Ghosts do not exist!

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Etsy, what?!

123
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Women were evolved for Etsy!

124
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
And men were evolved to be Ghostbusters!

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
...reasons for this.

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Reasons that are so obvious I won't even...

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
But when it comes to Ghostbusting...

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
...undermines the conflict.

129
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
We're gonna go back.

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Ghosts and magic nuclear proton packs I can suspend my disbelief about,

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
but WOMs opening a ghost-hunting business?

132
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Come on!

133
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Where'd you study evolutionary biology, Davis?

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
The university of your own mind?

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Roosh Legalize Rape V's Internet Forum?

136
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Now, I'm sure that's my academic bias.

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
You don't have to have a degree to know this stuff.

138
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm sure he cites his sources to support the idea

139
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
that running a business is an evolutionarily male thing in the descri...

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
No, he doesn't. He just links to his Twitter.

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Gosh, he's so rational.

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
He's a true free thinker.

143
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
He's free from having to provide evidence or reasoning for his claims.

144
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Davis has always had a devil-may-care attitude

145
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
to proving his point using evidence.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
In a previous video where he claims women are depressed because of feminism,

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
he cites precisely one source,

148
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
which links to a dead page,

149
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
prompting you to have to Google it for him,

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
and eventually discovering it doesn't say what he says it says.

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
So, even when he does cite his sources,

152
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
you have to go out of your way to find them

153
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
just to realize he's making it up.

154
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Davis then goes on to diagnose Paul Feig,

155
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
a successful and critically acclaimed millionaire film director

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
who's done more than Davis ever will,

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
with some kind of weird mother complex?

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
It is clear that Feig is a man who's deeply confused about the sexes.

159
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
He never learned about masculinity from a father who was always working.

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
He was a boy raised to be a woman.

161
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
If you don't agree with me, you have a mental disorder.

162
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
He claims that Feig is just projecting his beliefs onto the world.

163
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
He takes his malformed, stunted understanding of masculinity

164
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
and projects it onto the other sex.

165
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Wow, the man literally fantasizes about everyone not like him being completely crazy.

166
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
And when he's not doing that, he's accusing them of projecting.

167
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,800
In fact, he makes this kind of claim all the time with people he doesn't like.

168
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
She's projecting. He's projecting. You're projecting.

169
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
That's right, Davis. Everyone's projecting.

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
They manufactured a problem to be upset with.

171
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
He's just constantly finding problems to bitch about

172
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
that only he can find the solution for.

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Estu really is a mental disorder, and you're a part of it.

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Remember when he kept comparing Jordan Owen to Elliot Rodger

175
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
just because they had a slight argument?

176
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
By the way, it's not a good look to openly admit you work with people

177
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
who even you think have the makings of a violent outburst.

178
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
In another interview with Hollywood Reporter,

179
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
he made a point of saying that his favorite color was purple.

180
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Oh, the color purple, am I right, guys?

181
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Clearly the man's deranged. Might as well lock him up right now.

182
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Davis loves to diagnose people with made-up problems

183
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
in order to then prescribe his own ideal solution.

184
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Looking back through the article where he shills for testosterone cream

185
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
the company Andro Plus gave him for free,

186
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Davis diagnoses the entire male sex in the modern day

187
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
of having an epidemic of low testosterone.

188
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,800
His main point of evidence being your own eyes,

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
or rather, his personal opinion.

190
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
The world is sick, and the cure is this topical cream

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I was given for free by my sponsors.

192
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
To be fair, though, he does give recommendations

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
for natural solutions to men's lack of testosterone.

194
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
One, fix your diet.

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Three, work out.

196
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Two, supplements.

197
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Four, lifestyle.

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Seven, proofread your fucking article!

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Hey, shilling for this testosterone cream stuff

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
sounds like a nice racket.

201
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
That's why I've decided to get in on that business.

202
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Are you living in constant fear

203
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
of losing your one source of pride,

204
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
your hashtag manliness,

205
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
worried you'll lose your sex partner to someone

206
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
with a greater libido or who's nicer?

207
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Are you embarrassed by the male pattern boldness

208
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
that combined with your shitty philosophy

209
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
causes everyone to keep comparing you to Kane

210
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
from Command & Conquer?

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Or are you just looking to get conned out of money

212
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
by people who know how to play on your insecurities?

213
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Well, new from Oxymoron Productions,

214
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
it's Manestroni.

215
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
It'll make you feel like the fictionalized version

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
of man you think exists.

217
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Man-spread some on your toast today.

218
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Or if you're trying to cut down

219
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
on the unnecessary bread-carb-gluten-tootins,

220
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
just pour it directly into your gaping mouth hole,

221
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
you decadent slut!

222
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Finally, manhood.

223
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Mwah!

224
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Manestroni.

225
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
It's not sponsored by Davis Aurini.

226
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
It can be yours for the extortionate price

227
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
of $15,000 a month.

228
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
In fact, at one point,

229
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
rather than quote the actual feminists

230
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
he's trying to criticize,

231
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
he quotes the villain of Ayn Rand's

232
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
The Fountainhead and says,

233
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
eh, they're basically just like that.

234
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Taking this in consideration

235
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
with his poor and reductive understanding

236
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
of the re- I mean, original Ghostbusters

237
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
and his admission that he didn't actually watch

238
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
most of Anita Sarkeesian's work

239
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
when he made a documentary about her,

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
something very clear unfolds.

241
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Davis is just making shit up.

242
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
The reason he cites no sources

243
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
except ones that contradict him

244
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
and talks only in vague statements

245
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
about every subject he's ever covered

246
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
is because he doesn't actually engage

247
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,800
with any of the material he's discussing at all.

248
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
The only people he ever consistently cites

249
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
or quotes in detail

250
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
are people he already agrees with

251
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,800
from his personal corner of the manosphere,

252
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
and even then, that list changes over time

253
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
as more and more of them reject him.

254
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
You might notice that Davis' overall style

255
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
has altered a little,

256
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
and I'm not just saying he's finally become ashamed

257
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
of poor old MacArthur and hidden him.

258
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
In previous videos and articles,

259
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Davis wouldn't censor himself.

260
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
He would be quick to point out

261
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
that women are the real cause of the world's problems,

262
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
and they need to be forced to submit.

263
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
But now he's saying women are good at some things.

264
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
He doesn't say what exactly

265
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
besides having children,

266
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
keeping a house clean,

267
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
and running an Etsy store,

268
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
but that's at least progress.

269
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
He's no longer claiming their sole purpose

270
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
is to bleed on the birthing bed,

271
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
which brings me to the question of the day.

272
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Has our good friend Davey Wavey

273
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
actually improved as a person

274
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
in the time since I last looked at his stuff,

275
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
or has he simply learned how to cloak his beliefs

276
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
behind slightly more coded language?

277
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I'll let you decide.

278
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
But it's the latter,

279
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
and if you disagree, you're wrong.

280
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
On some days, Davis will diagnose people he's never met

281
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
with a whole heap of mental disorders

282
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
from the safety and complacency of his literal armchair,

283
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
and then on others,

284
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
he'll tell you that psychiatrists

285
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
just make problems up and none exist.

286
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Well, someone is.

287
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
You know, 60 years ago,

288
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
the people we now refer to as neoreactionaries

289
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
were the mainstream, the actionaries,

290
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
saying that women really shouldn't be

291
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
in any kind of working roles

292
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
and pointing to the fact that there weren't any

293
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
and asking,

294
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
have you seen any women doing good jobs lately?

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
But then women started working

296
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
and proved that they were just as good slaves

297
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
to the capitalist nightmare as men,

298
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
and that whole argument went out the window.

299
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Nowadays, we call them neoreactionaries,

300
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
and they mostly just make shitty documentaries

301
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
barely anyone watches

302
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
about the misandry in Bioshock

303
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
or films they haven't seen yet.

304
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Occasionally, they go out to their car or the woods

305
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
to film themselves diagnosing

306
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
far more successful men than them

307
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
that they haven't met with mental disorders

308
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
so they can feel better about how their ideas have failed them.

309
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
I call that progress.

310
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I could tell you that I don't like Davis,

311
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
that he's a bad guy and needs to be stopped,

312
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
but the honest reality is I like him very much.

313
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
He's hilarious.

314
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
He's provided me with hours of amazing content

315
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
that I can't stop watching.

316
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
His petulant, incoherent whining

317
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
and the air of mirth with which he's received,

318
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
even by his own guys,

319
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
and it is mostly guys,

320
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
will never stop being funny to me.

321
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
And Davis?

322
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Please never ever stop.

323
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Please continue writing free associative rants

324
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
on your website for me to read and enjoy.

325
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
And please don't go outside too much,

326
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
because if you meet too many feminists

327
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
who you can have a real conversation with,

328
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
you might change your mind on some points,

329
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
and then I would lose a source of comedy.

330
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
That said, I know in my heart you will come around one day.

331
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
We'll kill you with kindness,

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
and your ghost will be a feminist.

333
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
That wasn't a threat.

334
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
That was a metaphor.

335
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Look,

336
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
the people on your side might hate you

337
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
for making them all look bad

338
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
and question your masculinity

339
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,800
through your constant need to stock up on testosterone cream,

340
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
but you'll always be my man, Davis.

341
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Here's to you.

342
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Cheers.

343
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
You'll notice I only use one piece of ice,

344
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,800
because I'm already cool enough.

345
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I'd like to say an extra special thanks,

346
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
in no particular order except alphabetical,

347
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
to...

348
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Casey Schnabel,

349
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Kieran,

350
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
David Rose,

351
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
