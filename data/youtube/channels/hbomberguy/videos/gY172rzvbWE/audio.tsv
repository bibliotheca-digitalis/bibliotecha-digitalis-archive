0	2000	Ah.
2640	4640	You know, if there's one thing the Internet needs,
4680	10000	it's about 20 to 30 more hot takes on why the new Ghostbusters no one's seen is bad.
10500	12500	Oh, hey, what's this?
14920	16480	That's a David Serrini video.
16480	21640	I said I wouldn't do any more stuff about him because people who focus on the same thing over and over are really weird,
21640	23640	you know?
23640	33140	You know, I just realized I am really weird. Plus, I've been looking for an excuse to open the vodka.
43560	45560	As they say in Russia,
46800	48800	Na zdorovie, eschews.
48800	60800	That's right, when he's not busy diagnosing his former business partners with serial killer or acting entitled to other old writers as they try to distance themselves from him,
60800	65800	David Serrini has some deep analytical thoughts about a Ghostbusters film he hasn't seen.
65800	69800	I wonder what amazing insights he'll bring to the table. Let's check it out, shall we?
69800	76800	The problem with Ghostbusters 2016 is that the main cast is all female.
77800	80800	You've gotta love the guy's honesty.
80800	88800	The reason Ghostbusters doesn't work with a female cast is because at the core, it is a male story.
88800	92800	Yeah, only men can hunt for ghosts. I'm sure he's about to justify this.
92800	94800	Now I'd like to step back for a moment.
94800	96800	No, he just leaves it hanging. Okay.
96800	103800	Davis then goes into detail about how the term strong female character is a misnomer because women are less physically strong than men.
103800	109800	Strength, physical strength, is one of the defining aspects of masculinity.
109800	112800	When you contrast the sexes, there's no contest.
112800	117800	Ignoring for a moment that the Ghostbusters' physical strength has never been one of their central characteristics.
117800	120800	In fact, they're mostly characterized as science nerds.
120800	122800	I collect spores, molds, and fungus.
122800	125800	The average man is stronger than 95% of women.
125800	130800	This is why I find the phrase strong female characters so interesting.
130800	135800	It sets women up to fail, competing in an arena where men are the superior sex.
135800	138800	And as we all know, that's the only definition of strong there is.
138800	140800	There's no alternative meanings.
140800	144800	Dictionaries are part of the reptilian agenda to make people understand what words mean.
144800	154800	Or it requires that they be empowered by the director, who winds up giving superhuman abilities to 120-pound Scarlett Johansson.
154800	158800	This results in cognitive dissonance for the audience.
159800	161800	That's right, cognitive dissonance.
161800	163800	Davis has finally done it.
163800	169800	After years of testing, he's finally found the most unbelievable, unrealistic member of the Avengers.
169800	170800	The woman.
170800	176800	And as we know, presenting women as strong and good at fighting is a recipe only for box office disaster.
179800	181800	See? She's weak.
181800	185800	So she, like all weak fools, has to compensate by using a gun.
186800	189800	Someone who's strong is someone who's powerful.
189800	192800	But strength isn't the only form of power.
192800	196800	In Game of Thrones, neither Tyrion nor Varys are strong physically.
196800	201800	And yet both of them are powerful and admirable despite physical weakness.
201800	205800	Ah, I see. Davis finally recognizes that the term strong has multiple meanings.
205800	208800	You can be strong without being physically strong.
208800	210800	But wait a second.
210800	214800	If you don't have to be physically strong to be strong, why do you have to be male?
214800	216800	Men are good at some things.
216800	218800	Women are good at different things.
218800	219800	What are women good at?
219800	223800	Davis doesn't say here, but I think he addressed this in his Star Wars article.
223800	225800	Women bleed on the birthing bed.
225800	228800	This short documentary is pretty hilariously self-defeating,
228800	231800	but it's not quite perfect because it's mostly still images
231800	235800	interspersed with footage borrowed from someone else's music video.
235800	237800	It's lacking what most of the rest of his videos have,
237800	241800	namely a long, uncut shot of Davis gesticulating to the camera
241800	244800	while pretending to sip his whiskey every time he thinks he's made a hot take
244800	247800	or needs to stop to think of what he's going to say next.
247800	249800	Why is it a problem now?
253800	257800	For someone who manages to never go 30 seconds without taking a sip,
257800	259800	he doesn't seem to actually consume much of it.
259800	262800	I've pointed this out before, but it's a truly amazing talent.
262800	264800	You'd think you'd absorb some through osmosis
264800	267800	if you touch it with your lips constantly for 20 minutes,
267800	271800	but no, this is just how real manly men drink alcohol.
271800	273800	By not drinking it.
273800	275800	I'm a big boy now.
275800	277800	And maybe I'm crossing a cultural boundary here,
277800	282800	but who puts four or five huge pieces of ice in a nice whiskey like that?
282800	284800	That completely removes the taste and the aroma.
284800	286800	You might as well be drinking water.
286800	288800	So let's return to Ghostbusters.
288800	290800	The real Ghostbusters.
290800	292800	Oh, yeah!
293800	295800	Oh, man, I love the real Ghostbusters.
295800	297800	It was my favorite show when I was growing up.
297800	299800	I was born a year after it went off the air,
299800	302800	but I've been nostalgic for other people's childhoods my whole life.
303800	304800	Oh.
305800	307800	No, he just made a very poor choice of words
307800	309800	when describing the original Ghostbusters film.
309800	310800	Oh, okay. Fine.
310800	313800	What's this movie really about?
313800	315800	When you strip away all of the makeup,
315800	319800	the setting, the ghosts, the gags, and the big-name actors...
319800	321800	If you ignore everything about the film,
321800	323800	apart from the fact the main characters are male,
323800	325800	then Ghostbusters is about being a man.
325800	327800	Beat that, feminists!
327800	330800	What is the kernel of narrative that you find?
332800	335800	It's a movie about four friends putting together a small business
335800	338800	and the difficulties they have to deal with.
338800	341800	This is a masculine story at its core.
341800	344800	He doesn't even say what made the original film good.
344800	347800	He openly admits he's ignoring everything about the film
347800	350800	except the physical sex of the principal characters,
350800	352800	then makes a vague statement about the story
352800	355800	being about four friends starting a business together.
355800	356800	That isn't even accurate, either.
356800	358800	The film's about three friends starting a business,
358800	361800	and Winston is a new recruit they hire later,
361800	364800	so even his summary of the original film is wrong.
364800	367800	But based on this reductive, misremembered plot outline,
367800	371800	he then concludes that this premise simply could not work if there were women.
371800	373800	Women don't start businesses.
373800	375800	The reason it's a masculine story
375800	380800	is because of the psychological inheritance we received from our ancestors.
380800	383800	Men evolved to go out and prove themselves to women,
383800	386800	to take big risks, to bite off more than they can chew.
386800	389800	Women evolved to find security in the home environment
389800	392800	so that they could raise their children successfully.
392800	394800	Of course it's about having children!
394800	396800	That's what women are for, am I right, guys?
396800	397800	So did the men.
397800	400800	Because of this, our ancestors were the risk-taking men
400800	403800	who would do something like gamble on Ghostbusting
403800	405800	Ghostbusting being a successful business model.
405800	408800	Therefore, we weren't evolved to be Ghostbusters, Davis!
408800	410800	Ghosts do not exist!
411800	413800	Etsy, what?!
420800	422800	Women were evolved for Etsy!
422800	425800	And men were evolved to be Ghostbusters!
425800	426800	...reasons for this.
426800	428800	Reasons that are so obvious I won't even...
430800	432800	But when it comes to Ghostbusting...
432800	434800	...undermines the conflict.
434800	436800	We're gonna go back.
436800	440800	Ghosts and magic nuclear proton packs I can suspend my disbelief about,
440800	443800	but WOMs opening a ghost-hunting business?
443800	444800	Come on!
444800	446800	Where'd you study evolutionary biology, Davis?
446800	448800	The university of your own mind?
448800	451800	Roosh Legalize Rape V's Internet Forum?
451800	453800	Now, I'm sure that's my academic bias.
453800	455800	You don't have to have a degree to know this stuff.
455800	457800	I'm sure he cites his sources to support the idea
457800	460800	that running a business is an evolutionarily male thing in the descri...
460800	462800	No, he doesn't. He just links to his Twitter.
462800	464800	Gosh, he's so rational.
464800	465800	He's a true free thinker.
465800	469800	He's free from having to provide evidence or reasoning for his claims.
469800	472800	Davis has always had a devil-may-care attitude
472800	474800	to proving his point using evidence.
474800	477800	In a previous video where he claims women are depressed because of feminism,
477800	479800	he cites precisely one source,
479800	481800	which links to a dead page,
481800	482800	prompting you to have to Google it for him,
482800	485800	and eventually discovering it doesn't say what he says it says.
485800	487800	So, even when he does cite his sources,
487800	489800	you have to go out of your way to find them
489800	491800	just to realize he's making it up.
491800	493800	Davis then goes on to diagnose Paul Feig,
493800	496800	a successful and critically acclaimed millionaire film director
496800	498800	who's done more than Davis ever will,
498800	500800	with some kind of weird mother complex?
500800	504800	It is clear that Feig is a man who's deeply confused about the sexes.
504800	508800	He never learned about masculinity from a father who was always working.
508800	510800	He was a boy raised to be a woman.
510800	513800	If you don't agree with me, you have a mental disorder.
513800	516800	He claims that Feig is just projecting his beliefs onto the world.
516800	520800	He takes his malformed, stunted understanding of masculinity
520800	522800	and projects it onto the other sex.
522800	528800	Wow, the man literally fantasizes about everyone not like him being completely crazy.
528800	531800	And when he's not doing that, he's accusing them of projecting.
531800	534800	In fact, he makes this kind of claim all the time with people he doesn't like.
534800	538800	She's projecting. He's projecting. You're projecting.
539800	542800	That's right, Davis. Everyone's projecting.
542800	546800	They manufactured a problem to be upset with.
546800	550800	He's just constantly finding problems to bitch about
550800	552800	that only he can find the solution for.
552800	556800	Estu really is a mental disorder, and you're a part of it.
556800	559800	Remember when he kept comparing Jordan Owen to Elliot Rodger
559800	561800	just because they had a slight argument?
561800	564800	By the way, it's not a good look to openly admit you work with people
564800	567800	who even you think have the makings of a violent outburst.
567800	569800	In another interview with Hollywood Reporter,
569800	572800	he made a point of saying that his favorite color was purple.
574800	576800	Oh, the color purple, am I right, guys?
576800	579800	Clearly the man's deranged. Might as well lock him up right now.
579800	582800	Davis loves to diagnose people with made-up problems
582800	584800	in order to then prescribe his own ideal solution.
584800	587800	Looking back through the article where he shills for testosterone cream
587800	589800	the company Andro Plus gave him for free,
590800	593800	Davis diagnoses the entire male sex in the modern day
593800	596800	of having an epidemic of low testosterone.
596800	599800	His main point of evidence being your own eyes,
599800	601800	or rather, his personal opinion.
601800	604800	The world is sick, and the cure is this topical cream
604800	606800	I was given for free by my sponsors.
606800	609800	To be fair, though, he does give recommendations
609800	612800	for natural solutions to men's lack of testosterone.
612800	614800	One, fix your diet.
614800	616800	Three, work out.
616800	618800	Two, supplements.
618800	620800	Four, lifestyle.
620800	622800	Seven, proofread your fucking article!
622800	624800	Hey, shilling for this testosterone cream stuff
624800	625800	sounds like a nice racket.
625800	628800	That's why I've decided to get in on that business.
628800	630800	Are you living in constant fear
630800	632800	of losing your one source of pride,
632800	634800	your hashtag manliness,
634800	636800	worried you'll lose your sex partner to someone
636800	639800	with a greater libido or who's nicer?
639800	641800	Are you embarrassed by the male pattern boldness
641800	643800	that combined with your shitty philosophy
643800	645800	causes everyone to keep comparing you to Kane
645800	646800	from Command & Conquer?
646800	648800	Or are you just looking to get conned out of money
648800	651800	by people who know how to play on your insecurities?
651800	653800	Well, new from Oxymoron Productions,
653800	654800	it's Manestroni.
654800	656800	It'll make you feel like the fictionalized version
656800	658800	of man you think exists.
658800	660800	Man-spread some on your toast today.
663800	664800	Or if you're trying to cut down
664800	667800	on the unnecessary bread-carb-gluten-tootins,
667800	669800	just pour it directly into your gaping mouth hole,
669800	672800	you decadent slut!
672800	675800	Finally, manhood.
675800	676800	Mwah!
676800	677800	Manestroni.
677800	680800	It's not sponsored by Davis Aurini.
681800	683800	It can be yours for the extortionate price
683800	686800	of $15,000 a month.
686800	687800	In fact, at one point,
687800	689800	rather than quote the actual feminists
689800	691800	he's trying to criticize,
691800	693800	he quotes the villain of Ayn Rand's
693800	695800	The Fountainhead and says,
695800	697800	eh, they're basically just like that.
697800	698800	Taking this in consideration
698800	700800	with his poor and reductive understanding
700800	703800	of the re- I mean, original Ghostbusters
703800	705800	and his admission that he didn't actually watch
705800	707800	most of Anita Sarkeesian's work
707800	709800	when he made a documentary about her,
709800	712800	something very clear unfolds.
712800	714800	Davis is just making shit up.
714800	716800	The reason he cites no sources
716800	717800	except ones that contradict him
717800	719800	and talks only in vague statements
719800	721800	about every subject he's ever covered
721800	722800	is because he doesn't actually engage
722800	725800	with any of the material he's discussing at all.
725800	727800	The only people he ever consistently cites
727800	728800	or quotes in detail
728800	730800	are people he already agrees with
730800	733800	from his personal corner of the manosphere,
733800	735800	and even then, that list changes over time
735800	737800	as more and more of them reject him.
737800	739800	You might notice that Davis' overall style
739800	740800	has altered a little,
740800	742800	and I'm not just saying he's finally become ashamed
742800	744800	of poor old MacArthur and hidden him.
744800	745800	In previous videos and articles,
745800	747800	Davis wouldn't censor himself.
747800	748800	He would be quick to point out
748800	750800	that women are the real cause of the world's problems,
750800	753800	and they need to be forced to submit.
753800	755800	But now he's saying women are good at some things.
755800	757800	He doesn't say what exactly
757800	759800	besides having children,
759800	760800	keeping a house clean,
760800	762800	and running an Etsy store,
762800	764800	but that's at least progress.
764800	765800	He's no longer claiming their sole purpose
765800	768800	is to bleed on the birthing bed,
768800	770800	which brings me to the question of the day.
770800	771800	Has our good friend Davey Wavey
771800	773800	actually improved as a person
773800	775800	in the time since I last looked at his stuff,
775800	778800	or has he simply learned how to cloak his beliefs
778800	780800	behind slightly more coded language?
780800	782800	I'll let you decide.
783800	784800	But it's the latter,
784800	786800	and if you disagree, you're wrong.
790800	793800	On some days, Davis will diagnose people he's never met
793800	794800	with a whole heap of mental disorders
794800	798800	from the safety and complacency of his literal armchair,
798800	799800	and then on others,
799800	801800	he'll tell you that psychiatrists
801800	804800	just make problems up and none exist.
804800	806800	Well, someone is.
806800	808800	You know, 60 years ago,
808800	810800	the people we now refer to as neoreactionaries
810800	812800	were the mainstream, the actionaries,
812800	815800	saying that women really shouldn't be
815800	816800	in any kind of working roles
816800	818800	and pointing to the fact that there weren't any
818800	819800	and asking,
819800	821800	have you seen any women doing good jobs lately?
821800	823800	But then women started working
823800	825800	and proved that they were just as good slaves
825800	827800	to the capitalist nightmare as men,
827800	829800	and that whole argument went out the window.
830800	832800	Nowadays, we call them neoreactionaries,
832800	835800	and they mostly just make shitty documentaries
835800	836800	barely anyone watches
836800	839800	about the misandry in Bioshock
839800	842800	or films they haven't seen yet.
842800	845800	Occasionally, they go out to their car or the woods
845800	846800	to film themselves diagnosing
846800	848800	far more successful men than them
848800	850800	that they haven't met with mental disorders
850800	853800	so they can feel better about how their ideas have failed them.
853800	855800	I call that progress.
856800	858800	I could tell you that I don't like Davis,
858800	861800	that he's a bad guy and needs to be stopped,
861800	864800	but the honest reality is I like him very much.
864800	865800	He's hilarious.
865800	868800	He's provided me with hours of amazing content
868800	870800	that I can't stop watching.
870800	872800	His petulant, incoherent whining
872800	874800	and the air of mirth with which he's received,
874800	875800	even by his own guys,
875800	877800	and it is mostly guys,
877800	879800	will never stop being funny to me.
879800	881800	And Davis?
881800	883800	Please never ever stop.
883800	886800	Please continue writing free associative rants
886800	888800	on your website for me to read and enjoy.
888800	891800	And please don't go outside too much,
891800	893800	because if you meet too many feminists
893800	894800	who you can have a real conversation with,
894800	896800	you might change your mind on some points,
896800	898800	and then I would lose a source of comedy.
898800	902800	That said, I know in my heart you will come around one day.
902800	904800	We'll kill you with kindness,
904800	906800	and your ghost will be a feminist.
907800	909800	That wasn't a threat.
909800	911800	That was a metaphor.
911800	913800	Look,
913800	916800	the people on your side might hate you
916800	917800	for making them all look bad
917800	919800	and question your masculinity
919800	923800	through your constant need to stock up on testosterone cream,
923800	926800	but you'll always be my man, Davis.
926800	928800	Here's to you.
928800	929800	Cheers.
933800	935800	You'll notice I only use one piece of ice,
935800	938800	because I'm already cool enough.
951800	953800	I'd like to say an extra special thanks,
953800	955800	in no particular order except alphabetical,
955800	956800	to...
965800	966800	Casey Schnabel,
966800	967800	Kieran,
967800	968800	David Rose,
968800	969800	Gorkham Gadduck,
969800	971800	and Instant Grat.
971800	973800	For a donation of only $2,
973800	976800	DDSU can see outtakes like this one.
976800	979800	Ha ha!
979800	981800	What a terrible shot!
981800	982800	I'm awful at this.
