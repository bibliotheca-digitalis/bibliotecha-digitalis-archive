1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
Oh, I'm definitely not going to get this video finished on time.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,520
Happy holidays, friends, enemies, frenemies and splenemies.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:45,440
Paris Bomberguy here, and I'll see you in the next video.

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,140
Okay, right, I can explain.

5
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,040
I recorded the Halloween segment of that video

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,280
as a funny joke about how it takes me a while

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,400
to make videos, and then I actually missed last Christmas.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,520
So here we are in the apocalypse.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,760
Let's all watch last year's Christmas video.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,740
This year, now that it's done,

11
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,640
this means I technically got a seasonal video out on time,

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,400
which means I'm good at my job.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,740
Fuck you.

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm just chilling out here in my house,

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,180
enjoying the best that the clearance aisle had to offer.

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,080
This Fortnite Funko Pop Tower Recon Specialist.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay, this tasteful Coraline mug

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,000
you can drink out of Coraline's head.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Start off your morning routine with Coraline.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,440
Uh, not dishwasher or microwave safe.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,440
And this friend's makeup set where every color

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,440
is a reference to a show that ended 15 years ago.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,120
Fukuyama was right.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,800
History ended in 2004 when Rachel got off the plane.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,200
And yes, I'm actually going to give this as a gift

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,560
at my family's secret Santa this year.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,280
I guess you know who got you your gift, Luke.

28
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,800
I hope you've seen friends.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,400
I also hope you'll stop being such a Ross.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,160
Ah, but the sad thing is,

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,760
when I give my family these gifts,

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,160
which are as good as they deserve, on Christmas Day,

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,720
I won't even be allowed to say Merry Christmas as I do it

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,040
because of the liberal, communist, atheist conspiracy

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,600
to destroy the Christian religion by eroding its traditions.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,160
Political correctness, whoever that is,

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,640
literally says it's racist to say Christmas now.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,000
At least that's what I reckon is happening.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
And that's the same thing as checking.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,440
Our culture is being crushed underfoot

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,760
by radicals who want to destroy polite society

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
to achieve their own ends.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, those hecking, gosh darned, flipping bastards.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,320
Christianity comes under attack.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
There's a war on Christmas.

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,880
They outlawed Merry Christmas a few years ago,

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
and you know it.

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,640
Christmas becomes ever more about shallow displays

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,280
of political correctness.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Happy holidays, not Merry Christmas.

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,400
Kids no longer have Christmas vacation, holiday vacation.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,520
Christmas parties, holiday parties.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,720
The war on Christmas.

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
Whoever's watching this right now,

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
think of something you love

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,800
that brings you a sense of peace and decency,

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,720
and they will somehow link it to the patriarchy

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,400
and the rest of their politically correct nonsense.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,280
Christianity is being bigoted against.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,320
We're under attack.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,280
You couldn't even say Merry Christmas at Walmart.

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Obama said Merry Christmas a few times,

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,320
but he still made sure to neuter the Christmas cards

64
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,760
and also the Christmas decorations at the White House.

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,760
What we're seeing happening has been a recent phenomenon,

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,760
the war on Christmas, the war against religious liberty.

67
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,680
Of course it's a war on Christmas.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,040
Christmas has lost all meaning thanks to cultural Marxism.

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Ah, it's those bloody cultural Marxists

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,760
ruining everything again.

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
That's why society's getting worse.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,920
It can't possibly be because of the policies

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,760
of the people who keep getting elected.

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,000
But don't worry, peace-loving citizens.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm here to lead the charge in fighting back

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,960
against these imaginary ghosts,

77
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,160
so grab a slice of anonymous holiday meat

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,480
and settle into your festive-season Anderson shelter

79
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,040
before the political correctness bombs hit

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,480
because it's time for the war on Christmas.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,920
Ooh, I won.

82
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,280
Ho, ho, ho!

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
Merry Chri-

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,960
Whoa!

85
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,440
In most Western countries,

86
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,840
the winter season plays host to many religious

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,120
and cultural traditions.

88
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,520
Some people say the phrase,

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,440
happy holidays, exists as a way of trying

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,560
to be more inclusive to other people's traditions

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,840
in the modern era, but this is inaccurate.

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,120
I did literally five minutes of Googling

93
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,800
and found happy holidays being used as far back as 1863,

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
and who knows how far back further

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
it would have turned out to have gone

96
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
if I'd done any more research.

97
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,000
It turns out that people like to have

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,200
more than one phrase to say.

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,920
It's why people put season's greetings on stuff.

100
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
This isn't blasphemy. It's language.

101
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,000
Did you know we've been writing X-mas

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
instead of Christmas for thousands of years?

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,360
The X isn't trying to secularize the religion

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
by removing the word Christ or something.

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440
It's actually the Greek letter chi,

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
which has been a Christogram,

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,320
an abbreviation of Jesus Christ,

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,880
for about 1,700 years or something.

109
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,120
I don't know. I'm not a religion...studier.

110
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
An extremely popular song from 19-

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Theologian. That was the word.

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
A very popular song from as far back as 1942

113
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,560
was Happy Holiday.

114
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
You might know this song or at least one

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
of its 65 million covers.

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
It was originally sung by Bing Crosby

117
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
who was, by all accounts, a pretty devoted Catholic.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Bing was one of the faces of Christmas for decades.

119
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
His Christmas radio broadcasts were hugely popular.

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,800
That song was the opening and closing theme

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
of his Christmas Sing with Bing program

122
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,640
which aired every Christmas Eve for almost 10 years.

123
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,400
So sure, happy holidays is a useful catch-all term

124
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
since there are a lot of holidays going on.

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
Makes sense to use it in some contexts,

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,080
but saying it isn't actually a new phenomenon.

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
It's been a normal thing for Christians

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,360
to say to each other for many years,

129
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,560
and that piece of knowledge is one of the finest gifts

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,800
I can bring.

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,080
Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.

132
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,160
Peace on Earth!

133
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,360
These are all indisputable and quite interesting

134
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,760
historical facts,

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,040
but not everyone puts the truth on their Christmas list.

136
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,840
Some people want to open their stockings

137
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,800
and find an explanation for why they're angry all the time.

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,240
The big originator of the War on Christmas theory

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,400
is Bill O'Reilly.

140
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,240
I couldn't find footage of Bill's original

141
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,480
War on Christmas segment,

142
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,440
but handily, the script Bill reads from

143
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,360
in these segments was posted as an article

144
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
on Fox's website.

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,240
The segment was titled Christmas Under Siege

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,920
in which he made exaggerated claims

147
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
about how various holiday parades

148
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
were doing away with Christmas floats,

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,280
New York has a holiday tree instead of a Christmas tree,

150
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,520
and how Macy's stopped greeting people

151
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,840
with Merry Christmas.

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
They said a different thing!

153
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,320
O'Reilly then went on to fantasize

154
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,480
that this was part of a plot

155
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,680
to diminish people's faith in religion,

156
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,960
saying that, quote-unquote,

157
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,600
secular progressives wanted to destroy

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,760
religious oppositions to their policies

159
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,520
such as gay marriage, abortion, and drug legalization,

160
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,960
and to bring about this horrible nightmare future,

161
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
it was important to destroy religion in the public arena.

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
Thus, Christian displays like Christmas must be scaled back

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,680
because the connection with Judeo-Christian beliefs

164
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,600
is bad for the secular agenda.

165
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,040
Ah, yes, the famously Judeo-Christian belief

166
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
in Christmas.

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,960
The secular movement has influence in the media,

168
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,120
among some judges and politicians.

169
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,920
Americans will lose their country

170
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,640
if they don't begin to take action.

171
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,400
Any assault on Judeo-Christian philosophy

172
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
should be fought.

173
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,760
Organizations like thomasmoore.org

174
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
and the Alliance Defense Fund in Phoenix

175
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,240
are fighting back but need your help.

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,920
The USA cannot defeat terrorism

177
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,720
and any other evil without a strong,

178
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,200
traditional foundation that clearly defines

179
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
right from wrong.

180
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,320
The struggle today is not about Christmas

181
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,920
but about the spirit of our country.

182
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,960
Ahem.

183
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Bill is writing about how Macy's say a different thing now.

184
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,880
It's basically the conservative version of slam poetry.

185
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,240
Take something that technically has happened

186
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,120
and then contort it until it's an attack

187
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
on the very soul of our society

188
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,960
and we need to defend ourselves,

189
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,800
and that's why we need your attention

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,760
and the money we'll get from our sponsors

191
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,160
for getting eyes on their peppermint-flavored Play-Doh

192
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,600
or ribbed-for-her-pleasure coffee machines.

193
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Bill's early rhetoric forms the basis

194
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
for all the madness to come.

195
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,000
It's always stores not saying Christmas as much,

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,920
stuff like that.

197
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
Holiday wish list?

198
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,240
Oh, no.

199
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,840
God is dead and we have killed him.

200
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,680
The other side outnumbers them.

201
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,240
I mean, Christian, Judeo, Christian,

202
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
people who believe in that philosophy

203
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,400
outnumber the secularists,

204
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,440
maybe six to seven to one.

205
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,320
Oh, my religion has more subscribers than yours.

206
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,200
By the end of his tenure, Bill was straight up

207
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,040
just saying the names of companies

208
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,280
which were trying to slit the throat of Christmas.

209
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,160
Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Foot Locker,

210
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,000
The Gap, The Limited, Nordstrom,

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
shopping on Amazon.

212
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
This year's list was handily provided to Bill

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,280
by the American Family Association.

214
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
The AFA website is a series of articles

215
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,480
about how only the left does violence

216
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,840
because they've never heard of mass shooting statistics,

217
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,360
LGBT people are the real bullies because, uh,

218
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
a woman refused to accept her children were trans

219
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,680
and they stopped wanting to talk to her,

220
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Hallmark and Chick-fil-A are the devil now

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
because they showed a lesbian wedding

222
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,520
in a commercial or something,

223
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,160
and how VeggieTales is back.

224
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh, and also tons of war on Christmas bullshit

225
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,600
verbatim stealing Bill's old schtick.

226
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,800
Three guys you've never heard of discuss the secular push

227
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,880
to scrub away the root word of Christ in Christmas.

228
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,640
There was a war on Christmas we were noticing.

229
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Some people may say,

230
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
well, that's not really a big deal, is it?

231
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,520
Well, we thought it was part of the secularist push

232
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,040
to scrub all references to Christianity from our culture.

233
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard all this before.

234
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,160
The secularists want to destroy Christianity

235
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,280
and they're doing it by rewording a few things at Christmas

236
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,960
but the AFA, unlike Fox, don't have advertisers.

237
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
They survive through donations

238
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,360
and selling things on their website

239
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,240
and you bet they've got a way of capitalizing

240
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,640
on the war on Christmas.

241
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,400
They want you to buy a button that reminds people

242
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,280
that Jesus Christ exists.

243
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,640
Well, it is the Christmas season

244
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,720
and we've got these buttons that we are offering.

245
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,080
Honestly, how can people know

246
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,280
you're a real member of the Jesus fan club

247
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,440
if you aren't repping his holy merch?

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,680
You can get your 10-pack of these buttons for $15

249
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
and just go to afa.net.

250
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
Is it AFA store?

251
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
AFA?

252
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,560
Either one.

253
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,800
Afastore.net, afastore.net.

254
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,840
Which brings us to the AFA's yearly naughty or nice list.

255
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,720
One of the most deludedly self-righteous lists

256
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,480
I've ever read and I've read my top 10 games

257
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,560
of the decade list.

258
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,000
Both versions of Dark Souls II are on there out of spite.

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
Fuck you.

260
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,120
We are not friends.

261
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Click on any naughty company name

262
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
for details and contact information.

263
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
They want you to send emails to some guy

264
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
who works at Office Depot to try to get them

265
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,960
to write Christmas on things more.

266
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,680
If a company has items associated with Christmas

267
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
but did not use the word Christmas,

268
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,680
then the company is considered as censoring Christmas.

269
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,800
That's the rubric.

270
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,720
If you sell me a cracker at Christmas

271
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
but you don't call it a Christmas cracker,

272
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,360
you're a secularist terrorist

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
who's trying to stab the Christmas family.

274
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,040
For many years, Bill, with the help of the AFA,

275
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,760
was the reigning champion of the fight to save Christmas.

276
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,920
He was the only man standing up to defend Christian values,

277
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,520
which are the reason he knows right from wrong so well.

278
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,720
But then in 2017, he got fired

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,440
for allegedly sexually harassing

280
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,840
at least six of his female co-workers.

281
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,160
So Bill wasn't exactly a great follower

282
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,720
of his religious teachings, was he?

283
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,760
It's very clear why the war on Christmas argument

284
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,960
is so attention-grabbing.

285
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,560
It's telling people that their religion is under attack

286
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
and we need those traditional values

287
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,440
or our country will fall to terrorism or other evil.

288
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,040
People will pay attention to your show

289
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,280
when you say things like that,

290
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,840
which leads to increased viewership

291
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,320
and higher value of your advertising spots.

292
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,600
You might even get people to buy a button

293
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,360
or get some wealthy cretins

294
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,600
to donate comical amounts of money to you.

295
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,440
However, I don't think this alone

296
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,040
gets to the true core of why this belief survives

297
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,800
so well in the minds of more extreme conservatives,

298
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,680
so we're gonna have to go deeper,

299
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
and then it says in brackets,

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
Inception Horn Noise.

301
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that.

302
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,040
Maybe to understand this line of thinking further,

303
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,920
we need to go in search of even more ridiculously false

304
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,720
and silly versions and see how it functions there.

305
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,440
First, I want to start off with a central theme

306
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,480
which is the war on Christmas.

307
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Oh, hi, Paul.

308
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
In this classic video from 2017,

309
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
which is a yearly rewatch for me,

310
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,720
it's just a hilarious shambles in so many ways,

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
Paul Joseph Watson spends 15 minutes

312
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
of what's left of his life,

313
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,600
and you only get one life.

314
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,080
This is it, complaining that there's a Tesco commercial

315
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,040
with too much diversity in it.

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
They called it a Christmas ad,

317
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,080
or at least it was supposed to be that.

318
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,640
Didn't have any symbols of Christianity

319
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,200
in the ad whatsoever.

320
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,840
It did have a gay couple, hijabi Muslims,

321
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,400
all this other goth.

322
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,840
No actual Christian symbol

323
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,120
because, of course, we can't have that anymore, can we?

324
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,480
At least, like, put a vicar in it or something.

325
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,840
A cross. Anything Christian.

326
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,600
It's a Christmas ad for God's sake.

327
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,040
All right, fine, Paul. I'll see what I can do.

328
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,360
Ah, approved for broadcast in InfoWars land.

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,920
Wait, Paul also stipulated that a religious figure

330
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,600
would suffice. Okay, how about this?

331
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,440
Hey, guys, that was the College of Cardinals on the phone.

332
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,280
I've just been elected pope.

333
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,080
There, is that religious enough for you?

334
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,120
And if that's not good enough,

335
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,640
I bet I can undo some more catechisms.

336
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,200
Ah, but hang on a second.

337
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,840
It's easy to make fun of Paul.

338
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
He's made sure of that,

339
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
but let's seriously look at the idea

340
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,200
there is some kind of manipulation happening

341
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
with the lack of Christian iconography

342
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,600
in this commercial because this begs a deeper question

343
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,960
which is should Christmas commercials

344
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,000
prominently display Christian stuff

345
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
like crosses and priests

346
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,880
because I haven't seen a convincing argument

347
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
that the answer to that question is yes

348
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,680
because even in commercials long before

349
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,640
the supposed war on Christmas,

350
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,160
you can still see a seemingly deliberate choice

351
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,840
not to explicitly invoke Christianity

352
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,480
even when the intended audience would be mostly Christian

353
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,680
because it turns out Christians have been having

354
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,960
this exact discussion for a long time now

355
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,000
even before anyone knew what political correctness was.

356
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,640
Historically, plenty of Christians have found

357
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,120
that their religion being tied to a product

358
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,400
being sold to them is kind of crass and disgusting.

359
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,600
There's a Fox & Friends segment from a few years ago

360
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,120
that highlights this discrepancy in an amazing way.

361
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,280
They had a real Catholic priest on

362
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
to discuss the war on Christmas

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,400
but despite how hard they tried to push him,

364
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,280
he wasn't annoyed that things weren't Christian enough.

365
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,040
You'd be fine if it said Merry Christmas

366
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,680
but it doesn't. It says Happy Holidays

367
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,280
or things are simply red or green.

368
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
Well, it's not so much that that bothers me.

369
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
It's more that the consumerism

370
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,840
and the pressure to just shop, shop, shop.

371
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,120
He was much more concerned with how consumerism

372
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
had eroded the religious meaning of the holiday.

373
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
It's more the consumerism I think that's a problem for me.

374
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,120
All right, so let's take a look at some of the stores

375
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,000
that have taken Christmas out of their mottos.

376
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
J.Crew.

377
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,040
You can see the Fox people had really planned

378
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
for a very different kind of interview.

379
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,960
They'd prepared a graphic all about the mottos

380
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,520
that didn't say Christmas anymore

381
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,560
but not everyone is interested in fabricating

382
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
a culture war for attention.

383
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Some people actually want to think about things.

384
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,600
I guess it bothers me that they're using, uh,

385
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,760
sort of, uh, overtly Christian, uh, tropes and themes

386
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,920
like Believe and Merry and things like that

387
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,480
that are associated with Christmas

388
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
but they're using it to just market goods.

389
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Now, I don't think it's intentional.

390
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,200
I think it's just a way to appeal

391
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,320
to as many people as possible

392
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,360
but it really kind of denudes, uh,

393
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,560
the holiday of, uh, any sort of religious import.

394
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,720
And it seems that for many devout Christians

395
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,560
the concern isn't that commercials

396
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,920
aren't Christian enough.

397
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,320
It's the exact opposite,

398
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,400
that commercials are leaning a bit too heavily

399
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,720
on Christian ideas and themes in order to sell products.

400
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,800
But the Catholic Church is notoriously full

401
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,080
of commie scumbags.

402
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,760
It just hasn't been the same since the Byzantine Papacy.

403
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,960
You don't have to get it. Don't worry.

404
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,800
Sometimes you write jokes just for you.

405
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,080
Now, I'm not a fancy big time Christian boy

406
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,240
but maybe commercializing the religious aspect

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,040
of Christmas in order to sell people things is bad

408
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,480
and the more generic holiday themes in stores

409
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,880
and commercials is a good way of respecting

410
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,680
Christians' religious traditions

411
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,760
and it's been that way since long before 2017.

412
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,360
Paul's whole narrative here is based on the assumption

413
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,880
that commercials loved to invoke Christianity

414
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,080
until Twitter invented social justice

415
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,160
but as we've seen, this assumption is objectively false

416
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,200
and inventing an imaginary past that's been stolen

417
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,120
to justify present foolishness is a real Rachel move.

418
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,520
Regina Phalange.

419
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,240
Facts and data are inconvenient for Paul

420
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
so he doesn't like to bring them up

421
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,880
but I saw something interesting that I thought was relevant

422
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,800
so I'm gonna talk about it while I have the chance.

423
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,560
There's a great paper by the National Center

424
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,640
for Social Research which has been gathering data

425
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,200
about how people approach their religion

426
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,640
for about 35 years now

427
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,520
and what they discovered is quite interesting.

428
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,280
In the last 30 years, less and less people identify

429
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,760
as Christian, at least according to the most accurate data.

430
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,480
This corresponds with an increase in people

431
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,360
identifying specifically as unreligious or atheist.

432
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,720
Since the 2010s, there's been decisively more

433
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,040
non-religious people in Britain than Christians even.

434
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Most of these people probably still celebrate

435
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,960
Christian traditions.

436
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,640
They're a common part of English culture.

437
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm an atheist and I still celebrate Christmas

438
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
but all these folks probably aren't putting crosses

439
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,280
anywhere in their houses and really,

440
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,560
who's to say that that's what Christians do?

441
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,920
Not everyone thinks that celebrating their faith

442
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,800
requires putting a cross in their house.

443
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,520
People's relationships with their religion

444
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
aren't that simple.

445
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,360
There's no Christmas handbook

446
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,080
mandating you hang a cross up for the Yuletide.

447
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,040
In fact, the actual Christian handbook

448
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,480
seems to prioritize worshiping in private

449
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,840
unlike those darn pagans who love to babble on and on.

450
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,520
What a weird thing to specify.

451
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,960
I guess what I'm trying to say is for most people,

452
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
this commercial is an accurate representation

453
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
of how people behave at Christmas.

454
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
It's just not about throwing crosses around, you know?

455
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
But while we're on the topic of representation,

456
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,680
I can't help but notice the specific lack

457
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
of lightsabers or delicious space milk

458
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,440
anywhere in this commercial

459
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,480
even though according to census data,

460
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,560
almost 1% of Britons self-identify as Jedi.

461
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
Probably not after this Christmas though.

462
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,040
No! Stop it! No!

463
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,000
Paul's rant kind of goes on for a while.

464
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,080
He doesn't really have a point he's getting to

465
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,760
so much as he's mad a commercial has Muslims in it

466
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
for a few seconds.

467
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,360
He's mad it's a Twitter moment

468
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
and some people are applauding the diversity.

469
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,520
He's sure that a YouTube video being brigaded

470
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,920
by his followers and getting a couple of thousand dislikes

471
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,000
indicates actually it's very unpopular and so on.

472
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,080
You can even see in his face that he's struggling

473
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,200
to really articulate a decent justification to be angry.

474
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,040
Of course, there was a backlash to the backlash

475
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,880
which basically peaked yesterday with Twitter.

476
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,160
Twitter came out and said this was one of their

477
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
featured stories in their Twitter moments

478
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,680
which of course is on the homepage

479
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,400
when anybody goes onto Twitter.

480
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Ha ha ha! Imagine this being your life.

481
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,000
It's stuff like this that really gives context

482
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,440
to tweets where he's mad at black celebrities

483
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,960
talking about racism,

484
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,840
calling them sanctimonious crybabies.

485
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,600
Saying Britain still has racism is annoying.

486
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,400
What's way more important and pressing

487
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,280
is the Tesco Christmas commercial.

488
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,760
He's also very sure this stuff

489
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,960
isn't Bill O'Reilly nonsense anymore.

490
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,480
It used to be, but it's real now.

491
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,280
It's no longer some Bill O'Reilly meme

492
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,600
when it's actually happening.

493
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,160
He keeps saying this over and over.

494
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,960
It's like boomer dubstep.

495
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Now, I remember 10, 15 years ago,

496
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
this is something that Bill O'Reilly,

497
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
these other neocons would constantly bring up.

498
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
People would debunk it and say it's a false concern.

499
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
It's being exaggerated.

500
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
There's no war on Christmas.

501
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,920
What are you talking about? This is crazy.

502
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,520
Well, fast forward to 2017.

503
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
Everything Bill O'Reilly said, yeah, that was crazy,

504
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,480
but fast forward to the Tesco Christmas commercial.

505
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,040
The thing about Info Wars videos

506
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,280
which are recorded live on the actual show,

507
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
the ones where Alex is also there

508
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
and Paul's just calling in,

509
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
is that Paul is fundamentally not a very good live speaker.

510
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm not saying this because I disagree

511
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,480
with his political views or to make fun of him.

512
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,720
He's a poor public speaker.

513
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,760
It's just not one of his skills, and that's fine.

514
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
Some people are just too self-conscious for it.

515
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,480
That's why he writes his videos in advance

516
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,400
and edits them with snappy cuts and always is yelling.

517
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
It makes his work hold people's attention,

518
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,800
but he just can't maintain that energy in a live setting.

519
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,480
Worse, his clear anxieties about what he's doing

520
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,120
start to come through when the spotlight's on him too long.

521
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,200
Sometimes he workshops his tweets in the pub

522
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,080
with his friends before he posts them.

523
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
No, I'm serious.

524
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,800
He shows the tweet on his phone to his friends and asks,

525
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
is this okay? Should I post it?

526
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,760
Looking for some kind of approval

527
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,400
with an anxious look on his face.

528
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,640
And it's a tweet petulantly quoting Stormzy out of context

529
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,240
in order to imply that he hates all white people,

530
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,680
and his remaining real-life friends nod and go,

531
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,040
yeah, sure, man.

532
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,480
I don't get why it's a big deal to you,

533
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,320
but I guess it's for your job, right?

534
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
And then one of them sends me a message about it later.

535
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,400
But anyway, my point is Paul isn't that great

536
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
at this whole live entertainment thing,

537
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,160
and there's a reason Alex Jones uses him

538
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,280
as sporadically as he can on his shows.

539
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,560
He's only got about five things to say,

540
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
and he has to keep saying them over and over.

541
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,080
So eventually Alex realizes he needs to jump in

542
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,280
and starts interrupting him with points of his own.

543
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,240
It's a Christmas ad for God's sake,

544
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
but here's the kicker.

545
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,480
It's like having a Christmas ad

546
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,840
where you drag Santa Claus behind a car.

547
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,520
Yeah, there'd be newspaper articles about it all week.

548
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, Paul, this is cultural appropriation.

549
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,520
This is what the left's all about, is overriding,

550
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,160
taking control of everything, dominating culture.

551
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,560
All the headlines are like,

552
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,520
oh, you're so offended at seeing Muslims.

553
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,720
It's like, no, I'm offended at the fact,

554
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,920
or I'm perplexed at the fact there's no...

555
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,680
It'd be like if you had an ad saying,

556
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,840
this holiday season, support Ramadan

557
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,640
at your local halal stores,

558
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,360
and then it showed guys in Knights Templar uniforms

559
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,840
at the Muslim store.

560
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,200
The Muslim store.

561
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
The other big claim he's making in this war on Christmas bit

562
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,920
also has to do with Tesco.

563
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,640
Paul went to a Tesco's and noticed, to his horror,

564
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,440
that not enough things said Christmas,

565
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,360
so he whipped out his phone and took some pictures

566
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,280
to complain about on Twitter later.

567
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,600
There's a funny bit in this video

568
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
where Alex says he should have documented it,

569
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,560
not realizing Paul already had.

570
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,880
They've got these Christmas cards, Alex.

571
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
They call them, they've renamed them.

572
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,200
They're now called charity cards.

573
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,960
Paul, you gotta go back in and get some footage of this.

574
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,480
Well, I've got the pictures and I tweeted them,

575
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,640
but people said...

576
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,560
Just incredibly poor communication

577
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,680
going on at InfoWars.

578
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,640
The tweets themselves are really something.

579
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Was in Tesco earlier.

580
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,440
Their entire...

581
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,280
I can't do his voice.

582
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,600
Their entire Christmas shelf,

583
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,680
cards, wrapping paper, confectionery,

584
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,560
not a single mention of the word Christmas.

585
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
Not a single one.

586
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Christmas cards are now called charity cards.

587
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,760
Pathetic.

588
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,120
Truly pathetic.

589
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Then he atted Tesco.

590
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,640
Yeah, this is Tesco speaking.

591
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,680
I'm sorry, Paul.

592
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,880
We'll put Christmas on the crack.

593
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,480
And before all you pointy heads claim

594
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,000
they're called charity cards

595
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,120
because some proceeds go to charity,

596
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,480
that's always been the case,

597
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,760
but they were still called Christmas cards.

598
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,520
It's not just the commercial.

599
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,000
At Tesco has capitulated to politically correct douchebaggery.

600
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,760
And then there's a picture of some crackers

601
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,600
and they're just called crackers.

602
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,840
You know, because that's their name.

603
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,400
They're not even calling them Christmas crackers anymore.

604
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,120
The war on Christmas used to be some far right,

605
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
evangelical, Bill O'Reilly.

606
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,520
Jesus Christ, Paul, we get it.

607
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
You don't have to say it that many times.

608
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,880
Truly saddening.

609
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
After all these years,

610
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,200
Tesco have finally started the war on Christmas for real.

611
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
There's no Christmas anywhere in Tesco anymore.

612
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,440
Not a single one.

613
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,120
However, eagle-eyed viewers,

614
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,080
well, frankly, eyed viewers

615
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,640
who take a look at the photograph

616
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,920
for more than a nanosecond

617
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,960
might start to notice things Paul somehow didn't notice

618
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,160
when he was literally standing there looking at them.

619
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,760
For example, if you zoom in on one of his own pictures,

620
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,360
you can actually see Merry Christmas

621
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
written on some of the crackers.

622
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,640
Some people went into their local Tesco

623
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
and found that Christmas was written everywhere.

624
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,880
Some people pointed out that these charity cards

625
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,440
were in a display marked Christmas cards

626
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,040
and still others looked at packs of these charity cards

627
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,360
and found that some of them say Merry Christmas on them.

628
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,960
Tesco also has Christmas all over its website

629
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,120
where it happens to refer to the charity cards

630
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,160
as charity Christmas cards.

631
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,240
The website also refers to crackers as Christmas crackers.

632
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,880
Not a single one.

633
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,840
These things were mentioned to Paul immediately

634
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,320
in response to the tweets when he made them a few years ago

635
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,440
and good fun was had by all laughing

636
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,320
at this sad middle-aged man

637
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,440
taking pictures in Tesco to whine about.

638
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,240
By far the funniest bit of this video

639
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,280
is when they cut to a feed of Paul's tweet thread

640
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,440
about the Tesco stuff and when they're scrolling down,

641
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,080
they accidentally scroll to the tweet

642
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,520
pointing out Christmas is literally on the packaging

643
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,160
and then whoever's doing the screen capture panics,

644
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,240
zooms out, and scrolls down one more

645
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,920
and it's the one pointing out Christmas is on the website

646
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,480
and they just have to awkwardly fade back to Paul

647
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,800
saying it's not all made up.

648
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
This is definitely real.

649
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,040
Now, I mean, this is not some kind of Bill O'Reilly meme

650
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,240
from the early 2000s anymore.

651
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,560
This is actually happening.

652
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,760
No, I get it, Paul. It's not just Bill O'Reilly anymore.

653
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,400
You made that point already. Move on.

654
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,840
This is a deliberate Orwellian process

655
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
of eliminating words, changing language

656
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,080
for the purposes of some lame nod at political correctness.

657
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,720
Okay, some of you might be confused at this point

658
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,960
so let's just get this straight.

659
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,320
The far left who, as we all know, run Tesco

660
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,360
are trying to undermine culture

661
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,560
because they're worried about sounding racist

662
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,840
so they're doing this by not letting stores

663
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,760
put Christmas anywhere except in the stores,

664
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
the products in the stores, and on the website.

665
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
There, sorted. See?

666
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
It's the Marxists at it again.

667
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,680
I went into Tesco on Saturday,

668
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,760
went to the Christmas section of the store.

669
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,600
Not one mention of Christmas.

670
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,520
They don't even mention the word Christmas.

671
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,160
Paul, of course they did.

672
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
That's how you know it's the Christmas section!

673
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,720
That's why every year I know exactly where the elves are.

674
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,480
You can't hide from me.

675
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,840
Now, there is one minor thing worth talking about here.

676
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,680
One teensy, tiny thing that Paul might not have thought about

677
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,040
which is that one of the reasons why Christmas

678
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,240
isn't written on everything is because you already know

679
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
it's for Christmas.

680
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,640
All the Christmas stuff is only in stores

681
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,960
in the Christmas season for you to buy for Christmas.

682
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
They're neatly arranged in special red aisles

683
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,560
so you know where to look for the Christmas stuff.

684
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,640
Putting Christmas on every single thing is just pointless.

685
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,280
This isn't even to do with political correctness.

686
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,040
It's just basic store design.

687
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,920
They don't feel the need to acknowledge Christmas

688
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,720
on the label because Christmas is being acknowledged

689
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,240
at every other point in this transaction.

690
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Oh, no, the label of this wrapping paper

691
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,160
doesn't say Christmas wrapping paper.

692
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,120
Help, I'm being tricked into forgetting my religion exists.

693
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,760
Oh, Christmas is written all over the fucking wrapping paper?

694
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,920
Oh, well, I guess I'll celebrate Christmas again this year.

695
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,520
God, the cultural Marxists had better get their act together

696
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,920
if they're gonna win this war.

697
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,960
Ugh, ah, fuck, ugh.

698
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,440
Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

699
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,600
There, that's probably structurally stable, right?

700
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,920
Now, one might say, ah, it's not fair

701
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,400
to go after an old InfoWars video.

702
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,080
What if InfoWars have spontaneously become smart

703
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,720
and rational now and cleverly moved on

704
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,120
from a topic that they got obliterated on

705
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,720
when people looked at their own photos?

706
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,200
Well, yeah, they did.

707
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,520
They dropped the topic and decided to move on

708
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,240
to doing real journalism.

709
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm kidding, they did another one this year.

710
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,800
Alex Jones goes to the Texas state capital

711
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,360
to witness the city of Austin's Christmas tree

712
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
and expose the anti-Christian agenda

713
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,760
hidden in plain sight.

714
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,560
The banner beneath the tree that reads,

715
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,720
Happy Holidays.

716
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,200
Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen.

717
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,840
Merry Christmas.

718
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,560
And it's about Jesus Christ.

719
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,600
It's not about the big corporations

720
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,200
and the chi-com atheists and the globalists.

721
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,160
I think the existence of videos like this

722
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,400
really crystallizes what the war on Christmas

723
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,760
is actually about.

724
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,480
Bullshit artists like InfoWars

725
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,960
have to play a very careful game

726
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,240
to survive and make money.

727
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,440
InfoWars can't make money as a news website

728
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,400
because they don't actually do any journalism

729
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,840
so no one comes to them for that

730
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,440
and they can't easily sell advertisements

731
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,640
on their website or videos

732
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,240
because for unknown reasons,

733
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,600
barely anyone wants to be associated with them.

734
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,480
It starts out with, don't use the N-word.

735
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Well, I don't use that, so okay.

736
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,040
And the next it's, oh, don't say Merry Christmas.

737
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Say Happy Holidays.

738
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Yeah, those are the same thing.

739
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,760
Eh, I never thought of it that way.

740
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,480
Imagine a shoe company looking for somewhere to advertise

741
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,680
and seeing one of these videos

742
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,760
and it's Alex Jones going,

743
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,880
remember when they tricked us

744
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,720
into not saying the N-word anymore?

745
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,600
Well, Happy Holidays is just like that.

746
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,720
They're probably gonna say no

747
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,120
but Alex Jones has this problem

748
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,040
which is that he really, really likes expensive watches.

749
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,760
He loves to wear Rolexes on his show

750
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,040
and according to court records,

751
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,440
he once bought four of them in a single day.

752
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
The cheapest one I could find him wearing

753
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,400
cost around $12,000.

754
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,440
So obviously he needs a lot of money to live

755
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,040
and how's he gonna do that?

756
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,720
Why, he'd have to develop some kind of business model

757
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,160
that revolves around exploiting gullible people.

758
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,560
So their best bet is to target a very specific demographic.

759
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,600
In this case, conservatives with a conspiratorial streak

760
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,640
validate them by telling them that they're right

761
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,680
and then going, hey,

762
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,640
if you want to become even more powerful,

763
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,000
check out our pills.

764
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,280
Also get all you need to completely stuff

765
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,520
Christmas stockings this year

766
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
with our Christmas Mega Pack.

767
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,240
So it starts with, don't say Merry Christmas,

768
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
and it ends with,

769
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,280
they create an orthodox centralized system as well

770
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,120
that is gonna be welded in to the new fascist left west

771
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,200
and out of that marriage,

772
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,720
you will have the communist socialist system

773
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,520
of Islam merged with that.

774
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,480
I mean, this sentence doesn't make sense.

775
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,320
It just doesn't.

776
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,960
It's a list of keywords

777
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,800
but just making fun of how dumb this all is

778
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,120
would be to ignore why he still does it and why it works.

779
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
On topics like this, I find myself constantly coming back

780
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,560
to a great paper by Cormac Hurley,

781
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,200
a principal researcher at Microsoft,

782
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,800
about Nigerian email scams and how they function.

783
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,080
You know how the Nigerian email scams

784
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,680
usually have very poor language usage and grammar

785
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,640
and even say they're from Nigeria

786
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,560
even though if you Google Nigeria,

787
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,800
one of the first results is email scam

788
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,400
and that makes them an obvious scam to most people?

789
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,760
This is actually part of how the scam works

790
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
because their targets are the sort of people

791
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,640
who won't notice the writing problems

792
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
because they tend to be the sort of people

793
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,960
who end up giving them money.

794
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,160
If you're smart enough to not fall for that part,

795
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,040
they don't want you wasting their time

796
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,000
and they've quite smartly selected you out of the process

797
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,080
by writing poorly.

798
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,520
Since gullibility is unobservable,

799
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,320
the best strategy is to get those

800
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,800
who possess this quality to self-identify.

801
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Infowars is following a similar business practice.

802
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,200
Alex Jones's objective is to make money

803
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
to sustain his expensive lifestyle

804
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,400
where he eats watches or something

805
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
and to do that, he needs to target an audience

806
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,240
who will be fooled into buying his overpriced stuff.

807
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,680
So by talking absolute nonsense,

808
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,360
yes, Jones is turning away everyone with half a brain,

809
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,800
but people with half a brain generally are quite hard

810
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,000
to sell the world's most expensive protein bars,

811
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,840
ultimate fish oil, and, uh, Ultra 12.

812
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,160
Jones is deliberately laser targeting

813
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,400
the kind of people who would hear a phrase like

814
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,120
the communist socialist system of Islam

815
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,760
and think, wow, that's bad.

816
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,040
That's really bad. That's three bad things I hate.

817
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,960
How do I stop that thing that must be happening

818
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,000
because the man with the nice watch said it was?

819
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,280
Which leaves them open to being sold the idea

820
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,080
that keeping Infowars afloat by buying their stuff

821
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,400
is basically the same as showing you're a hero

822
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,360
fighting back against these very real problems

823
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,720
and for the people who fall for it,

824
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,760
it is a real ego boost which creates a loyal fan base

825
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,160
full of repeat customers.

826
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,400
Nobody finds these videos convincing,

827
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,640
but the people therefore find them reassuring.

828
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,720
What you call weird conspiracy theorists

829
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,800
who need validation,

830
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,480
some people call a marketable demographic,

831
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,240
but to keep this machine going,

832
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,400
Jones has to find increasingly outlandish things to say

833
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,960
to hold these people's attention

834
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,000
and come up with reasons to keep supporting him

835
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,400
and fighting the Infowar,

836
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
and that means getting more and more ridiculous

837
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,200
as the infinite eternal threat

838
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,600
only gets even more infinitely threatening.

839
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,240
Not only does this dance get increasingly difficult,

840
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,800
they've also discovered that you can't just say lies

841
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,240
about people, it turns out.

842
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,800
If they say ridiculous bullshit about real people,

843
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,480
they risk being sued for libel or defamation

844
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,680
as is the case with the Sandy Hook parents

845
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,080
who are in the process of fucking destroying

846
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,800
Jones in court for telling his sizable audience

847
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,160
that the parents of murdered children

848
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,920
are all just paid actors and it was a fake shooting,

849
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,440
so the war on Christmas is a real boon for Jones

850
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,000
because he can just go hog wild

851
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,360
about whatever comes into his head,

852
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,560
just make up whatever,

853
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,880
and occasionally cut to footage

854
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,240
of a tree being pushed over

855
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
or some random act of vandalism

856
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,720
and explain how they're all connected

857
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,320
by a web of destruction

858
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,920
by the secret Muslim communist anti-family coalition

859
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,360
and it's so incomprehensible

860
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,680
it can't even be considered defamation of anyone.

861
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,600
This is the kind of nonsense safe zone

862
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,240
Infowars has to live in to avoid destroying itself

863
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,680
by getting owned in court which is why,

864
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,320
for legal reasons,

865
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,440
I'm required to mention that story I told earlier

866
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,600
about Paul Joseph Watson is not true.

867
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,800
I made it up. Those DMs are fake.

868
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,480
I thought it would be a funny joke to show how shitty it is

869
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,880
to make things up about people.

870
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,040
However, even though I made it up,

871
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,320
it definitely did happen.

872
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,080
The war on Christmas is a safe bet for Jones to cover

873
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,560
since there's no obvious tangible negative effect

874
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
on real people except his audience

875
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,400
whose minds he is completely ruining

876
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,480
but that's their choice.

877
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
As what some French people might call

878
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,040
a connoisseur of Infowars garbage,

879
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,320
so I guess it's me whose life they're ruining,

880
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,120
this is my favorite kind of the schlock they do

881
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,680
where Alex just grabs a cameraman

882
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,480
and goes out in public and just makes a bunch of noise

883
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
and runs around annoying people

884
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,280
and getting to arguments with whoever he can get

885
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,520
his soy-stained hands on.

886
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,680
Sometimes he forgets that trying to cite data

887
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,280
opens him up to being punked

888
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,840
and accidentally offers statistics

889
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,440
that can be easily rebuked with simple explanations

890
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,560
and then they have to leave it in

891
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,760
because that's the best footage they got that night.

892
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,400
There is a war on Christmas.

893
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,560
There is a war on Christianity.

894
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,440
Did you know that more than half

895
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,760
of all religious persecution in the world

896
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,040
is against Christians?

897
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,000
I believe it. I mean, we're one of the largest groups.

898
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,960
Oh. So statistically,

899
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,520
if there's attack on a region,

900
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
there's gonna be a lot of attack on Christians.

901
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Uh...

902
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
♪ Somebody wants to kill... ♪

903
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,880
Once that kid politely shakes his hand and leaves,

904
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,240
Jones starts losing it,

905
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,800
just screaming Merry Christmas into the void,

906
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,440
talking about how free he is from control.

907
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,720
Merry Christmas!

908
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,520
We're not surrendering, ladies and gentlemen.

909
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,280
America and the world is awake.

910
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,520
Freedom is rising,

911
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
and Merry Christmas from Infowars.com.

912
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,720
But then he remembers that the point of all this

913
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,920
is to push his products,

914
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,160
so then there's another few minutes

915
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,480
where he calms down and talks about the great deals

916
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,960
you can get at InfowarsStore.com.

917
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,160
There's a war on Christmas.

918
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,280
There's a war on America.

919
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,880
There's a war on our free speech.

920
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,880
There's a war on the family's very existence.

921
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,440
And those very same forces that have it out for Christianity

922
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,720
have it out for Infowars

923
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,960
and have it out for you and your family.

924
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,160
But we need you to go to InfowarsStore.com

925
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,880
this Christmas.

926
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,240
We need you to fund Infowars

927
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,440
by getting great products you need.

928
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,200
We've got huge sales going right now.

929
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,320
And this completes the selection process.

930
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,200
After spending 15 minutes literally just running around

931
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,680
and screaming at people,

932
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,320
anyone still watching is probably a prime target

933
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,360
for his advertising.

934
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,400
So you get three whole minutes of him explaining to you

935
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,200
how cheap the deals are.

936
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,400
Everything's still more expensive than the equivalent

937
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,200
you can find at, like, any other store.

938
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,120
But that's not the point.

939
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,680
The point is you're supporting the Info War.

940
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,240
You're saving the world with free speech

941
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,320
and fight bad men.

942
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm so glad I can fight back against control

943
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
by purchasing iodine.

944
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,440
So we find here that the War on Christmas

945
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,720
is a decent way of getting very gullible people

946
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,000
to pay attention long enough

947
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,360
that you can direct sell them diet supplements.

948
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
And we've seen how for people whose business model

949
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,440
involves straying close to legal action,

950
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,120
something ridiculous and silly like the War on Christmas

951
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,400
is kinda a gimme.

952
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,840
You can accuse the bad people coalition

953
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,800
of secret Christmas crimes and you're safe

954
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,880
because imaginary people you made up can't sue you.

955
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,960
However, we still haven't fully discovered

956
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,720
why the War on Christmas specifically has

957
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,360
such a strong appeal to the kinds of sad people

958
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,480
who make up Info War's customer base

959
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
or why conservatives see such an appeal

960
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,680
in believing Christmas is under attack in the first place.

961
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,760
So to find out more, I, uh, got bored

962
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,320
and decided to invent a new recipe for eggnog.

963
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,720
Well, there you have it.

964
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
The War on Christmas is over.

965
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,400
And I guess Christmas won because it turned out

966
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,840
that there never was a war on it.

967
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,680
Oh, well. I think eggs go bad pretty quick, don't they?

968
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,840
♪♪

969
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,600
Oh, my tummy and brain.

970
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,560
I microwaved this earlier to warm it up

971
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,880
and now there's definitely bits of paint loose in it.

972
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Thanks, Neil.

973
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,320
Oh, I think I'm cross-faded on paint fumes and alcohol.

974
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,120
Oh, no, it's happening.

975
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,640
I've lost enough IQ points that I think IQ is real

976
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,160
and that means I'm fucked up enough

977
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,960
to watch a PragerU video.

978
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,480
PragerU is a YouTube channel funded by oil

979
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,880
and fracking barons and other related think tanks

980
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,920
which likes to masquerade as a university.

981
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,320
Honestly, you don't even need to look up the topics they cover.

982
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,160
If you find a list of their major donors,

983
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,000
you can pretty easily guess the entirety

984
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,120
of their video output.

985
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,600
They make five-minute long videos

986
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,960
which feature next to no research or evidence

987
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,280
but they have a lot of money to spend on infographics

988
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,400
and getting special guests to read their scripts

989
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,960
and that's basically the same thing as being true.

990
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,080
This one on the War on Christmas is called

991
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,840
Just Say Merry Christmas.

992
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,640
This is the usual stuff we've seen before

993
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,080
but presented in a new way.

994
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,720
I mean, literally, it's just a repurposed Bill O'Reilly script

995
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,440
complete with an aside about how it's the secularists' fault.

996
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,040
The opponents of Merry Christmas

997
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,960
and other uses of the word Christmas

998
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,680
know exactly what they're doing.

999
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,480
The opponents of Christmas? What the fuck?

1000
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,920
They're disingenuous when they dismiss defenders

1001
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,840
of Merry Christmas as fabricating some,

1002
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,240
quote, war on Christmas.

1003
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,000
Of course it's a war on Christmas

1004
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,800
or more precisely,

1005
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
a war on the religious nature of America.

1006
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,280
When I first watched this video,

1007
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,000
this image kept coming back to me

1008
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,920
of a person who says happy holidays

1009
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,920
and laughs at people who think the war on Christmas is real

1010
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,360
morphing into an enemy combatant.

1011
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,480
Why was this imagery necessary?

1012
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
Why take people laughing at you

1013
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,040
for believing a made-up thing,

1014
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,080
accuse them of knowing exactly what they're doing,

1015
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,760
and then reveal them to be trying

1016
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,360
to destroy America's nature?

1017
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,960
And then I realized that this is the actual core

1018
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
of the whole thing.

1019
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,920
This image actually explains

1020
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,880
more about the conservative ideology

1021
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,600
than anything else we've covered here.

1022
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,400
You see, Dennis Prager and ideologues like him

1023
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,280
have for quite a while been encountering

1024
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
this one small problem,

1025
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,040
which is that their ideas are wrong.

1026
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,800
This is why, if you watch any of PragerU's other videos,

1027
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,680
they're full of completely hysterical,

1028
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,000
imaginary graphs,

1029
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,040
most of which don't even label their axes.

1030
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,880
What even is this?

1031
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,280
And often they make outright false claims

1032
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,720
and tell clear lies.

1033
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,880
Sometimes they fabricate ridiculous quotes

1034
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,760
and put quotations around them as if to say,

1035
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,120
look at this ridiculous thing

1036
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,080
people who disagree with you say,

1037
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,320
but the quote is something they made up.

1038
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,880
No one actually said this.

1039
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,760
They made it up and attributed it to some imaginary enemy

1040
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,080
to try to convince you that this is what people

1041
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,760
who aren't like you believe, so you must be right.

1042
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,400
This constant lying and misrepresentation of reality

1043
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,120
makes my point for me.

1044
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,720
To get you to believe what they believe,

1045
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,600
they have to lie because the truth simply isn't enough

1046
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,960
to support these beliefs.

1047
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,160
The bulk of PragerU consists of strategies

1048
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,920
to get around the fact they don't have a leg to stand on

1049
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,200
when it comes to the truth,

1050
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,400
and this is where the war on Christmas

1051
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,120
and similar conspiracy theories comes in

1052
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,720
because when a belief system is on shaky ground

1053
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,960
when it comes to the truth,

1054
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,240
it needs something else to maintain it,

1055
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,240
extra beliefs and fantasies to prop it all up.

1056
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,320
Otherwise, doubts and anxieties start to come in.

1057
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
What if I'm wrong?

1058
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,800
What if I've missed something?

1059
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,120
What if other people are laughing at me?

1060
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,760
What better way to put a stop to these feelings

1061
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,600
than to convince yourself your enemies

1062
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,840
are trying to destroy your culture,

1063
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,520
even your holidays,

1064
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,880
that they're even doing it on purpose

1065
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,520
and know they're doing it

1066
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,440
because they're the bad guys and you're the good guys?

1067
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,000
Instantly, all your doubts and fears

1068
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,440
that you've missed something,

1069
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,440
all critical thinking can be dismissed.

1070
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,360
Life stops being about reason or evidence

1071
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,200
and starts being about the war

1072
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,080

1127
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,000
you are not being inclusive.

You are excluding me

1129

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,240

1145
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,160
Prager briefly sums up what he calls

1146
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,200
the inclusiveness argument.

1147
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,760
Let's see how he summarizes it.

1148
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,040
That Merry Christmas or Christmas party

1149
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,520
or Christmas vacation is not inclusive.

1150
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,960
Now, what he's saying kind of makes sense here, doesn't it?

1151
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,840
If there's going to be an event during the holiday season

1152
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,400
that's traditionally called a Christmas party

1153
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,480
but some people who don't celebrate Christmas

1154
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,080
might also be invited to it,

1155
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,400
some people might argue that calling it a holiday party

1156
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,160
is a more appropriate name than a Christmas party.

1157
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,600
Now, personally, I don't think it really matters

1158
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,080
what you call a party and I also don't really think

1159
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,840
many non-Christians will decide not to go to an event

1160
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,120
simply because it's called a Christmas event

1161
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,120
but I do see the overall point of the inclusiveness argument.

1162
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,560
It is maybe a little more appropriate a name

1163
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,760
for a gathering of people and I don't really think

1164
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,960
there's anything wrong with naming something like that

1165
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,800
in the hopes it makes some people feel

1166
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,440
more recognized and included.

1167
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,600
It's just not a big deal.

1168
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,720
The argument seems fairly decent to me.

1169
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,600
So what is Dennis' rebuttal to this argument?

1170
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,400
Well, his problem is he doesn't really have one.

1171
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,920
He simply asks who is really being excluded

1172
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,560
and uses this to segue into an actually unrelated

1173
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,480
final point which we'll get to later

1174
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,840
but his actual rebuttal is provided

1175
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,600
in how he presents this argument

1176
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,200
which is that this entire argument is just a trick

1177
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,000
you shouldn't listen to at all.

1178
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Let's look at how he sets up the inclusiveness argument

1179
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,800
in the video.

1180
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,200
Activists on the left will eventually seek

1181
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,200
to remove Christmas as a national holiday.

1182
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,560
Now, the left doesn't announce that its agenda

1183
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,480
is to thoroughly secularize American and European societies.

1184
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,240
Instead, they offer the inclusiveness argument.

1185
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,600
The leftist secularists, an all-powerful cult,

1186
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,160
are trying to change the nature of America

1187
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,760
but they can't just walk around all day saying,

1188
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,240
I'm evil and want to destroy Christmas

1189
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,760
so they came up with this argument instead

1190
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,760
but it's not their real reason so you should ignore it.

1191
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,160
The argument might sound reasonable

1192
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,840
but you shouldn't think about it

1193
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,560
because they're bad and have an evil agenda.

1194
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,680
This masks the actual truth

1195
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,480
which is that the inclusiveness argument

1196
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,120
is actually fairly cogent.

1197
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,960
Dennis can't give a rebuttal to that

1198
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,800
because it's a really simple, small point

1199
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,320
that just makes sense

1200
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,720
but admitting that means conceding

1201
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,680
that sometimes it's nice to make people feel included

1202
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,080
which destroys the entire war on Christmas argument

1203
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,000
so instead, he reframes the argument as a fake trick

1204
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,800
by a group of people who want to remove religion from society

1205
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,880
who are only pretending to want people to feel included

1206
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,360
and this is how persecution complexes function

1207
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,400
in making people retain their ideas.

1208
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,280
If you make a decent enough argument

1209
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,080
that they can't give a rebuttal to,

1210
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,720
they can just fantasize about how it's a trick.

1211
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,400
This inclusive argument plays

1212
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,480
on Americans' highly developed sense of decency.

1213
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,800
They're just trying to play on your sense of decency

1214
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,680
as opposed to expecting you to do a really basic decent thing.

1215
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,040
It's all part of the secret secularist plot

1216
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,320
by the secularists to bring about their state religion,

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,680
that the left believes in secularism

1220
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,880
as fervently as religious Jews and Christians

1221
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,080

1250
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,560
that it was an American Jew, Irving Berlin,

1251
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,240
who wrote White Christmas,

1252
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,120
one of America's most popular Christmas songs.

1253
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,200
In fact, according to a Jewish musician

1254
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,360
writing in the New York Times,

1255
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,360
almost all the most popular Christmas songs

1256
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,400
were written by Jews.

1257
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,320
Apparently, all these American Jews

1258
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,640
felt quite included by Christmas.

1259
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,040
So there we go.

1260
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,400
Non-Christians will never feel excluded by Christmas

1261
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,840
because 70 years ago,

1262
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,040
a Jewish person wrote a song with Christmas in it.

1263
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,640
Dennis thinks this is a great point,

1264
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,080
and you can tell he thinks it's great

1265
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,480
because he wrote it into the script

1266
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,040
for this year's video about Christmas as well.

1267
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,400
And in perfect melting pot fashion,

1268
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,080
Irving Berlin, the son of a rabbi,

1269
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,120
wrote the definitive Yuletide song,

1270
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,160
White Christmas.

1271
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,360
Ah, it's such a clever point.

1272
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,080
You might as well use it twice.

1273
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,600
Unfortunately for Dennis,

1274
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,160
Irving Berlin didn't just write

1275
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,280
exactly one song about Christmas

1276
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,000
then disappear into the void.

1277
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,160
He actually lived on and wrote a few songs

1278
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,280
that might even be a bit inconvenient

1279
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,680
for Dennis' argument.

1280
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,560
He also composed a little ditty

1281
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,760
called Happy Holiday.

1282
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,080
That's right. The same guy behind White Christmas

1283
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,320
also wrote the other incredibly iconic Christmas song,

1284
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,760
the one that opened and closed

1285
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,400
Bing Crosby's big Christmas show for many years.

1286
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,920
Apparently, Irving Berlin wrote

1287
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,720
Happy Holidays into his lyrics

1288
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,360
because that's a completely normal thing to say,

1289
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,400
and the use of the phrase has nothing to do

1290
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,040
with political correctness.

1291
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,000
Incidentally, White Christmas was composed

1292
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,560
for a film called Holiday Inn,

1293
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,800
which also has Happy Holiday on the soundtrack.

1294
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,880
This fact isn't particularly meaningful here,

1295
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,040
but I thought it was funny.

1296
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,440
Dennis Prager obviously knows all this.

1297
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,080
If he knows about Irving Berlin,

1298
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,360
he surely knows his other popular songs

1299
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
and their titles.

1300
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,520
He's not stupid.

1301
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,560
He knows it's normal to say Happy Holidays at Christmas.

1302
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,040
It's impossible to miss this fact

1303
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,760
even if you do basic research.

1304
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,240
Hell, even one of the articles he cites in the video

1305
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,840
mentions that White Christmas was written for Holiday Inn,

1306
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,480
but for his videos, he performatively pretends

1307
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,680
these facts don't exist because PragerU

1308
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,720
is a fake university designed to sell

1309
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,560
a broken belief system so its donors can continue

1310
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,360
to profit from the status quo,

1311
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,440
and at the end of the day,

1312
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,080
isn't that what Christmas is all about?

1313
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,480
No. Well, it shouldn't be, but it is.

1314
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,680
Wow, with motion graphics,

1315
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,240
you can strawman people easily.

1316
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,360
Great idea, Dennis, but what are you gonna do

1317
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,280
if other people start doing it to you?

1318
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
Oh, his mouth fell off.

1319
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,240
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1320
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,720
See? I can say it,

1321
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,160
and I'm king of the male feminists,

1322
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,080
so clearly there's no problem here.

1323
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,440
Other people do have holidays around now though,

1324
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,000
so happy holidays might be more appropriate

1325
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,680
in some circumstances.

1326
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,120
Anyway, if you're angry

1327
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,440
and you need a reason to be angry to do with Christmas,

1328
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,600
go to therapy.

1329
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,200
Just go to therapy.

1330
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,960
If you're angry and you think it's because lesbians

1331
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,560
are in a Christmas thing,

1332
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,040
you're not actually angry

1333
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,000
because people are corrupting Christmas

1334
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,040
or infecting your traditions and culture.

1335
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,880
You're not even angry

1336
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,240
because of political correctness or leftism.

1337
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,560
You're angry because you feel expected to be,

1338
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,400
because you've built a cage for your mind,

1339
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,840
and the solution to that

1340
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,880
is to change things about yourself.

Sorry, there isn't anything wrong

We're not doing that.

We're not parodying a whole movie genre now.

if you know what they're referencing,

1361
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,480
so it's easy content,

1362
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,000
and you make videos slowly enough already.

1363
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,760
This way, half the script writes itself.

about the graph that I made for this video,

00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,560

00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,600

1404
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,560
I had a really bad year in 2018.

1405
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,920
I got out of this very long depression spiral

1406
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,400
and didn't really know what I was gonna do

1407
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,560
with my life after that,

1408
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,640
and I came out in early 2019 to discover

1409
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,920
that I somehow had this audience of people

1410
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,800
who thought what I did was good and meaningful

1411
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,360

1412
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,000
as a person for once,

1413
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,400
