00:00.000 --> 00:15.480
Oh, I'm definitely not going to get this video finished on time.

00:15.480 --> 00:19.520
Happy holidays, friends, enemies, frenemies and splenemies.

00:19.520 --> 00:45.440
Paris Bomberguy here, and I'll see you in the next video.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.140
Okay, right, I can explain.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.040
I recorded the Halloween segment of that video

00:49.040 --> 00:51.280
as a funny joke about how it takes me a while

00:51.280 --> 00:55.400
to make videos, and then I actually missed last Christmas.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.520
So here we are in the apocalypse.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.760
Let's all watch last year's Christmas video.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.740
This year, now that it's done,

01:03.740 --> 01:07.640
this means I technically got a seasonal video out on time,

01:07.640 --> 01:09.400
which means I'm good at my job.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.740
Fuck you.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.240
I'm just chilling out here in my house,

01:13.240 --> 01:16.180
enjoying the best that the clearance aisle had to offer.

01:16.180 --> 01:20.080
This Fortnite Funko Pop Tower Recon Specialist.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.080
Okay, this tasteful Coraline mug

01:23.080 --> 01:25.000
you can drink out of Coraline's head.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.800
Start off your morning routine with Coraline.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.440
Uh, not dishwasher or microwave safe.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.440
And this friend's makeup set where every color

01:33.440 --> 01:36.440
is a reference to a show that ended 15 years ago.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.120
Fukuyama was right.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.800
History ended in 2004 when Rachel got off the plane.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.200
And yes, I'm actually going to give this as a gift

01:44.200 --> 01:46.560
at my family's secret Santa this year.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.280
I guess you know who got you your gift, Luke.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.800
I hope you've seen friends.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.400
I also hope you'll stop being such a Ross.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.160
Ah, but the sad thing is,

01:55.160 --> 01:56.760
when I give my family these gifts,

01:56.760 --> 01:59.160
which are as good as they deserve, on Christmas Day,

01:59.160 --> 02:02.720
I won't even be allowed to say Merry Christmas as I do it

02:02.720 --> 02:07.040
because of the liberal, communist, atheist conspiracy

02:07.040 --> 02:10.600
to destroy the Christian religion by eroding its traditions.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.160
Political correctness, whoever that is,

02:13.160 --> 02:17.640
literally says it's racist to say Christmas now.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.000
At least that's what I reckon is happening.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.760
And that's the same thing as checking.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.440
Our culture is being crushed underfoot

02:24.440 --> 02:27.760
by radicals who want to destroy polite society

02:27.760 --> 02:29.520
to achieve their own ends.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.400
Oh, those hecking, gosh darned, flipping bastards.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.320
Christianity comes under attack.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.520
There's a war on Christmas.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.880
They outlawed Merry Christmas a few years ago,

02:39.880 --> 02:40.720
and you know it.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.640
Christmas becomes ever more about shallow displays

02:44.640 --> 02:46.280
of political correctness.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.280
Happy holidays, not Merry Christmas.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.400
Kids no longer have Christmas vacation, holiday vacation.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.520
Christmas parties, holiday parties.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.720
The war on Christmas.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.960
Whoever's watching this right now,

02:56.960 --> 02:58.240
think of something you love

02:58.240 --> 03:00.800
that brings you a sense of peace and decency,

03:00.800 --> 03:03.720
and they will somehow link it to the patriarchy

03:03.720 --> 03:06.400
and the rest of their politically correct nonsense.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.280
Christianity is being bigoted against.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.320
We're under attack.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.280
You couldn't even say Merry Christmas at Walmart.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.080
Obama said Merry Christmas a few times,

03:14.080 --> 03:16.320
but he still made sure to neuter the Christmas cards

03:16.320 --> 03:18.760
and also the Christmas decorations at the White House.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.760
What we're seeing happening has been a recent phenomenon,

03:21.760 --> 03:24.760
the war on Christmas, the war against religious liberty.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.680
Of course it's a war on Christmas.

03:26.680 --> 03:31.040
Christmas has lost all meaning thanks to cultural Marxism.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.280
Ah, it's those bloody cultural Marxists

03:33.280 --> 03:34.760
ruining everything again.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.800
That's why society's getting worse.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.920
It can't possibly be because of the policies

03:38.920 --> 03:40.760
of the people who keep getting elected.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.000
But don't worry, peace-loving citizens.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.080
I'm here to lead the charge in fighting back

03:45.080 --> 03:46.960
against these imaginary ghosts,

03:46.960 --> 03:50.160
so grab a slice of anonymous holiday meat

03:50.160 --> 03:53.480
and settle into your festive-season Anderson shelter

03:53.480 --> 03:56.040
before the political correctness bombs hit

03:56.040 --> 03:58.480
because it's time for the war on Christmas.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.920
Ooh, I won.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.280
Ho, ho, ho!

04:03.280 --> 04:04.680
Merry Chri-

04:04.680 --> 04:05.960
Whoa!

04:06.960 --> 04:08.440
In most Western countries,

04:08.440 --> 04:10.840
the winter season plays host to many religious

04:10.840 --> 04:12.120
and cultural traditions.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.520
Some people say the phrase,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.440
happy holidays, exists as a way of trying

04:15.440 --> 04:17.560
to be more inclusive to other people's traditions

04:17.560 --> 04:19.840
in the modern era, but this is inaccurate.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.120
I did literally five minutes of Googling

04:22.120 --> 04:25.800
and found happy holidays being used as far back as 1863,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.480
and who knows how far back further

04:27.480 --> 04:28.720
it would have turned out to have gone

04:28.720 --> 04:30.880
if I'd done any more research.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.000
It turns out that people like to have

04:33.000 --> 04:35.200
more than one phrase to say.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.920
It's why people put season's greetings on stuff.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.360
This isn't blasphemy. It's language.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.000
Did you know we've been writing X-mas

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
instead of Christmas for thousands of years?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.360
The X isn't trying to secularize the religion

04:46.360 --> 04:48.360
by removing the word Christ or something.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.440
It's actually the Greek letter chi,

04:50.440 --> 04:51.640
which has been a Christogram,

04:51.640 --> 04:53.320
an abbreviation of Jesus Christ,

04:53.320 --> 04:55.880
for about 1,700 years or something.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.120
I don't know. I'm not a religion...studier.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.960
An extremely popular song from 19-

05:00.960 --> 05:02.360
Theologian. That was the word.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.400
A very popular song from as far back as 1942

05:05.400 --> 05:06.560
was Happy Holiday.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.000
You might know this song or at least one

05:08.000 --> 05:09.720
of its 65 million covers.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.520
It was originally sung by Bing Crosby

05:11.520 --> 05:14.000
who was, by all accounts, a pretty devoted Catholic.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.560
Bing was one of the faces of Christmas for decades.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.360
His Christmas radio broadcasts were hugely popular.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.800
That song was the opening and closing theme

05:21.800 --> 05:23.880
of his Christmas Sing with Bing program

05:23.880 --> 05:26.640
which aired every Christmas Eve for almost 10 years.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.400
So sure, happy holidays is a useful catch-all term

05:29.400 --> 05:31.800
since there are a lot of holidays going on.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.760
Makes sense to use it in some contexts,

05:33.760 --> 05:36.080
but saying it isn't actually a new phenomenon.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.000
It's been a normal thing for Christians

05:38.000 --> 05:40.360
to say to each other for many years,

05:40.360 --> 05:42.560
and that piece of knowledge is one of the finest gifts

05:42.560 --> 05:43.800
I can bring.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.080
Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.160
Peace on Earth!

05:48.160 --> 05:50.360
These are all indisputable and quite interesting

05:50.360 --> 05:51.760
historical facts,

05:51.760 --> 05:55.040
but not everyone puts the truth on their Christmas list.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.840
Some people want to open their stockings

05:56.840 --> 05:59.800
and find an explanation for why they're angry all the time.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.240
The big originator of the War on Christmas theory

06:02.240 --> 06:03.400
is Bill O'Reilly.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.240
I couldn't find footage of Bill's original

06:05.240 --> 06:06.480
War on Christmas segment,

06:06.480 --> 06:08.440
but handily, the script Bill reads from

06:08.440 --> 06:10.360
in these segments was posted as an article

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
on Fox's website.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.240
The segment was titled Christmas Under Siege

06:14.240 --> 06:15.920
in which he made exaggerated claims

06:15.920 --> 06:17.520
about how various holiday parades

06:17.520 --> 06:19.360
were doing away with Christmas floats,

06:19.360 --> 06:22.280
New York has a holiday tree instead of a Christmas tree,

06:22.280 --> 06:24.520
and how Macy's stopped greeting people

06:24.520 --> 06:25.840
with Merry Christmas.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.560
They said a different thing!

06:27.560 --> 06:29.320
O'Reilly then went on to fantasize

06:29.320 --> 06:30.480
that this was part of a plot

06:30.480 --> 06:32.680
to diminish people's faith in religion,

06:32.680 --> 06:33.960
saying that, quote-unquote,

06:33.960 --> 06:36.600
secular progressives wanted to destroy

06:36.600 --> 06:38.760
religious oppositions to their policies

06:38.760 --> 06:42.520
such as gay marriage, abortion, and drug legalization,

06:42.520 --> 06:44.960
and to bring about this horrible nightmare future,

06:44.960 --> 06:48.800
it was important to destroy religion in the public arena.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.240
Thus, Christian displays like Christmas must be scaled back

06:52.240 --> 06:54.680
because the connection with Judeo-Christian beliefs

06:54.680 --> 06:56.600
is bad for the secular agenda.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.040
Ah, yes, the famously Judeo-Christian belief

07:00.040 --> 07:01.400
in Christmas.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.960
The secular movement has influence in the media,

07:03.960 --> 07:06.120
among some judges and politicians.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.920
Americans will lose their country

07:07.920 --> 07:09.640
if they don't begin to take action.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.400
Any assault on Judeo-Christian philosophy

07:12.400 --> 07:13.520
should be fought.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.760
Organizations like thomasmoore.org

07:15.760 --> 07:17.760
and the Alliance Defense Fund in Phoenix

07:17.760 --> 07:20.240
are fighting back but need your help.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.920
The USA cannot defeat terrorism

07:22.920 --> 07:25.720
and any other evil without a strong,

07:25.760 --> 07:28.200
traditional foundation that clearly defines

07:28.200 --> 07:29.400
right from wrong.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.320
The struggle today is not about Christmas

07:32.320 --> 07:34.920
but about the spirit of our country.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.960
Ahem.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.800
Bill is writing about how Macy's say a different thing now.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.880
It's basically the conservative version of slam poetry.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.240
Take something that technically has happened

07:46.240 --> 07:48.120
and then contort it until it's an attack

07:48.120 --> 07:50.040
on the very soul of our society

07:50.040 --> 07:51.960
and we need to defend ourselves,

07:51.960 --> 07:53.800
and that's why we need your attention

07:53.840 --> 07:55.760
and the money we'll get from our sponsors

07:55.760 --> 07:59.160
for getting eyes on their peppermint-flavored Play-Doh

07:59.160 --> 08:01.600
or ribbed-for-her-pleasure coffee machines.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.560
Bill's early rhetoric forms the basis

08:03.560 --> 08:04.920
for all the madness to come.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.000
It's always stores not saying Christmas as much,

08:08.000 --> 08:08.920
stuff like that.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.320
Holiday wish list?

08:10.320 --> 08:11.240
Oh, no.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.840
God is dead and we have killed him.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.680
The other side outnumbers them.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.240
I mean, Christian, Judeo, Christian,

08:19.240 --> 08:20.680
people who believe in that philosophy

08:20.680 --> 08:22.400
outnumber the secularists,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.440
maybe six to seven to one.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.320
Oh, my religion has more subscribers than yours.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.200
By the end of his tenure, Bill was straight up

08:29.200 --> 08:31.040
just saying the names of companies

08:31.040 --> 08:33.280
which were trying to slit the throat of Christmas.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.160
Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Foot Locker,

08:37.160 --> 08:42.000
The Gap, The Limited, Nordstrom,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.440
shopping on Amazon.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.400
This year's list was handily provided to Bill

08:45.400 --> 08:49.280
by the American Family Association.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.440
The AFA website is a series of articles

08:51.440 --> 08:53.480
about how only the left does violence

08:53.480 --> 08:55.840
because they've never heard of mass shooting statistics,

08:55.840 --> 08:59.360
LGBT people are the real bullies because, uh,

08:59.360 --> 09:01.760
a woman refused to accept her children were trans

09:01.760 --> 09:03.680
and they stopped wanting to talk to her,

09:03.680 --> 09:05.680
Hallmark and Chick-fil-A are the devil now

09:05.680 --> 09:07.280
because they showed a lesbian wedding

09:07.280 --> 09:08.520
in a commercial or something,

09:08.520 --> 09:10.160
and how VeggieTales is back.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
Oh, and also tons of war on Christmas bullshit

09:12.480 --> 09:14.600
verbatim stealing Bill's old schtick.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.800
Three guys you've never heard of discuss the secular push

09:17.800 --> 09:20.880
to scrub away the root word of Christ in Christmas.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.640
There was a war on Christmas we were noticing.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.640
Some people may say,

09:24.640 --> 09:26.560
well, that's not really a big deal, is it?

09:26.560 --> 09:30.520
Well, we thought it was part of the secularist push

09:30.520 --> 09:34.040
to scrub all references to Christianity from our culture.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard all this before.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.160
The secularists want to destroy Christianity

09:38.160 --> 09:41.280
and they're doing it by rewording a few things at Christmas

09:41.280 --> 09:43.960
but the AFA, unlike Fox, don't have advertisers.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.400
They survive through donations

09:45.400 --> 09:47.360
and selling things on their website

09:47.360 --> 09:49.240
and you bet they've got a way of capitalizing

09:49.240 --> 09:50.640
on the war on Christmas.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.400
They want you to buy a button that reminds people

09:53.400 --> 09:55.280
that Jesus Christ exists.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.640
Well, it is the Christmas season

09:57.640 --> 10:01.720
and we've got these buttons that we are offering.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.080
Honestly, how can people know

10:03.080 --> 10:05.280
you're a real member of the Jesus fan club

10:05.280 --> 10:07.440
if you aren't repping his holy merch?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.680
You can get your 10-pack of these buttons for $15

10:11.680 --> 10:14.680
and just go to afa.net.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.880
Is it AFA store?

10:15.880 --> 10:16.720
AFA?

10:16.720 --> 10:17.560
Either one.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.800
Afastore.net, afastore.net.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.840
Which brings us to the AFA's yearly naughty or nice list.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.720
One of the most deludedly self-righteous lists

10:25.720 --> 10:28.480
I've ever read and I've read my top 10 games

10:28.480 --> 10:29.560
of the decade list.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.000
Both versions of Dark Souls II are on there out of spite.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.840
Fuck you.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.120
We are not friends.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.120
Click on any naughty company name

10:37.120 --> 10:39.040
for details and contact information.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.040
They want you to send emails to some guy

10:41.040 --> 10:43.200
who works at Office Depot to try to get them

10:43.200 --> 10:44.960
to write Christmas on things more.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.680
If a company has items associated with Christmas

10:47.680 --> 10:49.600
but did not use the word Christmas,

10:49.600 --> 10:52.680
then the company is considered as censoring Christmas.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.800
That's the rubric.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.720
If you sell me a cracker at Christmas

10:55.720 --> 10:57.720
but you don't call it a Christmas cracker,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.360
you're a secularist terrorist

10:59.360 --> 11:01.760
who's trying to stab the Christmas family.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.040
For many years, Bill, with the help of the AFA,

11:04.040 --> 11:06.760
was the reigning champion of the fight to save Christmas.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.920
He was the only man standing up to defend Christian values,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.520
which are the reason he knows right from wrong so well.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.720
But then in 2017, he got fired

11:14.720 --> 11:16.440
for allegedly sexually harassing

11:16.440 --> 11:18.840
at least six of his female co-workers.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.160
So Bill wasn't exactly a great follower

11:21.160 --> 11:22.720
of his religious teachings, was he?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.760
It's very clear why the war on Christmas argument

11:24.760 --> 11:25.960
is so attention-grabbing.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.560
It's telling people that their religion is under attack

11:28.560 --> 11:30.480
and we need those traditional values

11:30.480 --> 11:33.440
or our country will fall to terrorism or other evil.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.040
People will pay attention to your show

11:35.040 --> 11:36.280
when you say things like that,

11:36.280 --> 11:37.840
which leads to increased viewership

11:37.840 --> 11:40.320
and higher value of your advertising spots.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.600
You might even get people to buy a button

11:42.600 --> 11:44.360
or get some wealthy cretins

11:44.360 --> 11:46.600
to donate comical amounts of money to you.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.440
However, I don't think this alone

11:48.440 --> 11:51.040
gets to the true core of why this belief survives

11:51.040 --> 11:53.800
so well in the minds of more extreme conservatives,

11:53.800 --> 11:55.680
so we're gonna have to go deeper,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.000
and then it says in brackets,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.440
Inception Horn Noise.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.840
Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.040
Maybe to understand this line of thinking further,

12:02.040 --> 12:04.920
we need to go in search of even more ridiculously false

12:04.920 --> 12:07.720
and silly versions and see how it functions there.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.440
First, I want to start off with a central theme

12:10.440 --> 12:13.480
which is the war on Christmas.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
Oh, hi, Paul.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.720
In this classic video from 2017,

12:16.720 --> 12:18.120
which is a yearly rewatch for me,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.720
it's just a hilarious shambles in so many ways,

12:20.720 --> 12:23.200
Paul Joseph Watson spends 15 minutes

12:23.200 --> 12:25.360
of what's left of his life,

12:25.360 --> 12:26.600
and you only get one life.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.080
This is it, complaining that there's a Tesco commercial

12:29.080 --> 12:31.040
with too much diversity in it.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.320
They called it a Christmas ad,

12:32.320 --> 12:34.080
or at least it was supposed to be that.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.640
Didn't have any symbols of Christianity

12:36.640 --> 12:38.200
in the ad whatsoever.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.840
It did have a gay couple, hijabi Muslims,

12:41.840 --> 12:43.400
all this other goth.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.840
No actual Christian symbol

12:45.840 --> 12:48.120
because, of course, we can't have that anymore, can we?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.480
At least, like, put a vicar in it or something.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.840
A cross. Anything Christian.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.600
It's a Christmas ad for God's sake.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.040
All right, fine, Paul. I'll see what I can do.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.360
Ah, approved for broadcast in InfoWars land.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.920
Wait, Paul also stipulated that a religious figure

13:02.920 --> 13:04.600
would suffice. Okay, how about this?

13:04.600 --> 13:08.440
Hey, guys, that was the College of Cardinals on the phone.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.280
I've just been elected pope.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.080
There, is that religious enough for you?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.120
And if that's not good enough,

13:13.120 --> 13:15.640
I bet I can undo some more catechisms.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.200
Ah, but hang on a second.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.840
It's easy to make fun of Paul.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.240
He's made sure of that,

13:20.240 --> 13:21.920
but let's seriously look at the idea

13:21.920 --> 13:24.200
there is some kind of manipulation happening

13:24.200 --> 13:25.840
with the lack of Christian iconography

13:25.840 --> 13:28.600
in this commercial because this begs a deeper question

13:28.600 --> 13:30.960
which is should Christmas commercials

13:30.960 --> 13:33.000
prominently display Christian stuff

13:33.000 --> 13:34.600
like crosses and priests

13:34.600 --> 13:36.880
because I haven't seen a convincing argument

13:36.880 --> 13:38.880
that the answer to that question is yes

13:38.880 --> 13:40.680
because even in commercials long before

13:40.680 --> 13:42.640
the supposed war on Christmas,

13:42.640 --> 13:45.160
you can still see a seemingly deliberate choice

13:45.160 --> 13:47.840
not to explicitly invoke Christianity

13:47.840 --> 13:50.480
even when the intended audience would be mostly Christian

13:50.480 --> 13:52.680
because it turns out Christians have been having

13:52.680 --> 13:54.960
this exact discussion for a long time now

13:54.960 --> 13:58.000
even before anyone knew what political correctness was.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.640
Historically, plenty of Christians have found

14:00.640 --> 14:03.120
that their religion being tied to a product

14:03.120 --> 14:06.400
being sold to them is kind of crass and disgusting.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.600
There's a Fox & Friends segment from a few years ago

14:08.600 --> 14:11.120
that highlights this discrepancy in an amazing way.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.280
They had a real Catholic priest on

14:13.320 --> 14:15.360
to discuss the war on Christmas

14:15.360 --> 14:17.400
but despite how hard they tried to push him,

14:17.400 --> 14:20.280
he wasn't annoyed that things weren't Christian enough.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.040
You'd be fine if it said Merry Christmas

14:23.040 --> 14:24.680
but it doesn't. It says Happy Holidays

14:24.680 --> 14:27.280
or things are simply red or green.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.880
Well, it's not so much that that bothers me.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.560
It's more that the consumerism

14:30.560 --> 14:32.840
and the pressure to just shop, shop, shop.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.120
He was much more concerned with how consumerism

14:35.120 --> 14:37.760
had eroded the religious meaning of the holiday.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.480
It's more the consumerism I think that's a problem for me.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.120
All right, so let's take a look at some of the stores

14:42.120 --> 14:44.000
that have taken Christmas out of their mottos.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
J.Crew.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.040
You can see the Fox people had really planned

14:47.040 --> 14:48.880
for a very different kind of interview.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.960
They'd prepared a graphic all about the mottos

14:50.960 --> 14:52.520
that didn't say Christmas anymore

14:52.520 --> 14:54.560
but not everyone is interested in fabricating

14:54.560 --> 14:56.320
a culture war for attention.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.920
Some people actually want to think about things.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.600
I guess it bothers me that they're using, uh,

15:01.600 --> 15:04.760
sort of, uh, overtly Christian, uh, tropes and themes

15:04.760 --> 15:06.920
like Believe and Merry and things like that

15:06.920 --> 15:08.480
that are associated with Christmas

15:08.480 --> 15:10.000
but they're using it to just market goods.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Now, I don't think it's intentional.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.200
I think it's just a way to appeal

15:12.200 --> 15:13.320
to as many people as possible

15:13.320 --> 15:15.360
but it really kind of denudes, uh,

15:15.360 --> 15:17.560
the holiday of, uh, any sort of religious import.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.720
And it seems that for many devout Christians

15:19.720 --> 15:21.560
the concern isn't that commercials

15:21.560 --> 15:22.920
aren't Christian enough.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.320
It's the exact opposite,

15:24.320 --> 15:26.400
that commercials are leaning a bit too heavily

15:26.400 --> 15:29.720
on Christian ideas and themes in order to sell products.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.800
But the Catholic Church is notoriously full

15:31.800 --> 15:33.080
of commie scumbags.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.760
It just hasn't been the same since the Byzantine Papacy.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.960
You don't have to get it. Don't worry.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.800
Sometimes you write jokes just for you.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.080
Now, I'm not a fancy big time Christian boy

15:41.080 --> 15:44.240
but maybe commercializing the religious aspect

15:44.240 --> 15:48.040
of Christmas in order to sell people things is bad

15:48.040 --> 15:50.480
and the more generic holiday themes in stores

15:50.480 --> 15:52.880
and commercials is a good way of respecting

15:52.880 --> 15:54.680
Christians' religious traditions

15:54.680 --> 15:57.760
and it's been that way since long before 2017.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.360
Paul's whole narrative here is based on the assumption

16:00.360 --> 16:02.880
that commercials loved to invoke Christianity

16:02.880 --> 16:05.080
until Twitter invented social justice

16:05.080 --> 16:09.160
but as we've seen, this assumption is objectively false

16:09.160 --> 16:12.200
and inventing an imaginary past that's been stolen

16:12.200 --> 16:16.120
to justify present foolishness is a real Rachel move.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.520
Regina Phalange.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.240
Facts and data are inconvenient for Paul

16:20.240 --> 16:21.600
so he doesn't like to bring them up

16:21.600 --> 16:23.880
but I saw something interesting that I thought was relevant

16:23.880 --> 16:25.800
so I'm gonna talk about it while I have the chance.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.560
There's a great paper by the National Center

16:27.560 --> 16:29.640
for Social Research which has been gathering data

16:29.640 --> 16:31.200
about how people approach their religion

16:31.200 --> 16:32.640
for about 35 years now

16:32.640 --> 16:34.520
and what they discovered is quite interesting.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.280
In the last 30 years, less and less people identify

16:37.280 --> 16:39.760
as Christian, at least according to the most accurate data.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.480
This corresponds with an increase in people

16:41.480 --> 16:44.360
identifying specifically as unreligious or atheist.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.720
Since the 2010s, there's been decisively more

16:46.720 --> 16:49.040
non-religious people in Britain than Christians even.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.040
Most of these people probably still celebrate

16:51.040 --> 16:51.960
Christian traditions.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.640
They're a common part of English culture.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.800
I'm an atheist and I still celebrate Christmas

16:55.800 --> 16:57.800
but all these folks probably aren't putting crosses

16:57.800 --> 16:59.280
anywhere in their houses and really,

16:59.280 --> 17:01.560
who's to say that that's what Christians do?

17:01.560 --> 17:03.920
Not everyone thinks that celebrating their faith

17:03.920 --> 17:05.800
requires putting a cross in their house.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.520
People's relationships with their religion

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
aren't that simple.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.360
There's no Christmas handbook

17:10.360 --> 17:13.080
mandating you hang a cross up for the Yuletide.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.040
In fact, the actual Christian handbook

17:15.040 --> 17:17.480
seems to prioritize worshiping in private

17:17.480 --> 17:20.840
unlike those darn pagans who love to babble on and on.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.520
What a weird thing to specify.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.960
I guess what I'm trying to say is for most people,

17:24.960 --> 17:27.160
this commercial is an accurate representation

17:27.160 --> 17:28.880
of how people behave at Christmas.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.440
It's just not about throwing crosses around, you know?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.520
But while we're on the topic of representation,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.680
I can't help but notice the specific lack

17:35.680 --> 17:37.920
of lightsabers or delicious space milk

17:37.920 --> 17:39.440
anywhere in this commercial

17:39.440 --> 17:41.480
even though according to census data,

17:41.480 --> 17:44.560
almost 1% of Britons self-identify as Jedi.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.160
Probably not after this Christmas though.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.040
No! Stop it! No!

17:49.040 --> 17:51.000
Paul's rant kind of goes on for a while.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.080
He doesn't really have a point he's getting to

17:53.080 --> 17:55.760
so much as he's mad a commercial has Muslims in it

17:55.760 --> 17:56.760
for a few seconds.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.360
He's mad it's a Twitter moment

17:58.360 --> 18:00.360
and some people are applauding the diversity.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.520
He's sure that a YouTube video being brigaded

18:02.520 --> 18:04.920
by his followers and getting a couple of thousand dislikes

18:04.920 --> 18:08.000
indicates actually it's very unpopular and so on.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.080
You can even see in his face that he's struggling

18:10.080 --> 18:13.200
to really articulate a decent justification to be angry.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.040
Of course, there was a backlash to the backlash

18:16.040 --> 18:19.880
which basically peaked yesterday with Twitter.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.160
Twitter came out and said this was one of their

18:22.160 --> 18:24.720
featured stories in their Twitter moments

18:24.720 --> 18:26.680
which of course is on the homepage

18:26.680 --> 18:28.400
when anybody goes onto Twitter.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.800
Ha ha ha! Imagine this being your life.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.000
It's stuff like this that really gives context

18:34.000 --> 18:36.440
to tweets where he's mad at black celebrities

18:36.440 --> 18:37.960
talking about racism,

18:37.960 --> 18:40.840
calling them sanctimonious crybabies.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.600
Saying Britain still has racism is annoying.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.400
What's way more important and pressing

18:45.400 --> 18:47.280
is the Tesco Christmas commercial.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.760
He's also very sure this stuff

18:48.760 --> 18:50.960
isn't Bill O'Reilly nonsense anymore.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.480
It used to be, but it's real now.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.280
It's no longer some Bill O'Reilly meme

18:56.280 --> 18:57.600
when it's actually happening.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.160
He keeps saying this over and over.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.960
It's like boomer dubstep.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.800
Now, I remember 10, 15 years ago,

19:02.800 --> 19:05.000
this is something that Bill O'Reilly,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.400
these other neocons would constantly bring up.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.000
People would debunk it and say it's a false concern.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.200
It's being exaggerated.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.640
There's no war on Christmas.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.920
What are you talking about? This is crazy.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.520
Well, fast forward to 2017.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.160
Everything Bill O'Reilly said, yeah, that was crazy,

19:22.160 --> 19:25.480
but fast forward to the Tesco Christmas commercial.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.040
The thing about Info Wars videos

19:27.040 --> 19:29.280
which are recorded live on the actual show,

19:29.280 --> 19:30.720
the ones where Alex is also there

19:30.720 --> 19:32.400
and Paul's just calling in,

19:32.400 --> 19:36.080
is that Paul is fundamentally not a very good live speaker.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.880
I'm not saying this because I disagree

19:37.880 --> 19:40.480
with his political views or to make fun of him.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.720
He's a poor public speaker.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.760
It's just not one of his skills, and that's fine.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.640
Some people are just too self-conscious for it.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.480
That's why he writes his videos in advance

19:47.480 --> 19:50.400
and edits them with snappy cuts and always is yelling.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.240
It makes his work hold people's attention,

19:52.240 --> 19:54.800
but he just can't maintain that energy in a live setting.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.480
Worse, his clear anxieties about what he's doing

19:57.480 --> 20:00.120
start to come through when the spotlight's on him too long.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.200
Sometimes he workshops his tweets in the pub

20:02.200 --> 20:04.080
with his friends before he posts them.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.080
No, I'm serious.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.800
He shows the tweet on his phone to his friends and asks,

20:07.800 --> 20:09.400
is this okay? Should I post it?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.760
Looking for some kind of approval

20:10.760 --> 20:12.400
with an anxious look on his face.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.640
And it's a tweet petulantly quoting Stormzy out of context

20:15.640 --> 20:18.240
in order to imply that he hates all white people,

20:18.240 --> 20:20.680
and his remaining real-life friends nod and go,

20:20.680 --> 20:22.040
yeah, sure, man.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.480
I don't get why it's a big deal to you,

20:23.480 --> 20:25.320
but I guess it's for your job, right?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
And then one of them sends me a message about it later.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.400
But anyway, my point is Paul isn't that great

20:29.400 --> 20:31.400
at this whole live entertainment thing,

20:31.400 --> 20:33.160
and there's a reason Alex Jones uses him

20:33.160 --> 20:35.280
as sporadically as he can on his shows.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.560
He's only got about five things to say,

20:37.560 --> 20:39.560
and he has to keep saying them over and over.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.080
So eventually Alex realizes he needs to jump in

20:42.080 --> 20:44.280
and starts interrupting him with points of his own.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.240
It's a Christmas ad for God's sake,

20:46.240 --> 20:47.240
but here's the kicker.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.480
It's like having a Christmas ad

20:48.480 --> 20:50.840
where you drag Santa Claus behind a car.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.520
Yeah, there'd be newspaper articles about it all week.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.320
Well, Paul, this is cultural appropriation.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.520
This is what the left's all about, is overriding,

20:58.520 --> 21:01.160
taking control of everything, dominating culture.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.560
All the headlines are like,

21:02.560 --> 21:04.520
oh, you're so offended at seeing Muslims.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.720
It's like, no, I'm offended at the fact,

21:06.720 --> 21:08.920
or I'm perplexed at the fact there's no...

21:08.920 --> 21:10.680
It'd be like if you had an ad saying,

21:10.680 --> 21:13.840
this holiday season, support Ramadan

21:13.840 --> 21:15.640
at your local halal stores,

21:15.640 --> 21:18.360
and then it showed guys in Knights Templar uniforms

21:18.360 --> 21:19.840
at the Muslim store.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.200
The Muslim store.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
The other big claim he's making in this war on Christmas bit

21:24.600 --> 21:25.920
also has to do with Tesco.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.640
Paul went to a Tesco's and noticed, to his horror,

21:28.640 --> 21:30.440
that not enough things said Christmas,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.360
so he whipped out his phone and took some pictures

21:32.360 --> 21:34.280
to complain about on Twitter later.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.600
There's a funny bit in this video

21:35.600 --> 21:37.440
where Alex says he should have documented it,

21:37.440 --> 21:39.560
not realizing Paul already had.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.880
They've got these Christmas cards, Alex.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.880
They call them, they've renamed them.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.200
They're now called charity cards.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.960
Paul, you gotta go back in and get some footage of this.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.480
Well, I've got the pictures and I tweeted them,

21:51.480 --> 21:52.640
but people said...

21:52.640 --> 21:54.560
Just incredibly poor communication

21:54.560 --> 21:55.680
going on at InfoWars.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.640
The tweets themselves are really something.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.520
Was in Tesco earlier.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.440
Their entire...

22:00.440 --> 22:01.280
I can't do his voice.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.600
Their entire Christmas shelf,

22:02.600 --> 22:04.680
cards, wrapping paper, confectionery,

22:04.680 --> 22:07.560
not a single mention of the word Christmas.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.400
Not a single one.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.600
Christmas cards are now called charity cards.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.760
Pathetic.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.120
Truly pathetic.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.120
Then he atted Tesco.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.640
Yeah, this is Tesco speaking.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.680
I'm sorry, Paul.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.880
We'll put Christmas on the crack.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.480
And before all you pointy heads claim

22:25.480 --> 22:27.000
they're called charity cards

22:27.000 --> 22:29.120
because some proceeds go to charity,

22:29.120 --> 22:30.480
that's always been the case,

22:30.480 --> 22:32.760
but they were still called Christmas cards.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.520
It's not just the commercial.

22:34.520 --> 22:39.000
At Tesco has capitulated to politically correct douchebaggery.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.760
And then there's a picture of some crackers

22:40.760 --> 22:42.600
and they're just called crackers.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.840
You know, because that's their name.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.400
They're not even calling them Christmas crackers anymore.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.120
The war on Christmas used to be some far right,

22:50.120 --> 22:52.120
evangelical, Bill O'Reilly.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.520
Jesus Christ, Paul, we get it.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.560
You don't have to say it that many times.

22:55.560 --> 22:56.880
Truly saddening.

22:56.880 --> 22:57.920
After all these years,

22:57.920 --> 23:01.200
Tesco have finally started the war on Christmas for real.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.640
There's no Christmas anywhere in Tesco anymore.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.440
Not a single one.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.120
However, eagle-eyed viewers,

23:08.120 --> 23:10.080
well, frankly, eyed viewers

23:10.080 --> 23:11.640
who take a look at the photograph

23:11.640 --> 23:12.920
for more than a nanosecond

23:12.920 --> 23:15.960
might start to notice things Paul somehow didn't notice

23:15.960 --> 23:18.160
when he was literally standing there looking at them.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.760
For example, if you zoom in on one of his own pictures,

23:20.760 --> 23:22.360
you can actually see Merry Christmas

23:22.360 --> 23:23.880
written on some of the crackers.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.640
Some people went into their local Tesco

23:25.640 --> 23:27.760
and found that Christmas was written everywhere.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.880
Some people pointed out that these charity cards

23:29.880 --> 23:32.440
were in a display marked Christmas cards

23:32.440 --> 23:35.040
and still others looked at packs of these charity cards

23:35.040 --> 23:37.360
and found that some of them say Merry Christmas on them.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.960
Tesco also has Christmas all over its website

23:39.960 --> 23:42.120
where it happens to refer to the charity cards

23:42.120 --> 23:44.160
as charity Christmas cards.

23:44.160 --> 23:47.240
The website also refers to crackers as Christmas crackers.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.880
Not a single one.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.840
These things were mentioned to Paul immediately

23:50.840 --> 23:53.320
in response to the tweets when he made them a few years ago

23:53.320 --> 23:55.440
and good fun was had by all laughing

23:55.440 --> 23:57.320
at this sad middle-aged man

23:57.320 --> 23:59.440
taking pictures in Tesco to whine about.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.240
By far the funniest bit of this video

24:01.240 --> 24:03.280
is when they cut to a feed of Paul's tweet thread

24:03.280 --> 24:05.440
about the Tesco stuff and when they're scrolling down,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.080
they accidentally scroll to the tweet

24:07.080 --> 24:09.520
pointing out Christmas is literally on the packaging

24:09.520 --> 24:12.160
and then whoever's doing the screen capture panics,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.240
zooms out, and scrolls down one more

24:14.240 --> 24:16.920
and it's the one pointing out Christmas is on the website

24:16.920 --> 24:19.480
and they just have to awkwardly fade back to Paul

24:19.480 --> 24:20.800
saying it's not all made up.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.200
This is definitely real.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.040
Now, I mean, this is not some kind of Bill O'Reilly meme

24:26.040 --> 24:28.240
from the early 2000s anymore.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.560
This is actually happening.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.760
No, I get it, Paul. It's not just Bill O'Reilly anymore.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.400
You made that point already. Move on.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.840
This is a deliberate Orwellian process

24:36.840 --> 24:39.840
of eliminating words, changing language

24:39.840 --> 24:43.080
for the purposes of some lame nod at political correctness.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.720
Okay, some of you might be confused at this point

24:44.720 --> 24:45.960
so let's just get this straight.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.320
The far left who, as we all know, run Tesco

24:49.320 --> 24:51.360
are trying to undermine culture

24:51.360 --> 24:53.560
because they're worried about sounding racist

24:53.560 --> 24:56.840
so they're doing this by not letting stores

24:56.840 --> 24:59.760
put Christmas anywhere except in the stores,

24:59.760 --> 25:02.880
the products in the stores, and on the website.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.720
There, sorted. See?

25:04.720 --> 25:06.720
It's the Marxists at it again.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.680
I went into Tesco on Saturday,

25:09.680 --> 25:12.760
went to the Christmas section of the store.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.600
Not one mention of Christmas.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.520
They don't even mention the word Christmas.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.160
Paul, of course they did.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.200
That's how you know it's the Christmas section!

25:21.200 --> 25:23.720
That's why every year I know exactly where the elves are.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.480
You can't hide from me.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.840
Now, there is one minor thing worth talking about here.

25:27.840 --> 25:31.680
One teensy, tiny thing that Paul might not have thought about

25:31.680 --> 25:34.040
which is that one of the reasons why Christmas

25:34.040 --> 25:36.240
isn't written on everything is because you already know

25:36.240 --> 25:37.520
it's for Christmas.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.640
All the Christmas stuff is only in stores

25:39.640 --> 25:42.960
in the Christmas season for you to buy for Christmas.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.960
They're neatly arranged in special red aisles

25:45.960 --> 25:48.560
so you know where to look for the Christmas stuff.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.640
Putting Christmas on every single thing is just pointless.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.280
This isn't even to do with political correctness.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.040
It's just basic store design.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.920
They don't feel the need to acknowledge Christmas

25:58.920 --> 26:01.720
on the label because Christmas is being acknowledged

26:01.720 --> 26:04.240
at every other point in this transaction.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.240
Oh, no, the label of this wrapping paper

26:06.240 --> 26:08.160
doesn't say Christmas wrapping paper.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.120
Help, I'm being tricked into forgetting my religion exists.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.760
Oh, Christmas is written all over the fucking wrapping paper?

26:14.760 --> 26:17.920
Oh, well, I guess I'll celebrate Christmas again this year.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.520
God, the cultural Marxists had better get their act together

26:20.520 --> 26:21.920
if they're gonna win this war.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.960
Ugh, ah, fuck, ugh.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.440
Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.600
There, that's probably structurally stable, right?

26:29.600 --> 26:31.920
Now, one might say, ah, it's not fair

26:31.920 --> 26:34.400
to go after an old InfoWars video.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.080
What if InfoWars have spontaneously become smart

26:37.080 --> 26:39.720
and rational now and cleverly moved on

26:39.720 --> 26:42.120
from a topic that they got obliterated on

26:42.120 --> 26:44.720
when people looked at their own photos?

26:44.720 --> 26:46.200
Well, yeah, they did.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.520
They dropped the topic and decided to move on

26:48.520 --> 26:50.240
to doing real journalism.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.880
I'm kidding, they did another one this year.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.800
Alex Jones goes to the Texas state capital

26:54.800 --> 26:57.360
to witness the city of Austin's Christmas tree

26:57.360 --> 27:00.000
and expose the anti-Christian agenda

27:00.000 --> 27:01.760
hidden in plain sight.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.560
The banner beneath the tree that reads,

27:03.560 --> 27:04.720
Happy Holidays.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.200
Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.840
Merry Christmas.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.560
And it's about Jesus Christ.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.600
It's not about the big corporations

27:12.600 --> 27:15.200
and the chi-com atheists and the globalists.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.160
I think the existence of videos like this

27:17.160 --> 27:19.400
really crystallizes what the war on Christmas

27:19.400 --> 27:20.760
is actually about.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.480
Bullshit artists like InfoWars

27:22.480 --> 27:23.960
have to play a very careful game

27:23.960 --> 27:25.240
to survive and make money.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.440
InfoWars can't make money as a news website

27:27.440 --> 27:29.400
because they don't actually do any journalism

27:29.400 --> 27:30.840
so no one comes to them for that

27:30.840 --> 27:32.440
and they can't easily sell advertisements

27:32.440 --> 27:33.640
on their website or videos

27:33.640 --> 27:35.240
because for unknown reasons,

27:35.240 --> 27:37.600
barely anyone wants to be associated with them.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.480
It starts out with, don't use the N-word.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.880
Well, I don't use that, so okay.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.040
And the next it's, oh, don't say Merry Christmas.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
Say Happy Holidays.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.240
Yeah, those are the same thing.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.760
Eh, I never thought of it that way.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.480
Imagine a shoe company looking for somewhere to advertise

27:49.480 --> 27:50.680
and seeing one of these videos

27:50.680 --> 27:51.760
and it's Alex Jones going,

27:51.760 --> 27:52.880
remember when they tricked us

27:52.880 --> 27:54.720
into not saying the N-word anymore?

27:54.720 --> 27:56.600
Well, Happy Holidays is just like that.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.720
They're probably gonna say no

27:57.720 --> 27:59.120
but Alex Jones has this problem

27:59.120 --> 28:02.040
which is that he really, really likes expensive watches.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.760
He loves to wear Rolexes on his show

28:03.760 --> 28:05.040
and according to court records,

28:05.040 --> 28:07.440
he once bought four of them in a single day.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.360
The cheapest one I could find him wearing

28:09.360 --> 28:11.400
cost around $12,000.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.440
So obviously he needs a lot of money to live

28:13.440 --> 28:15.040
and how's he gonna do that?

28:15.040 --> 28:17.720
Why, he'd have to develop some kind of business model

28:17.720 --> 28:20.160
that revolves around exploiting gullible people.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.560
So their best bet is to target a very specific demographic.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.600
In this case, conservatives with a conspiratorial streak

28:26.600 --> 28:28.640
validate them by telling them that they're right

28:28.640 --> 28:29.680
and then going, hey,

28:29.680 --> 28:31.640
if you want to become even more powerful,

28:31.640 --> 28:33.000
check out our pills.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.280
Also get all you need to completely stuff

28:35.280 --> 28:36.520
Christmas stockings this year

28:36.560 --> 28:38.560
with our Christmas Mega Pack.

28:38.560 --> 28:42.240
So it starts with, don't say Merry Christmas,

28:42.240 --> 28:43.360
and it ends with,

28:43.360 --> 28:46.280
they create an orthodox centralized system as well

28:46.280 --> 28:50.120
that is gonna be welded in to the new fascist left west

28:50.120 --> 28:51.200
and out of that marriage,

28:51.200 --> 28:54.720
you will have the communist socialist system

28:54.720 --> 28:56.520
of Islam merged with that.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.480
I mean, this sentence doesn't make sense.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.320
It just doesn't.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.960
It's a list of keywords

29:00.960 --> 29:02.800
but just making fun of how dumb this all is

29:02.800 --> 29:06.120
would be to ignore why he still does it and why it works.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.680
On topics like this, I find myself constantly coming back

29:08.680 --> 29:10.560
to a great paper by Cormac Hurley,

29:10.560 --> 29:12.200
a principal researcher at Microsoft,

29:12.200 --> 29:14.800
about Nigerian email scams and how they function.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.080
You know how the Nigerian email scams

29:17.080 --> 29:19.680
usually have very poor language usage and grammar

29:19.680 --> 29:21.640
and even say they're from Nigeria

29:21.640 --> 29:23.560
even though if you Google Nigeria,

29:23.560 --> 29:25.800
one of the first results is email scam

29:25.800 --> 29:28.400
and that makes them an obvious scam to most people?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.760
This is actually part of how the scam works

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
because their targets are the sort of people

29:32.760 --> 29:34.640
who won't notice the writing problems

29:34.640 --> 29:36.480
because they tend to be the sort of people

29:36.480 --> 29:37.960
who end up giving them money.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.160
If you're smart enough to not fall for that part,

29:40.160 --> 29:42.040
they don't want you wasting their time

29:42.040 --> 29:45.000
and they've quite smartly selected you out of the process

29:45.000 --> 29:46.080
by writing poorly.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.520
Since gullibility is unobservable,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.320
the best strategy is to get those

29:50.320 --> 29:52.800
who possess this quality to self-identify.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.280
Infowars is following a similar business practice.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.200
Alex Jones's objective is to make money

29:57.200 --> 29:58.880
to sustain his expensive lifestyle

29:58.880 --> 30:00.400
where he eats watches or something

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400
and to do that, he needs to target an audience

30:02.400 --> 30:05.240
who will be fooled into buying his overpriced stuff.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.680
So by talking absolute nonsense,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.360
yes, Jones is turning away everyone with half a brain,

30:10.360 --> 30:12.800
but people with half a brain generally are quite hard

30:12.800 --> 30:16.000
to sell the world's most expensive protein bars,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.840
ultimate fish oil, and, uh, Ultra 12.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.160
Jones is deliberately laser targeting

30:22.160 --> 30:24.400
the kind of people who would hear a phrase like

30:24.400 --> 30:27.120
the communist socialist system of Islam

30:27.120 --> 30:28.760
and think, wow, that's bad.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.040
That's really bad. That's three bad things I hate.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.960
How do I stop that thing that must be happening

30:32.960 --> 30:35.000
because the man with the nice watch said it was?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.280
Which leaves them open to being sold the idea

30:37.280 --> 30:40.080
that keeping Infowars afloat by buying their stuff

30:40.080 --> 30:42.400
is basically the same as showing you're a hero

30:42.400 --> 30:45.360
fighting back against these very real problems

30:45.360 --> 30:46.720
and for the people who fall for it,

30:46.720 --> 30:49.760
it is a real ego boost which creates a loyal fan base

30:49.760 --> 30:51.160
full of repeat customers.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.400
Nobody finds these videos convincing,

30:53.400 --> 30:56.640
but the people therefore find them reassuring.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.720
What you call weird conspiracy theorists

30:58.720 --> 30:59.800
who need validation,

30:59.800 --> 31:02.480
some people call a marketable demographic,

31:02.480 --> 31:04.240
but to keep this machine going,

31:04.240 --> 31:07.400
Jones has to find increasingly outlandish things to say

31:07.400 --> 31:08.960
to hold these people's attention

31:08.960 --> 31:11.000
and come up with reasons to keep supporting him

31:11.000 --> 31:12.400
and fighting the Infowar,

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
and that means getting more and more ridiculous

31:14.400 --> 31:16.200
as the infinite eternal threat

31:16.200 --> 31:18.600
only gets even more infinitely threatening.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.240
Not only does this dance get increasingly difficult,

31:21.240 --> 31:23.800
they've also discovered that you can't just say lies

31:23.800 --> 31:25.240
about people, it turns out.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.800
If they say ridiculous bullshit about real people,

31:27.800 --> 31:30.480
they risk being sued for libel or defamation

31:30.480 --> 31:32.680
as is the case with the Sandy Hook parents

31:32.680 --> 31:35.080
who are in the process of fucking destroying

31:35.080 --> 31:37.800
Jones in court for telling his sizable audience

31:37.800 --> 31:40.160
that the parents of murdered children

31:40.160 --> 31:42.920
are all just paid actors and it was a fake shooting,

31:42.920 --> 31:45.440
so the war on Christmas is a real boon for Jones

31:45.440 --> 31:47.000
because he can just go hog wild

31:47.000 --> 31:48.360
about whatever comes into his head,

31:48.360 --> 31:49.560
just make up whatever,

31:49.560 --> 31:50.880
and occasionally cut to footage

31:50.880 --> 31:52.240
of a tree being pushed over

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
or some random act of vandalism

31:54.240 --> 31:55.720
and explain how they're all connected

31:55.720 --> 31:57.320
by a web of destruction

31:57.320 --> 32:00.920
by the secret Muslim communist anti-family coalition

32:00.920 --> 32:02.360
and it's so incomprehensible

32:02.360 --> 32:04.680
it can't even be considered defamation of anyone.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.600
This is the kind of nonsense safe zone

32:06.600 --> 32:09.240
Infowars has to live in to avoid destroying itself

32:09.240 --> 32:11.680
by getting owned in court which is why,

32:11.680 --> 32:13.320
for legal reasons,

32:13.320 --> 32:15.440
I'm required to mention that story I told earlier

32:15.440 --> 32:17.600
about Paul Joseph Watson is not true.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.800
I made it up. Those DMs are fake.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.480
I thought it would be a funny joke to show how shitty it is

32:22.480 --> 32:23.880
to make things up about people.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.040
However, even though I made it up,

32:26.040 --> 32:27.320
it definitely did happen.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.080
The war on Christmas is a safe bet for Jones to cover

32:30.080 --> 32:32.560
since there's no obvious tangible negative effect

32:32.560 --> 32:34.560
on real people except his audience

32:34.560 --> 32:36.400
whose minds he is completely ruining

32:36.400 --> 32:37.480
but that's their choice.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.240
As what some French people might call

32:39.240 --> 32:42.040
a connoisseur of Infowars garbage,

32:42.040 --> 32:44.320
so I guess it's me whose life they're ruining,

32:44.320 --> 32:47.120
this is my favorite kind of the schlock they do

32:47.120 --> 32:48.680
where Alex just grabs a cameraman

32:48.680 --> 32:51.480
and goes out in public and just makes a bunch of noise

32:51.480 --> 32:53.480
and runs around annoying people

32:53.480 --> 32:55.280
and getting to arguments with whoever he can get

32:55.280 --> 32:57.520
his soy-stained hands on.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.680
Sometimes he forgets that trying to cite data

32:59.680 --> 33:01.280
opens him up to being punked

33:01.280 --> 33:02.840
and accidentally offers statistics

33:02.840 --> 33:05.440
that can be easily rebuked with simple explanations

33:05.440 --> 33:06.560
and then they have to leave it in

33:06.560 --> 33:08.760
because that's the best footage they got that night.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.400
There is a war on Christmas.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.560
There is a war on Christianity.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.440
Did you know that more than half

33:13.440 --> 33:14.760
of all religious persecution in the world

33:14.760 --> 33:16.040
is against Christians?

33:16.040 --> 33:19.000
I believe it. I mean, we're one of the largest groups.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.960
Oh. So statistically,

33:20.960 --> 33:22.520
if there's attack on a region,

33:22.520 --> 33:24.520
there's gonna be a lot of attack on Christians.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.520
Uh...

33:25.520 --> 33:27.520
♪ Somebody wants to kill... ♪

33:27.520 --> 33:29.880
Once that kid politely shakes his hand and leaves,

33:29.880 --> 33:31.240
Jones starts losing it,

33:31.240 --> 33:33.800
just screaming Merry Christmas into the void,

33:33.800 --> 33:36.440
talking about how free he is from control.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.720
Merry Christmas!

33:38.720 --> 33:40.520
We're not surrendering, ladies and gentlemen.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.280
America and the world is awake.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.520
Freedom is rising,

33:43.520 --> 33:45.520
and Merry Christmas from Infowars.com.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.720
But then he remembers that the point of all this

33:48.720 --> 33:49.920
is to push his products,

33:49.920 --> 33:51.160
so then there's another few minutes

33:51.160 --> 33:53.480
where he calms down and talks about the great deals

33:53.480 --> 33:55.960
you can get at InfowarsStore.com.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.160
There's a war on Christmas.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.280
There's a war on America.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.880
There's a war on our free speech.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.880
There's a war on the family's very existence.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.440
And those very same forces that have it out for Christianity

34:06.440 --> 34:07.720
have it out for Infowars

34:07.720 --> 34:09.960
and have it out for you and your family.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.160
But we need you to go to InfowarsStore.com

34:12.160 --> 34:12.880
this Christmas.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.240
We need you to fund Infowars

34:14.240 --> 34:15.440
by getting great products you need.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.200
We've got huge sales going right now.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.320
And this completes the selection process.

34:19.320 --> 34:22.200
After spending 15 minutes literally just running around

34:22.200 --> 34:23.680
and screaming at people,

34:23.680 --> 34:26.320
anyone still watching is probably a prime target

34:26.320 --> 34:27.360
for his advertising.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.400
So you get three whole minutes of him explaining to you

34:30.400 --> 34:32.200
how cheap the deals are.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.400
Everything's still more expensive than the equivalent

34:34.400 --> 34:36.200
you can find at, like, any other store.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.120
But that's not the point.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.680
The point is you're supporting the Info War.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.240
You're saving the world with free speech

34:42.240 --> 34:45.320
and fight bad men.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.520
I'm so glad I can fight back against control

34:48.480 --> 34:50.480
by purchasing iodine.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.440
So we find here that the War on Christmas

34:52.440 --> 34:54.720
is a decent way of getting very gullible people

34:54.720 --> 34:56.000
to pay attention long enough

34:56.000 --> 34:58.360
that you can direct sell them diet supplements.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.360
And we've seen how for people whose business model

35:00.360 --> 35:02.440
involves straying close to legal action,

35:02.440 --> 35:05.120
something ridiculous and silly like the War on Christmas

35:05.120 --> 35:06.400
is kinda a gimme.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.840
You can accuse the bad people coalition

35:08.840 --> 35:11.800
of secret Christmas crimes and you're safe

35:11.800 --> 35:14.880
because imaginary people you made up can't sue you.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.960
However, we still haven't fully discovered

35:16.960 --> 35:19.720
why the War on Christmas specifically has

35:19.720 --> 35:22.360
such a strong appeal to the kinds of sad people

35:22.360 --> 35:24.480
who make up Info War's customer base

35:24.480 --> 35:26.880
or why conservatives see such an appeal

35:26.880 --> 35:29.680
in believing Christmas is under attack in the first place.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.760
So to find out more, I, uh, got bored

35:32.760 --> 35:35.320
and decided to invent a new recipe for eggnog.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.720
Well, there you have it.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.480
The War on Christmas is over.

35:38.480 --> 35:41.400
And I guess Christmas won because it turned out

35:41.400 --> 35:44.840
that there never was a war on it.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.680
Oh, well. I think eggs go bad pretty quick, don't they?

35:47.680 --> 35:49.840
♪♪

35:49.840 --> 35:53.600
Oh, my tummy and brain.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.560
I microwaved this earlier to warm it up

35:55.560 --> 35:57.880
and now there's definitely bits of paint loose in it.

35:57.880 --> 35:58.880
Thanks, Neil.

35:58.880 --> 36:02.320
Oh, I think I'm cross-faded on paint fumes and alcohol.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.120
Oh, no, it's happening.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.640
I've lost enough IQ points that I think IQ is real

36:07.640 --> 36:09.160
and that means I'm fucked up enough

36:09.160 --> 36:10.960
to watch a PragerU video.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.480
PragerU is a YouTube channel funded by oil

36:13.480 --> 36:15.880
and fracking barons and other related think tanks

36:15.880 --> 36:17.920
which likes to masquerade as a university.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.320
Honestly, you don't even need to look up the topics they cover.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.160
If you find a list of their major donors,

36:22.160 --> 36:24.000
you can pretty easily guess the entirety

36:24.000 --> 36:25.120
of their video output.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.600
They make five-minute long videos

36:26.600 --> 36:28.960
which feature next to no research or evidence

36:28.960 --> 36:31.280
but they have a lot of money to spend on infographics

36:31.280 --> 36:33.400
and getting special guests to read their scripts

36:33.400 --> 36:35.960
and that's basically the same thing as being true.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.080
This one on the War on Christmas is called

36:38.080 --> 36:39.840
Just Say Merry Christmas.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.640
This is the usual stuff we've seen before

36:41.640 --> 36:43.080
but presented in a new way.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.720
I mean, literally, it's just a repurposed Bill O'Reilly script

36:45.720 --> 36:48.440
complete with an aside about how it's the secularists' fault.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.040
The opponents of Merry Christmas

36:50.040 --> 36:51.960
and other uses of the word Christmas

36:51.960 --> 36:53.680
know exactly what they're doing.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.480
The opponents of Christmas? What the fuck?

36:56.480 --> 36:58.920
They're disingenuous when they dismiss defenders

36:58.920 --> 37:01.840
of Merry Christmas as fabricating some,

37:01.840 --> 37:04.240
quote, war on Christmas.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.000
Of course it's a war on Christmas

37:07.000 --> 37:08.800
or more precisely,

37:08.800 --> 37:11.520
a war on the religious nature of America.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.280
When I first watched this video,

37:13.280 --> 37:15.000
this image kept coming back to me

37:15.000 --> 37:16.920
of a person who says happy holidays

37:16.920 --> 37:19.920
and laughs at people who think the war on Christmas is real

37:19.920 --> 37:22.360
morphing into an enemy combatant.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.480
Why was this imagery necessary?

37:24.480 --> 37:26.240
Why take people laughing at you

37:26.240 --> 37:28.040
for believing a made-up thing,

37:28.040 --> 37:31.080
accuse them of knowing exactly what they're doing,

37:31.080 --> 37:32.760
and then reveal them to be trying

37:32.760 --> 37:35.360
to destroy America's nature?

37:35.360 --> 37:38.960
And then I realized that this is the actual core

37:38.960 --> 37:40.040
of the whole thing.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.920
This image actually explains

37:41.920 --> 37:43.880
more about the conservative ideology

37:43.880 --> 37:45.600
than anything else we've covered here.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.400
You see, Dennis Prager and ideologues like him

37:48.400 --> 37:50.280
have for quite a while been encountering

37:50.280 --> 37:52.080
this one small problem,

37:52.080 --> 37:54.040
which is that their ideas are wrong.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.800
This is why, if you watch any of PragerU's other videos,

37:56.800 --> 37:58.680
they're full of completely hysterical,

37:58.680 --> 38:00.000
imaginary graphs,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.040
most of which don't even label their axes.

38:02.040 --> 38:02.880
What even is this?

38:02.880 --> 38:05.280
And often they make outright false claims

38:05.280 --> 38:06.720
and tell clear lies.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.880
Sometimes they fabricate ridiculous quotes

38:08.880 --> 38:10.760
and put quotations around them as if to say,

38:10.760 --> 38:12.120
look at this ridiculous thing

38:12.120 --> 38:14.080
people who disagree with you say,

38:14.080 --> 38:16.320
but the quote is something they made up.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.880
No one actually said this.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.760
They made it up and attributed it to some imaginary enemy

38:20.760 --> 38:23.080
to try to convince you that this is what people

38:23.080 --> 38:25.760
who aren't like you believe, so you must be right.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.400
This constant lying and misrepresentation of reality

38:29.400 --> 38:31.120
makes my point for me.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.720
To get you to believe what they believe,

38:33.720 --> 38:37.600
they have to lie because the truth simply isn't enough

38:37.640 --> 38:38.960
to support these beliefs.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.160
The bulk of PragerU consists of strategies

38:41.160 --> 38:43.920
to get around the fact they don't have a leg to stand on

38:43.920 --> 38:45.200
when it comes to the truth,

38:45.200 --> 38:47.400
and this is where the war on Christmas

38:47.400 --> 38:50.120
and similar conspiracy theories comes in

38:50.120 --> 38:52.720
because when a belief system is on shaky ground

38:52.720 --> 38:53.960
when it comes to the truth,

38:53.960 --> 38:56.240
it needs something else to maintain it,

38:56.240 --> 38:59.240
extra beliefs and fantasies to prop it all up.

38:59.240 --> 39:03.320
Otherwise, doubts and anxieties start to come in.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.760
What if I'm wrong?

39:04.760 --> 39:06.800
What if I've missed something?

39:06.800 --> 39:09.120
What if other people are laughing at me?

39:09.120 --> 39:11.760
What better way to put a stop to these feelings

39:11.760 --> 39:13.600
than to convince yourself your enemies

39:13.600 --> 39:15.840
are trying to destroy your culture,

39:15.840 --> 39:17.520
even your holidays,

39:17.520 --> 39:19.880
that they're even doing it on purpose

39:19.880 --> 39:21.520
and know they're doing it

39:21.520 --> 39:24.440
because they're the bad guys and you're the good guys?

39:24.440 --> 39:27.000
Instantly, all your doubts and fears

39:27.000 --> 39:28.440
that you've missed something,

39:28.440 --> 39:31.440
all critical thinking can be dismissed.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.360
Life stops being about reason or evidence

39:34.360 --> 39:36.200
and starts being about the war

39:36.200 --> 39:39.080
to protect your ways from the bad ways.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.600
Right and wrong don't matter anymore.

39:41.600 --> 39:45.600
They are conspiring to destroy you.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.840
When you don't say Merry Christmas,

39:47.840 --> 39:50.600
you're stealing my holiday from me.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.040
They even have a little animation

39:52.040 --> 39:54.280
where a kid beats up Santa Claus.

39:54.280 --> 39:57.080
This is how persecuted the far right

39:57.080 --> 39:59.120
need to convince themselves they are

39:59.120 --> 40:01.680
to escape from the much simpler conclusion

40:01.680 --> 40:04.680
that some of the things they believe aren't true.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.000
Everyone has to be out to get them.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.760
Even by saying Happy Holidays,

40:08.760 --> 40:10.920
you're kicking the shit out of their dreams.

40:10.920 --> 40:14.000
Imagine something you enjoy, something you love.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.440
The bad guys hate it.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.880
They'll call it racist and patriarchal

40:17.880 --> 40:19.160
and try to destroy it.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.880
You're smart. You think good things.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.920
Their ideas are weird and strange.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.440
It's okay. It's okay.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.800
You can go back to sleep.

40:28.800 --> 40:35.240
♪♪

40:35.240 --> 40:36.680
You don't have to think too hard

40:36.680 --> 40:38.480
about the fine details of your beliefs

40:38.480 --> 40:40.760
if you also think people are out to get you

40:40.760 --> 40:41.760
for believing them.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.760
You don't have to think about

40:42.760 --> 40:44.960
why the evidence or data contradicts you.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.440
The bad guys are out to destroy your culture,

40:47.440 --> 40:49.200
so they probably made it all up.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.400
It's like we're so busy in America

40:51.400 --> 40:52.800
trying to promote tolerance,

40:52.800 --> 40:56.280
but this tolerance is intolerating everything

40:56.280 --> 40:57.800
except Christianity.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.200
You look at Christians as narrow-minded bigots,

41:00.200 --> 41:01.880
but the opposite is actually true.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.760
Christianity is being bigoted against.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.840
We're under attack.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.880
If you're against my intolerance of others,

41:07.880 --> 41:09.560
you're attacking me.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.080
Conservative Christians must be the real victims

41:12.080 --> 41:13.600
of bigotry in the world.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.880
I'm not wrong.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.440
There's just a war against my beliefs.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.520
How convenient.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.560
And it's once again the person of the Lord Jesus Christ

41:21.560 --> 41:23.480
that is under attack, but the Bible says,

41:23.480 --> 41:26.280
no weapon formed against us shall be able to prosper.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.400
So we're gonna be all right.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.920
Tell that to Constantinople, baby!

Prager ends his video by summing up

41:33.880 --> 41:35.560
his victim complex for me.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.520
By not wishing me a Merry Christmas,

41:37.520 --> 41:40.000
you are not being inclusive.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.160
You are excluding me

41:42.160 --> 41:45.120
from one of my nation's national holidays.

41:45.120 --> 41:48.680
So please, say Merry Christmas

41:48.680 --> 41:50.680
and Christmas party

41:50.680 --> 41:53.080
and Christmas vacation.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.040
If you don't, you're not inclusive.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.200
You're hurtful.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.960
Private military contractors,

42:00.960 --> 42:04.560
on the other hand, are fine!

42:04.560 --> 42:06.040
What the fuck?!

42:06.040 --> 42:08.280
Ah, what a delightfully unbiased video.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.880
No political agenda here.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.480
This course was made possible by a generous donation

42:12.480 --> 42:15.120
from Reagan.com!

42:15.120 --> 42:17.520
A great example of how this imaginary sense

42:17.520 --> 42:19.760
of victimhood excuses flaws in the rest

42:19.760 --> 42:22.240
of the belief system is present in this video.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.160
Prager briefly sums up what he calls

42:24.160 --> 42:26.200
the inclusiveness argument.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.760
Let's see how he summarizes it.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.040
That Merry Christmas or Christmas party

42:30.040 --> 42:33.520
or Christmas vacation is not inclusive.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.960
Now, what he's saying kind of makes sense here, doesn't it?

42:35.960 --> 42:38.840
If there's going to be an event during the holiday season

42:38.840 --> 42:41.400
that's traditionally called a Christmas party

42:41.400 --> 42:43.480
but some people who don't celebrate Christmas

42:43.480 --> 42:45.080
might also be invited to it,

42:45.080 --> 42:48.400
some people might argue that calling it a holiday party

42:48.400 --> 42:51.160
is a more appropriate name than a Christmas party.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.600
Now, personally, I don't think it really matters

42:53.600 --> 42:56.080
what you call a party and I also don't really think

42:56.080 --> 42:58.840
many non-Christians will decide not to go to an event

42:58.840 --> 43:01.120
simply because it's called a Christmas event

43:01.120 --> 43:05.120
but I do see the overall point of the inclusiveness argument.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.560
It is maybe a little more appropriate a name

43:07.560 --> 43:09.760
for a gathering of people and I don't really think

43:09.760 --> 43:11.960
there's anything wrong with naming something like that

43:11.960 --> 43:13.800
in the hopes it makes some people feel

43:13.800 --> 43:15.440
more recognized and included.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.600
It's just not a big deal.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.720
The argument seems fairly decent to me.

43:18.720 --> 43:21.600
So what is Dennis' rebuttal to this argument?

43:21.600 --> 43:24.400
Well, his problem is he doesn't really have one.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.920
He simply asks who is really being excluded

43:26.920 --> 43:29.560
and uses this to segue into an actually unrelated

43:29.560 --> 43:31.480
final point which we'll get to later

43:31.480 --> 43:33.840
but his actual rebuttal is provided

43:33.840 --> 43:35.600
in how he presents this argument

43:35.600 --> 43:38.200
which is that this entire argument is just a trick

43:38.200 --> 43:40.000
you shouldn't listen to at all.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.840
Let's look at how he sets up the inclusiveness argument

43:42.840 --> 43:43.800
in the video.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.200
Activists on the left will eventually seek

43:46.200 --> 43:50.200
to remove Christmas as a national holiday.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.560
Now, the left doesn't announce that its agenda

43:52.560 --> 43:56.480
is to thoroughly secularize American and European societies.

43:56.480 --> 44:00.240
Instead, they offer the inclusiveness argument.

44:00.240 --> 44:03.600
The leftist secularists, an all-powerful cult,

44:03.600 --> 44:06.160
are trying to change the nature of America

44:06.160 --> 44:08.760
but they can't just walk around all day saying,

44:08.760 --> 44:11.240
I'm evil and want to destroy Christmas

44:11.240 --> 44:13.760
so they came up with this argument instead

44:13.760 --> 44:16.760
but it's not their real reason so you should ignore it.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.160
The argument might sound reasonable

44:19.160 --> 44:20.840
but you shouldn't think about it

44:20.840 --> 44:23.560
because they're bad and have an evil agenda.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.680
This masks the actual truth

44:26.680 --> 44:28.480
which is that the inclusiveness argument

44:28.480 --> 44:30.120
is actually fairly cogent.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.960
Dennis can't give a rebuttal to that

44:32.960 --> 44:35.800
because it's a really simple, small point

44:35.800 --> 44:37.320
that just makes sense

44:37.320 --> 44:39.720
but admitting that means conceding

44:39.720 --> 44:42.680
that sometimes it's nice to make people feel included

44:42.680 --> 44:46.080
which destroys the entire war on Christmas argument

44:46.080 --> 44:50.000
so instead, he reframes the argument as a fake trick

44:50.000 --> 44:53.800
by a group of people who want to remove religion from society

44:53.800 --> 44:56.880
who are only pretending to want people to feel included

44:56.880 --> 44:59.360
and this is how persecution complexes function

44:59.360 --> 45:01.400
in making people retain their ideas.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.280
If you make a decent enough argument

45:03.280 --> 45:05.080
that they can't give a rebuttal to,

45:05.080 --> 45:07.720
they can just fantasize about how it's a trick.

45:07.720 --> 45:09.400
This inclusive argument plays

45:09.400 --> 45:12.480
on Americans' highly developed sense of decency.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.800
They're just trying to play on your sense of decency

45:15.800 --> 45:19.680
as opposed to expecting you to do a really basic decent thing.

45:19.680 --> 45:22.040
It's all part of the secret secularist plot

45:22.040 --> 45:25.320
by the secularists to bring about their state religion,

45:25.320 --> 45:26.560
secularism.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.160
Most people do not realize

45:28.160 --> 45:30.680
that the left believes in secularism

45:30.680 --> 45:33.880
as fervently as religious Jews and Christians

45:33.880 --> 45:35.080
believe in the Bible.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.360
I'm sorry, what?

45:38.360 --> 45:42.280
That doesn't make any fucking sense, Dennis!

45:42.280 --> 45:43.600
What does that mean?

45:43.600 --> 45:46.080
Who the fuck do secularists pray to?

45:46.080 --> 45:47.720
Fucking Aquaman?

45:47.720 --> 45:48.840
I did it. I did the joke.

45:48.840 --> 45:49.920
I did the thing again.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.120

♪♪

45:57.240 --> 45:58.680
So there we have it.

45:58.680 --> 46:01.520
I think we figured out the purpose of the war on Christmas.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.520
Sometimes it's to grab people's attention

46:03.520 --> 46:05.400
either to sell advertising space

46:05.400 --> 46:08.920
or to directly sell supplements, soy pills, and buttons,

46:08.920 --> 46:11.720
but on a deeper level, it's a fantasy of victimhood

46:11.720 --> 46:14.040
that helps to support an underlying belief system

46:14.040 --> 46:16.480
that doesn't have facts to support it otherwise.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.760
You're not wrong.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.880
They're just out to get you.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.040
Who's they?

46:21.040 --> 46:23.160
It's whoever you want it to be.

46:23.160 --> 46:25.680
Oh, and here's one last quick incidental thing

46:25.680 --> 46:27.520
that happens to tie all of this together.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.120
Prager's old war on Christmas video

46:29.120 --> 46:31.200
fills time by talking about how a Jewish person

46:31.200 --> 46:32.600
wrote White Christmas.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.040
That's why it's not surprising

46:34.040 --> 46:36.560
that it was an American Jew, Irving Berlin,

46:36.560 --> 46:38.240
who wrote White Christmas,

46:38.240 --> 46:41.120
one of America's most popular Christmas songs.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.200
In fact, according to a Jewish musician

46:43.200 --> 46:45.360
writing in the New York Times,

46:45.360 --> 46:48.360
almost all the most popular Christmas songs

46:48.360 --> 46:50.400
were written by Jews.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.320
Apparently, all these American Jews

46:52.320 --> 46:55.640
felt quite included by Christmas.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.040
So there we go.

46:57.040 --> 47:00.400
Non-Christians will never feel excluded by Christmas

47:00.400 --> 47:01.840
because 70 years ago,

47:01.840 --> 47:05.040
a Jewish person wrote a song with Christmas in it.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.640
Dennis thinks this is a great point,

47:07.640 --> 47:09.080
and you can tell he thinks it's great

47:09.080 --> 47:10.480
because he wrote it into the script

47:10.480 --> 47:13.040
for this year's video about Christmas as well.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.400
And in perfect melting pot fashion,

47:15.400 --> 47:18.080
Irving Berlin, the son of a rabbi,

47:18.080 --> 47:20.120
wrote the definitive Yuletide song,

47:20.120 --> 47:21.160
White Christmas.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.360
Ah, it's such a clever point.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.080
You might as well use it twice.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.600
Unfortunately for Dennis,

47:25.600 --> 47:27.160
Irving Berlin didn't just write

47:27.160 --> 47:29.280
exactly one song about Christmas

47:29.280 --> 47:31.000
then disappear into the void.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.160
He actually lived on and wrote a few songs

47:33.160 --> 47:35.280
that might even be a bit inconvenient

47:35.280 --> 47:36.680
for Dennis' argument.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.560
He also composed a little ditty

47:38.600 --> 47:40.760
called Happy Holiday.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.080
That's right. The same guy behind White Christmas

47:43.080 --> 47:46.320
also wrote the other incredibly iconic Christmas song,

47:46.320 --> 47:47.760
the one that opened and closed

47:47.760 --> 47:50.400
Bing Crosby's big Christmas show for many years.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.920
Apparently, Irving Berlin wrote

47:51.920 --> 47:53.720
Happy Holidays into his lyrics

47:53.720 --> 47:56.360
because that's a completely normal thing to say,

47:56.360 --> 47:58.400
and the use of the phrase has nothing to do

47:58.400 --> 48:00.040
with political correctness.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.000
Incidentally, White Christmas was composed

48:02.000 --> 48:03.560
for a film called Holiday Inn,

48:03.560 --> 48:05.800
which also has Happy Holiday on the soundtrack.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.880
This fact isn't particularly meaningful here,

48:07.920 --> 48:09.040
but I thought it was funny.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.440
Dennis Prager obviously knows all this.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.080
If he knows about Irving Berlin,

48:13.080 --> 48:15.360
he surely knows his other popular songs

48:15.360 --> 48:16.360
and their titles.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.520
He's not stupid.

48:17.520 --> 48:20.560
He knows it's normal to say Happy Holidays at Christmas.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.040
It's impossible to miss this fact

48:22.040 --> 48:23.760
even if you do basic research.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.240
Hell, even one of the articles he cites in the video

48:26.240 --> 48:28.840
mentions that White Christmas was written for Holiday Inn,

48:28.840 --> 48:31.480
but for his videos, he performatively pretends

48:31.480 --> 48:33.680
these facts don't exist because PragerU

48:33.680 --> 48:35.720
is a fake university designed to sell

48:35.720 --> 48:38.560
a broken belief system so its donors can continue

48:38.560 --> 48:40.360
to profit from the status quo,

48:40.360 --> 48:41.440
and at the end of the day,

48:41.440 --> 48:44.080
isn't that what Christmas is all about?

48:44.080 --> 48:46.480
No. Well, it shouldn't be, but it is.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.680
Wow, with motion graphics,

48:47.680 --> 48:49.240
you can strawman people easily.

48:49.240 --> 48:51.360
Great idea, Dennis, but what are you gonna do

48:51.360 --> 48:53.280
if other people start doing it to you?

48:53.280 --> 48:54.280
Oh, his mouth fell off.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.240
Merry Christmas, everyone.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.720
See? I can say it,

48:57.720 --> 49:00.160
and I'm king of the male feminists,

49:00.160 --> 49:02.080
so clearly there's no problem here.

49:02.080 --> 49:04.440
Other people do have holidays around now though,

49:04.480 --> 49:07.000
so happy holidays might be more appropriate

49:07.000 --> 49:08.680
in some circumstances.

49:08.680 --> 49:11.120
Anyway, if you're angry

49:11.120 --> 49:15.440
and you need a reason to be angry to do with Christmas,

49:15.440 --> 49:16.600
go to therapy.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.200
Just go to therapy.

49:18.200 --> 49:20.960
If you're angry and you think it's because lesbians

49:20.960 --> 49:22.560
are in a Christmas thing,

49:22.560 --> 49:24.040
you're not actually angry

49:24.040 --> 49:26.000
because people are corrupting Christmas

49:26.000 --> 49:29.040
or infecting your traditions and culture.

49:29.040 --> 49:29.880
You're not even angry

49:29.880 --> 49:32.240
because of political correctness or leftism.

49:32.280 --> 49:34.560
You're angry because you feel expected to be,

49:34.560 --> 49:37.400
because you've built a cage for your mind,

49:37.400 --> 49:38.840
and the solution to that

49:38.840 --> 49:40.880
is to change things about yourself.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.880
Sorry, there isn't anything wrong

49:42.880 --> 49:44.960
that needs to be fixed with the world.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.920
about the graph that I made for this video,

51:42.920 --> 51:44.560
