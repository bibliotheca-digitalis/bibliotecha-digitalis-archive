0	15480	Oh, I'm definitely not going to get this video finished on time.
15480	19520	Happy holidays, friends, enemies, frenemies and splenemies.
19520	45440	Paris Bomberguy here, and I'll see you in the next video.
45440	47140	Okay, right, I can explain.
47140	49040	I recorded the Halloween segment of that video
49040	51280	as a funny joke about how it takes me a while
51280	55400	to make videos, and then I actually missed last Christmas.
55400	57520	So here we are in the apocalypse.
57520	61760	Let's all watch last year's Christmas video.
61760	63740	This year, now that it's done,
63740	67640	this means I technically got a seasonal video out on time,
67640	69400	which means I'm good at my job.
69400	70740	Fuck you.
70740	73240	I'm just chilling out here in my house,
73240	76180	enjoying the best that the clearance aisle had to offer.
76180	80080	This Fortnite Funko Pop Tower Recon Specialist.
80080	83080	Okay, this tasteful Coraline mug
83080	85000	you can drink out of Coraline's head.
85000	87800	Start off your morning routine with Coraline.
87800	90440	Uh, not dishwasher or microwave safe.
90440	93440	And this friend's makeup set where every color
93440	96440	is a reference to a show that ended 15 years ago.
96440	98120	Fukuyama was right.
98120	101800	History ended in 2004 when Rachel got off the plane.
101800	104200	And yes, I'm actually going to give this as a gift
104200	106560	at my family's secret Santa this year.
106560	109280	I guess you know who got you your gift, Luke.
109280	110800	I hope you've seen friends.
110800	113400	I also hope you'll stop being such a Ross.
113400	115160	Ah, but the sad thing is,
115160	116760	when I give my family these gifts,
116760	119160	which are as good as they deserve, on Christmas Day,
119160	122720	I won't even be allowed to say Merry Christmas as I do it
122720	127040	because of the liberal, communist, atheist conspiracy
127040	130600	to destroy the Christian religion by eroding its traditions.
130600	133160	Political correctness, whoever that is,
133160	137640	literally says it's racist to say Christmas now.
137640	140000	At least that's what I reckon is happening.
140000	141760	And that's the same thing as checking.
141760	144440	Our culture is being crushed underfoot
144440	147760	by radicals who want to destroy polite society
147760	149520	to achieve their own ends.
149520	154400	Oh, those hecking, gosh darned, flipping bastards.
154400	156320	Christianity comes under attack.
156320	157520	There's a war on Christmas.
157520	159880	They outlawed Merry Christmas a few years ago,
159880	160720	and you know it.
160720	164640	Christmas becomes ever more about shallow displays
164640	166280	of political correctness.
166280	168280	Happy holidays, not Merry Christmas.
168280	171400	Kids no longer have Christmas vacation, holiday vacation.
171400	173520	Christmas parties, holiday parties.
173520	175720	The war on Christmas.
175720	176960	Whoever's watching this right now,
176960	178240	think of something you love
178240	180800	that brings you a sense of peace and decency,
180800	183720	and they will somehow link it to the patriarchy
183720	186400	and the rest of their politically correct nonsense.
186400	188280	Christianity is being bigoted against.
188280	189320	We're under attack.
189320	192280	You couldn't even say Merry Christmas at Walmart.
192280	194080	Obama said Merry Christmas a few times,
194080	196320	but he still made sure to neuter the Christmas cards
196320	198760	and also the Christmas decorations at the White House.
198760	201760	What we're seeing happening has been a recent phenomenon,
201760	204760	the war on Christmas, the war against religious liberty.
204760	206680	Of course it's a war on Christmas.
206680	211040	Christmas has lost all meaning thanks to cultural Marxism.
211040	213280	Ah, it's those bloody cultural Marxists
213280	214760	ruining everything again.
214760	216800	That's why society's getting worse.
216800	218920	It can't possibly be because of the policies
218920	220760	of the people who keep getting elected.
220760	223000	But don't worry, peace-loving citizens.
223000	225080	I'm here to lead the charge in fighting back
225080	226960	against these imaginary ghosts,
226960	230160	so grab a slice of anonymous holiday meat
230160	233480	and settle into your festive-season Anderson shelter
233480	236040	before the political correctness bombs hit
236040	238480	because it's time for the war on Christmas.
238480	240920	Ooh, I won.
240920	243280	Ho, ho, ho!
243280	244680	Merry Chri-
244680	245960	Whoa!
246960	248440	In most Western countries,
248440	250840	the winter season plays host to many religious
250840	252120	and cultural traditions.
252120	253520	Some people say the phrase,
253520	255440	happy holidays, exists as a way of trying
255440	257560	to be more inclusive to other people's traditions
257560	259840	in the modern era, but this is inaccurate.
259840	262120	I did literally five minutes of Googling
262120	265800	and found happy holidays being used as far back as 1863,
265800	267480	and who knows how far back further
267480	268720	it would have turned out to have gone
268720	270880	if I'd done any more research.
270880	273000	It turns out that people like to have
273000	275200	more than one phrase to say.
275240	277920	It's why people put season's greetings on stuff.
277920	280360	This isn't blasphemy. It's language.
280360	282000	Did you know we've been writing X-mas
282000	284000	instead of Christmas for thousands of years?
284000	286360	The X isn't trying to secularize the religion
286360	288360	by removing the word Christ or something.
288360	290440	It's actually the Greek letter chi,
290440	291640	which has been a Christogram,
291640	293320	an abbreviation of Jesus Christ,
293320	295880	for about 1,700 years or something.
295880	299120	I don't know. I'm not a religion...studier.
299120	300960	An extremely popular song from 19-
300960	302360	Theologian. That was the word.
302400	305400	A very popular song from as far back as 1942
305400	306560	was Happy Holiday.
306560	308000	You might know this song or at least one
308000	309720	of its 65 million covers.
309720	311520	It was originally sung by Bing Crosby
311520	314000	who was, by all accounts, a pretty devoted Catholic.
314000	316560	Bing was one of the faces of Christmas for decades.
316560	319360	His Christmas radio broadcasts were hugely popular.
319360	321800	That song was the opening and closing theme
321800	323880	of his Christmas Sing with Bing program
323880	326640	which aired every Christmas Eve for almost 10 years.
326640	329400	So sure, happy holidays is a useful catch-all term
329400	331800	since there are a lot of holidays going on.
331800	333760	Makes sense to use it in some contexts,
333760	336080	but saying it isn't actually a new phenomenon.
336080	338000	It's been a normal thing for Christians
338000	340360	to say to each other for many years,
340360	342560	and that piece of knowledge is one of the finest gifts
342560	343800	I can bring.
343800	347080	Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.
347080	348160	Peace on Earth!
348160	350360	These are all indisputable and quite interesting
350360	351760	historical facts,
351760	355040	but not everyone puts the truth on their Christmas list.
355040	356840	Some people want to open their stockings
356840	359800	and find an explanation for why they're angry all the time.
359800	362240	The big originator of the War on Christmas theory
362240	363400	is Bill O'Reilly.
363400	365240	I couldn't find footage of Bill's original
365240	366480	War on Christmas segment,
366480	368440	but handily, the script Bill reads from
368440	370360	in these segments was posted as an article
370360	371360	on Fox's website.
371360	374240	The segment was titled Christmas Under Siege
374240	375920	in which he made exaggerated claims
375920	377520	about how various holiday parades
377520	379360	were doing away with Christmas floats,
379360	382280	New York has a holiday tree instead of a Christmas tree,
382280	384520	and how Macy's stopped greeting people
384520	385840	with Merry Christmas.
385840	387560	They said a different thing!
387560	389320	O'Reilly then went on to fantasize
389320	390480	that this was part of a plot
390480	392680	to diminish people's faith in religion,
392680	393960	saying that, quote-unquote,
393960	396600	secular progressives wanted to destroy
396600	398760	religious oppositions to their policies
398760	402520	such as gay marriage, abortion, and drug legalization,
402520	404960	and to bring about this horrible nightmare future,
404960	408800	it was important to destroy religion in the public arena.
408800	412240	Thus, Christian displays like Christmas must be scaled back
412240	414680	because the connection with Judeo-Christian beliefs
414680	416600	is bad for the secular agenda.
416600	420040	Ah, yes, the famously Judeo-Christian belief
420040	421400	in Christmas.
421400	423960	The secular movement has influence in the media,
423960	426120	among some judges and politicians.
426120	427920	Americans will lose their country
427920	429640	if they don't begin to take action.
429640	432400	Any assault on Judeo-Christian philosophy
432400	433520	should be fought.
433520	435760	Organizations like thomasmoore.org
435760	437760	and the Alliance Defense Fund in Phoenix
437760	440240	are fighting back but need your help.
440240	442920	The USA cannot defeat terrorism
442920	445720	and any other evil without a strong,
445760	448200	traditional foundation that clearly defines
448200	449400	right from wrong.
449400	452320	The struggle today is not about Christmas
452320	454920	but about the spirit of our country.
454920	455960	Ahem.
455960	459800	Bill is writing about how Macy's say a different thing now.
459800	462880	It's basically the conservative version of slam poetry.
462880	466240	Take something that technically has happened
466240	468120	and then contort it until it's an attack
468120	470040	on the very soul of our society
470040	471960	and we need to defend ourselves,
471960	473800	and that's why we need your attention
473840	475760	and the money we'll get from our sponsors
475760	479160	for getting eyes on their peppermint-flavored Play-Doh
479160	481600	or ribbed-for-her-pleasure coffee machines.
481600	483560	Bill's early rhetoric forms the basis
483560	484920	for all the madness to come.
484920	488000	It's always stores not saying Christmas as much,
488000	488920	stuff like that.
488920	490320	Holiday wish list?
490320	491240	Oh, no.
491240	493840	God is dead and we have killed him.
493840	496680	The other side outnumbers them.
496680	499240	I mean, Christian, Judeo, Christian,
499240	500680	people who believe in that philosophy
500680	502400	outnumber the secularists,
502400	504440	maybe six to seven to one.
504440	507320	Oh, my religion has more subscribers than yours.
507320	509200	By the end of his tenure, Bill was straight up
509200	511040	just saying the names of companies
511040	513280	which were trying to slit the throat of Christmas.
513280	517160	Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Foot Locker,
517160	522000	The Gap, The Limited, Nordstrom,
522000	523440	shopping on Amazon.
523440	525400	This year's list was handily provided to Bill
525400	529280	by the American Family Association.
529280	531440	The AFA website is a series of articles
531440	533480	about how only the left does violence
533480	535840	because they've never heard of mass shooting statistics,
535840	539360	LGBT people are the real bullies because, uh,
539360	541760	a woman refused to accept her children were trans
541760	543680	and they stopped wanting to talk to her,
543680	545680	Hallmark and Chick-fil-A are the devil now
545680	547280	because they showed a lesbian wedding
547280	548520	in a commercial or something,
548520	550160	and how VeggieTales is back.
550160	552480	Oh, and also tons of war on Christmas bullshit
552480	554600	verbatim stealing Bill's old schtick.
554600	557800	Three guys you've never heard of discuss the secular push
557800	560880	to scrub away the root word of Christ in Christmas.
561160	563640	There was a war on Christmas we were noticing.
563640	564640	Some people may say,
564640	566560	well, that's not really a big deal, is it?
566560	570520	Well, we thought it was part of the secularist push
570520	574040	to scrub all references to Christianity from our culture.
574040	575720	Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard all this before.
575720	578160	The secularists want to destroy Christianity
578160	581280	and they're doing it by rewording a few things at Christmas
581280	583960	but the AFA, unlike Fox, don't have advertisers.
583960	585400	They survive through donations
585400	587360	and selling things on their website
587360	589240	and you bet they've got a way of capitalizing
589240	590640	on the war on Christmas.
590640	593400	They want you to buy a button that reminds people
593400	595280	that Jesus Christ exists.
595280	597640	Well, it is the Christmas season
597640	601720	and we've got these buttons that we are offering.
601720	603080	Honestly, how can people know
603080	605280	you're a real member of the Jesus fan club
605280	607440	if you aren't repping his holy merch?
607440	611680	You can get your 10-pack of these buttons for $15
611680	614680	and just go to afa.net.
614680	615880	Is it AFA store?
615880	616720	AFA?
616720	617560	Either one.
617560	619800	Afastore.net, afastore.net.
619800	622840	Which brings us to the AFA's yearly naughty or nice list.
622840	625720	One of the most deludedly self-righteous lists
625720	628480	I've ever read and I've read my top 10 games
628480	629560	of the decade list.
629560	633000	Both versions of Dark Souls II are on there out of spite.
633000	633840	Fuck you.
633840	635120	We are not friends.
635120	637120	Click on any naughty company name
637120	639040	for details and contact information.
639040	641040	They want you to send emails to some guy
641040	643200	who works at Office Depot to try to get them
643200	644960	to write Christmas on things more.
644960	647680	If a company has items associated with Christmas
647680	649600	but did not use the word Christmas,
649600	652680	then the company is considered as censoring Christmas.
652680	653800	That's the rubric.
653800	655720	If you sell me a cracker at Christmas
655720	657720	but you don't call it a Christmas cracker,
657720	659360	you're a secularist terrorist
659360	661760	who's trying to stab the Christmas family.
661760	664040	For many years, Bill, with the help of the AFA,
664040	666760	was the reigning champion of the fight to save Christmas.
666760	669920	He was the only man standing up to defend Christian values,
669920	672520	which are the reason he knows right from wrong so well.
672520	674720	But then in 2017, he got fired
674720	676440	for allegedly sexually harassing
676440	678840	at least six of his female co-workers.
678840	681160	So Bill wasn't exactly a great follower
681160	682720	of his religious teachings, was he?
682720	684760	It's very clear why the war on Christmas argument
684760	685960	is so attention-grabbing.
685960	688560	It's telling people that their religion is under attack
688560	690480	and we need those traditional values
690480	693440	or our country will fall to terrorism or other evil.
693440	695040	People will pay attention to your show
695040	696280	when you say things like that,
696280	697840	which leads to increased viewership
697840	700320	and higher value of your advertising spots.
700320	702600	You might even get people to buy a button
702600	704360	or get some wealthy cretins
704360	706600	to donate comical amounts of money to you.
706600	708440	However, I don't think this alone
708440	711040	gets to the true core of why this belief survives
711040	713800	so well in the minds of more extreme conservatives,
713800	715680	so we're gonna have to go deeper,
715680	717000	and then it says in brackets,
717000	718440	Inception Horn Noise.
718440	719840	Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that.
719840	722040	Maybe to understand this line of thinking further,
722040	724920	we need to go in search of even more ridiculously false
724920	727720	and silly versions and see how it functions there.
727720	730440	First, I want to start off with a central theme
730440	733480	which is the war on Christmas.
733480	734480	Oh, hi, Paul.
734480	736720	In this classic video from 2017,
736720	738120	which is a yearly rewatch for me,
738120	740720	it's just a hilarious shambles in so many ways,
740720	743200	Paul Joseph Watson spends 15 minutes
743200	745360	of what's left of his life,
745360	746600	and you only get one life.
746600	749080	This is it, complaining that there's a Tesco commercial
749080	751040	with too much diversity in it.
751040	752320	They called it a Christmas ad,
752320	754080	or at least it was supposed to be that.
754080	756640	Didn't have any symbols of Christianity
756640	758200	in the ad whatsoever.
758200	761840	It did have a gay couple, hijabi Muslims,
761840	763400	all this other goth.
763400	765840	No actual Christian symbol
765840	768120	because, of course, we can't have that anymore, can we?
768120	770480	At least, like, put a vicar in it or something.
770480	772840	A cross. Anything Christian.
772840	774600	It's a Christmas ad for God's sake.
774600	777040	All right, fine, Paul. I'll see what I can do.
777040	780360	Ah, approved for broadcast in InfoWars land.
780360	782920	Wait, Paul also stipulated that a religious figure
782920	784600	would suffice. Okay, how about this?
784600	788440	Hey, guys, that was the College of Cardinals on the phone.
788440	790280	I've just been elected pope.
790280	792080	There, is that religious enough for you?
792080	793120	And if that's not good enough,
793120	795640	I bet I can undo some more catechisms.
795720	797200	Ah, but hang on a second.
797200	798840	It's easy to make fun of Paul.
798840	800240	He's made sure of that,
800240	801920	but let's seriously look at the idea
801920	804200	there is some kind of manipulation happening
804200	805840	with the lack of Christian iconography
805840	808600	in this commercial because this begs a deeper question
808600	810960	which is should Christmas commercials
810960	813000	prominently display Christian stuff
813000	814600	like crosses and priests
814600	816880	because I haven't seen a convincing argument
816880	818880	that the answer to that question is yes
818880	820680	because even in commercials long before
820680	822640	the supposed war on Christmas,
822640	825160	you can still see a seemingly deliberate choice
825160	827840	not to explicitly invoke Christianity
827840	830480	even when the intended audience would be mostly Christian
830480	832680	because it turns out Christians have been having
832680	834960	this exact discussion for a long time now
834960	838000	even before anyone knew what political correctness was.
838000	840640	Historically, plenty of Christians have found
840640	843120	that their religion being tied to a product
843120	846400	being sold to them is kind of crass and disgusting.
846400	848600	There's a Fox & Friends segment from a few years ago
848600	851120	that highlights this discrepancy in an amazing way.
851120	853280	They had a real Catholic priest on
853320	855360	to discuss the war on Christmas
855360	857400	but despite how hard they tried to push him,
857400	860280	he wasn't annoyed that things weren't Christian enough.
860280	863040	You'd be fine if it said Merry Christmas
863040	864680	but it doesn't. It says Happy Holidays
864680	867280	or things are simply red or green.
867280	868880	Well, it's not so much that that bothers me.
868880	870560	It's more that the consumerism
870560	872840	and the pressure to just shop, shop, shop.
872840	875120	He was much more concerned with how consumerism
875120	877760	had eroded the religious meaning of the holiday.
877760	880480	It's more the consumerism I think that's a problem for me.
880480	882120	All right, so let's take a look at some of the stores
882120	884000	that have taken Christmas out of their mottos.
884000	885000	J.Crew.
885000	887040	You can see the Fox people had really planned
887040	888880	for a very different kind of interview.
888880	890960	They'd prepared a graphic all about the mottos
890960	892520	that didn't say Christmas anymore
892520	894560	but not everyone is interested in fabricating
894560	896320	a culture war for attention.
896320	898920	Some people actually want to think about things.
898920	901600	I guess it bothers me that they're using, uh,
901600	904760	sort of, uh, overtly Christian, uh, tropes and themes
904760	906920	like Believe and Merry and things like that
906920	908480	that are associated with Christmas
908480	910000	but they're using it to just market goods.
910000	911000	Now, I don't think it's intentional.
911040	912200	I think it's just a way to appeal
912200	913320	to as many people as possible
913320	915360	but it really kind of denudes, uh,
915360	917560	the holiday of, uh, any sort of religious import.
917560	919720	And it seems that for many devout Christians
919720	921560	the concern isn't that commercials
921560	922920	aren't Christian enough.
922920	924320	It's the exact opposite,
924320	926400	that commercials are leaning a bit too heavily
926400	929720	on Christian ideas and themes in order to sell products.
929720	931800	But the Catholic Church is notoriously full
931800	933080	of commie scumbags.
933080	935760	It just hasn't been the same since the Byzantine Papacy.
935760	936960	You don't have to get it. Don't worry.
936960	938800	Sometimes you write jokes just for you.
938800	941080	Now, I'm not a fancy big time Christian boy
941080	944240	but maybe commercializing the religious aspect
944240	948040	of Christmas in order to sell people things is bad
948040	950480	and the more generic holiday themes in stores
950480	952880	and commercials is a good way of respecting
952880	954680	Christians' religious traditions
954680	957760	and it's been that way since long before 2017.
957760	960360	Paul's whole narrative here is based on the assumption
960360	962880	that commercials loved to invoke Christianity
962880	965080	until Twitter invented social justice
965080	969160	but as we've seen, this assumption is objectively false
969160	972200	and inventing an imaginary past that's been stolen
972200	976120	to justify present foolishness is a real Rachel move.
976120	977520	Regina Phalange.
977520	980240	Facts and data are inconvenient for Paul
980240	981600	so he doesn't like to bring them up
981600	983880	but I saw something interesting that I thought was relevant
983880	985800	so I'm gonna talk about it while I have the chance.
985800	987560	There's a great paper by the National Center
987560	989640	for Social Research which has been gathering data
989640	991200	about how people approach their religion
991200	992640	for about 35 years now
992640	994520	and what they discovered is quite interesting.
994560	997280	In the last 30 years, less and less people identify
997280	999760	as Christian, at least according to the most accurate data.
999760	1001480	This corresponds with an increase in people
1001480	1004360	identifying specifically as unreligious or atheist.
1004360	1006720	Since the 2010s, there's been decisively more
1006720	1009040	non-religious people in Britain than Christians even.
1009040	1011040	Most of these people probably still celebrate
1011040	1011960	Christian traditions.
1011960	1013640	They're a common part of English culture.
1013640	1015800	I'm an atheist and I still celebrate Christmas
1015800	1017800	but all these folks probably aren't putting crosses
1017800	1019280	anywhere in their houses and really,
1019280	1021560	who's to say that that's what Christians do?
1021560	1023920	Not everyone thinks that celebrating their faith
1023920	1025800	requires putting a cross in their house.
1025800	1027520	People's relationships with their religion
1027520	1028520	aren't that simple.
1028520	1030360	There's no Christmas handbook
1030360	1033080	mandating you hang a cross up for the Yuletide.
1033080	1035040	In fact, the actual Christian handbook
1035040	1037480	seems to prioritize worshiping in private
1037480	1040840	unlike those darn pagans who love to babble on and on.
1040840	1042520	What a weird thing to specify.
1042520	1044960	I guess what I'm trying to say is for most people,
1044960	1047160	this commercial is an accurate representation
1047160	1048880	of how people behave at Christmas.
1048880	1051440	It's just not about throwing crosses around, you know?
1051440	1053520	But while we're on the topic of representation,
1053520	1055680	I can't help but notice the specific lack
1055680	1057920	of lightsabers or delicious space milk
1057920	1059440	anywhere in this commercial
1059440	1061480	even though according to census data,
1061480	1064560	almost 1% of Britons self-identify as Jedi.
1064560	1066160	Probably not after this Christmas though.
1066160	1069040	No! Stop it! No!
1069040	1071000	Paul's rant kind of goes on for a while.
1071000	1073080	He doesn't really have a point he's getting to
1073080	1075760	so much as he's mad a commercial has Muslims in it
1075760	1076760	for a few seconds.
1076760	1078360	He's mad it's a Twitter moment
1078360	1080360	and some people are applauding the diversity.
1080360	1082520	He's sure that a YouTube video being brigaded
1082520	1084920	by his followers and getting a couple of thousand dislikes
1084920	1088000	indicates actually it's very unpopular and so on.
1088000	1090080	You can even see in his face that he's struggling
1090080	1093200	to really articulate a decent justification to be angry.
1093200	1096040	Of course, there was a backlash to the backlash
1096040	1099880	which basically peaked yesterday with Twitter.
1099880	1102160	Twitter came out and said this was one of their
1102160	1104720	featured stories in their Twitter moments
1104720	1106680	which of course is on the homepage
1106680	1108400	when anybody goes onto Twitter.
1108400	1111800	Ha ha ha! Imagine this being your life.
1111840	1114000	It's stuff like this that really gives context
1114000	1116440	to tweets where he's mad at black celebrities
1116440	1117960	talking about racism,
1117960	1120840	calling them sanctimonious crybabies.
1120840	1123600	Saying Britain still has racism is annoying.
1123600	1125400	What's way more important and pressing
1125400	1127280	is the Tesco Christmas commercial.
1127280	1128760	He's also very sure this stuff
1128760	1130960	isn't Bill O'Reilly nonsense anymore.
1130960	1133480	It used to be, but it's real now.
1133480	1136280	It's no longer some Bill O'Reilly meme
1136280	1137600	when it's actually happening.
1137600	1139160	He keeps saying this over and over.
1139160	1140960	It's like boomer dubstep.
1141000	1142800	Now, I remember 10, 15 years ago,
1142800	1145000	this is something that Bill O'Reilly,
1145000	1148400	these other neocons would constantly bring up.
1148400	1152000	People would debunk it and say it's a false concern.
1152000	1153200	It's being exaggerated.
1153200	1154640	There's no war on Christmas.
1154640	1156920	What are you talking about? This is crazy.
1156920	1159520	Well, fast forward to 2017.
1159520	1162160	Everything Bill O'Reilly said, yeah, that was crazy,
1162160	1165480	but fast forward to the Tesco Christmas commercial.
1165480	1167040	The thing about Info Wars videos
1167040	1169280	which are recorded live on the actual show,
1169280	1170720	the ones where Alex is also there
1170720	1172400	and Paul's just calling in,
1172400	1176080	is that Paul is fundamentally not a very good live speaker.
1176080	1177880	I'm not saying this because I disagree
1177880	1180480	with his political views or to make fun of him.
1180480	1181720	He's a poor public speaker.
1181720	1183760	It's just not one of his skills, and that's fine.
1183760	1185640	Some people are just too self-conscious for it.
1185640	1187480	That's why he writes his videos in advance
1187480	1190400	and edits them with snappy cuts and always is yelling.
1190400	1192240	It makes his work hold people's attention,
1192240	1194800	but he just can't maintain that energy in a live setting.
1194800	1197480	Worse, his clear anxieties about what he's doing
1197480	1200120	start to come through when the spotlight's on him too long.
1200120	1202200	Sometimes he workshops his tweets in the pub
1202200	1204080	with his friends before he posts them.
1204080	1205080	No, I'm serious.
1205080	1207800	He shows the tweet on his phone to his friends and asks,
1207800	1209400	is this okay? Should I post it?
1209400	1210760	Looking for some kind of approval
1210760	1212400	with an anxious look on his face.
1212400	1215640	And it's a tweet petulantly quoting Stormzy out of context
1215640	1218240	in order to imply that he hates all white people,
1218240	1220680	and his remaining real-life friends nod and go,
1220680	1222040	yeah, sure, man.
1222040	1223480	I don't get why it's a big deal to you,
1223480	1225320	but I guess it's for your job, right?
1225320	1227320	And then one of them sends me a message about it later.
1227320	1229400	But anyway, my point is Paul isn't that great
1229400	1231400	at this whole live entertainment thing,
1231400	1233160	and there's a reason Alex Jones uses him
1233160	1235280	as sporadically as he can on his shows.
1235280	1237560	He's only got about five things to say,
1237560	1239560	and he has to keep saying them over and over.
1239560	1242080	So eventually Alex realizes he needs to jump in
1242080	1244280	and starts interrupting him with points of his own.
1244280	1246240	It's a Christmas ad for God's sake,
1246240	1247240	but here's the kicker.
1247240	1248480	It's like having a Christmas ad
1248480	1250840	where you drag Santa Claus behind a car.
1250840	1253520	Yeah, there'd be newspaper articles about it all week.
1253520	1256320	Well, Paul, this is cultural appropriation.
1256320	1258520	This is what the left's all about, is overriding,
1258520	1261160	taking control of everything, dominating culture.
1261160	1262560	All the headlines are like,
1262560	1264520	oh, you're so offended at seeing Muslims.
1264520	1266720	It's like, no, I'm offended at the fact,
1266720	1268920	or I'm perplexed at the fact there's no...
1268920	1270680	It'd be like if you had an ad saying,
1270680	1273840	this holiday season, support Ramadan
1273840	1275640	at your local halal stores,
1275640	1278360	and then it showed guys in Knights Templar uniforms
1278360	1279840	at the Muslim store.
1279840	1282200	The Muslim store.
1282200	1284600	The other big claim he's making in this war on Christmas bit
1284600	1285920	also has to do with Tesco.
1285920	1288640	Paul went to a Tesco's and noticed, to his horror,
1288640	1290440	that not enough things said Christmas,
1290440	1292360	so he whipped out his phone and took some pictures
1292360	1294280	to complain about on Twitter later.
1294280	1295600	There's a funny bit in this video
1295600	1297440	where Alex says he should have documented it,
1297440	1299560	not realizing Paul already had.
1299560	1301880	They've got these Christmas cards, Alex.
1301880	1303880	They call them, they've renamed them.
1303880	1306200	They're now called charity cards.
1306200	1309960	Paul, you gotta go back in and get some footage of this.
1309960	1311480	Well, I've got the pictures and I tweeted them,
1311480	1312640	but people said...
1312640	1314560	Just incredibly poor communication
1314560	1315680	going on at InfoWars.
1315720	1317640	The tweets themselves are really something.
1317640	1319520	Was in Tesco earlier.
1319520	1320440	Their entire...
1320440	1321280	I can't do his voice.
1321280	1322600	Their entire Christmas shelf,
1322600	1324680	cards, wrapping paper, confectionery,
1324680	1327560	not a single mention of the word Christmas.
1327560	1329400	Not a single one.
1329400	1332600	Christmas cards are now called charity cards.
1332600	1333760	Pathetic.
1333760	1336120	Truly pathetic.
1336120	1338120	Then he atted Tesco.
1338120	1339640	Yeah, this is Tesco speaking.
1339640	1340680	I'm sorry, Paul.
1340680	1342880	We'll put Christmas on the crack.
1342880	1345480	And before all you pointy heads claim
1345480	1347000	they're called charity cards
1347000	1349120	because some proceeds go to charity,
1349120	1350480	that's always been the case,
1350480	1352760	but they were still called Christmas cards.
1352760	1354520	It's not just the commercial.
1354520	1359000	At Tesco has capitulated to politically correct douchebaggery.
1359000	1360760	And then there's a picture of some crackers
1360760	1362600	and they're just called crackers.
1362600	1363840	You know, because that's their name.
1363840	1367400	They're not even calling them Christmas crackers anymore.
1367400	1370120	The war on Christmas used to be some far right,
1370120	1372120	evangelical, Bill O'Reilly.
1372120	1373520	Jesus Christ, Paul, we get it.
1373560	1375560	You don't have to say it that many times.
1375560	1376880	Truly saddening.
1376880	1377920	After all these years,
1377920	1381200	Tesco have finally started the war on Christmas for real.
1381200	1384640	There's no Christmas anywhere in Tesco anymore.
1384640	1386440	Not a single one.
1386440	1388120	However, eagle-eyed viewers,
1388120	1390080	well, frankly, eyed viewers
1390080	1391640	who take a look at the photograph
1391640	1392920	for more than a nanosecond
1392920	1395960	might start to notice things Paul somehow didn't notice
1395960	1398160	when he was literally standing there looking at them.
1398160	1400760	For example, if you zoom in on one of his own pictures,
1400760	1402360	you can actually see Merry Christmas
1402360	1403880	written on some of the crackers.
1403880	1405640	Some people went into their local Tesco
1405640	1407760	and found that Christmas was written everywhere.
1407760	1409880	Some people pointed out that these charity cards
1409880	1412440	were in a display marked Christmas cards
1412440	1415040	and still others looked at packs of these charity cards
1415040	1417360	and found that some of them say Merry Christmas on them.
1417360	1419960	Tesco also has Christmas all over its website
1419960	1422120	where it happens to refer to the charity cards
1422120	1424160	as charity Christmas cards.
1424160	1427240	The website also refers to crackers as Christmas crackers.
1427240	1428880	Not a single one.
1428880	1430840	These things were mentioned to Paul immediately
1430840	1433320	in response to the tweets when he made them a few years ago
1433320	1435440	and good fun was had by all laughing
1435440	1437320	at this sad middle-aged man
1437320	1439440	taking pictures in Tesco to whine about.
1439440	1441240	By far the funniest bit of this video
1441240	1443280	is when they cut to a feed of Paul's tweet thread
1443280	1445440	about the Tesco stuff and when they're scrolling down,
1445440	1447080	they accidentally scroll to the tweet
1447080	1449520	pointing out Christmas is literally on the packaging
1449520	1452160	and then whoever's doing the screen capture panics,
1452160	1454240	zooms out, and scrolls down one more
1454240	1456920	and it's the one pointing out Christmas is on the website
1456920	1459480	and they just have to awkwardly fade back to Paul
1459480	1460800	saying it's not all made up.
1460800	1462200	This is definitely real.
1462200	1466040	Now, I mean, this is not some kind of Bill O'Reilly meme
1466040	1468240	from the early 2000s anymore.
1468240	1469560	This is actually happening.
1469560	1471760	No, I get it, Paul. It's not just Bill O'Reilly anymore.
1471760	1473400	You made that point already. Move on.
1473400	1476840	This is a deliberate Orwellian process
1476840	1479840	of eliminating words, changing language
1479840	1483080	for the purposes of some lame nod at political correctness.
1483080	1484720	Okay, some of you might be confused at this point
1484720	1485960	so let's just get this straight.
1485960	1489320	The far left who, as we all know, run Tesco
1489320	1491360	are trying to undermine culture
1491360	1493560	because they're worried about sounding racist
1493560	1496840	so they're doing this by not letting stores
1496840	1499760	put Christmas anywhere except in the stores,
1499760	1502880	the products in the stores, and on the website.
1502880	1504720	There, sorted. See?
1504720	1506720	It's the Marxists at it again.
1506720	1509680	I went into Tesco on Saturday,
1509680	1512760	went to the Christmas section of the store.
1512760	1514600	Not one mention of Christmas.
1514600	1516520	They don't even mention the word Christmas.
1516520	1518160	Paul, of course they did.
1518200	1521200	That's how you know it's the Christmas section!
1521200	1523720	That's why every year I know exactly where the elves are.
1523720	1525480	You can't hide from me.
1525480	1527840	Now, there is one minor thing worth talking about here.
1527840	1531680	One teensy, tiny thing that Paul might not have thought about
1531680	1534040	which is that one of the reasons why Christmas
1534040	1536240	isn't written on everything is because you already know
1536240	1537520	it's for Christmas.
1537520	1539640	All the Christmas stuff is only in stores
1539640	1542960	in the Christmas season for you to buy for Christmas.
1542960	1545960	They're neatly arranged in special red aisles
1545960	1548560	so you know where to look for the Christmas stuff.
1548560	1552640	Putting Christmas on every single thing is just pointless.
1552640	1555280	This isn't even to do with political correctness.
1555280	1557040	It's just basic store design.
1557040	1558920	They don't feel the need to acknowledge Christmas
1558920	1561720	on the label because Christmas is being acknowledged
1561720	1564240	at every other point in this transaction.
1564240	1566240	Oh, no, the label of this wrapping paper
1566240	1568160	doesn't say Christmas wrapping paper.
1568160	1571120	Help, I'm being tricked into forgetting my religion exists.
1571120	1574760	Oh, Christmas is written all over the fucking wrapping paper?
1574760	1577920	Oh, well, I guess I'll celebrate Christmas again this year.
1577920	1580520	God, the cultural Marxists had better get their act together
1580520	1581920	if they're gonna win this war.
1581920	1583960	Ugh, ah, fuck, ugh.
1583960	1586440	Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.
1586440	1589600	There, that's probably structurally stable, right?
1589600	1591920	Now, one might say, ah, it's not fair
1591920	1594400	to go after an old InfoWars video.
1594400	1597080	What if InfoWars have spontaneously become smart
1597080	1599720	and rational now and cleverly moved on
1599720	1602120	from a topic that they got obliterated on
1602120	1604720	when people looked at their own photos?
1604720	1606200	Well, yeah, they did.
1606200	1608520	They dropped the topic and decided to move on
1608520	1610240	to doing real journalism.
1610240	1611880	I'm kidding, they did another one this year.
1611880	1614800	Alex Jones goes to the Texas state capital
1614800	1617360	to witness the city of Austin's Christmas tree
1617360	1620000	and expose the anti-Christian agenda
1620000	1621760	hidden in plain sight.
1621760	1623560	The banner beneath the tree that reads,
1623560	1624720	Happy Holidays.
1624720	1627200	Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen.
1627200	1628840	Merry Christmas.
1628840	1630560	And it's about Jesus Christ.
1630560	1632600	It's not about the big corporations
1632600	1635200	and the chi-com atheists and the globalists.
1635200	1637160	I think the existence of videos like this
1637160	1639400	really crystallizes what the war on Christmas
1639400	1640760	is actually about.
1640760	1642480	Bullshit artists like InfoWars
1642480	1643960	have to play a very careful game
1643960	1645240	to survive and make money.
1645240	1647440	InfoWars can't make money as a news website
1647440	1649400	because they don't actually do any journalism
1649400	1650840	so no one comes to them for that
1650840	1652440	and they can't easily sell advertisements
1652440	1653640	on their website or videos
1653640	1655240	because for unknown reasons,
1655240	1657600	barely anyone wants to be associated with them.
1657600	1659480	It starts out with, don't use the N-word.
1659480	1660880	Well, I don't use that, so okay.
1660880	1663040	And the next it's, oh, don't say Merry Christmas.
1663040	1664040	Say Happy Holidays.
1664040	1665240	Yeah, those are the same thing.
1665240	1666760	Eh, I never thought of it that way.
1666760	1669480	Imagine a shoe company looking for somewhere to advertise
1669480	1670680	and seeing one of these videos
1670680	1671760	and it's Alex Jones going,
1671760	1672880	remember when they tricked us
1672880	1674720	into not saying the N-word anymore?
1674720	1676600	Well, Happy Holidays is just like that.
1676600	1677720	They're probably gonna say no
1677720	1679120	but Alex Jones has this problem
1679120	1682040	which is that he really, really likes expensive watches.
1682040	1683760	He loves to wear Rolexes on his show
1683760	1685040	and according to court records,
1685040	1687440	he once bought four of them in a single day.
1687440	1689360	The cheapest one I could find him wearing
1689360	1691400	cost around $12,000.
1691400	1693440	So obviously he needs a lot of money to live
1693440	1695040	and how's he gonna do that?
1695040	1697720	Why, he'd have to develop some kind of business model
1697720	1700160	that revolves around exploiting gullible people.
1700160	1703560	So their best bet is to target a very specific demographic.
1703560	1706600	In this case, conservatives with a conspiratorial streak
1706600	1708640	validate them by telling them that they're right
1708640	1709680	and then going, hey,
1709680	1711640	if you want to become even more powerful,
1711640	1713000	check out our pills.
1713000	1715280	Also get all you need to completely stuff
1715280	1716520	Christmas stockings this year
1716560	1718560	with our Christmas Mega Pack.
1718560	1722240	So it starts with, don't say Merry Christmas,
1722240	1723360	and it ends with,
1723360	1726280	they create an orthodox centralized system as well
1726280	1730120	that is gonna be welded in to the new fascist left west
1730120	1731200	and out of that marriage,
1731200	1734720	you will have the communist socialist system
1734720	1736520	of Islam merged with that.
1736520	1738480	I mean, this sentence doesn't make sense.
1738480	1739320	It just doesn't.
1739320	1740960	It's a list of keywords
1740960	1742800	but just making fun of how dumb this all is
1742800	1746120	would be to ignore why he still does it and why it works.
1746120	1748680	On topics like this, I find myself constantly coming back
1748680	1750560	to a great paper by Cormac Hurley,
1750560	1752200	a principal researcher at Microsoft,
1752200	1754800	about Nigerian email scams and how they function.
1754800	1757080	You know how the Nigerian email scams
1757080	1759680	usually have very poor language usage and grammar
1759680	1761640	and even say they're from Nigeria
1761640	1763560	even though if you Google Nigeria,
1763560	1765800	one of the first results is email scam
1765800	1768400	and that makes them an obvious scam to most people?
1768400	1770760	This is actually part of how the scam works
1770760	1772760	because their targets are the sort of people
1772760	1774640	who won't notice the writing problems
1774640	1776480	because they tend to be the sort of people
1776480	1777960	who end up giving them money.
1777960	1780160	If you're smart enough to not fall for that part,
1780160	1782040	they don't want you wasting their time
1782040	1785000	and they've quite smartly selected you out of the process
1785000	1786080	by writing poorly.
1786080	1788520	Since gullibility is unobservable,
1788520	1790320	the best strategy is to get those
1790320	1792800	who possess this quality to self-identify.
1792800	1795280	Infowars is following a similar business practice.
1795280	1797200	Alex Jones's objective is to make money
1797200	1798880	to sustain his expensive lifestyle
1798880	1800400	where he eats watches or something
1800400	1802400	and to do that, he needs to target an audience
1802400	1805240	who will be fooled into buying his overpriced stuff.
1805240	1807680	So by talking absolute nonsense,
1807680	1810360	yes, Jones is turning away everyone with half a brain,
1810360	1812800	but people with half a brain generally are quite hard
1812800	1816000	to sell the world's most expensive protein bars,
1816000	1819840	ultimate fish oil, and, uh, Ultra 12.
1819840	1822160	Jones is deliberately laser targeting
1822160	1824400	the kind of people who would hear a phrase like
1824400	1827120	the communist socialist system of Islam
1827120	1828760	and think, wow, that's bad.
1828760	1831040	That's really bad. That's three bad things I hate.
1831040	1832960	How do I stop that thing that must be happening
1832960	1835000	because the man with the nice watch said it was?
1835000	1837280	Which leaves them open to being sold the idea
1837280	1840080	that keeping Infowars afloat by buying their stuff
1840080	1842400	is basically the same as showing you're a hero
1842400	1845360	fighting back against these very real problems
1845360	1846720	and for the people who fall for it,
1846720	1849760	it is a real ego boost which creates a loyal fan base
1849760	1851160	full of repeat customers.
1851160	1853400	Nobody finds these videos convincing,
1853400	1856640	but the people therefore find them reassuring.
1856640	1858720	What you call weird conspiracy theorists
1858720	1859800	who need validation,
1859800	1862480	some people call a marketable demographic,
1862480	1864240	but to keep this machine going,
1864240	1867400	Jones has to find increasingly outlandish things to say
1867400	1868960	to hold these people's attention
1868960	1871000	and come up with reasons to keep supporting him
1871000	1872400	and fighting the Infowar,
1872400	1874400	and that means getting more and more ridiculous
1874400	1876200	as the infinite eternal threat
1876200	1878600	only gets even more infinitely threatening.
1878600	1881240	Not only does this dance get increasingly difficult,
1881240	1883800	they've also discovered that you can't just say lies
1883800	1885240	about people, it turns out.
1885240	1887800	If they say ridiculous bullshit about real people,
1887800	1890480	they risk being sued for libel or defamation
1890480	1892680	as is the case with the Sandy Hook parents
1892680	1895080	who are in the process of fucking destroying
1895080	1897800	Jones in court for telling his sizable audience
1897800	1900160	that the parents of murdered children
1900160	1902920	are all just paid actors and it was a fake shooting,
1902920	1905440	so the war on Christmas is a real boon for Jones
1905440	1907000	because he can just go hog wild
1907000	1908360	about whatever comes into his head,
1908360	1909560	just make up whatever,
1909560	1910880	and occasionally cut to footage
1910880	1912240	of a tree being pushed over
1912240	1914240	or some random act of vandalism
1914240	1915720	and explain how they're all connected
1915720	1917320	by a web of destruction
1917320	1920920	by the secret Muslim communist anti-family coalition
1920920	1922360	and it's so incomprehensible
1922360	1924680	it can't even be considered defamation of anyone.
1924680	1926600	This is the kind of nonsense safe zone
1926600	1929240	Infowars has to live in to avoid destroying itself
1929240	1931680	by getting owned in court which is why,
1931680	1933320	for legal reasons,
1933320	1935440	I'm required to mention that story I told earlier
1935440	1937600	about Paul Joseph Watson is not true.
1937600	1939800	I made it up. Those DMs are fake.
1939800	1942480	I thought it would be a funny joke to show how shitty it is
1942480	1943880	to make things up about people.
1943920	1946040	However, even though I made it up,
1946040	1947320	it definitely did happen.
1947320	1950080	The war on Christmas is a safe bet for Jones to cover
1950080	1952560	since there's no obvious tangible negative effect
1952560	1954560	on real people except his audience
1954560	1956400	whose minds he is completely ruining
1956400	1957480	but that's their choice.
1957480	1959240	As what some French people might call
1959240	1962040	a connoisseur of Infowars garbage,
1962040	1964320	so I guess it's me whose life they're ruining,
1964320	1967120	this is my favorite kind of the schlock they do
1967120	1968680	where Alex just grabs a cameraman
1968680	1971480	and goes out in public and just makes a bunch of noise
1971480	1973480	and runs around annoying people
1973480	1975280	and getting to arguments with whoever he can get
1975280	1977520	his soy-stained hands on.
1977520	1979680	Sometimes he forgets that trying to cite data
1979680	1981280	opens him up to being punked
1981280	1982840	and accidentally offers statistics
1982840	1985440	that can be easily rebuked with simple explanations
1985440	1986560	and then they have to leave it in
1986560	1988760	because that's the best footage they got that night.
1988760	1990400	There is a war on Christmas.
1990400	1992560	There is a war on Christianity.
1992560	1993440	Did you know that more than half
1993440	1994760	of all religious persecution in the world
1994760	1996040	is against Christians?
1996040	1999000	I believe it. I mean, we're one of the largest groups.
1999000	2000960	Oh. So statistically,
2000960	2002520	if there's attack on a region,
2002520	2004520	there's gonna be a lot of attack on Christians.
2004520	2005520	Uh...
2005520	2007520	♪ Somebody wants to kill... ♪
2007520	2009880	Once that kid politely shakes his hand and leaves,
2009880	2011240	Jones starts losing it,
2011240	2013800	just screaming Merry Christmas into the void,
2013800	2016440	talking about how free he is from control.
2016440	2018720	Merry Christmas!
2018720	2020520	We're not surrendering, ladies and gentlemen.
2020520	2022280	America and the world is awake.
2022280	2023520	Freedom is rising,
2023520	2025520	and Merry Christmas from Infowars.com.
2025520	2028720	But then he remembers that the point of all this
2028720	2029920	is to push his products,
2029920	2031160	so then there's another few minutes
2031160	2033480	where he calms down and talks about the great deals
2033480	2035960	you can get at InfowarsStore.com.
2035960	2037160	There's a war on Christmas.
2037160	2038280	There's a war on America.
2038280	2039880	There's a war on our free speech.
2039880	2042880	There's a war on the family's very existence.
2042880	2046440	And those very same forces that have it out for Christianity
2046440	2047720	have it out for Infowars
2047720	2049960	and have it out for you and your family.
2049960	2052160	But we need you to go to InfowarsStore.com
2052160	2052880	this Christmas.
2052880	2054240	We need you to fund Infowars
2054240	2055440	by getting great products you need.
2055440	2057200	We've got huge sales going right now.
2057200	2059320	And this completes the selection process.
2059320	2062200	After spending 15 minutes literally just running around
2062200	2063680	and screaming at people,
2063680	2066320	anyone still watching is probably a prime target
2066320	2067360	for his advertising.
2067360	2070400	So you get three whole minutes of him explaining to you
2070400	2072200	how cheap the deals are.
2072200	2074400	Everything's still more expensive than the equivalent
2074400	2076200	you can find at, like, any other store.
2076200	2077120	But that's not the point.
2077120	2079680	The point is you're supporting the Info War.
2079680	2082240	You're saving the world with free speech
2082240	2085320	and fight bad men.
2085320	2087520	I'm so glad I can fight back against control
2088480	2090480	by purchasing iodine.
2090480	2092440	So we find here that the War on Christmas
2092440	2094720	is a decent way of getting very gullible people
2094720	2096000	to pay attention long enough
2096000	2098360	that you can direct sell them diet supplements.
2098360	2100360	And we've seen how for people whose business model
2100360	2102440	involves straying close to legal action,
2102440	2105120	something ridiculous and silly like the War on Christmas
2105120	2106400	is kinda a gimme.
2106400	2108840	You can accuse the bad people coalition
2108840	2111800	of secret Christmas crimes and you're safe
2111800	2114880	because imaginary people you made up can't sue you.
2114880	2116960	However, we still haven't fully discovered
2116960	2119720	why the War on Christmas specifically has
2119720	2122360	such a strong appeal to the kinds of sad people
2122360	2124480	who make up Info War's customer base
2124480	2126880	or why conservatives see such an appeal
2126880	2129680	in believing Christmas is under attack in the first place.
2129680	2132760	So to find out more, I, uh, got bored
2132760	2135320	and decided to invent a new recipe for eggnog.
2135320	2136720	Well, there you have it.
2136720	2138480	The War on Christmas is over.
2138480	2141400	And I guess Christmas won because it turned out
2141400	2144840	that there never was a war on it.
2144840	2147680	Oh, well. I think eggs go bad pretty quick, don't they?
2147680	2149840	♪♪
2149840	2153600	Oh, my tummy and brain.
2153600	2155560	I microwaved this earlier to warm it up
2155560	2157880	and now there's definitely bits of paint loose in it.
2157880	2158880	Thanks, Neil.
2158880	2162320	Oh, I think I'm cross-faded on paint fumes and alcohol.
2162320	2164120	Oh, no, it's happening.
2164120	2167640	I've lost enough IQ points that I think IQ is real
2167640	2169160	and that means I'm fucked up enough
2169160	2170960	to watch a PragerU video.
2170960	2173480	PragerU is a YouTube channel funded by oil
2173480	2175880	and fracking barons and other related think tanks
2175880	2177920	which likes to masquerade as a university.
2177920	2180320	Honestly, you don't even need to look up the topics they cover.
2180320	2182160	If you find a list of their major donors,
2182160	2184000	you can pretty easily guess the entirety
2184000	2185120	of their video output.
2185120	2186600	They make five-minute long videos
2186600	2188960	which feature next to no research or evidence
2188960	2191280	but they have a lot of money to spend on infographics
2191280	2193400	and getting special guests to read their scripts
2193400	2195960	and that's basically the same thing as being true.
2195960	2198080	This one on the War on Christmas is called
2198080	2199840	Just Say Merry Christmas.
2199840	2201640	This is the usual stuff we've seen before
2201640	2203080	but presented in a new way.
2203080	2205720	I mean, literally, it's just a repurposed Bill O'Reilly script
2205720	2208440	complete with an aside about how it's the secularists' fault.
2208440	2210040	The opponents of Merry Christmas
2210040	2211960	and other uses of the word Christmas
2211960	2213680	know exactly what they're doing.
2213680	2216480	The opponents of Christmas? What the fuck?
2216480	2218920	They're disingenuous when they dismiss defenders
2218920	2221840	of Merry Christmas as fabricating some,
2221840	2224240	quote, war on Christmas.
2224240	2227000	Of course it's a war on Christmas
2227000	2228800	or more precisely,
2228800	2231520	a war on the religious nature of America.
2231560	2233280	When I first watched this video,
2233280	2235000	this image kept coming back to me
2235000	2236920	of a person who says happy holidays
2236920	2239920	and laughs at people who think the war on Christmas is real
2239920	2242360	morphing into an enemy combatant.
2242360	2244480	Why was this imagery necessary?
2244480	2246240	Why take people laughing at you
2246240	2248040	for believing a made-up thing,
2248040	2251080	accuse them of knowing exactly what they're doing,
2251080	2252760	and then reveal them to be trying
2252760	2255360	to destroy America's nature?
2255360	2258960	And then I realized that this is the actual core
2258960	2260040	of the whole thing.
2260040	2261920	This image actually explains
2261920	2263880	more about the conservative ideology
2263880	2265600	than anything else we've covered here.
2265600	2268400	You see, Dennis Prager and ideologues like him
2268400	2270280	have for quite a while been encountering
2270280	2272080	this one small problem,
2272080	2274040	which is that their ideas are wrong.
2274040	2276800	This is why, if you watch any of PragerU's other videos,
2276800	2278680	they're full of completely hysterical,
2278680	2280000	imaginary graphs,
2280000	2282040	most of which don't even label their axes.
2282040	2282880	What even is this?
2282880	2285280	And often they make outright false claims
2285280	2286720	and tell clear lies.
2286720	2288880	Sometimes they fabricate ridiculous quotes
2288880	2290760	and put quotations around them as if to say,
2290760	2292120	look at this ridiculous thing
2292120	2294080	people who disagree with you say,
2294080	2296320	but the quote is something they made up.
2296320	2297880	No one actually said this.
2297880	2300760	They made it up and attributed it to some imaginary enemy
2300760	2303080	to try to convince you that this is what people
2303080	2305760	who aren't like you believe, so you must be right.
2305760	2309400	This constant lying and misrepresentation of reality
2309400	2311120	makes my point for me.
2311120	2313720	To get you to believe what they believe,
2313720	2317600	they have to lie because the truth simply isn't enough
2317640	2318960	to support these beliefs.
2318960	2321160	The bulk of PragerU consists of strategies
2321160	2323920	to get around the fact they don't have a leg to stand on
2323920	2325200	when it comes to the truth,
2325200	2327400	and this is where the war on Christmas
2327400	2330120	and similar conspiracy theories comes in
2330120	2332720	because when a belief system is on shaky ground
2332720	2333960	when it comes to the truth,
2333960	2336240	it needs something else to maintain it,
2336240	2339240	extra beliefs and fantasies to prop it all up.
2339240	2343320	Otherwise, doubts and anxieties start to come in.
2343320	2344760	What if I'm wrong?
2344760	2346800	What if I've missed something?
2346800	2349120	What if other people are laughing at me?
2349120	2351760	What better way to put a stop to these feelings
2351760	2353600	than to convince yourself your enemies
2353600	2355840	are trying to destroy your culture,
2355840	2357520	even your holidays,
2357520	2359880	that they're even doing it on purpose
2359880	2361520	and know they're doing it
2361520	2364440	because they're the bad guys and you're the good guys?
2364440	2367000	Instantly, all your doubts and fears
2367000	2368440	that you've missed something,
2368440	2371440	all critical thinking can be dismissed.
2371440	2374360	Life stops being about reason or evidence
2374360	2376200	and starts being about the war
2376200	2379080	to protect your ways from the bad ways.
2379080	2381600	Right and wrong don't matter anymore.
2381600	2385600	They are conspiring to destroy you.
2385600	2387840	When you don't say Merry Christmas,
2387840	2390600	you're stealing my holiday from me.
2390600	2392040	They even have a little animation
2392040	2394280	where a kid beats up Santa Claus.
2394280	2397080	This is how persecuted the far right
2397080	2399120	need to convince themselves they are
2399120	2401680	to escape from the much simpler conclusion
2401680	2404680	that some of the things they believe aren't true.
2404680	2407000	Everyone has to be out to get them.
2407000	2408760	Even by saying Happy Holidays,
2408760	2410920	you're kicking the shit out of their dreams.
2410920	2414000	Imagine something you enjoy, something you love.
2414000	2415440	The bad guys hate it.
2415440	2417880	They'll call it racist and patriarchal
2417880	2419160	and try to destroy it.
2419160	2421880	You're smart. You think good things.
2421880	2423920	Their ideas are weird and strange.
2423920	2426440	It's okay. It's okay.
2426440	2428800	You can go back to sleep.
2428800	2435240	♪♪
2435240	2436680	You don't have to think too hard
2436680	2438480	about the fine details of your beliefs
2438480	2440760	if you also think people are out to get you
2440760	2441760	for believing them.
2441760	2442760	You don't have to think about
2442760	2444960	why the evidence or data contradicts you.
2444960	2447440	The bad guys are out to destroy your culture,
2447440	2449200	so they probably made it all up.
2449200	2451400	It's like we're so busy in America
2451400	2452800	trying to promote tolerance,
2452800	2456280	but this tolerance is intolerating everything
2456280	2457800	except Christianity.
2457840	2460200	You look at Christians as narrow-minded bigots,
2460200	2461880	but the opposite is actually true.
2461880	2463760	Christianity is being bigoted against.
2463760	2464840	We're under attack.
2464840	2467880	If you're against my intolerance of others,
2467880	2469560	you're attacking me.
2469560	2472080	Conservative Christians must be the real victims
2472080	2473600	of bigotry in the world.
2473600	2474880	I'm not wrong.
2474880	2477440	There's just a war against my beliefs.
2477440	2478520	How convenient.
2478520	2481560	And it's once again the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
2481560	2483480	that is under attack, but the Bible says,
2483480	2486280	no weapon formed against us shall be able to prosper.
2487280	2488400	So we're gonna be all right.
2488400	2490920	Tell that to Constantinople, baby!
2490920	2492120	Ha ha ha ha!
2492120	2493880	Prager ends his video by summing up
2493880	2495560	his victim complex for me.
2495560	2497520	By not wishing me a Merry Christmas,
2497520	2500000	you are not being inclusive.
2500000	2502160	You are excluding me
2502160	2505120	from one of my nation's national holidays.
2505120	2508680	So please, say Merry Christmas
2508680	2510680	and Christmas party
2510680	2513080	and Christmas vacation.
2513160	2517040	If you don't, you're not inclusive.
2517040	2518200	You're hurtful.
2518200	2520960	Private military contractors,
2520960	2524560	on the other hand, are fine!
2524560	2526040	What the fuck?!
2526040	2528280	Ah, what a delightfully unbiased video.
2528280	2529880	No political agenda here.
2529880	2532480	This course was made possible by a generous donation
2532480	2535120	from Reagan.com!
2535120	2537520	A great example of how this imaginary sense
2537520	2539760	of victimhood excuses flaws in the rest
2539760	2542240	of the belief system is present in this video.
2542240	2544160	Prager briefly sums up what he calls
2544160	2546200	the inclusiveness argument.
2546200	2547760	Let's see how he summarizes it.
2547760	2550040	That Merry Christmas or Christmas party
2550040	2553520	or Christmas vacation is not inclusive.
2553520	2555960	Now, what he's saying kind of makes sense here, doesn't it?
2555960	2558840	If there's going to be an event during the holiday season
2558840	2561400	that's traditionally called a Christmas party
2561400	2563480	but some people who don't celebrate Christmas
2563480	2565080	might also be invited to it,
2565080	2568400	some people might argue that calling it a holiday party
2568400	2571160	is a more appropriate name than a Christmas party.
2571160	2573600	Now, personally, I don't think it really matters
2573600	2576080	what you call a party and I also don't really think
2576080	2578840	many non-Christians will decide not to go to an event
2578840	2581120	simply because it's called a Christmas event
2581120	2585120	but I do see the overall point of the inclusiveness argument.
2585120	2587560	It is maybe a little more appropriate a name
2587560	2589760	for a gathering of people and I don't really think
2589760	2591960	there's anything wrong with naming something like that
2591960	2593800	in the hopes it makes some people feel
2593800	2595440	more recognized and included.
2595440	2596600	It's just not a big deal.
2596600	2598720	The argument seems fairly decent to me.
2598720	2601600	So what is Dennis' rebuttal to this argument?
2601600	2604400	Well, his problem is he doesn't really have one.
2604400	2606920	He simply asks who is really being excluded
2606920	2609560	and uses this to segue into an actually unrelated
2609560	2611480	final point which we'll get to later
2611480	2613840	but his actual rebuttal is provided
2613840	2615600	in how he presents this argument
2615600	2618200	which is that this entire argument is just a trick
2618200	2620000	you shouldn't listen to at all.
2620000	2622840	Let's look at how he sets up the inclusiveness argument
2622840	2623800	in the video.
2623800	2626200	Activists on the left will eventually seek
2626200	2630200	to remove Christmas as a national holiday.
2630200	2632560	Now, the left doesn't announce that its agenda
2632560	2636480	is to thoroughly secularize American and European societies.
2636480	2640240	Instead, they offer the inclusiveness argument.
2640240	2643600	The leftist secularists, an all-powerful cult,
2643600	2646160	are trying to change the nature of America
2646160	2648760	but they can't just walk around all day saying,
2648760	2651240	I'm evil and want to destroy Christmas
2651240	2653760	so they came up with this argument instead
2653760	2656760	but it's not their real reason so you should ignore it.
2656760	2659160	The argument might sound reasonable
2659160	2660840	but you shouldn't think about it
2660840	2663560	because they're bad and have an evil agenda.
2663560	2666680	This masks the actual truth
2666680	2668480	which is that the inclusiveness argument
2668480	2670120	is actually fairly cogent.
2670120	2672960	Dennis can't give a rebuttal to that
2672960	2675800	because it's a really simple, small point
2675800	2677320	that just makes sense
2677320	2679720	but admitting that means conceding
2679720	2682680	that sometimes it's nice to make people feel included
2682680	2686080	which destroys the entire war on Christmas argument
2686080	2690000	so instead, he reframes the argument as a fake trick
2690000	2693800	by a group of people who want to remove religion from society
2693800	2696880	who are only pretending to want people to feel included
2696880	2699360	and this is how persecution complexes function
2699360	2701400	in making people retain their ideas.
2701400	2703280	If you make a decent enough argument
2703280	2705080	that they can't give a rebuttal to,
2705080	2707720	they can just fantasize about how it's a trick.
2707720	2709400	This inclusive argument plays
2709400	2712480	on Americans' highly developed sense of decency.
2712480	2715800	They're just trying to play on your sense of decency
2715800	2719680	as opposed to expecting you to do a really basic decent thing.
2719680	2722040	It's all part of the secret secularist plot
2722040	2725320	by the secularists to bring about their state religion,
2725320	2726560	secularism.
2726560	2728160	Most people do not realize
2728160	2730680	that the left believes in secularism
2730680	2733880	as fervently as religious Jews and Christians
2733880	2735080	believe in the Bible.
2736800	2738360	I'm sorry, what?
2738360	2742280	That doesn't make any fucking sense, Dennis!
2742280	2743600	What does that mean?
2743600	2746080	Who the fuck do secularists pray to?
2746080	2747720	Fucking Aquaman?
2747720	2748840	I did it. I did the joke.
2748840	2749920	I did the thing again.
2749920	2751120	Do you remember it? Do you remember?
2751120	2752120	Do you remember?
2752120	2757240	♪♪
2757240	2758680	So there we have it.
2758680	2761520	I think we figured out the purpose of the war on Christmas.
2761520	2763520	Sometimes it's to grab people's attention
2763520	2765400	either to sell advertising space
2765400	2768920	or to directly sell supplements, soy pills, and buttons,
2768920	2771720	but on a deeper level, it's a fantasy of victimhood
2771720	2774040	that helps to support an underlying belief system
2774040	2776480	that doesn't have facts to support it otherwise.
2776480	2777760	You're not wrong.
2777760	2779880	They're just out to get you.
2779880	2781040	Who's they?
2781040	2783160	It's whoever you want it to be.
2783160	2785680	Oh, and here's one last quick incidental thing
2785680	2787520	that happens to tie all of this together.
2787520	2789120	Prager's old war on Christmas video
2789120	2791200	fills time by talking about how a Jewish person
2791200	2792600	wrote White Christmas.
2792600	2794040	That's why it's not surprising
2794040	2796560	that it was an American Jew, Irving Berlin,
2796560	2798240	who wrote White Christmas,
2798240	2801120	one of America's most popular Christmas songs.
2801120	2803200	In fact, according to a Jewish musician
2803200	2805360	writing in the New York Times,
2805360	2808360	almost all the most popular Christmas songs
2808360	2810400	were written by Jews.
2810400	2812320	Apparently, all these American Jews
2812320	2815640	felt quite included by Christmas.
2815640	2817040	So there we go.
2817040	2820400	Non-Christians will never feel excluded by Christmas
2820400	2821840	because 70 years ago,
2821840	2825040	a Jewish person wrote a song with Christmas in it.
2825040	2827640	Dennis thinks this is a great point,
2827640	2829080	and you can tell he thinks it's great
2829080	2830480	because he wrote it into the script
2830480	2833040	for this year's video about Christmas as well.
2833040	2835400	And in perfect melting pot fashion,
2835400	2838080	Irving Berlin, the son of a rabbi,
2838080	2840120	wrote the definitive Yuletide song,
2840120	2841160	White Christmas.
2841160	2842360	Ah, it's such a clever point.
2842360	2844080	You might as well use it twice.
2844080	2845600	Unfortunately for Dennis,
2845600	2847160	Irving Berlin didn't just write
2847160	2849280	exactly one song about Christmas
2849280	2851000	then disappear into the void.
2851000	2853160	He actually lived on and wrote a few songs
2853160	2855280	that might even be a bit inconvenient
2855280	2856680	for Dennis' argument.
2856680	2858560	He also composed a little ditty
2858600	2860760	called Happy Holiday.
2860760	2863080	That's right. The same guy behind White Christmas
2863080	2866320	also wrote the other incredibly iconic Christmas song,
2866320	2867760	the one that opened and closed
2867760	2870400	Bing Crosby's big Christmas show for many years.
2870400	2871920	Apparently, Irving Berlin wrote
2871920	2873720	Happy Holidays into his lyrics
2873720	2876360	because that's a completely normal thing to say,
2876360	2878400	and the use of the phrase has nothing to do
2878400	2880040	with political correctness.
2880040	2882000	Incidentally, White Christmas was composed
2882000	2883560	for a film called Holiday Inn,
2883560	2885800	which also has Happy Holiday on the soundtrack.
2885800	2887880	This fact isn't particularly meaningful here,
2887920	2889040	but I thought it was funny.
2889040	2891440	Dennis Prager obviously knows all this.
2891440	2893080	If he knows about Irving Berlin,
2893080	2895360	he surely knows his other popular songs
2895360	2896360	and their titles.
2896360	2897520	He's not stupid.
2897520	2900560	He knows it's normal to say Happy Holidays at Christmas.
2900560	2902040	It's impossible to miss this fact
2902040	2903760	even if you do basic research.
2903760	2906240	Hell, even one of the articles he cites in the video
2906240	2908840	mentions that White Christmas was written for Holiday Inn,
2908840	2911480	but for his videos, he performatively pretends
2911480	2913680	these facts don't exist because PragerU
2913680	2915720	is a fake university designed to sell
2915720	2918560	a broken belief system so its donors can continue
2918560	2920360	to profit from the status quo,
2920360	2921440	and at the end of the day,
2921440	2924080	isn't that what Christmas is all about?
2924080	2926480	No. Well, it shouldn't be, but it is.
2926480	2927680	Wow, with motion graphics,
2927680	2929240	you can strawman people easily.
2929240	2931360	Great idea, Dennis, but what are you gonna do
2931360	2933280	if other people start doing it to you?
2933280	2934280	Oh, his mouth fell off.
2934280	2936240	Merry Christmas, everyone.
2936240	2937720	See? I can say it,
2937720	2940160	and I'm king of the male feminists,
2940160	2942080	so clearly there's no problem here.
2942080	2944440	Other people do have holidays around now though,
2944480	2947000	so happy holidays might be more appropriate
2947000	2948680	in some circumstances.
2948680	2951120	Anyway, if you're angry
2951120	2955440	and you need a reason to be angry to do with Christmas,
2955440	2956600	go to therapy.
2956600	2958200	Just go to therapy.
2958200	2960960	If you're angry and you think it's because lesbians
2960960	2962560	are in a Christmas thing,
2962560	2964040	you're not actually angry
2964040	2966000	because people are corrupting Christmas
2966000	2969040	or infecting your traditions and culture.
2969040	2969880	You're not even angry
2969880	2972240	because of political correctness or leftism.
2972280	2974560	You're angry because you feel expected to be,
2974560	2977400	because you've built a cage for your mind,
2977400	2978840	and the solution to that
2978840	2980880	is to change things about yourself.
2980880	2982880	Sorry, there isn't anything wrong
2982880	2984960	that needs to be fixed with the world.
2984960	2986080	That's you.
2986080	2988360	I wouldn't be so sure, Harris.
2988360	2990480	♪♪
2990480	2993160	Oh, Fortnite Tower Recon Specialist!
2993160	2994000	You're alive!
2994000	2996840	Yes, thanks to the magic of Christmas,
2996840	2998160	I'm real now,
2998160	3001160	and I'm going to take you on an adventure of discovery
3001160	3003760	until you convert to whatever Kirk Cameron thinks
3003760	3005120	is Christianity.
3007440	3010320	You know, like in reactionary Christian movies.
3010320	3012040	What is this, a Nostalgia Critic video?
3012040	3012880	We're not doing that.
3012880	3016000	We're not parodying a whole movie genre now.
3016000	3017320	This is the end of the video.
3017320	3018160	We're done.
3018160	3020240	But movie parodies are automatically funny
3020240	3021800	if you know what they're referencing,
3021800	3023480	so it's easy content,
3023480	3026000	and you make videos slowly enough already.
3026000	3028760	This way, half the script writes itself.
3028760	3030480	Yeah, for the first few minutes, maybe,
3030480	3031760	but I can't sustain a whole...
3031760	3033040	You know, I'm sick of this bit, too.
3033040	3034000	We're done.
3034000	3034840	That's the end.
3034840	3035760	You can't just end a video
3035760	3038040	because you gave up on your own storyline.
3038040	3040240	Happy winter-enmas, everybody.
3040240	3042280	♪♪
3042280	3043120	Christmas.
3043120	3047120	♪♪
3047120	3051120	♪♪
3051120	3052800	Well, we did it.
3052800	3055680	We technically got a seasonal video out on time.
3055680	3057840	Join me in October 2022
3057840	3060400	for the release of this year's Halloween video.
3060440	3062440	♪♪
3062440	3064360	But seriously, it's Christmas.
3064360	3066840	Time for some classic Christmas honesty.
3066840	3070200	Thanks a lot to everyone who supports me doing this stuff.
3070200	3071680	Thanks so much to my patrons,
3071680	3074520	whose names should be somewhere around here right now,
3074520	3078520	for funding this ridiculous thing that I do with my life.
3078520	3080440	My patrons have been able to see this video
3080440	3081880	almost a year in advance.
3081880	3084880	I put it out when I finished it after Christmas,
3084880	3086840	so I figured they could see what I was doing.
3086840	3089400	Patrons normally get to see videos early,
3089440	3091480	but usually, like, a few days in advance,
3091480	3092640	not normally that long.
3092640	3094920	Oh, and the names go in the credits like this.
3094920	3097880	I also do bonus videos and behind-the-scenes type stuff.
3097880	3099720	I did a really high-effort video
3099720	3102920	about the graph that I made for this video,
3102920	3104560	which is probably the best video I ever made
3104560	3106480	and barely anyone's gonna see it, so that's nice.
3106480	3111080	It's been kind of amazing being able to spend all day
3111080	3114000	writing and researching videos and editing
3114000	3116960	and Googling how to make nice-looking graphs,
3116960	3119600	and for that to be my job has been kind of amazing.
3121200	3123560	I had a really bad year in 2018.
3124880	3127920	I got out of this very long depression spiral
3127920	3130400	and didn't really know what I was gonna do
3130400	3132560	with my life after that,
3132560	3134640	and I came out in early 2019 to discover
3134640	3136920	that I somehow had this audience of people
3136920	3140800	who thought what I did was good and meaningful
3140800	3143360	and friends who actually seemed to like me
3143360	3145000	as a person for once,
3145000	3149400	and as bad as things have been in the last little while,
3149400	3152720	I can't shake that feeling of just being happy to be here,
3152720	3155480	so thank you so much.
3155480	3159480	I don't think I'll ever be thankful enough, but thank you.
3161280	3163320	Well, that's the Christmas video.
3163320	3164160	I hope you liked it.
3164160	3167680	I mean, this video kind of had a weird ending, didn't it?
3167680	3169560	That slow-zoom joke is a bit niche.
3169560	3170760	I don't think many people are gonna,
3170760	3172080	no, wait, stop!
3203080	3204520	Wow, frozen much?
3204520	3207240	I know it's cold in here, but come on, guy.
3207240	3209440	Ha ha, now that's what I call-
