00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Bill Nye was once just a humble mechanical engineer turned comedian who decided to make a children's science TV show.

00:07.400 --> 00:13.800
If you were growing up in the 90s in one of the shittiest and most underfunded and creationist overrun education systems in the Western world,

00:13.800 --> 00:16.360
this man all but was your science teacher.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.640
After his show ended, he became an advocate for scientific literacy.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.560
He had many high-profile debates with both creationists and global warming deniers.

00:23.560 --> 00:30.360
But then, he suddenly became a crazy, corrupted, swish-shill.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.200
But Bill, not you!

00:32.200 --> 00:38.880
Look, I know that so many people are starting to catch this SJW virus, but I never knew that it would be my dearest Bill.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.560
He made me angry.

00:40.560 --> 00:46.640
I'm just trying to get my head around it. Maybe you can tell me. It seems as though the show had absolutely nothing to do with science.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.640
He made me very, very angry.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.880
There's only two genders. I don't need to do research.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.040
You're s- you are a representative of science. And you just shit over all of it.

01:01.040 --> 01:15.320
The world Bill Nye wishes to build seems to include rampant sexual promiscuity, dismissal of science in lieu of feelings, encouragement of sodomy.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.840
Ehuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh!

01:17.840 --> 01:20.320
Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640
Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.

01:21.640 --> 01:21.720
Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.000
Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.760
Bill Nye got a new show for Netflix, Bill Nye Saves the World,

01:26.760 --> 01:29.640
a show dedicated to furthering the work he did all those years ago,

01:29.640 --> 01:34.560
covering new topics and the changes to the old ones since that old show went off the air in 1998.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.480
And on one episode, entitled, The Sexual Spectrum, he delved into explorations of sex and gender.

01:39.480 --> 01:44.760
And if there's one thing a true man of reason would never do, it's think about that stuff at all.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.640
I mean, he might be infected by...

01:47.640 --> 01:49.400
Feminism?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.160
Who is this empowering?

01:51.160 --> 01:53.840
It's empowering ignorant women!

01:53.840 --> 01:56.680
How dare ignorant people feel empowered!

01:56.680 --> 02:01.000
We can't have that happening, said the man in the Trump hat.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.880
And as a Feminazi swidge myself, I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.200
Let's check the episode out, shall we?

02:08.200 --> 02:11.680
I, um, already saw the episode before pre-recording this.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.360
Eh.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.680
For a supposed Bill Nye's Gone to the Dogs Nightmare Freak Show,

02:15.680 --> 02:17.880
he doesn't even really say all that much, in my opinion.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.440
He does a decent baseline covering of the topic and the general state of our understanding of sex,

02:22.440 --> 02:26.920
gender, attraction, and expression, and how all these things are essentially separate spectrums from one another,

02:26.920 --> 02:30.120
but he doesn't really go enough into the science behind it, as I'd like,

02:30.120 --> 02:33.720
and he doesn't really say anything new to someone who's already read about this stuff.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.800
So, to me, it was kind of disappointing.

02:35.800 --> 02:41.040
The segment in Korea was interesting, and it's fascinating seeing a culture with different approaches to gender norms

02:41.040 --> 02:44.120
dealing with new approaches to expression in its own way.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.240
But there's also a bunch of segments that restate what was already said,

02:47.240 --> 02:50.480
or which I feel should be kind of obvious by now to most people,

02:50.480 --> 02:54.640
in such a reductionist or over-the-top way that it feels like they were trying way too hard

02:54.640 --> 02:56.080
to make the topic, quote-unquote,

02:56.080 --> 03:00.440
entertaining, when the point of Bill Nye is that science is entertaining, you know?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.480
["Science Rules!" by Bill Nye playing in the background as music plays in the background for a while.]

03:03.480 --> 03:06.600
The musical number with Rachel Bloom, whom a crazy ex-girlfriend,

03:06.600 --> 03:09.400
which might just be the funniest show of the last two years,

03:09.400 --> 03:12.080
is pretty good, but says very little,

03:12.080 --> 03:15.520
and even when watching it at the time, I knew it was the thing people would point to and go,

03:15.520 --> 03:20.720
"'How dare you! This is so silly! I clipped this bit out of context, and now it's so over-the-top!

03:20.720 --> 03:23.120
My goodness, this comedy music bit...

03:23.120 --> 03:25.360
...it... doesn't make any...

03:26.000 --> 03:28.560
...careful references to studies...

03:29.360 --> 03:30.800
...ehhhhhh.'"

03:30.800 --> 03:35.200
And there's an animated segment with ice creams that mixes its metaphors a little too much.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.360
Like, you have this vanilla ice cream, right?

03:37.360 --> 03:41.320
And he simultaneously stands for, like, oppressive religious extremism

03:41.320 --> 03:43.480
and practices like conversion therapy,

03:43.480 --> 03:46.280
but he also, like, stands for heterosexuality

03:46.280 --> 03:51.640
and people who don't accept the existence of other ones at the same time.

03:51.640 --> 03:55.560
The segment conflates physical sex, attraction, and gender expression

03:55.560 --> 03:59.000
in a way that becomes confusing and actively makes the earlier segments

03:59.000 --> 04:02.680
trying to explain the issue as simply as possible harder to understand.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.640
Then, like, they're discussing favorite flavors of ice cream

04:05.640 --> 04:07.000
when they are ice cream.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.360
Like, is this a metaphor for sex or cannibalism?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.720
Do they eat each other?

04:11.720 --> 04:14.840
Is cannibalism legal in this ice cream-based universe?

04:14.840 --> 04:16.360
How do they digest each other?

04:16.360 --> 04:17.640
Do the ice creams fuck?

04:17.640 --> 04:18.600
Why would you do this?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.840
This episode gets across a lot of simple ideas

04:20.840 --> 04:22.840
lots of people have hopefully seen and heard before,

04:22.840 --> 04:24.520
like that trans people exist,

04:24.520 --> 04:28.280
or that other physical, mental, psychological, and personality-based aspects

04:28.280 --> 04:31.240
differentiate people far more than the genitals or chromosomes

04:31.240 --> 04:32.440
they happen to be born with.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.720
The other piece of terminology I expect a lot of people to be tripped up on

04:35.720 --> 04:38.680
is the part where he brings up the concept of gender expression.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.440
The more uninformed view of concepts like masculinity and femininity

04:42.440 --> 04:44.600
is that they're linked directly to a person's gender,

04:44.600 --> 04:47.400
and along with that, their physical sex or biology,

04:47.400 --> 04:50.200
creating the expectation for prescribed roles and behaviors

04:50.200 --> 04:53.080
based on a person's sex or gender or sexual preferences.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.640
But the reality is that we see a broad range of behaviors

04:55.640 --> 04:58.040
that take place often irrespective of these things.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.040
This is something the LGBT community is far more ahead with than the mainstream.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.240
Take, for example, the concepts of butch and femme in lesbian culture.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.440
These are words used to describe the personalities of lesbian women.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.600
You can be a woman attracted to other women,

05:10.600 --> 05:14.600
but still express this very differently from other women attracted to women.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.960
Gender expression is a wider acknowledgement of this sort of behavior,

05:17.960 --> 05:20.760
and the idea that a person's personality is not something inherent

05:20.760 --> 05:24.600
to the other aspects of their physical biology, gender, or sexuality.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.800
To put it another way, I might be male, and you might be male,

05:27.800 --> 05:31.000
but regardless, we both express maleness in different ways from each other

05:31.000 --> 05:35.880
and have to define for ourselves what it means to even be male in the first place.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.640
These sides of human behavior are fascinating and still developing fields of study,

05:39.640 --> 05:43.000
and the way they're glossed over by being talked about very briefly

05:43.000 --> 05:45.880
or turning up in the form of a mint chocolate chip ice cream

05:45.880 --> 05:48.440
fails to really get these ideas across very well,

05:48.440 --> 05:51.720
either in terms of summing up a subject you might be already familiar with

05:51.720 --> 05:54.680
or in introducing it to you for the first time.

05:54.680 --> 06:00.440
It gave a rudimentary, comedically slanted description of sex, gender, identity, and expression

06:00.440 --> 06:03.320
that feels in itself a little too reductionist to be useful.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.320
It basically tells you that these things exist, which, yeah.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.320
I have my own criticisms of the show,

06:09.320 --> 06:14.040
but I expect the rational raisins and smarty-pants scar bands of the world

06:14.040 --> 06:17.880
to have their own very different problems with the show.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.160
Let's look at a few in more detail and see if their problems hold water.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.040
Here's a video by one of YouTube's most prominent skeptics,

06:24.040 --> 06:27.240
and you know he's skeptical because he put it in his name!

06:27.240 --> 06:28.760
Armored Skeptic.

06:28.760 --> 06:34.040
I'm going to be using clips from both his video and various episodes of Bill Nye's new show,

06:34.040 --> 06:36.040
so to make sure I'm not taking anything out of context,

06:36.040 --> 06:41.160
I highly recommend that you watch his video and the show for yourself first.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.640
The links are in the description and by Netflix.

06:45.640 --> 06:51.320
The first segment is a skit where his persona argues with another version of himself,

06:51.320 --> 06:52.600
voiced by himself.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.000
Mondo respect. I think the guy's onto something with that.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.360
He goes into an episode-by-episode breakdown, summing up his opinion on each.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.840
The episode that deals with sex and gender is episode 9,

07:00.840 --> 07:03.960
but I'll briefly point out some aspects of Skeptic's perspective—

07:03.960 --> 07:05.240
God, that's a tongue twister—

07:05.240 --> 07:09.240
on earlier episodes that I regard as illustrative of problems with his approach.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.440
Episode 1 was all about climate change, and this is how he talks about it.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.280
The first episode is about climate change,

07:14.280 --> 07:17.800
and I was a little apprehensive about this one because this is Bill's subject,

07:17.800 --> 07:18.840
but it was great!

07:18.840 --> 07:21.400
Bill was a little awkward in front of the live audience,

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
but that only really added to the charm.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.680
He doesn't get too political, he doesn't use too much hyperbole,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.880
he demonstrates how climate change is affecting the planet today,

07:29.880 --> 07:33.400
and even innovative ways that engineers are dealing with these problems.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.600
I even liked the panel!

07:34.600 --> 07:38.520
He had some guy on who said that he wanted the entire United States to be renewable,

07:38.520 --> 07:39.880
and another guy on the panel was like,

07:39.880 --> 07:41.080
no, that's a fantasy world.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.920
It was great, it was really well-balanced.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.720
I mean, no, he didn't have any climate change skeptics or anything,

07:45.720 --> 07:46.520
but you know what I mean.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.960
He congratulates the panel for being well-balanced.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.400
The focus is on balance, on not taking a side.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.840
So, is balance what we saw in that panel?

07:59.480 --> 08:03.800
Professor Mark Jacobson outlines that while it may sound impossible to some people,

08:03.800 --> 08:08.360
it is absolutely possible to make mankind's energy infrastructure completely renewable.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.280
The main barriers are social and political.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.960
You can see how this science professor might have to risk getting a bit political here,

08:13.960 --> 08:19.240
you know, to fix the part where we all might die if it's not taken care—

08:19.240 --> 08:20.440
you can see how it might—

08:20.440 --> 08:22.920
politics might have to come into it at some point.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.720
Meanwhile, Richard Martin, my main man Dick Mart,

08:25.720 --> 08:28.440
thinks it's utopian and unrealistic to think that,

08:28.440 --> 08:31.160
even though it's literally possible to actually do.

08:31.160 --> 08:35.240
There are many people in the world who dismiss ideas that actually could work in practice,

08:35.240 --> 08:38.040
and we know that because it's possible to check,

08:38.040 --> 08:41.080
because they've decided it's too utopian.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.800
He all but complains that there's no magic money tree.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.160
Where have we heard that before?

08:45.160 --> 08:48.200
He offers an alternative in the form of nuclear energy.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.040
Jacobs retorts that the time it would take to get the many thousands of nuclear power plants

08:52.040 --> 08:54.280
required to supplant traditional ones approved and built

08:54.280 --> 08:57.320
would fail to correct our impact on the climate in time.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.160
Dick Mart has no retort to this.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.160
He just kind of continues harping on how crazy it would be

09:03.160 --> 09:06.920
to do the thing that we statistically could do if we got our shit together.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.320
Like, bro, you're trying to convince, like, millions of Americans

09:11.320 --> 09:16.280
to allow dozens of thousands more nuclear plants into their backyard.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.680
You gotta fucking explain how it'll work.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.120
I even liked the panel.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.880
He had some guy on who said that he wanted the entire United States to be renewable,

09:23.880 --> 09:25.240
and another guy on the panel was like,

09:25.240 --> 09:26.440
no, that's a fantasy world.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.280
It was great. It was really well-balanced.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.160
According to Skeptic, the panel is one person saying,

09:31.160 --> 09:35.480
I want America to be this really wishful thinking pie-in-the-sky thing,

09:35.480 --> 09:37.960
like, to have the entire United States be renewable,

09:37.960 --> 09:41.320
and another person being more realistic and dismissing it as a fantasy,

09:41.320 --> 09:45.160
something Skeptic has primed you to believe is a fantasy because he set it up like that.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.960
It feels like he's projecting the reality of America

09:47.960 --> 09:50.920
like he's projected his ideas of the social justice warrior

09:50.920 --> 09:55.000
versus reasonable rational thinker discussion onto this subject.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.160
The problem with thinking this panel is balanced,

09:57.160 --> 09:59.160
or is supposed to try to be balanced,

09:59.160 --> 10:01.560
is that science isn't balanced.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.480
One of these guys was right.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.280
One of these guys, you can check and it's actually true.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.160
The other guy was just,

10:07.160 --> 10:10.600
ah, it's utopian, just can't do it.

10:10.600 --> 10:15.960
Let's build thousands of nuclear plants faster than we've ever done before with magic.

10:15.960 --> 10:16.840
That'll solve it.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.280
He doesn't get too political.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.480
I'm just gonna laser focus on this for a second.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.600
Skeptic appears, based on this and some comments we'll see later,

10:24.600 --> 10:29.240
to think that being rational and objective relies on not being too politically biased.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.840
But if you, for example, don't want mankind to die out,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.960
or want things to get better for people,

10:35.960 --> 10:40.200
and your focus is on finding ways to do this using science and facts and truth,

10:40.200 --> 10:43.000
then you are unavoidably going to get political.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.840
The current, though hopefully not for long,

10:44.840 --> 10:48.040
Prime Minister of my country closed a group investigating climate change,

10:48.040 --> 10:50.280
and is about to get into bed with the DUP,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.040
a group known for, among other things,

10:52.040 --> 10:55.160
thinking being gay is a sin and climate change denial,

10:55.160 --> 10:59.080
and the current head of state in the USA thinks global warming was created by the Chinese

10:59.080 --> 11:01.880
in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.640
When you say climate change is real,

11:03.640 --> 11:05.560
and people who don't think that are full of shit,

11:05.560 --> 11:07.880
you're inherently making a political statement

11:07.880 --> 11:11.080
because people in politics act based on views like this.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.280
When you say you would prefer for the climate to not drastically change

11:14.280 --> 11:16.760
in a way that would be unfortunate for the bulk of humanity,

11:16.760 --> 11:19.800
you are unavoidably making a political statement.

11:19.800 --> 11:24.440
This kind of writing implies skeptic worries this scientist is going to get too political.

11:24.440 --> 11:29.880
I worry skeptic is trying to depoliticize a scientific problem that is very political indeed.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.240
This is just me speculating,

11:31.240 --> 11:34.600
but I'm struck with the sense that upon reaching more contentious episodes

11:34.600 --> 11:36.280
based on science he's less familiar with,

11:36.280 --> 11:39.480
or which relate to pressing social and political issues of the day,

11:39.480 --> 11:42.760
skeptic was annoyed by Nye's alternative conclusions or ideas,

11:42.760 --> 11:45.800
and rather than disagreeing with them for academic reasons,

11:45.800 --> 11:48.200
he takes the view that he gets too political,

11:48.200 --> 11:51.640
and therefore the bits he does like must have been less political, right?

11:51.640 --> 11:53.400
But here's the problem with that view.

11:53.400 --> 11:57.800
— What can we, as non-scientists, as non-brilliant engineers,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.240
do trying to be a realist?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.040
— VOTE!

12:00.040 --> 12:00.540
— Yes.

12:00.540 --> 12:01.040
— Yes.

12:01.040 --> 12:01.540
— Yes.

12:01.540 --> 12:02.040
— Yes.

12:02.040 --> 12:02.540
— Yes.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.040
— Yes.

12:03.040 --> 12:03.540
— Yes.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.040
— Yes.

12:04.040 --> 12:04.540
— Yes.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.040
— Yes.

12:05.040 --> 12:05.540
— Yes.

12:05.540 --> 12:06.040
— Yes.

12:06.040 --> 12:06.540
— Yes.

12:06.540 --> 12:07.040
— Yes.

12:07.040 --> 12:07.540
— Yes.

12:07.540 --> 12:08.040
— Yes.

12:08.040 --> 12:08.540
— Yes.

12:08.540 --> 12:09.040
— Yes.

12:09.040 --> 12:09.540
— Yes.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.040
— Yes.

12:10.040 --> 12:10.540
— Yes.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.040
— Yes.

12:11.040 --> 12:11.540
— Yes.

12:11.540 --> 12:12.040
— Yes.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.960
— Participate. Go ahead.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.600
He communicates that the episode isn't too political

12:16.600 --> 12:19.800
when Bill Nye overtly asks the audience to vote,

12:19.800 --> 12:24.200
which maybe would suggest not voting for people who think the entire issue is fake.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.240
He's being positive about this episode to gear you up for when he

12:27.240 --> 12:30.440
gets political later by saying things he didn't already agree with,

12:30.440 --> 12:33.720
so he compliments the parts of the show he happens to agree with for

12:33.720 --> 12:35.240
not being too political.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.440
But Nye literally told you to vote based on the science.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.800
I would argue that the section of the show where Nye desperately shouts

12:41.800 --> 12:46.120
vote directly into the camera lens is one of the most overtly political things

12:46.120 --> 12:47.720
he does in the entire show.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.600
I'm willing to bet a climate change denier would criticize this episode

12:50.600 --> 12:52.280
for being way too political.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.640
The place where I disagree with Skeptic and my purely theoretical,

12:55.640 --> 12:59.400
incredibly stupid climate change denier who bears no relation to Stephen Crowder

12:59.400 --> 13:03.000
is that I think these problems inevitably have political implications

13:03.000 --> 13:05.560
and exploring them is intellectually honest

13:05.560 --> 13:08.200
and necessary for effecting positive change.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.240
By pretending this isn't the case, Skeptic is setting himself up

13:11.240 --> 13:15.160
for the parts he doesn't like being bad simply by nature of being political.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.880
This episode is very clearly politically driven.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.600
When he talks about episode two, he complains about the segment

13:20.600 --> 13:23.960
where Prashant criticizes the use of Asian mysticism imagery

13:23.960 --> 13:26.680
in Quack Healing to try and boost its cred,

13:26.680 --> 13:28.920
and he talks about it like this.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.200
A man named Prashant gets up on the stage

13:32.200 --> 13:34.840
almost as if he was going to perform a stand-up routine,

13:34.840 --> 13:39.480
but instead of making me laugh, he made me angry.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.120
He made me very, very angry.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.440
Prashant's lectured the entire white race

13:48.440 --> 13:51.640
on how it's unacceptable to use Asian mysticism

13:51.640 --> 13:53.560
because it's from a different culture.

13:53.560 --> 13:53.960
What?

13:54.760 --> 13:55.400
Listen, listen.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.160
I know that it's tempting to do this.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.840
I know how so many people think that they've figured out the formula,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.200
but this needs to end.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.880
If you think that you're that one person in the entire universe

14:05.880 --> 14:10.200
who's figured out a way to talk down to an entire race of people

14:10.200 --> 14:15.240
and lecture them on how to behave without coming across as a racist asshole,

14:16.120 --> 14:16.920
stop.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.360
Because you haven't figured it out.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.320
It's impossible.

14:19.320 --> 14:19.960
Get this, though.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.920
Prashant says that he doesn't believe in Asian mysticism,

14:22.920 --> 14:25.320
and he says that he doesn't like Asian mysticism.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.800
In fact, he says that he hates it.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.320
So why does it even matter?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.680
Who does it, then?

14:30.680 --> 14:34.360
You're trying to hog a part of your culture that you hate all to yourself?

14:34.360 --> 14:35.400
It doesn't even make any sense.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.480
What the fuck does that have to do with science?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.560
What does this have to do with saving the world?

14:39.560 --> 14:40.520
What even is this?

14:40.520 --> 14:44.840
Why the fuck is somebody talking about the white race on the Bill Nye show?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.760
After this, I'm pissed.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.440
I'm trying to watch the third episode,

14:48.440 --> 14:51.400
but my blood is boiling.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.840
Okay, this segment is actually fascinating in numerous ways

14:54.840 --> 14:58.120
and almost makes me question Skeptic's intellectual honesty

14:58.120 --> 15:00.920
in regards to accurately presenting the content of the show.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.240
It contains numerous falsehoods and omissions.

15:03.240 --> 15:07.720
The first false assertion is that this segment is about how Prashant was mad at white people

15:07.720 --> 15:10.280
for appropriating a culture that wasn't theirs.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.960
Prashant's lectured the entire white race

15:13.960 --> 15:17.160
on how it's unacceptable to use Asian mysticism

15:17.160 --> 15:18.680
because it's from a different culture.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.480
I don't want to do this to Skeptic,

15:21.480 --> 15:23.320
but that's just not true.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.240
That isn't what happened here.

15:25.240 --> 15:29.640
Skeptic is attempting to accuse him of arguing about cultural appropriation,

15:29.640 --> 15:32.200
but he's actually talking about the well-known problem

15:32.200 --> 15:36.360
of quacks attempting to hide pseudoscience behind Asian mysticism.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.520
So you say it's magic and that it cures gout

15:38.520 --> 15:40.440
and for good measure you throw in a Ganesh statue

15:40.440 --> 15:42.440
just to give it this ancient wisdom-y feel.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.880
Prashant even name drops an infamous example

15:45.880 --> 15:47.960
who is himself of Asian descent,

15:47.960 --> 15:51.320
so he's definitely not talking about appropriation.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.160
It's actually the oldest trick in the book.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.600
Half nonsense, half Indian.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.800
It's called the Deepak Chopra.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.280
Why the fuck is somebody talking about the white race on the Bill Nye show?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.440
It seems like Skeptic heard Prashant say,

16:04.440 --> 16:05.480
hey, white people,

16:05.480 --> 16:07.160
and then he, like, turned his brain off

16:07.160 --> 16:10.840
and didn't, like, didn't see this bit?

16:11.560 --> 16:14.360
Like, I'm genuinely curious if he remembers this part.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.840
The second false assertion is that this is a lecture,

16:16.840 --> 16:18.760
a man talking down to a group of people

16:18.760 --> 16:22.600
in some kind of mad antagonistic puritanical screed.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.480
This inaccurately represents the tone of the segment.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.880
Let's play back one of the brief clips Skeptic uses of this part on mute,

16:29.880 --> 16:31.880
but with the sound on this time.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.880
White people, I love you,

16:33.880 --> 16:36.760
but stop using Asian wallpaper for street cred.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.280
I see what you're doing.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.920
This segment is a stand-up comedy routine.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.200
The man performing this skit is a stand-up comedian.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.520
Part of the joke is the hyperbolic way

16:46.520 --> 16:49.240
he's talking down to entire races of people.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.160
That's right, races.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.640
Which is why I want to say something to my fellow Asians.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.800
Asians, lend me your ears.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.120
Stop convincing white people it is real.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.360
This is as much on you as it is on them.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.960
You know how gullible they are.

17:03.240 --> 17:06.120
Prashanth is being superlative for comedic effect

17:06.120 --> 17:08.360
to get across a quite genuine idea,

17:08.360 --> 17:10.280
and the audience is laughing along with it.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.440
This isn't a lecture in the slightest.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.440
The third false assertion is this one.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.760
And he says that he doesn't like Asian miscism.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.160
In fact, he says that he hates it.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.880
Prashanth never says anything like this.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.640
He doesn't hate Asian culture.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.720
He hates it being used to sell remedies

17:25.720 --> 17:28.680
with no basis in science, regardless of race.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.000
Asians, stop selling unregulated remedies

17:31.000 --> 17:32.440
with no scientific basis,

17:32.440 --> 17:34.600
and white people, stop using Asian culture

17:34.600 --> 17:37.640
to sell unregulated remedies with no scientific proof.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.040
Look, I get that cultural appropriation

17:40.040 --> 17:41.400
and how it's not a problem

17:41.400 --> 17:44.200
is a popular talking point in the skeptic community,

17:44.200 --> 17:45.800
but that doesn't necessarily mean

17:45.800 --> 17:48.440
everyone is always talking about appropriation,

17:48.440 --> 17:50.120
and treating this segment like one

17:50.120 --> 17:51.960
has caused Skeptic to miss out on a point

17:51.960 --> 17:55.000
that I'm actually, like, 99% sure he agrees with.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.200
These assertions are wrong,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.360
but, you know, people make mistakes

17:58.360 --> 18:00.600
and have biases that impact how they view things.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.080
That's okay. I do that, too, all the time.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.080
But where it gets kind of shady

18:05.080 --> 18:06.280
is when you stop and realize

18:06.280 --> 18:09.000
how this video is seemingly constructed on purpose

18:09.000 --> 18:10.840
to make sure someone watching this review

18:10.840 --> 18:12.600
without having seen the show

18:12.600 --> 18:14.440
wouldn't possibly be able to notice

18:14.440 --> 18:15.800
these claims are false.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.360
I'm gonna think like a video editor for a second here.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.360
When Skeptic was making this video,

18:20.360 --> 18:22.760
he had this episode of the show open in his timeline

18:22.760 --> 18:23.800
and he was scrubbing through it

18:23.800 --> 18:25.000
to look for bits of the show

18:25.000 --> 18:26.200
to put in his video

18:26.200 --> 18:28.600
to demonstrate problems or events he's describing.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.240
Prashanth makes his hyperbolic jokes

18:31.240 --> 18:32.360
and people laugh,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.920
and then he talks about a genuine manipulative tactic

18:34.920 --> 18:36.840
used by pseudoscientific quacks.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.520
When Skeptic talks about this section

18:38.520 --> 18:39.800
and how racist it was

18:39.800 --> 18:41.160
and how angry it made him,

18:41.160 --> 18:42.760
he shows only this brief clip

18:42.760 --> 18:45.000
with the show's closed captions turned on.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.720
He uses the section most easily interpretable

18:47.720 --> 18:50.760
to make this section be what he thinks it's about,

18:50.760 --> 18:53.480
namely an Asian man racisting at white people,

18:53.480 --> 18:55.240
and the clip doesn't continue long enough

18:55.240 --> 18:57.160
to get to the actual meat of his real,

18:57.160 --> 18:59.240
though comedically slanted, argument.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.160
Also, I think this is accidental.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.040
There's another subtly manipulative thing happening here.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.160
You see, in some segments,

19:05.160 --> 19:07.640
Skeptic uses clips from the episode with the sound on

19:07.640 --> 19:10.280
so he can show them saying the thing and respond to it.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.000
This would be one of the prime sections to do it, right?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.240
Like, he spends a good portion of this video

19:15.240 --> 19:16.520
harping on this segment.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.320
He talks about this bit of this episode

19:19.320 --> 19:22.840
more than he does for several entire episodes collectively.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.440
It would make sense to show the clip of him saying this

19:26.440 --> 19:27.800
and let us hear it,

19:27.800 --> 19:28.760
but if he did that...

19:28.760 --> 19:31.000
I see what you're doing.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.840
...you'd hear people laughing.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.800
And no, Prashanth was ultimately making a joke,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.320
and this wouldn't jibe well

19:37.320 --> 19:39.640
with Skeptic's view that this was some kind of

19:39.640 --> 19:42.680
serious racist lecture at white people.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.720
Similarly, when he claims Prashanth says he hates Asian culture,

19:45.720 --> 19:47.640
it would have really supported his argument

19:47.640 --> 19:49.880
to show the clip of him, you know, saying that

19:49.880 --> 19:51.880
or put it in the background while he talked,

19:51.880 --> 19:53.480
but he didn't use that clip

19:53.480 --> 19:55.560
because that clip doesn't exist.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.720
If he'd used a clip of Prashanth saying

19:57.720 --> 20:00.440
he hates when Asian culture is used to take people's money

20:00.440 --> 20:03.320
and sell forms of treatment or medicine that don't work,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.280
that would make him look like he was saying that, wouldn't it?

20:06.280 --> 20:07.560
So he couldn't use that.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.160
I'd also like to go back and point out

20:09.160 --> 20:11.480
that he doesn't use any supplemental footage

20:11.480 --> 20:13.560
of the panel he talked about in episode one.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.200
I think if it had happened the way he thought it did,

20:16.200 --> 20:17.960
he would have had footage to call on here,

20:17.960 --> 20:21.000
but instead, its absence is rendered palpable.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.920
I don't think this is purposeful dishonesty.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.920
I think Skeptic had simply already arrived

20:24.920 --> 20:26.840
at his conclusions when he'd written his script,

20:26.840 --> 20:28.680
and when he was editing the video together,

20:28.680 --> 20:31.160
he just didn't notice the show isn't really saying

20:31.160 --> 20:32.600
what he thought it was saying.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.600
If you don't notice someone saying something

20:34.600 --> 20:36.280
you would probably agree with

20:36.280 --> 20:38.040
because of a little joke they made,

20:38.040 --> 20:39.640
it makes this video end up saying

20:39.640 --> 20:42.680
more about Skeptic's personal approach to watching media

20:42.680 --> 20:43.880
than the show itself,

20:43.880 --> 20:45.880
which I don't think is what he was going for.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.320
This is, to put it simply,

20:47.320 --> 20:49.880
political and ideological bias in action,

20:49.880 --> 20:52.760
and I think this is why Skeptic didn't enjoy the show.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.680
He even dismisses Prashant's segment

20:54.680 --> 20:57.720
as if it looked like it was going to be stand-up but wasn't.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.360
Now, Prashant is literally a comedian.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.720
I could make a defense of his act.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.720
You know, comedians like to push at boundaries,

21:03.720 --> 21:05.480
and that includes racial ones,

21:05.480 --> 21:08.520
point out that it's important to defend their right to do that,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.280
and also alleged mischaracterizing

21:10.280 --> 21:11.800
of people's racially charged jokes

21:11.800 --> 21:14.680
is something he himself has railed against in the past,

21:14.680 --> 21:15.960
but I'm not going to do that here

21:15.960 --> 21:18.120
because it's time to talk about the actual episode

21:18.120 --> 21:19.400
this whole video is about,

21:19.400 --> 21:22.840
which Skeptic addresses for most of the second half of this video.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.640
Bill uses the term cis male.

21:25.640 --> 21:32.200
Who better to talk about sex than two cis male white guys?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.320
Cringe.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.120
This part of the video strikes me as really odd.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.040
Skeptic implies quite overtly

21:38.040 --> 21:41.240
that using words like cis is inherently a bad thing,

21:41.240 --> 21:43.640
but it's the counterpart prefix to trans

21:43.640 --> 21:46.600
and a very useful term when discussing these ideas.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.440
Unless, of course, he's not trying to imply

21:48.440 --> 21:50.600
that using the term cis is inherently bad.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.520
Maybe he just disagrees with the nomenclature.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.120
I mean, many writers in this field

21:54.120 --> 21:56.200
do prefer terms like non-trans

21:56.200 --> 21:58.760
as a way of making the subject easier to understand,

21:58.760 --> 22:01.560
but he doesn't elaborate further than saying cringe,

22:01.560 --> 22:05.080
so all I have to go on is Skeptic saying Bill Nye said a word,

22:05.080 --> 22:06.760
and it made him feel weird.

22:06.760 --> 22:11.400
Bill explains that there is no way to gender a brain by examining it,

22:11.400 --> 22:14.040
and then explains that just like biology,

22:14.040 --> 22:15.800
gender is also on a spectrum.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.560
Bill does not take this opportunity

22:17.560 --> 22:20.200
to discuss the connection between biology and gender.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.280
Instead, he just explains the spectrum

22:22.280 --> 22:25.480
as if there is no correlation between sex and gender.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.080
I found this a little disappointing

22:27.080 --> 22:30.520
because I wanted to know what scientists know about gender identity,

22:30.520 --> 22:32.680
but instead Bill just shrugs and moves on.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.200
Listen, Greg, you know,

22:34.200 --> 22:36.680
if you wanted to know what the scientists think about this,

22:36.840 --> 22:39.240
you didn't have to wait until Bill Nye got a new show

22:39.240 --> 22:41.480
like 20 years later to find out.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.280
You can just, like, check.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.280
You can look it up.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.880
Bill Nye is not the only source for what the scientists think about this.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.240
The previous episodes of the show,

22:51.240 --> 22:52.920
which he had less of a problem with,

22:52.920 --> 22:55.880
also don't cite the evidence in the precise way

22:55.880 --> 22:57.960
that he seems to expect specifically

22:57.960 --> 23:01.000
when it's on a topic that he doesn't agree with or know much about.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.240
Nye doesn't bring up the specifics of forcing,

23:03.240 --> 23:04.680
or the ice sheets,

23:04.680 --> 23:07.880
or planetary albedo in the climate change video,

23:07.880 --> 23:09.240
but that doesn't mean you should just assume

23:09.240 --> 23:11.000
there is no science and it doesn't exist,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.920
unless, of course, you're Steven Crowder.

23:12.920 --> 23:16.120
The show is simply trying to find a way to explain these topics

23:16.120 --> 23:19.400
to a general audience in a way that's not too complicated,

23:19.400 --> 23:21.320
and that's all right.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.440
Bill calls the fourth one expression.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.560
It's the way people express their gender.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.520
Bill, um, uh, Bill,

23:30.600 --> 23:35.720
what's the difference between gender and gender expression?

23:35.720 --> 23:37.800
What even is gender expression?

23:37.800 --> 23:39.480
A good portion of this section of the video

23:39.480 --> 23:41.480
is Skeptic incredulously asking questions

23:41.480 --> 23:43.960
he could literally look up in a matter of seconds.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.600
What is gender expression?

23:46.600 --> 23:48.040
How does it relate to gender?

23:48.040 --> 23:50.520
Is there a correlation with biology?

23:50.520 --> 23:54.600
Like, what percentage of the population expresses?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.680
There's a little secret with gender expression.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.060
It's...

23:58.520 --> 23:59.320
It's made up.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.480
It's fashion.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.840
It's fucking fashion.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.720
It's fashion.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.560
Now, maybe it's wrong to hold Skeptic

24:09.560 --> 24:12.040
to the same standards he holds Bill Nye to.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.840
I mean, Bill Nye is working on a fully produced show

24:14.840 --> 24:18.280
with a team of writers and researchers and, yes, comedians,

24:18.840 --> 24:21.480
but, well, Skeptic doesn't explain either

24:21.480 --> 24:23.960
what the scientists think or why they think this

24:23.960 --> 24:27.400
or what the science is to support this conclusion he makes.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.120
He doesn't cite any sources to support this himself.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.000
He complains Bill Nye isn't being scientific enough

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
and then in the next few sentences

24:35.000 --> 24:37.800
leaps directly into an unsupported conclusion.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.600
He even, and this is the interesting part I wanted to get to,

24:40.600 --> 24:41.960
makes this comment.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.000
There aren't even any statistics or studies

24:45.000 --> 24:48.520
or psychological papers or polls or anything.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.720
Okay, here we are.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.840
The brass ring.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.080
This is what we in the tennis commentating business

24:53.080 --> 24:54.920
call an unforced error.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.480
Wait, no, that's—that's golf.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.040
You see, when he dismisses this as fashion,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.640
there's some ambiguity there.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.800
If he just said that, you could interpret this

25:03.800 --> 25:06.280
as him saying he's done some research into the topic

25:06.280 --> 25:08.360
and come to the conclusion based on his reading

25:08.360 --> 25:10.760
that gender expression is a useless term.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.760
You'd wonder what he'd read and how he came to that conclusion,

25:14.760 --> 25:16.840
but you'd at least be able to credibly assume

25:16.840 --> 25:19.800
he'd looked at the academic writing on the subject at some point.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.560
But then he directly says,

25:21.560 --> 25:25.000
No research has been done and no papers have been written.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.040
And then, to make sure you know that's what he meant,

25:28.040 --> 25:29.160
he says it again.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.600
Bill says science is the process we use to understand nature,

25:32.600 --> 25:36.520
but there is no science about gender expression, Bill.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.920
That was just fucking nonsense.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.360
So I'm beginning to see why Skeptic had a problem with this episode.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.240
This episode would be really bad

25:45.240 --> 25:48.680
if it was based in absolutely no science, wouldn't it?

25:48.680 --> 25:51.640
Unfortunately, if you think that,

25:51.640 --> 25:53.400
I have some bad news for you.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.720
You might be wondering what these weird words

25:55.720 --> 25:58.760
and names and texts scrolling past the screen are right now.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.440
These are just a short list of peer-reviewed papers and studies

26:02.440 --> 26:04.280
specifically into gender expression

26:04.280 --> 26:07.880
and the nature of its relation with gender identity and biology.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.200
And believe me, this is a short list.

26:10.200 --> 26:14.040
You can find a much longer list by looking for the studies.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.080
So now, you and I know that there are studies into this.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.240
But Skeptic seemingly doesn't.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.280
He openly, directly denies they exist.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.280
How do you explain this discrepancy?

26:24.280 --> 26:26.840
Now, the cynical conclusion, the one I doubt,

26:26.840 --> 26:28.920
is that he doesn't care about the truth, really,

26:28.920 --> 26:32.120
and he thinks his audience is stupid enough to not check for themselves,

26:32.120 --> 26:34.920
and they'll just nod in agreement with a statement

26:34.920 --> 26:37.480
that confirms their own unresearched beliefs.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.640
But I think the alternative is more likely.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.680
Skeptic assumed there hadn't been any research,

26:42.680 --> 26:44.520
and it didn't occur to him to check.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.960
This is a pretty big error.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.640
Like, it's very quick to check,

26:47.640 --> 26:50.840
and the studies that result from checking are very informative and interesting

26:50.840 --> 26:53.480
and challenge the idea that gender expression is made up

26:53.480 --> 26:56.120
and equivalent to just trying to be fashionable.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.800
Even if these studies are flawed,

26:57.800 --> 27:01.960
or Skeptic could offer an alternative reading that justifies the idea it's fashion,

27:01.960 --> 27:03.880
he doesn't provide that analysis here.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.480
And also, he can't, because he doesn't seem to know they exist,

27:07.480 --> 27:11.960
which is kind of a problem when they do.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.160
Now, this is where I was hoping to get into the meat of the video, right?

27:15.160 --> 27:18.920
Like, discuss interpretations and conclusions of studies and data,

27:18.920 --> 27:20.600
but we got all the way here,

27:20.600 --> 27:23.080
and it turns out that you, the viewing audience,

27:23.080 --> 27:27.320
are going to be denied the money shot of raw, hardcore data analysis,

27:27.320 --> 27:31.560
because GargleSeptic has no data supporting his argument to analyze.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.800
He has no criticism of the existing studies,

27:33.800 --> 27:35.400
which exist, for me to debunk,

27:35.400 --> 27:38.120
and, in fact, he denies the existence of those studies.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.240
So, even pointing out that, yes, studies exist,

27:41.240 --> 27:43.480
the most rudimentary point possible,

27:43.480 --> 27:47.800
is enough to completely dash his entire argument against the rocks of reality.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.160
All his claims about gender expression, that it's all just fashion, etc.,

27:51.160 --> 27:55.960
are predicated on the non-existence of scientific examinations that actually do exist.

27:55.960 --> 28:00.360
Even if those studies themselves proved that it was all just fashion and fake,

28:00.360 --> 28:01.640
how would he know?

28:01.640 --> 28:03.640
He simply hasn't checked.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.280
Maybe he has an epistemological problem with those studies,

28:06.280 --> 28:09.560
but, to find that out, he would have to check they exist,

28:09.560 --> 28:12.920
and see they exist, and read them, and talk about them,

28:12.920 --> 28:14.840
and he's done none of those things.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.240
That's not the application of reason at all.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.160
Checking to see if studies into this exist

28:19.160 --> 28:21.800
takes literally as long as it takes a Google search to resolve,

28:21.800 --> 28:24.440
which, in my case, was 0.6 seconds.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.000
That's the quickest debunking I've ever had to do.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.640
There's two very clear reasoning problems here.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.760
The first is that, without any significant explanation that this is the case,

28:32.760 --> 28:35.480
Skeptic situates, it's fake and all just fashion,

28:35.480 --> 28:38.280
as the null hypothesis for gender expression.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.120
He makes this the natural baseline

28:40.120 --> 28:43.000
from which all other conclusions must prove their case,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.600
but his, of course, doesn't have to,

28:44.600 --> 28:46.840
because he's decided it's the default state.

28:46.840 --> 28:51.400
This conveniently frees him from having to prove his assertions without any evidence.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.840
This is just the way things are,

28:52.840 --> 28:54.680
and if Bill Nye doesn't prove otherwise,

28:54.680 --> 28:56.600
or I can't find any studies showing otherwise

28:56.600 --> 28:58.520
because I can't find them or didn't look for them,

28:58.520 --> 28:59.800
then I have to be right,

28:59.800 --> 29:01.240
and I don't even have to prove it.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.800
This is the exact sort of shifting of the burden of proof

29:03.800 --> 29:06.440
the atheist Skeptic circle will be highly familiar with

29:06.440 --> 29:09.160
if they've ever encountered a presuppositionalist theist.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.640
Someone whose central arguments amounted to insisting

29:11.640 --> 29:14.840
that God's existence is how one should naturally assume the world is,

29:14.840 --> 29:17.720
and it's up to disbelievers to prove God doesn't exist,

29:17.720 --> 29:20.600
meaning they could dismiss people merely skeptical of positive proof

29:20.600 --> 29:23.880
without having to ever bother paying attention to what they have to say.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.680
Combine this with a disastrous inability or unwillingness

29:26.680 --> 29:28.920
to understand science or how evidence works,

29:28.920 --> 29:30.840
and they've built themselves a perfect box

29:30.840 --> 29:33.320
from which they'll never have to even think about leaving.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.280
Skeptic would doubtless see this flawed logic in an instant

29:36.280 --> 29:39.480
if he ever saw Syten, Brugge, and Cate making this kind of argument,

29:39.480 --> 29:41.560
but substitute the existence of God

29:41.560 --> 29:43.880
for the non-existence of gender expression,

29:43.880 --> 29:46.040
and here he is making that argument.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.000
Bill says,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.240
We need to go with the science,

29:49.240 --> 29:52.680
and the science says we're all on a spectrum.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.040
Um...

29:54.040 --> 29:55.240
No.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.240
Um...

29:59.240 --> 30:00.920
Yes!

30:00.920 --> 30:01.960
It's a trend.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.360
It's trendy for boys to wear makeup.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.920
It's trendy for girls to wear bowties.

30:06.920 --> 30:07.640
That's it.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.760
Don't push it, Greg.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.800
You know for a fact that bowties make anyone sexier,

30:11.800 --> 30:13.960
regardless of gender identity.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.840
Speaking of which, this bowtie was actually made for me by my mother.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.520
I wore this to a wedding.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.880
I was gonna put a joke here,

30:19.880 --> 30:22.280
but I just like this bowtie. It's really nice.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.400
Thanks, Mom.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.600
Then they proceed to give in to their urges

30:26.600 --> 30:30.360
and start licking each other like a bunch of fucking sluts.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.360
You know, I didn't like this segment either,

30:32.360 --> 30:36.200
but I wouldn't personally have slut-shamed the ice cream.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.600
Sorry.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.400
Sorry.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.560
I just realized the words that I said.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.080
I mean, maybe I have it all wrong.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.760
Maybe it was just played for laughs.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.800
You know, like, maybe this is intentionally absurdist.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.320
Really?

30:49.320 --> 30:51.240
What gave it away, Greg?

30:51.240 --> 30:55.320
What part of the comedy cartoon ice cream licking party

30:55.320 --> 30:57.320
came across to you as absurd?

30:57.320 --> 31:04.760
...

31:04.760 --> 31:06.840
Bill then uses mannequins to demonstrate

31:06.840 --> 31:09.640
that sex and gender are not really set in stone,

31:09.640 --> 31:11.880
biology isn't always clear-cut,

31:11.880 --> 31:14.040
and that the whole thing is relative.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.720
Okay, I'm fine with that.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.360
If this was Bill's intended message,

31:18.360 --> 31:20.600
then I have to commend Bill for saying this.

31:20.600 --> 31:25.320
Tolerance of people who don't fit social and biological norms is important.

31:25.320 --> 31:29.400
We don't have to try to understand or relate to LGBT people,

31:29.400 --> 31:32.280
but we can at least treat them like human beings.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.720
Even if you are what they call a trans-trender,

31:35.720 --> 31:36.360
I don't care.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.520
Be whatever flavor of ice cream you want to be.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.040
The message of tolerance is a good one,

31:40.040 --> 31:41.480
and I fully agree with that part.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.240
I've interrogated some of his arguments

31:43.240 --> 31:46.600
and laughed at his weird comments about the slutty ice creams,

31:46.600 --> 31:49.320
but I think it's really important that I leave this bit in here.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.160
A good portion of my response today has been about

31:51.160 --> 31:54.600
the often accidental duplicitousness of video editing,

31:54.680 --> 31:57.080
and I feel like not putting this segment in here

31:57.640 --> 31:59.800
would imply that he doesn't say stuff like that,

31:59.800 --> 32:01.160
and I couldn't abide doing that,

32:01.160 --> 32:02.520
so I thought I'd leave it in here.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.680
He puts this in here specifically because

32:04.680 --> 32:06.280
he knows there are people out there

32:06.280 --> 32:08.520
who think that trans and non-binary people

32:08.520 --> 32:10.760
don't have a right to exist,

32:10.760 --> 32:12.280
or in fact don't exist at all,

32:12.280 --> 32:16.360
and it's all just mentally ill people or trenders who are pretending,

32:16.360 --> 32:18.840
and it's important to take a stance against

32:18.840 --> 32:21.400
people being ridiculously shitty like that,

32:21.400 --> 32:25.480
even if the science didn't shake out in favor of their existence,

32:25.480 --> 32:26.760
which it does.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.040
The problem with Skeptic's video

32:28.040 --> 32:30.200
has nothing to do with any explicit bigotry.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.200
It's more to do with how he grasps the science

32:32.200 --> 32:34.280
and how he approached the show itself,

32:34.280 --> 32:36.520
and for a person who calls themselves a skeptic,

32:37.080 --> 32:39.480
not being willing to check if they're wrong

32:39.480 --> 32:40.920
by looking up the science

32:40.920 --> 32:42.360
constitutes something of a problem

32:42.360 --> 32:44.040
that I think is worth talking about.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.840
While I have very often and repeatedly satirized

32:46.840 --> 32:50.760
the language and implied values of the so-called skeptic community,

32:50.760 --> 32:55.240
I do actually also believe that skepticism and reason

32:55.240 --> 32:57.480
and facts and logic and evidence

32:57.480 --> 32:59.880
and all those other buzzwords are actually important.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.720
They do mean something,

33:01.720 --> 33:03.320
and they are worth thinking about.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.120
Greg doesn't seem like a bad person to me.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.640
You know, I make these videos,

33:07.640 --> 33:09.400
and sometimes I'm really mocking of people,

33:09.400 --> 33:11.480
either to be over-the-top because I think it's funny,

33:11.480 --> 33:13.320
or because I know their minds won't be changed

33:13.320 --> 33:15.640
because they're just so far out there.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.200
I'm curious, now that I've definitively made him aware

33:18.200 --> 33:19.240
that the subjects exist,

33:19.240 --> 33:20.840
if he does watch this video,

33:20.840 --> 33:23.880
if skeptic will change his mind in accordance with the evidence,

33:23.880 --> 33:26.280
or at least develop a new perspective on the issues

33:26.280 --> 33:28.200
based on the stuff that I've pointed out.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.800
I think this is actually the first time I've genuinely thought,

33:32.360 --> 33:34.040
maybe some progress is going to happen here.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.640
Maybe someone's going to watch this and go,

33:35.640 --> 33:37.640
oh man, there is science and I missed it.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.160
That would be really interesting, wouldn't it?

33:39.160 --> 33:42.440
Although honestly, given the speed that discourse moves that on the internet,

33:42.440 --> 33:45.000
maybe he's already developed his opinion further.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.600
I don't have the time to watch all of everyone's videos nowadays

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
because I'm so busy making my own stuff,

33:50.600 --> 33:54.040
or, you know, reading the studies.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.280
♪ Science rules! ♪

33:56.280 --> 33:58.840
Speaking of time, I did not intend for this video to get this long.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.560
I was going to cover a whole bunch of people in this video,

34:01.560 --> 34:04.040
and I ended up getting sidetracked completely by just one.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.320
Gosh, I've got to be at the airport in like...

34:08.520 --> 34:09.640
12 MINUTES?!

34:13.640 --> 34:15.560
I've got to go! We'll cover the rest next time!

34:16.200 --> 34:17.880
God! Shit! Fuck!

34:18.840 --> 34:19.800
Jesus! Fuck!

34:19.800 --> 34:22.360
Where's the- where's the fucking briefcase?!

34:22.360 --> 34:23.400
Oh, shit!
