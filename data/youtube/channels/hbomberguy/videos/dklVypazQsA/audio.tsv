0	7400	Bill Nye was once just a humble mechanical engineer turned comedian who decided to make a children's science TV show.
7400	13800	If you were growing up in the 90s in one of the shittiest and most underfunded and creationist overrun education systems in the Western world,
13800	16360	this man all but was your science teacher.
16360	19640	After his show ended, he became an advocate for scientific literacy.
19640	23560	He had many high-profile debates with both creationists and global warming deniers.
23560	30360	But then, he suddenly became a crazy, corrupted, swish-shill.
30360	32200	But Bill, not you!
32200	38880	Look, I know that so many people are starting to catch this SJW virus, but I never knew that it would be my dearest Bill.
38880	40560	He made me angry.
40560	46640	I'm just trying to get my head around it. Maybe you can tell me. It seems as though the show had absolutely nothing to do with science.
46640	50640	He made me very, very angry.
50760	55880	There's only two genders. I don't need to do research.
55880	61040	You're s- you are a representative of science. And you just shit over all of it.
61040	75320	The world Bill Nye wishes to build seems to include rampant sexual promiscuity, dismissal of science in lieu of feelings, encouragement of sodomy.
75320	77840	Ehuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh!
77840	80320	Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.
80640	81640	Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.
81640	81720	Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.
81720	83000	Ahem. Alright, I think I went a little overboard on that.
83840	86760	Bill Nye got a new show for Netflix, Bill Nye Saves the World,
86760	89640	a show dedicated to furthering the work he did all those years ago,
89640	94560	covering new topics and the changes to the old ones since that old show went off the air in 1998.
94560	99480	And on one episode, entitled, The Sexual Spectrum, he delved into explorations of sex and gender.
99480	104760	And if there's one thing a true man of reason would never do, it's think about that stuff at all.
104760	107640	I mean, he might be infected by...
107640	109400	Feminism?
109400	111160	Who is this empowering?
111160	113840	It's empowering ignorant women!
113840	116680	How dare ignorant people feel empowered!
116680	121000	We can't have that happening, said the man in the Trump hat.
121000	125880	And as a Feminazi swidge myself, I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about.
125880	128200	Let's check the episode out, shall we?
128200	131680	I, um, already saw the episode before pre-recording this.
131680	132360	Eh.
132360	135680	For a supposed Bill Nye's Gone to the Dogs Nightmare Freak Show,
135680	137880	he doesn't even really say all that much, in my opinion.
137880	142440	He does a decent baseline covering of the topic and the general state of our understanding of sex,
142440	146920	gender, attraction, and expression, and how all these things are essentially separate spectrums from one another,
146920	150120	but he doesn't really go enough into the science behind it, as I'd like,
150120	153720	and he doesn't really say anything new to someone who's already read about this stuff.
153720	155800	So, to me, it was kind of disappointing.
155800	161040	The segment in Korea was interesting, and it's fascinating seeing a culture with different approaches to gender norms
161040	164120	dealing with new approaches to expression in its own way.
164120	167240	But there's also a bunch of segments that restate what was already said,
167240	170480	or which I feel should be kind of obvious by now to most people,
170480	174640	in such a reductionist or over-the-top way that it feels like they were trying way too hard
174640	176080	to make the topic, quote-unquote,
176080	180440	entertaining, when the point of Bill Nye is that science is entertaining, you know?
180440	183480	["Science Rules!" by Bill Nye playing in the background as music plays in the background for a while.]
183480	186600	The musical number with Rachel Bloom, whom a crazy ex-girlfriend,
186600	189400	which might just be the funniest show of the last two years,
189400	192080	is pretty good, but says very little,
192080	195520	and even when watching it at the time, I knew it was the thing people would point to and go,
195520	200720	"'How dare you! This is so silly! I clipped this bit out of context, and now it's so over-the-top!
200720	203120	My goodness, this comedy music bit...
203120	205360	...it... doesn't make any...
206000	208560	...careful references to studies...
209360	210800	...ehhhhhh.'"
210800	215200	And there's an animated segment with ice creams that mixes its metaphors a little too much.
215200	217360	Like, you have this vanilla ice cream, right?
217360	221320	And he simultaneously stands for, like, oppressive religious extremism
221320	223480	and practices like conversion therapy,
223480	226280	but he also, like, stands for heterosexuality
226280	231640	and people who don't accept the existence of other ones at the same time.
231640	235560	The segment conflates physical sex, attraction, and gender expression
235560	239000	in a way that becomes confusing and actively makes the earlier segments
239000	242680	trying to explain the issue as simply as possible harder to understand.
242680	245640	Then, like, they're discussing favorite flavors of ice cream
245640	247000	when they are ice cream.
247000	250360	Like, is this a metaphor for sex or cannibalism?
250360	251720	Do they eat each other?
251720	254840	Is cannibalism legal in this ice cream-based universe?
254840	256360	How do they digest each other?
256360	257640	Do the ice creams fuck?
257640	258600	Why would you do this?
258600	260840	This episode gets across a lot of simple ideas
260840	262840	lots of people have hopefully seen and heard before,
262840	264520	like that trans people exist,
264520	268280	or that other physical, mental, psychological, and personality-based aspects
268280	271240	differentiate people far more than the genitals or chromosomes
271240	272440	they happen to be born with.
272440	275720	The other piece of terminology I expect a lot of people to be tripped up on
275720	278680	is the part where he brings up the concept of gender expression.
278680	282440	The more uninformed view of concepts like masculinity and femininity
282440	284600	is that they're linked directly to a person's gender,
284600	287400	and along with that, their physical sex or biology,
287400	290200	creating the expectation for prescribed roles and behaviors
290200	293080	based on a person's sex or gender or sexual preferences.
293080	295640	But the reality is that we see a broad range of behaviors
295640	298040	that take place often irrespective of these things.
298040	302040	This is something the LGBT community is far more ahead with than the mainstream.
302040	305240	Take, for example, the concepts of butch and femme in lesbian culture.
305240	308440	These are words used to describe the personalities of lesbian women.
308440	310600	You can be a woman attracted to other women,
310600	314600	but still express this very differently from other women attracted to women.
314600	317960	Gender expression is a wider acknowledgement of this sort of behavior,
317960	320760	and the idea that a person's personality is not something inherent
320760	324600	to the other aspects of their physical biology, gender, or sexuality.
324600	327800	To put it another way, I might be male, and you might be male,
327800	331000	but regardless, we both express maleness in different ways from each other
331000	335880	and have to define for ourselves what it means to even be male in the first place.
335960	339640	These sides of human behavior are fascinating and still developing fields of study,
339640	343000	and the way they're glossed over by being talked about very briefly
343000	345880	or turning up in the form of a mint chocolate chip ice cream
345880	348440	fails to really get these ideas across very well,
348440	351720	either in terms of summing up a subject you might be already familiar with
351720	354680	or in introducing it to you for the first time.
354680	360440	It gave a rudimentary, comedically slanted description of sex, gender, identity, and expression
360440	363320	that feels in itself a little too reductionist to be useful.
363320	367320	It basically tells you that these things exist, which, yeah.
367320	369320	I have my own criticisms of the show,
369320	374040	but I expect the rational raisins and smarty-pants scar bands of the world
374040	377880	to have their own very different problems with the show.
377880	381160	Let's look at a few in more detail and see if their problems hold water.
381160	384040	Here's a video by one of YouTube's most prominent skeptics,
384040	387240	and you know he's skeptical because he put it in his name!
387240	388760	Armored Skeptic.
388760	394040	I'm going to be using clips from both his video and various episodes of Bill Nye's new show,
394040	396040	so to make sure I'm not taking anything out of context,
396040	401160	I highly recommend that you watch his video and the show for yourself first.
401160	405640	The links are in the description and by Netflix.
405640	411320	The first segment is a skit where his persona argues with another version of himself,
411320	412600	voiced by himself.
412600	415000	Mondo respect. I think the guy's onto something with that.
415000	418360	He goes into an episode-by-episode breakdown, summing up his opinion on each.
418360	420840	The episode that deals with sex and gender is episode 9,
420840	423960	but I'll briefly point out some aspects of Skeptic's perspective—
423960	425240	God, that's a tongue twister—
425240	429240	on earlier episodes that I regard as illustrative of problems with his approach.
429240	432440	Episode 1 was all about climate change, and this is how he talks about it.
432440	434280	The first episode is about climate change,
434280	437800	and I was a little apprehensive about this one because this is Bill's subject,
437800	438840	but it was great!
438840	441400	Bill was a little awkward in front of the live audience,
441400	443400	but that only really added to the charm.
443400	446680	He doesn't get too political, he doesn't use too much hyperbole,
446680	449880	he demonstrates how climate change is affecting the planet today,
449880	453400	and even innovative ways that engineers are dealing with these problems.
453400	454600	I even liked the panel!
454600	458520	He had some guy on who said that he wanted the entire United States to be renewable,
458520	459880	and another guy on the panel was like,
459880	461080	no, that's a fantasy world.
461080	462920	It was great, it was really well-balanced.
462920	465720	I mean, no, he didn't have any climate change skeptics or anything,
465720	466520	but you know what I mean.
466520	469960	He congratulates the panel for being well-balanced.
469960	473400	The focus is on balance, on not taking a side.
473400	476840	So, is balance what we saw in that panel?
479480	483800	Professor Mark Jacobson outlines that while it may sound impossible to some people,
483800	488360	it is absolutely possible to make mankind's energy infrastructure completely renewable.
488360	490280	The main barriers are social and political.
490280	493960	You can see how this science professor might have to risk getting a bit political here,
493960	499240	you know, to fix the part where we all might die if it's not taken care—
499240	500440	you can see how it might—
500440	502920	politics might have to come into it at some point.
503000	505720	Meanwhile, Richard Martin, my main man Dick Mart,
505720	508440	thinks it's utopian and unrealistic to think that,
508440	511160	even though it's literally possible to actually do.
511160	515240	There are many people in the world who dismiss ideas that actually could work in practice,
515240	518040	and we know that because it's possible to check,
518040	521080	because they've decided it's too utopian.
521080	523800	He all but complains that there's no magic money tree.
523800	525160	Where have we heard that before?
525160	528200	He offers an alternative in the form of nuclear energy.
528200	532040	Jacobs retorts that the time it would take to get the many thousands of nuclear power plants
532040	534280	required to supplant traditional ones approved and built
534280	537320	would fail to correct our impact on the climate in time.
537320	539160	Dick Mart has no retort to this.
539160	543160	He just kind of continues harping on how crazy it would be
543160	546920	to do the thing that we statistically could do if we got our shit together.
547480	551320	Like, bro, you're trying to convince, like, millions of Americans
551320	556280	to allow dozens of thousands more nuclear plants into their backyard.
556280	558680	You gotta fucking explain how it'll work.
558840	560120	I even liked the panel.
560120	563880	He had some guy on who said that he wanted the entire United States to be renewable,
563880	565240	and another guy on the panel was like,
565240	566440	no, that's a fantasy world.
566440	568280	It was great. It was really well-balanced.
568280	571160	According to Skeptic, the panel is one person saying,
571160	575480	I want America to be this really wishful thinking pie-in-the-sky thing,
575480	577960	like, to have the entire United States be renewable,
577960	581320	and another person being more realistic and dismissing it as a fantasy,
581320	585160	something Skeptic has primed you to believe is a fantasy because he set it up like that.
585160	587960	It feels like he's projecting the reality of America
587960	590920	like he's projected his ideas of the social justice warrior
590920	595000	versus reasonable rational thinker discussion onto this subject.
595000	597160	The problem with thinking this panel is balanced,
597160	599160	or is supposed to try to be balanced,
599160	601560	is that science isn't balanced.
601560	603480	One of these guys was right.
603480	606280	One of these guys, you can check and it's actually true.
606280	607160	The other guy was just,
607160	610600	ah, it's utopian, just can't do it.
610600	615960	Let's build thousands of nuclear plants faster than we've ever done before with magic.
615960	616840	That'll solve it.
616840	618280	He doesn't get too political.
618280	621480	I'm just gonna laser focus on this for a second.
621480	624600	Skeptic appears, based on this and some comments we'll see later,
624600	629240	to think that being rational and objective relies on not being too politically biased.
629240	632840	But if you, for example, don't want mankind to die out,
632840	635960	or want things to get better for people,
635960	640200	and your focus is on finding ways to do this using science and facts and truth,
640200	643000	then you are unavoidably going to get political.
643000	644840	The current, though hopefully not for long,
644840	648040	Prime Minister of my country closed a group investigating climate change,
648040	650280	and is about to get into bed with the DUP,
650280	652040	a group known for, among other things,
652040	655160	thinking being gay is a sin and climate change denial,
655160	659080	and the current head of state in the USA thinks global warming was created by the Chinese
659080	661880	in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.
661880	663640	When you say climate change is real,
663640	665560	and people who don't think that are full of shit,
665560	667880	you're inherently making a political statement
667880	671080	because people in politics act based on views like this.
671080	674280	When you say you would prefer for the climate to not drastically change
674280	676760	in a way that would be unfortunate for the bulk of humanity,
676760	679800	you are unavoidably making a political statement.
679800	684440	This kind of writing implies skeptic worries this scientist is going to get too political.
684440	689880	I worry skeptic is trying to depoliticize a scientific problem that is very political indeed.
689880	691240	This is just me speculating,
691240	694600	but I'm struck with the sense that upon reaching more contentious episodes
694600	696280	based on science he's less familiar with,
696280	699480	or which relate to pressing social and political issues of the day,
699480	702760	skeptic was annoyed by Nye's alternative conclusions or ideas,
702760	705800	and rather than disagreeing with them for academic reasons,
705800	708200	he takes the view that he gets too political,
708200	711640	and therefore the bits he does like must have been less political, right?
711640	713400	But here's the problem with that view.
713400	717800	— What can we, as non-scientists, as non-brilliant engineers,
717800	719240	do trying to be a realist?
719240	720040	— VOTE!
720040	720540	— Yes.
720540	721040	— Yes.
721040	721540	— Yes.
721540	722040	— Yes.
722040	722540	— Yes.
722540	723040	— Yes.
723040	723540	— Yes.
723540	724040	— Yes.
724040	724540	— Yes.
724540	725040	— Yes.
725040	725540	— Yes.
725540	726040	— Yes.
726040	726540	— Yes.
726540	727040	— Yes.
727040	727540	— Yes.
727540	728040	— Yes.
728040	728540	— Yes.
728540	729040	— Yes.
729040	729540	— Yes.
729540	730040	— Yes.
730040	730540	— Yes.
730540	731040	— Yes.
731040	731540	— Yes.
731540	732040	— Yes.
732360	733960	— Participate. Go ahead.
733960	736600	He communicates that the episode isn't too political
736600	739800	when Bill Nye overtly asks the audience to vote,
739800	744200	which maybe would suggest not voting for people who think the entire issue is fake.
744200	747240	He's being positive about this episode to gear you up for when he
747240	750440	gets political later by saying things he didn't already agree with,
750440	753720	so he compliments the parts of the show he happens to agree with for
753720	755240	not being too political.
755240	758440	But Nye literally told you to vote based on the science.
758440	761800	I would argue that the section of the show where Nye desperately shouts
761800	766120	vote directly into the camera lens is one of the most overtly political things
766120	767720	he does in the entire show.
767720	770600	I'm willing to bet a climate change denier would criticize this episode
770600	772280	for being way too political.
772280	775640	The place where I disagree with Skeptic and my purely theoretical,
775640	779400	incredibly stupid climate change denier who bears no relation to Stephen Crowder
779400	783000	is that I think these problems inevitably have political implications
783000	785560	and exploring them is intellectually honest
785560	788200	and necessary for effecting positive change.
788200	791240	By pretending this isn't the case, Skeptic is setting himself up
791240	795160	for the parts he doesn't like being bad simply by nature of being political.
795160	797880	This episode is very clearly politically driven.
797880	800600	When he talks about episode two, he complains about the segment
800600	803960	where Prashant criticizes the use of Asian mysticism imagery
803960	806680	in Quack Healing to try and boost its cred,
806680	808920	and he talks about it like this.
808920	812200	A man named Prashant gets up on the stage
812200	814840	almost as if he was going to perform a stand-up routine,
814840	819480	but instead of making me laugh, he made me angry.
820440	824120	He made me very, very angry.
824760	828440	Prashant's lectured the entire white race
828440	831640	on how it's unacceptable to use Asian mysticism
831640	833560	because it's from a different culture.
833560	833960	What?
834760	835400	Listen, listen.
835400	837160	I know that it's tempting to do this.
837160	840840	I know how so many people think that they've figured out the formula,
840840	842200	but this needs to end.
842200	845880	If you think that you're that one person in the entire universe
845880	850200	who's figured out a way to talk down to an entire race of people
850200	855240	and lecture them on how to behave without coming across as a racist asshole,
856120	856920	stop.
856920	858360	Because you haven't figured it out.
858360	859320	It's impossible.
859320	859960	Get this, though.
859960	862920	Prashant says that he doesn't believe in Asian mysticism,
862920	865320	and he says that he doesn't like Asian mysticism.
865320	867800	In fact, he says that he hates it.
867800	869320	So why does it even matter?
869320	870680	Who does it, then?
870680	874360	You're trying to hog a part of your culture that you hate all to yourself?
874360	875400	It doesn't even make any sense.
875400	877480	What the fuck does that have to do with science?
877480	879560	What does this have to do with saving the world?
879560	880520	What even is this?
880520	884840	Why the fuck is somebody talking about the white race on the Bill Nye show?
884840	886760	After this, I'm pissed.
886760	888440	I'm trying to watch the third episode,
888440	891400	but my blood is boiling.
891400	894840	Okay, this segment is actually fascinating in numerous ways
894840	898120	and almost makes me question Skeptic's intellectual honesty
898120	900920	in regards to accurately presenting the content of the show.
900920	903240	It contains numerous falsehoods and omissions.
903240	907720	The first false assertion is that this segment is about how Prashant was mad at white people
907720	910280	for appropriating a culture that wasn't theirs.
910280	913960	Prashant's lectured the entire white race
913960	917160	on how it's unacceptable to use Asian mysticism
917160	918680	because it's from a different culture.
920040	921480	I don't want to do this to Skeptic,
921480	923320	but that's just not true.
923320	925240	That isn't what happened here.
925240	929640	Skeptic is attempting to accuse him of arguing about cultural appropriation,
929640	932200	but he's actually talking about the well-known problem
932200	936360	of quacks attempting to hide pseudoscience behind Asian mysticism.
936360	938520	So you say it's magic and that it cures gout
938520	940440	and for good measure you throw in a Ganesh statue
940440	942440	just to give it this ancient wisdom-y feel.
943160	945880	Prashant even name drops an infamous example
945880	947960	who is himself of Asian descent,
947960	951320	so he's definitely not talking about appropriation.
951320	953160	It's actually the oldest trick in the book.
953160	954600	Half nonsense, half Indian.
954600	955800	It's called the Deepak Chopra.
958040	962280	Why the fuck is somebody talking about the white race on the Bill Nye show?
962280	964440	It seems like Skeptic heard Prashant say,
964440	965480	hey, white people,
965480	967160	and then he, like, turned his brain off
967160	970840	and didn't, like, didn't see this bit?
971560	974360	Like, I'm genuinely curious if he remembers this part.
974360	976840	The second false assertion is that this is a lecture,
976840	978760	a man talking down to a group of people
978760	982600	in some kind of mad antagonistic puritanical screed.
982600	985480	This inaccurately represents the tone of the segment.
985480	989880	Let's play back one of the brief clips Skeptic uses of this part on mute,
989880	991880	but with the sound on this time.
991880	993880	White people, I love you,
993880	996760	but stop using Asian wallpaper for street cred.
996760	998280	I see what you're doing.
998280	1000920	This segment is a stand-up comedy routine.
1000920	1004200	The man performing this skit is a stand-up comedian.
1004200	1006520	Part of the joke is the hyperbolic way
1006520	1009240	he's talking down to entire races of people.
1009240	1011160	That's right, races.
1011160	1013640	Which is why I want to say something to my fellow Asians.
1013640	1015800	Asians, lend me your ears.
1015800	1018120	Stop convincing white people it is real.
1018120	1020360	This is as much on you as it is on them.
1020360	1021960	You know how gullible they are.
1023240	1026120	Prashanth is being superlative for comedic effect
1026120	1028360	to get across a quite genuine idea,
1028360	1030280	and the audience is laughing along with it.
1030280	1032440	This isn't a lecture in the slightest.
1032440	1034440	The third false assertion is this one.
1034440	1036760	And he says that he doesn't like Asian miscism.
1036760	1039160	In fact, he says that he hates it.
1039160	1041880	Prashanth never says anything like this.
1041880	1043640	He doesn't hate Asian culture.
1043640	1045720	He hates it being used to sell remedies
1045720	1048680	with no basis in science, regardless of race.
1048680	1051000	Asians, stop selling unregulated remedies
1051000	1052440	with no scientific basis,
1052440	1054600	and white people, stop using Asian culture
1054600	1057640	to sell unregulated remedies with no scientific proof.
1057640	1060040	Look, I get that cultural appropriation
1060040	1061400	and how it's not a problem
1061400	1064200	is a popular talking point in the skeptic community,
1064200	1065800	but that doesn't necessarily mean
1065800	1068440	everyone is always talking about appropriation,
1068440	1070120	and treating this segment like one
1070120	1071960	has caused Skeptic to miss out on a point
1071960	1075000	that I'm actually, like, 99% sure he agrees with.
1075000	1076200	These assertions are wrong,
1076200	1078360	but, you know, people make mistakes
1078360	1080600	and have biases that impact how they view things.
1080600	1083080	That's okay. I do that, too, all the time.
1083080	1085080	But where it gets kind of shady
1085080	1086280	is when you stop and realize
1086280	1089000	how this video is seemingly constructed on purpose
1089000	1090840	to make sure someone watching this review
1090840	1092600	without having seen the show
1092600	1094440	wouldn't possibly be able to notice
1094440	1095800	these claims are false.
1095800	1098360	I'm gonna think like a video editor for a second here.
1098360	1100360	When Skeptic was making this video,
1100360	1102760	he had this episode of the show open in his timeline
1102760	1103800	and he was scrubbing through it
1103800	1105000	to look for bits of the show
1105000	1106200	to put in his video
1106200	1108600	to demonstrate problems or events he's describing.
1108600	1111240	Prashanth makes his hyperbolic jokes
1111240	1112360	and people laugh,
1112360	1114920	and then he talks about a genuine manipulative tactic
1114920	1116840	used by pseudoscientific quacks.
1116840	1118520	When Skeptic talks about this section
1118520	1119800	and how racist it was
1119800	1121160	and how angry it made him,
1121160	1122760	he shows only this brief clip
1122760	1125000	with the show's closed captions turned on.
1125080	1127720	He uses the section most easily interpretable
1127720	1130760	to make this section be what he thinks it's about,
1130760	1133480	namely an Asian man racisting at white people,
1133480	1135240	and the clip doesn't continue long enough
1135240	1137160	to get to the actual meat of his real,
1137160	1139240	though comedically slanted, argument.
1139240	1141160	Also, I think this is accidental.
1141160	1144040	There's another subtly manipulative thing happening here.
1144040	1145160	You see, in some segments,
1145160	1147640	Skeptic uses clips from the episode with the sound on
1147640	1150280	so he can show them saying the thing and respond to it.
1150280	1153000	This would be one of the prime sections to do it, right?
1153000	1155240	Like, he spends a good portion of this video
1155240	1156520	harping on this segment.
1156520	1159320	He talks about this bit of this episode
1159320	1162840	more than he does for several entire episodes collectively.
1162840	1166440	It would make sense to show the clip of him saying this
1166440	1167800	and let us hear it,
1167800	1168760	but if he did that...
1168760	1171000	I see what you're doing.
1171000	1172840	...you'd hear people laughing.
1172840	1175800	And no, Prashanth was ultimately making a joke,
1175800	1177320	and this wouldn't jibe well
1177320	1179640	with Skeptic's view that this was some kind of
1179640	1182680	serious racist lecture at white people.
1182680	1185720	Similarly, when he claims Prashanth says he hates Asian culture,
1185720	1187640	it would have really supported his argument
1187640	1189880	to show the clip of him, you know, saying that
1189880	1191880	or put it in the background while he talked,
1191880	1193480	but he didn't use that clip
1193480	1195560	because that clip doesn't exist.
1195560	1197720	If he'd used a clip of Prashanth saying
1197720	1200440	he hates when Asian culture is used to take people's money
1200440	1203320	and sell forms of treatment or medicine that don't work,
1203320	1206280	that would make him look like he was saying that, wouldn't it?
1206280	1207560	So he couldn't use that.
1207560	1209160	I'd also like to go back and point out
1209160	1211480	that he doesn't use any supplemental footage
1211480	1213560	of the panel he talked about in episode one.
1213560	1216200	I think if it had happened the way he thought it did,
1216200	1217960	he would have had footage to call on here,
1217960	1221000	but instead, its absence is rendered palpable.
1221000	1222920	I don't think this is purposeful dishonesty.
1222920	1224920	I think Skeptic had simply already arrived
1224920	1226840	at his conclusions when he'd written his script,
1226840	1228680	and when he was editing the video together,
1228680	1231160	he just didn't notice the show isn't really saying
1231160	1232600	what he thought it was saying.
1232600	1234600	If you don't notice someone saying something
1234600	1236280	you would probably agree with
1236280	1238040	because of a little joke they made,
1238040	1239640	it makes this video end up saying
1239640	1242680	more about Skeptic's personal approach to watching media
1242680	1243880	than the show itself,
1243880	1245880	which I don't think is what he was going for.
1245880	1247320	This is, to put it simply,
1247320	1249880	political and ideological bias in action,
1249880	1252760	and I think this is why Skeptic didn't enjoy the show.
1252760	1254680	He even dismisses Prashant's segment
1254680	1257720	as if it looked like it was going to be stand-up but wasn't.
1257720	1260360	Now, Prashant is literally a comedian.
1260360	1261720	I could make a defense of his act.
1261720	1263720	You know, comedians like to push at boundaries,
1263720	1265480	and that includes racial ones,
1265480	1268520	point out that it's important to defend their right to do that,
1268520	1270280	and also alleged mischaracterizing
1270280	1271800	of people's racially charged jokes
1271800	1274680	is something he himself has railed against in the past,
1274680	1275960	but I'm not going to do that here
1275960	1278120	because it's time to talk about the actual episode
1278120	1279400	this whole video is about,
1279400	1282840	which Skeptic addresses for most of the second half of this video.
1282840	1285640	Bill uses the term cis male.
1285640	1292200	Who better to talk about sex than two cis male white guys?
1292200	1293320	Cringe.
1293320	1296120	This part of the video strikes me as really odd.
1296120	1298040	Skeptic implies quite overtly
1298040	1301240	that using words like cis is inherently a bad thing,
1301240	1303640	but it's the counterpart prefix to trans
1303640	1306600	and a very useful term when discussing these ideas.
1306600	1308440	Unless, of course, he's not trying to imply
1308440	1310600	that using the term cis is inherently bad.
1310600	1312520	Maybe he just disagrees with the nomenclature.
1312520	1314120	I mean, many writers in this field
1314120	1316200	do prefer terms like non-trans
1316200	1318760	as a way of making the subject easier to understand,
1318760	1321560	but he doesn't elaborate further than saying cringe,
1321560	1325080	so all I have to go on is Skeptic saying Bill Nye said a word,
1325080	1326760	and it made him feel weird.
1326760	1331400	Bill explains that there is no way to gender a brain by examining it,
1331400	1334040	and then explains that just like biology,
1334040	1335800	gender is also on a spectrum.
1335800	1337560	Bill does not take this opportunity
1337560	1340200	to discuss the connection between biology and gender.
1340200	1342280	Instead, he just explains the spectrum
1342280	1345480	as if there is no correlation between sex and gender.
1345480	1347080	I found this a little disappointing
1347080	1350520	because I wanted to know what scientists know about gender identity,
1350520	1352680	but instead Bill just shrugs and moves on.
1352680	1354200	Listen, Greg, you know,
1354200	1356680	if you wanted to know what the scientists think about this,
1356840	1359240	you didn't have to wait until Bill Nye got a new show
1359240	1361480	like 20 years later to find out.
1362360	1364280	You can just, like, check.
1364920	1366280	You can look it up.
1366280	1369880	Bill Nye is not the only source for what the scientists think about this.
1369880	1371240	The previous episodes of the show,
1371240	1372920	which he had less of a problem with,
1372920	1375880	also don't cite the evidence in the precise way
1375880	1377960	that he seems to expect specifically
1377960	1381000	when it's on a topic that he doesn't agree with or know much about.
1381000	1383240	Nye doesn't bring up the specifics of forcing,
1383240	1384680	or the ice sheets,
1384680	1387880	or planetary albedo in the climate change video,
1387880	1389240	but that doesn't mean you should just assume
1389240	1391000	there is no science and it doesn't exist,
1391000	1392920	unless, of course, you're Steven Crowder.
1392920	1396120	The show is simply trying to find a way to explain these topics
1396120	1399400	to a general audience in a way that's not too complicated,
1399400	1401320	and that's all right.
1401320	1404440	Bill calls the fourth one expression.
1404440	1407560	It's the way people express their gender.
1407560	1410520	Bill, um, uh, Bill,
1410600	1415720	what's the difference between gender and gender expression?
1415720	1417800	What even is gender expression?
1417800	1419480	A good portion of this section of the video
1419480	1421480	is Skeptic incredulously asking questions
1421480	1423960	he could literally look up in a matter of seconds.
1425160	1426600	What is gender expression?
1426600	1428040	How does it relate to gender?
1428040	1430520	Is there a correlation with biology?
1430520	1434600	Like, what percentage of the population expresses?
1434600	1436680	There's a little secret with gender expression.
1437560	1438060	It's...
1438520	1439320	It's made up.
1440280	1441480	It's fashion.
1442040	1444840	It's fucking fashion.
1444840	1445720	It's fashion.
1446520	1449560	Now, maybe it's wrong to hold Skeptic
1449560	1452040	to the same standards he holds Bill Nye to.
1452040	1454840	I mean, Bill Nye is working on a fully produced show
1454840	1458280	with a team of writers and researchers and, yes, comedians,
1458840	1461480	but, well, Skeptic doesn't explain either
1461480	1463960	what the scientists think or why they think this
1463960	1467400	or what the science is to support this conclusion he makes.
1467400	1470120	He doesn't cite any sources to support this himself.
1470120	1473000	He complains Bill Nye isn't being scientific enough
1473000	1475000	and then in the next few sentences
1475000	1477800	leaps directly into an unsupported conclusion.
1477800	1480600	He even, and this is the interesting part I wanted to get to,
1480600	1481960	makes this comment.
1481960	1485000	There aren't even any statistics or studies
1485000	1488520	or psychological papers or polls or anything.
1488520	1489720	Okay, here we are.
1489720	1490840	The brass ring.
1490840	1493080	This is what we in the tennis commentating business
1493080	1494920	call an unforced error.
1495880	1497480	Wait, no, that's—that's golf.
1497480	1500040	You see, when he dismisses this as fashion,
1500040	1501640	there's some ambiguity there.
1501640	1503800	If he just said that, you could interpret this
1503800	1506280	as him saying he's done some research into the topic
1506280	1508360	and come to the conclusion based on his reading
1508360	1510760	that gender expression is a useless term.
1510760	1514760	You'd wonder what he'd read and how he came to that conclusion,
1514760	1516840	but you'd at least be able to credibly assume
1516840	1519800	he'd looked at the academic writing on the subject at some point.
1519800	1521560	But then he directly says,
1521560	1525000	No research has been done and no papers have been written.
1525000	1528040	And then, to make sure you know that's what he meant,
1528040	1529160	he says it again.
1529160	1532600	Bill says science is the process we use to understand nature,
1532600	1536520	but there is no science about gender expression, Bill.
1536520	1538920	That was just fucking nonsense.
1538920	1542360	So I'm beginning to see why Skeptic had a problem with this episode.
1542360	1545240	This episode would be really bad
1545240	1548680	if it was based in absolutely no science, wouldn't it?
1548680	1551640	Unfortunately, if you think that,
1551640	1553400	I have some bad news for you.
1553400	1555720	You might be wondering what these weird words
1555720	1558760	and names and texts scrolling past the screen are right now.
1558760	1562440	These are just a short list of peer-reviewed papers and studies
1562440	1564280	specifically into gender expression
1564280	1567880	and the nature of its relation with gender identity and biology.
1567880	1570200	And believe me, this is a short list.
1570200	1574040	You can find a much longer list by looking for the studies.
1574040	1577080	So now, you and I know that there are studies into this.
1577080	1579240	But Skeptic seemingly doesn't.
1579240	1582280	He openly, directly denies they exist.
1582280	1584280	How do you explain this discrepancy?
1584280	1586840	Now, the cynical conclusion, the one I doubt,
1586840	1588920	is that he doesn't care about the truth, really,
1588920	1592120	and he thinks his audience is stupid enough to not check for themselves,
1592120	1594920	and they'll just nod in agreement with a statement
1594920	1597480	that confirms their own unresearched beliefs.
1597480	1599640	But I think the alternative is more likely.
1599640	1602680	Skeptic assumed there hadn't been any research,
1602680	1604520	and it didn't occur to him to check.
1604520	1605960	This is a pretty big error.
1605960	1607640	Like, it's very quick to check,
1607640	1610840	and the studies that result from checking are very informative and interesting
1610840	1613480	and challenge the idea that gender expression is made up
1613480	1616120	and equivalent to just trying to be fashionable.
1616120	1617800	Even if these studies are flawed,
1617800	1621960	or Skeptic could offer an alternative reading that justifies the idea it's fashion,
1621960	1623880	he doesn't provide that analysis here.
1623880	1627480	And also, he can't, because he doesn't seem to know they exist,
1627480	1631960	which is kind of a problem when they do.
1631960	1635160	Now, this is where I was hoping to get into the meat of the video, right?
1635160	1638920	Like, discuss interpretations and conclusions of studies and data,
1638920	1640600	but we got all the way here,
1640600	1643080	and it turns out that you, the viewing audience,
1643080	1647320	are going to be denied the money shot of raw, hardcore data analysis,
1647320	1651560	because GargleSeptic has no data supporting his argument to analyze.
1651560	1653800	He has no criticism of the existing studies,
1653800	1655400	which exist, for me to debunk,
1655400	1658120	and, in fact, he denies the existence of those studies.
1658120	1661240	So, even pointing out that, yes, studies exist,
1661240	1663480	the most rudimentary point possible,
1663480	1667800	is enough to completely dash his entire argument against the rocks of reality.
1667800	1671160	All his claims about gender expression, that it's all just fashion, etc.,
1671160	1675960	are predicated on the non-existence of scientific examinations that actually do exist.
1675960	1680360	Even if those studies themselves proved that it was all just fashion and fake,
1680360	1681640	how would he know?
1681640	1683640	He simply hasn't checked.
1683640	1686280	Maybe he has an epistemological problem with those studies,
1686280	1689560	but, to find that out, he would have to check they exist,
1689560	1692920	and see they exist, and read them, and talk about them,
1692920	1694840	and he's done none of those things.
1694840	1697240	That's not the application of reason at all.
1697240	1699160	Checking to see if studies into this exist
1699160	1701800	takes literally as long as it takes a Google search to resolve,
1701800	1704440	which, in my case, was 0.6 seconds.
1704440	1707000	That's the quickest debunking I've ever had to do.
1707000	1709640	There's two very clear reasoning problems here.
1709640	1712760	The first is that, without any significant explanation that this is the case,
1712760	1715480	Skeptic situates, it's fake and all just fashion,
1715480	1718280	as the null hypothesis for gender expression.
1718280	1720120	He makes this the natural baseline
1720120	1723000	from which all other conclusions must prove their case,
1723000	1724600	but his, of course, doesn't have to,
1724600	1726840	because he's decided it's the default state.
1726840	1731400	This conveniently frees him from having to prove his assertions without any evidence.
1731400	1732840	This is just the way things are,
1732840	1734680	and if Bill Nye doesn't prove otherwise,
1734680	1736600	or I can't find any studies showing otherwise
1736600	1738520	because I can't find them or didn't look for them,
1738520	1739800	then I have to be right,
1739800	1741240	and I don't even have to prove it.
1741240	1743800	This is the exact sort of shifting of the burden of proof
1743800	1746440	the atheist Skeptic circle will be highly familiar with
1746440	1749160	if they've ever encountered a presuppositionalist theist.
1749160	1751640	Someone whose central arguments amounted to insisting
1751640	1754840	that God's existence is how one should naturally assume the world is,
1754840	1757720	and it's up to disbelievers to prove God doesn't exist,
1757720	1760600	meaning they could dismiss people merely skeptical of positive proof
1760600	1763880	without having to ever bother paying attention to what they have to say.
1763880	1766680	Combine this with a disastrous inability or unwillingness
1766680	1768920	to understand science or how evidence works,
1768920	1770840	and they've built themselves a perfect box
1770840	1773320	from which they'll never have to even think about leaving.
1773320	1776280	Skeptic would doubtless see this flawed logic in an instant
1776280	1779480	if he ever saw Syten, Brugge, and Cate making this kind of argument,
1779480	1781560	but substitute the existence of God
1781560	1783880	for the non-existence of gender expression,
1783880	1786040	and here he is making that argument.
1786040	1787000	Bill says,
1787000	1789240	We need to go with the science,
1789240	1792680	and the science says we're all on a spectrum.
1792680	1794040	Um...
1794040	1795240	No.
1795240	1797240	Um...
1799240	1800920	Yes!
1800920	1801960	It's a trend.
1801960	1804360	It's trendy for boys to wear makeup.
1804360	1806920	It's trendy for girls to wear bowties.
1806920	1807640	That's it.
1807640	1808760	Don't push it, Greg.
1808760	1811800	You know for a fact that bowties make anyone sexier,
1811800	1813960	regardless of gender identity.
1813960	1816840	Speaking of which, this bowtie was actually made for me by my mother.
1816840	1818520	I wore this to a wedding.
1818520	1819880	I was gonna put a joke here,
1819880	1822280	but I just like this bowtie. It's really nice.
1822280	1823400	Thanks, Mom.
1823400	1826600	Then they proceed to give in to their urges
1826600	1830360	and start licking each other like a bunch of fucking sluts.
1830360	1832360	You know, I didn't like this segment either,
1832360	1836200	but I wouldn't personally have slut-shamed the ice cream.
1836200	1838600	Sorry.
1838600	1839400	Sorry.
1839400	1841560	I just realized the words that I said.
1841560	1843080	I mean, maybe I have it all wrong.
1843080	1844760	Maybe it was just played for laughs.
1844760	1847800	You know, like, maybe this is intentionally absurdist.
1847800	1849320	Really?
1849320	1851240	What gave it away, Greg?
1851240	1855320	What part of the comedy cartoon ice cream licking party
1855320	1857320	came across to you as absurd?
1857320	1864760	...
1864760	1866840	Bill then uses mannequins to demonstrate
1866840	1869640	that sex and gender are not really set in stone,
1869640	1871880	biology isn't always clear-cut,
1871880	1874040	and that the whole thing is relative.
1874040	1875720	Okay, I'm fine with that.
1875720	1878360	If this was Bill's intended message,
1878360	1880600	then I have to commend Bill for saying this.
1880600	1885320	Tolerance of people who don't fit social and biological norms is important.
1885320	1889400	We don't have to try to understand or relate to LGBT people,
1889400	1892280	but we can at least treat them like human beings.
1892280	1895720	Even if you are what they call a trans-trender,
1895720	1896360	I don't care.
1896360	1898520	Be whatever flavor of ice cream you want to be.
1898520	1900040	The message of tolerance is a good one,
1900040	1901480	and I fully agree with that part.
1901480	1903240	I've interrogated some of his arguments
1903240	1906600	and laughed at his weird comments about the slutty ice creams,
1906600	1909320	but I think it's really important that I leave this bit in here.
1909320	1911160	A good portion of my response today has been about
1911160	1914600	the often accidental duplicitousness of video editing,
1914680	1917080	and I feel like not putting this segment in here
1917640	1919800	would imply that he doesn't say stuff like that,
1919800	1921160	and I couldn't abide doing that,
1921160	1922520	so I thought I'd leave it in here.
1922520	1924680	He puts this in here specifically because
1924680	1926280	he knows there are people out there
1926280	1928520	who think that trans and non-binary people
1928520	1930760	don't have a right to exist,
1930760	1932280	or in fact don't exist at all,
1932280	1936360	and it's all just mentally ill people or trenders who are pretending,
1936360	1938840	and it's important to take a stance against
1938840	1941400	people being ridiculously shitty like that,
1941400	1945480	even if the science didn't shake out in favor of their existence,
1945480	1946760	which it does.
1946760	1948040	The problem with Skeptic's video
1948040	1950200	has nothing to do with any explicit bigotry.
1950200	1952200	It's more to do with how he grasps the science
1952200	1954280	and how he approached the show itself,
1954280	1956520	and for a person who calls themselves a skeptic,
1957080	1959480	not being willing to check if they're wrong
1959480	1960920	by looking up the science
1960920	1962360	constitutes something of a problem
1962360	1964040	that I think is worth talking about.
1964040	1966840	While I have very often and repeatedly satirized
1966840	1970760	the language and implied values of the so-called skeptic community,
1970760	1975240	I do actually also believe that skepticism and reason
1975240	1977480	and facts and logic and evidence
1977480	1979880	and all those other buzzwords are actually important.
1979880	1981720	They do mean something,
1981720	1983320	and they are worth thinking about.
1984040	1986120	Greg doesn't seem like a bad person to me.
1986120	1987640	You know, I make these videos,
1987640	1989400	and sometimes I'm really mocking of people,
1989400	1991480	either to be over-the-top because I think it's funny,
1991480	1993320	or because I know their minds won't be changed
1993320	1995640	because they're just so far out there.
1995640	1998200	I'm curious, now that I've definitively made him aware
1998200	1999240	that the subjects exist,
1999240	2000840	if he does watch this video,
2000840	2003880	if skeptic will change his mind in accordance with the evidence,
2003880	2006280	or at least develop a new perspective on the issues
2006280	2008200	based on the stuff that I've pointed out.
2008920	2011800	I think this is actually the first time I've genuinely thought,
2012360	2014040	maybe some progress is going to happen here.
2014040	2015640	Maybe someone's going to watch this and go,
2015640	2017640	oh man, there is science and I missed it.
2017640	2019160	That would be really interesting, wouldn't it?
2019160	2022440	Although honestly, given the speed that discourse moves that on the internet,
2022440	2025000	maybe he's already developed his opinion further.
2025000	2028600	I don't have the time to watch all of everyone's videos nowadays
2028600	2030600	because I'm so busy making my own stuff,
2030600	2034040	or, you know, reading the studies.
2034040	2036280	♪ Science rules! ♪
2036280	2038840	Speaking of time, I did not intend for this video to get this long.
2038840	2041560	I was going to cover a whole bunch of people in this video,
2041560	2044040	and I ended up getting sidetracked completely by just one.
2044840	2047320	Gosh, I've got to be at the airport in like...
2048520	2049640	12 MINUTES?!
2053640	2055560	I've got to go! We'll cover the rest next time!
2056200	2057880	God! Shit! Fuck!
2058840	2059800	Jesus! Fuck!
2059800	2062360	Where's the- where's the fucking briefcase?!
2062360	2063400	Oh, shit!
