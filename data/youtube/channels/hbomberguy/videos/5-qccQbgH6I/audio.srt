00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Hello, I'm not legendary game designer Lorne Lanning,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,660
so I don't know why you're wasting your time here.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,160
But, hey, while I've got you,

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,660
I recently passed 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.com,

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,200
and after three months and one official complaint

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,500
to YouTube management,

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,540
my plaque finally arrived to confirm it.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,420
Anyway, it seems to be customary for YouTubers

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,160
to do some sort of Q&A video

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
when they hit a certain amount of subscribers,

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,660
and I love answering questions.

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,620
I love discussing stuff.

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,780
Uh, so I really felt like I should do one of those.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,360
I put out a thing, uh, months ago

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,100
asking people to provide questions

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,100
that they thought would be good for this sort of thing,

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,940
and I also held back a couple of questions

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,900
that I got on Curious Cat

19
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,640
I thought would be worth answering on video.

20
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,400
So, uh, we're gonna do that now.

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,780
How old are you?

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,780
Okay, I actually, um, made, like, little bits of notes

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,440
next to some of the questions that I thought,

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,780
oh, I might forget this when I'm actually recording it,

25
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,860
and for some reason, in brackets, I put,

26
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,780
it's 25 here.

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,140
I'm not really sure why I did that.

28
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,760
I must have very low expectations of myself.

29
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,680
Anyway, yeah, I'm 25.

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,500
I've kind of looked like I was 14 for most of my life.

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,580
My hairline has always been this far receded,

32
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,920
so you can't make fun of it

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,540
because I'm comfortable with this.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,260
I fully expect to go bald within the next three to six months.

35
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,620
I can't wait, to be honest.

36
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,460
You know, I've never really cared about my appearance,

37
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,500
as you can tell from just the way I dress and look.

38
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,740
You can't let yourself care about your appearance

39
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,500
when you look like me. It would destroy me.

40
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,200
So I've always kind of just messed with my hair.

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,000
I've always kind of grown it out super long for no reason

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,580
and then shaved it all off just to see what would happen.

43
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,700
Usually, it's looked rubbish, but I've never really cared.

44
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,540
One time, I dyed my hair, like, really, really yellowy blonde

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,740
for a video that I ended up deciding wasn't worth making,

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,240
and the time for it has passed.

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,860
It was a music video starring me as Milo Yiannopoulos.

48
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,640
It's probably the most extravagant thing I'd ever done,

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,860
and I dyed my hair for it, and it had to grow out,

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,480
so it was like eight months of awful hair

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,820
for a piece that I decided to not make.

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,360
So if you're wondering why my hair was awful

53
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,600
for a long stretch of last year and this year, that was why.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,240
I actually made it with two other friends.

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,100
One of them was the musician who composed a bunch of it,

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,380
and the other one sort of helped out on set

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,380
when we were shooting it,

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,340
and that guy also had a camcorder

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,560
and was filming the whole process,

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,640
including me dyeing my hair, so there's, like, a good...

61
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,760
There's a good two-hour rubbish documentary

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,380
about the hijinks that we got up to attempting

63
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,600
to make this thing that I ended up never finishing.

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
It looks like it's working.

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I can feel something happening,

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
but I can also see my skin getting kind of reddish.

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,300
Maybe I should edit that together for patrons.

68
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,720
That would be a fun thing to do. Let me know.

69
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,560
Anyway, I'm done hijacking that question

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,260
and to ramble about my hair now, so let's move on.

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,060
What's your favorite piece of fan fiction of any kind ever?

72
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,420
You specified of any kind,

73
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,340
which means I get to take wild leaps,

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,920
so nice one there.

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,680
My personal favorite fan fiction ever

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,800
is a film that came out in 2014 called The Guest.

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,060
The Guest is really, really good, by the way.

78
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,640
You should watch it. It's really, really good.

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,760
Dan Stevens, amazing in it.

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,520
British people represent.

81
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,220
That film is very clearly

82
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,600
Chris Evans-era

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
Captain America fan fiction.

84
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,440
It is very deliberately a guy on the run

85
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,220
from a S.H.I.E.L.D.-style organization

86
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,440
trying to be a good person, live his own life in a world

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
that no longer suits him.

88
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,220
The serial numbers have been filed off,

89
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,800
but there is a very clear S.H.I.E.L.D.-type organization.

90
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,680
I mean, it might not actually be at all.

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,180
There might not have been anyone's plan whatsoever,

92
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,680
and I've just read into the film.

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,300
It wouldn't be the first time,

94
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,600
but for me, it's just a really, really good film,

95
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,300
and it has enough little things in there

96
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,220
that it qualifies as this kind of rumination

97
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,600
on the kind of super soldier

98
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,920
that Captain America is in the more recent films,

99
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
and I think that's kind of interesting.

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
It's also just a really good film.

101
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,180
I am now, however, going to give my favorite fan fiction

102
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,220
that's an actual fan fiction

103
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,220
so that I've actually answered the question properly.

104
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,500
As for my favorite piece of actual fan fiction,

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,040
you have to go with My Immortal.

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,820
It's really funny.

107
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,280
It's definitely a parody of other fan fictions

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,360
and the fights that happen when people collaborate on them.

109
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,440
It's definitely a parody.

110
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,980
I—if you don't agree that's a lie, it's not true.

111
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,200
I'll see you in hell.

112
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,360
It's—it's good, and it's funny.

113
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
This next one's a long one.

114
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,400
Great.

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,660
Could you recommend some good social sciences literature

116
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,200
for beginners or other literature

117
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,820
that has influenced you the most?

118
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,240
I'd love to be as articulate and good

119
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,780
at critical thinking as you.

120
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,980
That won't be too hard.

121
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,680
Many of my acquaintances are right-leaning

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
and pretty racist, sexist, homophobic, et cetera.

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,900
Still, I feel like I could easily give them

124
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,740
a bit of perspective if I only had enough knowledge

125
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,140
and good argumentative skills.

126
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,220
People have asked me for reading lists quite often.

127
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,480
This is kind of a question that I held back

128
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,720
because it's emblematic of a lot of questions I get.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,020
If I were to come up with, like, a list,

130
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,640
it would just be just a lot of books

131
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,020
from a variety of different categories

132
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
because quite often something really simple

133
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,520
that isn't really about any particular issue

134
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,320
informs your perspective a lot,

135
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,020
even though it's not even covering it.

136
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,680
So rather than, like, just give you a list

137
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,640
of all the books I happen to have read

138
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,100
or pretend that I'm educated enough

139
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,400
to know how to construct a reading list for someone else,

140
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm just gonna give some general broad strokes

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,280
sort of recommendations for how to educate yourself

142
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,860
and then give some actual recommendations.

143
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,560
So I think I would first recommend

144
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,820
looking at the basic ideas

145
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,720
that underlie any particular social science.

146
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,220
So, like, psychology, sociology,

147
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,620
the other humanities, you know, the rest,

148
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,760
whatever you want to call them,

149
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,580
they exist for a reason to study a specific thing

150
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,960
and they usually have some kind of specific goal in mind.

151
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,200
So, like, psychology is the study of human behavior

152
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
but also has the kind of goal

153
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,120
of making people more healthy.

154
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,200
I once read this little tiny book

155
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,440
from years and years and years ago,

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
it was really old,

157
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,500
called Psychoanalysis for Normal People

158
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,980
and it opened with a statement that said,

159
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,180
what's the effect of,

160
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,740
the purpose of psychoanalysis

161
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,300
is to make you ready for anything, something like that.

162
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,020
That, to me, was this sort of,

163
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,220
aha, you know, this is why we do this.

164
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,940
It's not just, ah, we're checking to see what would happen

165
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,820
if you lock people up in a fake prison.

166
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,580
It's we're trying to learn how we behave

167
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,780
in different contexts so that we can better understand

168
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,140
contexts we can create that enhance human behavior.

169
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,400
You know, can we educate ourselves out

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,280
of certain behaviors that we exhibit?

171
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,760
I'd basically recommend you go to the source,

172
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,160
look up the reasoning behind why a field of study exists.

173
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,800
Like, why do people do psychiatry or psychology

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
or sociology or any of the other humanities?

175
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,400
Why, what is its purpose?

176
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
What is it looking at?

177
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,720
And what are its methodologies?

178
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,020
And why is it beneficial to use them?

179
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,880
I think a lot of people lack the sort of

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,480
base level understanding of what it does and why

181
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,840
that makes the whole thing make sense.

182
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,360
So I don't think, I'm not sure if I have it anywhere,

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,280
but when I was in my third year of university,

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
I was doing an English and film degree,

185
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
so I had lots of free time.

186
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,760
I actually just started buying science and sociology books

187
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,720
off of people who were doing either like a master's

188
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,000
or were finishing and were selling their books.

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,520
So I could just, out of interest, read what they were like.

190
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,480
And that was kind of a, I guess, a flashpoint

191
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,000
for my own understanding of these concepts,

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
was bothering to just pick up a basic book on it and read it.

193
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
In fact, I'm going to look for it now.

194
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,000
Carry my portable recorder with me.

195
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,400
I keep a bunch of books back here,

196
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,580
and I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure my old applied,

197
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,360
my old applied psychology book is here somewhere.

198
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,520
I literally just like, there was a girl

199
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
who was just finishing a master's and she was leaving,

200
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,840
and she was selling all of the books that she bought

201
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,440
because they're expensive.

202
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,080
So people want to buy them used.

203
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,440
Ah, the set is too big.

204
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
It's in the way of my library.

205
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,200
So they just started selling all the books.

206
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,440
And here we are, I found it.

207
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,440
It's next to my Call of Cthulhu third edition book.

208
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
Well, I don't know what edition is actually.

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
And also my collected works of George Orwell.

210
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,060
This is why I don't have much of a system for this library.

211
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Ah, so this was the book that I,

212
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,500
this was the book that I bought just for the fun of it.

213
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
One of these, I have a couple others

214
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,820
that I got off different people.

215
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,060
And they're just books where they're basically

216
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,500
just a primer on what the issue is.

217
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,960
The most interesting part of the book for me,

218
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,300
as someone who wasn't as interested

219
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,700
in the social sciences at the time,

220
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,340
was the preface, the introduction,

221
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,020
and the, yeah, like, this was it.

222
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,420
This was the eye-opening moment.

223
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,340
1.1 of the introduction, what is applied psychology?

224
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,860
Like, it opens by explaining what it is

225
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,300
and what it's for and why you would care.

226
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,340
And that's the most important part of these books,

227
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,580
in my opinion, is explaining why it's valuable,

228
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,620
why you would use it, and the purpose of approaching things

229
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,240
from that perspective in the first place.

230
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,500
Because that's the part that, in modern discourse,

231
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,420
people ignore the most.

232
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,300
They go immediately to the idea of this imagined intent

233
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,260
that any psychologist or economist who disagrees with them

234
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,340
or any kind of feminist-leaning person in the humanities

235
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,500
clearly has this agenda, when the agenda, if anything,

236
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,020
is spelled out already, and you can read it.

237
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,240
And they've clearly ignored that to go,

238
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,540
no, they want to collectivize everything

239
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,780
or whatever it is that they say nowadays.

240
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,620
This isn't the one book you have to read.

241
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,780
But I would basically recommend picking up basic primers

242
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,020
in any of these fields and just reading through them.

243
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,140
This was a fantastic read.

244
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,300
I basically just skipped through it the first time

245
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,420
and just whoever had bought this before me

246
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,980
had done their own markings, so I just read those bits

247
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,140
and checked it out.

248
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,300
It's really informative.

249
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,100
Another book I would recommend while we're doing

250
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,500
basic primers that you would do in a university level

251
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,140
is Literary Theory and Anthology.

252
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,420
It's the first book I got when I was in university.

253
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,100
And I'm just gonna go over to my little bookshelf

254
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,820
that I actually just got in so I can have more stuff,

255
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,100
so I have more stuff on this set.

256
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
What are some good ones?

257
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,220
I'm not a very good educator.

258
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
I can't be like, oh, here's all the stuff

259
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,260
that you need to read first

260
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,980
before gender trouble makes sense.

261
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,820
I don't know.

262
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,580
I don't know what it is.

263
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,340
I didn't understand it until I read it,

264
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,500
and then I did, so if there's some magic other step

265
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,180
that a smarter person would tell you to read first,

266
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,380
I'm sorry, I don't know what it is.

267
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,340
Conquest of Bread is good.

268
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
It's good.

269
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,260
I'm just gonna unequivocally recommend that you read it.

270
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
It's good.

271
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Just have fun.

272
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,420
Pedagogy of the Oppressed is really good as well.

273
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,820
Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex is really good,

274
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,380
and it's big, but it's worth reading,

275
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,300
and it's lots of little chapters,

276
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,020
and each of them has something interesting to say,

277
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,860
and it's cool.

278
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,660
My favorite book of the list of things I've got right now

279
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,780
is Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Jesus and Sadism,

280
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,420
and it's really good because,

281
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,260
well, not this good, actually.

282
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,060
Do not buy this version.

283
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,140
Half, like, all, like, this side of every page

284
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,340
is grayer and harder to read.

285
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,020
Don't buy this version, but I had another version,

286
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,740
and again, like, I just lost a bunch of my old books,

287
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,900
but this is really, really good,

288
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,980
and I think it's that and perhaps some, like,

289
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,020
Zizek books are,

290
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,740
I wouldn't actually recommend any of his books, though,

291
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,700
are the most informative to my perspective

292
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,380
on how I approach a lot of issues, how I think about them,

293
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,020
and they're really good at getting you to question

294
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,540
how you approach an issue in the first place,

295
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,740
which is the thing I wanna stress.

296
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,740
You need to go, like, why am we doing this?

297
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,260
So, like, if you want to talk about these issues

298
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,100
to someone who doesn't understand them,

299
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,220
then the thing that they're probably missing,

300
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,940
first and foremost, is an understanding

301
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,580
of why it's important to approach things

302
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,900
from that perspective or from any perspective

303
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,780
in the first place.

304
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,420
A lot of people, the way they're currently thinking

305
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,060
naturally occurs to them,

306
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,740
and they wouldn't even think to use another approach,

307
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,300
so I think the purpose of a lot of this work

308
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,980
is to sort of plunge you into another perspective

309
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,340
and make you think from it.

310
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,940
A lot of writing on politics is written to be seamless,

311
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,180
to be like, oh, this goes down easy,

312
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,580
and this all makes sense,

313
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,820
and it complements the way I already looked at the world.

314
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,340
Like, all of, I was about to say all of Michael Moore's

315
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,140
books, but I only ever read one of them,

316
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Stupid White Men, I think it's called,

317
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,660
is rubbish because it's so convenient.

318
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,700
Like, it just, it goes down so easy

319
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,340
that you don't actually learn anything from it.

320
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,780
You just go, ah, yes, these people are bad,

321
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,660
whereas I think a lot of the books

322
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,220
that I've just recommended are like,

323
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,020
oh, this is a way of looking at things

324
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,260
that I didn't have before,

325
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,700
and that's, like, more valuable almost.

326
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,860
In a way, I have a better understanding of

327
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,380
and appreciation for left-leaning ideas

328
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,780
because I've read so much right-wing bullshit in my life.

329
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,380
Every major villain in human history

330
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,620
has written a manifesto about why they're doing it.

331
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,460
Read that.

332
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,820
I wish I had a copy of Mein Kampf to hold up and go,

333
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,660
also read this because it's informative

334
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,940
and I think it's important to get the most

335
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,340
accurate understanding of the perspective that informs it,

336
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,140
but I don't actually have a physical copy

337
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,420
with me right now because the one that I recently bought

338
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,940
had to be returned because the text

339
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,340
went all the way into the spine.

340
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,540
It was incredibly poorly published.

341
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Mein Kampf became public domain last year

342
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,140
and now exists in hundreds, if not thousands,

343
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,180
of versions and printings that are rubbish.

344
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,740
Also, by the way, if you're in high school,

345
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,980
do not ask your high school library

346
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,300
to get you a copy of Mein Kampf.

347
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
You will go on a list.

348
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,540
I don't know what's scarier in Mein Kampf,

349
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,340
the fact that you can feel yourself being propagandized,

350
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,980
you can feel yourself being almost convinced

351
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,420
of the thing that he's saying,

352
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
or the part where, you know,

353
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,300
it's just outright racist ideology,

354
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,340
or the bit where there's a bunch of advice in there

355
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,980
for how to act in modern politics that still works,

356
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,460
that's still 100% good advice

357
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,900
for how to be good in politics.

358
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,140
Like, that's scary in its own way.

359
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,620
Like, I'd recommend reading it

360
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,540
if you can stomach that sort of thing.

361
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
That was kind of a bit rambly

362
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,260
and there was a lot of books in there

363
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,460
and they might not even be the best books to start with,

364
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,940
but I hope that helps.

365
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,780
Thanks.

366
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,020
I noticed that you rarely discuss gender, sexuality,

367
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,860
diversity, or other SJW issues

368
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,380
in your non-measured response videos,

369
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,060
e.g. Fallout, Soulsborne, Braid.

370
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,660
The closest thing was talking about Irene

371
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,780
in your Sherlock video.

372
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,380
Is this an intentional choice?

373
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,860
If so, why?

374
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,300
If not, do you think there's a reason

375
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,700
why you keep that shit packed up?

376
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,420
Or is this all in my imagination?

377
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,220
I don't keep them divided on purpose.

378
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,260
I do think that I try and make everything

379
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,100
with the same kind of perspective in mind.

380
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,060
I don't like the idea of there being a break

381
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
in the kinds of content I make.

382
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,580
At the same time, I do think I talk quite a lot

383
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,900
about the ideas

384
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,660
and what they might mean for us as players

385
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,580
in games quite often.

386
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,380
Like, Dark Souls 2, I think,

387
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,740
has something really interesting to say

388
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,660
about its world, but more importantly,

389
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,580
about our world and how to live in it.

390
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,140
How do you live in a world

391
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,300
where you might not actually,

392
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,780
basically, have ever existed

393
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,620
because you'll die and be so completely forgotten

394
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,740
that it doesn't even matter?

395
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,540
Like, how do you act in a world

396
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,380
where that can happen?

397
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,020
I think it asks really interesting questions.

398
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,580
I don't like turning that kind of work

399
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,220
into a manifesto where I go,

400
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,380
oh, no, this is what this means

401
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,780
and this is how we have to live our lives

402
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,580
based on Dark Souls 2 telling us,

403
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,420
you know, I could do that,

404
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,060
but I have this, I guess the term is,

405
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,900
I guess I want to avoid being preachy,

406
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,500
and I think people are very quick

407
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,020
to dismiss people as preachy

408
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,620
if they just don't like what they have to say,

409
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,980
but I also want to avoid being it.

410
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,700
Some of the stuff that I'm working on right now,

411
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,980
especially the Deus Ex Human Revolution video,

412
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,500
which is the current long project I'm working on,

413
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,980
I always have a long project,

414
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,940
does deal quite a lot with social topics

415
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,900
and the points,

416
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,460
and I guess it'll be my most SJW game analysis

417
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,580
just because it comes up more

418
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,100
because it's a game that prizes itself

419
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,300
so much more on story than Fallout 3

420
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,980
or the Souls games do.

421
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,780
In fact, they pride themselves on not having as much.

422
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,140
Are you single?

423
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,020
No, sorry.

424
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,740
Do you think that it's possible to be friends

425
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,980
with people who exhibit alt-right traits?

426
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,100
Is it possible to overlook such negative qualities?

427
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,860
That is a cracking question.

428
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,700
It's possible.

429
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,300
I know people who are like,

430
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,380
oh, I don't believe any of this,

431
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,180
but I can be friends with them, that's fine,

432
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,580
but they're usually people who don't have anything to lose

433
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,620
from the views of those people.

434
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,900
You know, if you want to,

435
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,860
let's take the most shitty definition of alt-right,

436
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,940
you know, like they want to build a white ethnostate.

437
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,660
Usually it's easy to be friends with those people

438
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,540
if you're white.

439
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,540
For me personally,

440
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,340
it's not possible to be friends with people

441
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,780
who exhibit really far-right beliefs.

442
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,540
Either I immediately start arguing with them

443
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,380
and, you know, there is no friendship,

444
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,620
or I sort of consciously remember

445
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,300
some of the shitty things they say

446
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,700
and just think less about

447
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,980
wanting to hang out with them again.

448
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,140
I have a friend who sort of shifted further right

449
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,340
in the last couple of years,

450
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,820
and I just stopped talking to him.

451
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,060
Like, not on purpose,

452
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,580
I didn't deliberately blank him or anything,

453
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,180
I'm not that sort of person,

454
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,380
but I just thought less and less

455
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,220
about that person in my life.

456
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,980
And that's just kind of how people are, I think.

457
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,940
I think there are probably people

458
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,900
who have thought less about hanging out with me

459
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,300
because of my far-left beliefs, you know?

460
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,700
That's just kind of how things work, isn't it?

461
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,140
Did you build your computer yourself

462
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,500
or pay to have one custom-built?

463
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,580
The first computer I ever had was custom-built

464
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
by this guy called Jed,

465
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,380
who I really looked up to and thought was cool.

466
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,700
So I was like, after this, I'm gonna build my own.

467
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,740
And then I bought an iMac and I used that for years.

468
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,860
But then I realized that I liked PC games

469
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,820
more than I liked having a slightly nicer version

470
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,740
of Photoshop, and eventually I built a PC

471
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,580
that could actually play games, and it was great.

472
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
And I've built my own PCs ever since.

473
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,260
What's your advice on long-distance relationships?

474
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,220
Oh, fuck.

475
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,820
You know, like in a lot of relationships

476
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,780
where you see the person every day,

477
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,580
you can get into this routine

478
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,420
where it just becomes normal to hang around with that person

479
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,580
and that's nice.

480
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
But I think if you're in a relationship

481
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,660
where you don't see each other as much,

482
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,060
it's important to make the times you are together

483
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,180
really special and feel really important.

484
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
You basically have to have a better relationship

485
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,380
in a shorter amount of time.

486
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,060
So make sure that you do that in whatever way you see fit,

487
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,620
because I don't know what that way is.

488
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,300
What color is your toothbrush?

489
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,780
It's blue and white.

490
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,500
How did you support yourself financially

491
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,940
before you were drafted into the culture war?

492
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,340
Okay, for about six months before I started making videos,

493
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,020
I was an IT engineer, and then I realized

494
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,220
that they were underpaying me

495
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,820
because they could get away with it.

496
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,900
So I quit and I started doing animations

497
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,460
for the School of Life on their YouTube channel,

498
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,580
which was fun.

499
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,100
And then I realized that that video I'd made

500
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,740
like a year ago by that point had done really well

501
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,060
and I could probably have made more

502
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,220
because the audience actually existed

503
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,300
despite me assuming it didn't for quite a while.

504
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,380
So then I just started making stuff in my spare time

505
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,980
while I was finding more work.

506
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,140
And then I stopped having to find more work

507
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
and it was really cool.

508
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,740
So that was that.

509
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,620
Prior to that, I had just got out of university

510
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,100
and I worked in a chip shop while I was at uni

511
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,580
for a couple of weeks and then I quit

512
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,620
and then the place got closed because of rats.

513
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,740
Have you ever played the LucasArts Adventures?

514
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,700
Not really.

515
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,740
I've heard they're really good

516
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,300
and I have no reason to disagree

517
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,860
because what I have played of them is good,

518
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,980
but I've never finished one or played it for that long

519
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,700
apart from the first Monkey Island.

520
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,220
I'm really more into the kind of weird adventure games

521
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,460
where you can die easily and they were made

522
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,500
with a very precise sense of humor

523
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,060
or they were just like shoddily put together.

524
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,020
Like there's something fun about playing bad

525
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,980
point and click adventure games.

526
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,020
So those are the ones that I've sought after as a child.

527
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,820
I was absolutely in love with Shadow of the Comet

528
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,340
and Prisoner of Ice growing up.

529
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,260
They're just fantastically,

530
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,980
just like not that great games,

531
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,060
but they're just fun enough that you do wanna keep playing

532
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,740
and you wanna know how the story ends

533
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,220
and you also want to experience the horror

534
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,500
of the game breaking or not working properly

535
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,380
or something that you never thought you had to do

536
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,460
hours before killing you.

537
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,660
Like they're that kind of school of game.

538
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,260
There's a fantastic part and I think it's Prisoner of Ice

539
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,460
where you're supposed to be looking around for an exit

540
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,420
and you're just off the screen

541
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,260
and there's nothing on the screen

542
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,980
that you can find to be going

543
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,820
where we're supposed to be going.

544
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,860
There's nothing there.

545
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,980
You walk the character off screen

546
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,420
and the character comes back and says,

547
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,020
there's more stuff here.

548
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,340
The camera turns and there's more stuff.

549
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,060
Like the game hits a point where it's just fucking with you

550
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,700
just like to see how much it can make you play.

551
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,820
And by the end,

552
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,980
you get a choice of two endings in Prisoner of Ice

553
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,460
and they're both basically the same

554
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,140
and they both end with the same cut scene

555
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,620
after this little bit in the middle.

556
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,540
And it's like, they were just testing to see

557
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,300
if I would bother getting to the end

558
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,740
and I lost by doing it.

559
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,340
Like I failed the test.

560
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,900
So those are the kind of games I got really into

561
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,220
instead of the LucasArts ones,

562
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,020
which always seemed kind of well-made and polished

563
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,500
and that just wasn't my style.

564
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,220
I actually think I own one of the few physical copies

565
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,820
of Limbo of the Lost,

566
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,740
which is a point-and-click adventure game

567
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,180
I'm gonna do a video about at some point.

568
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,540
I wanna do a video series about obscure games

569
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,460
not many people know about.

570
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,420
Limbo of the Lost is one of them.

571
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,060
It's a point-and-click adventure game

572
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,900
with assets just stolen from Oblivion

573
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,500
and Morrowind and Enclave and a bunch of other games.

574
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
And they just sold it.

575
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,140
Like people paid money to buy this game

576
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,580
and it's like basically theft.

577
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,180
I'd love to do a thing just looking at it

578
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
because it's also, alongside that,

579
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,820
before I found out all of that

580
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,580
and also then checked and found more myself,

581
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,220
that it's just such a bad game in so many ways

582
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,940
that it might be a game I played the most in my life

583
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,300
just to inspect it.

584
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,340
Sometimes you play games to sort of understand

585
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,180
why they were made

586
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,140
and a lot of bad point-and-click adventure games

587
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,220
do that better than any other game genre.

588
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,660
So it also means I missed out on a lot of the good ones.

589
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,420
So at some point I wanna go back

590
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,420
and play more of those,

591
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,900
but instead I'm more of the like kind of weird French ones,

592
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,460
the illegal ones,

593
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,700
and also really like some of the King's Quests

594
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,540
are really good.

595
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,580
Police Quest, Space Quest.

596
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
God, there's a lot of quests I just realized now finally

597
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,460
after all these years.

598
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,500
Gabriel Knight as well.

599
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,780
All through the Gabriel Knight games,

600
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,500
I like these obscene...

601
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
The first one's all right.

602
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,980
Like it's nice art.

603
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,300
The puzzles mostly make sense.

604
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,060
And then Gabriel Knight 2 and 3,

605
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,580
are just these like bizarro nightmares

606
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,780
that don't make any sense.

607
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,300
I mean, everyone kind of at this point knows

608
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,980
the cat hair mustache puzzle from the third game.

609
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,500
Imagine like me as a child

610
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,020
trying to like having to look that up

611
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,860
and going, why would you do this?

612
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,940
And it turned out that that was put in by producers

613
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,380
or something like they requested

614
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,540
some particularly hard puzzle for some reason.

615
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,380
I think it might be to sell strategy guides or something.

616
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,420
Hey, I recently rewatched your Undertale vid.

617
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Any chance we could see a video about your disagreements

618
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,180
with the ideological implications of the game theorists,

619
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,020
even if it's just a short patron only vid for instance.

620
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,300
This question was asked in June

621
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,740
before the Lisa video came out

622
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,860
where I kind of do cover some of this, but no.

623
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,540
I also kind of liked leaving it

624
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,420
and that kind of vague comment and then moving on.

625
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,820
There's something funny about not fully explaining it.

626
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,060
But basically I think they reflect a perspective

627
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,060
that is sort of unhealthy to have about games

628
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,740
where you kind of inspect them for canon.

629
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,500
I think it's almost a crime to think wrong about games.

630
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,860
So game theorists are bad.

631
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,620
You know, for me, the fun of Sans

632
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,220
was that he's this kind of silly weirdo

633
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,580
who's clearly hiding something.

634
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,140
And finding out what that is

635
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,060
and getting this explanation during a fight

636
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,780
if you choose to play the game a certain way is really fun.

637
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,500
And I kind of think it almost takes away from that

638
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,580
for someone to go, ah, yes,

639
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,860
but I've gone over it with a fine tooth comb

640
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,660
and trying to piece together the comprehensive story.

641
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,940
Like, whatever story you turn up isn't as interesting

642
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,580
as the story you experience just playing it normally.

643
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,900
Um, that's, uh, it's, eh.

644
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,460
What's your guide to consuming inhuman quantities of media?

645
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,260
You seem to have seen slash read like fucking everything

646
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,540
while I take weeks to watch

647
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,500
like a single fucking season of a series.

648
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,020
Uh, I also do that.

649
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,340
I'm still partway through Recreators,

650
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,220
which is an anime I really like,

651
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,020
and I just stopped and haven't seen it again for a while.

652
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
And I don't know why I do that.

653
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,100
I do that with tons of shows that I really like.

654
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,180
I love Kino's Journey, and I still haven't seen,

655
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,700
I think, either of the Kino's Journey movies that exist.

656
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,060
And, like, why did I, why have I not done that?

657
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,340
That's stupid.

658
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
I have the same problem.

659
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,500
I just, uh, but the trick is to, uh,

660
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,060
watch things and remember the contents of them

661
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,540
as much as possible so that you then

662
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,380
can just call them back anytime.

663
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,540
Like, I'm 25.

664
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,660
I've had 25 years of consuming media.

665
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,980
I've seen, you know, all of the episodes of The Simpsons

666
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,820
that were out when I was, uh, 14.

667
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,700
I'd seen all of them because they were what I watched

668
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,020
as a kid, so, like, I have, like,

669
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,100
access to every event from, you know,

670
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,260
every quote from The Simpsons from those seasons

671
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,340
is just there in my head somewhere.

672
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,980
Just try and remember the things that you watch,

673
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,380
and you'll eventually have this huge backlog to refer to.

674
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,860
I don't watch that much stuff.

675
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,500
I still don't even watch the things that I like.

676
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,060
I make videos about games quite a lot now

677
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
for a living, basically.

678
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,300
I don't actually play that many games anymore

679
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,420
because making videos is so time-consuming.

680
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,180
Have you thought of doing a general election video?

681
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,220
It would be cool to see your political positions.

682
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,740
However, I can see how this might be divisive.

683
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,020
This question was made on the 1st of June,

684
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,660
and my answer to that question was,

685
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,900
oh, that's a good idea, and then I made a video about it.

686
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,140
So thank you, whoever asked that question,

687
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,700
for giving me the idea to make a video that

688
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,820
ended up doing quite well.

689
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,860
So I also want to do more political-type stuff

690
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,620
in the future along those lines, so thank you

691
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,460
for asking this question and changing

692
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,580
the future of my YouTube channel forever, whoever that was.

693
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,700
So I guess my answer to that question is thanks.

694
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,180
Does that count as an answer?

695
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,260
Do you feel that people are naturally good and made bad

696
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,780
by their environment, naturally bad and made

697
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,900
good by their environment, good is spelt with an I,

698
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,780
or blank slates entirely shaped by their environment?

699
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,340
I think that people don't have a nature.

700
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,020
I think that humans, if they have one key thing that keeps

701
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,620
happening is they change a lot.

702
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,660
Everything is always different with humans.

703
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,980
If you look at things from any measurement of distance

704
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,620
or time, we behave radically differently,

705
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,780
given just a couple of years or generations.

706
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,380
And the English language itself has altered radically

707
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,420
in the last few hundred years, and it kept changing.

708
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,820
So there are just periods of history

709
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,340
where if you move this person here,

710
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,180
you couldn't even understand them.

711
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,780
And from that perspective, of course our behavior

712
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,660
is going to change a lot, because the society

713
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,220
that we're in has a huge impact on it.

714
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,900
But because humans build society,

715
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
obviously it's not something we're completely

716
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,140
unable to control.

717
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,500
To a certain extent, no one's really in control of anything

718
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,980
and no one's to blame for any crimes.

719
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,100
Basically, the answer is it's too complicated

720
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,100
for anyone to understand, and we're in big trouble.

721
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,180
What do you think about Homestuck, if you've read it?

722
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,900
I've never read Homestuck, and I might never get around

723
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,020
to it, but I probably should at some point.

724
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,020
It looks okay, and everyone who talks about it

725
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,180
is very opinionated about it in some direction

726
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,780
or the other, and wow.

727
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,580
There's a picture going around of me and a friend

728
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,580
being yaoi'd, a woman drew us in an embrace,

729
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,500
and someone else drew a version of that

730
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,460
where we were Homestuck characters.

731
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,220
That's the most interaction I've had ever with Homestuck,

732
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,500
and I plan on reading it, but eventually.

733
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,820
I have no solid plans.

734
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,860
I might eventually read it, and I'm sure I'll love it.

735
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,980
That was a joke.

736
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,740
Any thoughts on the Dishonored series?

737
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,300
Dishonored series is really good.

738
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,140
It's really good.

739
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,980
It's really well made.

740
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,260
It's a really good immersive sim.

741
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,500
I was absolutely amazed by the level of just control

742
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,180
that you have over outcomes of encounters.

743
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,660
Like, I was kind of starved for games where you can just go,

744
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,860
oh, this person lives from this encounter,

745
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,660
and they come back, and it actually impacts the story,

746
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,740
even if it's just a little tiny way, it's good.

747
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,720
I really like the Dishonored series.

748
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,980
I haven't played the newest thing, Death of the Outsider.

749
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,140
I hope it's good.

750
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,260
I might actually do a thing on the Dishonored series

751
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,100
now I think about it.

752
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,700
Like, there's a lot to say, actually,

753
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,340
about the complexity of its design.

754
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,620
I probably should've thought to do that earlier.

755
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,300
Thanks, Question Asker, for reminding me

756
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,580
of a video I should make.

757
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,940
This question comes from Justin Partridge on Patreon.

758
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,860
Are you reading any new comics regularly?

759
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,740
Like, do you have a pull box somewhere?

760
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,260
I don't read that many new comics.

761
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,340
I tend to wait until the comic is done,

762
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,660
and then I can just read the whole thing through.

763
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,860
So I'm really looking forward to Black Panther, Black Bolt.

764
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,540
Those both sound really, really cool,

765
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,220
and I like the bits of them that I've seen.

766
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,440
I'd like to read them in full,

767
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,380
but I don't tend to read that many new comics.

768
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,940
And I also stopped reading web comics, like, regularly.

769
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,660
I started just going, oh, wait, six months or two years.

770
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,020
I mean, a huge burst.

771
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,260
I did that with Gunnakrig Court.

772
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,300
I read all of it, like, immediately

773
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,460
when I first heard about it,

774
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,500
and then I waited, like, four years

775
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,660
and then read all of it again.

776
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,860
It was great, and now I'm waiting again.

777
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,220
Max S. on Patreon asks,

778
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,580
does asking if you're going to do

779
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,100
a Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines video count as an ask?

780
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,180
Because I know you said you were going to do a New Vegas one,

781
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,780
and those are both in your Fallout 3 list.

782
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,420
Yes, I am eventually going to do it.

783
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,860
I actually have a specific idea for this in mind.

784
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,300
The best video essayist on YouTube bar none,

785
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,660
Noah Caldwell-Gervais, did a video

786
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,340
covering two of the games that Troika made,

787
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,820
and he says that Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines

788
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,060
doesn't hold up like he remembered it,

789
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,140
and it's actually quite bad in a lot of ways,

790
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,980
and that sounded like blasphemy,

791
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,300
but now I'm worried that he's right,

792
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,540
because, like, he's right about a lot of things,

793
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,660
so I'm probably going to do a video directed at him

794
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,860
where I specifically go, oh, yeah,

795
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,660
and go through it and see if he's right.

796
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,420
I think that'd be a really interesting video to try doing,

797
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,860
so, um, who knows?

798
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,140
Like, I haven't played it in quite a while,

799
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,220
and I remember really liking it

800
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,660
and thinking it was really good.

801
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,940
Am I going to have to, like,

802
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,820
retroactively apologize for that list

803
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,100
and go, like, ah, no, one of these was bad?

804
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,420
Like, that's a really cool video to make, actually.

805
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,700
I should make that sooner than I expected to.

806
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,220
This one comes from Alex Scranton on Patreon.

807
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,980
Who or what inspired you to toss your hat

808
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,260
into the fuckery of the YouTube gaming ring?

809
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,100
Were you always just interested in the criticism side,

810
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,340
or did you start by watching LPs or something else,

811
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,700
and what content creator would you say inspired you the most?

812
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,740
In terms of video game-related content,

813
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,100
there isn't much, but I really liked the tone

814
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,340
set by the people at Shut Up and Sit Down.

815
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,060
They've been doing board game reviews for years,

816
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,460
and even their earliest stuff

817
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,500
is just, like, really funny and well put together,

818
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,340
and I think that was the most directly inspirational

819
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,380
in terms of the idea that you could make this stuff.

820
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,020
I don't think I have any specific inspirations

821
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,500
in terms of the kinds of content I make myself, though.

822
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,420
I think it came from more of a place of realizing

823
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,100
that people have emotional responses to things

824
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,220
that they don't understand.

825
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,900
You know, like, I didn't enjoy Fallout 3

826
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,620
for a lot of reasons that I couldn't really articulate

827
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,100
when someone asked me why.

828
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,060
I think a lot of my videos are basically me

829
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,420
trying to kind of, like, explain why I felt the way

830
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,900
that I did in the first place.

831
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,300
It's kind of, like, taking steps backwards

832
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,780
from the visceral experience of playing the game,

833
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,140
if that makes sense.

834
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,900
Since you're pretty much the only famous

835
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,420
No Man's Sky apologist,

836
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,660
you should do a retrospective video

837
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,100
on the things they've changed to the game

838
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,420
and how they impact the vision of the game

839
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,740
as it was released, and really,

840
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,100
whose fault is it that Hello Games

841
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,980
ended up having such a terrible reputation?

842
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,700
Spoilers, it's Sony's fault.

843
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,660
Um, as someone who really liked specifically

844
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,380
what No Man's Sky was when it came out,

845
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,500
the fact they've changed it to be a lot more like the game

846
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,900
they apparently promised to people

847
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,740
I didn't pay attention to the marketing,

848
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,540
um, worries me a little bit.

849
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,820
I'm worried I'm gonna go back to it,

850
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,540
and it's not gonna actually be the thing that I enjoyed,

851
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,420
but if more people can be happy with the game it is now,

852
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,180
then good for them, I suppose.

853
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,500
No Man's Sky is a game that released in early access,

854
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,940
but they didn't tell anyone

855
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,220
that it released in early access,

856
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,460
which is a bold new strategy,

857
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,300
but also probably illegal.

858
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,140
Um, they probably should have just said,

859
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,660
it's gonna be, it's early access.

860
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,220
They could have just done that.

861
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,380
I'm not the biggest fan of early access as a business model,

862
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,260
but it would have made it a lot more.

863
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,340
At the same time, I appreciated the goal

864
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,740
of releasing a finished game that was empty and lonely.

865
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,580
I loved that.

866
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,980
Are you still developing that game?

867
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,020
Yes, I am spending ages on it.

868
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,540
I'd originally planned for it to be a challenge

869
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,140
where I do all of the writing and animation

870
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,060
and art and programming and music,

871
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,940
and then I slowly kind of realized

872
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,060
that I can't do all of that

873
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,700
because I'm rubbish at most of it.

874
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,460
So I should hire on people who can do all those things

875
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,460
and try and at least make it ever exist.

876
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,340
So a good portion of the last couple of months

877
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,860
has been me figuring out what parts of the game

878
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,740
I actually am comfortable with it being me making

879
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,420
and what parts I feel like I should outsource

880
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,660
to other people.

881
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,220
I'm now at the point where I'm explaining the idea

882
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,140
and the concepts I want to use in the game to other people.

883
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,980
And that's cool,

884
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,100
because it's kind of letting other people in

885
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,260
on the ideas that I've had

886
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,980
and finding out which ones are ridiculous

887
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
and I shouldn't be using

888
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,580
and just don't make sense to everyone else

889
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,380
and which parts actually do make some sense.

890
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,780
And also being forced to elevate a pitch your game

891
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,780
or describe it to someone else who has to weigh in on it.

892
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,580
I honestly think that collaboration between people

893
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,700
and having to explain yourselves to more people in a group

894
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,980
is more valuable than being one person

895
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,380
who spends years saving away

896
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,180
with a perfect vision or whatever.

897
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,900
I guess the answer is yes, I'm still developing that game,

898
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,100
but eventually it will be more than me

899
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,620
and maybe one day it'll exist

900
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,300
and I hope it's good because I've spent so long on it.

901
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,380
What is your favorite Blind Guardian album?

902
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
Night at the Opera, no question.

903
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,460
I even wrote Night at the Opera, no question on this.

904
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,980
It's the best full album.

905
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,180
I really like some of the songs on Wheel of Time

906
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,700
and Twisting the Myth,

907
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,740
but Night at the Opera is the whole package.

908
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,940
It's all good.

909
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,140
And yes, I did discover Blind Guardian

910
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,020
through the Robot Unicorn Attack heavy metal version.

911
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,380
I'm basically a cultural void.

912
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,100
That's all the questions that I could be bothered to answer.

913
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,580
Thank you all very much for watching.

914
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,020
You can reach me on Curious Cat

915
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,620
and I'll respond if I think it'll be interesting to do

916
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,580
and I won't make a fool of myself.

917
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,500
I might keep some back for a future video.

918
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,220
I kind of wanted to do a 150,000 subscriber one as well

919
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,340
and then I passed the 150,000 mark

920
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,780
while I was waiting for the plaque to arrive to do this one.

921
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,380
So I might eventually just do a 150,000 subscriber special

922
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,820
when I hit a different milestone,

923
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,620
so I'm always just a little bit staggered behind.

924
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,980
That might be a funny joke.

925
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,780
I'm also kind of thinking of just doing Q&A stuff

926
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,820
more often for backers.

927
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,300
I want to do a thing where, like,

928
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,860
people who back me a certain amount ask a question

929
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
and then I'll do a video answering them

930
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,060
and it'll be a nice, fun time.

931
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,980
I kind of want to do these kinds of videos more often.

932
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,940
I kind of am actually, you can probably tell,

933
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,340
I'm building a set and when it's finished

934
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,900
and also when it's warm because in the winter

935
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,540
it's freezing in here, I'm going to stream from here

936
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,740
and I'd love to do, like, Q&A streams from here

937
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,580
every now and then where I answer questions

938
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,740
asked by patrons, so let me know what you think of that.

939
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,300
I didn't write an ending for this video.

940
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
Bye.

941
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,700
Bye.
