0	3080	Hello, I'm not legendary game designer Lorne Lanning,
3080	5660	so I don't know why you're wasting your time here.
5660	7160	But, hey, while I've got you,
7160	10660	I recently passed 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.com,
10660	13200	and after three months and one official complaint
13200	14500	to YouTube management,
14500	16540	my plaque finally arrived to confirm it.
16540	18420	Anyway, it seems to be customary for YouTubers
18420	20160	to do some sort of Q&A video
20160	22160	when they hit a certain amount of subscribers,
22160	23660	and I love answering questions.
23660	25620	I love discussing stuff.
25620	27780	Uh, so I really felt like I should do one of those.
27820	29360	I put out a thing, uh, months ago
29360	31100	asking people to provide questions
31100	33100	that they thought would be good for this sort of thing,
33100	34940	and I also held back a couple of questions
34940	35900	that I got on Curious Cat
35900	37640	I thought would be worth answering on video.
37640	41400	So, uh, we're gonna do that now.
41400	42780	How old are you?
42780	45780	Okay, I actually, um, made, like, little bits of notes
45780	47440	next to some of the questions that I thought,
47440	49780	oh, I might forget this when I'm actually recording it,
49780	51860	and for some reason, in brackets, I put,
51860	53780	it's 25 here.
53780	56140	I'm not really sure why I did that.
56220	58760	I must have very low expectations of myself.
58760	61680	Anyway, yeah, I'm 25.
61680	67500	I've kind of looked like I was 14 for most of my life.
67500	70580	My hairline has always been this far receded,
70580	71920	so you can't make fun of it
71920	73540	because I'm comfortable with this.
73540	77260	I fully expect to go bald within the next three to six months.
77260	78620	I can't wait, to be honest.
78620	81460	You know, I've never really cared about my appearance,
81460	85500	as you can tell from just the way I dress and look.
85540	87740	You can't let yourself care about your appearance
87740	90500	when you look like me. It would destroy me.
90500	92200	So I've always kind of just messed with my hair.
92200	96000	I've always kind of grown it out super long for no reason
96000	99580	and then shaved it all off just to see what would happen.
99580	102700	Usually, it's looked rubbish, but I've never really cared.
102700	108540	One time, I dyed my hair, like, really, really yellowy blonde
108540	112740	for a video that I ended up deciding wasn't worth making,
112740	115240	and the time for it has passed.
115240	120860	It was a music video starring me as Milo Yiannopoulos.
120860	123640	It's probably the most extravagant thing I'd ever done,
123640	126860	and I dyed my hair for it, and it had to grow out,
126860	131480	so it was like eight months of awful hair
131480	133820	for a piece that I decided to not make.
133820	136360	So if you're wondering why my hair was awful
136360	140600	for a long stretch of last year and this year, that was why.
140600	142240	I actually made it with two other friends.
142240	144100	One of them was the musician who composed a bunch of it,
144100	145380	and the other one sort of helped out on set
145380	147380	when we were shooting it,
147380	149340	and that guy also had a camcorder
149340	151560	and was filming the whole process,
151560	153640	including me dyeing my hair, so there's, like, a good...
153640	156760	There's a good two-hour rubbish documentary
156760	160380	about the hijinks that we got up to attempting
160380	162600	to make this thing that I ended up never finishing.
162600	164800	It looks like it's working.
164800	165800	I can feel something happening,
165800	168800	but I can also see my skin getting kind of reddish.
168800	170300	Maybe I should edit that together for patrons.
170300	171720	That would be a fun thing to do. Let me know.
171720	173560	Anyway, I'm done hijacking that question
173560	175260	and to ramble about my hair now, so let's move on.
175260	179060	What's your favorite piece of fan fiction of any kind ever?
179060	181420	You specified of any kind,
181420	183340	which means I get to take wild leaps,
183340	184920	so nice one there.
184920	188680	My personal favorite fan fiction ever
188680	191800	is a film that came out in 2014 called The Guest.
191800	193060	The Guest is really, really good, by the way.
193060	194640	You should watch it. It's really, really good.
194640	197760	Dan Stevens, amazing in it.
197760	199520	British people represent.
199520	202220	That film is very clearly
202220	205600	Chris Evans-era
205600	207300	Captain America fan fiction.
207300	210440	It is very deliberately a guy on the run
210440	214220	from a S.H.I.E.L.D.-style organization
214220	217440	trying to be a good person, live his own life in a world
217440	220440	that no longer suits him.
220440	222220	The serial numbers have been filed off,
222220	224800	but there is a very clear S.H.I.E.L.D.-type organization.
224800	226680	I mean, it might not actually be at all.
226680	229180	There might not have been anyone's plan whatsoever,
229220	230680	and I've just read into the film.
230680	232300	It wouldn't be the first time,
232300	235600	but for me, it's just a really, really good film,
235600	237300	and it has enough little things in there
237300	240220	that it qualifies as this kind of rumination
240220	242600	on the kind of super soldier
242600	244920	that Captain America is in the more recent films,
244920	246680	and I think that's kind of interesting.
246680	247880	It's also just a really good film.
247880	250180	I am now, however, going to give my favorite fan fiction
250180	252220	that's an actual fan fiction
252220	255220	so that I've actually answered the question properly.
255220	257500	As for my favorite piece of actual fan fiction,
257500	259040	you have to go with My Immortal.
259040	260820	It's really funny.
260820	265280	It's definitely a parody of other fan fictions
265280	268360	and the fights that happen when people collaborate on them.
268360	270440	It's definitely a parody.
270440	273980	I—if you don't agree that's a lie, it's not true.
273980	275200	I'll see you in hell.
275200	277360	It's—it's good, and it's funny.
277360	279160	This next one's a long one.
279160	280400	Great.
280400	282660	Could you recommend some good social sciences literature
282660	284200	for beginners or other literature
284200	285820	that has influenced you the most?
285820	287240	I'd love to be as articulate and good
287240	288780	at critical thinking as you.
288820	289980	That won't be too hard.
289980	291680	Many of my acquaintances are right-leaning
291680	294400	and pretty racist, sexist, homophobic, et cetera.
294400	295900	Still, I feel like I could easily give them
295900	297740	a bit of perspective if I only had enough knowledge
297740	299140	and good argumentative skills.
299140	301220	People have asked me for reading lists quite often.
301220	303480	This is kind of a question that I held back
303480	305720	because it's emblematic of a lot of questions I get.
305720	307020	If I were to come up with, like, a list,
307020	308640	it would just be just a lot of books
308640	310020	from a variety of different categories
310020	312020	because quite often something really simple
312020	314520	that isn't really about any particular issue
314520	316320	informs your perspective a lot,
316360	319020	even though it's not even covering it.
319020	322680	So rather than, like, just give you a list
322680	324640	of all the books I happen to have read
324640	328100	or pretend that I'm educated enough
328100	330400	to know how to construct a reading list for someone else,
330400	333560	I'm just gonna give some general broad strokes
334400	338280	sort of recommendations for how to educate yourself
338280	339860	and then give some actual recommendations.
339860	341560	So I think I would first recommend
341560	343820	looking at the basic ideas
343820	345720	that underlie any particular social science.
345720	349220	So, like, psychology, sociology,
349220	351620	the other humanities, you know, the rest,
351620	352760	whatever you want to call them,
352760	356580	they exist for a reason to study a specific thing
356580	358960	and they usually have some kind of specific goal in mind.
358960	363200	So, like, psychology is the study of human behavior
363200	365200	but also has the kind of goal
365200	368120	of making people more healthy.
368120	370200	I once read this little tiny book
370200	371440	from years and years and years ago,
371440	372280	it was really old,
372280	374500	called Psychoanalysis for Normal People
374500	376980	and it opened with a statement that said,
376980	378180	what's the effect of,
378180	379740	the purpose of psychoanalysis
379740	383300	is to make you ready for anything, something like that.
383300	385020	That, to me, was this sort of,
385020	387220	aha, you know, this is why we do this.
387220	389940	It's not just, ah, we're checking to see what would happen
389940	391820	if you lock people up in a fake prison.
391820	394580	It's we're trying to learn how we behave
394580	397780	in different contexts so that we can better understand
397780	401140	contexts we can create that enhance human behavior.
401140	403400	You know, can we educate ourselves out
403440	405280	of certain behaviors that we exhibit?
406200	407760	I'd basically recommend you go to the source,
407760	411160	look up the reasoning behind why a field of study exists.
411160	414800	Like, why do people do psychiatry or psychology
414800	417280	or sociology or any of the other humanities?
417280	419400	Why, what is its purpose?
419400	420600	What is it looking at?
420600	422720	And what are its methodologies?
422720	425020	And why is it beneficial to use them?
425020	426880	I think a lot of people lack the sort of
426880	429480	base level understanding of what it does and why
429480	431840	that makes the whole thing make sense.
431840	434360	So I don't think, I'm not sure if I have it anywhere,
434360	437280	but when I was in my third year of university,
437280	439680	I was doing an English and film degree,
439680	441520	so I had lots of free time.
441520	445760	I actually just started buying science and sociology books
445760	449720	off of people who were doing either like a master's
449720	452000	or were finishing and were selling their books.
452000	454520	So I could just, out of interest, read what they were like.
454520	456480	And that was kind of a, I guess, a flashpoint
456480	458000	for my own understanding of these concepts,
458000	461520	was bothering to just pick up a basic book on it and read it.
462200	463720	In fact, I'm going to look for it now.
463720	466000	Carry my portable recorder with me.
467320	469400	I keep a bunch of books back here,
470360	474580	and I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure my old applied,
475760	478360	my old applied psychology book is here somewhere.
478360	480520	I literally just like, there was a girl
480520	483240	who was just finishing a master's and she was leaving,
483240	485840	and she was selling all of the books that she bought
486760	488440	because they're expensive.
488440	491080	So people want to buy them used.
491920	493440	Ah, the set is too big.
493440	494920	It's in the way of my library.
496300	500200	So they just started selling all the books.
500200	503440	And here we are, I found it.
503440	508440	It's next to my Call of Cthulhu third edition book.
508560	510240	Well, I don't know what edition is actually.
510240	513200	And also my collected works of George Orwell.
513200	517060	This is why I don't have much of a system for this library.
517100	522100	Ah, so this was the book that I,
522340	525500	this was the book that I bought just for the fun of it.
525500	527300	One of these, I have a couple others
527300	528820	that I got off different people.
528820	533060	And they're just books where they're basically
533060	535500	just a primer on what the issue is.
535500	537960	The most interesting part of the book for me,
537960	539300	as someone who wasn't as interested
539300	541700	in the social sciences at the time,
541700	544340	was the preface, the introduction,
544340	548020	and the, yeah, like, this was it.
548020	550420	This was the eye-opening moment.
550420	555340	1.1 of the introduction, what is applied psychology?
555340	557860	Like, it opens by explaining what it is
557860	561300	and what it's for and why you would care.
561300	563340	And that's the most important part of these books,
563340	566580	in my opinion, is explaining why it's valuable,
566580	569620	why you would use it, and the purpose of approaching things
569620	571240	from that perspective in the first place.
571240	573500	Because that's the part that, in modern discourse,
573500	576420	people ignore the most.
576420	580300	They go immediately to the idea of this imagined intent
580300	585260	that any psychologist or economist who disagrees with them
585260	589340	or any kind of feminist-leaning person in the humanities
589340	592500	clearly has this agenda, when the agenda, if anything,
592500	595020	is spelled out already, and you can read it.
595020	596240	And they've clearly ignored that to go,
596240	599540	no, they want to collectivize everything
599540	601780	or whatever it is that they say nowadays.
601780	604620	This isn't the one book you have to read.
604620	608780	But I would basically recommend picking up basic primers
608780	612020	in any of these fields and just reading through them.
612020	614140	This was a fantastic read.
614140	616300	I basically just skipped through it the first time
616300	619420	and just whoever had bought this before me
619420	622980	had done their own markings, so I just read those bits
622980	624140	and checked it out.
624140	625300	It's really informative.
625300	628100	Another book I would recommend while we're doing
628100	630500	basic primers that you would do in a university level
630500	632140	is Literary Theory and Anthology.
632140	634420	It's the first book I got when I was in university.
634420	638100	And I'm just gonna go over to my little bookshelf
638100	641820	that I actually just got in so I can have more stuff,
641820	644100	so I have more stuff on this set.
644100	645300	What are some good ones?
648500	650220	I'm not a very good educator.
650220	652220	I can't be like, oh, here's all the stuff
652220	653260	that you need to read first
653260	655980	before gender trouble makes sense.
655980	656820	I don't know.
656820	658580	I don't know what it is.
658580	660340	I didn't understand it until I read it,
661180	663500	and then I did, so if there's some magic other step
663500	666180	that a smarter person would tell you to read first,
666180	668380	I'm sorry, I don't know what it is.
668380	670340	Conquest of Bread is good.
670340	671180	It's good.
671180	673260	I'm just gonna unequivocally recommend that you read it.
673260	674100	It's good.
674100	676300	Just have fun.
676300	678420	Pedagogy of the Oppressed is really good as well.
678420	680820	Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex is really good,
680820	684380	and it's big, but it's worth reading,
684380	686300	and it's lots of little chapters,
686300	688020	and each of them has something interesting to say,
688020	689860	and it's cool.
689860	692660	My favorite book of the list of things I've got right now
692660	696780	is Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Jesus and Sadism,
696780	699420	and it's really good because,
699420	700260	well, not this good, actually.
700260	702060	Do not buy this version.
702060	705140	Half, like, all, like, this side of every page
705140	708340	is grayer and harder to read.
708340	711020	Don't buy this version, but I had another version,
711020	712740	and again, like, I just lost a bunch of my old books,
712740	715900	but this is really, really good,
715900	718980	and I think it's that and perhaps some, like,
718980	721020	Zizek books are,
721020	722740	I wouldn't actually recommend any of his books, though,
722740	725700	are the most informative to my perspective
725700	728380	on how I approach a lot of issues, how I think about them,
728380	731020	and they're really good at getting you to question
733820	735540	how you approach an issue in the first place,
735540	737740	which is the thing I wanna stress.
737740	741740	You need to go, like, why am we doing this?
741740	744260	So, like, if you want to talk about these issues
744260	746100	to someone who doesn't understand them,
746100	748220	then the thing that they're probably missing,
748220	749940	first and foremost, is an understanding
749940	752580	of why it's important to approach things
752580	754900	from that perspective or from any perspective
754900	755780	in the first place.
755780	758420	A lot of people, the way they're currently thinking
758420	760060	naturally occurs to them,
760060	763740	and they wouldn't even think to use another approach,
763740	765300	so I think the purpose of a lot of this work
765300	769980	is to sort of plunge you into another perspective
769980	771340	and make you think from it.
771340	774940	A lot of writing on politics is written to be seamless,
774940	777180	to be like, oh, this goes down easy,
777180	778580	and this all makes sense,
778580	781820	and it complements the way I already looked at the world.
781820	785340	Like, all of, I was about to say all of Michael Moore's
785340	787140	books, but I only ever read one of them,
787140	789140	Stupid White Men, I think it's called,
789140	793660	is rubbish because it's so convenient.
793660	796700	Like, it just, it goes down so easy
796700	798340	that you don't actually learn anything from it.
798340	801780	You just go, ah, yes, these people are bad,
801780	803660	whereas I think a lot of the books
803660	805220	that I've just recommended are like,
805220	807020	oh, this is a way of looking at things
807020	808260	that I didn't have before,
808260	810700	and that's, like, more valuable almost.
810700	812860	In a way, I have a better understanding of
812860	815380	and appreciation for left-leaning ideas
815380	817780	because I've read so much right-wing bullshit in my life.
817780	821380	Every major villain in human history
821380	823620	has written a manifesto about why they're doing it.
823620	824460	Read that.
824460	826820	I wish I had a copy of Mein Kampf to hold up and go,
826820	828660	also read this because it's informative
828660	831940	and I think it's important to get the most
831940	834340	accurate understanding of the perspective that informs it,
834340	836140	but I don't actually have a physical copy
836140	839420	with me right now because the one that I recently bought
839420	840940	had to be returned because the text
840940	842340	went all the way into the spine.
842340	844540	It was incredibly poorly published.
844540	846540	Mein Kampf became public domain last year
846540	849140	and now exists in hundreds, if not thousands,
849140	852180	of versions and printings that are rubbish.
853100	854740	Also, by the way, if you're in high school,
854740	855980	do not ask your high school library
855980	857300	to get you a copy of Mein Kampf.
857300	858700	You will go on a list.
858700	860540	I don't know what's scarier in Mein Kampf,
860540	865340	the fact that you can feel yourself being propagandized,
865340	868980	you can feel yourself being almost convinced
868980	870420	of the thing that he's saying,
871340	872340	or the part where, you know,
872340	874300	it's just outright racist ideology,
874300	877340	or the bit where there's a bunch of advice in there
877340	879980	for how to act in modern politics that still works,
879980	882460	that's still 100% good advice
882460	883900	for how to be good in politics.
883940	886140	Like, that's scary in its own way.
886140	887620	Like, I'd recommend reading it
887620	889540	if you can stomach that sort of thing.
891020	891980	That was kind of a bit rambly
891980	893260	and there was a lot of books in there
893260	895460	and they might not even be the best books to start with,
895460	896940	but I hope that helps.
896940	897780	Thanks.
897780	900020	I noticed that you rarely discuss gender, sexuality,
900020	901860	diversity, or other SJW issues
901860	903380	in your non-measured response videos,
903380	906060	e.g. Fallout, Soulsborne, Braid.
906060	907660	The closest thing was talking about Irene
907660	908780	in your Sherlock video.
908780	910380	Is this an intentional choice?
910380	911860	If so, why?
911860	913300	If not, do you think there's a reason
913300	914700	why you keep that shit packed up?
914700	916420	Or is this all in my imagination?
916420	918220	I don't keep them divided on purpose.
918220	920260	I do think that I try and make everything
920260	922100	with the same kind of perspective in mind.
922100	924060	I don't like the idea of there being a break
924060	925740	in the kinds of content I make.
925740	927580	At the same time, I do think I talk quite a lot
927580	931900	about the ideas
931900	934660	and what they might mean for us as players
934660	935580	in games quite often.
935580	937380	Like, Dark Souls 2, I think,
937380	939740	has something really interesting to say
939740	941660	about its world, but more importantly,
941660	943580	about our world and how to live in it.
943580	945140	How do you live in a world
945140	947300	where you might not actually,
947300	948780	basically, have ever existed
948780	951620	because you'll die and be so completely forgotten
951620	952740	that it doesn't even matter?
952740	954540	Like, how do you act in a world
954540	956380	where that can happen?
956380	958020	I think it asks really interesting questions.
958020	960580	I don't like turning that kind of work
960580	962220	into a manifesto where I go,
962220	963380	oh, no, this is what this means
963380	964780	and this is how we have to live our lives
964780	966580	based on Dark Souls 2 telling us,
966580	968420	you know, I could do that,
968420	971060	but I have this, I guess the term is,
971060	972900	I guess I want to avoid being preachy,
972900	976500	and I think people are very quick
976500	978020	to dismiss people as preachy
978020	979620	if they just don't like what they have to say,
979620	981980	but I also want to avoid being it.
983020	985700	Some of the stuff that I'm working on right now,
985700	989980	especially the Deus Ex Human Revolution video,
989980	992500	which is the current long project I'm working on,
992500	993980	I always have a long project,
995220	997940	does deal quite a lot with social topics
997940	998900	and the points,
999860	1003460	and I guess it'll be my most SJW game analysis
1004500	1005580	just because it comes up more
1005580	1007100	because it's a game that prizes itself
1007100	1010300	so much more on story than Fallout 3
1010300	1011980	or the Souls games do.
1011980	1015780	In fact, they pride themselves on not having as much.
1015780	1017140	Are you single?
1017140	1019020	No, sorry.
1019020	1020740	Do you think that it's possible to be friends
1020740	1022980	with people who exhibit alt-right traits?
1022980	1026100	Is it possible to overlook such negative qualities?
1026100	1027860	That is a cracking question.
1027860	1029700	It's possible.
1029700	1031300	I know people who are like,
1031300	1032380	oh, I don't believe any of this,
1032380	1034180	but I can be friends with them, that's fine,
1034180	1036580	but they're usually people who don't have anything to lose
1036580	1038620	from the views of those people.
1038620	1039900	You know, if you want to,
1039900	1043860	let's take the most shitty definition of alt-right,
1043860	1045940	you know, like they want to build a white ethnostate.
1045940	1047660	Usually it's easy to be friends with those people
1047660	1048540	if you're white.
1049900	1051540	For me personally,
1051540	1053340	it's not possible to be friends with people
1053340	1055780	who exhibit really far-right beliefs.
1055780	1057540	Either I immediately start arguing with them
1057540	1059380	and, you know, there is no friendship,
1059380	1061620	or I sort of consciously remember
1061620	1063300	some of the shitty things they say
1063300	1064700	and just think less about
1064700	1065980	wanting to hang out with them again.
1065980	1069140	I have a friend who sort of shifted further right
1069140	1070340	in the last couple of years,
1070340	1071820	and I just stopped talking to him.
1071820	1073060	Like, not on purpose,
1073060	1074580	I didn't deliberately blank him or anything,
1074580	1076180	I'm not that sort of person,
1076180	1078380	but I just thought less and less
1078380	1080220	about that person in my life.
1080220	1082980	And that's just kind of how people are, I think.
1082980	1083940	I think there are probably people
1083940	1085900	who have thought less about hanging out with me
1085900	1088300	because of my far-left beliefs, you know?
1088300	1090700	That's just kind of how things work, isn't it?
1090700	1092140	Did you build your computer yourself
1092140	1094500	or pay to have one custom-built?
1094500	1096580	The first computer I ever had was custom-built
1096580	1098580	by this guy called Jed,
1098580	1100380	who I really looked up to and thought was cool.
1100380	1103700	So I was like, after this, I'm gonna build my own.
1103700	1106740	And then I bought an iMac and I used that for years.
1106740	1109860	But then I realized that I liked PC games
1109860	1112820	more than I liked having a slightly nicer version
1112820	1115740	of Photoshop, and eventually I built a PC
1115740	1118580	that could actually play games, and it was great.
1118580	1121100	And I've built my own PCs ever since.
1121100	1123260	What's your advice on long-distance relationships?
1123260	1125220	Oh, fuck.
1125220	1126820	You know, like in a lot of relationships
1126820	1128780	where you see the person every day,
1128780	1130580	you can get into this routine
1130580	1133420	where it just becomes normal to hang around with that person
1133420	1134580	and that's nice.
1134580	1135860	But I think if you're in a relationship
1135860	1137660	where you don't see each other as much,
1137660	1139060	it's important to make the times you are together
1139060	1141180	really special and feel really important.
1141180	1143180	You basically have to have a better relationship
1143180	1144380	in a shorter amount of time.
1144380	1148060	So make sure that you do that in whatever way you see fit,
1148060	1149620	because I don't know what that way is.
1149620	1151300	What color is your toothbrush?
1151300	1152780	It's blue and white.
1152780	1154500	How did you support yourself financially
1154500	1156940	before you were drafted into the culture war?
1156940	1161340	Okay, for about six months before I started making videos,
1161340	1165020	I was an IT engineer, and then I realized
1165020	1167220	that they were underpaying me
1167220	1168820	because they could get away with it.
1168820	1171900	So I quit and I started doing animations
1171900	1174460	for the School of Life on their YouTube channel,
1174460	1175580	which was fun.
1175580	1178100	And then I realized that that video I'd made
1178100	1181740	like a year ago by that point had done really well
1181740	1184060	and I could probably have made more
1184060	1186220	because the audience actually existed
1186220	1189300	despite me assuming it didn't for quite a while.
1189300	1192380	So then I just started making stuff in my spare time
1192380	1193980	while I was finding more work.
1193980	1197140	And then I stopped having to find more work
1197140	1198140	and it was really cool.
1198140	1199740	So that was that.
1199740	1201620	Prior to that, I had just got out of university
1201660	1204100	and I worked in a chip shop while I was at uni
1204100	1206580	for a couple of weeks and then I quit
1206580	1208620	and then the place got closed because of rats.
1208620	1211740	Have you ever played the LucasArts Adventures?
1211740	1212700	Not really.
1212700	1213740	I've heard they're really good
1213740	1215300	and I have no reason to disagree
1215300	1216860	because what I have played of them is good,
1216860	1218980	but I've never finished one or played it for that long
1218980	1220700	apart from the first Monkey Island.
1222140	1226220	I'm really more into the kind of weird adventure games
1226220	1228460	where you can die easily and they were made
1228460	1231500	with a very precise sense of humor
1232260	1234060	or they were just like shoddily put together.
1234060	1236020	Like there's something fun about playing bad
1236020	1236980	point and click adventure games.
1236980	1239020	So those are the ones that I've sought after as a child.
1239020	1241820	I was absolutely in love with Shadow of the Comet
1241820	1243340	and Prisoner of Ice growing up.
1243340	1246260	They're just fantastically,
1246260	1248980	just like not that great games,
1248980	1252060	but they're just fun enough that you do wanna keep playing
1252060	1253740	and you wanna know how the story ends
1253740	1256220	and you also want to experience the horror
1256220	1260500	of the game breaking or not working properly
1260540	1263380	or something that you never thought you had to do
1263380	1264460	hours before killing you.
1264460	1266660	Like they're that kind of school of game.
1266660	1269260	There's a fantastic part and I think it's Prisoner of Ice
1269260	1271460	where you're supposed to be looking around for an exit
1271460	1273420	and you're just off the screen
1273420	1274260	and there's nothing on the screen
1274260	1275980	that you can find to be going
1275980	1276820	where we're supposed to be going.
1276820	1277860	There's nothing there.
1277860	1279980	You walk the character off screen
1279980	1281420	and the character comes back and says,
1281420	1283020	there's more stuff here.
1283020	1285340	The camera turns and there's more stuff.
1285340	1289060	Like the game hits a point where it's just fucking with you
1289100	1292700	just like to see how much it can make you play.
1292700	1293820	And by the end,
1293820	1295980	you get a choice of two endings in Prisoner of Ice
1295980	1297460	and they're both basically the same
1297460	1299140	and they both end with the same cut scene
1299140	1300620	after this little bit in the middle.
1300620	1303540	And it's like, they were just testing to see
1303540	1305300	if I would bother getting to the end
1305300	1307740	and I lost by doing it.
1307740	1310340	Like I failed the test.
1310340	1312900	So those are the kind of games I got really into
1312900	1314220	instead of the LucasArts ones,
1314220	1317020	which always seemed kind of well-made and polished
1317020	1318500	and that just wasn't my style.
1318540	1321220	I actually think I own one of the few physical copies
1321220	1322820	of Limbo of the Lost,
1322820	1324740	which is a point-and-click adventure game
1324740	1326180	I'm gonna do a video about at some point.
1326180	1328540	I wanna do a video series about obscure games
1328540	1329460	not many people know about.
1329460	1330420	Limbo of the Lost is one of them.
1330420	1332060	It's a point-and-click adventure game
1332060	1334900	with assets just stolen from Oblivion
1334900	1337500	and Morrowind and Enclave and a bunch of other games.
1337500	1338700	And they just sold it.
1338700	1341140	Like people paid money to buy this game
1341140	1343580	and it's like basically theft.
1343580	1345180	I'd love to do a thing just looking at it
1345180	1347180	because it's also, alongside that,
1347300	1348820	before I found out all of that
1348820	1351580	and also then checked and found more myself,
1351580	1355220	that it's just such a bad game in so many ways
1355220	1358940	that it might be a game I played the most in my life
1358940	1361300	just to inspect it.
1361300	1365340	Sometimes you play games to sort of understand
1365340	1366180	why they were made
1366180	1368140	and a lot of bad point-and-click adventure games
1368140	1371220	do that better than any other game genre.
1371220	1373660	So it also means I missed out on a lot of the good ones.
1373660	1375420	So at some point I wanna go back
1375460	1377420	and play more of those,
1377420	1380900	but instead I'm more of the like kind of weird French ones,
1380900	1383460	the illegal ones,
1383460	1386700	and also really like some of the King's Quests
1386700	1387540	are really good.
1387540	1388580	Police Quest, Space Quest.
1388580	1391580	God, there's a lot of quests I just realized now finally
1391580	1392460	after all these years.
1392460	1393500	Gabriel Knight as well.
1393500	1394780	All through the Gabriel Knight games,
1394780	1396500	I like these obscene...
1396500	1397500	The first one's all right.
1397500	1399980	Like it's nice art.
1399980	1402300	The puzzles mostly make sense.
1402300	1404060	And then Gabriel Knight 2 and 3,
1404100	1407580	are just these like bizarro nightmares
1407580	1408780	that don't make any sense.
1408780	1410300	I mean, everyone kind of at this point knows
1410300	1412980	the cat hair mustache puzzle from the third game.
1412980	1415500	Imagine like me as a child
1415500	1418020	trying to like having to look that up
1418020	1419860	and going, why would you do this?
1419860	1421940	And it turned out that that was put in by producers
1421940	1423380	or something like they requested
1423380	1426540	some particularly hard puzzle for some reason.
1426540	1429380	I think it might be to sell strategy guides or something.
1429380	1431420	Hey, I recently rewatched your Undertale vid.
1431420	1433420	Any chance we could see a video about your disagreements
1433420	1436180	with the ideological implications of the game theorists,
1436180	1439020	even if it's just a short patron only vid for instance.
1439020	1440300	This question was asked in June
1440300	1441740	before the Lisa video came out
1441740	1445860	where I kind of do cover some of this, but no.
1445860	1447540	I also kind of liked leaving it
1447540	1449420	and that kind of vague comment and then moving on.
1449420	1452820	There's something funny about not fully explaining it.
1452820	1455060	But basically I think they reflect a perspective
1455060	1458060	that is sort of unhealthy to have about games
1458060	1460740	where you kind of inspect them for canon.
1460740	1464500	I think it's almost a crime to think wrong about games.
1464500	1466860	So game theorists are bad.
1466860	1468620	You know, for me, the fun of Sans
1468620	1471220	was that he's this kind of silly weirdo
1471220	1473580	who's clearly hiding something.
1473580	1475140	And finding out what that is
1475140	1477060	and getting this explanation during a fight
1477060	1479780	if you choose to play the game a certain way is really fun.
1479780	1482500	And I kind of think it almost takes away from that
1482500	1483580	for someone to go, ah, yes,
1483580	1485860	but I've gone over it with a fine tooth comb
1485860	1488660	and trying to piece together the comprehensive story.
1488660	1490940	Like, whatever story you turn up isn't as interesting
1490940	1493580	as the story you experience just playing it normally.
1493580	1496900	Um, that's, uh, it's, eh.
1496900	1499460	What's your guide to consuming inhuman quantities of media?
1499460	1502260	You seem to have seen slash read like fucking everything
1502260	1503540	while I take weeks to watch
1503540	1505500	like a single fucking season of a series.
1505500	1507020	Uh, I also do that.
1507020	1509340	I'm still partway through Recreators,
1509340	1511220	which is an anime I really like,
1511220	1514020	and I just stopped and haven't seen it again for a while.
1514020	1515020	And I don't know why I do that.
1515020	1517100	I do that with tons of shows that I really like.
1517100	1520180	I love Kino's Journey, and I still haven't seen,
1520180	1522700	I think, either of the Kino's Journey movies that exist.
1522700	1525060	And, like, why did I, why have I not done that?
1525060	1526340	That's stupid.
1526340	1527340	I have the same problem.
1527340	1531500	I just, uh, but the trick is to, uh,
1531500	1534060	watch things and remember the contents of them
1534060	1535540	as much as possible so that you then
1535540	1537380	can just call them back anytime.
1537380	1538540	Like, I'm 25.
1538540	1540660	I've had 25 years of consuming media.
1540660	1542980	I've seen, you know, all of the episodes of The Simpsons
1542980	1546820	that were out when I was, uh, 14.
1547580	1549700	I'd seen all of them because they were what I watched
1549700	1552020	as a kid, so, like, I have, like,
1552020	1555100	access to every event from, you know,
1555100	1557260	every quote from The Simpsons from those seasons
1557260	1559340	is just there in my head somewhere.
1559340	1561980	Just try and remember the things that you watch,
1561980	1564380	and you'll eventually have this huge backlog to refer to.
1564380	1566860	I don't watch that much stuff.
1566860	1569500	I still don't even watch the things that I like.
1569500	1572060	I make videos about games quite a lot now
1572060	1573060	for a living, basically.
1573060	1575300	I don't actually play that many games anymore
1575300	1577420	because making videos is so time-consuming.
1577420	1579180	Have you thought of doing a general election video?
1579180	1581220	It would be cool to see your political positions.
1581220	1583740	However, I can see how this might be divisive.
1583740	1586020	This question was made on the 1st of June,
1586020	1587660	and my answer to that question was,
1587660	1590900	oh, that's a good idea, and then I made a video about it.
1590900	1593140	So thank you, whoever asked that question,
1593140	1595700	for giving me the idea to make a video that
1595700	1596820	ended up doing quite well.
1596820	1598860	So I also want to do more political-type stuff
1598860	1601620	in the future along those lines, so thank you
1601620	1604460	for asking this question and changing
1604460	1608580	the future of my YouTube channel forever, whoever that was.
1608580	1610700	So I guess my answer to that question is thanks.
1610700	1612180	Does that count as an answer?
1612180	1614260	Do you feel that people are naturally good and made bad
1614260	1615780	by their environment, naturally bad and made
1615780	1617900	good by their environment, good is spelt with an I,
1617900	1621780	or blank slates entirely shaped by their environment?
1621780	1626340	I think that people don't have a nature.
1626340	1630020	I think that humans, if they have one key thing that keeps
1630020	1632620	happening is they change a lot.
1632620	1634660	Everything is always different with humans.
1634660	1637980	If you look at things from any measurement of distance
1637980	1641620	or time, we behave radically differently,
1641620	1643780	given just a couple of years or generations.
1643780	1648380	And the English language itself has altered radically
1648380	1651420	in the last few hundred years, and it kept changing.
1651420	1653820	So there are just periods of history
1653820	1655340	where if you move this person here,
1655340	1657180	you couldn't even understand them.
1657180	1659780	And from that perspective, of course our behavior
1659820	1661660	is going to change a lot, because the society
1661660	1664220	that we're in has a huge impact on it.
1664220	1665900	But because humans build society,
1665900	1667500	obviously it's not something we're completely
1667500	1669140	unable to control.
1669140	1671500	To a certain extent, no one's really in control of anything
1671500	1673980	and no one's to blame for any crimes.
1673980	1677100	Basically, the answer is it's too complicated
1677100	1682100	for anyone to understand, and we're in big trouble.
1682100	1684180	What do you think about Homestuck, if you've read it?
1684180	1687900	I've never read Homestuck, and I might never get around
1687900	1691020	to it, but I probably should at some point.
1691020	1695020	It looks okay, and everyone who talks about it
1695020	1697180	is very opinionated about it in some direction
1697180	1700780	or the other, and wow.
1701740	1703580	There's a picture going around of me and a friend
1703580	1708580	being yaoi'd, a woman drew us in an embrace,
1708940	1711500	and someone else drew a version of that
1711500	1713460	where we were Homestuck characters.
1713460	1717220	That's the most interaction I've had ever with Homestuck,
1717260	1720500	and I plan on reading it, but eventually.
1720500	1721820	I have no solid plans.
1721820	1724860	I might eventually read it, and I'm sure I'll love it.
1727300	1728980	That was a joke.
1728980	1730740	Any thoughts on the Dishonored series?
1730740	1732300	Dishonored series is really good.
1732300	1733140	It's really good.
1733140	1733980	It's really well made.
1733980	1735260	It's a really good immersive sim.
1735260	1737500	I was absolutely amazed by the level of just control
1737500	1739180	that you have over outcomes of encounters.
1739180	1742660	Like, I was kind of starved for games where you can just go,
1742660	1745860	oh, this person lives from this encounter,
1745860	1747660	and they come back, and it actually impacts the story,
1747660	1749740	even if it's just a little tiny way, it's good.
1749740	1751720	I really like the Dishonored series.
1752940	1755980	I haven't played the newest thing, Death of the Outsider.
1755980	1758140	I hope it's good.
1758140	1760260	I might actually do a thing on the Dishonored series
1760260	1761100	now I think about it.
1761100	1762700	Like, there's a lot to say, actually,
1762700	1764340	about the complexity of its design.
1764340	1767620	I probably should've thought to do that earlier.
1767620	1769300	Thanks, Question Asker, for reminding me
1769300	1770580	of a video I should make.
1770580	1772940	This question comes from Justin Partridge on Patreon.
1772940	1774860	Are you reading any new comics regularly?
1774860	1776740	Like, do you have a pull box somewhere?
1776740	1779260	I don't read that many new comics.
1779260	1781340	I tend to wait until the comic is done,
1781340	1783660	and then I can just read the whole thing through.
1783660	1786860	So I'm really looking forward to Black Panther, Black Bolt.
1786860	1788540	Those both sound really, really cool,
1788540	1790220	and I like the bits of them that I've seen.
1790220	1791440	I'd like to read them in full,
1791440	1794380	but I don't tend to read that many new comics.
1794380	1796940	And I also stopped reading web comics, like, regularly.
1796940	1799660	I started just going, oh, wait, six months or two years.
1799660	1801020	I mean, a huge burst.
1801020	1802260	I did that with Gunnakrig Court.
1802260	1804300	I read all of it, like, immediately
1804300	1805460	when I first heard about it,
1805460	1807500	and then I waited, like, four years
1807500	1808660	and then read all of it again.
1808660	1810860	It was great, and now I'm waiting again.
1810860	1812220	Max S. on Patreon asks,
1812220	1813580	does asking if you're going to do
1813580	1816100	a Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines video count as an ask?
1816100	1819180	Because I know you said you were going to do a New Vegas one,
1819180	1821780	and those are both in your Fallout 3 list.
1821780	1823420	Yes, I am eventually going to do it.
1823420	1826860	I actually have a specific idea for this in mind.
1826860	1830300	The best video essayist on YouTube bar none,
1830300	1832660	Noah Caldwell-Gervais, did a video
1832660	1835340	covering two of the games that Troika made,
1835340	1837820	and he says that Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines
1837820	1839060	doesn't hold up like he remembered it,
1839060	1841140	and it's actually quite bad in a lot of ways,
1841140	1843980	and that sounded like blasphemy,
1843980	1845300	but now I'm worried that he's right,
1845300	1847540	because, like, he's right about a lot of things,
1847540	1851660	so I'm probably going to do a video directed at him
1851660	1853860	where I specifically go, oh, yeah,
1853860	1855660	and go through it and see if he's right.
1855660	1857420	I think that'd be a really interesting video to try doing,
1857420	1858860	so, um, who knows?
1858860	1860140	Like, I haven't played it in quite a while,
1860140	1861220	and I remember really liking it
1861220	1862660	and thinking it was really good.
1862660	1863940	Am I going to have to, like,
1863940	1865820	retroactively apologize for that list
1865820	1868100	and go, like, ah, no, one of these was bad?
1868100	1870420	Like, that's a really cool video to make, actually.
1870420	1873700	I should make that sooner than I expected to.
1873700	1876220	This one comes from Alex Scranton on Patreon.
1876220	1877980	Who or what inspired you to toss your hat
1877980	1880260	into the fuckery of the YouTube gaming ring?
1880260	1882100	Were you always just interested in the criticism side,
1882100	1884340	or did you start by watching LPs or something else,
1884340	1886700	and what content creator would you say inspired you the most?
1886700	1890740	In terms of video game-related content,
1890740	1893100	there isn't much, but I really liked the tone
1893100	1896340	set by the people at Shut Up and Sit Down.
1896340	1898060	They've been doing board game reviews for years,
1898060	1899460	and even their earliest stuff
1899460	1902500	is just, like, really funny and well put together,
1902500	1904340	and I think that was the most directly inspirational
1904340	1908380	in terms of the idea that you could make this stuff.
1908380	1910020	I don't think I have any specific inspirations
1910020	1913500	in terms of the kinds of content I make myself, though.
1913500	1915420	I think it came from more of a place of realizing
1915420	1920100	that people have emotional responses to things
1920100	1921220	that they don't understand.
1921220	1922900	You know, like, I didn't enjoy Fallout 3
1922900	1925620	for a lot of reasons that I couldn't really articulate
1925620	1927100	when someone asked me why.
1927100	1929060	I think a lot of my videos are basically me
1929060	1932420	trying to kind of, like, explain why I felt the way
1932420	1933900	that I did in the first place.
1933900	1936300	It's kind of, like, taking steps backwards
1936300	1938780	from the visceral experience of playing the game,
1938780	1940140	if that makes sense.
1940140	1941900	Since you're pretty much the only famous
1941900	1943420	No Man's Sky apologist,
1943420	1944660	you should do a retrospective video
1944660	1946100	on the things they've changed to the game
1946100	1947420	and how they impact the vision of the game
1947420	1948740	as it was released, and really,
1948740	1950100	whose fault is it that Hello Games
1950100	1951980	ended up having such a terrible reputation?
1951980	1953700	Spoilers, it's Sony's fault.
1953700	1956660	Um, as someone who really liked specifically
1956660	1959380	what No Man's Sky was when it came out,
1959380	1961500	the fact they've changed it to be a lot more like the game
1961500	1962900	they apparently promised to people
1962900	1964740	I didn't pay attention to the marketing,
1964740	1966540	um, worries me a little bit.
1966540	1967820	I'm worried I'm gonna go back to it,
1967820	1970540	and it's not gonna actually be the thing that I enjoyed,
1970540	1973420	but if more people can be happy with the game it is now,
1973420	1975180	then good for them, I suppose.
1975180	1977500	No Man's Sky is a game that released in early access,
1977540	1978940	but they didn't tell anyone
1978940	1980220	that it released in early access,
1980220	1982460	which is a bold new strategy,
1982460	1985300	but also probably illegal.
1985300	1987140	Um, they probably should have just said,
1987140	1988660	it's gonna be, it's early access.
1988660	1990220	They could have just done that.
1990220	1992380	I'm not the biggest fan of early access as a business model,
1992380	1994260	but it would have made it a lot more.
1994260	1996340	At the same time, I appreciated the goal
1996340	1998740	of releasing a finished game that was empty and lonely.
1998740	1999580	I loved that.
1999580	2000980	Are you still developing that game?
2000980	2004020	Yes, I am spending ages on it.
2004020	2005540	I'd originally planned for it to be a challenge
2005540	2008140	where I do all of the writing and animation
2008140	2011060	and art and programming and music,
2011060	2012940	and then I slowly kind of realized
2012940	2015060	that I can't do all of that
2015060	2016700	because I'm rubbish at most of it.
2016700	2020460	So I should hire on people who can do all those things
2020460	2024460	and try and at least make it ever exist.
2024460	2027340	So a good portion of the last couple of months
2027340	2028860	has been me figuring out what parts of the game
2028860	2030740	I actually am comfortable with it being me making
2030740	2032420	and what parts I feel like I should outsource
2032420	2033660	to other people.
2033940	2036220	I'm now at the point where I'm explaining the idea
2036220	2039140	and the concepts I want to use in the game to other people.
2039140	2039980	And that's cool,
2039980	2042100	because it's kind of letting other people in
2042100	2043260	on the ideas that I've had
2043260	2044980	and finding out which ones are ridiculous
2044980	2045980	and I shouldn't be using
2045980	2047580	and just don't make sense to everyone else
2047580	2050380	and which parts actually do make some sense.
2050380	2052780	And also being forced to elevate a pitch your game
2052780	2055780	or describe it to someone else who has to weigh in on it.
2055780	2059580	I honestly think that collaboration between people
2059580	2062700	and having to explain yourselves to more people in a group
2062700	2064980	is more valuable than being one person
2064980	2066380	who spends years saving away
2066380	2068180	with a perfect vision or whatever.
2068180	2070900	I guess the answer is yes, I'm still developing that game,
2070900	2073100	but eventually it will be more than me
2073100	2074620	and maybe one day it'll exist
2074620	2078300	and I hope it's good because I've spent so long on it.
2078300	2080380	What is your favorite Blind Guardian album?
2080380	2082380	Night at the Opera, no question.
2082380	2084460	I even wrote Night at the Opera, no question on this.
2084460	2085980	It's the best full album.
2085980	2088180	I really like some of the songs on Wheel of Time
2088180	2089700	and Twisting the Myth,
2089740	2092740	but Night at the Opera is the whole package.
2092740	2093940	It's all good.
2093940	2096140	And yes, I did discover Blind Guardian
2096140	2100020	through the Robot Unicorn Attack heavy metal version.
2100020	2103380	I'm basically a cultural void.
2103380	2106100	That's all the questions that I could be bothered to answer.
2106100	2108580	Thank you all very much for watching.
2108580	2110020	You can reach me on Curious Cat
2110020	2112620	and I'll respond if I think it'll be interesting to do
2112620	2114580	and I won't make a fool of myself.
2114580	2116500	I might keep some back for a future video.
2116500	2122220	I kind of wanted to do a 150,000 subscriber one as well
2122220	2124340	and then I passed the 150,000 mark
2124340	2127780	while I was waiting for the plaque to arrive to do this one.
2127780	2133380	So I might eventually just do a 150,000 subscriber special
2133380	2134820	when I hit a different milestone,
2134820	2136620	so I'm always just a little bit staggered behind.
2136620	2137980	That might be a funny joke.
2137980	2139780	I'm also kind of thinking of just doing Q&A stuff
2139780	2140820	more often for backers.
2140820	2142300	I want to do a thing where, like,
2142300	2144860	people who back me a certain amount ask a question
2144900	2146700	and then I'll do a video answering them
2146700	2148060	and it'll be a nice, fun time.
2148060	2150980	I kind of want to do these kinds of videos more often.
2150980	2152940	I kind of am actually, you can probably tell,
2152940	2156340	I'm building a set and when it's finished
2156340	2157900	and also when it's warm because in the winter
2157900	2161540	it's freezing in here, I'm going to stream from here
2161540	2163740	and I'd love to do, like, Q&A streams from here
2163740	2165580	every now and then where I answer questions
2165580	2167740	asked by patrons, so let me know what you think of that.
2170700	2172300	I didn't write an ending for this video.
2172300	2173900	Bye.
2174860	2175700	Bye.
