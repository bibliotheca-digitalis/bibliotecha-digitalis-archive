00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Hello, I'm not legendary game designer Lorne Lanning,

00:03.080 --> 00:05.660
so I don't know why you're wasting your time here.

00:05.660 --> 00:07.160
But, hey, while I've got you,

00:07.160 --> 00:10.660
I recently passed 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.com,

00:10.660 --> 00:13.200
and after three months and one official complaint

00:13.200 --> 00:14.500
to YouTube management,

00:14.500 --> 00:16.540
my plaque finally arrived to confirm it.

00:16.540 --> 00:18.420
Anyway, it seems to be customary for YouTubers

00:18.420 --> 00:20.160
to do some sort of Q&A video

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
when they hit a certain amount of subscribers,

00:22.160 --> 00:23.660
and I love answering questions.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.620
I love discussing stuff.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.780
Uh, so I really felt like I should do one of those.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.360
I put out a thing, uh, months ago

00:29.360 --> 00:31.100
asking people to provide questions

00:31.100 --> 00:33.100
that they thought would be good for this sort of thing,

00:33.100 --> 00:34.940
and I also held back a couple of questions

00:34.940 --> 00:35.900
that I got on Curious Cat

00:35.900 --> 00:37.640
I thought would be worth answering on video.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.400
So, uh, we're gonna do that now.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.780
How old are you?

00:42.780 --> 00:45.780
Okay, I actually, um, made, like, little bits of notes

00:45.780 --> 00:47.440
next to some of the questions that I thought,

00:47.440 --> 00:49.780
oh, I might forget this when I'm actually recording it,

00:49.780 --> 00:51.860
and for some reason, in brackets, I put,

00:51.860 --> 00:53.780
it's 25 here.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.140
I'm not really sure why I did that.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.760
I must have very low expectations of myself.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.680
Anyway, yeah, I'm 25.

01:01.680 --> 01:07.500
I've kind of looked like I was 14 for most of my life.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.580
My hairline has always been this far receded,

01:10.580 --> 01:11.920
so you can't make fun of it

01:11.920 --> 01:13.540
because I'm comfortable with this.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.260
I fully expect to go bald within the next three to six months.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.620
I can't wait, to be honest.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.460
You know, I've never really cared about my appearance,

01:21.460 --> 01:25.500
as you can tell from just the way I dress and look.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.740
You can't let yourself care about your appearance

01:27.740 --> 01:30.500
when you look like me. It would destroy me.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.200
So I've always kind of just messed with my hair.

01:32.200 --> 01:36.000
I've always kind of grown it out super long for no reason

01:36.000 --> 01:39.580
and then shaved it all off just to see what would happen.

01:39.580 --> 01:42.700
Usually, it's looked rubbish, but I've never really cared.

01:42.700 --> 01:48.540
One time, I dyed my hair, like, really, really yellowy blonde

01:48.540 --> 01:52.740
for a video that I ended up deciding wasn't worth making,

01:52.740 --> 01:55.240
and the time for it has passed.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.860
It was a music video starring me as Milo Yiannopoulos.

02:00.860 --> 02:03.640
It's probably the most extravagant thing I'd ever done,

02:03.640 --> 02:06.860
and I dyed my hair for it, and it had to grow out,

02:06.860 --> 02:11.480
so it was like eight months of awful hair

02:11.480 --> 02:13.820
for a piece that I decided to not make.

02:13.820 --> 02:16.360
So if you're wondering why my hair was awful

02:16.360 --> 02:20.600
for a long stretch of last year and this year, that was why.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.240
I actually made it with two other friends.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.100
One of them was the musician who composed a bunch of it,

02:24.100 --> 02:25.380
and the other one sort of helped out on set

02:25.380 --> 02:27.380
when we were shooting it,

02:27.380 --> 02:29.340
and that guy also had a camcorder

02:29.340 --> 02:31.560
and was filming the whole process,

02:31.560 --> 02:33.640
including me dyeing my hair, so there's, like, a good...

02:33.640 --> 02:36.760
There's a good two-hour rubbish documentary

02:36.760 --> 02:40.380
about the hijinks that we got up to attempting

02:40.380 --> 02:42.600
to make this thing that I ended up never finishing.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.800
It looks like it's working.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.800
I can feel something happening,

02:45.800 --> 02:48.800
but I can also see my skin getting kind of reddish.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.300
Maybe I should edit that together for patrons.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.720
That would be a fun thing to do. Let me know.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.560
Anyway, I'm done hijacking that question

02:53.560 --> 02:55.260
and to ramble about my hair now, so let's move on.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.060
What's your favorite piece of fan fiction of any kind ever?

02:59.060 --> 03:01.420
You specified of any kind,

03:01.420 --> 03:03.340
which means I get to take wild leaps,

03:03.340 --> 03:04.920
so nice one there.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.680
My personal favorite fan fiction ever

03:08.680 --> 03:11.800
is a film that came out in 2014 called The Guest.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.060
The Guest is really, really good, by the way.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.640
You should watch it. It's really, really good.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.760
Dan Stevens, amazing in it.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.520
British people represent.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.220
That film is very clearly

03:22.220 --> 03:25.600
Chris Evans-era

03:25.600 --> 03:27.300
Captain America fan fiction.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.440
It is very deliberately a guy on the run

03:30.440 --> 03:34.220
from a S.H.I.E.L.D.-style organization

03:34.220 --> 03:37.440
trying to be a good person, live his own life in a world

03:37.440 --> 03:40.440
that no longer suits him.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.220
The serial numbers have been filed off,

03:42.220 --> 03:44.800
but there is a very clear S.H.I.E.L.D.-type organization.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.680
I mean, it might not actually be at all.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.180
There might not have been anyone's plan whatsoever,

03:49.220 --> 03:50.680
and I've just read into the film.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.300
It wouldn't be the first time,

03:52.300 --> 03:55.600
but for me, it's just a really, really good film,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.300
and it has enough little things in there

03:57.300 --> 04:00.220
that it qualifies as this kind of rumination

04:00.220 --> 04:02.600
on the kind of super soldier

04:02.600 --> 04:04.920
that Captain America is in the more recent films,

04:04.920 --> 04:06.680
and I think that's kind of interesting.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.880
It's also just a really good film.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.180
I am now, however, going to give my favorite fan fiction

04:10.180 --> 04:12.220
that's an actual fan fiction

04:12.220 --> 04:15.220
so that I've actually answered the question properly.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.500
As for my favorite piece of actual fan fiction,

04:17.500 --> 04:19.040
you have to go with My Immortal.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.820
It's really funny.

04:20.820 --> 04:25.280
It's definitely a parody of other fan fictions

04:25.280 --> 04:28.360
and the fights that happen when people collaborate on them.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.440
It's definitely a parody.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.980
I—if you don't agree that's a lie, it's not true.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.200
I'll see you in hell.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.360
It's—it's good, and it's funny.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.160
This next one's a long one.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.400
Great.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.660
Could you recommend some good social sciences literature

04:42.660 --> 04:44.200
for beginners or other literature

04:44.200 --> 04:45.820
that has influenced you the most?

04:45.820 --> 04:47.240
I'd love to be as articulate and good

04:47.240 --> 04:48.780
at critical thinking as you.

04:48.820 --> 04:49.980
That won't be too hard.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.680
Many of my acquaintances are right-leaning

04:51.680 --> 04:54.400
and pretty racist, sexist, homophobic, et cetera.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.900
Still, I feel like I could easily give them

04:55.900 --> 04:57.740
a bit of perspective if I only had enough knowledge

04:57.740 --> 04:59.140
and good argumentative skills.

04:59.140 --> 05:01.220
People have asked me for reading lists quite often.

05:01.220 --> 05:03.480
This is kind of a question that I held back

05:03.480 --> 05:05.720
because it's emblematic of a lot of questions I get.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.020
If I were to come up with, like, a list,

05:07.020 --> 05:08.640
it would just be just a lot of books

05:08.640 --> 05:10.020
from a variety of different categories

05:10.020 --> 05:12.020
because quite often something really simple

05:12.020 --> 05:14.520
that isn't really about any particular issue

05:14.520 --> 05:16.320
informs your perspective a lot,

05:16.360 --> 05:19.020
even though it's not even covering it.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.680
So rather than, like, just give you a list

05:22.680 --> 05:24.640
of all the books I happen to have read

05:24.640 --> 05:28.100
or pretend that I'm educated enough

05:28.100 --> 05:30.400
to know how to construct a reading list for someone else,

05:30.400 --> 05:33.560
I'm just gonna give some general broad strokes

05:34.400 --> 05:38.280
sort of recommendations for how to educate yourself

05:38.280 --> 05:39.860
and then give some actual recommendations.

05:39.860 --> 05:41.560
So I think I would first recommend

05:41.560 --> 05:43.820
looking at the basic ideas

05:43.820 --> 05:45.720
that underlie any particular social science.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.220
So, like, psychology, sociology,

05:49.220 --> 05:51.620
the other humanities, you know, the rest,

05:51.620 --> 05:52.760
whatever you want to call them,

05:52.760 --> 05:56.580
they exist for a reason to study a specific thing

05:56.580 --> 05:58.960
and they usually have some kind of specific goal in mind.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.200
So, like, psychology is the study of human behavior

06:03.200 --> 06:05.200
but also has the kind of goal

06:05.200 --> 06:08.120
of making people more healthy.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.200
I once read this little tiny book

06:10.200 --> 06:11.440
from years and years and years ago,

06:11.440 --> 06:12.280
it was really old,

06:12.280 --> 06:14.500
called Psychoanalysis for Normal People

06:14.500 --> 06:16.980
and it opened with a statement that said,

06:16.980 --> 06:18.180
what's the effect of,

06:18.180 --> 06:19.740
the purpose of psychoanalysis

06:19.740 --> 06:23.300
is to make you ready for anything, something like that.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.020
That, to me, was this sort of,

06:25.020 --> 06:27.220
aha, you know, this is why we do this.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.940
It's not just, ah, we're checking to see what would happen

06:29.940 --> 06:31.820
if you lock people up in a fake prison.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.580
It's we're trying to learn how we behave

06:34.580 --> 06:37.780
in different contexts so that we can better understand

06:37.780 --> 06:41.140
contexts we can create that enhance human behavior.

06:41.140 --> 06:43.400
You know, can we educate ourselves out

06:43.440 --> 06:45.280
of certain behaviors that we exhibit?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.760
I'd basically recommend you go to the source,

06:47.760 --> 06:51.160
look up the reasoning behind why a field of study exists.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.800
Like, why do people do psychiatry or psychology

06:54.800 --> 06:57.280
or sociology or any of the other humanities?

06:57.280 --> 06:59.400
Why, what is its purpose?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.600
What is it looking at?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.720
And what are its methodologies?

07:02.720 --> 07:05.020
And why is it beneficial to use them?

07:05.020 --> 07:06.880
I think a lot of people lack the sort of

07:06.880 --> 07:09.480
base level understanding of what it does and why

07:09.480 --> 07:11.840
that makes the whole thing make sense.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.360
So I don't think, I'm not sure if I have it anywhere,

07:14.360 --> 07:17.280
but when I was in my third year of university,

07:17.280 --> 07:19.680
I was doing an English and film degree,

07:19.680 --> 07:21.520
so I had lots of free time.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.760
I actually just started buying science and sociology books

07:25.760 --> 07:29.720
off of people who were doing either like a master's

07:29.720 --> 07:32.000
or were finishing and were selling their books.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.520
So I could just, out of interest, read what they were like.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.480
And that was kind of a, I guess, a flashpoint

07:36.480 --> 07:38.000
for my own understanding of these concepts,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.520
was bothering to just pick up a basic book on it and read it.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.720
In fact, I'm going to look for it now.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.000
Carry my portable recorder with me.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.400
I keep a bunch of books back here,

07:50.360 --> 07:54.580
and I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure my old applied,

07:55.760 --> 07:58.360
my old applied psychology book is here somewhere.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.520
I literally just like, there was a girl

08:00.520 --> 08:03.240
who was just finishing a master's and she was leaving,

08:03.240 --> 08:05.840
and she was selling all of the books that she bought

08:06.760 --> 08:08.440
because they're expensive.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.080
So people want to buy them used.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.440
Ah, the set is too big.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.920
It's in the way of my library.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.200
So they just started selling all the books.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.440
And here we are, I found it.

08:23.440 --> 08:28.440
It's next to my Call of Cthulhu third edition book.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.240
Well, I don't know what edition is actually.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.200
And also my collected works of George Orwell.

08:33.200 --> 08:37.060
This is why I don't have much of a system for this library.

08:37.100 --> 08:42.100
Ah, so this was the book that I,

08:42.340 --> 08:45.500
this was the book that I bought just for the fun of it.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.300
One of these, I have a couple others

08:47.300 --> 08:48.820
that I got off different people.

08:48.820 --> 08:53.060
And they're just books where they're basically

08:53.060 --> 08:55.500
just a primer on what the issue is.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.960
The most interesting part of the book for me,

08:57.960 --> 08:59.300
as someone who wasn't as interested

08:59.300 --> 09:01.700
in the social sciences at the time,

09:01.700 --> 09:04.340
was the preface, the introduction,

09:04.340 --> 09:08.020
and the, yeah, like, this was it.

09:08.020 --> 09:10.420
This was the eye-opening moment.

09:10.420 --> 09:15.340
1.1 of the introduction, what is applied psychology?

09:15.340 --> 09:17.860
Like, it opens by explaining what it is

09:17.860 --> 09:21.300
and what it's for and why you would care.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.340
And that's the most important part of these books,

09:23.340 --> 09:26.580
in my opinion, is explaining why it's valuable,

09:26.580 --> 09:29.620
why you would use it, and the purpose of approaching things

09:29.620 --> 09:31.240
from that perspective in the first place.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.500
Because that's the part that, in modern discourse,

09:33.500 --> 09:36.420
people ignore the most.

09:36.420 --> 09:40.300
They go immediately to the idea of this imagined intent

09:40.300 --> 09:45.260
that any psychologist or economist who disagrees with them

09:45.260 --> 09:49.340
or any kind of feminist-leaning person in the humanities

09:49.340 --> 09:52.500
clearly has this agenda, when the agenda, if anything,

09:52.500 --> 09:55.020
is spelled out already, and you can read it.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.240
And they've clearly ignored that to go,

09:56.240 --> 09:59.540
no, they want to collectivize everything

09:59.540 --> 10:01.780
or whatever it is that they say nowadays.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.620
This isn't the one book you have to read.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.780
But I would basically recommend picking up basic primers

10:08.780 --> 10:12.020
in any of these fields and just reading through them.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.140
This was a fantastic read.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.300
I basically just skipped through it the first time

10:16.300 --> 10:19.420
and just whoever had bought this before me

10:19.420 --> 10:22.980
had done their own markings, so I just read those bits

10:22.980 --> 10:24.140
and checked it out.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.300
It's really informative.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.100
Another book I would recommend while we're doing

10:28.100 --> 10:30.500
basic primers that you would do in a university level

10:30.500 --> 10:32.140
is Literary Theory and Anthology.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.420
It's the first book I got when I was in university.

10:34.420 --> 10:38.100
And I'm just gonna go over to my little bookshelf

10:38.100 --> 10:41.820
that I actually just got in so I can have more stuff,

10:41.820 --> 10:44.100
so I have more stuff on this set.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.300
What are some good ones?

10:48.500 --> 10:50.220
I'm not a very good educator.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.220
I can't be like, oh, here's all the stuff

10:52.220 --> 10:53.260
that you need to read first

10:53.260 --> 10:55.980
before gender trouble makes sense.

10:55.980 --> 10:56.820
I don't know.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.580
I don't know what it is.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.340
I didn't understand it until I read it,

11:01.180 --> 11:03.500
and then I did, so if there's some magic other step

11:03.500 --> 11:06.180
that a smarter person would tell you to read first,

11:06.180 --> 11:08.380
I'm sorry, I don't know what it is.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.340
Conquest of Bread is good.

11:10.340 --> 11:11.180
It's good.

11:11.180 --> 11:13.260
I'm just gonna unequivocally recommend that you read it.

11:13.260 --> 11:14.100
It's good.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.300
Just have fun.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.420
Pedagogy of the Oppressed is really good as well.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.820
Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex is really good,

11:20.820 --> 11:24.380
and it's big, but it's worth reading,

11:24.380 --> 11:26.300
and it's lots of little chapters,

11:26.300 --> 11:28.020
and each of them has something interesting to say,

11:28.020 --> 11:29.860
and it's cool.

11:29.860 --> 11:32.660
My favorite book of the list of things I've got right now

11:32.660 --> 11:36.780
is Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Jesus and Sadism,

11:36.780 --> 11:39.420
and it's really good because,

11:39.420 --> 11:40.260
well, not this good, actually.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.060
Do not buy this version.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.140
Half, like, all, like, this side of every page

11:45.140 --> 11:48.340
is grayer and harder to read.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.020
Don't buy this version, but I had another version,

11:51.020 --> 11:52.740
and again, like, I just lost a bunch of my old books,

11:52.740 --> 11:55.900
but this is really, really good,

11:55.900 --> 11:58.980
and I think it's that and perhaps some, like,

11:58.980 --> 12:01.020
Zizek books are,

12:01.020 --> 12:02.740
I wouldn't actually recommend any of his books, though,

12:02.740 --> 12:05.700
are the most informative to my perspective

12:05.700 --> 12:08.380
on how I approach a lot of issues, how I think about them,

12:08.380 --> 12:11.020
and they're really good at getting you to question

12:13.820 --> 12:15.540
how you approach an issue in the first place,

12:15.540 --> 12:17.740
which is the thing I wanna stress.

12:17.740 --> 12:21.740
You need to go, like, why am we doing this?

12:21.740 --> 12:24.260
So, like, if you want to talk about these issues

12:24.260 --> 12:26.100
to someone who doesn't understand them,

12:26.100 --> 12:28.220
then the thing that they're probably missing,

12:28.220 --> 12:29.940
first and foremost, is an understanding

12:29.940 --> 12:32.580
of why it's important to approach things

12:32.580 --> 12:34.900
from that perspective or from any perspective

12:34.900 --> 12:35.780
in the first place.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.420
A lot of people, the way they're currently thinking

12:38.420 --> 12:40.060
naturally occurs to them,

12:40.060 --> 12:43.740
and they wouldn't even think to use another approach,

12:43.740 --> 12:45.300
so I think the purpose of a lot of this work

12:45.300 --> 12:49.980
is to sort of plunge you into another perspective

12:49.980 --> 12:51.340
and make you think from it.

12:51.340 --> 12:54.940
A lot of writing on politics is written to be seamless,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.180
to be like, oh, this goes down easy,

12:57.180 --> 12:58.580
and this all makes sense,

12:58.580 --> 13:01.820
and it complements the way I already looked at the world.

13:01.820 --> 13:05.340
Like, all of, I was about to say all of Michael Moore's

13:05.340 --> 13:07.140
books, but I only ever read one of them,

13:07.140 --> 13:09.140
Stupid White Men, I think it's called,

13:09.140 --> 13:13.660
is rubbish because it's so convenient.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.700
Like, it just, it goes down so easy

13:16.700 --> 13:18.340
that you don't actually learn anything from it.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.780
You just go, ah, yes, these people are bad,

13:21.780 --> 13:23.660
whereas I think a lot of the books

13:23.660 --> 13:25.220
that I've just recommended are like,

13:25.220 --> 13:27.020
oh, this is a way of looking at things

13:27.020 --> 13:28.260
that I didn't have before,

13:28.260 --> 13:30.700
and that's, like, more valuable almost.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.860
In a way, I have a better understanding of

13:32.860 --> 13:35.380
and appreciation for left-leaning ideas

13:35.380 --> 13:37.780
because I've read so much right-wing bullshit in my life.

13:37.780 --> 13:41.380
Every major villain in human history

13:41.380 --> 13:43.620
has written a manifesto about why they're doing it.

13:43.620 --> 13:44.460
Read that.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.820
I wish I had a copy of Mein Kampf to hold up and go,

13:46.820 --> 13:48.660
also read this because it's informative

13:48.660 --> 13:51.940
and I think it's important to get the most

13:51.940 --> 13:54.340
accurate understanding of the perspective that informs it,

13:54.340 --> 13:56.140
but I don't actually have a physical copy

13:56.140 --> 13:59.420
with me right now because the one that I recently bought

13:59.420 --> 14:00.940
had to be returned because the text

14:00.940 --> 14:02.340
went all the way into the spine.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.540
It was incredibly poorly published.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.540
Mein Kampf became public domain last year

14:06.540 --> 14:09.140
and now exists in hundreds, if not thousands,

14:09.140 --> 14:12.180
of versions and printings that are rubbish.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.740
Also, by the way, if you're in high school,

14:14.740 --> 14:15.980
do not ask your high school library

14:15.980 --> 14:17.300
to get you a copy of Mein Kampf.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.700
You will go on a list.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.540
I don't know what's scarier in Mein Kampf,

14:20.540 --> 14:25.340
the fact that you can feel yourself being propagandized,

14:25.340 --> 14:28.980
you can feel yourself being almost convinced

14:28.980 --> 14:30.420
of the thing that he's saying,

14:31.340 --> 14:32.340
or the part where, you know,

14:32.340 --> 14:34.300
it's just outright racist ideology,

14:34.300 --> 14:37.340
or the bit where there's a bunch of advice in there

14:37.340 --> 14:39.980
for how to act in modern politics that still works,

14:39.980 --> 14:42.460
that's still 100% good advice

14:42.460 --> 14:43.900
for how to be good in politics.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.140
Like, that's scary in its own way.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.620
Like, I'd recommend reading it

14:47.620 --> 14:49.540
if you can stomach that sort of thing.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.980
That was kind of a bit rambly

14:51.980 --> 14:53.260
and there was a lot of books in there

14:53.260 --> 14:55.460
and they might not even be the best books to start with,

14:55.460 --> 14:56.940
but I hope that helps.

14:56.940 --> 14:57.780
Thanks.

14:57.780 --> 15:00.020
I noticed that you rarely discuss gender, sexuality,

15:00.020 --> 15:01.860
diversity, or other SJW issues

15:01.860 --> 15:03.380
in your non-measured response videos,

15:03.380 --> 15:06.060
e.g. Fallout, Soulsborne, Braid.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.660
The closest thing was talking about Irene

15:07.660 --> 15:08.780
in your Sherlock video.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.380
Is this an intentional choice?

15:10.380 --> 15:11.860
If so, why?

15:11.860 --> 15:13.300
If not, do you think there's a reason

15:13.300 --> 15:14.700
why you keep that shit packed up?

15:14.700 --> 15:16.420
Or is this all in my imagination?

15:16.420 --> 15:18.220
I don't keep them divided on purpose.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.260
I do think that I try and make everything

15:20.260 --> 15:22.100
with the same kind of perspective in mind.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.060
I don't like the idea of there being a break

15:24.060 --> 15:25.740
in the kinds of content I make.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.580
At the same time, I do think I talk quite a lot

15:27.580 --> 15:31.900
about the ideas

15:31.900 --> 15:34.660
and what they might mean for us as players

15:34.660 --> 15:35.580
in games quite often.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.380
Like, Dark Souls 2, I think,

15:37.380 --> 15:39.740
has something really interesting to say

15:39.740 --> 15:41.660
about its world, but more importantly,

15:41.660 --> 15:43.580
about our world and how to live in it.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.140
How do you live in a world

15:45.140 --> 15:47.300
where you might not actually,

15:47.300 --> 15:48.780
basically, have ever existed

15:48.780 --> 15:51.620
because you'll die and be so completely forgotten

15:51.620 --> 15:52.740
that it doesn't even matter?

15:52.740 --> 15:54.540
Like, how do you act in a world

15:54.540 --> 15:56.380
where that can happen?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.020
I think it asks really interesting questions.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.580
I don't like turning that kind of work

16:00.580 --> 16:02.220
into a manifesto where I go,

16:02.220 --> 16:03.380
oh, no, this is what this means

16:03.380 --> 16:04.780
and this is how we have to live our lives

16:04.780 --> 16:06.580
based on Dark Souls 2 telling us,

16:06.580 --> 16:08.420
you know, I could do that,

16:08.420 --> 16:11.060
but I have this, I guess the term is,

16:11.060 --> 16:12.900
I guess I want to avoid being preachy,

16:12.900 --> 16:16.500
and I think people are very quick

16:16.500 --> 16:18.020
to dismiss people as preachy

16:18.020 --> 16:19.620
if they just don't like what they have to say,

16:19.620 --> 16:21.980
but I also want to avoid being it.

16:23.020 --> 16:25.700
Some of the stuff that I'm working on right now,

16:25.700 --> 16:29.980
especially the Deus Ex Human Revolution video,

16:29.980 --> 16:32.500
which is the current long project I'm working on,

16:32.500 --> 16:33.980
I always have a long project,

16:35.220 --> 16:37.940
does deal quite a lot with social topics

16:37.940 --> 16:38.900
and the points,

16:39.860 --> 16:43.460
and I guess it'll be my most SJW game analysis

16:44.500 --> 16:45.580
just because it comes up more

16:45.580 --> 16:47.100
because it's a game that prizes itself

16:47.100 --> 16:50.300
so much more on story than Fallout 3

16:50.300 --> 16:51.980
or the Souls games do.

16:51.980 --> 16:55.780
In fact, they pride themselves on not having as much.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.140
Are you single?

16:57.140 --> 16:59.020
No, sorry.

16:59.020 --> 17:00.740
Do you think that it's possible to be friends

17:00.740 --> 17:02.980
with people who exhibit alt-right traits?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.100
Is it possible to overlook such negative qualities?

17:06.100 --> 17:07.860
That is a cracking question.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.700
It's possible.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.300
I know people who are like,

17:11.300 --> 17:12.380
oh, I don't believe any of this,

17:12.380 --> 17:14.180
but I can be friends with them, that's fine,

17:14.180 --> 17:16.580
but they're usually people who don't have anything to lose

17:16.580 --> 17:18.620
from the views of those people.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.900
You know, if you want to,

17:19.900 --> 17:23.860
let's take the most shitty definition of alt-right,

17:23.860 --> 17:25.940
you know, like they want to build a white ethnostate.

17:25.940 --> 17:27.660
Usually it's easy to be friends with those people

17:27.660 --> 17:28.540
if you're white.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.540
For me personally,

17:31.540 --> 17:33.340
it's not possible to be friends with people

17:33.340 --> 17:35.780
who exhibit really far-right beliefs.

17:35.780 --> 17:37.540
Either I immediately start arguing with them

17:37.540 --> 17:39.380
and, you know, there is no friendship,

17:39.380 --> 17:41.620
or I sort of consciously remember

17:41.620 --> 17:43.300
some of the shitty things they say

17:43.300 --> 17:44.700
and just think less about

17:44.700 --> 17:45.980
wanting to hang out with them again.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.140
I have a friend who sort of shifted further right

17:49.140 --> 17:50.340
in the last couple of years,

17:50.340 --> 17:51.820
and I just stopped talking to him.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.060
Like, not on purpose,

17:53.060 --> 17:54.580
I didn't deliberately blank him or anything,

17:54.580 --> 17:56.180
I'm not that sort of person,

17:56.180 --> 17:58.380
but I just thought less and less

17:58.380 --> 18:00.220
about that person in my life.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.980
And that's just kind of how people are, I think.

18:02.980 --> 18:03.940
I think there are probably people

18:03.940 --> 18:05.900
who have thought less about hanging out with me

18:05.900 --> 18:08.300
because of my far-left beliefs, you know?

18:08.300 --> 18:10.700
That's just kind of how things work, isn't it?

18:10.700 --> 18:12.140
Did you build your computer yourself

18:12.140 --> 18:14.500
or pay to have one custom-built?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.580
The first computer I ever had was custom-built

18:16.580 --> 18:18.580
by this guy called Jed,

18:18.580 --> 18:20.380
who I really looked up to and thought was cool.

18:20.380 --> 18:23.700
So I was like, after this, I'm gonna build my own.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.740
And then I bought an iMac and I used that for years.

18:26.740 --> 18:29.860
But then I realized that I liked PC games

18:29.860 --> 18:32.820
more than I liked having a slightly nicer version

18:32.820 --> 18:35.740
of Photoshop, and eventually I built a PC

18:35.740 --> 18:38.580
that could actually play games, and it was great.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.100
And I've built my own PCs ever since.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.260
What's your advice on long-distance relationships?

18:43.260 --> 18:45.220
Oh, fuck.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.820
You know, like in a lot of relationships

18:46.820 --> 18:48.780
where you see the person every day,

18:48.780 --> 18:50.580
you can get into this routine

18:50.580 --> 18:53.420
where it just becomes normal to hang around with that person

18:53.420 --> 18:54.580
and that's nice.

18:54.580 --> 18:55.860
But I think if you're in a relationship

18:55.860 --> 18:57.660
where you don't see each other as much,

18:57.660 --> 18:59.060
it's important to make the times you are together

18:59.060 --> 19:01.180
really special and feel really important.

19:01.180 --> 19:03.180
You basically have to have a better relationship

19:03.180 --> 19:04.380
in a shorter amount of time.

19:04.380 --> 19:08.060
So make sure that you do that in whatever way you see fit,

19:08.060 --> 19:09.620
because I don't know what that way is.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.300
What color is your toothbrush?

19:11.300 --> 19:12.780
It's blue and white.

19:12.780 --> 19:14.500
How did you support yourself financially

19:14.500 --> 19:16.940
before you were drafted into the culture war?

19:16.940 --> 19:21.340
Okay, for about six months before I started making videos,

19:21.340 --> 19:25.020
I was an IT engineer, and then I realized

19:25.020 --> 19:27.220
that they were underpaying me

19:27.220 --> 19:28.820
because they could get away with it.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.900
So I quit and I started doing animations

19:31.900 --> 19:34.460
for the School of Life on their YouTube channel,

19:34.460 --> 19:35.580
which was fun.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.100
And then I realized that that video I'd made

19:38.100 --> 19:41.740
like a year ago by that point had done really well

19:41.740 --> 19:44.060
and I could probably have made more

19:44.060 --> 19:46.220
because the audience actually existed

19:46.220 --> 19:49.300
despite me assuming it didn't for quite a while.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.380
So then I just started making stuff in my spare time

19:52.380 --> 19:53.980
while I was finding more work.

19:53.980 --> 19:57.140
And then I stopped having to find more work

19:57.140 --> 19:58.140
and it was really cool.

19:58.140 --> 19:59.740
So that was that.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.620
Prior to that, I had just got out of university

20:01.660 --> 20:04.100
and I worked in a chip shop while I was at uni

20:04.100 --> 20:06.580
for a couple of weeks and then I quit

20:06.580 --> 20:08.620
and then the place got closed because of rats.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.740
Have you ever played the LucasArts Adventures?

20:11.740 --> 20:12.700
Not really.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.740
I've heard they're really good

20:13.740 --> 20:15.300
and I have no reason to disagree

20:15.300 --> 20:16.860
because what I have played of them is good,

20:16.860 --> 20:18.980
but I've never finished one or played it for that long

20:18.980 --> 20:20.700
apart from the first Monkey Island.

20:22.140 --> 20:26.220
I'm really more into the kind of weird adventure games

20:26.220 --> 20:28.460
where you can die easily and they were made

20:28.460 --> 20:31.500
with a very precise sense of humor

20:32.260 --> 20:34.060
or they were just like shoddily put together.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.020
Like there's something fun about playing bad

20:36.020 --> 20:36.980
point and click adventure games.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.020
So those are the ones that I've sought after as a child.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.820
I was absolutely in love with Shadow of the Comet

20:41.820 --> 20:43.340
and Prisoner of Ice growing up.

20:43.340 --> 20:46.260
They're just fantastically,

20:46.260 --> 20:48.980
just like not that great games,

20:48.980 --> 20:52.060
but they're just fun enough that you do wanna keep playing

20:52.060 --> 20:53.740
and you wanna know how the story ends

20:53.740 --> 20:56.220
and you also want to experience the horror

20:56.220 --> 21:00.500
of the game breaking or not working properly

21:00.540 --> 21:03.380
or something that you never thought you had to do

21:03.380 --> 21:04.460
hours before killing you.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.660
Like they're that kind of school of game.

21:06.660 --> 21:09.260
There's a fantastic part and I think it's Prisoner of Ice

21:09.260 --> 21:11.460
where you're supposed to be looking around for an exit

21:11.460 --> 21:13.420
and you're just off the screen

21:13.420 --> 21:14.260
and there's nothing on the screen

21:14.260 --> 21:15.980
that you can find to be going

21:15.980 --> 21:16.820
where we're supposed to be going.

21:16.820 --> 21:17.860
There's nothing there.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.980
You walk the character off screen

21:19.980 --> 21:21.420
and the character comes back and says,

21:21.420 --> 21:23.020
there's more stuff here.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.340
The camera turns and there's more stuff.

21:25.340 --> 21:29.060
Like the game hits a point where it's just fucking with you

21:29.100 --> 21:32.700
just like to see how much it can make you play.

21:32.700 --> 21:33.820
And by the end,

21:33.820 --> 21:35.980
you get a choice of two endings in Prisoner of Ice

21:35.980 --> 21:37.460
and they're both basically the same

21:37.460 --> 21:39.140
and they both end with the same cut scene

21:39.140 --> 21:40.620
after this little bit in the middle.

21:40.620 --> 21:43.540
And it's like, they were just testing to see

21:43.540 --> 21:45.300
if I would bother getting to the end

21:45.300 --> 21:47.740
and I lost by doing it.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.340
Like I failed the test.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.900
So those are the kind of games I got really into

21:52.900 --> 21:54.220
instead of the LucasArts ones,

21:54.220 --> 21:57.020
which always seemed kind of well-made and polished

21:57.020 --> 21:58.500
and that just wasn't my style.

21:58.540 --> 22:01.220
I actually think I own one of the few physical copies

22:01.220 --> 22:02.820
of Limbo of the Lost,

22:02.820 --> 22:04.740
which is a point-and-click adventure game

22:04.740 --> 22:06.180
I'm gonna do a video about at some point.

22:06.180 --> 22:08.540
I wanna do a video series about obscure games

22:08.540 --> 22:09.460
not many people know about.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.420
Limbo of the Lost is one of them.

22:10.420 --> 22:12.060
It's a point-and-click adventure game

22:12.060 --> 22:14.900
with assets just stolen from Oblivion

22:14.900 --> 22:17.500
and Morrowind and Enclave and a bunch of other games.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.700
And they just sold it.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.140
Like people paid money to buy this game

22:21.140 --> 22:23.580
and it's like basically theft.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.180
I'd love to do a thing just looking at it

22:25.180 --> 22:27.180
because it's also, alongside that,

22:27.300 --> 22:28.820
before I found out all of that

22:28.820 --> 22:31.580
and also then checked and found more myself,

22:31.580 --> 22:35.220
that it's just such a bad game in so many ways

22:35.220 --> 22:38.940
that it might be a game I played the most in my life

22:38.940 --> 22:41.300
just to inspect it.

22:41.300 --> 22:45.340
Sometimes you play games to sort of understand

22:45.340 --> 22:46.180
why they were made

22:46.180 --> 22:48.140
and a lot of bad point-and-click adventure games

22:48.140 --> 22:51.220
do that better than any other game genre.

22:51.220 --> 22:53.660
So it also means I missed out on a lot of the good ones.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.420
So at some point I wanna go back

22:55.460 --> 22:57.420
and play more of those,

22:57.420 --> 23:00.900
but instead I'm more of the like kind of weird French ones,

23:00.900 --> 23:03.460
the illegal ones,

23:03.460 --> 23:06.700
and also really like some of the King's Quests

23:06.700 --> 23:07.540
are really good.

23:07.540 --> 23:08.580
Police Quest, Space Quest.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.580
God, there's a lot of quests I just realized now finally

23:11.580 --> 23:12.460
after all these years.

23:12.460 --> 23:13.500
Gabriel Knight as well.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.780
All through the Gabriel Knight games,

23:14.780 --> 23:16.500
I like these obscene...

23:16.500 --> 23:17.500
The first one's all right.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.980
Like it's nice art.

23:19.980 --> 23:22.300
The puzzles mostly make sense.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.060
And then Gabriel Knight 2 and 3,

23:24.100 --> 23:27.580
are just these like bizarro nightmares

23:27.580 --> 23:28.780
that don't make any sense.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.300
I mean, everyone kind of at this point knows

23:30.300 --> 23:32.980
the cat hair mustache puzzle from the third game.

23:32.980 --> 23:35.500
Imagine like me as a child

23:35.500 --> 23:38.020
trying to like having to look that up

23:38.020 --> 23:39.860
and going, why would you do this?

23:39.860 --> 23:41.940
And it turned out that that was put in by producers

23:41.940 --> 23:43.380
or something like they requested

23:43.380 --> 23:46.540
some particularly hard puzzle for some reason.

23:46.540 --> 23:49.380
I think it might be to sell strategy guides or something.

23:49.380 --> 23:51.420
Hey, I recently rewatched your Undertale vid.

23:51.420 --> 23:53.420
Any chance we could see a video about your disagreements

23:53.420 --> 23:56.180
with the ideological implications of the game theorists,

23:56.180 --> 23:59.020
even if it's just a short patron only vid for instance.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.300
This question was asked in June

24:00.300 --> 24:01.740
before the Lisa video came out

24:01.740 --> 24:05.860
where I kind of do cover some of this, but no.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.540
I also kind of liked leaving it

24:07.540 --> 24:09.420
and that kind of vague comment and then moving on.

24:09.420 --> 24:12.820
There's something funny about not fully explaining it.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.060
But basically I think they reflect a perspective

24:15.060 --> 24:18.060
that is sort of unhealthy to have about games

24:18.060 --> 24:20.740
where you kind of inspect them for canon.

24:20.740 --> 24:24.500
I think it's almost a crime to think wrong about games.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.860
So game theorists are bad.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.620
You know, for me, the fun of Sans

24:28.620 --> 24:31.220
was that he's this kind of silly weirdo

24:31.220 --> 24:33.580
who's clearly hiding something.

24:33.580 --> 24:35.140
And finding out what that is

24:35.140 --> 24:37.060
and getting this explanation during a fight

24:37.060 --> 24:39.780
if you choose to play the game a certain way is really fun.

24:39.780 --> 24:42.500
And I kind of think it almost takes away from that

24:42.500 --> 24:43.580
for someone to go, ah, yes,

24:43.580 --> 24:45.860
but I've gone over it with a fine tooth comb

24:45.860 --> 24:48.660
and trying to piece together the comprehensive story.

24:48.660 --> 24:50.940
Like, whatever story you turn up isn't as interesting

24:50.940 --> 24:53.580
as the story you experience just playing it normally.

24:53.580 --> 24:56.900
Um, that's, uh, it's, eh.

24:56.900 --> 24:59.460
What's your guide to consuming inhuman quantities of media?

24:59.460 --> 25:02.260
You seem to have seen slash read like fucking everything

25:02.260 --> 25:03.540
while I take weeks to watch

25:03.540 --> 25:05.500
like a single fucking season of a series.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.020
Uh, I also do that.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.340
I'm still partway through Recreators,

25:09.340 --> 25:11.220
which is an anime I really like,

25:11.220 --> 25:14.020
and I just stopped and haven't seen it again for a while.

25:14.020 --> 25:15.020
And I don't know why I do that.

25:15.020 --> 25:17.100
I do that with tons of shows that I really like.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.180
I love Kino's Journey, and I still haven't seen,

25:20.180 --> 25:22.700
I think, either of the Kino's Journey movies that exist.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.060
And, like, why did I, why have I not done that?

25:25.060 --> 25:26.340
That's stupid.

25:26.340 --> 25:27.340
I have the same problem.

25:27.340 --> 25:31.500
I just, uh, but the trick is to, uh,

25:31.500 --> 25:34.060
watch things and remember the contents of them

25:34.060 --> 25:35.540
as much as possible so that you then

25:35.540 --> 25:37.380
can just call them back anytime.

25:37.380 --> 25:38.540
Like, I'm 25.

25:38.540 --> 25:40.660
I've had 25 years of consuming media.

25:40.660 --> 25:42.980
I've seen, you know, all of the episodes of The Simpsons

25:42.980 --> 25:46.820
that were out when I was, uh, 14.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.700
I'd seen all of them because they were what I watched

25:49.700 --> 25:52.020
as a kid, so, like, I have, like,

25:52.020 --> 25:55.100
access to every event from, you know,

25:55.100 --> 25:57.260
every quote from The Simpsons from those seasons

25:57.260 --> 25:59.340
is just there in my head somewhere.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.980
Just try and remember the things that you watch,

26:01.980 --> 26:04.380
and you'll eventually have this huge backlog to refer to.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.860
I don't watch that much stuff.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.500
I still don't even watch the things that I like.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.060
I make videos about games quite a lot now

26:12.060 --> 26:13.060
for a living, basically.

26:13.060 --> 26:15.300
I don't actually play that many games anymore

26:15.300 --> 26:17.420
because making videos is so time-consuming.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.180
Have you thought of doing a general election video?

26:19.180 --> 26:21.220
It would be cool to see your political positions.

26:21.220 --> 26:23.740
However, I can see how this might be divisive.

26:23.740 --> 26:26.020
This question was made on the 1st of June,

26:26.020 --> 26:27.660
and my answer to that question was,

26:27.660 --> 26:30.900
oh, that's a good idea, and then I made a video about it.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.140
So thank you, whoever asked that question,

26:33.140 --> 26:35.700
for giving me the idea to make a video that

26:35.700 --> 26:36.820
ended up doing quite well.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.860
So I also want to do more political-type stuff

26:38.860 --> 26:41.620
in the future along those lines, so thank you

26:41.620 --> 26:44.460
for asking this question and changing

26:44.460 --> 26:48.580
the future of my YouTube channel forever, whoever that was.

26:48.580 --> 26:50.700
So I guess my answer to that question is thanks.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.180
Does that count as an answer?

26:52.180 --> 26:54.260
Do you feel that people are naturally good and made bad

26:54.260 --> 26:55.780
by their environment, naturally bad and made

26:55.780 --> 26:57.900
good by their environment, good is spelt with an I,

26:57.900 --> 27:01.780
or blank slates entirely shaped by their environment?

27:01.780 --> 27:06.340
I think that people don't have a nature.

27:06.340 --> 27:10.020
I think that humans, if they have one key thing that keeps

27:10.020 --> 27:12.620
happening is they change a lot.

27:12.620 --> 27:14.660
Everything is always different with humans.

27:14.660 --> 27:17.980
If you look at things from any measurement of distance

27:17.980 --> 27:21.620
or time, we behave radically differently,

27:21.620 --> 27:23.780
given just a couple of years or generations.

27:23.780 --> 27:28.380
And the English language itself has altered radically

27:28.380 --> 27:31.420
in the last few hundred years, and it kept changing.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.820
So there are just periods of history

27:33.820 --> 27:35.340
where if you move this person here,

27:35.340 --> 27:37.180
you couldn't even understand them.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.780
And from that perspective, of course our behavior

27:39.820 --> 27:41.660
is going to change a lot, because the society

27:41.660 --> 27:44.220
that we're in has a huge impact on it.

27:44.220 --> 27:45.900
But because humans build society,

27:45.900 --> 27:47.500
obviously it's not something we're completely

27:47.500 --> 27:49.140
unable to control.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.500
To a certain extent, no one's really in control of anything

27:51.500 --> 27:53.980
and no one's to blame for any crimes.

27:53.980 --> 27:57.100
Basically, the answer is it's too complicated

27:57.100 --> 28:02.100
for anyone to understand, and we're in big trouble.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.180
What do you think about Homestuck, if you've read it?

28:04.180 --> 28:07.900
I've never read Homestuck, and I might never get around

28:07.900 --> 28:11.020
to it, but I probably should at some point.

28:11.020 --> 28:15.020
It looks okay, and everyone who talks about it

28:15.020 --> 28:17.180
is very opinionated about it in some direction

28:17.180 --> 28:20.780
or the other, and wow.

28:21.740 --> 28:23.580
There's a picture going around of me and a friend

28:23.580 --> 28:28.580
being yaoi'd, a woman drew us in an embrace,

28:28.940 --> 28:31.500
and someone else drew a version of that

28:31.500 --> 28:33.460
where we were Homestuck characters.

28:33.460 --> 28:37.220
That's the most interaction I've had ever with Homestuck,

28:37.260 --> 28:40.500
and I plan on reading it, but eventually.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.820
I have no solid plans.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.860
I might eventually read it, and I'm sure I'll love it.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.980
That was a joke.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.740
Any thoughts on the Dishonored series?

28:50.740 --> 28:52.300
Dishonored series is really good.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.140
It's really good.

28:53.140 --> 28:53.980
It's really well made.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.260
It's a really good immersive sim.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.500
I was absolutely amazed by the level of just control

28:57.500 --> 28:59.180
that you have over outcomes of encounters.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.660
Like, I was kind of starved for games where you can just go,

29:02.660 --> 29:05.860
oh, this person lives from this encounter,

29:05.860 --> 29:07.660
and they come back, and it actually impacts the story,

29:07.660 --> 29:09.740
even if it's just a little tiny way, it's good.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.720
I really like the Dishonored series.

29:12.940 --> 29:15.980
I haven't played the newest thing, Death of the Outsider.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.140
I hope it's good.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.260
I might actually do a thing on the Dishonored series

29:20.260 --> 29:21.100
now I think about it.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.700
Like, there's a lot to say, actually,

29:22.700 --> 29:24.340
about the complexity of its design.

29:24.340 --> 29:27.620
I probably should've thought to do that earlier.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.300
Thanks, Question Asker, for reminding me

29:29.300 --> 29:30.580
of a video I should make.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.940
This question comes from Justin Partridge on Patreon.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.860
Are you reading any new comics regularly?

29:34.860 --> 29:36.740
Like, do you have a pull box somewhere?

29:36.740 --> 29:39.260
I don't read that many new comics.

29:39.260 --> 29:41.340
I tend to wait until the comic is done,

29:41.340 --> 29:43.660
and then I can just read the whole thing through.

29:43.660 --> 29:46.860
So I'm really looking forward to Black Panther, Black Bolt.

29:46.860 --> 29:48.540
Those both sound really, really cool,

29:48.540 --> 29:50.220
and I like the bits of them that I've seen.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.440
I'd like to read them in full,

29:51.440 --> 29:54.380
but I don't tend to read that many new comics.

29:54.380 --> 29:56.940
And I also stopped reading web comics, like, regularly.

29:56.940 --> 29:59.660
I started just going, oh, wait, six months or two years.

29:59.660 --> 30:01.020
I mean, a huge burst.

30:01.020 --> 30:02.260
I did that with Gunnakrig Court.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.300
I read all of it, like, immediately

30:04.300 --> 30:05.460
when I first heard about it,

30:05.460 --> 30:07.500
and then I waited, like, four years

30:07.500 --> 30:08.660
and then read all of it again.

30:08.660 --> 30:10.860
It was great, and now I'm waiting again.

30:10.860 --> 30:12.220
Max S. on Patreon asks,

30:12.220 --> 30:13.580
does asking if you're going to do

30:13.580 --> 30:16.100
a Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines video count as an ask?

30:16.100 --> 30:19.180
Because I know you said you were going to do a New Vegas one,

30:19.180 --> 30:21.780
and those are both in your Fallout 3 list.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.420
Yes, I am eventually going to do it.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.860
I actually have a specific idea for this in mind.

30:26.860 --> 30:30.300
The best video essayist on YouTube bar none,

30:30.300 --> 30:32.660
Noah Caldwell-Gervais, did a video

30:32.660 --> 30:35.340
covering two of the games that Troika made,

30:35.340 --> 30:37.820
and he says that Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines

30:37.820 --> 30:39.060
doesn't hold up like he remembered it,

30:39.060 --> 30:41.140
and it's actually quite bad in a lot of ways,

30:41.140 --> 30:43.980
and that sounded like blasphemy,

30:43.980 --> 30:45.300
but now I'm worried that he's right,

30:45.300 --> 30:47.540
because, like, he's right about a lot of things,

30:47.540 --> 30:51.660
so I'm probably going to do a video directed at him

30:51.660 --> 30:53.860
where I specifically go, oh, yeah,

30:53.860 --> 30:55.660
and go through it and see if he's right.

30:55.660 --> 30:57.420
I think that'd be a really interesting video to try doing,

30:57.420 --> 30:58.860
so, um, who knows?

30:58.860 --> 31:00.140
Like, I haven't played it in quite a while,

31:00.140 --> 31:01.220
and I remember really liking it

31:01.220 --> 31:02.660
and thinking it was really good.

31:02.660 --> 31:03.940
Am I going to have to, like,

31:03.940 --> 31:05.820
retroactively apologize for that list

31:05.820 --> 31:08.100
and go, like, ah, no, one of these was bad?

31:08.100 --> 31:10.420
Like, that's a really cool video to make, actually.

31:10.420 --> 31:13.700
I should make that sooner than I expected to.

31:13.700 --> 31:16.220
This one comes from Alex Scranton on Patreon.

31:16.220 --> 31:17.980
Who or what inspired you to toss your hat

31:17.980 --> 31:20.260
into the fuckery of the YouTube gaming ring?

31:20.260 --> 31:22.100
Were you always just interested in the criticism side,

31:22.100 --> 31:24.340
or did you start by watching LPs or something else,

31:24.340 --> 31:26.700
and what content creator would you say inspired you the most?

31:26.700 --> 31:30.740
In terms of video game-related content,

31:30.740 --> 31:33.100
there isn't much, but I really liked the tone

31:33.100 --> 31:36.340
set by the people at Shut Up and Sit Down.

31:36.340 --> 31:38.060
They've been doing board game reviews for years,

31:38.060 --> 31:39.460
and even their earliest stuff

31:39.460 --> 31:42.500
is just, like, really funny and well put together,

31:42.500 --> 31:44.340
and I think that was the most directly inspirational

31:44.340 --> 31:48.380
in terms of the idea that you could make this stuff.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.020
I don't think I have any specific inspirations

31:50.020 --> 31:53.500
in terms of the kinds of content I make myself, though.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.420
I think it came from more of a place of realizing

31:55.420 --> 32:00.100
that people have emotional responses to things

32:00.100 --> 32:01.220
that they don't understand.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.900
You know, like, I didn't enjoy Fallout 3

32:02.900 --> 32:05.620
for a lot of reasons that I couldn't really articulate

32:05.620 --> 32:07.100
when someone asked me why.

32:07.100 --> 32:09.060
I think a lot of my videos are basically me

32:09.060 --> 32:12.420
trying to kind of, like, explain why I felt the way

32:12.420 --> 32:13.900
that I did in the first place.

32:13.900 --> 32:16.300
It's kind of, like, taking steps backwards

32:16.300 --> 32:18.780
from the visceral experience of playing the game,

32:18.780 --> 32:20.140
if that makes sense.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.900
Since you're pretty much the only famous

32:21.900 --> 32:23.420
No Man's Sky apologist,

32:23.420 --> 32:24.660
you should do a retrospective video

32:24.660 --> 32:26.100
on the things they've changed to the game

32:26.100 --> 32:27.420
and how they impact the vision of the game

32:27.420 --> 32:28.740
as it was released, and really,

32:28.740 --> 32:30.100
whose fault is it that Hello Games

32:30.100 --> 32:31.980
ended up having such a terrible reputation?

32:31.980 --> 32:33.700
Spoilers, it's Sony's fault.

32:33.700 --> 32:36.660
Um, as someone who really liked specifically

32:36.660 --> 32:39.380
what No Man's Sky was when it came out,

32:39.380 --> 32:41.500
the fact they've changed it to be a lot more like the game

32:41.500 --> 32:42.900
they apparently promised to people

32:42.900 --> 32:44.740
I didn't pay attention to the marketing,

32:44.740 --> 32:46.540
um, worries me a little bit.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.820
I'm worried I'm gonna go back to it,

32:47.820 --> 32:50.540
and it's not gonna actually be the thing that I enjoyed,

32:50.540 --> 32:53.420
but if more people can be happy with the game it is now,

32:53.420 --> 32:55.180
then good for them, I suppose.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.500
No Man's Sky is a game that released in early access,

32:57.540 --> 32:58.940
but they didn't tell anyone

32:58.940 --> 33:00.220
that it released in early access,

33:00.220 --> 33:02.460
which is a bold new strategy,

33:02.460 --> 33:05.300
but also probably illegal.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.140
Um, they probably should have just said,

33:07.140 --> 33:08.660
it's gonna be, it's early access.

33:08.660 --> 33:10.220
They could have just done that.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.380
I'm not the biggest fan of early access as a business model,

33:12.380 --> 33:14.260
but it would have made it a lot more.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.340
At the same time, I appreciated the goal

33:16.340 --> 33:18.740
of releasing a finished game that was empty and lonely.

33:18.740 --> 33:19.580
I loved that.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.980
Are you still developing that game?

33:20.980 --> 33:24.020
Yes, I am spending ages on it.

33:24.020 --> 33:25.540
I'd originally planned for it to be a challenge

33:25.540 --> 33:28.140
where I do all of the writing and animation

33:28.140 --> 33:31.060
and art and programming and music,

33:31.060 --> 33:32.940
and then I slowly kind of realized

33:32.940 --> 33:35.060
that I can't do all of that

33:35.060 --> 33:36.700
because I'm rubbish at most of it.

33:36.700 --> 33:40.460
So I should hire on people who can do all those things

33:40.460 --> 33:44.460
and try and at least make it ever exist.

33:44.460 --> 33:47.340
So a good portion of the last couple of months

33:47.340 --> 33:48.860
has been me figuring out what parts of the game

33:48.860 --> 33:50.740
I actually am comfortable with it being me making

33:50.740 --> 33:52.420
and what parts I feel like I should outsource

33:52.420 --> 33:53.660
to other people.

33:53.940 --> 33:56.220
I'm now at the point where I'm explaining the idea

33:56.220 --> 33:59.140
and the concepts I want to use in the game to other people.

33:59.140 --> 33:59.980
And that's cool,

33:59.980 --> 34:02.100
because it's kind of letting other people in

34:02.100 --> 34:03.260
on the ideas that I've had

34:03.260 --> 34:04.980
and finding out which ones are ridiculous

34:04.980 --> 34:05.980
and I shouldn't be using

34:05.980 --> 34:07.580
and just don't make sense to everyone else

34:07.580 --> 34:10.380
and which parts actually do make some sense.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.780
And also being forced to elevate a pitch your game

34:12.780 --> 34:15.780
or describe it to someone else who has to weigh in on it.

34:15.780 --> 34:19.580
I honestly think that collaboration between people

34:19.580 --> 34:22.700
and having to explain yourselves to more people in a group

34:22.700 --> 34:24.980
is more valuable than being one person

34:24.980 --> 34:26.380
who spends years saving away

34:26.380 --> 34:28.180
with a perfect vision or whatever.

34:28.180 --> 34:30.900
I guess the answer is yes, I'm still developing that game,

34:30.900 --> 34:33.100
but eventually it will be more than me

34:33.100 --> 34:34.620
and maybe one day it'll exist

34:34.620 --> 34:38.300
and I hope it's good because I've spent so long on it.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.380
What is your favorite Blind Guardian album?

34:40.380 --> 34:42.380
Night at the Opera, no question.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.460
I even wrote Night at the Opera, no question on this.

34:44.460 --> 34:45.980
It's the best full album.

34:45.980 --> 34:48.180
I really like some of the songs on Wheel of Time

34:48.180 --> 34:49.700
and Twisting the Myth,

34:49.740 --> 34:52.740
but Night at the Opera is the whole package.

34:52.740 --> 34:53.940
It's all good.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.140
And yes, I did discover Blind Guardian

34:56.140 --> 35:00.020
through the Robot Unicorn Attack heavy metal version.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.380
I'm basically a cultural void.

35:03.380 --> 35:06.100
That's all the questions that I could be bothered to answer.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.580
Thank you all very much for watching.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.020
You can reach me on Curious Cat

35:10.020 --> 35:12.620
and I'll respond if I think it'll be interesting to do

35:12.620 --> 35:14.580
and I won't make a fool of myself.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.500
I might keep some back for a future video.

35:16.500 --> 35:22.220
I kind of wanted to do a 150,000 subscriber one as well

35:22.220 --> 35:24.340
and then I passed the 150,000 mark

35:24.340 --> 35:27.780
while I was waiting for the plaque to arrive to do this one.

35:27.780 --> 35:33.380
So I might eventually just do a 150,000 subscriber special

35:33.380 --> 35:34.820
when I hit a different milestone,

35:34.820 --> 35:36.620
so I'm always just a little bit staggered behind.

35:36.620 --> 35:37.980
That might be a funny joke.

35:37.980 --> 35:39.780
I'm also kind of thinking of just doing Q&A stuff

35:39.780 --> 35:40.820
more often for backers.

35:40.820 --> 35:42.300
I want to do a thing where, like,

35:42.300 --> 35:44.860
people who back me a certain amount ask a question

35:44.900 --> 35:46.700
and then I'll do a video answering them

35:46.700 --> 35:48.060
and it'll be a nice, fun time.

35:48.060 --> 35:50.980
I kind of want to do these kinds of videos more often.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.940
I kind of am actually, you can probably tell,

35:52.940 --> 35:56.340
I'm building a set and when it's finished

35:56.340 --> 35:57.900
and also when it's warm because in the winter

35:57.900 --> 36:01.540
it's freezing in here, I'm going to stream from here

36:01.540 --> 36:03.740
and I'd love to do, like, Q&A streams from here

36:03.740 --> 36:05.580
every now and then where I answer questions

36:05.580 --> 36:07.740
asked by patrons, so let me know what you think of that.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.300
I didn't write an ending for this video.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.900
Bye.

36:14.860 --> 36:15.700
Bye.
