00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You might have noticed that friend of the show, Pajama Watso,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,380
has been getting some criticisms of the soy video he made.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,880
For example, that it's a lie peddled to an undiscerning audience

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
based on bad science that he got from someone who went on to say that they think he's wrong.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,980
But Paul's a professional journalist, so, of course, in responding to these criticisms,

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,320
he took the intellectual high road of putting on a wig and screaming at a camera

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,240
while making vague allusions to my video on the topic.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,080
Let me demonstrate this in an obnoxious 30-minute YouTube response video!

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,240
Editor-at-large of Infowars.com there,

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,740
clearly behaving like someone who definitely isn't mad that they got owned online

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,000
and just wants to have a reasonable conversation about the facts.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
First things first, hey, thanks for the shout-out, Paul.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,580
I love being acknowledged by my peers online.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,040
It makes me feel powerful, virile, even.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,000
You can't bottle that feeling, and I know because you've tried!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,180
Secondly, what's most fascinating about this comment

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,720
is that it's the closest I think I've seen someone come to admitting that they've lost.

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,660
If I'd made even a minor error that was easy to debunk or respond to in my 30-minute-long video,

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,280
Paul would have done that, wouldn't he?

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,300
He'd have gone in so hard on me, just rough and uncensored!

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,500
He'd have just gone to town on me with hisâ€”with his soy-encrusted tongue!

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,760
But it appears that I owned him so hard with such bulletproof reasoning

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,060
that he didn't even mention me or my video directly,

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,380
despite the fact that we have mutual friends,

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,020
so I know he's seen the video, and I know it really pissed him off.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,720
In order to look like he has the intellectual upper hand here,

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,640
he has to make sure the only contact his audience has with my video,

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,440
in which I cite evidence and statistics and studies and make a couple of silly jokes

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,820
but ultimately come down on the side of having an actual, reasonable discussion about the data,

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,860
is him dressed in a wig acting like this.

31
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,000
I guess it's easy to win a fight with an opponent made of straw.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,240
Seriously, this is how much displacement he had to do to bring my work down to a level

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,020
he feels he can beat.

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,080
I guess when you have trouble pronouncing the word milliliter when it's written in front of you?

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,900
Millimeter!

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,040
You're only really capable of winning arguments with yourself in a wig.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,340
But I've noticed a certain unhealthy power around Paul's eyes lately.

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,260
I've noticed he might be missing out on one of the most important health products of all.

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,100
It appears that sad boy Paul is suffering from fact deficiency.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,300
Let's take a look at some of the new claims that Paul made

41
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,460
while trying to defend the supplement he sells to keep the lights on, Brain Force Plus.

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,040
Some people say I'm a hypocrite because Brain Force contains soy.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Well, Brain Force also contains alpha-GPC.

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,680
Lots of it.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,840
Alpha-GPC increases libido.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,500
How much?

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,640
Well, just ask this 79-year-old Italian man.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,340
He went from a doddering pensioner to a rampaging sex chad virtually overnight.

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,320
We had to put a bit of soy in Brain Force just to balance it out.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,520
That's huge if it turns out to be true!

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,900
Shame it isn't, though.

52
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,980
Firstly, by overnight, Paul means six weeks.

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
That's like 40 overnights.

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,120
You can even see it in the screenshot he shows you.

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,420
Secondly, the man was taking alpha-GPC in order to try and reduce the kinds of memory loss that come with old age.

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,500
He could have been taking up to 1,200 milligrams a day.

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,120
For reference, Paul's daily two capsules of Brain Force Plus will net him about 156 milligrams of alpha-GPC a day.

58
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,460
So if you want, you too can replicate the effects this man had

59
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,540
by taking just 16 Brain Force Plus pills a day,

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,340
which is eight times the recommended dose,

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,380
and also, for the record, literally half a bottle.

62
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:32,060
By the way, just one bottle of that stuff retails on the InfoWars website for $39.95.

63
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,280
So just to take the dosage this guy was getting for the six weeks that Paul is pretending was overnight,

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,780
it'll cost you $838 and change.

65
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,360
Sounds like a bargain to me.

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,780
Yeah, to hell with those soy boys improving their lives with minor changes in their dietary decisions.

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,860
Oh, God. Idiots.

68
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,280
I'll be a real man once I've taken all 16 of my daily pills.

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,200
Yeah, get that down, yeah, that'll make you into a real alpha male.

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,160
That'll be $20 a day, please.

71
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,700
Incidentally, you can find alpha-GPC supplements on Amazon that have 300 milligrams in them per pill,

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,040
which is double what you get in two of Brain Force Plus,

73
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,700
and they come in packs of 120 pills for $29.95.

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,580
I'm beginning to think that InfoWars is some kind of scam

75
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,540
in order to keep Alex Jones in Rolexes at the expense of his audience.

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,340
Let's not rag on Paul too much just yet, though.

77
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,040
Alpha-GPC probably is good for you, and even in the dosages in Brain Force Plus,

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,000
or perhaps a less overpriced pill,

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,840
uh, it has been proven by studies to suggest an increase in, uh, mental alertness and memory.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,180
Alpha-GPC is also most commonly derived from soy.

81
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,180
Probably should have looked that up on Google before you made the video, Paul.

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,180
Then again, Google are a leftist cabal that's out to get you, so I can see why you wouldn't trust them.

83
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,100
In this review of Brain Force Plus by a Nootropics website,

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,980
aka a place where people actually look at supplements in a little more detail than Paul has,

85
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,120
the author actually is a little bit disappointed by the Alpha-GPC,

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
citing citricoline as a better chemical for the same job.

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,660
The review is, however, a huge fan of the phosphatidylserine in the pills,

88
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,360
claiming, and I quote,

89
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,660
But why didn't Paul mention the phosphatidylserine in the pills?

90
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,160
I mean, if I was trying to justify shilling for overpriced pills,

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,200
I'd probably mention the substance that people say is great and

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,360
not the bits that people were actually a bit disappointed by in reviews.

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,040
But Paul couldn't do that, could he?

94
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,560
Firstly, because phosphatidylserine is too hard for him to pronounce.

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,940
But secondly, because phosphatidylserine is derived from soy.

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
We love seeing it in Brain Force,

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,160
although the 81mg dosage is unusual and a little weak.

98
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,200
That's a little bit embarrassing, isn't it, Paul?

99
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,980
Even the positive reviews of Brain Force wish you'd put more soy in it.

100
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,640
Paul. Friend. Love.

101
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
Salt of the Earth.

102
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
Just come clean.

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,360
The soy isn't in there to balance out the good bits.

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
The soy is the good bits,

105
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,640
and it's commonly used to make the other good bits.

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,040
And you're just making it worse and digging the hole deeper

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,360
by trying to pass the whole thing off as a joke

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,040
while getting very mad,

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,360
the way you wouldn't be if it was a joke.

110
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Paul, I know admitting weakness is against your religion,

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,520
conservatism,

112
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
but it actually takes a tremendous amount of courage to admit that

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
you can do better and perhaps could have done some more research.

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,320
Maybe if you take enough of that Alpha GPC you seem to love so much,

115
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,480
you'll finally be up to the task of admitting that you can do better than this.

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,800
Or you can go back to screaming about me in a wig to sell underdosed, overpriced pills

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
whose prime ingredients are made from soy.

118
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,080
You know, it's your choice, really. It's a free country.

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,600
For now.
