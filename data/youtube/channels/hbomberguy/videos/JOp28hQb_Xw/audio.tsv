0	2500	You might have noticed that friend of the show, Pajama Watso,
2500	5380	has been getting some criticisms of the soy video he made.
5380	8880	For example, that it's a lie peddled to an undiscerning audience
8880	12800	based on bad science that he got from someone who went on to say that they think he's wrong.
12800	16980	But Paul's a professional journalist, so, of course, in responding to these criticisms,
16980	21320	he took the intellectual high road of putting on a wig and screaming at a camera
21320	24240	while making vague allusions to my video on the topic.
24240	28080	Let me demonstrate this in an obnoxious 30-minute YouTube response video!
28540	31240	Editor-at-large of Infowars.com there,
31240	35740	clearly behaving like someone who definitely isn't mad that they got owned online
35740	39000	and just wants to have a reasonable conversation about the facts.
39000	41200	First things first, hey, thanks for the shout-out, Paul.
41200	43580	I love being acknowledged by my peers online.
43580	47040	It makes me feel powerful, virile, even.
47040	51000	You can't bottle that feeling, and I know because you've tried!
51000	53180	Secondly, what's most fascinating about this comment
53180	56720	is that it's the closest I think I've seen someone come to admitting that they've lost.
56740	62660	If I'd made even a minor error that was easy to debunk or respond to in my 30-minute-long video,
62660	65280	Paul would have done that, wouldn't he?
65280	69300	He'd have gone in so hard on me, just rough and uncensored!
69300	73500	He'd have just gone to town on me with hisâ€”with his soy-encrusted tongue!
73500	77760	But it appears that I owned him so hard with such bulletproof reasoning
77760	81060	that he didn't even mention me or my video directly,
81060	83380	despite the fact that we have mutual friends,
83380	87020	so I know he's seen the video, and I know it really pissed him off.
87020	89720	In order to look like he has the intellectual upper hand here,
89720	92640	he has to make sure the only contact his audience has with my video,
92640	97440	in which I cite evidence and statistics and studies and make a couple of silly jokes
97440	102820	but ultimately come down on the side of having an actual, reasonable discussion about the data,
102820	105860	is him dressed in a wig acting like this.
105860	109000	I guess it's easy to win a fight with an opponent made of straw.
109000	113240	Seriously, this is how much displacement he had to do to bring my work down to a level
113240	115020	he feels he can beat.
115020	119080	I guess when you have trouble pronouncing the word milliliter when it's written in front of you?
119080	119900	Millimeter!
119900	124040	You're only really capable of winning arguments with yourself in a wig.
124040	129340	But I've noticed a certain unhealthy power around Paul's eyes lately.
129340	133260	I've noticed he might be missing out on one of the most important health products of all.
133260	137100	It appears that sad boy Paul is suffering from fact deficiency.
137100	139300	Let's take a look at some of the new claims that Paul made
139300	143460	while trying to defend the supplement he sells to keep the lights on, Brain Force Plus.
143460	147040	Some people say I'm a hypocrite because Brain Force contains soy.
147040	150040	Well, Brain Force also contains alpha-GPC.
150040	150680	Lots of it.
150680	152840	Alpha-GPC increases libido.
152840	153500	How much?
153500	156640	Well, just ask this 79-year-old Italian man.
156640	161340	He went from a doddering pensioner to a rampaging sex chad virtually overnight.
161340	165320	We had to put a bit of soy in Brain Force just to balance it out.
165320	168520	That's huge if it turns out to be true!
168540	169900	Shame it isn't, though.
169900	172980	Firstly, by overnight, Paul means six weeks.
172980	174900	That's like 40 overnights.
174900	177120	You can even see it in the screenshot he shows you.
177120	182420	Secondly, the man was taking alpha-GPC in order to try and reduce the kinds of memory loss that come with old age.
182420	185500	He could have been taking up to 1,200 milligrams a day.
185500	192120	For reference, Paul's daily two capsules of Brain Force Plus will net him about 156 milligrams of alpha-GPC a day.
192120	195460	So if you want, you too can replicate the effects this man had
195460	199540	by taking just 16 Brain Force Plus pills a day,
199540	202340	which is eight times the recommended dose,
202340	205380	and also, for the record, literally half a bottle.
205380	212060	By the way, just one bottle of that stuff retails on the InfoWars website for $39.95.
212060	217280	So just to take the dosage this guy was getting for the six weeks that Paul is pretending was overnight,
217280	220780	it'll cost you $838 and change.
220780	222360	Sounds like a bargain to me.
222360	228780	Yeah, to hell with those soy boys improving their lives with minor changes in their dietary decisions.
228780	230860	Oh, God. Idiots.
230860	235280	I'll be a real man once I've taken all 16 of my daily pills.
235280	238200	Yeah, get that down, yeah, that'll make you into a real alpha male.
238920	241160	That'll be $20 a day, please.
241160	246700	Incidentally, you can find alpha-GPC supplements on Amazon that have 300 milligrams in them per pill,
246700	250040	which is double what you get in two of Brain Force Plus,
250060	254700	and they come in packs of 120 pills for $29.95.
254700	258580	I'm beginning to think that InfoWars is some kind of scam
258580	262540	in order to keep Alex Jones in Rolexes at the expense of his audience.
262540	265340	Let's not rag on Paul too much just yet, though.
265340	270040	Alpha-GPC probably is good for you, and even in the dosages in Brain Force Plus,
270040	273000	or perhaps a less overpriced pill,
273000	278840	uh, it has been proven by studies to suggest an increase in, uh, mental alertness and memory.
279800	283180	Alpha-GPC is also most commonly derived from soy.
286380	291180	Probably should have looked that up on Google before you made the video, Paul.
292800	298180	Then again, Google are a leftist cabal that's out to get you, so I can see why you wouldn't trust them.
298180	301100	In this review of Brain Force Plus by a Nootropics website,
301100	305980	aka a place where people actually look at supplements in a little more detail than Paul has,
305980	309120	the author actually is a little bit disappointed by the Alpha-GPC,
309120	312320	citing citricoline as a better chemical for the same job.
312320	316660	The review is, however, a huge fan of the phosphatidylserine in the pills,
316660	318360	claiming, and I quote,
322580	325660	But why didn't Paul mention the phosphatidylserine in the pills?
325660	329160	I mean, if I was trying to justify shilling for overpriced pills,
329160	332200	I'd probably mention the substance that people say is great and
332200	335360	not the bits that people were actually a bit disappointed by in reviews.
336080	338040	But Paul couldn't do that, could he?
339100	342560	Firstly, because phosphatidylserine is too hard for him to pronounce.
342560	346940	But secondly, because phosphatidylserine is derived from soy.
350400	352600	We love seeing it in Brain Force,
352600	356160	although the 81mg dosage is unusual and a little weak.
356160	358200	That's a little bit embarrassing, isn't it, Paul?
358200	361980	Even the positive reviews of Brain Force wish you'd put more soy in it.
361980	364640	Paul. Friend. Love.
364640	366080	Salt of the Earth.
366080	367760	Just come clean.
367760	371360	The soy isn't in there to balance out the good bits.
371360	373520	The soy is the good bits,
373520	376640	and it's commonly used to make the other good bits.
376640	379040	And you're just making it worse and digging the hole deeper
379040	381360	by trying to pass the whole thing off as a joke
381360	383040	while getting very mad,
383040	385360	the way you wouldn't be if it was a joke.
385360	388240	Paul, I know admitting weakness is against your religion,
388240	389520	conservatism,
389520	393120	but it actually takes a tremendous amount of courage to admit that
393120	396560	you can do better and perhaps could have done some more research.
396560	400320	Maybe if you take enough of that Alpha GPC you seem to love so much,
400320	404480	you'll finally be up to the task of admitting that you can do better than this.
404480	408800	Or you can go back to screaming about me in a wig to sell underdosed, overpriced pills
408800	411040	whose prime ingredients are made from soy.
411040	414080	You know, it's your choice, really. It's a free country.
414080	415600	For now.
