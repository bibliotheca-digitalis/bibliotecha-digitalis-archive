00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
You might have noticed that friend of the show, Pajama Watso,

00:02.500 --> 00:05.380
has been getting some criticisms of the soy video he made.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.880
For example, that it's a lie peddled to an undiscerning audience

00:08.880 --> 00:12.800
based on bad science that he got from someone who went on to say that they think he's wrong.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.980
But Paul's a professional journalist, so, of course, in responding to these criticisms,

00:16.980 --> 00:21.320
he took the intellectual high road of putting on a wig and screaming at a camera

00:21.320 --> 00:24.240
while making vague allusions to my video on the topic.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.080
Let me demonstrate this in an obnoxious 30-minute YouTube response video!

00:28.540 --> 00:31.240
Editor-at-large of Infowars.com there,

00:31.240 --> 00:35.740
clearly behaving like someone who definitely isn't mad that they got owned online

00:35.740 --> 00:39.000
and just wants to have a reasonable conversation about the facts.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.200
First things first, hey, thanks for the shout-out, Paul.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.580
I love being acknowledged by my peers online.

00:43.580 --> 00:47.040
It makes me feel powerful, virile, even.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.000
You can't bottle that feeling, and I know because you've tried!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.180
Secondly, what's most fascinating about this comment

00:53.180 --> 00:56.720
is that it's the closest I think I've seen someone come to admitting that they've lost.

00:56.740 --> 01:02.660
If I'd made even a minor error that was easy to debunk or respond to in my 30-minute-long video,

01:02.660 --> 01:05.280
Paul would have done that, wouldn't he?

01:05.280 --> 01:09.300
He'd have gone in so hard on me, just rough and uncensored!

01:09.300 --> 01:13.500
He'd have just gone to town on me with hisâ€”with his soy-encrusted tongue!

01:13.500 --> 01:17.760
But it appears that I owned him so hard with such bulletproof reasoning

01:17.760 --> 01:21.060
that he didn't even mention me or my video directly,

01:21.060 --> 01:23.380
despite the fact that we have mutual friends,

01:23.380 --> 01:27.020
so I know he's seen the video, and I know it really pissed him off.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.720
In order to look like he has the intellectual upper hand here,

01:29.720 --> 01:32.640
he has to make sure the only contact his audience has with my video,

01:32.640 --> 01:37.440
in which I cite evidence and statistics and studies and make a couple of silly jokes

01:37.440 --> 01:42.820
but ultimately come down on the side of having an actual, reasonable discussion about the data,

01:42.820 --> 01:45.860
is him dressed in a wig acting like this.

01:45.860 --> 01:49.000
I guess it's easy to win a fight with an opponent made of straw.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.240
Seriously, this is how much displacement he had to do to bring my work down to a level

01:53.240 --> 01:55.020
he feels he can beat.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.080
I guess when you have trouble pronouncing the word milliliter when it's written in front of you?

01:59.080 --> 01:59.900
Millimeter!

01:59.900 --> 02:04.040
You're only really capable of winning arguments with yourself in a wig.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.340
But I've noticed a certain unhealthy power around Paul's eyes lately.

02:09.340 --> 02:13.260
I've noticed he might be missing out on one of the most important health products of all.

02:13.260 --> 02:17.100
It appears that sad boy Paul is suffering from fact deficiency.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.300
Let's take a look at some of the new claims that Paul made

02:19.300 --> 02:23.460
while trying to defend the supplement he sells to keep the lights on, Brain Force Plus.

02:23.460 --> 02:27.040
Some people say I'm a hypocrite because Brain Force contains soy.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.040
Well, Brain Force also contains alpha-GPC.

02:30.040 --> 02:30.680
Lots of it.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.840
Alpha-GPC increases libido.

02:32.840 --> 02:33.500
How much?

02:33.500 --> 02:36.640
Well, just ask this 79-year-old Italian man.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.340
He went from a doddering pensioner to a rampaging sex chad virtually overnight.

02:41.340 --> 02:45.320
We had to put a bit of soy in Brain Force just to balance it out.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.520
That's huge if it turns out to be true!

02:48.540 --> 02:49.900
Shame it isn't, though.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.980
Firstly, by overnight, Paul means six weeks.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.900
That's like 40 overnights.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.120
You can even see it in the screenshot he shows you.

02:57.120 --> 03:02.420
Secondly, the man was taking alpha-GPC in order to try and reduce the kinds of memory loss that come with old age.

03:02.420 --> 03:05.500
He could have been taking up to 1,200 milligrams a day.

03:05.500 --> 03:12.120
For reference, Paul's daily two capsules of Brain Force Plus will net him about 156 milligrams of alpha-GPC a day.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.460
So if you want, you too can replicate the effects this man had

03:15.460 --> 03:19.540
by taking just 16 Brain Force Plus pills a day,

03:19.540 --> 03:22.340
which is eight times the recommended dose,

03:22.340 --> 03:25.380
and also, for the record, literally half a bottle.

03:25.380 --> 03:32.060
By the way, just one bottle of that stuff retails on the InfoWars website for $39.95.

03:32.060 --> 03:37.280
So just to take the dosage this guy was getting for the six weeks that Paul is pretending was overnight,

03:37.280 --> 03:40.780
it'll cost you $838 and change.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.360
Sounds like a bargain to me.

03:42.360 --> 03:48.780
Yeah, to hell with those soy boys improving their lives with minor changes in their dietary decisions.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.860
Oh, God. Idiots.

03:50.860 --> 03:55.280
I'll be a real man once I've taken all 16 of my daily pills.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.200
Yeah, get that down, yeah, that'll make you into a real alpha male.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.160
That'll be $20 a day, please.

04:01.160 --> 04:06.700
Incidentally, you can find alpha-GPC supplements on Amazon that have 300 milligrams in them per pill,

04:06.700 --> 04:10.040
which is double what you get in two of Brain Force Plus,

04:10.060 --> 04:14.700
and they come in packs of 120 pills for $29.95.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.580
I'm beginning to think that InfoWars is some kind of scam

04:18.580 --> 04:22.540
in order to keep Alex Jones in Rolexes at the expense of his audience.

04:22.540 --> 04:25.340
Let's not rag on Paul too much just yet, though.

04:25.340 --> 04:30.040
Alpha-GPC probably is good for you, and even in the dosages in Brain Force Plus,

04:30.040 --> 04:33.000
or perhaps a less overpriced pill,

04:33.000 --> 04:38.840
uh, it has been proven by studies to suggest an increase in, uh, mental alertness and memory.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.180
Alpha-GPC is also most commonly derived from soy.

04:46.380 --> 04:51.180
Probably should have looked that up on Google before you made the video, Paul.

04:52.800 --> 04:58.180
Then again, Google are a leftist cabal that's out to get you, so I can see why you wouldn't trust them.

04:58.180 --> 05:01.100
In this review of Brain Force Plus by a Nootropics website,

05:01.100 --> 05:05.980
aka a place where people actually look at supplements in a little more detail than Paul has,

05:05.980 --> 05:09.120
the author actually is a little bit disappointed by the Alpha-GPC,

05:09.120 --> 05:12.320
citing citricoline as a better chemical for the same job.

05:12.320 --> 05:16.660
The review is, however, a huge fan of the phosphatidylserine in the pills,

05:16.660 --> 05:18.360
claiming, and I quote,

05:22.580 --> 05:25.660
But why didn't Paul mention the phosphatidylserine in the pills?

05:25.660 --> 05:29.160
I mean, if I was trying to justify shilling for overpriced pills,

05:29.160 --> 05:32.200
I'd probably mention the substance that people say is great and

05:32.200 --> 05:35.360
not the bits that people were actually a bit disappointed by in reviews.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.040
But Paul couldn't do that, could he?

05:39.100 --> 05:42.560
Firstly, because phosphatidylserine is too hard for him to pronounce.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.940
But secondly, because phosphatidylserine is derived from soy.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.600
We love seeing it in Brain Force,

05:52.600 --> 05:56.160
although the 81mg dosage is unusual and a little weak.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.200
That's a little bit embarrassing, isn't it, Paul?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.980
Even the positive reviews of Brain Force wish you'd put more soy in it.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.640
Paul. Friend. Love.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.080
Salt of the Earth.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.760
Just come clean.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.360
The soy isn't in there to balance out the good bits.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.520
The soy is the good bits,

06:13.520 --> 06:16.640
and it's commonly used to make the other good bits.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.040
And you're just making it worse and digging the hole deeper

06:19.040 --> 06:21.360
by trying to pass the whole thing off as a joke

06:21.360 --> 06:23.040
while getting very mad,

06:23.040 --> 06:25.360
the way you wouldn't be if it was a joke.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.240
Paul, I know admitting weakness is against your religion,

06:28.240 --> 06:29.520
conservatism,

06:29.520 --> 06:33.120
but it actually takes a tremendous amount of courage to admit that

06:33.120 --> 06:36.560
you can do better and perhaps could have done some more research.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.320
Maybe if you take enough of that Alpha GPC you seem to love so much,

06:40.320 --> 06:44.480
you'll finally be up to the task of admitting that you can do better than this.

06:44.480 --> 06:48.800
Or you can go back to screaming about me in a wig to sell underdosed, overpriced pills

06:48.800 --> 06:51.040
whose prime ingredients are made from soy.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.080
You know, it's your choice, really. It's a free country.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.600
For now.
