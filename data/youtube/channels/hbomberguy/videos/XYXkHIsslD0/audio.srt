1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hey, how's it going? Let's talk about what it's like eating tons of soy for two months.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,800
First, I should probably give you some background on what I normally eat.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,920
Basically, whatever. Like, whatever I feel like eating at the time or when I'm hungry.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,560
So, I'm not the most unhealthy of people. I tend to fluctuate between 11 and 12 stone,

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:30,640
which is like 160 to 180 pounds. I think I've got that right. Might be 150 to 170. I don't know. We

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
don't do pounds here. So, sometimes I'll eat, like, really healthily for a couple days and

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,200
sometimes I'll eat, like, a full, like, bag of Doritos for a meal. And sometimes I'll eat one

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,960
really, really big meal a day and nothing else. So, my metabolism is apparently really good because

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
it's compensated pretty well for the fact that I'm not very good at this whole food thing.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:04,960
Back when I was an IT engineer, I tried to get really healthy for a while. I basically ate

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,320
nothing but fruits and a couple of specific vegetables, like peppers, kidney beans, and just

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,840
lentils and spinach. And that was about it. That was just all I ate for, like, every meal of the day.

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,200
And I got super healthy for a while. I lost tons of weight. I felt really good. And then I went out

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,640
for fish and chips with some friends, like, once. And as soon as I got home, I immediately had to

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,520
have a nap for, like, two hours. And I realized that what I was doing was I was being so, like,

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,920
rigid in exactly what I was eating that I was training my body to be unprepared for

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
anything remotely fatty or sugary and it just messed with me. So, I kind of started eating

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,080
normally afterwards and sort of lived in fear of going on any kinds of diet of any kind afterwards.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,680
And apart from whatever amounts of soy that you get in normal people food, I haven't intentionally

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,120
eaten anything soy-based for most of my life. I've never really eaten anything vegan-y or tofu-y

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,320
before. When I was about 22, I went in to get a blood test because I was really worried about

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,920
testosterone stuff at the time, and my results came back really high for both T and DHT.

23
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,120
And, uh, that's actually why you're, you know, I'm going to go bold in the next 12 to 15 minutes

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,760
because, uh, that's what having high testosterone can do, although it's disputable. But I like to think

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,880
that's why. I love bringing this up, you know. Compared to me, like, 78% of the human male

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,440
population are low T-betas, and yet I look like this! It's almost as if endocrinology is a little

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,920
bit more complicated than what Davis Aurini and his science advisor looked up on the internet in

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
five minutes. Speaking of Davis, he actually left a comment on the last video that I want to read

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,720
out now. God, you're bitchy like a woman. Imagine being almost 40 years old, like, that close to

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
the halfway point of the cosmic human miracle that is your life, the one that you get, and spending

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,400
it arguing in the comments of YouTube videos on the internet. I want to feel sorry for Davis, but

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
it's just too funny. Actually, hold on one second. I'm gonna check if it's not, like, a parody account or something.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, it's real! The fact I had to check to see that that was just a parody of Davis

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,720
probably says quite a lot. You know, when I came up with that character that was sort of making fun

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
of people like him, but especially him, a couple of years ago when he's running around with a sword,

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,800
I thought, that's a bit much. They're not that silly. But no, as of two months ago, I checked

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,080
Davis's channel, and there he is looking like a slightly microwaved cypher from the Matrix

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
reviewing a sword that he bought online for, like, $500.

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,520
Oh yeah, I bet I look so badass right now.

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you want some cantaloupe? I cut up a lot of melons making this video.

41
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Hi Davis, by the way. I know you're gonna watch this, so, uh, maybe leave a better complaint in

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,200
the comments this time. That said, the testosterone results I got were years ago now. I was maybe

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,960
thinking of getting, like, a before and after test when I was doing this experiment, but doctors are

44
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,600
really, really busy now, especially thanks to the policies that people like Paul voted for,

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,080
and I didn't want to waste more of their time to get extra research done on a YouTube video.

46
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,520
That felt kind of disrespectful of their time. So, for the soy boy diet, I basically took everything

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,560
that was meat, eggs, or dairy, and replaced it with some kind of, uh, soy-based equivalent. So,

48
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,360
I had a lot of soy-sages, a lot of soy-gers. That's not a real thing.

49
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,640
And tons of soy milk. I don't actually drink that much milk normally. I think milk's

50
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,280
rubbish, but in coffee, I have milk, so I replaced that with soy milk. It tasted really nice,

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,240
by the way. That was the first thing I noticed. Soy milk has a really, like, nice taste to it.

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
I avoided all the vegetarian foods that are made of stuff like corn. Corn food is, like,

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,720
some kind of fungus and also egg albumin that's been cultivated a certain way. Apparently,

54
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,000
it tastes good, but it sounds awful, and there's no soy in it, to my knowledge, so I ignored all

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,480
of that. I also obviously just ate, you know, regular tofu that I'd bought and cooked different

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,240
ways. The initial barrier to tofu, by the way, is taste. Tofu in its nascent state is tasteless,

57
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,360
smells a little bit weird, and wet. You have to drain it or press it to get all of the water out.

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,200
You have to put in a lot more effort just to get an actual taste out of it. However,

59
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,080
people usually use that as a way of comparing it to meat and showing that it's less good,

60
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,920
but actually, after doing some looking into this over the course of this stuff, I've realised that

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,360
that's not quite a fair comparison. Like, all the meat that you buy in a store has been flavoured

62
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,720
or processed in some way to give it a sense of taste. You can't just cut a bacon-sized slice

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
off a pig and fry it. That will probably not taste that great. Anything that's been processed or

64
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,680
cured, that's what you're tasting in the meat when you eat it. You're not actually just, you know,

65
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,480
there isn't a nascent good taste to animals, it turns out. We have to make it taste all right.

66
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,640
With the sausages, the first thing I noticed was that they were incredibly similar to regular

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,680
sausages because the actual meat wasn't the thing you were tasting in sausages. You were actually

68
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,600
tasting all of the fun herbs and stuff that had been mixed in with it. And that stuff tastes nice

69
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,000
even when there's no actual meat involved, it turns out. So I had a pretty okay time on this.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,480
Something I got really into eating right away was I would just cut up some tofu and microwave it

71
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,680
with these chilli kidney beans that you can buy at the co-op and I would just eat that for a meal

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
and it was really quick to make and also it was really, really filling. So I had a good time with

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
that. I wouldn't cook that for someone else, that's, you know, that'd be rubbish, but I got

74
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,760
into eating tons of that right away because it was so quick and simple and it satisfied the tofu

75
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,800
requirements for this diet. I mostly stuck to it pretty fine. I had a couple of times where I broke

76
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,440
it on purpose because I was eating with, like, family for Christmas or New Year's and I couldn't

77
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,960
be bothered to, like, bring a soy chicken to Christmas dinner. Actually, I think the most

78
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,200
disturbing thing about my family was how when I told them about this thing they were like,

79
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,640
yeah, that's, that's something he would do. Like, my family have come to expect this sort of thing

80
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,440
from me and it's a little bit worrying, to be honest. My initial starting weight was 13 stone

81
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,200
and one pound, but that was while I was carrying a Canon C100 with a 24-105mm lens, which is actually

82
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
pretty hefty, but I really wanted to do the shot where I was looking down at the scale while I was

83
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,280
weighing myself. This is my mother's bathroom, by the way, I don't own a scale. What am I, a

84
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,680
functioning adult? To get my actual weight I decided to just weigh my camera again on the

85
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,360
same scale, which didn't work because it's not heavy enough, so I weighed it on a kitchen scale.

86
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:57,440
All right, 2,543 grams. That's 5.6 pounds. 183 take away 5.6 is 177.4 pounds, which is a lot

87
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,080
for me, actually. After doing the diet for two months, I'm not going to give you all that rigmarole

88
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,200
again. I weighed 11 stone and 2 pounds, so 156 pounds. So eating a bunch of soy made me lose

89
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,400
23 pounds without having to do anything? That's a pretty significant difference for just a slight

90
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,480
change in what I was eating. Imagine what a difference it would have made if I'd bothered

91
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,720
to exercise. In all the really compromising photos I took over the course of this diet,

92
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,560
I didn't notice any marked change in my actual shape. I didn't become more effeminate in any

93
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,560
way that was measurable, and I didn't grow breasts any larger than the ones that I already

94
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,160
have. I also didn't get significantly fitter or have that much more energy than I normally had

95
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,800
either, so it turns out that soybeans aren't magical. Basically I proved exactly what everyone

96
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,600
expected this would prove in the most boring and straightforward way possible. It turns out that

97
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,160
soybeans are just a kind of bean that you can eat, and it doesn't make that much of a difference.

98
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,240
Great. Hooray. This is why I didn't bring this up much in the main measured response video,

99
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,000
by the way, because it made no difference. There was, like, nothing really worth bringing up,

100
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,160
so I thought I'd save it for this little thing. At the very least, I didn't become weirdly airbrushed

101
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,120
or turn red like Alex Jones' supplements seemed to do for him. Watch out for that, by the way,

102
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,720
Paul. I think by far the most substantive change I've noticed is an increased prevalence in what

103
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,040
Reddit likes to call the ghost poop, which is you go to the bathroom, and then when you wipe,

104
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,360
you discover you didn't really have to because it came out in one solid, contiguous, beautiful piece.

105
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,760
I wouldn't call that a ghost poop, by the way, Reddit. Um, I would call that when you, uh,

106
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,080
take a shit and you don't need to flush because it went down the drain all on its own.

107
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,320
I don't think tofu is that much healthier than meat. I mean, obviously processed meats have been

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
linked to an increase in cancer risk, but with the kind of meat you can get at a butcher, I don't

109
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,000
think there's a huge difference health-wise. That said, soy milk is way better than regular milk.

110
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,360
Regular milk is garbage. Don't even get me start—I—I got myself started. Milk is, like,

111
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,240
just absolutely rubbish. Humans have been lactose intolerant for most of our history. Like,

112
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
the ability to drink milk is something we only really developed, like, 7,500 years ago, and even

113
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,880
then, tons of humans are still lactose intolerant. It's ridiculous. And then it still had shit in it

114
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,640
that would be, like, poisonous to drink. Like, it made people really sick anyway until Louis Pasteur

115
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,000
came along and invented pasteurization. I wonder where he got that name from. And then it was

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,400
finally mostly safe for some humans to drink milk. The fact that we still drank milk prior to the

117
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,760
1860s, where we haven't developed a way of making it not poisonous, speaks volumes as to both the

118
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,640
rubbishness of milk and to why humans are just rubbish. Soy milk, on the other hand, is low in fat,

119
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,040
high in protein and vitamins, contains zero cholesterol, uh, it tastes great in my coffee,

120
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,560
which is all I drink milk for anyway, because milk is weird. Oh, and it's not full of estrogen.

121
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,840
Oh, by the way, did I mention that regular milk is full of estrogen? Not, you know,

122
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:13,040
fakie fake planto phytoestrogen. Mammal estrogen. The kind that affects mammals?

123
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,680
You know, the cows make milk for baby calves, right? How's that for hormonal havoc, Kayla?

124
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,520
I don't know why I'm getting so annoyed about this. I think the main thing this taught me

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,040
was to bother to think about what I'm eating. Having to actually measure what's in food and

126
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,600
look at labels has caused me to think more about what I'm actually eating, which I really wasn't

127
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,720
before. I've never counted calories, I've never thought about fiber, carbohydrates, fat, protein,

128
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,280
anything like that before, and the modicum of research I had to do for making these videos has

129
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,000
caused me to go, well, if I actually thought about this just a little bit, I could vastly improve,

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,640
like, the actual state of my body. So there has kind of been a positive effect for this, but it's

131
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,320
nothing to do with the food itself. It's all just been the lessons I've learned over the course of

132
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
trying it. So I wouldn't really recommend the soy diet to anyone, you know, there's no spectacular

133
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,560
effects, but I would recommend looking into what you eat and how to improve it. I'm actually really

134
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,000
obsessed with responses to the Super Size Me documentary. Like, Morgan Spurlock, uh, made a

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,920
couple of, like, quite important methodological mistakes. So tons of shills for the fast food

136
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,400
industry or, like, weird paleo diet people have come out with these semi-legitimate criticisms in

137
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,520
order to push their own personal agenda. I think it's hilarious. There's this great documentary

138
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,520
called Fat Head, which I've seen more than most actual films, that basically, uh, takes a couple

139
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,680
of the legitimate problems with Super Size Me and turns them into, like, just,

140
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,240
["And here's why you should eat fucking steak every day!"

141
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,000
That topic is actually on the big board of weird niche subjects that I'd love to make a video about at some point,

142
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
so, uh, mention in the comments if you'd like me to do something like that. That's actually something

143
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,280
that I've noticed with YouTube skepticism for a while now. No one's bothered to mine the area of

144
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,320
health and diet science yet, which is bizarre because it's such a fantastic thing to delve into.

145
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,440
You know, like, uh, nutritionist is not a legally protected term, right? So you have Kayla Daniels'

146
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
everywhere, and they're, like, saying stuff that's really easy to make fun of and debunk. We've got

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
all kinds of stuff like that, and yet we're so busy talking about, you know, moon landing conspiracy

148
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,080
theories or feminists when there's this whole thing that we could be doing. I think that's great.

149
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,760
I'm also going to look into a book by Tim Ferriss called The 4-Hour Body, which I've heard is actually

150
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,400
fairly similar to the kind of diet I adopted a couple years ago when I got pretty healthy and

151
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,120
then had a weird experience with some fatty foods. Uh, apparently his diet, uh, suggests some kind of

152
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,760
cheat day where you eat a ton of calories and fat and stuff to sort of reset your metabolism

153
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,000
every now and then. I'd love to have a version of the stuff I ate then that actually works properly

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and lets me occasionally eat fatty things without having to have a nap afterwards. I think I might

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,400
start going to the gym more after this. Like, I joked earlier, imagine what it would have been

156
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:08,000
like if I'd bothered to exercise, and I actually quite liked imagining that. So, you know, I'll give

157
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
that a shot. Anyway, thanks for watching this quick update on all the weird stuff I've been putting

158
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,960
into my mouth. Normally at the end of my videos, I used to do readings of the credits, but then

159
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,680
unfortunately too many lovely people decided to help fund me making weird stuff like this, so the

160
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,080
credits started being super long. It's actually starting to affect the length and pacing of my

161
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,640
videos to a degree that I think is not good for the videos themselves, so I'm going to change it

162
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,680
over. Uh, this and one more time I'm going to do readings of the credits just so everyone who wants

163
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,400
to be in them has a chance to, and I can correct if I get the names wrong this time, and in future

164
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm going to have different rewards for backers at that level. So I'm going to do streams of me

165
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,200
editing the videos and some other stuff like that. If there's other stuff you think I should

166
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,840
do for backers like that, please let me know. But in the meantime, it's thanks for allowing me to

167
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,280
afford to spend the time, effort, and money doing ridiculous stuff like this. I'd really like to thank

219
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,240
much. It's absolutely amazing. I'm still shocked. I mean, I set up the reward where I read names out

220
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,880
because I thought like six people would ever do it, and here I am with too many that I can't

221
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,080
really do readings of the credits anymore without adding like 10 minutes to a video. It's amazing.
