00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Hey, how's it going? Let's talk about what it's like eating tons of soy for two months.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.800
First, I should probably give you some background on what I normally eat.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.920
Basically, whatever. Like, whatever I feel like eating at the time or when I'm hungry.

00:15.920 --> 00:22.560
So, I'm not the most unhealthy of people. I tend to fluctuate between 11 and 12 stone,

00:22.560 --> 00:30.640
which is like 160 to 180 pounds. I think I've got that right. Might be 150 to 170. I don't know. We

00:30.640 --> 00:34.480
don't do pounds here. So, sometimes I'll eat, like, really healthily for a couple days and

00:34.480 --> 00:41.200
sometimes I'll eat, like, a full, like, bag of Doritos for a meal. And sometimes I'll eat one

00:41.200 --> 00:46.960
really, really big meal a day and nothing else. So, my metabolism is apparently really good because

00:46.960 --> 00:50.480
it's compensated pretty well for the fact that I'm not very good at this whole food thing.

00:52.560 --> 01:04.960
Back when I was an IT engineer, I tried to get really healthy for a while. I basically ate

01:04.960 --> 01:12.320
nothing but fruits and a couple of specific vegetables, like peppers, kidney beans, and just

01:12.320 --> 01:17.840
lentils and spinach. And that was about it. That was just all I ate for, like, every meal of the day.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.200
And I got super healthy for a while. I lost tons of weight. I felt really good. And then I went out

01:23.200 --> 01:28.640
for fish and chips with some friends, like, once. And as soon as I got home, I immediately had to

01:28.640 --> 01:33.520
have a nap for, like, two hours. And I realized that what I was doing was I was being so, like,

01:34.080 --> 01:37.920
rigid in exactly what I was eating that I was training my body to be unprepared for

01:37.920 --> 01:42.320
anything remotely fatty or sugary and it just messed with me. So, I kind of started eating

01:42.320 --> 01:48.080
normally afterwards and sort of lived in fear of going on any kinds of diet of any kind afterwards.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.680
And apart from whatever amounts of soy that you get in normal people food, I haven't intentionally

01:53.680 --> 02:01.120
eaten anything soy-based for most of my life. I've never really eaten anything vegan-y or tofu-y

02:01.120 --> 02:06.320
before. When I was about 22, I went in to get a blood test because I was really worried about

02:06.320 --> 02:11.920
testosterone stuff at the time, and my results came back really high for both T and DHT.

02:11.920 --> 02:17.120
And, uh, that's actually why you're, you know, I'm going to go bold in the next 12 to 15 minutes

02:17.120 --> 02:23.760
because, uh, that's what having high testosterone can do, although it's disputable. But I like to think

02:23.760 --> 02:28.880
that's why. I love bringing this up, you know. Compared to me, like, 78% of the human male

02:28.880 --> 02:35.440
population are low T-betas, and yet I look like this! It's almost as if endocrinology is a little

02:35.440 --> 02:39.920
bit more complicated than what Davis Aurini and his science advisor looked up on the internet in

02:39.920 --> 02:43.440
five minutes. Speaking of Davis, he actually left a comment on the last video that I want to read

02:43.440 --> 02:52.720
out now. God, you're bitchy like a woman. Imagine being almost 40 years old, like, that close to

02:52.720 --> 02:58.720
the halfway point of the cosmic human miracle that is your life, the one that you get, and spending

02:58.720 --> 03:04.400
it arguing in the comments of YouTube videos on the internet. I want to feel sorry for Davis, but

03:04.400 --> 03:08.400
it's just too funny. Actually, hold on one second. I'm gonna check if it's not, like, a parody account or something.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.800
Yeah, it's real! The fact I had to check to see that that was just a parody of Davis

03:16.800 --> 03:20.720
probably says quite a lot. You know, when I came up with that character that was sort of making fun

03:20.720 --> 03:25.280
of people like him, but especially him, a couple of years ago when he's running around with a sword,

03:25.280 --> 03:30.800
I thought, that's a bit much. They're not that silly. But no, as of two months ago, I checked

03:30.800 --> 03:36.080
Davis's channel, and there he is looking like a slightly microwaved cypher from the Matrix

03:36.080 --> 03:39.920
reviewing a sword that he bought online for, like, $500.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.520
Oh yeah, I bet I look so badass right now.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.000
Do you want some cantaloupe? I cut up a lot of melons making this video.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.840
Hi Davis, by the way. I know you're gonna watch this, so, uh, maybe leave a better complaint in

03:59.840 --> 04:05.200
the comments this time. That said, the testosterone results I got were years ago now. I was maybe

04:05.200 --> 04:10.960
thinking of getting, like, a before and after test when I was doing this experiment, but doctors are

04:10.960 --> 04:15.600
really, really busy now, especially thanks to the policies that people like Paul voted for,

04:15.600 --> 04:22.080
and I didn't want to waste more of their time to get extra research done on a YouTube video.

04:22.080 --> 04:27.520
That felt kind of disrespectful of their time. So, for the soy boy diet, I basically took everything

04:27.520 --> 04:34.560
that was meat, eggs, or dairy, and replaced it with some kind of, uh, soy-based equivalent. So,

04:34.560 --> 04:39.360
I had a lot of soy-sages, a lot of soy-gers. That's not a real thing.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.640
And tons of soy milk. I don't actually drink that much milk normally. I think milk's

04:46.640 --> 04:51.280
rubbish, but in coffee, I have milk, so I replaced that with soy milk. It tasted really nice,

04:51.280 --> 04:56.240
by the way. That was the first thing I noticed. Soy milk has a really, like, nice taste to it.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.960
I avoided all the vegetarian foods that are made of stuff like corn. Corn food is, like,

05:02.080 --> 05:08.720
some kind of fungus and also egg albumin that's been cultivated a certain way. Apparently,

05:08.720 --> 05:14.000
it tastes good, but it sounds awful, and there's no soy in it, to my knowledge, so I ignored all

05:14.000 --> 05:18.480
of that. I also obviously just ate, you know, regular tofu that I'd bought and cooked different

05:18.480 --> 05:24.240
ways. The initial barrier to tofu, by the way, is taste. Tofu in its nascent state is tasteless,

05:24.880 --> 05:31.360
smells a little bit weird, and wet. You have to drain it or press it to get all of the water out.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.200
You have to put in a lot more effort just to get an actual taste out of it. However,

05:35.200 --> 05:40.080
people usually use that as a way of comparing it to meat and showing that it's less good,

05:40.080 --> 05:43.920
but actually, after doing some looking into this over the course of this stuff, I've realised that

05:43.920 --> 05:49.360
that's not quite a fair comparison. Like, all the meat that you buy in a store has been flavoured

05:49.360 --> 05:54.720
or processed in some way to give it a sense of taste. You can't just cut a bacon-sized slice

05:54.720 --> 05:59.360
off a pig and fry it. That will probably not taste that great. Anything that's been processed or

05:59.360 --> 06:03.680
cured, that's what you're tasting in the meat when you eat it. You're not actually just, you know,

06:03.680 --> 06:08.480
there isn't a nascent good taste to animals, it turns out. We have to make it taste all right.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.640
With the sausages, the first thing I noticed was that they were incredibly similar to regular

06:12.640 --> 06:17.680
sausages because the actual meat wasn't the thing you were tasting in sausages. You were actually

06:17.680 --> 06:23.600
tasting all of the fun herbs and stuff that had been mixed in with it. And that stuff tastes nice

06:23.600 --> 06:28.000
even when there's no actual meat involved, it turns out. So I had a pretty okay time on this.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.480
Something I got really into eating right away was I would just cut up some tofu and microwave it

06:32.480 --> 06:37.680
with these chilli kidney beans that you can buy at the co-op and I would just eat that for a meal

06:37.680 --> 06:42.240
and it was really quick to make and also it was really, really filling. So I had a good time with

06:42.240 --> 06:45.840
that. I wouldn't cook that for someone else, that's, you know, that'd be rubbish, but I got

06:45.840 --> 06:49.760
into eating tons of that right away because it was so quick and simple and it satisfied the tofu

06:49.760 --> 06:54.800
requirements for this diet. I mostly stuck to it pretty fine. I had a couple of times where I broke

06:54.800 --> 06:59.440
it on purpose because I was eating with, like, family for Christmas or New Year's and I couldn't

06:59.440 --> 07:06.960
be bothered to, like, bring a soy chicken to Christmas dinner. Actually, I think the most

07:06.960 --> 07:11.200
disturbing thing about my family was how when I told them about this thing they were like,

07:11.200 --> 07:16.640
yeah, that's, that's something he would do. Like, my family have come to expect this sort of thing

07:16.640 --> 07:23.440
from me and it's a little bit worrying, to be honest. My initial starting weight was 13 stone

07:23.440 --> 07:29.200
and one pound, but that was while I was carrying a Canon C100 with a 24-105mm lens, which is actually

07:29.200 --> 07:33.200
pretty hefty, but I really wanted to do the shot where I was looking down at the scale while I was

07:33.200 --> 07:37.280
weighing myself. This is my mother's bathroom, by the way, I don't own a scale. What am I, a

07:37.280 --> 07:41.680
functioning adult? To get my actual weight I decided to just weigh my camera again on the

07:41.680 --> 07:47.360
same scale, which didn't work because it's not heavy enough, so I weighed it on a kitchen scale.

07:47.360 --> 07:57.440
All right, 2,543 grams. That's 5.6 pounds. 183 take away 5.6 is 177.4 pounds, which is a lot

07:57.440 --> 08:02.080
for me, actually. After doing the diet for two months, I'm not going to give you all that rigmarole

08:02.080 --> 08:09.200
again. I weighed 11 stone and 2 pounds, so 156 pounds. So eating a bunch of soy made me lose

08:09.200 --> 08:14.400
23 pounds without having to do anything? That's a pretty significant difference for just a slight

08:14.400 --> 08:18.480
change in what I was eating. Imagine what a difference it would have made if I'd bothered

08:18.480 --> 08:22.720
to exercise. In all the really compromising photos I took over the course of this diet,

08:22.720 --> 08:28.560
I didn't notice any marked change in my actual shape. I didn't become more effeminate in any

08:28.560 --> 08:34.560
way that was measurable, and I didn't grow breasts any larger than the ones that I already

08:34.560 --> 08:40.160
have. I also didn't get significantly fitter or have that much more energy than I normally had

08:40.160 --> 08:44.800
either, so it turns out that soybeans aren't magical. Basically I proved exactly what everyone

08:44.800 --> 08:49.600
expected this would prove in the most boring and straightforward way possible. It turns out that

08:49.600 --> 08:56.160
soybeans are just a kind of bean that you can eat, and it doesn't make that much of a difference.

08:56.960 --> 09:02.240
Great. Hooray. This is why I didn't bring this up much in the main measured response video,

09:02.240 --> 09:06.000
by the way, because it made no difference. There was, like, nothing really worth bringing up,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.160
so I thought I'd save it for this little thing. At the very least, I didn't become weirdly airbrushed

09:10.160 --> 09:15.120
or turn red like Alex Jones' supplements seemed to do for him. Watch out for that, by the way,

09:15.120 --> 09:20.720
Paul. I think by far the most substantive change I've noticed is an increased prevalence in what

09:21.680 --> 09:27.040
Reddit likes to call the ghost poop, which is you go to the bathroom, and then when you wipe,

09:27.040 --> 09:33.360
you discover you didn't really have to because it came out in one solid, contiguous, beautiful piece.

09:33.920 --> 09:39.760
I wouldn't call that a ghost poop, by the way, Reddit. Um, I would call that when you, uh,

09:39.760 --> 09:44.080
take a shit and you don't need to flush because it went down the drain all on its own.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.320
I don't think tofu is that much healthier than meat. I mean, obviously processed meats have been

09:48.320 --> 09:52.080
linked to an increase in cancer risk, but with the kind of meat you can get at a butcher, I don't

09:52.080 --> 09:58.000
think there's a huge difference health-wise. That said, soy milk is way better than regular milk.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.360
Regular milk is garbage. Don't even get me start—I—I got myself started. Milk is, like,

10:03.360 --> 10:08.240
just absolutely rubbish. Humans have been lactose intolerant for most of our history. Like,

10:08.240 --> 10:13.200
the ability to drink milk is something we only really developed, like, 7,500 years ago, and even

10:13.200 --> 10:18.880
then, tons of humans are still lactose intolerant. It's ridiculous. And then it still had shit in it

10:18.880 --> 10:24.640
that would be, like, poisonous to drink. Like, it made people really sick anyway until Louis Pasteur

10:24.640 --> 10:30.000
came along and invented pasteurization. I wonder where he got that name from. And then it was

10:30.000 --> 10:36.400
finally mostly safe for some humans to drink milk. The fact that we still drank milk prior to the

10:36.400 --> 10:41.760
1860s, where we haven't developed a way of making it not poisonous, speaks volumes as to both the

10:41.760 --> 10:48.640
rubbishness of milk and to why humans are just rubbish. Soy milk, on the other hand, is low in fat,

10:48.640 --> 10:55.040
high in protein and vitamins, contains zero cholesterol, uh, it tastes great in my coffee,

10:55.040 --> 11:00.560
which is all I drink milk for anyway, because milk is weird. Oh, and it's not full of estrogen.

11:00.560 --> 11:05.840
Oh, by the way, did I mention that regular milk is full of estrogen? Not, you know,

11:05.840 --> 11:13.040
fakie fake planto phytoestrogen. Mammal estrogen. The kind that affects mammals?

11:14.160 --> 11:21.680
You know, the cows make milk for baby calves, right? How's that for hormonal havoc, Kayla?

11:23.840 --> 11:27.520
I don't know why I'm getting so annoyed about this. I think the main thing this taught me

11:27.520 --> 11:33.040
was to bother to think about what I'm eating. Having to actually measure what's in food and

11:33.040 --> 11:37.600
look at labels has caused me to think more about what I'm actually eating, which I really wasn't

11:37.600 --> 11:42.720
before. I've never counted calories, I've never thought about fiber, carbohydrates, fat, protein,

11:42.720 --> 11:47.280
anything like that before, and the modicum of research I had to do for making these videos has

11:47.280 --> 11:52.000
caused me to go, well, if I actually thought about this just a little bit, I could vastly improve,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.640
like, the actual state of my body. So there has kind of been a positive effect for this, but it's

11:56.640 --> 12:00.320
nothing to do with the food itself. It's all just been the lessons I've learned over the course of

12:00.320 --> 12:05.600
trying it. So I wouldn't really recommend the soy diet to anyone, you know, there's no spectacular

12:05.600 --> 12:10.560
effects, but I would recommend looking into what you eat and how to improve it. I'm actually really

12:10.560 --> 12:16.000
obsessed with responses to the Super Size Me documentary. Like, Morgan Spurlock, uh, made a

12:16.000 --> 12:21.920
couple of, like, quite important methodological mistakes. So tons of shills for the fast food

12:21.920 --> 12:28.400
industry or, like, weird paleo diet people have come out with these semi-legitimate criticisms in

12:28.400 --> 12:33.520
order to push their own personal agenda. I think it's hilarious. There's this great documentary

12:33.520 --> 12:39.520
called Fat Head, which I've seen more than most actual films, that basically, uh, takes a couple

12:39.520 --> 12:43.680
of the legitimate problems with Super Size Me and turns them into, like, just,

12:43.680 --> 12:47.240
["And here's why you should eat fucking steak every day!"

12:47.240 --> 12:52.000
That topic is actually on the big board of weird niche subjects that I'd love to make a video about at some point,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.600
so, uh, mention in the comments if you'd like me to do something like that. That's actually something

12:55.600 --> 13:01.280
that I've noticed with YouTube skepticism for a while now. No one's bothered to mine the area of

13:01.280 --> 13:06.320
health and diet science yet, which is bizarre because it's such a fantastic thing to delve into.

13:06.320 --> 13:11.440
You know, like, uh, nutritionist is not a legally protected term, right? So you have Kayla Daniels'

13:11.440 --> 13:16.000
everywhere, and they're, like, saying stuff that's really easy to make fun of and debunk. We've got

13:16.000 --> 13:20.400
all kinds of stuff like that, and yet we're so busy talking about, you know, moon landing conspiracy

13:20.400 --> 13:26.080
theories or feminists when there's this whole thing that we could be doing. I think that's great.

13:26.080 --> 13:31.760
I'm also going to look into a book by Tim Ferriss called The 4-Hour Body, which I've heard is actually

13:31.760 --> 13:36.400
fairly similar to the kind of diet I adopted a couple years ago when I got pretty healthy and

13:36.400 --> 13:43.120
then had a weird experience with some fatty foods. Uh, apparently his diet, uh, suggests some kind of

13:43.120 --> 13:47.760
cheat day where you eat a ton of calories and fat and stuff to sort of reset your metabolism

13:47.760 --> 13:52.000
every now and then. I'd love to have a version of the stuff I ate then that actually works properly

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
and lets me occasionally eat fatty things without having to have a nap afterwards. I think I might

13:56.000 --> 14:00.400
start going to the gym more after this. Like, I joked earlier, imagine what it would have been

14:00.400 --> 14:08.000
like if I'd bothered to exercise, and I actually quite liked imagining that. So, you know, I'll give

14:08.000 --> 14:11.760
that a shot. Anyway, thanks for watching this quick update on all the weird stuff I've been putting

14:11.760 --> 14:16.960
into my mouth. Normally at the end of my videos, I used to do readings of the credits, but then

14:16.960 --> 14:23.680
unfortunately too many lovely people decided to help fund me making weird stuff like this, so the

14:23.680 --> 14:28.080
credits started being super long. It's actually starting to affect the length and pacing of my

14:28.080 --> 14:32.640
videos to a degree that I think is not good for the videos themselves, so I'm going to change it

14:32.640 --> 14:37.680
over. Uh, this and one more time I'm going to do readings of the credits just so everyone who wants

14:37.680 --> 14:42.400
to be in them has a chance to, and I can correct if I get the names wrong this time, and in future

14:42.400 --> 14:46.080
I'm going to have different rewards for backers at that level. So I'm going to do streams of me

14:46.080 --> 14:49.200
editing the videos and some other stuff like that. If there's other stuff you think I should

14:49.200 --> 14:53.840
do for backers like that, please let me know. But in the meantime, it's thanks for allowing me to

14:53.840 --> 15:01.280
afford to spend the time, effort, and money doing ridiculous stuff like this. I'd really like to thank

correction in the last video where I do the credits. Thank you very much. Seriously, thank you all so

21:19.040 --> 21:26.240
much. It's absolutely amazing. I'm still shocked. I mean, I set up the reward where I read names out

because I thought like six people would ever do it, and here I am with too many that I can't

really do readings of the credits anymore without adding like 10 minutes to a video. It's amazing.
