0	3680	Hey, how's it going? Let's talk about what it's like eating tons of soy for two months.
6320	8800	First, I should probably give you some background on what I normally eat.
10400	15920	Basically, whatever. Like, whatever I feel like eating at the time or when I'm hungry.
15920	22560	So, I'm not the most unhealthy of people. I tend to fluctuate between 11 and 12 stone,
22560	30640	which is like 160 to 180 pounds. I think I've got that right. Might be 150 to 170. I don't know. We
30640	34480	don't do pounds here. So, sometimes I'll eat, like, really healthily for a couple days and
34480	41200	sometimes I'll eat, like, a full, like, bag of Doritos for a meal. And sometimes I'll eat one
41200	46960	really, really big meal a day and nothing else. So, my metabolism is apparently really good because
46960	50480	it's compensated pretty well for the fact that I'm not very good at this whole food thing.
52560	64960	Back when I was an IT engineer, I tried to get really healthy for a while. I basically ate
64960	72320	nothing but fruits and a couple of specific vegetables, like peppers, kidney beans, and just
72320	77840	lentils and spinach. And that was about it. That was just all I ate for, like, every meal of the day.
77920	83200	And I got super healthy for a while. I lost tons of weight. I felt really good. And then I went out
83200	88640	for fish and chips with some friends, like, once. And as soon as I got home, I immediately had to
88640	93520	have a nap for, like, two hours. And I realized that what I was doing was I was being so, like,
94080	97920	rigid in exactly what I was eating that I was training my body to be unprepared for
97920	102320	anything remotely fatty or sugary and it just messed with me. So, I kind of started eating
102320	108080	normally afterwards and sort of lived in fear of going on any kinds of diet of any kind afterwards.
108080	113680	And apart from whatever amounts of soy that you get in normal people food, I haven't intentionally
113680	121120	eaten anything soy-based for most of my life. I've never really eaten anything vegan-y or tofu-y
121120	126320	before. When I was about 22, I went in to get a blood test because I was really worried about
126320	131920	testosterone stuff at the time, and my results came back really high for both T and DHT.
131920	137120	And, uh, that's actually why you're, you know, I'm going to go bold in the next 12 to 15 minutes
137120	143760	because, uh, that's what having high testosterone can do, although it's disputable. But I like to think
143760	148880	that's why. I love bringing this up, you know. Compared to me, like, 78% of the human male
148880	155440	population are low T-betas, and yet I look like this! It's almost as if endocrinology is a little
155440	159920	bit more complicated than what Davis Aurini and his science advisor looked up on the internet in
159920	163440	five minutes. Speaking of Davis, he actually left a comment on the last video that I want to read
163440	172720	out now. God, you're bitchy like a woman. Imagine being almost 40 years old, like, that close to
172720	178720	the halfway point of the cosmic human miracle that is your life, the one that you get, and spending
178720	184400	it arguing in the comments of YouTube videos on the internet. I want to feel sorry for Davis, but
184400	188400	it's just too funny. Actually, hold on one second. I'm gonna check if it's not, like, a parody account or something.
192240	196800	Yeah, it's real! The fact I had to check to see that that was just a parody of Davis
196800	200720	probably says quite a lot. You know, when I came up with that character that was sort of making fun
200720	205280	of people like him, but especially him, a couple of years ago when he's running around with a sword,
205280	210800	I thought, that's a bit much. They're not that silly. But no, as of two months ago, I checked
210800	216080	Davis's channel, and there he is looking like a slightly microwaved cypher from the Matrix
216080	219920	reviewing a sword that he bought online for, like, $500.
224960	227520	Oh yeah, I bet I look so badass right now.
229280	234000	Do you want some cantaloupe? I cut up a lot of melons making this video.
235440	239840	Hi Davis, by the way. I know you're gonna watch this, so, uh, maybe leave a better complaint in
239840	245200	the comments this time. That said, the testosterone results I got were years ago now. I was maybe
245200	250960	thinking of getting, like, a before and after test when I was doing this experiment, but doctors are
250960	255600	really, really busy now, especially thanks to the policies that people like Paul voted for,
255600	262080	and I didn't want to waste more of their time to get extra research done on a YouTube video.
262080	267520	That felt kind of disrespectful of their time. So, for the soy boy diet, I basically took everything
267520	274560	that was meat, eggs, or dairy, and replaced it with some kind of, uh, soy-based equivalent. So,
274560	279360	I had a lot of soy-sages, a lot of soy-gers. That's not a real thing.
282240	286640	And tons of soy milk. I don't actually drink that much milk normally. I think milk's
286640	291280	rubbish, but in coffee, I have milk, so I replaced that with soy milk. It tasted really nice,
291280	296240	by the way. That was the first thing I noticed. Soy milk has a really, like, nice taste to it.
296240	300960	I avoided all the vegetarian foods that are made of stuff like corn. Corn food is, like,
302080	308720	some kind of fungus and also egg albumin that's been cultivated a certain way. Apparently,
308720	314000	it tastes good, but it sounds awful, and there's no soy in it, to my knowledge, so I ignored all
314000	318480	of that. I also obviously just ate, you know, regular tofu that I'd bought and cooked different
318480	324240	ways. The initial barrier to tofu, by the way, is taste. Tofu in its nascent state is tasteless,
324880	331360	smells a little bit weird, and wet. You have to drain it or press it to get all of the water out.
331360	335200	You have to put in a lot more effort just to get an actual taste out of it. However,
335200	340080	people usually use that as a way of comparing it to meat and showing that it's less good,
340080	343920	but actually, after doing some looking into this over the course of this stuff, I've realised that
343920	349360	that's not quite a fair comparison. Like, all the meat that you buy in a store has been flavoured
349360	354720	or processed in some way to give it a sense of taste. You can't just cut a bacon-sized slice
354720	359360	off a pig and fry it. That will probably not taste that great. Anything that's been processed or
359360	363680	cured, that's what you're tasting in the meat when you eat it. You're not actually just, you know,
363680	368480	there isn't a nascent good taste to animals, it turns out. We have to make it taste all right.
368480	372640	With the sausages, the first thing I noticed was that they were incredibly similar to regular
372640	377680	sausages because the actual meat wasn't the thing you were tasting in sausages. You were actually
377680	383600	tasting all of the fun herbs and stuff that had been mixed in with it. And that stuff tastes nice
383600	388000	even when there's no actual meat involved, it turns out. So I had a pretty okay time on this.
388000	392480	Something I got really into eating right away was I would just cut up some tofu and microwave it
392480	397680	with these chilli kidney beans that you can buy at the co-op and I would just eat that for a meal
397680	402240	and it was really quick to make and also it was really, really filling. So I had a good time with
402240	405840	that. I wouldn't cook that for someone else, that's, you know, that'd be rubbish, but I got
405840	409760	into eating tons of that right away because it was so quick and simple and it satisfied the tofu
409760	414800	requirements for this diet. I mostly stuck to it pretty fine. I had a couple of times where I broke
414800	419440	it on purpose because I was eating with, like, family for Christmas or New Year's and I couldn't
419440	426960	be bothered to, like, bring a soy chicken to Christmas dinner. Actually, I think the most
426960	431200	disturbing thing about my family was how when I told them about this thing they were like,
431200	436640	yeah, that's, that's something he would do. Like, my family have come to expect this sort of thing
436640	443440	from me and it's a little bit worrying, to be honest. My initial starting weight was 13 stone
443440	449200	and one pound, but that was while I was carrying a Canon C100 with a 24-105mm lens, which is actually
449200	453200	pretty hefty, but I really wanted to do the shot where I was looking down at the scale while I was
453200	457280	weighing myself. This is my mother's bathroom, by the way, I don't own a scale. What am I, a
457280	461680	functioning adult? To get my actual weight I decided to just weigh my camera again on the
461680	467360	same scale, which didn't work because it's not heavy enough, so I weighed it on a kitchen scale.
467360	477440	All right, 2,543 grams. That's 5.6 pounds. 183 take away 5.6 is 177.4 pounds, which is a lot
477440	482080	for me, actually. After doing the diet for two months, I'm not going to give you all that rigmarole
482080	489200	again. I weighed 11 stone and 2 pounds, so 156 pounds. So eating a bunch of soy made me lose
489200	494400	23 pounds without having to do anything? That's a pretty significant difference for just a slight
494400	498480	change in what I was eating. Imagine what a difference it would have made if I'd bothered
498480	502720	to exercise. In all the really compromising photos I took over the course of this diet,
502720	508560	I didn't notice any marked change in my actual shape. I didn't become more effeminate in any
508560	514560	way that was measurable, and I didn't grow breasts any larger than the ones that I already
514560	520160	have. I also didn't get significantly fitter or have that much more energy than I normally had
520160	524800	either, so it turns out that soybeans aren't magical. Basically I proved exactly what everyone
524800	529600	expected this would prove in the most boring and straightforward way possible. It turns out that
529600	536160	soybeans are just a kind of bean that you can eat, and it doesn't make that much of a difference.
536960	542240	Great. Hooray. This is why I didn't bring this up much in the main measured response video,
542240	546000	by the way, because it made no difference. There was, like, nothing really worth bringing up,
546000	550160	so I thought I'd save it for this little thing. At the very least, I didn't become weirdly airbrushed
550160	555120	or turn red like Alex Jones' supplements seemed to do for him. Watch out for that, by the way,
555120	560720	Paul. I think by far the most substantive change I've noticed is an increased prevalence in what
561680	567040	Reddit likes to call the ghost poop, which is you go to the bathroom, and then when you wipe,
567040	573360	you discover you didn't really have to because it came out in one solid, contiguous, beautiful piece.
573920	579760	I wouldn't call that a ghost poop, by the way, Reddit. Um, I would call that when you, uh,
579760	584080	take a shit and you don't need to flush because it went down the drain all on its own.
584080	588320	I don't think tofu is that much healthier than meat. I mean, obviously processed meats have been
588320	592080	linked to an increase in cancer risk, but with the kind of meat you can get at a butcher, I don't
592080	598000	think there's a huge difference health-wise. That said, soy milk is way better than regular milk.
598000	603360	Regular milk is garbage. Don't even get me start—I—I got myself started. Milk is, like,
603360	608240	just absolutely rubbish. Humans have been lactose intolerant for most of our history. Like,
608240	613200	the ability to drink milk is something we only really developed, like, 7,500 years ago, and even
613200	618880	then, tons of humans are still lactose intolerant. It's ridiculous. And then it still had shit in it
618880	624640	that would be, like, poisonous to drink. Like, it made people really sick anyway until Louis Pasteur
624640	630000	came along and invented pasteurization. I wonder where he got that name from. And then it was
630000	636400	finally mostly safe for some humans to drink milk. The fact that we still drank milk prior to the
636400	641760	1860s, where we haven't developed a way of making it not poisonous, speaks volumes as to both the
641760	648640	rubbishness of milk and to why humans are just rubbish. Soy milk, on the other hand, is low in fat,
648640	655040	high in protein and vitamins, contains zero cholesterol, uh, it tastes great in my coffee,
655040	660560	which is all I drink milk for anyway, because milk is weird. Oh, and it's not full of estrogen.
660560	665840	Oh, by the way, did I mention that regular milk is full of estrogen? Not, you know,
665840	673040	fakie fake planto phytoestrogen. Mammal estrogen. The kind that affects mammals?
674160	681680	You know, the cows make milk for baby calves, right? How's that for hormonal havoc, Kayla?
683840	687520	I don't know why I'm getting so annoyed about this. I think the main thing this taught me
687520	693040	was to bother to think about what I'm eating. Having to actually measure what's in food and
693040	697600	look at labels has caused me to think more about what I'm actually eating, which I really wasn't
697600	702720	before. I've never counted calories, I've never thought about fiber, carbohydrates, fat, protein,
702720	707280	anything like that before, and the modicum of research I had to do for making these videos has
707280	712000	caused me to go, well, if I actually thought about this just a little bit, I could vastly improve,
712000	716640	like, the actual state of my body. So there has kind of been a positive effect for this, but it's
716640	720320	nothing to do with the food itself. It's all just been the lessons I've learned over the course of
720320	725600	trying it. So I wouldn't really recommend the soy diet to anyone, you know, there's no spectacular
725600	730560	effects, but I would recommend looking into what you eat and how to improve it. I'm actually really
730560	736000	obsessed with responses to the Super Size Me documentary. Like, Morgan Spurlock, uh, made a
736000	741920	couple of, like, quite important methodological mistakes. So tons of shills for the fast food
741920	748400	industry or, like, weird paleo diet people have come out with these semi-legitimate criticisms in
748400	753520	order to push their own personal agenda. I think it's hilarious. There's this great documentary
753520	759520	called Fat Head, which I've seen more than most actual films, that basically, uh, takes a couple
759520	763680	of the legitimate problems with Super Size Me and turns them into, like, just,
763680	767240	["And here's why you should eat fucking steak every day!"
767240	772000	That topic is actually on the big board of weird niche subjects that I'd love to make a video about at some point,
772000	775600	so, uh, mention in the comments if you'd like me to do something like that. That's actually something
775600	781280	that I've noticed with YouTube skepticism for a while now. No one's bothered to mine the area of
781280	786320	health and diet science yet, which is bizarre because it's such a fantastic thing to delve into.
786320	791440	You know, like, uh, nutritionist is not a legally protected term, right? So you have Kayla Daniels'
791440	796000	everywhere, and they're, like, saying stuff that's really easy to make fun of and debunk. We've got
796000	800400	all kinds of stuff like that, and yet we're so busy talking about, you know, moon landing conspiracy
800400	806080	theories or feminists when there's this whole thing that we could be doing. I think that's great.
806080	811760	I'm also going to look into a book by Tim Ferriss called The 4-Hour Body, which I've heard is actually
811760	816400	fairly similar to the kind of diet I adopted a couple years ago when I got pretty healthy and
816400	823120	then had a weird experience with some fatty foods. Uh, apparently his diet, uh, suggests some kind of
823120	827760	cheat day where you eat a ton of calories and fat and stuff to sort of reset your metabolism
827760	832000	every now and then. I'd love to have a version of the stuff I ate then that actually works properly
832000	836000	and lets me occasionally eat fatty things without having to have a nap afterwards. I think I might
836000	840400	start going to the gym more after this. Like, I joked earlier, imagine what it would have been
840400	848000	like if I'd bothered to exercise, and I actually quite liked imagining that. So, you know, I'll give
848000	851760	that a shot. Anyway, thanks for watching this quick update on all the weird stuff I've been putting
851760	856960	into my mouth. Normally at the end of my videos, I used to do readings of the credits, but then
856960	863680	unfortunately too many lovely people decided to help fund me making weird stuff like this, so the
863680	868080	credits started being super long. It's actually starting to affect the length and pacing of my
868080	872640	videos to a degree that I think is not good for the videos themselves, so I'm going to change it
872640	877680	over. Uh, this and one more time I'm going to do readings of the credits just so everyone who wants
877680	882400	to be in them has a chance to, and I can correct if I get the names wrong this time, and in future
882400	886080	I'm going to have different rewards for backers at that level. So I'm going to do streams of me
886080	889200	editing the videos and some other stuff like that. If there's other stuff you think I should
889200	893840	do for backers like that, please let me know. But in the meantime, it's thanks for allowing me to
893840	901280	afford to spend the time, effort, and money doing ridiculous stuff like this. I'd really like to thank

1270320	1273920	If I didn't get that name right or any others for that matter, please let me know and I'll issue a
1273920	1279040	correction in the last video where I do the credits. Thank you very much. Seriously, thank you all so
1279040	1286240	much. It's absolutely amazing. I'm still shocked. I mean, I set up the reward where I read names out
1286240	1292880	because I thought like six people would ever do it, and here I am with too many that I can't
1292880	1298080	really do readings of the credits anymore without adding like 10 minutes to a video. It's amazing.
