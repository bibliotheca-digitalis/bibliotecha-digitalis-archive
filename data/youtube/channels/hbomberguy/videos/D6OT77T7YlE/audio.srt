1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Citizen Kane is a film many scholars will tell you is the greatest of all time and some of them have even seen it

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,160
So they must mean business. It was genuinely quite revolutionary

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,400
It's credited with inventing or at least popularizing many cinematic techniques that are still used today, including the jump scare

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Everybody remembers that one scene where you suddenly cut to a cockatoo screeching just before it was to wake up the audience

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,720
It's the entire significance of the cockatoo and a lot of it really holds up

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,720
What's weird is you expect it to be a stuffy old thing vintage and prestigious and made for the amusement of old-timey people who?

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,240
Don't think like we do today, but it can get properly funny and energetic at times hot take just putting this out there

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,360
Citizen Kane

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,520
Pretty good movie. It was the feature film debut of writer director and wine salesman Orson Welles

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,800
Even while it was being made Kane was something of a rarity

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,600
Despite being made by a first-time director the production company he was under contract with RKO pictures the studio famously behind King Kong and

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,640
Citizen Kane had given Wells final cut privilege

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,720
This is a movie term referring to who gets final say over the film that actually gets sent to theaters

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,560
This is a level of artistic control not normally given to first-time directors

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,560
If a director doesn't have this privilege the executives and producers at the company often make their own changes for commercial

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,520
Personal or other reasons and can override the creators wishes for their work

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,040
Wells used Final Cut to make a film seen by many nerd betas as the greatest ever when Wells next film with the same studio

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,800
The Magnificent Ambersons had mixed test screenings Wells made small changes

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,160
But remained confident the work was good and would be received better on a full release

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,720
However RKO felt otherwise and due to various contract negotiations

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,240
Wells had given up Final Cut privileges while Wells was working on another film in Brazil

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:57,800
RKO made extensive edits to the film including reshooting the ending to be completely different and cut 40 minutes out in Wells own words

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,920
What's left is only the first six reels

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,160
My whole third act is lost because of all of the hysterical tinkering that went on and it was

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,920
Genuinely lost too to save space in the film archives the removed segments of the film were destroyed

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,560
the creators ideal version of The Magnificent Ambersons is gone forever the released version of Ambersons is regarded by all four people who've seen it as

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,280
One of the best films ever and perhaps even better than Citizen Kane, but that only makes the whole thing more horrible

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,720
We can only imagine what it could have been

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,240
This was the beginning of Wells long fight for creative control over his projects a fight

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,680
He seemed to lose most of the time Wells went on to make lots of other films during his career and some of them are

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,120
Still really good, but in many ways a lot of them were never truly his

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,560
Wells was open about things he wished he'd done differently or more ideal versions of his films

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,120
He even considered doing a new ending of Magnificent Ambersons 30 years later with the surviving actors

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,000
But these truer versions of his films never surfaced

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,120
Wells I argue was ahead of his time here what he was yearning to do was make

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,440
Directors cuts in the modern era the idea that a film will get a director's cut is almost taken for granted

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,440
In fact, it's so widely accepted that the director's cut is the most authentic version of a film that some fans of the DC superhero

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,680
movies are asking specifically for a Snyder cut of Justice League under the impression that this would

39
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Inherently be the better version of the film than the version that some other later

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Director would have made tens of thousands of dollars have been raised for charities in the process of fans

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,560
Demonstrating their desire to Warner Brothers now. I quite like a lot of Zack Snyder's films myself

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,880
The first step is admitting have a problem

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,100
And I'd love to see his version of Justice League and also unsee the version that Joss Whedon witty

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,160
Dialogue to himself all over

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,440
But I can't help but notice that we seem to now be living in an age

46
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,360
Where you can't just dislike a film and move on with your life

47
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,160
It's an opportunity to become even more engaged to give even more of your time to something you didn't even like in the hopes of

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,520
Getting a newer better version. So how did we get here and

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,720
Our directors cuts all that different that much of the time or isn't it somewhat bizarre to expect a director to relive a finished work?

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,040
In order to make a slightly better version of something that was already completed and released

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,000
And as a director really the main authority on the most ideal version of a work

52
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
Let's look at

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,160
let's look at some examples of directors cuts and how they're different from the originals and if they're actually that much better and

54
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,600
Just generally go on an adventure of discovery for what all this means for how we think about art in the modern era

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
That's that's pretty good. Doesn't it? Welcome back to scanline

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,560
Put succinctly a director's cut is a version of a motion picture that is edited according to the director's wishes and that usually

57
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,240
Includes scenes cut from the version created for general distribution

58
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,040
Wikipedia says Blade Runner was the first film to ever use the phrasing directors cut in marketing

59
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,780
But but the page doesn't actually cite a source to confirm this. So thanks Wikipedia

60
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,920
It's excellent excellent work there as the questions of creative control grow increasingly culturally pertinent and profitable

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,480
It's become more and more common for films to have a second release as a new

62
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,400
alternative version one more in line with the directors original wishes a sort of final cut privilege in retrospect a

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,760
Shocking amount of films have directors cuts now, which gives the impression they serve a creative need that goes unsatisfied in the original process

64
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,280
But creative control is more of a vague conceptual idea than a thing whose effects are truly measurable

65
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Let's look at some tangible examples of differences between cuts and why they can be important

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,520
We might as well start with Blade Runner since it apparently started all this cite your sources. God damn it

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,600
Ridley Scott's

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,960
1982 sci-fi dystopian speculative fiction science fiction film blade run everyone knows what Blade Runner is

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,720
Why am I explaining Blade Runner is a very good movie? I think I've heard it's good

70
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,520
I've got a copy here in my editing program and I'm skipping through it looking for footage to use and wow, it seems great

71
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,220
It's got flying cars and a cool gun explores complex questions about personhood and what it even means to be human

72
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,460
It's got music. It's good. There's

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,940
some eyes in it and

74
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,820
Some eyes here and here this guy loves talking about seeing things with his eyes and then later he tells this guy

75
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,660
But all the stuff he's seen

76
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,740
Whoa, if I didn't know any better, I'd say there's some kind of theme going on here foolish Ridley

77
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,700
Don't you know themes are for book reports get all these images and ideas out of here before you poke someone's eye

78
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,580
Yeah, oh no

79
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,780
I'm doing it the movie had mixed reception upon its release to quote Brian J

80
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,560
Rob's guide to Ridley Scott critical reaction was decidedly mixed the New York Times called it muddled yet

81
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,540
Mesmerizing Time magazine said the film like its setting is a beautiful

82
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:07,220
Deadly organism that devours life and the Los Angeles Times complained blade crawler might be more like it got him

83
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,620
Oh fuck him up Sheila the film while good had some confusing choices and strange problems

84
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,300
There's a lot of beautifully subtle

85
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,660
Storytelling and world-building where the viewer is given the chance to think for themselves and pick up on what's happening by paying attention

86
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,700
You know the score pal. You're not cop your little people and yet there's this terrible voiceover

87
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,340
And I'd rather be a killer than a victim and that's exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant the voiceover

88
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,860
Explains away everything even remotely subtle and it sounds like Harrison Ford is bored out of his mind

89
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,620
there's a lot of really beautiful storytelling like when Deckard retires a female replicant and

90
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,260
Looking at her body feels genuinely awful about what he's done

91
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,420
The audience can see plainly what hunting down creatures who are effectively human and have done nothing wrong except want to live longer

92
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,300
Has done to him

93
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,740
But then the voiceover comes in just to make sure you know that's happening

94
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,180
Just in case you don't like being trusted to think the report would be routine retirement of a replicant

95
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,300
Which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. Oh

96
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,820
Deckard feels sympathy. I wouldn't have known

97
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,980
It's not like there's an actor in the frame showing me or anything by far. The worst one is legendary

98
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,260
We get this incredible moment of humanity from Roy Batty

99
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,020
Theoretically the antagonist of the movie as his lifespan runs out and he talks about the beauty of all the things he's seen

100
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,420
It's one of the greatest moments in film history. But hey, guess what decides to ruin it?

101
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:42,060
I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments. He loved life more than he ever had before

102
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,580
Oh

103
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,340
I think that guy likes being alive

104
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,020
Deckard and Rachel prepare to escape together and in a very tense moment

105
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,740
Deckard finds proof gaff has been in his apartment a calling card of his is left in there

106
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,900
then they leave and it's incredibly tense and suspenseful as the doors close and

107
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,740
Then suddenly after all this noirish tension and dystopian storytelling and eternal night and rain and neon BAM

108
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,580
upbeat music bright skies clean air

109
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,500
Deckard and Rachel are taking a nice drive in the woods and that crappy voiceover tells us actually Rachel was a special replicant who doesn't have

110
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,060
a built-in death date

111
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,700
Tyrella told me Rachel was special no termination date. Oh

112
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,420
Sure. Yeah, this ending doesn't feel weird at all in the last 30 seconds of the film

113
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,100
It all turned out to be okay, just a complete whiplash and why is that unicorn there?

114
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,260
So it was fine really good even but clearly flawed soon after its release

115
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,220
There was speculation that the studio had meddled with production

116
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,660
I mean that ending is literally just b-roll borrowed from The Shining a so-called work print of the film not entirely finished version made during

117
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:52,820
The editing process had been shown to test audiences and was speculated to have been significantly different and then edited down and in the early

118
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,660
90s, it started being shown in a limited theatrical run branded as a director's cut though

119
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:04,420
Scott had no actual say in this version's release either and publicly disowned this version the work print wasn't a finished version of the film

120
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,940
For example, it was missing the horrendous voiceover, which is obviously a positive thing to miss

121
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,320
There are no closing credits and it just ends on the words the end

122
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,060
But more importantly it doesn't the end with a horrible story ruining tacked on happy ending

123
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,800
It ends in the elevator with Deckard and Rachel with all the horrible feelings of uncertainty and doom that come with not knowing what happens

124
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Next and that Rachel probably doesn't have long to live even if Gaff spared her the unicorn thing is still weird, though

125
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,680
I guess Gaff is just a quirky guy who likes to spare people and do origami to be fair

126
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm a pretty big fan of sparing people

127
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,280
I even showed Kurt mercy even though he showed me no gratitude for it

128
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,120
The work print was surprisingly popular and the differences were lauded as positive ones

129
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,880
This caused Warner Brothers to begin work on a proper director's cut

130
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:56,040
Well, not actually a director's cut someone else was put in charge of doing it and Scott just got to provide notes and consult on it

131
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,160
Warner Brothers seemed to be banking on the idea of releasing a director's cut and all the ideas of creative freedom that

132
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,800
Implied to fans and film buffs but not in actually giving the actual director that actual freedom

133
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,020
The director's cut is so much better than the original when trying to explain what the differences actually are

134
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,100
There aren't exactly that many major changes if you just list them out largely it's about what's not there anymore

135
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,260
There's no voiceovers whatsoever and the happy ending has been removed

136
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,140
It's amazing what bigger difference the lack of voiceover has though

137
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,220
It lets all the actors and performances breathe instead of being told what to think about something

138
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,780
They're simply being shown it and expected to think for themselves and that's really powerful

139
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
Hey Shannon

140
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,320
Yeah, okay when you're editing this bit

141
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,460
I want it to slowly digitally zoom on my face

142
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,140
While I get emotional about how good Blade Runner is and you know

143
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,820
We can play like some knockoff tears in rain music. We can get Zoe blade to do it. It'll be great

144
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,700
It'll be really funny reference Harris. I don't I don't think that works in a video essay

145
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,220
Yeah, but I want it and I'm the director. Yeah. Well, I'm doing a lot of the editing and I might not edit it like that

146
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,260
Maybe in the final cut of this video 20 years later, you can finally achieve your dumb vision. Oh, I get it

147
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
That's very meta

148
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,580
And I mean honestly he's like speaking as your co-writer the parts of the video that you wrote are full of holes in your research

149
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,700
Like the cockatoo scene in Citizen Kane isn't the first jump scare

150
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,380
It was most likely popularized by cat people in 1942 with the lootin bus. There's a scene with a bus

151
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,820
It's the first ever like well-known jump scare

152
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,660
Yeah, but it's a funny joke in it and we get to explain the cockatoo and that's pretty good

153
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,540
It's a it's a very light-hearted opening. It doesn't have to be completely true. Oh

154
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,820
Now I'm explaining my joke. I spent ages convincing myself. That bit was funny now. It's ruined

155
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,860
By the way, what happened to the footage of me driving to McDonald's for 15 minutes and talking about how much I love tapes for

156
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,860
The last video. Did you just take it out?

157
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,860
Am I gonna have to start a petition to release the Harris cut of the VHS episode of Scanline

158
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,860
Is that really gonna have to happen now? You know what?

159
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,700
Forget it. I'm cutting this whole part out. It interrupts your explanation of the director's cut and honestly, it's a little bit indulgent

160
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,460
What no, you can't do that. My overly indulgent directors intent is being violated. You can't just

161
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,660
But most importantly and I can't stress enough how cool a change this is

162
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,980
Midway through the movie while Deckard plays idly on his piano. He begins to have a dream and he dreams

163
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,540
about a unicorn

164
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,180
Holy shit. I mean, holy shit. What a small simple change and yet the difference is amazing

165
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,700
I mean firstly finally someone in the movie based on the book do androids dream of electric sheep has someone having a dream in it

166
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:54,340
But more importantly now the origami unicorn gaff leaves behind means something because how could gaff know Deckard's dreams?

167
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:02,140
This implies that maybe Deckard is also a replicant who believes he's human with implanted dreams and memories. It's still ambiguous

168
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:09,460
Obviously, I mean maybe gaff also dreams about unicorns humans do don't they this ambiguity to me

169
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,180
At least is the point of the film ultimately

170
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,060
It doesn't matter whether Deckard is a replicant because he would still be equally a person

171
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:24,300
human in all but name and it's only in this cut many years after its release that this point really gets to be made and

172
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,700
All this stuff is brought up by the simple inclusion of a daydream about a unicorn

173
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,140
It's kind of amazing how much a simple change just a couple of seconds of new footage

174
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,500
Can impact the overall meaning and value of an entire film?

175
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,980
I think this better than anything else in any other film can demonstrate the sheer power

176
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,940
Editing can have on a movie quoting here from Rob's book again ten years later in

177
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,420
1992 with the release of the director's cut the film received the welcome it deserved according to the Washington Post

178
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,140
The film is great on every level the poignant screenplay about a man's futile quest for immortality

179
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,940
Scott's tremendous direction the incredible futuristic sets designed by Lawrence G

180
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,380
Paul Sid Mead and the others the phenomenal special effects and the touching performances

181
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,180
Especially from Hauer a replicant fighting against the ebbing of his life

182
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,220
His swan song is one of the most touching in modern movie history quick aside

183
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,940
Maybe people would have been more willing to recognize his performance if there hadn't been a fucking voiceover right after it

184
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,340
What's interesting about this director's cut though is that it wasn't actually the director's cut

185
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:33,260
it's ironic that one of the most famous examples of a director's cut is not actually a director's cut and

186
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,580
Studios were already capitalizing on the idea of a director's cut to sell a movie, but we'll get back to that later

187
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,420
15 years later. There was a final cut of Blade Runner, which was made with Scott finally in complete control

188
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,340
It's essentially a version of the director's cut with slightly different editing better effects some changes in color grading

189
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,980
Harrison Ford's son came in to reshoot a few minor things to make mouth movements that fit the ADR

190
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,820
Oh and most importantly the shot of the bird flying away at the end finally matches the rest of the fucking scene

191
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,340
It took 25 years, but we did it everyone

192
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,700
It's not really a necessary version of the film

193
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,260
But it's nice that Scott finally got to make a version he properly had control over

194
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,180
After the success of the director's cut of Blade Runner

195
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Director's cuts became increasingly common the most famous other example of this is also by Ridley Scott

196
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,740
Kingdom of Heaven's original release was very divisive and pretty poorly received overall

197
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,700
Critics and audiences generally found it unsatisfying often boring and lacking in depth

198
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,900
It was so bad that Roger Ebert a film critic from opposite land who says the wrong thing almost all the time because he's a hack

199
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,620
Gave it three and a half stars out of four and said it was better than gladiator

200
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,660
Three and a half stars. I'm not saying Roger Ebert's taste is questionable, but just putting it out there

201
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
That's the rating he gave to The Phantom Menace

202
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,820
Okay, actually I take it back Roger Ebert's great people are really uncharitable to The Phantom Menace

203
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:58,100
It's actually pretty good Kingdom of Heaven then got a director's cut released on DVD with 45 minutes of new material

204
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Which massively expands the story alters the roles of the main characters and turns the film into a genuine masterpiece of historical epicness?

205
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,220
And fleshes out Orlando Bloom's role so much that it transforms into his best ever

206
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:18,220
Performance and also frankly his only performance there are hundreds of directors cuts now many of which arguably improved the movie

207
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,260
Most of them have much less drastic changes than these

208
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,620
But it's clear that even small changes can make a big difference and as with the final cut even if there's next to no difference

209
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:34,620
The point is the creator getting to achieve their vision unsullied by previous meddling. That is the point right isn't it?

210
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,620
Well, not all alternative cuts of films exist for this reason artistic intent and creative ambition

211
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,740
Aren't set in stone

212
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,380
Okay time to get personal as a creator who's got a lot of stuff out there that he can't

213
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,900
Meaningfully go back and change without releasing it as a whole new thing

214
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,660
There are tons of things that I would do differently now in retrospect or

215
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,260
Mistakes that I genuinely would love to go back and fix when I make YouTube videos for my own personal channel

216
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,420
I inherently have final cut privilege. No one can tell me what to do

217
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,420
There is no executive producer with any oversight or control and when I work with a sponsor

218
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,580
I tell them I'm not gonna make any changes even if they ask and they just are gonna have to live with what I make

219
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,100
so

220
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,500
Basically, I am at all times free to unleash my unmitigated

221
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,860
Creative vision upon the world, but what if my unmitigated creative vision isn't perfect the first time around?

222
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,860
what if I make genuine mistakes or change my mind or

223
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,260
Couldn't afford to do something or just didn't have the talent to creative the things I

224
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,980
visioned

225
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,740
That's got to be pretty

226
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,380
Unmitigating right there. Most of the time directors cuts for me would be things like

227
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,420
Rerecording voiceover to sound a bit less echoey or a bit less mouth clicky that sound

228
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,460
I hate when I hear myself making that sound it's awful or remove jokes that I realized weren't actually very funny in retrospect or

229
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,420
Worse are actually casually ableist and I just hadn't noticed or fix that time

230
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,580
I accidentally left an arrow at 2% opacity at the top of the screen by accident

231
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,100
So fully fading it out and it's there for half the fucking video

232
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,020
So getting another run at the project isn't always fully about control

233
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,020
It's about making improvements that you feel you could do now and a lot of directors cuts are more in line with this way of thinking

234
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,740
One director is famous for changing his mind about something after releasing a film that he thought was fine at the time and that

235
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:35,820
Director's name is Paul Thomas Anderson when Magnolia came out it was well-received but considered by some to be a little on the long side

236
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,060
Anderson defended the decisions he made for his film and seemed pretty happy with it

237
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:46,420
And I was really upfront, you know saying it's gonna be three hours and you know, they were wonderful in saying, okay

238
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,460
We're not gonna tell you what to do. We'd love it if this was shorter, you know

239
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,700
But but so just make it as short as you can

240
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,940
But the interesting thing about time is it makes you rethink your work a little sometimes this movie at this moment

241
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,380
The one that is in the theaters today. Yeah, it's the movie you wanted to make exactly

242
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,460
Is it the movie you set out to me exactly?

243
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,860
But if you were given the opportunity to do another cut of it, oh, I'd slice that thing down

244
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,780
It's way too fucking long good. Oh, no, it's it's it's unmerciful how long it is

245
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,980
No director's cut of Magnolia has been released

246
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,860
But it's useful knowing directors might have made their own films differently with the benefit of hindsight

247
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,060
Even when they defended them at the time Sam Raimi had complete control over Evil Dead his first film to the point

248
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,220
He places the failure of his next film Crime Wave on there being too much oversight compared to Evil Dead

249
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,980
They replaced my actors. They threw Bruce Campbell out of the lead. They threw out my musician Joe LaDuca

250
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,260
They recut the picture. They had their own say with the sound effects and mix they

251
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,900
Did everything they could to make it what it is today. Do you see Crime Wave?

252
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,940
I

253
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,860
Saw that movie on an airplane and people still walked out

254
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:11,300
Edie was independently financed largely by whoever Raimi and his friends could get to give them money so they could do whatever they wanted

255
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,100
We didn't have nearly the freedom as our first film because investors aren't gonna come on the set

256
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,340
Dennis isn't gonna say are you sure that camera angles, right?

257
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,820
But this freedom doesn't mean Raimi was necessarily going to be happy forever with all aspects of the film he made

258
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,580
There's a controversial segment in the film where a woman is sexually assaulted by demonic trees

259
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,660
the scene is far more gruesome than anything else in the film and it's definitely a

260
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,280
Contributing factor to it being regarded as one of the video nasties in the UK and getting an NC-17 in the US

261
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,660
Plus it was banned in other countries with different releases subject to various different cuts over the years in

262
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,740
Retrospect Raimi isn't happy with that scene and talks about this openly

263
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,340
well, I think it was unnecessarily gratuitous and a little too brutal and I finally because

264
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,780
People were offended in a way that I did. My goal is not to offend people. It is to entertain thrill scare

265
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,300
Make them laugh but not to offend them

266
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,500
Regret putting it in I do I do

267
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,700
Piers Haggard felt precisely the same way about his folk horror film the blood on Satan's claw the rape scene now

268
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,780
I think it's probably too strong and it's interesting that I wasn't bothered at the time. I think you

269
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Will find most directors

270
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,460
If they get their teeth into a sequence, which is going to be really powerful

271
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,060
They become completely seduced and I was seduced by the sheer dramatic power

272
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,660
Directors have these kinds of regrets or change their minds about stuff all the time

273
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,860
Although of course no studio has helped them re-release these films with the sexual assaults cut

274
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,820
I guess adding in more unicorns is more important than ameliorating excessive sexual violence on film

275
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,060
Some directors actually do get to make their ideal changes though

276
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,140
The Coen brothers who did some work on the editing of Evil Dead and later worked closely with Raimi on other projects

277
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,980
Got to do a director's cut of blood simple despite also being in charge of the original cut blood simple is awesome

278
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,220
It's very different from the rest of their films, but not tangibly worse just different

279
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,740
It's a very stripped down thriller. The director's cut is even more streamlined. It's about three minutes shorter

280
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,020
No scenes have been outright cut but a lot of shots have been trimmed down in length

281
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,580
So the feel is much tighter. These changes are very small

282
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,020
The director's cut is arguably tighter and better edited

283
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,020
But also not different enough that I don't think anyone who didn't like it would like it that much more

284
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,060
And I don't think anyone who really likes the movie thinks that much better of it because of this version either

285
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,940
I'm reminded here of Orson Welles complaining about hysterical tinkering

286
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,540
What exactly was the purpose of all this? The film is theoretically better

287
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:50,300
But I find it strange that people would go back to create a slightly better version of something that already existed and was fine

288
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,140
Now I love the Coen brothers as much as the next pretentious white nerd boy

289
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,260
But frankly if there's any evidence that director's cuts are actually a bad idea

290
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:06,700
This is exhibit a aren't mistakes something we ought to accept rather than hope to eventually see slightly touched up later in one

291
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,660
Of the many documentaries about Blade Runner one called all our variant futures

292
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,660
A lot of attention is paid to all the mistakes being fixed in the final cut

293
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,940
But a lot is also made of the charm of some of the mistakes

294
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:24,100
Gaff's eye color changing things like that and it's clear a lot of thought went into when one mistake is something to be

295
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,500
Corrected to improve the quality of the work and when other mistakes bring their own

296
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:34,060
Character to the film and ought to be left alone aren't all these mistakes part of the film though

297
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,420
Should an artist be allowed to

298
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,260
Perpetually alter their work once it's been handed over to the public in a 1993 article in the journal film comment

299
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:50,900
Film scholar and critic Greg Solomon wrote uncertain glory directors cut editions the redemption of an art or the first step on a slippery slope

300
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,500
He said viewing film art as perpetually subject to update and correction

301
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,220
Political or other says something about the directors relationship to their work in a way

302
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:09,340
They redress artistic grievances by treating movies as mere product in this country and an alienable right to change as an

303
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,700
artist doesn't extend to changing art and

304
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:20,540
therefore art history rather than artistic deliverance the DC trend represents a significant disturbance of film history and

305
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,300
Equally important the popular cultural memory of the original audiences even kitsch merits protection

306
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,380
The directors cut means the practical elimination of a film record and that the market

307
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,660
Valorizes the new to the point that it supplants the old version and despite what the misnomer directors cut implies

308
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,380
This movement augurs poorly for the rise of the Hollywood auteur

309
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,740
There's certainly no amelioration of the compromise between strict studio and enterprising director

310
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:55,500
Essential to evaluating their personal commitment to circumvention of studio Philistines in the end the same old commerce here

311
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,220
Masquerades as the aesthetics of creative freedom the ending to his piece is appropriately dramatic

312
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:08,060
Our film culture faces a future in which old movies will not just seem different from how we remembered them

313
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,700
They will be the theatrical release is fast becoming a work in progress

314
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,480
Original versions soon will exist only in the fragments of our collective memory

315
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,640
Then to quote the authority all those moments will be lost in time

316
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
like tears in

317
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:32,740
Rain in a much more recent piece Alex roses or tears gone wild why the directors cut often turns into an axe murder in the American

318
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,960
Scholar from 2010 Rose says directors couldn't leave well enough alone

319
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,940
They redressed their early classics in ever gaudier clothing and attempts to reclaim their youthful eminence since corrupted by years of compromise

320
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,020
Rose calls directors cuts an indulgence saying even the subtleties while peripheral and seemingly innocuous

321
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,820
Have their effects an extra cutaway here a quick reaction shot there and suddenly the gags aren't quite as funny

322
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,420
The sex scenes aren't as breathless the fights lose their drive the dialogue drags

323
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,700
Just a little more padding and primping and the intangible gestalt of the original is lost

324
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,380
Indulgence is a death sentence a reliable antidote. However is the adoption of

325
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,620
Constraints and what other medium would colossal vanity be permitted much less encouraged

326
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:27,660
Solman says typically the commercially successful rather than the artistically worthy enjoys studio benevolence

327
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,860
Same as it ever was in a reader's response section in a film comment from later in the year

328
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,460
Gordon Hale from Philadelphia has a prescient comment on Solman's piece

329
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,820
He describes Tom Richardson re-editing Tom Jones then says as films grow older and their copyrights expire

330
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:49,140
Both the artists and the moneymen will have the same incentive to prepare new editions

331
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,540
Qualifying for new copyrights original versions will then be withdrawn completely new improved

332
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:02,740
Editions will abound just like toothpaste and detergent and the example Solomon cites will seem like a drop in the bucket

333
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,740
So even though I like blood simple, I really quite like that. There is a director's cut of blood simple

334
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,740
I love the Coen brothers and I'm glad that they have the power to go back and do that if they want

335
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,740
It still manages to pose a lot of difficult questions about how much power a director should have over their art and

336
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:26,460
Whether or not directors cuts are actually as anti-commercial as they seem to be. Maybe there's a certain confidence or

337
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,740
Honesty in not going back and making changes

338
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,900
Anderson and Ramey have criticisms of their old films as anyone who gets years to look back on their work ought to do

339
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,860
But they aren't going back and making changes to things that are already a part of history in order to satisfy those criticisms

340
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,100
It's okay to learn and move on for things to not be perfect

341
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,940
it may well be that the ability to go back and change something if you want to

342
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,020
Poses just as much of a threat to the integrity of art as any meddling studio

343
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,740
Sometimes the directors changes don't just not make the film any better

344
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,620
But they actively make it worse and what director's name springs to mind better than Francis Ford Coppola

345
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,060
Apocalypse now is a really good film and it better be because it took forever to make and would have destroyed Coppola's

346
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,540
Coppola's

347
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,660
Coppola's career if it hadn't but it was good. So it meant Coppola kept his career and was free to go on to make

348
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,500
Apocalypse now is a really good film but in a very interesting way at nearly two and a half hours

349
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,380
It's pretty long

350
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:33,460
But the pacing of the movie is so good all the scenes flow so perfectly and the dreamlike

351
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,940
Descent into madness is so well-defined that it's pleasant to sit through you kind of slip into it

352
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,140
It doesn't feel its length at all. If you showed me the movie and told me it was 90 minutes

353
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,860
I would probably believe you in 2001 Coppola released apocalypse now Redux

354
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:57,980
Redux Redux Redux an extended cut with reworked editing and more scenes added in this new version is three hours and 22 minutes

355
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,260
More content squeezed out of the content tube onto the conveyor belt of cinema. Yes, please

356
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,540
apocalypse now good film great film arguably a

357
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,700
masterpiece

358
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
apocalypse now Redux

359
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:19,060
Garbage the whole thing is fucking terrible. He ruined it. I hate you so much Francis

360
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,220
When you shoot over a million feet of footage to make your masterpiece

361
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,060
Which yeah, I guess is an achievement

362
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:35,260
It turns out that most of that footage is piss and you probably shouldn't put all of it in the film

363
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,700
The additional scenes utterly destroy the pacing of the original so while it's technically only

364
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,060
Almost an hour longer. It feels five hours longer

365
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,540
I've seen the Redux version twice and both times

366
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,780
I had to pause and do something else for a while like take a nap or watch a different better film

367
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,220
The long-ass plantation scene adds so little to the film

368
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,820
It effectively takes away from it by distracting from what the film had successfully focused on more by being shorter

369
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,420
Just because some of the stuff in a film is good doesn't mean you can put an entire kitchen. Oh fuck

370
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:15,380
All the tiny scenes of humor or light-hearted escapes from the darkness are washed away by the sheer scope of the thing

371
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,620
It just keeps on going and it's boring and drags to the point of being actively painful

372
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,500
Ha I slapped my meat too hard against the walls of my set

373
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,140
They're all hurting now

374
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,540
Luckily since it turns out that directors intent is a super malleable concept

375
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:37,140
It appears that Coppola has changed his mind yet again about what his film is supposed to be this year for the 40th anniversary

376
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,180
He's releasing the apocalypse now final cut

377
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,980
Directors cut number three at this point, which is actually 20 minutes shorter than the Redux version

378
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,260
I'm curious if this version of the film manages to maintain the amazing feel of the original but honestly, I doubt it

379
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:59,060
Coppola already made a really good version of his film 40 years ago. He had his final cut take it away from him now

380
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,980
He's done. It was fine. I haven't seen this version of the film because I don't

381
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,300
Care, but it is coming to a theater right next to me in September

382
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,420
So I basically have no choice to eventually see it and in the director's cut of this video. I will

383
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,820
Put my impressions of the film here and let you know what I thought of it

384
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,500
And that video will come out in 20 years

385
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,740
Or when I hit a million subscribers

386
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Whichever comes first

387
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,980
Incidentally years ago when I was talking to one of my many

388
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,540
Pretentious film friends who I secretly hate I studied documentary production at uni you run into these people

389
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,380
It's an occupational hazard and I was explaining to her how much I hated apocalypse now Redux

390
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,740
But then she asked me have you heard about the work print?

391
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,220
She then went on to explain that there is a leaked work print of the movie, which is five hours

392
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,260
Long the ten minute long song the end by the doors

393
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,540
Plays in its entirety in the opening in this version of the film

394
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,860
What were they thinking was the intent to make a film that long at some point?

395
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,020
Did they think people would watch it were they developing an experimental new torture device?

396
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,700
Don't watch it even if you can find it leaked online somewhere. Just don't watch it

397
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:21,860
It's not worth stealing this draft of apocalypse now much like the actual draft is something that you're morally obliged to dodge

398
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,820
So here's an even more evolved version of the blood simple problem directors are going back and re-re-editing

399
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,740
Their films to try to undo some of the damage they did in the first re-edit

400
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,380
The slippery slope was real and one of the best directors ever is actively tumbling down it right now

401
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,500
Hysterically tinkering with his film again

402
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,820
But there's actually an even more egregious example of a director making a silly edit to their film and everyone wanting the original back

403
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,580
That's right. You all knew it was coming. I'm talking about Steven Spielberg

404
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,620
ET the extraterrestrial is a pretty good movie, but 20 years later Spielberg decided some changes were necessary

405
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:06,740
The kids in this scene are in way too much danger look some of those cops have guns well now in this version

406
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,100
They have walkie-talkies

407
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,980
Phew now the kids are never in any danger as they fly hundreds of feet in the air on fucking bicycles

408
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:20,140
It appears that even Steven has gone on to regret this decision or at the very least makes sure the original is still available

409
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,460
So this is an example of a director deciding they want something changed going to great

410
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,540
Technological lengths to get it changed and then having second thoughts

411
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,140
This whole directorial freedom to go back and change your films as important thing is

412
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,900
Starting to look a little bit flimsy in the face of directors making changes that they then decide were bad

413
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,340
There's probably an example of a director being even worse than this, but whoa whoops. Oh look

414
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,180
We're out of time for this episode of scan

415
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,900
fine

416
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
We all want to talk about him

417
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:01,540
It's time to talk about Federico Fellini fine George Lucas George Lucas is amazing and revolutionary science fiction film

418
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:09,620
THX 1138 is an ass-kickingly depressing and bizarre prediction of the future that makes some really incisive comments about modern consumerism

419
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:17,180
Characters literally buy weird plastic shapes just for the joy of having purchased something then throw them in the trash in

420
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:24,340
1977 George Lucas predicted Funko pop the original theatrical version had five minutes taken out against Lucas's wishes

421
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,900
After the success of a couple of above-average fantasy films

422
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,740
He made a bit later Lucas got to release a restored version with that footage added back in which is nice

423
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,900
He got his movie back in line with his vision

424
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,540
But then George started deciding that his films couldn't just be brought into accordance with his original vision

425
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,980
No, they could be retrospectively

426
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,940
improved

427
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,980
I'm sure you all know about this already, but in 2004 George Lucas released the director's cut of

428
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,900
THX 1138 I'm doing another fake out this director's cut adds a bunch of CGI and some new shots and effects

429
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,180
It's two minutes longer, and it's just kind of needless

430
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,260
It's nice that his film got to be properly mastered and restored I guess

431
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,980
But the level of meddling with a thing that was really finished decades prior is unnecessary

432
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,500
The film doesn't need some more CGI scenes added in years later

433
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,900
It was already great if an old thing has flaws or isn't perfect or you change your mind about it

434
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,540
Sometimes it's okay to let it go. Well that about wraps it up for this episode of

435
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,900
GEORGE

436
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,700
George

437
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Mr.. Lucas, I

438
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,220
Love your films. I love you as a person. I love you as a thinker

439
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,300
I think you're an amazing man and Star Wars is an absolute blessing

440
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,300
I love all of them even the prequels have some great stuff in there my contract with Shannon obliges me not to defend the

441
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,260
Prequels too hard in a video attached to her name, but you know how I feel

442
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,980
You've read my emails, but come on

443
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,620
What were you doing?

444
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:03,260
did we really need hand to be marginally less of a scoundrel by making him shoot second and

445
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,420
Then did we really need him to shoot second while also awkwardly CGI dodging a close-range laser blast

446
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,980
Did we really need R2 to be hidden slightly more behind the rocks?

447
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,420
Making it a little more believable that he couldn't be seen but making us wonder how we even got in there

448
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:25,260
Did we really need to remove a cool scene from Return of the Jedi just to show off the amazing new CGI?

449
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,700
You could do now did we need this this part looks better on VHS by the way

450
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,700
I wonder if someone has done a video about why that would be but come on, bro

451
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,340
Even you think the hand stuff is silly now George

452
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,420
I loved your work genuinely and completely

453
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,300
But it's on you that it's such a hassle to see the original unedited versions people saw and loved in the theater

454
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,220
And that's just not fair even if those versions don't line up with your vision

455
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,020
Spielberg did the right thing making sure the versions people loved are still available

456
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,460
Because movies don't just belong to directors to their supposed auteurs. They also belong to culture

457
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,700
You can have your version of the movie, but the people ought to have theirs

458
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I genuinely find you and your work hugely inspirational

459
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:13,260
But the way access to the originals was deliberately obscured by you was really disappointing

460
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:21,660
All these different kinds of directors cut with differing resulting effects, well, they really complicate all this don't they?

461
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,420
So yeah studios mess with films often irrevocably

462
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,660
It's nice that sometimes an unmessed version can manifest but the problem is

463
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,820
Artists and audiences have been enamored with the concept of this

464
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,780
Directors run the risk of falling down a rabbit hole

465
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,020
Continuously re-editing their work once it's already out like it's in early access or something

466
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:52,700
Changing their minds about what their own visions even were and sometimes even helping to obscure the versions people know and love from history

467
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,300
Worse than this what makes a director an authority on what the film should be?

468
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Directors are a small part of a project the producers writers editors actors

469
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,020
Artists set designers all these people are so important and valuable on any project

470
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,260
That it seems almost rude to pretend the director is the one who should decide what the film they all made is

471
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,220
It takes a village to raise a child and the mayor of the village shouldn't get to say that child belongs to them

472
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,580
This problem hits me on a personal level

473
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,300
In fact, the last scanline video did surprisingly well and made it into some lists of best video essays

474
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:34,620
But often it was credited directly to me when scanline is a collaborative show between me and Shannon Strucci

475
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:41,900
Whose name was above mine in the credits we share writing editing and other creative duties. She's editing this part right now

476
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:48,340
I'm just doing the voiceover. It's really nice that we got recognized for our work, but it's our work not mine

477
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:55,340
I'm not trying to call anyone out here, but being credited for work. That wasn't simply mine makes me a little uncomfortable

478
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,380
It's an easy mistake to make the video is posted on my channel where most of the videos are purely my work

479
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,980
But I think this misunderstanding is also an extension of how we relate to art right now as products of central

480
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,700
Individuals and not the many other people who work on something or the surrounding situation that led to it on that note

481
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,140
I think what people like is the idea constructed by the concept of directors cuts

482
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:28,100
We like to imagine films as a struggle between true creators and the false moneymen as a battle to realize

483
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,100
Someone's vision. It's a compelling narrative and maybe it's a little true

484
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:40,420
The idea that there's an authentic version of a film is kind of beautiful and that makes the struggle to try and get that version

485
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,220
Seem almost romantic

486
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:49,360
But this narrative has been repackaged and sold back to us in the form of special editions of Terminator 2 with a couple more

487
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,600
Scenes and box sets of every version of Blade Runner for us to compare and contrast

488
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,360
Think about that Warner Brothers are responsible for the theatrical cut and here they are

489
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,760
Selling us the fixed version of a film that was broken by them

490
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,040
We like to think of works as made by one person

491
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,400
products of their own vision

492
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,600
When nothing is that simple the tears in rain monologue the best part of Blade Runner by far

493
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,560
Wasn't made by Ridley Scott

494
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,120
It wasn't even written by the writer not completely

495
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,200
Rutger Hauer modified the monologue the night before making it shorter and feel more human and added the most famous line

496
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,920
And then you know I came up with the line all those moments will be lost in time like tears and rain

497
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,680
Knowing this the idea that it's all up to some sole creator and their mystical intent

498
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,280
Only obscures the reality of filmmaking and trains us to desire a purity of vision

499
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,000
That's completely unattainable

500
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Makes us go out and buy more products for the joy of obtaining an even more perfected version of one person's idea

501
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,280
even if that idea was bad and keeps changing even

502
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,800
necessitating more versions and then

503
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,160
Unbroken versions so that you still have the original and it just goes on and on forever

504
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,640
When does the consumption end and the art begin there are no easy answers to questions about art the best

505
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,320
I can muster right now is

506
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,520
Directors cuts are certainly a valid idea and they can arguably improve the quality of a film

507
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,720
But this idea is also easily co-opted into the exact same commercialism that necessitated them in the first place

508
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,080
The idea that the director is the one person who should have final say on the most ideal version of a work is a highly

509
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,880
Ideological assumption which says more about how we think about film than it actually says about the medium itself

510
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,880
But that's a whole can of worms that we'll have to get into at a later date

511
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,240
I guess at some point we should maybe explore what

512
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,680
Authorship actually is and whether the author is alive or not and what the hell or term means

513
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,000
Join us on the next scanline when we discuss how meaning is constructed. Oh

514
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,640
Great. I'm gonna have to read books

515
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:05,120
But if anything what all this examination of cuts seems to relate is the power of editing

516
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:11,320
we've seen just how much very small changes can affect the feel of a whole sequence or the meaning of a story an

517
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,800
Editor can make a bad film great and a really good film

518
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,480
terrible and boring

519
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Editing is such an important part of the process

520
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,720
That some people spend years of their lives or an awful lot of money learning how to do it too much money

521
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,760
Frankly, luckily we here at scanline have put together a functioning simulation of a film school

522
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Hi Shannon here this cut here where the sound starts first is a great technique for drawing people into your film to do it

523
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,400
You just you you you just have the audio start first. See it's under the video on the timeline

524
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,360
So it looks like a J. It's called a J cut J. That's how you do a J cut. Okay. Thank you

525
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,160
That's film school. That'll be

526
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,600
If only there was a cheaper way to get someone to share the skills required to learn editing

527
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,760
Well, wait, hang on Skillshare is an online learning platform for creators

528
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,280
If you want to learn how to be an editor

529
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,560
Don't do what I did and try to teach yourself for ten years fellow youtuber Jordi van der putt has a class on editing in

530
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,760
Adobe Premiere that takes three hours and 22 minutes the exact length of apocalypse now Redux and a much better use of your time

531
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,720
Jordi's cutting animating and color correcting tips are like the decade

532
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,120
I spent teaching it to myself only in fast-forward and actually taught me a couple new things

533
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,920
I hadn't realized you could do so easily

534
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,760
I'm a little embarrassed about that and better yet

535
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,800
It didn't cost an entire college tuition an annual subscription to the entire platform is less than $10 a month

536
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,040
But if you click on the link in the description or go to skl.sh

537
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,340
Slash hbomberguy you can get two months of free access to these classes and over

538
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:50,520
25,000 more I talked about time management skills in a video a couple months ago and on that note Thomas Frank's productivity master class

539
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,660
Genuinely improved my life in measurable ways. Hold on. Do you hear this?

540
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,700
That's my filing cabinet, which I have now

541
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:05,580
I used to keep all the invoices for music and art and stuff in a big pile in the corner and leave to-do lists

542
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
everywhere and now I have a system that actually

543
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,260
Works and getting things done is much less daunting if stuff like that might be of interest to you

544
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
once again, that link is

545
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,780
skl.sh

546
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,220
Slash hbomberguy

547
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
So yeah director's cuts can be good

548
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,660
Often they aren't Francis

549
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,820
But on the whole it's clear why this is an aspect of film worth focusing on

550
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,900
Because as we've seen films really can be greatly altered by even tiny

551
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:39,500
Removals or additions cinema is often as much in here as it is on the screen. But what we see on the screen with our

552
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,420
eyes

553
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:47,420
Facilitates our emotions and beliefs and imaginations our collective reverence for alternative cuts

554
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:54,540
Reveals our understanding of the power films hold over us by learning just how differently the same idea can be expressed

555
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,020
We're learning more about how to express ourselves

556
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,180
Cinema is a powerful thing

557
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:07,720
Because it is an extension of the human soul. I've seen things that you people would believe because you've seen them, too

558
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,860
I've seen the addition of a daydream

559
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:19,020
Change how I feel about personhood and my entire understanding of a story. I've seen the addition of more things to something I like

560
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,420
Transform it into something I hate and I've seen thousands of people

561
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:29,580
Criticize a few scant frames of digital puppeteering because the original meant so much to them

562
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:36,700
And I'm glad that none of these moments will ever truly be lost because we have the power to share them with each other

563
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:44,700
Thank you for watching and that's when I realized that this guy might like

564
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,460
movies

565
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
I

566
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,700
I

567
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
I

568
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
I

569
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,420
Know this video is dedicated to the memory of Rutger Hauer who passed away this year

570
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:51,060
Incidentally 2019 is also the year in which Blade Runner was set. I find myself wondering

571
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,100
Which 2019 I'd rather live in

572
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,260
But frankly in both there are plenty of people who aren't being treated with the personhood they deserve

573
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,940
Go do something nice for someone today
