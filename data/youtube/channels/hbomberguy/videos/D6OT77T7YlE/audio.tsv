0	5280	Citizen Kane is a film many scholars will tell you is the greatest of all time and some of them have even seen it
5280	8160	So they must mean business. It was genuinely quite revolutionary
8160	14400	It's credited with inventing or at least popularizing many cinematic techniques that are still used today, including the jump scare
15880	21760	Everybody remembers that one scene where you suddenly cut to a cockatoo screeching just before it was to wake up the audience
23440	27720	It's the entire significance of the cockatoo and a lot of it really holds up
27880	34720	What's weird is you expect it to be a stuffy old thing vintage and prestigious and made for the amusement of old-timey people who?
34720	41240	Don't think like we do today, but it can get properly funny and energetic at times hot take just putting this out there
41840	43360	Citizen Kane
43360	48520	Pretty good movie. It was the feature film debut of writer director and wine salesman Orson Welles
48720	51800	Even while it was being made Kane was something of a rarity
52280	59600	Despite being made by a first-time director the production company he was under contract with RKO pictures the studio famously behind King Kong and
60720	63640	Citizen Kane had given Wells final cut privilege
63760	68720	This is a movie term referring to who gets final say over the film that actually gets sent to theaters
68760	72560	This is a level of artistic control not normally given to first-time directors
73040	79560	If a director doesn't have this privilege the executives and producers at the company often make their own changes for commercial
79880	83520	Personal or other reasons and can override the creators wishes for their work
83520	91040	Wells used Final Cut to make a film seen by many nerd betas as the greatest ever when Wells next film with the same studio
91040	95800	The Magnificent Ambersons had mixed test screenings Wells made small changes
95800	99160	But remained confident the work was good and would be received better on a full release
99640	104720	However RKO felt otherwise and due to various contract negotiations
104800	109240	Wells had given up Final Cut privileges while Wells was working on another film in Brazil
109640	117800	RKO made extensive edits to the film including reshooting the ending to be completely different and cut 40 minutes out in Wells own words
117840	120920	What's left is only the first six reels
121080	127160	My whole third act is lost because of all of the hysterical tinkering that went on and it was
127360	132920	Genuinely lost too to save space in the film archives the removed segments of the film were destroyed
132920	140560	the creators ideal version of The Magnificent Ambersons is gone forever the released version of Ambersons is regarded by all four people who've seen it as
140840	147280	One of the best films ever and perhaps even better than Citizen Kane, but that only makes the whole thing more horrible
147480	149720	We can only imagine what it could have been
150280	155240	This was the beginning of Wells long fight for creative control over his projects a fight
155240	160680	He seemed to lose most of the time Wells went on to make lots of other films during his career and some of them are
160680	165120	Still really good, but in many ways a lot of them were never truly his
165520	170560	Wells was open about things he wished he'd done differently or more ideal versions of his films
170560	176120	He even considered doing a new ending of Magnificent Ambersons 30 years later with the surviving actors
176280	180000	But these truer versions of his films never surfaced
180360	186120	Wells I argue was ahead of his time here what he was yearning to do was make
186640	192440	Directors cuts in the modern era the idea that a film will get a director's cut is almost taken for granted
192840	200440	In fact, it's so widely accepted that the director's cut is the most authentic version of a film that some fans of the DC superhero
200440	206680	movies are asking specifically for a Snyder cut of Justice League under the impression that this would
206920	210760	Inherently be the better version of the film than the version that some other later
210880	215760	Director would have made tens of thousands of dollars have been raised for charities in the process of fans
216080	220560	Demonstrating their desire to Warner Brothers now. I quite like a lot of Zack Snyder's films myself
220800	222880	The first step is admitting have a problem
222880	228100	And I'd love to see his version of Justice League and also unsee the version that Joss Whedon witty
228320	230160	Dialogue to himself all over
230160	233440	But I can't help but notice that we seem to now be living in an age
233640	236360	Where you can't just dislike a film and move on with your life
236480	243160	It's an opportunity to become even more engaged to give even more of your time to something you didn't even like in the hopes of
243160	247520	Getting a newer better version. So how did we get here and
248320	255720	Our directors cuts all that different that much of the time or isn't it somewhat bizarre to expect a director to relive a finished work?
255800	260040	In order to make a slightly better version of something that was already completed and released
260040	265000	And as a director really the main authority on the most ideal version of a work
265680	267360	Let's look at
267360	274160	let's look at some examples of directors cuts and how they're different from the originals and if they're actually that much better and
274640	280600	Just generally go on an adventure of discovery for what all this means for how we think about art in the modern era
281240	284120	That's that's pretty good. Doesn't it? Welcome back to scanline
296000	303560	Put succinctly a director's cut is a version of a motion picture that is edited according to the director's wishes and that usually
303760	307240	Includes scenes cut from the version created for general distribution
307560	312040	Wikipedia says Blade Runner was the first film to ever use the phrasing directors cut in marketing
312040	318780	But but the page doesn't actually cite a source to confirm this. So thanks Wikipedia
318780	324920	It's excellent excellent work there as the questions of creative control grow increasingly culturally pertinent and profitable
325000	328480	It's become more and more common for films to have a second release as a new
328920	335400	alternative version one more in line with the directors original wishes a sort of final cut privilege in retrospect a
335680	342760	Shocking amount of films have directors cuts now, which gives the impression they serve a creative need that goes unsatisfied in the original process
342760	348280	But creative control is more of a vague conceptual idea than a thing whose effects are truly measurable
348280	353280	Let's look at some tangible examples of differences between cuts and why they can be important
353280	358520	We might as well start with Blade Runner since it apparently started all this cite your sources. God damn it
361280	362600	Ridley Scott's
362600	367960	1982 sci-fi dystopian speculative fiction science fiction film blade run everyone knows what Blade Runner is
367960	371720	Why am I explaining Blade Runner is a very good movie? I think I've heard it's good
371720	376520	I've got a copy here in my editing program and I'm skipping through it looking for footage to use and wow, it seems great
376520	382220	It's got flying cars and a cool gun explores complex questions about personhood and what it even means to be human
382460	384460	It's got music. It's good. There's
384940	386940	some eyes in it and
386940	392820	Some eyes here and here this guy loves talking about seeing things with his eyes and then later he tells this guy
392820	394660	But all the stuff he's seen
394660	399740	Whoa, if I didn't know any better, I'd say there's some kind of theme going on here foolish Ridley
399740	404700	Don't you know themes are for book reports get all these images and ideas out of here before you poke someone's eye
404700	405580	Yeah, oh no
405580	409780	I'm doing it the movie had mixed reception upon its release to quote Brian J
409780	415560	Rob's guide to Ridley Scott critical reaction was decidedly mixed the New York Times called it muddled yet
415860	419540	Mesmerizing Time magazine said the film like its setting is a beautiful
419780	427220	Deadly organism that devours life and the Los Angeles Times complained blade crawler might be more like it got him
427220	433620	Oh fuck him up Sheila the film while good had some confusing choices and strange problems
433620	435300	There's a lot of beautifully subtle
435300	440660	Storytelling and world-building where the viewer is given the chance to think for themselves and pick up on what's happening by paying attention
440980	446700	You know the score pal. You're not cop your little people and yet there's this terrible voiceover
446700	453340	And I'd rather be a killer than a victim and that's exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant the voiceover
453540	458860	Explains away everything even remotely subtle and it sounds like Harrison Ford is bored out of his mind
459020	464620	there's a lot of really beautiful storytelling like when Deckard retires a female replicant and
464940	468260	Looking at her body feels genuinely awful about what he's done
468460	475420	The audience can see plainly what hunting down creatures who are effectively human and have done nothing wrong except want to live longer
475740	477300	Has done to him
477300	480740	But then the voiceover comes in just to make sure you know that's happening
480740	487180	Just in case you don't like being trusted to think the report would be routine retirement of a replicant
487180	491300	Which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. Oh
492140	494820	Deckard feels sympathy. I wouldn't have known
495020	499980	It's not like there's an actor in the frame showing me or anything by far. The worst one is legendary
500260	503260	We get this incredible moment of humanity from Roy Batty
503780	510020	Theoretically the antagonist of the movie as his lifespan runs out and he talks about the beauty of all the things he's seen
510060	515420	It's one of the greatest moments in film history. But hey, guess what decides to ruin it?
515420	522060	I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments. He loved life more than he ever had before
522060	522580	Oh
522580	525340	I think that guy likes being alive
525660	529020	Deckard and Rachel prepare to escape together and in a very tense moment
529260	533740	Deckard finds proof gaff has been in his apartment a calling card of his is left in there
533740	537900	then they leave and it's incredibly tense and suspenseful as the doors close and
538060	544740	Then suddenly after all this noirish tension and dystopian storytelling and eternal night and rain and neon BAM
545260	547580	upbeat music bright skies clean air
547900	554500	Deckard and Rachel are taking a nice drive in the woods and that crappy voiceover tells us actually Rachel was a special replicant who doesn't have
554500	556060	a built-in death date
556060	560700	Tyrella told me Rachel was special no termination date. Oh
561300	565420	Sure. Yeah, this ending doesn't feel weird at all in the last 30 seconds of the film
565420	570100	It all turned out to be okay, just a complete whiplash and why is that unicorn there?
570100	575260	So it was fine really good even but clearly flawed soon after its release
575260	578220	There was speculation that the studio had meddled with production
578220	585660	I mean that ending is literally just b-roll borrowed from The Shining a so-called work print of the film not entirely finished version made during
585660	592820	The editing process had been shown to test audiences and was speculated to have been significantly different and then edited down and in the early
592820	597660	90s, it started being shown in a limited theatrical run branded as a director's cut though
597660	604420	Scott had no actual say in this version's release either and publicly disowned this version the work print wasn't a finished version of the film
604420	608940	For example, it was missing the horrendous voiceover, which is obviously a positive thing to miss
608940	612320	There are no closing credits and it just ends on the words the end
612460	618060	But more importantly it doesn't the end with a horrible story ruining tacked on happy ending
618060	624800	It ends in the elevator with Deckard and Rachel with all the horrible feelings of uncertainty and doom that come with not knowing what happens
624800	630600	Next and that Rachel probably doesn't have long to live even if Gaff spared her the unicorn thing is still weird, though
630600	635680	I guess Gaff is just a quirky guy who likes to spare people and do origami to be fair
635680	637160	I'm a pretty big fan of sparing people
637160	641280	I even showed Kurt mercy even though he showed me no gratitude for it
641280	645120	The work print was surprisingly popular and the differences were lauded as positive ones
645280	648880	This caused Warner Brothers to begin work on a proper director's cut
649080	656040	Well, not actually a director's cut someone else was put in charge of doing it and Scott just got to provide notes and consult on it
656040	663160	Warner Brothers seemed to be banking on the idea of releasing a director's cut and all the ideas of creative freedom that
663160	669800	Implied to fans and film buffs but not in actually giving the actual director that actual freedom
669800	676020	The director's cut is so much better than the original when trying to explain what the differences actually are
676180	682100	There aren't exactly that many major changes if you just list them out largely it's about what's not there anymore
682180	685260	There's no voiceovers whatsoever and the happy ending has been removed
685260	688140	It's amazing what bigger difference the lack of voiceover has though
688140	693220	It lets all the actors and performances breathe instead of being told what to think about something
693340	698780	They're simply being shown it and expected to think for themselves and that's really powerful
699620	701620	Hey Shannon
702380	704320	Yeah, okay when you're editing this bit
704320	707460	I want it to slowly digitally zoom on my face
707620	711140	While I get emotional about how good Blade Runner is and you know
711140	715820	We can play like some knockoff tears in rain music. We can get Zoe blade to do it. It'll be great
715820	719700	It'll be really funny reference Harris. I don't I don't think that works in a video essay
720100	727220	Yeah, but I want it and I'm the director. Yeah. Well, I'm doing a lot of the editing and I might not edit it like that
728220	735260	Maybe in the final cut of this video 20 years later, you can finally achieve your dumb vision. Oh, I get it
735260	736260	That's very meta
736260	742580	And I mean honestly he's like speaking as your co-writer the parts of the video that you wrote are full of holes in your research
742820	745700	Like the cockatoo scene in Citizen Kane isn't the first jump scare
745940	751380	It was most likely popularized by cat people in 1942 with the lootin bus. There's a scene with a bus
751380	753820	It's the first ever like well-known jump scare
753820	757660	Yeah, but it's a funny joke in it and we get to explain the cockatoo and that's pretty good
757660	761540	It's a it's a very light-hearted opening. It doesn't have to be completely true. Oh
762500	768820	Now I'm explaining my joke. I spent ages convincing myself. That bit was funny now. It's ruined
769180	774860	By the way, what happened to the footage of me driving to McDonald's for 15 minutes and talking about how much I love tapes for
774860	776860	The last video. Did you just take it out?
777140	781860	Am I gonna have to start a petition to release the Harris cut of the VHS episode of Scanline
782060	784860	Is that really gonna have to happen now? You know what?
785420	791700	Forget it. I'm cutting this whole part out. It interrupts your explanation of the director's cut and honestly, it's a little bit indulgent
791700	798460	What no, you can't do that. My overly indulgent directors intent is being violated. You can't just
799380	803660	But most importantly and I can't stress enough how cool a change this is
804100	810980	Midway through the movie while Deckard plays idly on his piano. He begins to have a dream and he dreams
811740	813540	about a unicorn
813540	820180	Holy shit. I mean, holy shit. What a small simple change and yet the difference is amazing
820180	826700	I mean firstly finally someone in the movie based on the book do androids dream of electric sheep has someone having a dream in it
826700	834340	But more importantly now the origami unicorn gaff leaves behind means something because how could gaff know Deckard's dreams?
834740	842140	This implies that maybe Deckard is also a replicant who believes he's human with implanted dreams and memories. It's still ambiguous
842580	849460	Obviously, I mean maybe gaff also dreams about unicorns humans do don't they this ambiguity to me
849460	852180	At least is the point of the film ultimately
852180	857060	It doesn't matter whether Deckard is a replicant because he would still be equally a person
857260	864300	human in all but name and it's only in this cut many years after its release that this point really gets to be made and
864300	868700	All this stuff is brought up by the simple inclusion of a daydream about a unicorn
868900	873140	It's kind of amazing how much a simple change just a couple of seconds of new footage
873340	876500	Can impact the overall meaning and value of an entire film?
876500	880980	I think this better than anything else in any other film can demonstrate the sheer power
881180	885940	Editing can have on a movie quoting here from Rob's book again ten years later in
886500	892420	1992 with the release of the director's cut the film received the welcome it deserved according to the Washington Post
892700	898140	The film is great on every level the poignant screenplay about a man's futile quest for immortality
898700	903940	Scott's tremendous direction the incredible futuristic sets designed by Lawrence G
903940	909380	Paul Sid Mead and the others the phenomenal special effects and the touching performances
909780	913180	Especially from Hauer a replicant fighting against the ebbing of his life
913300	918220	His swan song is one of the most touching in modern movie history quick aside
918220	922940	Maybe people would have been more willing to recognize his performance if there hadn't been a fucking voiceover right after it
922940	927340	What's interesting about this director's cut though is that it wasn't actually the director's cut
927540	933260	it's ironic that one of the most famous examples of a director's cut is not actually a director's cut and
933500	939580	Studios were already capitalizing on the idea of a director's cut to sell a movie, but we'll get back to that later
939860	945420	15 years later. There was a final cut of Blade Runner, which was made with Scott finally in complete control
945780	952340	It's essentially a version of the director's cut with slightly different editing better effects some changes in color grading
952500	956980	Harrison Ford's son came in to reshoot a few minor things to make mouth movements that fit the ADR
956980	961820	Oh and most importantly the shot of the bird flying away at the end finally matches the rest of the fucking scene
961940	964340	It took 25 years, but we did it everyone
964340	966700	It's not really a necessary version of the film
966700	971260	But it's nice that Scott finally got to make a version he properly had control over
971780	974180	After the success of the director's cut of Blade Runner
974500	979500	Director's cuts became increasingly common the most famous other example of this is also by Ridley Scott
979700	983740	Kingdom of Heaven's original release was very divisive and pretty poorly received overall
984060	988700	Critics and audiences generally found it unsatisfying often boring and lacking in depth
988700	994900	It was so bad that Roger Ebert a film critic from opposite land who says the wrong thing almost all the time because he's a hack
995060	998620	Gave it three and a half stars out of four and said it was better than gladiator
999140	1004660	Three and a half stars. I'm not saying Roger Ebert's taste is questionable, but just putting it out there
1004660	1006660	That's the rating he gave to The Phantom Menace
1007180	1011820	Okay, actually I take it back Roger Ebert's great people are really uncharitable to The Phantom Menace
1011820	1018100	It's actually pretty good Kingdom of Heaven then got a director's cut released on DVD with 45 minutes of new material
1018100	1025300	Which massively expands the story alters the roles of the main characters and turns the film into a genuine masterpiece of historical epicness?
1025300	1030220	And fleshes out Orlando Bloom's role so much that it transforms into his best ever
1030580	1038220	Performance and also frankly his only performance there are hundreds of directors cuts now many of which arguably improved the movie
1038500	1041260	Most of them have much less drastic changes than these
1041260	1047620	But it's clear that even small changes can make a big difference and as with the final cut even if there's next to no difference
1047620	1054620	The point is the creator getting to achieve their vision unsullied by previous meddling. That is the point right isn't it?
1055220	1061620	Well, not all alternative cuts of films exist for this reason artistic intent and creative ambition
1062260	1063740	Aren't set in stone
1063740	1068380	Okay time to get personal as a creator who's got a lot of stuff out there that he can't
1068580	1071900	Meaningfully go back and change without releasing it as a whole new thing
1072060	1075660	There are tons of things that I would do differently now in retrospect or
1075900	1081260	Mistakes that I genuinely would love to go back and fix when I make YouTube videos for my own personal channel
1081260	1085420	I inherently have final cut privilege. No one can tell me what to do
1085460	1090420	There is no executive producer with any oversight or control and when I work with a sponsor
1090420	1095580	I tell them I'm not gonna make any changes even if they ask and they just are gonna have to live with what I make
1095980	1097100	so
1097100	1102500	Basically, I am at all times free to unleash my unmitigated
1103140	1109860	Creative vision upon the world, but what if my unmitigated creative vision isn't perfect the first time around?
1110060	1113860	what if I make genuine mistakes or change my mind or
1114660	1120260	Couldn't afford to do something or just didn't have the talent to creative the things I
1120860	1121980	visioned
1121980	1123740	That's got to be pretty
1123740	1127380	Unmitigating right there. Most of the time directors cuts for me would be things like
1128020	1133420	Rerecording voiceover to sound a bit less echoey or a bit less mouth clicky that sound
1133420	1139460	I hate when I hear myself making that sound it's awful or remove jokes that I realized weren't actually very funny in retrospect or
1139660	1144420	Worse are actually casually ableist and I just hadn't noticed or fix that time
1144420	1148580	I accidentally left an arrow at 2% opacity at the top of the screen by accident
1148580	1151100	So fully fading it out and it's there for half the fucking video
1151220	1155020	So getting another run at the project isn't always fully about control
1155020	1162020	It's about making improvements that you feel you could do now and a lot of directors cuts are more in line with this way of thinking
1162220	1167740	One director is famous for changing his mind about something after releasing a film that he thought was fine at the time and that
1168180	1175820	Director's name is Paul Thomas Anderson when Magnolia came out it was well-received but considered by some to be a little on the long side
1176260	1180060	Anderson defended the decisions he made for his film and seemed pretty happy with it
1180060	1186420	And I was really upfront, you know saying it's gonna be three hours and you know, they were wonderful in saying, okay
1186420	1190460	We're not gonna tell you what to do. We'd love it if this was shorter, you know
1190460	1192700	But but so just make it as short as you can
1192700	1198940	But the interesting thing about time is it makes you rethink your work a little sometimes this movie at this moment
1198940	1204380	The one that is in the theaters today. Yeah, it's the movie you wanted to make exactly
1204580	1207460	Is it the movie you set out to me exactly?
1207460	1213860	But if you were given the opportunity to do another cut of it, oh, I'd slice that thing down
1215700	1220780	It's way too fucking long good. Oh, no, it's it's it's unmerciful how long it is
1220780	1222980	No director's cut of Magnolia has been released
1223100	1227860	But it's useful knowing directors might have made their own films differently with the benefit of hindsight
1228300	1234060	Even when they defended them at the time Sam Raimi had complete control over Evil Dead his first film to the point
1234060	1239220	He places the failure of his next film Crime Wave on there being too much oversight compared to Evil Dead
1239220	1245980	They replaced my actors. They threw Bruce Campbell out of the lead. They threw out my musician Joe LaDuca
1246180	1252260	They recut the picture. They had their own say with the sound effects and mix they
1253380	1258900	Did everything they could to make it what it is today. Do you see Crime Wave?
1258940	1260940	I
1260980	1263860	Saw that movie on an airplane and people still walked out
1265180	1271300	Edie was independently financed largely by whoever Raimi and his friends could get to give them money so they could do whatever they wanted
1271300	1276100	We didn't have nearly the freedom as our first film because investors aren't gonna come on the set
1276260	1279340	Dennis isn't gonna say are you sure that camera angles, right?
1279340	1284820	But this freedom doesn't mean Raimi was necessarily going to be happy forever with all aspects of the film he made
1285020	1289580	There's a controversial segment in the film where a woman is sexually assaulted by demonic trees
1289660	1293660	the scene is far more gruesome than anything else in the film and it's definitely a
1293740	1299280	Contributing factor to it being regarded as one of the video nasties in the UK and getting an NC-17 in the US
1299340	1304660	Plus it was banned in other countries with different releases subject to various different cuts over the years in
1305140	1308740	Retrospect Raimi isn't happy with that scene and talks about this openly
1308740	1314340	well, I think it was unnecessarily gratuitous and a little too brutal and I finally because
1314820	1321780	People were offended in a way that I did. My goal is not to offend people. It is to entertain thrill scare
1323140	1325300	Make them laugh but not to offend them
1325900	1328500	Regret putting it in I do I do
1329060	1334700	Piers Haggard felt precisely the same way about his folk horror film the blood on Satan's claw the rape scene now
1335260	1340780	I think it's probably too strong and it's interesting that I wasn't bothered at the time. I think you
1341660	1343660	Will find most directors
1344300	1348460	If they get their teeth into a sequence, which is going to be really powerful
1349140	1354060	They become completely seduced and I was seduced by the sheer dramatic power
1354260	1357660	Directors have these kinds of regrets or change their minds about stuff all the time
1357860	1362860	Although of course no studio has helped them re-release these films with the sexual assaults cut
1362860	1368820	I guess adding in more unicorns is more important than ameliorating excessive sexual violence on film
1368820	1372060	Some directors actually do get to make their ideal changes though
1372060	1377140	The Coen brothers who did some work on the editing of Evil Dead and later worked closely with Raimi on other projects
1377140	1382980	Got to do a director's cut of blood simple despite also being in charge of the original cut blood simple is awesome
1382980	1387220	It's very different from the rest of their films, but not tangibly worse just different
1387220	1392740	It's a very stripped down thriller. The director's cut is even more streamlined. It's about three minutes shorter
1392820	1397020	No scenes have been outright cut but a lot of shots have been trimmed down in length
1397020	1400580	So the feel is much tighter. These changes are very small
1400620	1404020	The director's cut is arguably tighter and better edited
1404180	1409020	But also not different enough that I don't think anyone who didn't like it would like it that much more
1409020	1414060	And I don't think anyone who really likes the movie thinks that much better of it because of this version either
1414060	1417940	I'm reminded here of Orson Welles complaining about hysterical tinkering
1417980	1422540	What exactly was the purpose of all this? The film is theoretically better
1422540	1430300	But I find it strange that people would go back to create a slightly better version of something that already existed and was fine
1430300	1434140	Now I love the Coen brothers as much as the next pretentious white nerd boy
1434140	1438260	But frankly if there's any evidence that director's cuts are actually a bad idea
1438300	1446700	This is exhibit a aren't mistakes something we ought to accept rather than hope to eventually see slightly touched up later in one
1446700	1450660	Of the many documentaries about Blade Runner one called all our variant futures
1450660	1454660	A lot of attention is paid to all the mistakes being fixed in the final cut
1454660	1457940	But a lot is also made of the charm of some of the mistakes
1458180	1464100	Gaff's eye color changing things like that and it's clear a lot of thought went into when one mistake is something to be
1464140	1468500	Corrected to improve the quality of the work and when other mistakes bring their own
1468620	1474060	Character to the film and ought to be left alone aren't all these mistakes part of the film though
1474300	1476420	Should an artist be allowed to
1476980	1483260	Perpetually alter their work once it's been handed over to the public in a 1993 article in the journal film comment
1483420	1490900	Film scholar and critic Greg Solomon wrote uncertain glory directors cut editions the redemption of an art or the first step on a slippery slope
1491340	1496500	He said viewing film art as perpetually subject to update and correction
1496660	1501220	Political or other says something about the directors relationship to their work in a way
1501300	1509340	They redress artistic grievances by treating movies as mere product in this country and an alienable right to change as an
1509340	1511700	artist doesn't extend to changing art and
1512380	1520540	therefore art history rather than artistic deliverance the DC trend represents a significant disturbance of film history and
1521220	1527300	Equally important the popular cultural memory of the original audiences even kitsch merits protection
1527300	1532380	The directors cut means the practical elimination of a film record and that the market
1532700	1538660	Valorizes the new to the point that it supplants the old version and despite what the misnomer directors cut implies
1538860	1542380	This movement augurs poorly for the rise of the Hollywood auteur
1542420	1547740	There's certainly no amelioration of the compromise between strict studio and enterprising director
1548140	1555500	Essential to evaluating their personal commitment to circumvention of studio Philistines in the end the same old commerce here
1555700	1561220	Masquerades as the aesthetics of creative freedom the ending to his piece is appropriately dramatic
1561340	1568060	Our film culture faces a future in which old movies will not just seem different from how we remembered them
1568060	1572700	They will be the theatrical release is fast becoming a work in progress
1573340	1577480	Original versions soon will exist only in the fragments of our collective memory
1577820	1582640	Then to quote the authority all those moments will be lost in time
1583300	1585300	like tears in
1585340	1592740	Rain in a much more recent piece Alex roses or tears gone wild why the directors cut often turns into an axe murder in the American
1592740	1596960	Scholar from 2010 Rose says directors couldn't leave well enough alone
1596960	1604940	They redressed their early classics in ever gaudier clothing and attempts to reclaim their youthful eminence since corrupted by years of compromise
1605700	1612020	Rose calls directors cuts an indulgence saying even the subtleties while peripheral and seemingly innocuous
1612340	1618820	Have their effects an extra cutaway here a quick reaction shot there and suddenly the gags aren't quite as funny
1618820	1623420	The sex scenes aren't as breathless the fights lose their drive the dialogue drags
1623660	1629700	Just a little more padding and primping and the intangible gestalt of the original is lost
1630220	1635380	Indulgence is a death sentence a reliable antidote. However is the adoption of
1635980	1640620	Constraints and what other medium would colossal vanity be permitted much less encouraged
1641220	1647660	Solman says typically the commercially successful rather than the artistically worthy enjoys studio benevolence
1647940	1652860	Same as it ever was in a reader's response section in a film comment from later in the year
1653060	1656460	Gordon Hale from Philadelphia has a prescient comment on Solman's piece
1656460	1662820	He describes Tom Richardson re-editing Tom Jones then says as films grow older and their copyrights expire
1663180	1669140	Both the artists and the moneymen will have the same incentive to prepare new editions
1669340	1674540	Qualifying for new copyrights original versions will then be withdrawn completely new improved
1674900	1682740	Editions will abound just like toothpaste and detergent and the example Solomon cites will seem like a drop in the bucket
1683500	1688740	So even though I like blood simple, I really quite like that. There is a director's cut of blood simple
1688740	1693740	I love the Coen brothers and I'm glad that they have the power to go back and do that if they want
1694020	1699740	It still manages to pose a lot of difficult questions about how much power a director should have over their art and
1699900	1706460	Whether or not directors cuts are actually as anti-commercial as they seem to be. Maybe there's a certain confidence or
1706900	1709740	Honesty in not going back and making changes
1709980	1715900	Anderson and Ramey have criticisms of their old films as anyone who gets years to look back on their work ought to do
1715900	1721860	But they aren't going back and making changes to things that are already a part of history in order to satisfy those criticisms
1722100	1726100	It's okay to learn and move on for things to not be perfect
1726100	1729940	it may well be that the ability to go back and change something if you want to
1730300	1735020	Poses just as much of a threat to the integrity of art as any meddling studio
1735340	1738740	Sometimes the directors changes don't just not make the film any better
1738900	1745620	But they actively make it worse and what director's name springs to mind better than Francis Ford Coppola
1745940	1751060	Apocalypse now is a really good film and it better be because it took forever to make and would have destroyed Coppola's
1751380	1752540	Coppola's
1752540	1758660	Coppola's career if it hadn't but it was good. So it meant Coppola kept his career and was free to go on to make
1761820	1766500	Apocalypse now is a really good film but in a very interesting way at nearly two and a half hours
1766500	1767380	It's pretty long
1767380	1773460	But the pacing of the movie is so good all the scenes flow so perfectly and the dreamlike
1773460	1779940	Descent into madness is so well-defined that it's pleasant to sit through you kind of slip into it
1779940	1784140	It doesn't feel its length at all. If you showed me the movie and told me it was 90 minutes
1784140	1788860	I would probably believe you in 2001 Coppola released apocalypse now Redux
1789660	1797980	Redux Redux Redux an extended cut with reworked editing and more scenes added in this new version is three hours and 22 minutes
1798300	1804260	More content squeezed out of the content tube onto the conveyor belt of cinema. Yes, please
1804940	1808540	apocalypse now good film great film arguably a
1809060	1810700	masterpiece
1810700	1812700	apocalypse now Redux
1812940	1819060	Garbage the whole thing is fucking terrible. He ruined it. I hate you so much Francis
1822380	1827220	When you shoot over a million feet of footage to make your masterpiece
1827220	1829060	Which yeah, I guess is an achievement
1829060	1835260	It turns out that most of that footage is piss and you probably shouldn't put all of it in the film
1835300	1840700	The additional scenes utterly destroy the pacing of the original so while it's technically only
1841580	1845060	Almost an hour longer. It feels five hours longer
1845140	1848540	I've seen the Redux version twice and both times
1848540	1853780	I had to pause and do something else for a while like take a nap or watch a different better film
1853940	1857220	The long-ass plantation scene adds so little to the film
1857220	1862820	It effectively takes away from it by distracting from what the film had successfully focused on more by being shorter
1862820	1867420	Just because some of the stuff in a film is good doesn't mean you can put an entire kitchen. Oh fuck
1868420	1875380	All the tiny scenes of humor or light-hearted escapes from the darkness are washed away by the sheer scope of the thing
1875380	1880620	It just keeps on going and it's boring and drags to the point of being actively painful
1880620	1884500	Ha I slapped my meat too hard against the walls of my set
1885260	1887140	They're all hurting now
1887140	1891540	Luckily since it turns out that directors intent is a super malleable concept
1891540	1897140	It appears that Coppola has changed his mind yet again about what his film is supposed to be this year for the 40th anniversary
1897580	1900180	He's releasing the apocalypse now final cut
1900620	1905980	Directors cut number three at this point, which is actually 20 minutes shorter than the Redux version
1905980	1912260	I'm curious if this version of the film manages to maintain the amazing feel of the original but honestly, I doubt it
1912780	1919060	Coppola already made a really good version of his film 40 years ago. He had his final cut take it away from him now
1919060	1922980	He's done. It was fine. I haven't seen this version of the film because I don't
1923500	1927300	Care, but it is coming to a theater right next to me in September
1927300	1932420	So I basically have no choice to eventually see it and in the director's cut of this video. I will
1932980	1936820	Put my impressions of the film here and let you know what I thought of it
1937740	1940500	And that video will come out in 20 years
1941500	1943740	Or when I hit a million subscribers
1944700	1946700	Whichever comes first
1949660	1951980	Incidentally years ago when I was talking to one of my many
1952580	1957540	Pretentious film friends who I secretly hate I studied documentary production at uni you run into these people
1957540	1961380	It's an occupational hazard and I was explaining to her how much I hated apocalypse now Redux
1961380	1964740	But then she asked me have you heard about the work print?
1965140	1970220	She then went on to explain that there is a leaked work print of the movie, which is five hours
1970820	1974260	Long the ten minute long song the end by the doors
1974740	1978540	Plays in its entirety in the opening in this version of the film
1978820	1982860	What were they thinking was the intent to make a film that long at some point?
1983140	1988020	Did they think people would watch it were they developing an experimental new torture device?
1988820	1993700	Don't watch it even if you can find it leaked online somewhere. Just don't watch it
1993700	2001860	It's not worth stealing this draft of apocalypse now much like the actual draft is something that you're morally obliged to dodge
2002140	2007820	So here's an even more evolved version of the blood simple problem directors are going back and re-re-editing
2008100	2012740	Their films to try to undo some of the damage they did in the first re-edit
2012740	2019380	The slippery slope was real and one of the best directors ever is actively tumbling down it right now
2020020	2022500	Hysterically tinkering with his film again
2022620	2028820	But there's actually an even more egregious example of a director making a silly edit to their film and everyone wanting the original back
2029420	2033580	That's right. You all knew it was coming. I'm talking about Steven Spielberg
2034140	2039620	ET the extraterrestrial is a pretty good movie, but 20 years later Spielberg decided some changes were necessary
2040060	2046740	The kids in this scene are in way too much danger look some of those cops have guns well now in this version
2046740	2048100	They have walkie-talkies
2048100	2053980	Phew now the kids are never in any danger as they fly hundreds of feet in the air on fucking bicycles
2053980	2060140	It appears that even Steven has gone on to regret this decision or at the very least makes sure the original is still available
2060580	2065460	So this is an example of a director deciding they want something changed going to great
2065820	2069540	Technological lengths to get it changed and then having second thoughts
2069820	2074140	This whole directorial freedom to go back and change your films as important thing is
2074500	2080900	Starting to look a little bit flimsy in the face of directors making changes that they then decide were bad
2081300	2086340	There's probably an example of a director being even worse than this, but whoa whoops. Oh look
2086340	2089180	We're out of time for this episode of scan
2090180	2091900	fine
2091900	2093900	We all want to talk about him
2094020	2101540	It's time to talk about Federico Fellini fine George Lucas George Lucas is amazing and revolutionary science fiction film
2102060	2109620	THX 1138 is an ass-kickingly depressing and bizarre prediction of the future that makes some really incisive comments about modern consumerism
2110140	2117180	Characters literally buy weird plastic shapes just for the joy of having purchased something then throw them in the trash in
2118140	2124340	1977 George Lucas predicted Funko pop the original theatrical version had five minutes taken out against Lucas's wishes
2124620	2127900	After the success of a couple of above-average fantasy films
2127900	2132740	He made a bit later Lucas got to release a restored version with that footage added back in which is nice
2132740	2134900	He got his movie back in line with his vision
2134900	2140540	But then George started deciding that his films couldn't just be brought into accordance with his original vision
2140820	2142980	No, they could be retrospectively
2143740	2144940	improved
2144940	2151980	I'm sure you all know about this already, but in 2004 George Lucas released the director's cut of
2152660	2158900	THX 1138 I'm doing another fake out this director's cut adds a bunch of CGI and some new shots and effects
2158900	2161180	It's two minutes longer, and it's just kind of needless
2161460	2165260	It's nice that his film got to be properly mastered and restored I guess
2165420	2169980	But the level of meddling with a thing that was really finished decades prior is unnecessary
2170020	2174500	The film doesn't need some more CGI scenes added in years later
2174580	2179900	It was already great if an old thing has flaws or isn't perfect or you change your mind about it
2180340	2184540	Sometimes it's okay to let it go. Well that about wraps it up for this episode of
2184900	2186900	GEORGE
2189460	2190700	George
2190700	2192700	Mr.. Lucas, I
2192860	2197220	Love your films. I love you as a person. I love you as a thinker
2197220	2201300	I think you're an amazing man and Star Wars is an absolute blessing
2201300	2207300	I love all of them even the prequels have some great stuff in there my contract with Shannon obliges me not to defend the
2207300	2211260	Prequels too hard in a video attached to her name, but you know how I feel
2211940	2214980	You've read my emails, but come on
2216020	2217620	What were you doing?
2217620	2223260	did we really need hand to be marginally less of a scoundrel by making him shoot second and
2223700	2229420	Then did we really need him to shoot second while also awkwardly CGI dodging a close-range laser blast
2229860	2233980	Did we really need R2 to be hidden slightly more behind the rocks?
2234300	2239420	Making it a little more believable that he couldn't be seen but making us wonder how we even got in there
2239420	2245260	Did we really need to remove a cool scene from Return of the Jedi just to show off the amazing new CGI?
2245260	2249700	You could do now did we need this this part looks better on VHS by the way
2249700	2252700	I wonder if someone has done a video about why that would be but come on, bro
2253220	2256340	Even you think the hand stuff is silly now George
2256340	2259420	I loved your work genuinely and completely
2259580	2265300	But it's on you that it's such a hassle to see the original unedited versions people saw and loved in the theater
2265300	2269220	And that's just not fair even if those versions don't line up with your vision
2269820	2273020	Spielberg did the right thing making sure the versions people loved are still available
2273580	2279460	Because movies don't just belong to directors to their supposed auteurs. They also belong to culture
2279460	2283700	You can have your version of the movie, but the people ought to have theirs
2283700	2287700	I genuinely find you and your work hugely inspirational
2287900	2293260	But the way access to the originals was deliberately obscured by you was really disappointing
2293780	2301660	All these different kinds of directors cut with differing resulting effects, well, they really complicate all this don't they?
2303500	2307420	So yeah studios mess with films often irrevocably
2307740	2312660	It's nice that sometimes an unmessed version can manifest but the problem is
2313260	2316820	Artists and audiences have been enamored with the concept of this
2317500	2319780	Directors run the risk of falling down a rabbit hole
2320460	2325020	Continuously re-editing their work once it's already out like it's in early access or something
2325260	2332700	Changing their minds about what their own visions even were and sometimes even helping to obscure the versions people know and love from history
2333180	2337300	Worse than this what makes a director an authority on what the film should be?
2337900	2342900	Directors are a small part of a project the producers writers editors actors
2343380	2348020	Artists set designers all these people are so important and valuable on any project
2348300	2354260	That it seems almost rude to pretend the director is the one who should decide what the film they all made is
2354420	2360220	It takes a village to raise a child and the mayor of the village shouldn't get to say that child belongs to them
2360220	2362580	This problem hits me on a personal level
2362580	2368300	In fact, the last scanline video did surprisingly well and made it into some lists of best video essays
2368540	2374620	But often it was credited directly to me when scanline is a collaborative show between me and Shannon Strucci
2374820	2381900	Whose name was above mine in the credits we share writing editing and other creative duties. She's editing this part right now
2381900	2388340	I'm just doing the voiceover. It's really nice that we got recognized for our work, but it's our work not mine
2388540	2395340	I'm not trying to call anyone out here, but being credited for work. That wasn't simply mine makes me a little uncomfortable
2395860	2401380	It's an easy mistake to make the video is posted on my channel where most of the videos are purely my work
2401380	2407980	But I think this misunderstanding is also an extension of how we relate to art right now as products of central
2408180	2414700	Individuals and not the many other people who work on something or the surrounding situation that led to it on that note
2414700	2420140	I think what people like is the idea constructed by the concept of directors cuts
2420420	2428100	We like to imagine films as a struggle between true creators and the false moneymen as a battle to realize
2428340	2433100	Someone's vision. It's a compelling narrative and maybe it's a little true
2433100	2440420	The idea that there's an authentic version of a film is kind of beautiful and that makes the struggle to try and get that version
2440700	2442220	Seem almost romantic
2442220	2449360	But this narrative has been repackaged and sold back to us in the form of special editions of Terminator 2 with a couple more
2449360	2453600	Scenes and box sets of every version of Blade Runner for us to compare and contrast
2454200	2459360	Think about that Warner Brothers are responsible for the theatrical cut and here they are
2459800	2463760	Selling us the fixed version of a film that was broken by them
2464240	2467040	We like to think of works as made by one person
2467680	2469400	products of their own vision
2469400	2474600	When nothing is that simple the tears in rain monologue the best part of Blade Runner by far
2474960	2476560	Wasn't made by Ridley Scott
2476560	2479120	It wasn't even written by the writer not completely
2479520	2486200	Rutger Hauer modified the monologue the night before making it shorter and feel more human and added the most famous line
2486640	2491920	And then you know I came up with the line all those moments will be lost in time like tears and rain
2494040	2498680	Knowing this the idea that it's all up to some sole creator and their mystical intent
2498960	2504280	Only obscures the reality of filmmaking and trains us to desire a purity of vision
2504280	2506000	That's completely unattainable
2506000	2513000	Makes us go out and buy more products for the joy of obtaining an even more perfected version of one person's idea
2513160	2516280	even if that idea was bad and keeps changing even
2516720	2518800	necessitating more versions and then
2519560	2524160	Unbroken versions so that you still have the original and it just goes on and on forever
2524720	2531640	When does the consumption end and the art begin there are no easy answers to questions about art the best
2531640	2533320	I can muster right now is
2533320	2538520	Directors cuts are certainly a valid idea and they can arguably improve the quality of a film
2539000	2545720	But this idea is also easily co-opted into the exact same commercialism that necessitated them in the first place
2545920	2553080	The idea that the director is the one person who should have final say on the most ideal version of a work is a highly
2553400	2558880	Ideological assumption which says more about how we think about film than it actually says about the medium itself
2558960	2561880	But that's a whole can of worms that we'll have to get into at a later date
2561880	2564240	I guess at some point we should maybe explore what
2564840	2570680	Authorship actually is and whether the author is alive or not and what the hell or term means
2571480	2575000	Join us on the next scanline when we discuss how meaning is constructed. Oh
2575800	2578640	Great. I'm gonna have to read books
2579120	2585120	But if anything what all this examination of cuts seems to relate is the power of editing
2585120	2591320	we've seen just how much very small changes can affect the feel of a whole sequence or the meaning of a story an
2591520	2594800	Editor can make a bad film great and a really good film
2595080	2596480	terrible and boring
2596480	2598480	Editing is such an important part of the process
2598560	2603720	That some people spend years of their lives or an awful lot of money learning how to do it too much money
2603720	2608760	Frankly, luckily we here at scanline have put together a functioning simulation of a film school
2608960	2616960	Hi Shannon here this cut here where the sound starts first is a great technique for drawing people into your film to do it
2616960	2622400	You just you you you just have the audio start first. See it's under the video on the timeline
2622400	2626360	So it looks like a J. It's called a J cut J. That's how you do a J cut. Okay. Thank you
2626360	2628160	That's film school. That'll be
2628880	2635600	If only there was a cheaper way to get someone to share the skills required to learn editing
2637000	2640760	Well, wait, hang on Skillshare is an online learning platform for creators
2640760	2642280	If you want to learn how to be an editor
2642280	2648560	Don't do what I did and try to teach yourself for ten years fellow youtuber Jordi van der putt has a class on editing in
2648560	2655760	Adobe Premiere that takes three hours and 22 minutes the exact length of apocalypse now Redux and a much better use of your time
2655960	2659720	Jordi's cutting animating and color correcting tips are like the decade
2659720	2664120	I spent teaching it to myself only in fast-forward and actually taught me a couple new things
2664120	2665920	I hadn't realized you could do so easily
2665920	2668760	I'm a little embarrassed about that and better yet
2668760	2674800	It didn't cost an entire college tuition an annual subscription to the entire platform is less than $10 a month
2674880	2678040	But if you click on the link in the description or go to skl.sh
2678840	2683340	Slash hbomberguy you can get two months of free access to these classes and over
2683780	2690520	25,000 more I talked about time management skills in a video a couple months ago and on that note Thomas Frank's productivity master class
2690700	2694660	Genuinely improved my life in measurable ways. Hold on. Do you hear this?
2696740	2699700	That's my filing cabinet, which I have now
2699700	2705580	I used to keep all the invoices for music and art and stuff in a big pile in the corner and leave to-do lists
2705580	2707580	everywhere and now I have a system that actually
2707660	2712260	Works and getting things done is much less daunting if stuff like that might be of interest to you
2712260	2714260	once again, that link is

2717700	2719220	Slash hbomberguy
2719220	2721220	So yeah director's cuts can be good
2721820	2723660	Often they aren't Francis
2723660	2727820	But on the whole it's clear why this is an aspect of film worth focusing on
2727900	2731900	Because as we've seen films really can be greatly altered by even tiny
2732180	2739500	Removals or additions cinema is often as much in here as it is on the screen. But what we see on the screen with our
2740020	2741420	eyes
2741420	2747420	Facilitates our emotions and beliefs and imaginations our collective reverence for alternative cuts
2747900	2754540	Reveals our understanding of the power films hold over us by learning just how differently the same idea can be expressed
2754860	2757020	We're learning more about how to express ourselves
2758180	2760180	Cinema is a powerful thing
2760460	2767720	Because it is an extension of the human soul. I've seen things that you people would believe because you've seen them, too
2768420	2770860	I've seen the addition of a daydream
2771460	2779020	Change how I feel about personhood and my entire understanding of a story. I've seen the addition of more things to something I like
2779580	2783420	Transform it into something I hate and I've seen thousands of people
2783820	2789580	Criticize a few scant frames of digital puppeteering because the original meant so much to them
2789580	2796700	And I'm glad that none of these moments will ever truly be lost because we have the power to share them with each other
2797700	2804700	Thank you for watching and that's when I realized that this guy might like
2805460	2807460	movies
2826700	2828700	I
2856700	2858700	I
2886700	2888700	I
2917500	2919500	I
2919860	2924420	Know this video is dedicated to the memory of Rutger Hauer who passed away this year
2925380	2931060	Incidentally 2019 is also the year in which Blade Runner was set. I find myself wondering
2931780	2934100	Which 2019 I'd rather live in
2934740	2939260	But frankly in both there are plenty of people who aren't being treated with the personhood they deserve
2940940	2942940	Go do something nice for someone today
