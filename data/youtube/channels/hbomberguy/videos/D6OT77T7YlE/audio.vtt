00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Citizen Kane is a film many scholars will tell you is the greatest of all time and some of them have even seen it

00:05.280 --> 00:08.160
So they must mean business. It was genuinely quite revolutionary

00:08.160 --> 00:14.400
It's credited with inventing or at least popularizing many cinematic techniques that are still used today, including the jump scare

00:15.880 --> 00:21.760
Everybody remembers that one scene where you suddenly cut to a cockatoo screeching just before it was to wake up the audience

00:23.440 --> 00:27.720
It's the entire significance of the cockatoo and a lot of it really holds up

00:27.880 --> 00:34.720
What's weird is you expect it to be a stuffy old thing vintage and prestigious and made for the amusement of old-timey people who?

00:34.720 --> 00:41.240
Don't think like we do today, but it can get properly funny and energetic at times hot take just putting this out there

00:41.840 --> 00:43.360
Citizen Kane

00:43.360 --> 00:48.520
Pretty good movie. It was the feature film debut of writer director and wine salesman Orson Welles

00:48.720 --> 00:51.800
Even while it was being made Kane was something of a rarity

00:52.280 --> 00:59.600
Despite being made by a first-time director the production company he was under contract with RKO pictures the studio famously behind King Kong and

01:00.720 --> 01:03.640
Citizen Kane had given Wells final cut privilege

01:03.760 --> 01:08.720
This is a movie term referring to who gets final say over the film that actually gets sent to theaters

01:08.760 --> 01:12.560
This is a level of artistic control not normally given to first-time directors

01:13.040 --> 01:19.560
If a director doesn't have this privilege the executives and producers at the company often make their own changes for commercial

01:19.880 --> 01:23.520
Personal or other reasons and can override the creators wishes for their work

01:23.520 --> 01:31.040
Wells used Final Cut to make a film seen by many nerd betas as the greatest ever when Wells next film with the same studio

01:31.040 --> 01:35.800
The Magnificent Ambersons had mixed test screenings Wells made small changes

01:35.800 --> 01:39.160
But remained confident the work was good and would be received better on a full release

01:39.640 --> 01:44.720
However RKO felt otherwise and due to various contract negotiations

01:44.800 --> 01:49.240
Wells had given up Final Cut privileges while Wells was working on another film in Brazil

01:49.640 --> 01:57.800
RKO made extensive edits to the film including reshooting the ending to be completely different and cut 40 minutes out in Wells own words

01:57.840 --> 02:00.920
What's left is only the first six reels

02:01.080 --> 02:07.160
My whole third act is lost because of all of the hysterical tinkering that went on and it was

02:07.360 --> 02:12.920
Genuinely lost too to save space in the film archives the removed segments of the film were destroyed

02:12.920 --> 02:20.560
the creators ideal version of The Magnificent Ambersons is gone forever the released version of Ambersons is regarded by all four people who've seen it as

02:20.840 --> 02:27.280
One of the best films ever and perhaps even better than Citizen Kane, but that only makes the whole thing more horrible

02:27.480 --> 02:29.720
We can only imagine what it could have been

02:30.280 --> 02:35.240
This was the beginning of Wells long fight for creative control over his projects a fight

02:35.240 --> 02:40.680
He seemed to lose most of the time Wells went on to make lots of other films during his career and some of them are

02:40.680 --> 02:45.120
Still really good, but in many ways a lot of them were never truly his

02:45.520 --> 02:50.560
Wells was open about things he wished he'd done differently or more ideal versions of his films

02:50.560 --> 02:56.120
He even considered doing a new ending of Magnificent Ambersons 30 years later with the surviving actors

02:56.280 --> 03:00.000
But these truer versions of his films never surfaced

03:00.360 --> 03:06.120
Wells I argue was ahead of his time here what he was yearning to do was make

03:06.640 --> 03:12.440
Directors cuts in the modern era the idea that a film will get a director's cut is almost taken for granted

03:12.840 --> 03:20.440
In fact, it's so widely accepted that the director's cut is the most authentic version of a film that some fans of the DC superhero

03:20.440 --> 03:26.680
movies are asking specifically for a Snyder cut of Justice League under the impression that this would

03:26.920 --> 03:30.760
Inherently be the better version of the film than the version that some other later

03:30.880 --> 03:35.760
Director would have made tens of thousands of dollars have been raised for charities in the process of fans

03:36.080 --> 03:40.560
Demonstrating their desire to Warner Brothers now. I quite like a lot of Zack Snyder's films myself

03:40.800 --> 03:42.880
The first step is admitting have a problem

03:42.880 --> 03:48.100
And I'd love to see his version of Justice League and also unsee the version that Joss Whedon witty

03:48.320 --> 03:50.160
Dialogue to himself all over

03:50.160 --> 03:53.440
But I can't help but notice that we seem to now be living in an age

03:53.640 --> 03:56.360
Where you can't just dislike a film and move on with your life

03:56.480 --> 04:03.160
It's an opportunity to become even more engaged to give even more of your time to something you didn't even like in the hopes of

04:03.160 --> 04:07.520
Getting a newer better version. So how did we get here and

04:08.320 --> 04:15.720
Our directors cuts all that different that much of the time or isn't it somewhat bizarre to expect a director to relive a finished work?

04:15.800 --> 04:20.040
In order to make a slightly better version of something that was already completed and released

04:20.040 --> 04:25.000
And as a director really the main authority on the most ideal version of a work

04:25.680 --> 04:27.360
Let's look at

04:27.360 --> 04:34.160
let's look at some examples of directors cuts and how they're different from the originals and if they're actually that much better and

04:34.640 --> 04:40.600
Just generally go on an adventure of discovery for what all this means for how we think about art in the modern era

04:41.240 --> 04:44.120
That's that's pretty good. Doesn't it? Welcome back to scanline

04:56.000 --> 05:03.560
Put succinctly a director's cut is a version of a motion picture that is edited according to the director's wishes and that usually

05:03.760 --> 05:07.240
Includes scenes cut from the version created for general distribution

05:07.560 --> 05:12.040
Wikipedia says Blade Runner was the first film to ever use the phrasing directors cut in marketing

05:12.040 --> 05:18.780
But but the page doesn't actually cite a source to confirm this. So thanks Wikipedia

05:18.780 --> 05:24.920
It's excellent excellent work there as the questions of creative control grow increasingly culturally pertinent and profitable

05:25.000 --> 05:28.480
It's become more and more common for films to have a second release as a new

05:28.920 --> 05:35.400
alternative version one more in line with the directors original wishes a sort of final cut privilege in retrospect a

05:35.680 --> 05:42.760
Shocking amount of films have directors cuts now, which gives the impression they serve a creative need that goes unsatisfied in the original process

05:42.760 --> 05:48.280
But creative control is more of a vague conceptual idea than a thing whose effects are truly measurable

05:48.280 --> 05:53.280
Let's look at some tangible examples of differences between cuts and why they can be important

05:53.280 --> 05:58.520
We might as well start with Blade Runner since it apparently started all this cite your sources. God damn it

06:01.280 --> 06:02.600
Ridley Scott's

06:02.600 --> 06:07.960
1982 sci-fi dystopian speculative fiction science fiction film blade run everyone knows what Blade Runner is

06:07.960 --> 06:11.720
Why am I explaining Blade Runner is a very good movie? I think I've heard it's good

06:11.720 --> 06:16.520
I've got a copy here in my editing program and I'm skipping through it looking for footage to use and wow, it seems great

06:16.520 --> 06:22.220
It's got flying cars and a cool gun explores complex questions about personhood and what it even means to be human

06:22.460 --> 06:24.460
It's got music. It's good. There's

06:24.940 --> 06:26.940
some eyes in it and

06:26.940 --> 06:32.820
Some eyes here and here this guy loves talking about seeing things with his eyes and then later he tells this guy

06:32.820 --> 06:34.660
But all the stuff he's seen

06:34.660 --> 06:39.740
Whoa, if I didn't know any better, I'd say there's some kind of theme going on here foolish Ridley

06:39.740 --> 06:44.700
Don't you know themes are for book reports get all these images and ideas out of here before you poke someone's eye

06:44.700 --> 06:45.580
Yeah, oh no

06:45.580 --> 06:49.780
I'm doing it the movie had mixed reception upon its release to quote Brian J

06:49.780 --> 06:55.560
Rob's guide to Ridley Scott critical reaction was decidedly mixed the New York Times called it muddled yet

06:55.860 --> 06:59.540
Mesmerizing Time magazine said the film like its setting is a beautiful

06:59.780 --> 07:07.220
Deadly organism that devours life and the Los Angeles Times complained blade crawler might be more like it got him

07:07.220 --> 07:13.620
Oh fuck him up Sheila the film while good had some confusing choices and strange problems

07:13.620 --> 07:15.300
There's a lot of beautifully subtle

07:15.300 --> 07:20.660
Storytelling and world-building where the viewer is given the chance to think for themselves and pick up on what's happening by paying attention

07:20.980 --> 07:26.700
You know the score pal. You're not cop your little people and yet there's this terrible voiceover

07:26.700 --> 07:33.340
And I'd rather be a killer than a victim and that's exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant the voiceover

07:33.540 --> 07:38.860
Explains away everything even remotely subtle and it sounds like Harrison Ford is bored out of his mind

07:39.020 --> 07:44.620
there's a lot of really beautiful storytelling like when Deckard retires a female replicant and

07:44.940 --> 07:48.260
Looking at her body feels genuinely awful about what he's done

07:48.460 --> 07:55.420
The audience can see plainly what hunting down creatures who are effectively human and have done nothing wrong except want to live longer

07:55.740 --> 07:57.300
Has done to him

07:57.300 --> 08:00.740
But then the voiceover comes in just to make sure you know that's happening

08:00.740 --> 08:07.180
Just in case you don't like being trusted to think the report would be routine retirement of a replicant

08:07.180 --> 08:11.300
Which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. Oh

08:12.140 --> 08:14.820
Deckard feels sympathy. I wouldn't have known

08:15.020 --> 08:19.980
It's not like there's an actor in the frame showing me or anything by far. The worst one is legendary

08:20.260 --> 08:23.260
We get this incredible moment of humanity from Roy Batty

08:23.780 --> 08:30.020
Theoretically the antagonist of the movie as his lifespan runs out and he talks about the beauty of all the things he's seen

08:30.060 --> 08:35.420
It's one of the greatest moments in film history. But hey, guess what decides to ruin it?

08:35.420 --> 08:42.060
I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments. He loved life more than he ever had before

08:42.060 --> 08:42.580
Oh

08:42.580 --> 08:45.340
I think that guy likes being alive

08:45.660 --> 08:49.020
Deckard and Rachel prepare to escape together and in a very tense moment

08:49.260 --> 08:53.740
Deckard finds proof gaff has been in his apartment a calling card of his is left in there

08:53.740 --> 08:57.900
then they leave and it's incredibly tense and suspenseful as the doors close and

08:58.060 --> 09:04.740
Then suddenly after all this noirish tension and dystopian storytelling and eternal night and rain and neon BAM

09:05.260 --> 09:07.580
upbeat music bright skies clean air

09:07.900 --> 09:14.500
Deckard and Rachel are taking a nice drive in the woods and that crappy voiceover tells us actually Rachel was a special replicant who doesn't have

09:14.500 --> 09:16.060
a built-in death date

09:16.060 --> 09:20.700
Tyrella told me Rachel was special no termination date. Oh

09:21.300 --> 09:25.420
Sure. Yeah, this ending doesn't feel weird at all in the last 30 seconds of the film

09:25.420 --> 09:30.100
It all turned out to be okay, just a complete whiplash and why is that unicorn there?

09:30.100 --> 09:35.260
So it was fine really good even but clearly flawed soon after its release

09:35.260 --> 09:38.220
There was speculation that the studio had meddled with production

09:38.220 --> 09:45.660
I mean that ending is literally just b-roll borrowed from The Shining a so-called work print of the film not entirely finished version made during

09:45.660 --> 09:52.820
The editing process had been shown to test audiences and was speculated to have been significantly different and then edited down and in the early

09:52.820 --> 09:57.660
90s, it started being shown in a limited theatrical run branded as a director's cut though

09:57.660 --> 10:04.420
Scott had no actual say in this version's release either and publicly disowned this version the work print wasn't a finished version of the film

10:04.420 --> 10:08.940
For example, it was missing the horrendous voiceover, which is obviously a positive thing to miss

10:08.940 --> 10:12.320
There are no closing credits and it just ends on the words the end

10:12.460 --> 10:18.060
But more importantly it doesn't the end with a horrible story ruining tacked on happy ending

10:18.060 --> 10:24.800
It ends in the elevator with Deckard and Rachel with all the horrible feelings of uncertainty and doom that come with not knowing what happens

10:24.800 --> 10:30.600
Next and that Rachel probably doesn't have long to live even if Gaff spared her the unicorn thing is still weird, though

10:30.600 --> 10:35.680
I guess Gaff is just a quirky guy who likes to spare people and do origami to be fair

10:35.680 --> 10:37.160
I'm a pretty big fan of sparing people

10:37.160 --> 10:41.280
I even showed Kurt mercy even though he showed me no gratitude for it

10:41.280 --> 10:45.120
The work print was surprisingly popular and the differences were lauded as positive ones

10:45.280 --> 10:48.880
This caused Warner Brothers to begin work on a proper director's cut

10:49.080 --> 10:56.040
Well, not actually a director's cut someone else was put in charge of doing it and Scott just got to provide notes and consult on it

10:56.040 --> 11:03.160
Warner Brothers seemed to be banking on the idea of releasing a director's cut and all the ideas of creative freedom that

11:03.160 --> 11:09.800
Implied to fans and film buffs but not in actually giving the actual director that actual freedom

11:09.800 --> 11:16.020
The director's cut is so much better than the original when trying to explain what the differences actually are

11:16.180 --> 11:22.100
There aren't exactly that many major changes if you just list them out largely it's about what's not there anymore

11:22.180 --> 11:25.260
There's no voiceovers whatsoever and the happy ending has been removed

11:25.260 --> 11:28.140
It's amazing what bigger difference the lack of voiceover has though

11:28.140 --> 11:33.220
It lets all the actors and performances breathe instead of being told what to think about something

11:33.340 --> 11:38.780
They're simply being shown it and expected to think for themselves and that's really powerful

11:39.620 --> 11:41.620
Hey Shannon

11:42.380 --> 11:44.320
Yeah, okay when you're editing this bit

11:44.320 --> 11:47.460
I want it to slowly digitally zoom on my face

11:47.620 --> 11:51.140
While I get emotional about how good Blade Runner is and you know

11:51.140 --> 11:55.820
We can play like some knockoff tears in rain music. We can get Zoe blade to do it. It'll be great

11:55.820 --> 11:59.700
It'll be really funny reference Harris. I don't I don't think that works in a video essay

12:00.100 --> 12:07.220
Yeah, but I want it and I'm the director. Yeah. Well, I'm doing a lot of the editing and I might not edit it like that

12:08.220 --> 12:15.260
Maybe in the final cut of this video 20 years later, you can finally achieve your dumb vision. Oh, I get it

12:15.260 --> 12:16.260
That's very meta

12:16.260 --> 12:22.580
And I mean honestly he's like speaking as your co-writer the parts of the video that you wrote are full of holes in your research

12:22.820 --> 12:25.700
Like the cockatoo scene in Citizen Kane isn't the first jump scare

12:25.940 --> 12:31.380
It was most likely popularized by cat people in 1942 with the lootin bus. There's a scene with a bus

12:31.380 --> 12:33.820
It's the first ever like well-known jump scare

12:33.820 --> 12:37.660
Yeah, but it's a funny joke in it and we get to explain the cockatoo and that's pretty good

12:37.660 --> 12:41.540
It's a it's a very light-hearted opening. It doesn't have to be completely true. Oh

12:42.500 --> 12:48.820
Now I'm explaining my joke. I spent ages convincing myself. That bit was funny now. It's ruined

12:49.180 --> 12:54.860
By the way, what happened to the footage of me driving to McDonald's for 15 minutes and talking about how much I love tapes for

12:54.860 --> 12:56.860
The last video. Did you just take it out?

12:57.140 --> 13:01.860
Am I gonna have to start a petition to release the Harris cut of the VHS episode of Scanline

13:02.060 --> 13:04.860
Is that really gonna have to happen now? You know what?

13:05.420 --> 13:11.700
Forget it. I'm cutting this whole part out. It interrupts your explanation of the director's cut and honestly, it's a little bit indulgent

13:11.700 --> 13:18.460
What no, you can't do that. My overly indulgent directors intent is being violated. You can't just

13:19.380 --> 13:23.660
But most importantly and I can't stress enough how cool a change this is

13:24.100 --> 13:30.980
Midway through the movie while Deckard plays idly on his piano. He begins to have a dream and he dreams

13:31.740 --> 13:33.540
about a unicorn

13:33.540 --> 13:40.180
Holy shit. I mean, holy shit. What a small simple change and yet the difference is amazing

13:40.180 --> 13:46.700
I mean firstly finally someone in the movie based on the book do androids dream of electric sheep has someone having a dream in it

13:46.700 --> 13:54.340
But more importantly now the origami unicorn gaff leaves behind means something because how could gaff know Deckard's dreams?

13:54.740 --> 14:02.140
This implies that maybe Deckard is also a replicant who believes he's human with implanted dreams and memories. It's still ambiguous

14:02.580 --> 14:09.460
Obviously, I mean maybe gaff also dreams about unicorns humans do don't they this ambiguity to me

14:09.460 --> 14:12.180
At least is the point of the film ultimately

14:12.180 --> 14:17.060
It doesn't matter whether Deckard is a replicant because he would still be equally a person

14:17.260 --> 14:24.300
human in all but name and it's only in this cut many years after its release that this point really gets to be made and

14:24.300 --> 14:28.700
All this stuff is brought up by the simple inclusion of a daydream about a unicorn

14:28.900 --> 14:33.140
It's kind of amazing how much a simple change just a couple of seconds of new footage

14:33.340 --> 14:36.500
Can impact the overall meaning and value of an entire film?

14:36.500 --> 14:40.980
I think this better than anything else in any other film can demonstrate the sheer power

14:41.180 --> 14:45.940
Editing can have on a movie quoting here from Rob's book again ten years later in

14:46.500 --> 14:52.420
1992 with the release of the director's cut the film received the welcome it deserved according to the Washington Post

14:52.700 --> 14:58.140
The film is great on every level the poignant screenplay about a man's futile quest for immortality

14:58.700 --> 15:03.940
Scott's tremendous direction the incredible futuristic sets designed by Lawrence G

15:03.940 --> 15:09.380
Paul Sid Mead and the others the phenomenal special effects and the touching performances

15:09.780 --> 15:13.180
Especially from Hauer a replicant fighting against the ebbing of his life

15:13.300 --> 15:18.220
His swan song is one of the most touching in modern movie history quick aside

15:18.220 --> 15:22.940
Maybe people would have been more willing to recognize his performance if there hadn't been a fucking voiceover right after it

15:22.940 --> 15:27.340
What's interesting about this director's cut though is that it wasn't actually the director's cut

15:27.540 --> 15:33.260
it's ironic that one of the most famous examples of a director's cut is not actually a director's cut and

15:33.500 --> 15:39.580
Studios were already capitalizing on the idea of a director's cut to sell a movie, but we'll get back to that later

15:39.860 --> 15:45.420
15 years later. There was a final cut of Blade Runner, which was made with Scott finally in complete control

15:45.780 --> 15:52.340
It's essentially a version of the director's cut with slightly different editing better effects some changes in color grading

15:52.500 --> 15:56.980
Harrison Ford's son came in to reshoot a few minor things to make mouth movements that fit the ADR

15:56.980 --> 16:01.820
Oh and most importantly the shot of the bird flying away at the end finally matches the rest of the fucking scene

16:01.940 --> 16:04.340
It took 25 years, but we did it everyone

16:04.340 --> 16:06.700
It's not really a necessary version of the film

16:06.700 --> 16:11.260
But it's nice that Scott finally got to make a version he properly had control over

16:11.780 --> 16:14.180
After the success of the director's cut of Blade Runner

16:14.500 --> 16:19.500
Director's cuts became increasingly common the most famous other example of this is also by Ridley Scott

16:19.700 --> 16:23.740
Kingdom of Heaven's original release was very divisive and pretty poorly received overall

16:24.060 --> 16:28.700
Critics and audiences generally found it unsatisfying often boring and lacking in depth

16:28.700 --> 16:34.900
It was so bad that Roger Ebert a film critic from opposite land who says the wrong thing almost all the time because he's a hack

16:35.060 --> 16:38.620
Gave it three and a half stars out of four and said it was better than gladiator

16:39.140 --> 16:44.660
Three and a half stars. I'm not saying Roger Ebert's taste is questionable, but just putting it out there

16:44.660 --> 16:46.660
That's the rating he gave to The Phantom Menace

16:47.180 --> 16:51.820
Okay, actually I take it back Roger Ebert's great people are really uncharitable to The Phantom Menace

16:51.820 --> 16:58.100
It's actually pretty good Kingdom of Heaven then got a director's cut released on DVD with 45 minutes of new material

16:58.100 --> 17:05.300
Which massively expands the story alters the roles of the main characters and turns the film into a genuine masterpiece of historical epicness?

17:05.300 --> 17:10.220
And fleshes out Orlando Bloom's role so much that it transforms into his best ever

17:10.580 --> 17:18.220
Performance and also frankly his only performance there are hundreds of directors cuts now many of which arguably improved the movie

17:18.500 --> 17:21.260
Most of them have much less drastic changes than these

17:21.260 --> 17:27.620
But it's clear that even small changes can make a big difference and as with the final cut even if there's next to no difference

17:27.620 --> 17:34.620
The point is the creator getting to achieve their vision unsullied by previous meddling. That is the point right isn't it?

17:35.220 --> 17:41.620
Well, not all alternative cuts of films exist for this reason artistic intent and creative ambition

17:42.260 --> 17:43.740
Aren't set in stone

17:43.740 --> 17:48.380
Okay time to get personal as a creator who's got a lot of stuff out there that he can't

17:48.580 --> 17:51.900
Meaningfully go back and change without releasing it as a whole new thing

17:52.060 --> 17:55.660
There are tons of things that I would do differently now in retrospect or

17:55.900 --> 18:01.260
Mistakes that I genuinely would love to go back and fix when I make YouTube videos for my own personal channel

18:01.260 --> 18:05.420
I inherently have final cut privilege. No one can tell me what to do

18:05.460 --> 18:10.420
There is no executive producer with any oversight or control and when I work with a sponsor

18:10.420 --> 18:15.580
I tell them I'm not gonna make any changes even if they ask and they just are gonna have to live with what I make

18:15.980 --> 18:17.100
so

18:17.100 --> 18:22.500
Basically, I am at all times free to unleash my unmitigated

18:23.140 --> 18:29.860
Creative vision upon the world, but what if my unmitigated creative vision isn't perfect the first time around?

18:30.060 --> 18:33.860
what if I make genuine mistakes or change my mind or

18:34.660 --> 18:40.260
Couldn't afford to do something or just didn't have the talent to creative the things I

18:40.860 --> 18:41.980
visioned

18:41.980 --> 18:43.740
That's got to be pretty

18:43.740 --> 18:47.380
Unmitigating right there. Most of the time directors cuts for me would be things like

18:48.020 --> 18:53.420
Rerecording voiceover to sound a bit less echoey or a bit less mouth clicky that sound

18:53.420 --> 18:59.460
I hate when I hear myself making that sound it's awful or remove jokes that I realized weren't actually very funny in retrospect or

18:59.660 --> 19:04.420
Worse are actually casually ableist and I just hadn't noticed or fix that time

19:04.420 --> 19:08.580
I accidentally left an arrow at 2% opacity at the top of the screen by accident

19:08.580 --> 19:11.100
So fully fading it out and it's there for half the fucking video

19:11.220 --> 19:15.020
So getting another run at the project isn't always fully about control

19:15.020 --> 19:22.020
It's about making improvements that you feel you could do now and a lot of directors cuts are more in line with this way of thinking

19:22.220 --> 19:27.740
One director is famous for changing his mind about something after releasing a film that he thought was fine at the time and that

19:28.180 --> 19:35.820
Director's name is Paul Thomas Anderson when Magnolia came out it was well-received but considered by some to be a little on the long side

19:36.260 --> 19:40.060
Anderson defended the decisions he made for his film and seemed pretty happy with it

19:40.060 --> 19:46.420
And I was really upfront, you know saying it's gonna be three hours and you know, they were wonderful in saying, okay

19:46.420 --> 19:50.460
We're not gonna tell you what to do. We'd love it if this was shorter, you know

19:50.460 --> 19:52.700
But but so just make it as short as you can

19:52.700 --> 19:58.940
But the interesting thing about time is it makes you rethink your work a little sometimes this movie at this moment

19:58.940 --> 20:04.380
The one that is in the theaters today. Yeah, it's the movie you wanted to make exactly

20:04.580 --> 20:07.460
Is it the movie you set out to me exactly?

20:07.460 --> 20:13.860
But if you were given the opportunity to do another cut of it, oh, I'd slice that thing down

20:15.700 --> 20:20.780
It's way too fucking long good. Oh, no, it's it's it's unmerciful how long it is

20:20.780 --> 20:22.980
No director's cut of Magnolia has been released

20:23.100 --> 20:27.860
But it's useful knowing directors might have made their own films differently with the benefit of hindsight

20:28.300 --> 20:34.060
Even when they defended them at the time Sam Raimi had complete control over Evil Dead his first film to the point

20:34.060 --> 20:39.220
He places the failure of his next film Crime Wave on there being too much oversight compared to Evil Dead

20:39.220 --> 20:45.980
They replaced my actors. They threw Bruce Campbell out of the lead. They threw out my musician Joe LaDuca

20:46.180 --> 20:52.260
They recut the picture. They had their own say with the sound effects and mix they

20:53.380 --> 20:58.900
Did everything they could to make it what it is today. Do you see Crime Wave?

20:58.940 --> 21:00.940
I

21:00.980 --> 21:03.860
Saw that movie on an airplane and people still walked out

21:05.180 --> 21:11.300
Edie was independently financed largely by whoever Raimi and his friends could get to give them money so they could do whatever they wanted

21:11.300 --> 21:16.100
We didn't have nearly the freedom as our first film because investors aren't gonna come on the set

21:16.260 --> 21:19.340
Dennis isn't gonna say are you sure that camera angles, right?

21:19.340 --> 21:24.820
But this freedom doesn't mean Raimi was necessarily going to be happy forever with all aspects of the film he made

21:25.020 --> 21:29.580
There's a controversial segment in the film where a woman is sexually assaulted by demonic trees

21:29.660 --> 21:33.660
the scene is far more gruesome than anything else in the film and it's definitely a

21:33.740 --> 21:39.280
Contributing factor to it being regarded as one of the video nasties in the UK and getting an NC-17 in the US

21:39.340 --> 21:44.660
Plus it was banned in other countries with different releases subject to various different cuts over the years in

21:45.140 --> 21:48.740
Retrospect Raimi isn't happy with that scene and talks about this openly

21:48.740 --> 21:54.340
well, I think it was unnecessarily gratuitous and a little too brutal and I finally because

21:54.820 --> 22:01.780
People were offended in a way that I did. My goal is not to offend people. It is to entertain thrill scare

22:03.140 --> 22:05.300
Make them laugh but not to offend them

22:05.900 --> 22:08.500
Regret putting it in I do I do

22:09.060 --> 22:14.700
Piers Haggard felt precisely the same way about his folk horror film the blood on Satan's claw the rape scene now

22:15.260 --> 22:20.780
I think it's probably too strong and it's interesting that I wasn't bothered at the time. I think you

22:21.660 --> 22:23.660
Will find most directors

22:24.300 --> 22:28.460
If they get their teeth into a sequence, which is going to be really powerful

22:29.140 --> 22:34.060
They become completely seduced and I was seduced by the sheer dramatic power

22:34.260 --> 22:37.660
Directors have these kinds of regrets or change their minds about stuff all the time

22:37.860 --> 22:42.860
Although of course no studio has helped them re-release these films with the sexual assaults cut

22:42.860 --> 22:48.820
I guess adding in more unicorns is more important than ameliorating excessive sexual violence on film

22:48.820 --> 22:52.060
Some directors actually do get to make their ideal changes though

22:52.060 --> 22:57.140
The Coen brothers who did some work on the editing of Evil Dead and later worked closely with Raimi on other projects

22:57.140 --> 23:02.980
Got to do a director's cut of blood simple despite also being in charge of the original cut blood simple is awesome

23:02.980 --> 23:07.220
It's very different from the rest of their films, but not tangibly worse just different

23:07.220 --> 23:12.740
It's a very stripped down thriller. The director's cut is even more streamlined. It's about three minutes shorter

23:12.820 --> 23:17.020
No scenes have been outright cut but a lot of shots have been trimmed down in length

23:17.020 --> 23:20.580
So the feel is much tighter. These changes are very small

23:20.620 --> 23:24.020
The director's cut is arguably tighter and better edited

23:24.180 --> 23:29.020
But also not different enough that I don't think anyone who didn't like it would like it that much more

23:29.020 --> 23:34.060
And I don't think anyone who really likes the movie thinks that much better of it because of this version either

23:34.060 --> 23:37.940
I'm reminded here of Orson Welles complaining about hysterical tinkering

23:37.980 --> 23:42.540
What exactly was the purpose of all this? The film is theoretically better

23:42.540 --> 23:50.300
But I find it strange that people would go back to create a slightly better version of something that already existed and was fine

23:50.300 --> 23:54.140
Now I love the Coen brothers as much as the next pretentious white nerd boy

23:54.140 --> 23:58.260
But frankly if there's any evidence that director's cuts are actually a bad idea

23:58.300 --> 24:06.700
This is exhibit a aren't mistakes something we ought to accept rather than hope to eventually see slightly touched up later in one

24:06.700 --> 24:10.660
Of the many documentaries about Blade Runner one called all our variant futures

24:10.660 --> 24:14.660
A lot of attention is paid to all the mistakes being fixed in the final cut

24:14.660 --> 24:17.940
But a lot is also made of the charm of some of the mistakes

24:18.180 --> 24:24.100
Gaff's eye color changing things like that and it's clear a lot of thought went into when one mistake is something to be

24:24.140 --> 24:28.500
Corrected to improve the quality of the work and when other mistakes bring their own

24:28.620 --> 24:34.060
Character to the film and ought to be left alone aren't all these mistakes part of the film though

24:34.300 --> 24:36.420
Should an artist be allowed to

24:36.980 --> 24:43.260
Perpetually alter their work once it's been handed over to the public in a 1993 article in the journal film comment

24:43.420 --> 24:50.900
Film scholar and critic Greg Solomon wrote uncertain glory directors cut editions the redemption of an art or the first step on a slippery slope

24:51.340 --> 24:56.500
He said viewing film art as perpetually subject to update and correction

24:56.660 --> 25:01.220
Political or other says something about the directors relationship to their work in a way

25:01.300 --> 25:09.340
They redress artistic grievances by treating movies as mere product in this country and an alienable right to change as an

25:09.340 --> 25:11.700
artist doesn't extend to changing art and

25:12.380 --> 25:20.540
therefore art history rather than artistic deliverance the DC trend represents a significant disturbance of film history and

25:21.220 --> 25:27.300
Equally important the popular cultural memory of the original audiences even kitsch merits protection

25:27.300 --> 25:32.380
The directors cut means the practical elimination of a film record and that the market

25:32.700 --> 25:38.660
Valorizes the new to the point that it supplants the old version and despite what the misnomer directors cut implies

25:38.860 --> 25:42.380
This movement augurs poorly for the rise of the Hollywood auteur

25:42.420 --> 25:47.740
There's certainly no amelioration of the compromise between strict studio and enterprising director

25:48.140 --> 25:55.500
Essential to evaluating their personal commitment to circumvention of studio Philistines in the end the same old commerce here

25:55.700 --> 26:01.220
Masquerades as the aesthetics of creative freedom the ending to his piece is appropriately dramatic

26:01.340 --> 26:08.060
Our film culture faces a future in which old movies will not just seem different from how we remembered them

26:08.060 --> 26:12.700
They will be the theatrical release is fast becoming a work in progress

26:13.340 --> 26:17.480
Original versions soon will exist only in the fragments of our collective memory

26:17.820 --> 26:22.640
Then to quote the authority all those moments will be lost in time

26:23.300 --> 26:25.300
like tears in

26:25.340 --> 26:32.740
Rain in a much more recent piece Alex roses or tears gone wild why the directors cut often turns into an axe murder in the American

26:32.740 --> 26:36.960
Scholar from 2010 Rose says directors couldn't leave well enough alone

26:36.960 --> 26:44.940
They redressed their early classics in ever gaudier clothing and attempts to reclaim their youthful eminence since corrupted by years of compromise

26:45.700 --> 26:52.020
Rose calls directors cuts an indulgence saying even the subtleties while peripheral and seemingly innocuous

26:52.340 --> 26:58.820
Have their effects an extra cutaway here a quick reaction shot there and suddenly the gags aren't quite as funny

26:58.820 --> 27:03.420
The sex scenes aren't as breathless the fights lose their drive the dialogue drags

27:03.660 --> 27:09.700
Just a little more padding and primping and the intangible gestalt of the original is lost

27:10.220 --> 27:15.380
Indulgence is a death sentence a reliable antidote. However is the adoption of

27:15.980 --> 27:20.620
Constraints and what other medium would colossal vanity be permitted much less encouraged

27:21.220 --> 27:27.660
Solman says typically the commercially successful rather than the artistically worthy enjoys studio benevolence

27:27.940 --> 27:32.860
Same as it ever was in a reader's response section in a film comment from later in the year

27:33.060 --> 27:36.460
Gordon Hale from Philadelphia has a prescient comment on Solman's piece

27:36.460 --> 27:42.820
He describes Tom Richardson re-editing Tom Jones then says as films grow older and their copyrights expire

27:43.180 --> 27:49.140
Both the artists and the moneymen will have the same incentive to prepare new editions

27:49.340 --> 27:54.540
Qualifying for new copyrights original versions will then be withdrawn completely new improved

27:54.900 --> 28:02.740
Editions will abound just like toothpaste and detergent and the example Solomon cites will seem like a drop in the bucket

28:03.500 --> 28:08.740
So even though I like blood simple, I really quite like that. There is a director's cut of blood simple

28:08.740 --> 28:13.740
I love the Coen brothers and I'm glad that they have the power to go back and do that if they want

28:14.020 --> 28:19.740
It still manages to pose a lot of difficult questions about how much power a director should have over their art and

28:19.900 --> 28:26.460
Whether or not directors cuts are actually as anti-commercial as they seem to be. Maybe there's a certain confidence or

28:26.900 --> 28:29.740
Honesty in not going back and making changes

28:29.980 --> 28:35.900
Anderson and Ramey have criticisms of their old films as anyone who gets years to look back on their work ought to do

28:35.900 --> 28:41.860
But they aren't going back and making changes to things that are already a part of history in order to satisfy those criticisms

28:42.100 --> 28:46.100
It's okay to learn and move on for things to not be perfect

28:46.100 --> 28:49.940
it may well be that the ability to go back and change something if you want to

28:50.300 --> 28:55.020
Poses just as much of a threat to the integrity of art as any meddling studio

28:55.340 --> 28:58.740
Sometimes the directors changes don't just not make the film any better

28:58.900 --> 29:05.620
But they actively make it worse and what director's name springs to mind better than Francis Ford Coppola

29:05.940 --> 29:11.060
Apocalypse now is a really good film and it better be because it took forever to make and would have destroyed Coppola's

29:11.380 --> 29:12.540
Coppola's

29:12.540 --> 29:18.660
Coppola's career if it hadn't but it was good. So it meant Coppola kept his career and was free to go on to make

29:21.820 --> 29:26.500
Apocalypse now is a really good film but in a very interesting way at nearly two and a half hours

29:26.500 --> 29:27.380
It's pretty long

29:27.380 --> 29:33.460
But the pacing of the movie is so good all the scenes flow so perfectly and the dreamlike

29:33.460 --> 29:39.940
Descent into madness is so well-defined that it's pleasant to sit through you kind of slip into it

29:39.940 --> 29:44.140
It doesn't feel its length at all. If you showed me the movie and told me it was 90 minutes

29:44.140 --> 29:48.860
I would probably believe you in 2001 Coppola released apocalypse now Redux

29:49.660 --> 29:57.980
Redux Redux Redux an extended cut with reworked editing and more scenes added in this new version is three hours and 22 minutes

29:58.300 --> 30:04.260
More content squeezed out of the content tube onto the conveyor belt of cinema. Yes, please

30:04.940 --> 30:08.540
apocalypse now good film great film arguably a

30:09.060 --> 30:10.700
masterpiece

30:10.700 --> 30:12.700
apocalypse now Redux

30:12.940 --> 30:19.060
Garbage the whole thing is fucking terrible. He ruined it. I hate you so much Francis

30:22.380 --> 30:27.220
When you shoot over a million feet of footage to make your masterpiece

30:27.220 --> 30:29.060
Which yeah, I guess is an achievement

30:29.060 --> 30:35.260
It turns out that most of that footage is piss and you probably shouldn't put all of it in the film

30:35.300 --> 30:40.700
The additional scenes utterly destroy the pacing of the original so while it's technically only

30:41.580 --> 30:45.060
Almost an hour longer. It feels five hours longer

30:45.140 --> 30:48.540
I've seen the Redux version twice and both times

30:48.540 --> 30:53.780
I had to pause and do something else for a while like take a nap or watch a different better film

30:53.940 --> 30:57.220
The long-ass plantation scene adds so little to the film

30:57.220 --> 31:02.820
It effectively takes away from it by distracting from what the film had successfully focused on more by being shorter

31:02.820 --> 31:07.420
Just because some of the stuff in a film is good doesn't mean you can put an entire kitchen. Oh fuck

31:08.420 --> 31:15.380
All the tiny scenes of humor or light-hearted escapes from the darkness are washed away by the sheer scope of the thing

31:15.380 --> 31:20.620
It just keeps on going and it's boring and drags to the point of being actively painful

31:20.620 --> 31:24.500
Ha I slapped my meat too hard against the walls of my set

31:25.260 --> 31:27.140
They're all hurting now

31:27.140 --> 31:31.540
Luckily since it turns out that directors intent is a super malleable concept

31:31.540 --> 31:37.140
It appears that Coppola has changed his mind yet again about what his film is supposed to be this year for the 40th anniversary

31:37.580 --> 31:40.180
He's releasing the apocalypse now final cut

31:40.620 --> 31:45.980
Directors cut number three at this point, which is actually 20 minutes shorter than the Redux version

31:45.980 --> 31:52.260
I'm curious if this version of the film manages to maintain the amazing feel of the original but honestly, I doubt it

31:52.780 --> 31:59.060
Coppola already made a really good version of his film 40 years ago. He had his final cut take it away from him now

31:59.060 --> 32:02.980
He's done. It was fine. I haven't seen this version of the film because I don't

32:03.500 --> 32:07.300
Care, but it is coming to a theater right next to me in September

32:07.300 --> 32:12.420
So I basically have no choice to eventually see it and in the director's cut of this video. I will

32:12.980 --> 32:16.820
Put my impressions of the film here and let you know what I thought of it

32:17.740 --> 32:20.500
And that video will come out in 20 years

32:21.500 --> 32:23.740
Or when I hit a million subscribers

32:24.700 --> 32:26.700
Whichever comes first

32:29.660 --> 32:31.980
Incidentally years ago when I was talking to one of my many

32:32.580 --> 32:37.540
Pretentious film friends who I secretly hate I studied documentary production at uni you run into these people

32:37.540 --> 32:41.380
It's an occupational hazard and I was explaining to her how much I hated apocalypse now Redux

32:41.380 --> 32:44.740
But then she asked me have you heard about the work print?

32:45.140 --> 32:50.220
She then went on to explain that there is a leaked work print of the movie, which is five hours

32:50.820 --> 32:54.260
Long the ten minute long song the end by the doors

32:54.740 --> 32:58.540
Plays in its entirety in the opening in this version of the film

32:58.820 --> 33:02.860
What were they thinking was the intent to make a film that long at some point?

33:03.140 --> 33:08.020
Did they think people would watch it were they developing an experimental new torture device?

33:08.820 --> 33:13.700
Don't watch it even if you can find it leaked online somewhere. Just don't watch it

33:13.700 --> 33:21.860
It's not worth stealing this draft of apocalypse now much like the actual draft is something that you're morally obliged to dodge

33:22.140 --> 33:27.820
So here's an even more evolved version of the blood simple problem directors are going back and re-re-editing

33:28.100 --> 33:32.740
Their films to try to undo some of the damage they did in the first re-edit

33:32.740 --> 33:39.380
The slippery slope was real and one of the best directors ever is actively tumbling down it right now

33:40.020 --> 33:42.500
Hysterically tinkering with his film again

33:42.620 --> 33:48.820
But there's actually an even more egregious example of a director making a silly edit to their film and everyone wanting the original back

33:49.420 --> 33:53.580
That's right. You all knew it was coming. I'm talking about Steven Spielberg

33:54.140 --> 33:59.620
ET the extraterrestrial is a pretty good movie, but 20 years later Spielberg decided some changes were necessary

34:00.060 --> 34:06.740
The kids in this scene are in way too much danger look some of those cops have guns well now in this version

34:06.740 --> 34:08.100
They have walkie-talkies

34:08.100 --> 34:13.980
Phew now the kids are never in any danger as they fly hundreds of feet in the air on fucking bicycles

34:13.980 --> 34:20.140
It appears that even Steven has gone on to regret this decision or at the very least makes sure the original is still available

34:20.580 --> 34:25.460
So this is an example of a director deciding they want something changed going to great

34:25.820 --> 34:29.540
Technological lengths to get it changed and then having second thoughts

34:29.820 --> 34:34.140
This whole directorial freedom to go back and change your films as important thing is

34:34.500 --> 34:40.900
Starting to look a little bit flimsy in the face of directors making changes that they then decide were bad

34:41.300 --> 34:46.340
There's probably an example of a director being even worse than this, but whoa whoops. Oh look

34:46.340 --> 34:49.180
We're out of time for this episode of scan

34:50.180 --> 34:51.900
fine

34:51.900 --> 34:53.900
We all want to talk about him

34:54.020 --> 35:01.540
It's time to talk about Federico Fellini fine George Lucas George Lucas is amazing and revolutionary science fiction film

35:02.060 --> 35:09.620
THX 1138 is an ass-kickingly depressing and bizarre prediction of the future that makes some really incisive comments about modern consumerism

35:10.140 --> 35:17.180
Characters literally buy weird plastic shapes just for the joy of having purchased something then throw them in the trash in

35:18.140 --> 35:24.340
1977 George Lucas predicted Funko pop the original theatrical version had five minutes taken out against Lucas's wishes

35:24.620 --> 35:27.900
After the success of a couple of above-average fantasy films

35:27.900 --> 35:32.740
He made a bit later Lucas got to release a restored version with that footage added back in which is nice

35:32.740 --> 35:34.900
He got his movie back in line with his vision

35:34.900 --> 35:40.540
But then George started deciding that his films couldn't just be brought into accordance with his original vision

35:40.820 --> 35:42.980
No, they could be retrospectively

35:43.740 --> 35:44.940
improved

35:44.940 --> 35:51.980
I'm sure you all know about this already, but in 2004 George Lucas released the director's cut of

35:52.660 --> 35:58.900
THX 1138 I'm doing another fake out this director's cut adds a bunch of CGI and some new shots and effects

35:58.900 --> 36:01.180
It's two minutes longer, and it's just kind of needless

36:01.460 --> 36:05.260
It's nice that his film got to be properly mastered and restored I guess

36:05.420 --> 36:09.980
But the level of meddling with a thing that was really finished decades prior is unnecessary

36:10.020 --> 36:14.500
The film doesn't need some more CGI scenes added in years later

36:14.580 --> 36:19.900
It was already great if an old thing has flaws or isn't perfect or you change your mind about it

36:20.340 --> 36:24.540
Sometimes it's okay to let it go. Well that about wraps it up for this episode of

36:24.900 --> 36:26.900
GEORGE

36:29.460 --> 36:30.700
George

36:30.700 --> 36:32.700
Mr.. Lucas, I

36:32.860 --> 36:37.220
Love your films. I love you as a person. I love you as a thinker

36:37.220 --> 36:41.300
I think you're an amazing man and Star Wars is an absolute blessing

36:41.300 --> 36:47.300
I love all of them even the prequels have some great stuff in there my contract with Shannon obliges me not to defend the

36:47.300 --> 36:51.260
Prequels too hard in a video attached to her name, but you know how I feel

36:51.940 --> 36:54.980
You've read my emails, but come on

36:56.020 --> 36:57.620
What were you doing?

36:57.620 --> 37:03.260
did we really need hand to be marginally less of a scoundrel by making him shoot second and

37:03.700 --> 37:09.420
Then did we really need him to shoot second while also awkwardly CGI dodging a close-range laser blast

37:09.860 --> 37:13.980
Did we really need R2 to be hidden slightly more behind the rocks?

37:14.300 --> 37:19.420
Making it a little more believable that he couldn't be seen but making us wonder how we even got in there

37:19.420 --> 37:25.260
Did we really need to remove a cool scene from Return of the Jedi just to show off the amazing new CGI?

37:25.260 --> 37:29.700
You could do now did we need this this part looks better on VHS by the way

37:29.700 --> 37:32.700
I wonder if someone has done a video about why that would be but come on, bro

37:33.220 --> 37:36.340
Even you think the hand stuff is silly now George

37:36.340 --> 37:39.420
I loved your work genuinely and completely

37:39.580 --> 37:45.300
But it's on you that it's such a hassle to see the original unedited versions people saw and loved in the theater

37:45.300 --> 37:49.220
And that's just not fair even if those versions don't line up with your vision

37:49.820 --> 37:53.020
Spielberg did the right thing making sure the versions people loved are still available

37:53.580 --> 37:59.460
Because movies don't just belong to directors to their supposed auteurs. They also belong to culture

37:59.460 --> 38:03.700
You can have your version of the movie, but the people ought to have theirs

38:03.700 --> 38:07.700
I genuinely find you and your work hugely inspirational

38:07.900 --> 38:13.260
But the way access to the originals was deliberately obscured by you was really disappointing

38:13.780 --> 38:21.660
All these different kinds of directors cut with differing resulting effects, well, they really complicate all this don't they?

38:23.500 --> 38:27.420
So yeah studios mess with films often irrevocably

38:27.740 --> 38:32.660
It's nice that sometimes an unmessed version can manifest but the problem is

38:33.260 --> 38:36.820
Artists and audiences have been enamored with the concept of this

38:37.500 --> 38:39.780
Directors run the risk of falling down a rabbit hole

38:40.460 --> 38:45.020
Continuously re-editing their work once it's already out like it's in early access or something

38:45.260 --> 38:52.700
Changing their minds about what their own visions even were and sometimes even helping to obscure the versions people know and love from history

38:53.180 --> 38:57.300
Worse than this what makes a director an authority on what the film should be?

38:57.900 --> 39:02.900
Directors are a small part of a project the producers writers editors actors

39:03.380 --> 39:08.020
Artists set designers all these people are so important and valuable on any project

39:08.300 --> 39:14.260
That it seems almost rude to pretend the director is the one who should decide what the film they all made is

39:14.420 --> 39:20.220
It takes a village to raise a child and the mayor of the village shouldn't get to say that child belongs to them

39:20.220 --> 39:22.580
This problem hits me on a personal level

39:22.580 --> 39:28.300
In fact, the last scanline video did surprisingly well and made it into some lists of best video essays

39:28.540 --> 39:34.620
But often it was credited directly to me when scanline is a collaborative show between me and Shannon Strucci

39:34.820 --> 39:41.900
Whose name was above mine in the credits we share writing editing and other creative duties. She's editing this part right now

39:41.900 --> 39:48.340
I'm just doing the voiceover. It's really nice that we got recognized for our work, but it's our work not mine

39:48.540 --> 39:55.340
I'm not trying to call anyone out here, but being credited for work. That wasn't simply mine makes me a little uncomfortable

39:55.860 --> 40:01.380
It's an easy mistake to make the video is posted on my channel where most of the videos are purely my work

40:01.380 --> 40:07.980
But I think this misunderstanding is also an extension of how we relate to art right now as products of central

40:08.180 --> 40:14.700
Individuals and not the many other people who work on something or the surrounding situation that led to it on that note

40:14.700 --> 40:20.140
I think what people like is the idea constructed by the concept of directors cuts

40:20.420 --> 40:28.100
We like to imagine films as a struggle between true creators and the false moneymen as a battle to realize

40:28.340 --> 40:33.100
Someone's vision. It's a compelling narrative and maybe it's a little true

40:33.100 --> 40:40.420
The idea that there's an authentic version of a film is kind of beautiful and that makes the struggle to try and get that version

40:40.700 --> 40:42.220
Seem almost romantic

40:42.220 --> 40:49.360
But this narrative has been repackaged and sold back to us in the form of special editions of Terminator 2 with a couple more

40:49.360 --> 40:53.600
Scenes and box sets of every version of Blade Runner for us to compare and contrast

40:54.200 --> 40:59.360
Think about that Warner Brothers are responsible for the theatrical cut and here they are

40:59.800 --> 41:03.760
Selling us the fixed version of a film that was broken by them

41:04.240 --> 41:07.040
We like to think of works as made by one person

41:07.680 --> 41:09.400
products of their own vision

41:09.400 --> 41:14.600
When nothing is that simple the tears in rain monologue the best part of Blade Runner by far

41:14.960 --> 41:16.560
Wasn't made by Ridley Scott

41:16.560 --> 41:19.120
It wasn't even written by the writer not completely

41:19.520 --> 41:26.200
Rutger Hauer modified the monologue the night before making it shorter and feel more human and added the most famous line

41:26.640 --> 41:31.920
And then you know I came up with the line all those moments will be lost in time like tears and rain

41:34.040 --> 41:38.680
Knowing this the idea that it's all up to some sole creator and their mystical intent

41:38.960 --> 41:44.280
Only obscures the reality of filmmaking and trains us to desire a purity of vision

41:44.280 --> 41:46.000
That's completely unattainable

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
Makes us go out and buy more products for the joy of obtaining an even more perfected version of one person's idea

41:53.160 --> 41:56.280
even if that idea was bad and keeps changing even

41:56.720 --> 41:58.800
necessitating more versions and then

41:59.560 --> 42:04.160
Unbroken versions so that you still have the original and it just goes on and on forever

42:04.720 --> 42:11.640
When does the consumption end and the art begin there are no easy answers to questions about art the best

42:11.640 --> 42:13.320
I can muster right now is

42:13.320 --> 42:18.520
Directors cuts are certainly a valid idea and they can arguably improve the quality of a film

42:19.000 --> 42:25.720
But this idea is also easily co-opted into the exact same commercialism that necessitated them in the first place

42:25.920 --> 42:33.080
The idea that the director is the one person who should have final say on the most ideal version of a work is a highly

42:33.400 --> 42:38.880
Ideological assumption which says more about how we think about film than it actually says about the medium itself

42:38.960 --> 42:41.880
But that's a whole can of worms that we'll have to get into at a later date

42:41.880 --> 42:44.240
I guess at some point we should maybe explore what

42:44.840 --> 42:50.680
Authorship actually is and whether the author is alive or not and what the hell or term means

42:51.480 --> 42:55.000
Join us on the next scanline when we discuss how meaning is constructed. Oh

42:55.800 --> 42:58.640
Great. I'm gonna have to read books

42:59.120 --> 43:05.120
But if anything what all this examination of cuts seems to relate is the power of editing

43:05.120 --> 43:11.320
we've seen just how much very small changes can affect the feel of a whole sequence or the meaning of a story an

43:11.520 --> 43:14.800
Editor can make a bad film great and a really good film

43:15.080 --> 43:16.480
terrible and boring

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
Editing is such an important part of the process

43:18.560 --> 43:23.720
That some people spend years of their lives or an awful lot of money learning how to do it too much money

43:23.720 --> 43:28.760
Frankly, luckily we here at scanline have put together a functioning simulation of a film school

43:28.960 --> 43:36.960
Hi Shannon here this cut here where the sound starts first is a great technique for drawing people into your film to do it

43:36.960 --> 43:42.400
You just you you you just have the audio start first. See it's under the video on the timeline

43:42.400 --> 43:46.360
So it looks like a J. It's called a J cut J. That's how you do a J cut. Okay. Thank you

43:46.360 --> 43:48.160
That's film school. That'll be

43:48.880 --> 43:55.600
If only there was a cheaper way to get someone to share the skills required to learn editing

43:57.000 --> 44:00.760
Well, wait, hang on Skillshare is an online learning platform for creators

44:00.760 --> 44:02.280
If you want to learn how to be an editor

44:02.280 --> 44:08.560
Don't do what I did and try to teach yourself for ten years fellow youtuber Jordi van der putt has a class on editing in

44:08.560 --> 44:15.760
Adobe Premiere that takes three hours and 22 minutes the exact length of apocalypse now Redux and a much better use of your time

44:15.960 --> 44:19.720
Jordi's cutting animating and color correcting tips are like the decade

44:19.720 --> 44:24.120
I spent teaching it to myself only in fast-forward and actually taught me a couple new things

44:24.120 --> 44:25.920
I hadn't realized you could do so easily

44:25.920 --> 44:28.760
I'm a little embarrassed about that and better yet

44:28.760 --> 44:34.800
It didn't cost an entire college tuition an annual subscription to the entire platform is less than $10 a month

44:34.880 --> 44:38.040
But if you click on the link in the description or go to skl.sh

44:38.840 --> 44:43.340
Slash hbomberguy you can get two months of free access to these classes and over

44:43.780 --> 44:50.520
25,000 more I talked about time management skills in a video a couple months ago and on that note Thomas Frank's productivity master class

44:50.700 --> 44:54.660
Genuinely improved my life in measurable ways. Hold on. Do you hear this?

44:56.740 --> 44:59.700
That's my filing cabinet, which I have now

44:59.700 --> 45:05.580
I used to keep all the invoices for music and art and stuff in a big pile in the corner and leave to-do lists

45:05.580 --> 45:07.580
everywhere and now I have a system that actually

45:07.660 --> 45:12.260
Works and getting things done is much less daunting if stuff like that might be of interest to you

45:12.260 --> 45:14.260
once again, that link is

45:14.780 --> 45:16.780
skl.sh

45:17.700 --> 45:19.220
Slash hbomberguy

45:19.220 --> 45:21.220
So yeah director's cuts can be good

45:21.820 --> 45:23.660
Often they aren't Francis

45:23.660 --> 45:27.820
But on the whole it's clear why this is an aspect of film worth focusing on

45:27.900 --> 45:31.900
Because as we've seen films really can be greatly altered by even tiny

45:32.180 --> 45:39.500
Removals or additions cinema is often as much in here as it is on the screen. But what we see on the screen with our

45:40.020 --> 45:41.420
eyes

45:41.420 --> 45:47.420
Facilitates our emotions and beliefs and imaginations our collective reverence for alternative cuts

45:47.900 --> 45:54.540
Reveals our understanding of the power films hold over us by learning just how differently the same idea can be expressed

45:54.860 --> 45:57.020
We're learning more about how to express ourselves

45:58.180 --> 46:00.180
Cinema is a powerful thing

46:00.460 --> 46:07.720
Because it is an extension of the human soul. I've seen things that you people would believe because you've seen them, too

46:08.420 --> 46:10.860
I've seen the addition of a daydream

46:11.460 --> 46:19.020
Change how I feel about personhood and my entire understanding of a story. I've seen the addition of more things to something I like

46:19.580 --> 46:23.420
Transform it into something I hate and I've seen thousands of people

46:23.820 --> 46:29.580
Criticize a few scant frames of digital puppeteering because the original meant so much to them

46:29.580 --> 46:36.700
And I'm glad that none of these moments will ever truly be lost because we have the power to share them with each other

46:37.700 --> 46:44.700
Thank you for watching and that's when I realized that this guy might like

46:45.460 --> 46:47.460
movies

47:06.700 --> 47:08.700
I

47:36.700 --> 47:38.700
I

48:06.700 --> 48:08.700
I

48:37.500 --> 48:39.500
I

48:39.860 --> 48:44.420
Know this video is dedicated to the memory of Rutger Hauer who passed away this year

48:45.380 --> 48:51.060
Incidentally 2019 is also the year in which Blade Runner was set. I find myself wondering

48:51.780 --> 48:54.100
Which 2019 I'd rather live in

48:54.740 --> 48:59.260
But frankly in both there are plenty of people who aren't being treated with the personhood they deserve

49:00.940 --> 49:02.940
Go do something nice for someone today
