1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm seeing the accusation of virtue signaling going around a lot lately.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,800
No, they're not criticizing their skill at the rare Dreamcast Lighthouse escape game

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Virtua Signal.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,360
They're actually judging them as people.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,600
In fact, one rational, level-headed individual directly called me out for it in a long rant

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,800
where he gets my name wrong.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,600
Virtue signaling is the latest in a long line of hastily propagated, alt-right, near-reactionary

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,880
buzzwords, including cuck, sgeez, anti-GG, or everyone who thinks harassment is bad,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,200
literally who if you're one of the prime targets, betas, feminazis, white knights,

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,600
spanglers, a phrase on the up-and-up in the community, get ready to be called one of those

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,880
on Twitter in the near future, and of course, cultural Marxists.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,520
Oh, sorry, does that phrase have really bad implications?

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
Shit, we'd better come up with a new word that means the exact same bad idea.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Wha-?

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Uh, regressive leftists?

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,160
There, that'll do.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,040
The term was originally coined by James Bartholomew for The Spectator, to decry people who say

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,120
I don't like this thing very much, in order to feel good about themselves, and then just

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,400
vote Labour every few years or whatever, and take no stake in actually making things better.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,120
This is a fairly straightforwardly good call to action.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,160
The term actually decried a real, existing problem.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,880
Of course, then the idiots got their hands on it.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,640
When interpreted poorly, almost every belief, statement, or piece of writing becomes virtue

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,280
signalling, an attempt to look good for thinking the right thing.

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,360
What's that?

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
You like reading books?

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,600
You're just trying to look like you do a lot of reading to look smart, you virtue signaller.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
What's this?

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,160
You tweet pictures of Kamen Rider figurines in silly and compromising poses?

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,520
You're just trying to signal that you own cool toys and have good photography ability.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
Get out of here.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Oh, what's that?

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,400
You criticize me when I say racist or sexist things, or have bizarre fixations with one

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
particular woman?

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,520
Clearly, you just want to make yourself look enlightened, and like a vaguely good person

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,360
so people will think you're nice, and, I don't know, sleep with you?

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,160
This goes hand in hand with another popular term, the white knight.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,520
White knights are traditionally people who defend women on the internet out of the misguided

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,680
belief it will result in some kind of reward, usually sex, which sounds difficult to do

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,520
over the internet, but who knew apparently the best way to get it is to be nice to people?

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
As someone who frequently impersonates a woman in online games, I can confirm that white

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,240
knights do actually exist, and they are really weird, but we've reached a point where any

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,520
male person defending any female person for any reason nets an accusation of just wanting

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,720
them to pull their dipstick, because why else would anyone side with a woman, right?

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,280
It's not like you can just, you know, think they're right about something.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,480
Women's rights activists and pick-up artists love to decry criticism as virtue signaling,

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,480
but not because they're against the idea that it's wrong to say and do things for

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
sex.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,520
In fact, people have built careers on telling these groups exactly what to say and do in

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,640
order to get someone to sleep with you, so their problem with virtue signaling can't

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,520
be that it's wrong to say what you think will get you laid.

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,640
Their problem appears to be that they view it as an ineffective fuckstrat, and of course,

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,640
To bring the whole thing back on itself like a bulging, veiny Ouroboros, whenever they're

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,640
tasked with formulating their own beliefs in detail, they invariably end up appealing

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
to things like classical virtue.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,480
You know, those things put forward by someone, at some point in history, interpreted by me.

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,000
Look at this statue.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,120
Clearly this means the Greeks were afraid of homosexuality and thought it should be

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
repressed.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,960
Pay no attention to actual historical fact.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,040
You only look at the facts because you want to look smart.

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
You know, the Greeks, the famously straight people.

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,320
And when they're not accusing them of trying to get people to sleep with them, they're

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,720
accusing them of being gay.

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,200
I would just like to take a moment to point out that we've reached a situation where

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,500
to some people, being gay and wanting to have sex with women are interchangeable.

67
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,440
This eradication of a term's meaning is part of a deeper problem with internet culture.

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
It's the same with the word cuck.

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,960
A few years ago, cuckoldry was a fetish where one spouse engages in sex with another person

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,480
to emasculate their partner.

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,440
Now the word is just another one-size-fits-all disparagement to use against people who you

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
don't like.

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,720
You can say what you like about chanboards, but at the very least they're incredibly

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,720
effective at rendering words meaningless.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,080
Instead of having to defend your point of view, which could be really difficult, you

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,640
can just ignore them and dance around accusing them of trying to look like they're good

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
people.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,880
It's a fantastic defense mechanism, except for the part where it isn't very good at

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
all.

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
Let's give the three main reasons why.

81
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Firstly, let's say the person you're arguing with really does think they're making themselves

82
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,640
look more virtuous for calling you out for saying something that sounds very racist.

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,660
That doesn't invalidate their point, does it?

84
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,560
This argument is about as stupid as your garden variety ad hominem argument.

85
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,440
Oh, you criticize my behavior?

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,360
Well, you're dumb, and you smell, and you just want to look good.

87
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,480
Because it doesn't even need to be an inaccurate statement to be clearly bullshit.

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,640
Let's say I really do smell quite a bit, and I really am dumb, and I do secretly think

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,500
being nice to women on the internet will one day reap dividends in the form of insert comical

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,480
foreplay euphemism here.

91
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Does that make my argument wrong?

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
It is an actual historical fact—

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,480
No, this is actually quite hotly debated, please do your own research.

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,360
—that Socrates smelt like shit and didn't take care of his kids either.

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,480
He might have secretly thought he was super smart and liked looking smart by criticizing

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,480
people, but that doesn't make him any less biting or correct when he tears apart someone's

97
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,020
belief system in a story.

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,160
You can be right and take regular showers, although I myself have trouble with that concept,

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,520
but in a discussion, the ideas should be the focus, not the perceived self-righteousness,

100
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,880
extant or otherwise, of the people you disagree with.

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,840
Secondly, it seems reductive to believe you know a person's intent or secret deep inner

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,000
feelings, because I don't even know my inner feelings on a lot of topics.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to stay away from male Greek statues because they awaken things in me, so to pretend

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,400
that I could deign to know your inner feelings is stupid.

105
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,280
I like to take people at their word.

106
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,160
Whining that people you don't like are just virtue-signaling is essentially a method of

107
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,840
protecting yourself from a real discussion.

108
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,760
These people will often also decry things like safe spaces, not realizing that they

109
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,040
do so from the safety of the one in their own head, where all opposing arguments have

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,000
been scrubbed clean of content.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,440
Thirdly, once you invoke it, you grant that it's wrong to criticize things just to make

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,920
yourself look good, but isn't that inherently what you're doing when you accuse someone

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,080
else of doing it?

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,160
You're saying, quite straightforwardly, I am smarter and better than you because I

115
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
don't virtue-signal.

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,080
That's what some people actually write!

117
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
They literally write this!

118
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,200
I care the least, so I'm more rational!

119
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I win!

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,440
They wear, I don't virtue-signal, like a badge, as if it signals what virtuous people

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
they are.

122
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,680
Heck, even the creator of the term is getting in on the action.

123
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Look at me!

124
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
I invented virtue-signaling!

125
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,840
Shower me with praise, please, alt-right weirdos!

126
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,200
Well, I might not be right, but at least I don't virtue-signal.

127
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,400
People who use this term often simply don't have any worthwhile criticisms to make of

128
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,640
the arguments that face them, or are unable to express it meaningfully, so they pick a

129
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
word from the list and throw it out there.

130
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,720
Accusing someone of virtue-signaling isn't simply lazy and often inaccurate.

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,640
It actively flies in the face of the very concept of words having meaning.

132
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,880
You can see the same thing taking place on the opposite side as well.

133
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,680
The phrase problematic has become something of a joke itself because of its overuse, but

134
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,320
These people tend to then turn around and explain why these things are, as it were,

135
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
problematic.

136
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,760
These people can be right or wrong in their assessments, of course, but at least they

137
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,640
don't just yell, virtue-signal, lol, and then run away.

138
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,800
I'm still waiting to be rewarded with sex, though.

139
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm sure it'll happen any day now.

140
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,200
Is this it?

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,520
Is my quiplashing finally getting me a shaft-shellacking?

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,440
Have the heavenly stew guardians finally opened the gates to the gaff of Spaff?

143
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Oh, wait.

144
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,400
What's this?

145
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,480
Something's wrong!

146
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,000
No, it's you!

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wonz!

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,240
The W I C K E D O M N I C I D A L M A T R I O D S!

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,320
Bad person!

150
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,280
Look at you, White Knight!

151
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,000
A pathetic creature of cock and beta panting and sweating as you try to find someone to

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,320
defend for sex!

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,740
Look, I appreciate the reference, but System Shock 2 came out, what, 24 years ago?

154
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,620
Can we, like, just talk in plain English?

155
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,860
Okay, basically, it turns out to get laid, you have to actually be super abusive and

156
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,700
manipulative towards people and treat them with zero respect.

157
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,500
God, haven't you read 30 Bangs?

158
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,780
But isn't the real priority to treat people like reasonable humans and not do it for some

159
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
kind of reward?

160
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,540
No, because then your reward is feeling good about yourself for not wanting a reward.

161
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,860
Is it ever possible to have a discussion of what is moral and good?

162
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,680
No, it's actually all about sex, literally all the time.

163
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Oh, hang on.

164
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
You're not Wonz.

165
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,980
You're...

166
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,300
Manosphere!

167
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,580
I knew you were behind this!

168
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,760
Oh shut up, you little spangler.

169
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,300
Can't you see you'll become a stronger person once you've purchased my testosterone cream

170
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,740
and self-help e-books and start using fantasy literature as a basis for your socioeconomic

171
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,980
world views?

172
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,140
I literally can't see anything at this point.

173
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,420
This transcendent void is actually really hard on my eyes.

174
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,920
No, don't look away!

175
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,420
Pay attention to me!

176
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,400
Pay attention to me!

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,220
Nooooooooo!

178
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,440
You guys are-

179
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,780
Oh Jesus, my eyes!

180
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,360
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

181
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,460
I'd like to say a special thanks to Jason Walter,

182
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,580
Jenny Angel,

183
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,260
John,

184
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,220
Cav P,

185
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,540
Kevin M. Knippy,

186
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,500
MK,

187
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Made of Stone,

188
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,580
Max Scher,

189
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
Rob Brunt,

190
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Sam A. L.,

191
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,820
Scott Gurtin,

192
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,260
Thad Wazielewski,

193
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,540
and Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes.

194
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,140
Oh, and also Casey Schneibel, whose name I pronounced wrong last time.

195
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
Sorry.

196
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, and while we're at it, I-I-I spelt Beck McKenzie, Ben McKenzie. I'm so sorry.

197
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,540
Special thanks to Chris Morrow, who is voicing me right now.
