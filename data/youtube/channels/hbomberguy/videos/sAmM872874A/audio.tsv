0	10640	I'm seeing the accusation of virtue signaling going around a lot lately.
10640	14800	No, they're not criticizing their skill at the rare Dreamcast Lighthouse escape game
14800	15800	Virtua Signal.
15800	18360	They're actually judging them as people.
18360	22600	In fact, one rational, level-headed individual directly called me out for it in a long rant
22600	24800	where he gets my name wrong.
24800	29600	Virtue signaling is the latest in a long line of hastily propagated, alt-right, near-reactionary
29600	36880	buzzwords, including cuck, sgeez, anti-GG, or everyone who thinks harassment is bad,
36880	42200	literally who if you're one of the prime targets, betas, feminazis, white knights,
42200	45600	spanglers, a phrase on the up-and-up in the community, get ready to be called one of those
45600	48880	on Twitter in the near future, and of course, cultural Marxists.
48880	51520	Oh, sorry, does that phrase have really bad implications?
51520	55440	Shit, we'd better come up with a new word that means the exact same bad idea.
55440	56440	Wha-?
56440	57440	Uh, regressive leftists?
57440	59160	There, that'll do.
59160	64040	The term was originally coined by James Bartholomew for The Spectator, to decry people who say
64040	69120	I don't like this thing very much, in order to feel good about themselves, and then just
69120	74400	vote Labour every few years or whatever, and take no stake in actually making things better.
74400	77120	This is a fairly straightforwardly good call to action.
77120	81160	The term actually decried a real, existing problem.
81160	84880	Of course, then the idiots got their hands on it.
84880	90640	When interpreted poorly, almost every belief, statement, or piece of writing becomes virtue
90640	94280	signalling, an attempt to look good for thinking the right thing.
94280	95360	What's that?
95360	96360	You like reading books?
96360	100600	You're just trying to look like you do a lot of reading to look smart, you virtue signaller.
100600	101600	What's this?
101600	105160	You tweet pictures of Kamen Rider figurines in silly and compromising poses?
105160	109520	You're just trying to signal that you own cool toys and have good photography ability.
109520	110880	Get out of here.
110880	111880	Oh, what's that?
111880	116400	You criticize me when I say racist or sexist things, or have bizarre fixations with one
116400	117720	particular woman?
117720	122520	Clearly, you just want to make yourself look enlightened, and like a vaguely good person
122520	127360	so people will think you're nice, and, I don't know, sleep with you?
127360	131160	This goes hand in hand with another popular term, the white knight.
131160	135520	White knights are traditionally people who defend women on the internet out of the misguided
135520	140680	belief it will result in some kind of reward, usually sex, which sounds difficult to do
140680	145520	over the internet, but who knew apparently the best way to get it is to be nice to people?
145520	149920	As someone who frequently impersonates a woman in online games, I can confirm that white
149920	155240	knights do actually exist, and they are really weird, but we've reached a point where any
155240	161520	male person defending any female person for any reason nets an accusation of just wanting
161520	165720	them to pull their dipstick, because why else would anyone side with a woman, right?
165720	169280	It's not like you can just, you know, think they're right about something.
169280	174480	Women's rights activists and pick-up artists love to decry criticism as virtue signaling,
174480	178480	but not because they're against the idea that it's wrong to say and do things for
178480	179480	sex.
179480	183520	In fact, people have built careers on telling these groups exactly what to say and do in
183520	187640	order to get someone to sleep with you, so their problem with virtue signaling can't
187640	190520	be that it's wrong to say what you think will get you laid.
190520	194640	Their problem appears to be that they view it as an ineffective fuckstrat, and of course,
194640	199640	To bring the whole thing back on itself like a bulging, veiny Ouroboros, whenever they're
199640	204640	tasked with formulating their own beliefs in detail, they invariably end up appealing
204640	207840	to things like classical virtue.
207840	213480	You know, those things put forward by someone, at some point in history, interpreted by me.
213480	215000	Look at this statue.
215000	218120	Clearly this means the Greeks were afraid of homosexuality and thought it should be
218120	219120	repressed.
219120	221960	Pay no attention to actual historical fact.
221960	225040	You only look at the facts because you want to look smart.
225040	229040	You know, the Greeks, the famously straight people.
229040	232320	And when they're not accusing them of trying to get people to sleep with them, they're
232320	233720	accusing them of being gay.
233720	238200	I would just like to take a moment to point out that we've reached a situation where
238200	245500	to some people, being gay and wanting to have sex with women are interchangeable.
245500	250440	This eradication of a term's meaning is part of a deeper problem with internet culture.
250640	252480	It's the same with the word cuck.
252480	256960	A few years ago, cuckoldry was a fetish where one spouse engages in sex with another person
256960	258480	to emasculate their partner.
258480	262440	Now the word is just another one-size-fits-all disparagement to use against people who you
262440	263440	don't like.
263440	266720	You can say what you like about chanboards, but at the very least they're incredibly
266720	269720	effective at rendering words meaningless.
269720	273080	Instead of having to defend your point of view, which could be really difficult, you
273080	276640	can just ignore them and dance around accusing them of trying to look like they're good
276640	277640	people.
277640	281880	It's a fantastic defense mechanism, except for the part where it isn't very good at
281880	282880	all.
282880	284680	Let's give the three main reasons why.
284680	289080	Firstly, let's say the person you're arguing with really does think they're making themselves
289080	294640	look more virtuous for calling you out for saying something that sounds very racist.
294640	297660	That doesn't invalidate their point, does it?
297660	301560	This argument is about as stupid as your garden variety ad hominem argument.
301560	303440	Oh, you criticize my behavior?
303440	307360	Well, you're dumb, and you smell, and you just want to look good.
307360	312480	Because it doesn't even need to be an inaccurate statement to be clearly bullshit.
312480	317640	Let's say I really do smell quite a bit, and I really am dumb, and I do secretly think
317640	322500	being nice to women on the internet will one day reap dividends in the form of insert comical
322500	324480	foreplay euphemism here.
324480	327400	Does that make my argument wrong?
327400	329400	It is an actual historical fact—
329400	332480	No, this is actually quite hotly debated, please do your own research.
332480	336360	—that Socrates smelt like shit and didn't take care of his kids either.
336360	340480	He might have secretly thought he was super smart and liked looking smart by criticizing
340480	345480	people, but that doesn't make him any less biting or correct when he tears apart someone's
345480	347020	belief system in a story.
347020	352160	You can be right and take regular showers, although I myself have trouble with that concept,
352160	357520	but in a discussion, the ideas should be the focus, not the perceived self-righteousness,
357520	360880	extant or otherwise, of the people you disagree with.
361080	365840	Secondly, it seems reductive to believe you know a person's intent or secret deep inner
365840	370000	feelings, because I don't even know my inner feelings on a lot of topics.
370000	375000	I have to stay away from male Greek statues because they awaken things in me, so to pretend
375000	378400	that I could deign to know your inner feelings is stupid.
378400	380280	I like to take people at their word.
380280	385160	Whining that people you don't like are just virtue-signaling is essentially a method of
385160	387840	protecting yourself from a real discussion.
387840	392760	These people will often also decry things like safe spaces, not realizing that they
392760	397040	do so from the safety of the one in their own head, where all opposing arguments have
397040	399000	been scrubbed clean of content.
399000	403440	Thirdly, once you invoke it, you grant that it's wrong to criticize things just to make
403440	407920	yourself look good, but isn't that inherently what you're doing when you accuse someone
407920	409080	else of doing it?
409080	413160	You're saying, quite straightforwardly, I am smarter and better than you because I
413160	415160	don't virtue-signal.
415160	417080	That's what some people actually write!
417080	419080	They literally write this!
419080	421200	I care the least, so I'm more rational!
421200	422200	I win!
422200	428440	They wear, I don't virtue-signal, like a badge, as if it signals what virtuous people
428440	429440	they are.
429440	432680	Heck, even the creator of the term is getting in on the action.
432680	433680	Look at me!
433680	435360	I invented virtue-signaling!
435360	438840	Shower me with praise, please, alt-right weirdos!
438840	444200	Well, I might not be right, but at least I don't virtue-signal.
444280	448400	People who use this term often simply don't have any worthwhile criticisms to make of
448400	452640	the arguments that face them, or are unable to express it meaningfully, so they pick a
452640	455200	word from the list and throw it out there.
455200	458720	Accusing someone of virtue-signaling isn't simply lazy and often inaccurate.
458720	462640	It actively flies in the face of the very concept of words having meaning.
462640	465880	You can see the same thing taking place on the opposite side as well.
465880	470680	The phrase problematic has become something of a joke itself because of its overuse, but
470680	475320	These people tend to then turn around and explain why these things are, as it were,
475320	476320	problematic.
476320	479760	These people can be right or wrong in their assessments, of course, but at least they
479760	483640	don't just yell, virtue-signal, lol, and then run away.
483640	485800	I'm still waiting to be rewarded with sex, though.
485800	487800	I'm sure it'll happen any day now.
487800	492200	Is this it?
492200	495520	Is my quiplashing finally getting me a shaft-shellacking?
495520	500440	Have the heavenly stew guardians finally opened the gates to the gaff of Spaff?
500440	501440	Oh, wait.
501440	503400	What's this?
503400	504480	Something's wrong!
504480	507000	No, it's you!
507000	508000	Wonz!
508000	511240	The W I C K E D O M N I C I D A L M A T R I O D S!
511240	512320	Bad person!
512320	516280	Look at you, White Knight!
516280	522000	A pathetic creature of cock and beta panting and sweating as you try to find someone to
522000	523320	defend for sex!
523320	528740	Look, I appreciate the reference, but System Shock 2 came out, what, 24 years ago?
529420	531620	Can we, like, just talk in plain English?
531620	536860	Okay, basically, it turns out to get laid, you have to actually be super abusive and
536860	539700	manipulative towards people and treat them with zero respect.
539700	542500	God, haven't you read 30 Bangs?
542500	547780	But isn't the real priority to treat people like reasonable humans and not do it for some
547780	548780	kind of reward?
548780	554540	No, because then your reward is feeling good about yourself for not wanting a reward.
554540	557860	Is it ever possible to have a discussion of what is moral and good?
558180	561680	No, it's actually all about sex, literally all the time.
561680	562680	Oh, hang on.
562680	563680	You're not Wonz.
563680	564980	You're...
567940	569300	Manosphere!
569300	571580	I knew you were behind this!
571580	573760	Oh shut up, you little spangler.
573760	578300	Can't you see you'll become a stronger person once you've purchased my testosterone cream
578300	583740	and self-help e-books and start using fantasy literature as a basis for your socioeconomic
583740	584980	world views?
585460	588140	I literally can't see anything at this point.
588140	591420	This transcendent void is actually really hard on my eyes.
592100	593920	No, don't look away!
593920	595420	Pay attention to me!
595420	597400	Pay attention to me!
597400	600220	Nooooooooo!
600220	601440	You guys are-
601440	602780	Oh Jesus, my eyes!
602780	604360	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
615220	617460	I'd like to say a special thanks to Jason Walter,
617460	618580	Jenny Angel,
618580	619260	John,

627820	629260	Thad Wazielewski,
629260	631540	and Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes.
631540	635140	Oh, and also Casey Schneibel, whose name I pronounced wrong last time.
635140	636140	Sorry.
636140	641100	Oh, and while we're at it, I-I-I spelt Beck McKenzie, Ben McKenzie. I'm so sorry.
641100	645540	Special thanks to Chris Morrow, who is voicing me right now.
