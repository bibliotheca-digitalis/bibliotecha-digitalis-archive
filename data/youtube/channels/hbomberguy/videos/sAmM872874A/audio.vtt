00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
I'm seeing the accusation of virtue signaling going around a lot lately.

00:10.640 --> 00:14.800
No, they're not criticizing their skill at the rare Dreamcast Lighthouse escape game

00:14.800 --> 00:15.800
Virtua Signal.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.360
They're actually judging them as people.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.600
In fact, one rational, level-headed individual directly called me out for it in a long rant

00:22.600 --> 00:24.800
where he gets my name wrong.

00:24.800 --> 00:29.600
Virtue signaling is the latest in a long line of hastily propagated, alt-right, near-reactionary

00:29.600 --> 00:36.880
buzzwords, including cuck, sgeez, anti-GG, or everyone who thinks harassment is bad,

00:36.880 --> 00:42.200
literally who if you're one of the prime targets, betas, feminazis, white knights,

00:42.200 --> 00:45.600
spanglers, a phrase on the up-and-up in the community, get ready to be called one of those

00:45.600 --> 00:48.880
on Twitter in the near future, and of course, cultural Marxists.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.520
Oh, sorry, does that phrase have really bad implications?

00:51.520 --> 00:55.440
Shit, we'd better come up with a new word that means the exact same bad idea.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.440
Wha-?

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
Uh, regressive leftists?

00:57.440 --> 00:59.160
There, that'll do.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.040
The term was originally coined by James Bartholomew for The Spectator, to decry people who say

01:04.040 --> 01:09.120
I don't like this thing very much, in order to feel good about themselves, and then just

01:09.120 --> 01:14.400
vote Labour every few years or whatever, and take no stake in actually making things better.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.120
This is a fairly straightforwardly good call to action.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.160
The term actually decried a real, existing problem.

01:21.160 --> 01:24.880
Of course, then the idiots got their hands on it.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.640
When interpreted poorly, almost every belief, statement, or piece of writing becomes virtue

01:30.640 --> 01:34.280
signalling, an attempt to look good for thinking the right thing.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.360
What's that?

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
You like reading books?

01:36.360 --> 01:40.600
You're just trying to look like you do a lot of reading to look smart, you virtue signaller.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
What's this?

01:41.600 --> 01:45.160
You tweet pictures of Kamen Rider figurines in silly and compromising poses?

01:45.160 --> 01:49.520
You're just trying to signal that you own cool toys and have good photography ability.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.880
Get out of here.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.880
Oh, what's that?

01:51.880 --> 01:56.400
You criticize me when I say racist or sexist things, or have bizarre fixations with one

01:56.400 --> 01:57.720
particular woman?

01:57.720 --> 02:02.520
Clearly, you just want to make yourself look enlightened, and like a vaguely good person

02:02.520 --> 02:07.360
so people will think you're nice, and, I don't know, sleep with you?

02:07.360 --> 02:11.160
This goes hand in hand with another popular term, the white knight.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.520
White knights are traditionally people who defend women on the internet out of the misguided

02:15.520 --> 02:20.680
belief it will result in some kind of reward, usually sex, which sounds difficult to do

02:20.680 --> 02:25.520
over the internet, but who knew apparently the best way to get it is to be nice to people?

02:25.520 --> 02:29.920
As someone who frequently impersonates a woman in online games, I can confirm that white

02:29.920 --> 02:35.240
knights do actually exist, and they are really weird, but we've reached a point where any

02:35.240 --> 02:41.520
male person defending any female person for any reason nets an accusation of just wanting

02:41.520 --> 02:45.720
them to pull their dipstick, because why else would anyone side with a woman, right?

02:45.720 --> 02:49.280
It's not like you can just, you know, think they're right about something.

02:49.280 --> 02:54.480
Women's rights activists and pick-up artists love to decry criticism as virtue signaling,

02:54.480 --> 02:58.480
but not because they're against the idea that it's wrong to say and do things for

02:58.480 --> 02:59.480
sex.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.520
In fact, people have built careers on telling these groups exactly what to say and do in

03:03.520 --> 03:07.640
order to get someone to sleep with you, so their problem with virtue signaling can't

03:07.640 --> 03:10.520
be that it's wrong to say what you think will get you laid.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.640
Their problem appears to be that they view it as an ineffective fuckstrat, and of course,

03:14.640 --> 03:19.640
To bring the whole thing back on itself like a bulging, veiny Ouroboros, whenever they're

03:19.640 --> 03:24.640
tasked with formulating their own beliefs in detail, they invariably end up appealing

03:24.640 --> 03:27.840
to things like classical virtue.

03:27.840 --> 03:33.480
You know, those things put forward by someone, at some point in history, interpreted by me.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.000
Look at this statue.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.120
Clearly this means the Greeks were afraid of homosexuality and thought it should be

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
repressed.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.960
Pay no attention to actual historical fact.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.040
You only look at the facts because you want to look smart.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.040
You know, the Greeks, the famously straight people.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.320
And when they're not accusing them of trying to get people to sleep with them, they're

03:52.320 --> 03:53.720
accusing them of being gay.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.200
I would just like to take a moment to point out that we've reached a situation where

03:58.200 --> 04:05.500
to some people, being gay and wanting to have sex with women are interchangeable.

04:05.500 --> 04:10.440
This eradication of a term's meaning is part of a deeper problem with internet culture.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.480
It's the same with the word cuck.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.960
A few years ago, cuckoldry was a fetish where one spouse engages in sex with another person

04:16.960 --> 04:18.480
to emasculate their partner.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.440
Now the word is just another one-size-fits-all disparagement to use against people who you

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
don't like.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.720
You can say what you like about chanboards, but at the very least they're incredibly

04:26.720 --> 04:29.720
effective at rendering words meaningless.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.080
Instead of having to defend your point of view, which could be really difficult, you

04:33.080 --> 04:36.640
can just ignore them and dance around accusing them of trying to look like they're good

04:36.640 --> 04:37.640
people.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.880
It's a fantastic defense mechanism, except for the part where it isn't very good at

04:41.880 --> 04:42.880
all.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.680
Let's give the three main reasons why.

04:44.680 --> 04:49.080
Firstly, let's say the person you're arguing with really does think they're making themselves

04:49.080 --> 04:54.640
look more virtuous for calling you out for saying something that sounds very racist.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.660
That doesn't invalidate their point, does it?

04:57.660 --> 05:01.560
This argument is about as stupid as your garden variety ad hominem argument.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.440
Oh, you criticize my behavior?

05:03.440 --> 05:07.360
Well, you're dumb, and you smell, and you just want to look good.

05:07.360 --> 05:12.480
Because it doesn't even need to be an inaccurate statement to be clearly bullshit.

05:12.480 --> 05:17.640
Let's say I really do smell quite a bit, and I really am dumb, and I do secretly think

05:17.640 --> 05:22.500
being nice to women on the internet will one day reap dividends in the form of insert comical

05:22.500 --> 05:24.480
foreplay euphemism here.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.400
Does that make my argument wrong?

05:27.400 --> 05:29.400
It is an actual historical fact—

05:29.400 --> 05:32.480
No, this is actually quite hotly debated, please do your own research.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.360
—that Socrates smelt like shit and didn't take care of his kids either.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.480
He might have secretly thought he was super smart and liked looking smart by criticizing

05:40.480 --> 05:45.480
people, but that doesn't make him any less biting or correct when he tears apart someone's

05:45.480 --> 05:47.020
belief system in a story.

05:47.020 --> 05:52.160
You can be right and take regular showers, although I myself have trouble with that concept,

05:52.160 --> 05:57.520
but in a discussion, the ideas should be the focus, not the perceived self-righteousness,

05:57.520 --> 06:00.880
extant or otherwise, of the people you disagree with.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.840
Secondly, it seems reductive to believe you know a person's intent or secret deep inner

06:05.840 --> 06:10.000
feelings, because I don't even know my inner feelings on a lot of topics.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
I have to stay away from male Greek statues because they awaken things in me, so to pretend

06:15.000 --> 06:18.400
that I could deign to know your inner feelings is stupid.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.280
I like to take people at their word.

06:20.280 --> 06:25.160
Whining that people you don't like are just virtue-signaling is essentially a method of

06:25.160 --> 06:27.840
protecting yourself from a real discussion.

06:27.840 --> 06:32.760
These people will often also decry things like safe spaces, not realizing that they

06:32.760 --> 06:37.040
do so from the safety of the one in their own head, where all opposing arguments have

06:37.040 --> 06:39.000
been scrubbed clean of content.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.440
Thirdly, once you invoke it, you grant that it's wrong to criticize things just to make

06:43.440 --> 06:47.920
yourself look good, but isn't that inherently what you're doing when you accuse someone

06:47.920 --> 06:49.080
else of doing it?

06:49.080 --> 06:53.160
You're saying, quite straightforwardly, I am smarter and better than you because I

06:53.160 --> 06:55.160
don't virtue-signal.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.080
That's what some people actually write!

06:57.080 --> 06:59.080
They literally write this!

06:59.080 --> 07:01.200
I care the least, so I'm more rational!

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
I win!

07:02.200 --> 07:08.440
They wear, I don't virtue-signal, like a badge, as if it signals what virtuous people

07:08.440 --> 07:09.440
they are.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.680
Heck, even the creator of the term is getting in on the action.

07:12.680 --> 07:13.680
Look at me!

07:13.680 --> 07:15.360
I invented virtue-signaling!

07:15.360 --> 07:18.840
Shower me with praise, please, alt-right weirdos!

07:18.840 --> 07:24.200
Well, I might not be right, but at least I don't virtue-signal.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.400
People who use this term often simply don't have any worthwhile criticisms to make of

07:28.400 --> 07:32.640
the arguments that face them, or are unable to express it meaningfully, so they pick a

07:32.640 --> 07:35.200
word from the list and throw it out there.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.720
Accusing someone of virtue-signaling isn't simply lazy and often inaccurate.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.640
It actively flies in the face of the very concept of words having meaning.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.880
You can see the same thing taking place on the opposite side as well.

07:45.880 --> 07:50.680
The phrase problematic has become something of a joke itself because of its overuse, but

07:50.680 --> 07:55.320
These people tend to then turn around and explain why these things are, as it were,

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
problematic.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.760
These people can be right or wrong in their assessments, of course, but at least they

07:59.760 --> 08:03.640
don't just yell, virtue-signal, lol, and then run away.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.800
I'm still waiting to be rewarded with sex, though.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.800
I'm sure it'll happen any day now.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.200
Is this it?

08:12.200 --> 08:15.520
Is my quiplashing finally getting me a shaft-shellacking?

08:15.520 --> 08:20.440
Have the heavenly stew guardians finally opened the gates to the gaff of Spaff?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.440
Oh, wait.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.400
What's this?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.480
Something's wrong!

08:24.480 --> 08:27.000
No, it's you!

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Wonz!

08:28.000 --> 08:31.240
The W I C K E D O M N I C I D A L M A T R I O D S!

08:31.240 --> 08:32.320
Bad person!

08:32.320 --> 08:36.280
Look at you, White Knight!

08:36.280 --> 08:42.000
A pathetic creature of cock and beta panting and sweating as you try to find someone to

08:42.000 --> 08:43.320
defend for sex!

08:43.320 --> 08:48.740
Look, I appreciate the reference, but System Shock 2 came out, what, 24 years ago?

08:49.420 --> 08:51.620
Can we, like, just talk in plain English?

08:51.620 --> 08:56.860
Okay, basically, it turns out to get laid, you have to actually be super abusive and

08:56.860 --> 08:59.700
manipulative towards people and treat them with zero respect.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.500
God, haven't you read 30 Bangs?

09:02.500 --> 09:07.780
But isn't the real priority to treat people like reasonable humans and not do it for some

09:07.780 --> 09:08.780
kind of reward?

09:08.780 --> 09:14.540
No, because then your reward is feeling good about yourself for not wanting a reward.

09:14.540 --> 09:17.860
Is it ever possible to have a discussion of what is moral and good?

09:18.180 --> 09:21.680
No, it's actually all about sex, literally all the time.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.680
Oh, hang on.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.680
You're not Wonz.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.980
You're...

09:27.940 --> 09:29.300
Manosphere!

09:29.300 --> 09:31.580
I knew you were behind this!

09:31.580 --> 09:33.760
Oh shut up, you little spangler.

09:33.760 --> 09:38.300
Can't you see you'll become a stronger person once you've purchased my testosterone cream

09:38.300 --> 09:43.740
and self-help e-books and start using fantasy literature as a basis for your socioeconomic

09:43.740 --> 09:44.980
world views?

09:45.460 --> 09:48.140
I literally can't see anything at this point.

09:48.140 --> 09:51.420
This transcendent void is actually really hard on my eyes.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.920
No, don't look away!

09:53.920 --> 09:55.420
Pay attention to me!

09:55.420 --> 09:57.400
Pay attention to me!

09:57.400 --> 10:00.220
Nooooooooo!

10:00.220 --> 10:01.440
You guys are-

10:01.440 --> 10:02.780
Oh Jesus, my eyes!

10:02.780 --> 10:04.360
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

10:15.220 --> 10:17.460
I'd like to say a special thanks to Jason Walter,

10:17.460 --> 10:18.580
Jenny Angel,

10:18.580 --> 10:19.260
John,

10:19.260 --> 10:20.220
Cav P,

10:20.220 --> 10:21.540
Kevin M. Knippy,

10:21.540 --> 10:22.500
MK,

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
Made of Stone,

10:23.500 --> 10:24.580
Max Scher,

10:24.580 --> 10:25.580
Rob Brunt,

10:25.580 --> 10:26.580
Sam A. L.,

10:26.580 --> 10:27.820
Scott Gurtin,

10:27.820 --> 10:29.260
Thad Wazielewski,

10:29.260 --> 10:31.540
and Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes.

10:31.540 --> 10:35.140
Oh, and also Casey Schneibel, whose name I pronounced wrong last time.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.140
Sorry.

10:36.140 --> 10:41.100
Oh, and while we're at it, I-I-I spelt Beck McKenzie, Ben McKenzie. I'm so sorry.

10:41.100 --> 10:45.540
Special thanks to Chris Morrow, who is voicing me right now.
