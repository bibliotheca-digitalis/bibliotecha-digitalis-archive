1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Oh, they did that part. What's this? Oh, there we go. There we go. Hello

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Hey, how's it going? Hey, I'm well, how are you all? It's hello. It's fantastic to meet you

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,640
Would you like to introduce yourself in case some people don't know who you are?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
I gotcha

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,360
Um, what's up, would you like to introduce yourself? I'm sure chat chat is going wild they know who you are, but

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,840
I need to know

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,200
Of course everyone. My name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I am the congresswoman for New York's 14th Congressional District

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Thank you so so much

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Today

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,280
Thank you, thank you to Chelsea for giving me the heads up and inviting me. Oh gosh, I committed so much voter fraud for you

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,920
It's amazing it's it's Wow

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,280
How is it going over there? The government is like shut down

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,520
Longest shut down in history. The government is currently shut down. It's the longest shut down in American history

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,400
our

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,280
TSA airport workers are not getting paid our FDA food inspectors are not getting paid

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,080
we have

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,320
Folks showing up to NASA that are not paid and they're showing up for free just to keep you know

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,860
Basic vital systems to keep our astronauts alive

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,240
You know continuing and so it's kind of a mess right now

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
And we're we're doing everything that we can

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
Well

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,080
Keep keep fighting. I think what you're doing is phenomenal and I'm glad that the the Democrats haven't

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,000
caved because it's a big thing to cave on and it's

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,240
It's good

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,480
yeah, absolutely, and it's an issue because

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,360
Regardless of whether it's for a wall or for anything else

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,400
The whole point is that if we caved on this no matter what the request was

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Then we're basically legitimizing the tactic of holding people's paychecks hostage and then they can do it again whenever they want. Yeah, exactly

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,280
For any agenda point. Yeah, I mean

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
It's not only that but like now we're like

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
We're now kids are yelling

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,440
You know build a wall to like indigenous people and like clear that you know

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,360
It's just this this whole wall notion is just a symbol for something else. Yeah, absolutely

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,080
That's absolutely it's a gigantic monument to white supremacy effectively. Exactly

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,520
Exactly and it's just you know

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,600
I I applaud you all for the organizing that you're doing because the best way that we fight against tactics like that is not just

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,280
resistance but by

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,400
Actively supporting and advancing the communities that that need advocacy the most so I really appreciate you and everyone who's joining you today

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Yeah

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,560
Did you think that it was gonna get to this point I

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
couldn't I

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Maybe have fantasized about anything remotely like this ever happening in my life and

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,360
Even they have not compared to what has happened. It's been amazing and

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,240
Just Wow, could I get you to say trans rights?

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,700
Pardon me. Yes, could I say trans rights, please? I know there's a lot of people in the chat who would love to hear it

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,520
Trans rights. Absolutely. It's a it's a no-brainer trans rights or civil rights or human rights

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,080
Thank you so much I've actually got a question to kind of bounce off of that

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,280
So you have done an absolutely stellar job over the last just a few weeks couple, you know

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
barely barely a month

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,120
taking the 70% tax rate and turning it from an abstract concept into a

52
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,120
specific policy that the public understands and

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,760
Is is there anything on the docket in terms of like trans policy making use of that same that same momentum to

55
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,160
Help the public understand actionable

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,000
policy goals for

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,280
Trans rights. Mm-hmm. I think that's an excellent question

58
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,120
It's a it's it's an interesting one as well because when we're talking about

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
Actually just fighting for equal protection

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,560
It's it's not as though we're trying to advance a specific policy as much as it is

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,080
We're trying it's more of I feel like a lot of the times. It's the war that we're having is a cultural one

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,000
Much more than just the more than a marginal tax rate is

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,880
so what we really need to do and show I think which

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,200
which I think we're starting to do is

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,640
have this conversation a lot more in our culture and so

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,680
You know for so long. I would say that Democrats in the United States have operated from a defensive

67
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
place for a very very long time and

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,160
And what we're what we're doing is just kind of going on the offensive

69
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,200
Like I just tweeted today that in the United States

70
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,720
We wouldn't have to talk about bathrooms at all. If everyone just washed their hands and minded their own business

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Amazing what an idea

72
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,040
and so so I think that that a lot of what we need to do is put things into perspective, but also

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,480
Continue to reassert that equal rights means equal rights. It doesn't matter

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,480
Who you are. It doesn't matter what you're wearing. It doesn't matter how you identify

75
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,680
and

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,520
You know in terms of legislation we can we can legislate protections or legislate, you know

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,080
And this is actually a question that we've had recently not just specifically to the trans community, but there was a

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,040
There was legislation that a Democrat was trying to propose

79
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,800
that was essentially a protection for our immigrant community and

80
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,560
but it was a constitutional protection, I believe and so

81
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,280
We actually didn't didn't co-sponsor it and we pushed we actually pushed back on it because introducing

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,880
Legislation that's that pretty much already reasserts what's in the Constitution makes it feel like it's up for debate

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Like if as if they well said

84
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,920
Right if they voted for the for the if they voted down the law

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,360
It would almost make the constitutional guarantees seem less valid. Yeah, and so we actually pushed back against it

86
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,280
even though that it may seem kind of like a

87
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,720
twisted logic or counterintuitive of sorts

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,960
But but we actually pushed back against it because we said we don't want to have a debate about what is already settled

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,680
Once you once you put that stuff up for discussion it

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,160
Yes

91
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Exactly. And so really what what I think we have to reassert is that when we say that equal rights for all

92
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,760
We mean equal rights for all no asterisk exceptions fine print nothing

93
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,200
Is so fantastic to hear and I'm glad we got you on I'd love to talk more about trans rights and

94
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,040
Tax rate, but I would also do you I need to ask do you know how to turn on the power in?

95
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,880
Frantic factory in Donkey Kong 64 because I've been I've been here for hours and I don't know

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,440
Do not I'm sorry Donkey Kong 64 is

97
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,920
Outside of my wheelhouse. Well, that's okay. I'm your wheelhouse is really really good

98
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,600
I just you know, you've lost my vote. No, no, this is

99
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,600
Please continue. I never owned an n64 though. I do think it's probably the best system out of all of them. I

100
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:04,280
Never owned an n64, but I used to go to my cousin's house all the time and she had Super Mario 64

101
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,600
Pokemon snap and probably a handful of other things. Yes

102
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,320
That's probably all I know how to play

103
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,640
Pokemon snap was fantastic. Please what you're saying was really important. I said that that was a poor taste joke

104
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Please please do continue

105
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,920
Yeah, I just I just want to say that like one of the biggest things that I find with the community

106
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,640
Like for me personally, it's like house is like the issues the biggest issues that we face or housing and health care

107
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Yeah

108
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Yeah

109
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Yeah, absolutely

110
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Isn't uniting behind

111
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,600
Single single issue things that only affect them. It's a single issue thing that affects absolutely everyone

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,480
Yeah, that's that's right. And that's when we have these conversations about intersectionality that are so important because

113
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,920
You know

114
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,000
The the trans community does face a crisis when it comes to housing and health care

115
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Like most people especially most Americans do except there's an added except when you have the added layer of discrimination

116
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,400
It makes these issues much more

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,860
acute in their crises than they usually are on average for other people and so

118
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,400
so it's important that we that we do talk about these issues in the economic frame, but not let go of the fact that

119
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,720
That discrimination is is a core reason for the economic

120
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,640
Hardship well said

121
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Well, that's that I'm sorry, I'm here so quickly, but I just wanted to pop in and say hello I do need to head out

122
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,880
Extremely short question just before you know, okay. Have you seen the AOC dances Twitter account? I have seen the

123
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
We had them

124
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah

125
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,360
It's great, I haven't seen all the tweets but I there was one I miss the classic what's the song what's the song

126
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm trying to remember. It's the 80s song

127
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,080
You can dance if you want to the LM safety dance

128
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,400
Well chat is losing their minds, thank you so so so much for stopping by of course

129
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,520
Of course made it a phenomenal weekend for many people. I'm so glad. Thank you for doing this work

130
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,280
I really appreciate it. Everyone appreciates it. No, thank you. Thank you for doing your work. And thank you

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
See you on TV, I'm so

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,080
Alexandria you are giving a lot of people a lot of hope right now. Thank you, and I

134
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,120
Really don't have anything to ask but just I just wanted to say that I'm kind of shaking

135
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
No reason to shake

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,280
Thank you, thank you so so very much and I'm so happy that

137
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,720
That you know, the movement isn't all just about one person either. It's that we can have these spontaneous

138
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,240
Joyous and supportive moments and any one of us can can be responsible and be the source of it

139
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,720
So I thank you all so much and have an amazing day

140
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Thank you. Bye. Bye

141
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Rights, that's right
