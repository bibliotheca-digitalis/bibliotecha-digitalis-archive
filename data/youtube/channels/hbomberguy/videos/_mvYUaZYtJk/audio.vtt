00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
Oh, they did that part. What's this? Oh, there we go. There we go. Hello

00:10.080 --> 00:15.880
Hey, how's it going? Hey, I'm well, how are you all? It's hello. It's fantastic to meet you

00:15.880 --> 00:18.640
Would you like to introduce yourself in case some people don't know who you are?

00:19.640 --> 00:21.640
Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes

00:22.240 --> 00:24.240
I gotcha

00:25.240 --> 00:32.360
Um, what's up, would you like to introduce yourself? I'm sure chat chat is going wild they know who you are, but

00:34.920 --> 00:36.840
I need to know

00:36.840 --> 00:45.200
Of course everyone. My name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I am the congresswoman for New York's 14th Congressional District

00:46.640 --> 00:49.640
Thank you so so much

00:51.080 --> 00:53.080
Today

00:55.120 --> 01:03.280
Thank you, thank you to Chelsea for giving me the heads up and inviting me. Oh gosh, I committed so much voter fraud for you

01:07.400 --> 01:09.920
It's amazing it's it's Wow

01:10.680 --> 01:13.280
How is it going over there? The government is like shut down

01:13.920 --> 01:20.520
Longest shut down in history. The government is currently shut down. It's the longest shut down in American history

01:21.240 --> 01:22.400
our

01:22.400 --> 01:29.280
TSA airport workers are not getting paid our FDA food inspectors are not getting paid

01:29.720 --> 01:31.080
we have

01:31.080 --> 01:38.320
Folks showing up to NASA that are not paid and they're showing up for free just to keep you know

01:38.640 --> 01:41.860
Basic vital systems to keep our astronauts alive

01:42.920 --> 01:46.240
You know continuing and so it's kind of a mess right now

01:47.000 --> 01:49.400
And we're we're doing everything that we can

01:50.400 --> 01:51.560
Well

01:51.560 --> 01:57.080
Keep keep fighting. I think what you're doing is phenomenal and I'm glad that the the Democrats haven't

01:57.600 --> 02:01.000
caved because it's a big thing to cave on and it's

02:01.800 --> 02:03.240
It's good

02:03.240 --> 02:05.480
yeah, absolutely, and it's an issue because

02:06.600 --> 02:10.360
Regardless of whether it's for a wall or for anything else

02:10.360 --> 02:15.400
The whole point is that if we caved on this no matter what the request was

02:15.400 --> 02:22.000
Then we're basically legitimizing the tactic of holding people's paychecks hostage and then they can do it again whenever they want. Yeah, exactly

02:22.520 --> 02:25.280
For any agenda point. Yeah, I mean

02:26.120 --> 02:28.120
It's not only that but like now we're like

02:28.560 --> 02:30.160
We're now kids are yelling

02:30.160 --> 02:34.440
You know build a wall to like indigenous people and like clear that you know

02:34.440 --> 02:38.360
It's just this this whole wall notion is just a symbol for something else. Yeah, absolutely

02:39.000 --> 02:44.080
That's absolutely it's a gigantic monument to white supremacy effectively. Exactly

02:44.840 --> 02:46.520
Exactly and it's just you know

02:46.520 --> 02:53.600
I I applaud you all for the organizing that you're doing because the best way that we fight against tactics like that is not just

02:53.760 --> 02:55.280
resistance but by

02:55.280 --> 03:03.400
Actively supporting and advancing the communities that that need advocacy the most so I really appreciate you and everyone who's joining you today

03:03.800 --> 03:05.800
Yeah

03:07.360 --> 03:09.560
Did you think that it was gonna get to this point I

03:10.520 --> 03:12.520
couldn't I

03:12.840 --> 03:17.840
Maybe have fantasized about anything remotely like this ever happening in my life and

03:18.640 --> 03:22.360
Even they have not compared to what has happened. It's been amazing and

03:23.840 --> 03:26.240
Just Wow, could I get you to say trans rights?

03:28.440 --> 03:32.700
Pardon me. Yes, could I say trans rights, please? I know there's a lot of people in the chat who would love to hear it

03:33.120 --> 03:38.520
Trans rights. Absolutely. It's a it's a no-brainer trans rights or civil rights or human rights

03:42.520 --> 03:47.080
Thank you so much I've actually got a question to kind of bounce off of that

03:47.960 --> 03:54.280
So you have done an absolutely stellar job over the last just a few weeks couple, you know

03:55.040 --> 03:57.040
barely barely a month

03:57.120 --> 04:03.120
taking the 70% tax rate and turning it from an abstract concept into a

04:04.040 --> 04:07.120
specific policy that the public understands and

04:07.360 --> 04:09.360
Yeah

04:09.400 --> 04:16.760
Is is there anything on the docket in terms of like trans policy making use of that same that same momentum to

04:17.080 --> 04:20.160
Help the public understand actionable

04:21.080 --> 04:23.000
policy goals for

04:23.000 --> 04:26.280
Trans rights. Mm-hmm. I think that's an excellent question

04:26.440 --> 04:32.120
It's a it's it's an interesting one as well because when we're talking about

04:32.800 --> 04:35.280
Actually just fighting for equal protection

04:36.040 --> 04:41.560
It's it's not as though we're trying to advance a specific policy as much as it is

04:41.560 --> 04:48.080
We're trying it's more of I feel like a lot of the times. It's the war that we're having is a cultural one

04:48.880 --> 04:53.000
Much more than just the more than a marginal tax rate is

04:53.600 --> 04:57.880
so what we really need to do and show I think which

04:58.600 --> 05:01.200
which I think we're starting to do is

05:02.440 --> 05:06.640
have this conversation a lot more in our culture and so

05:07.400 --> 05:12.680
You know for so long. I would say that Democrats in the United States have operated from a defensive

05:13.360 --> 05:15.520
place for a very very long time and

05:16.680 --> 05:21.160
And what we're what we're doing is just kind of going on the offensive

05:21.160 --> 05:24.200
Like I just tweeted today that in the United States

05:24.200 --> 05:28.720
We wouldn't have to talk about bathrooms at all. If everyone just washed their hands and minded their own business

05:29.720 --> 05:31.720
Amazing what an idea

05:32.080 --> 05:38.040
and so so I think that that a lot of what we need to do is put things into perspective, but also

05:38.840 --> 05:43.480
Continue to reassert that equal rights means equal rights. It doesn't matter

05:44.320 --> 05:48.480
Who you are. It doesn't matter what you're wearing. It doesn't matter how you identify

05:49.320 --> 05:50.680
and

05:50.680 --> 05:56.520
You know in terms of legislation we can we can legislate protections or legislate, you know

05:56.600 --> 06:02.080
And this is actually a question that we've had recently not just specifically to the trans community, but there was a

06:02.680 --> 06:06.040
There was legislation that a Democrat was trying to propose

06:06.880 --> 06:11.800
that was essentially a protection for our immigrant community and

06:13.040 --> 06:16.560
but it was a constitutional protection, I believe and so

06:17.520 --> 06:24.280
We actually didn't didn't co-sponsor it and we pushed we actually pushed back on it because introducing

06:24.840 --> 06:31.880
Legislation that's that pretty much already reasserts what's in the Constitution makes it feel like it's up for debate

06:32.240 --> 06:34.240
Like if as if they well said

06:35.200 --> 06:38.920
Right if they voted for the for the if they voted down the law

06:39.080 --> 06:46.360
It would almost make the constitutional guarantees seem less valid. Yeah, and so we actually pushed back against it

06:47.080 --> 06:49.280
even though that it may seem kind of like a

06:50.320 --> 06:52.720
twisted logic or counterintuitive of sorts

06:53.320 --> 06:59.960
But but we actually pushed back against it because we said we don't want to have a debate about what is already settled

07:00.080 --> 07:02.680
Once you once you put that stuff up for discussion it

07:03.760 --> 07:05.160
Yes

07:05.160 --> 07:13.160
Exactly. And so really what what I think we have to reassert is that when we say that equal rights for all

07:13.520 --> 07:18.760
We mean equal rights for all no asterisk exceptions fine print nothing

07:19.280 --> 07:25.200
Is so fantastic to hear and I'm glad we got you on I'd love to talk more about trans rights and

07:25.920 --> 07:31.040
Tax rate, but I would also do you I need to ask do you know how to turn on the power in?

07:31.520 --> 07:35.880
Frantic factory in Donkey Kong 64 because I've been I've been here for hours and I don't know

07:36.640 --> 07:40.440
Do not I'm sorry Donkey Kong 64 is

07:41.240 --> 07:45.920
Outside of my wheelhouse. Well, that's okay. I'm your wheelhouse is really really good

07:45.920 --> 07:48.600
I just you know, you've lost my vote. No, no, this is

07:49.200 --> 07:55.600
Please continue. I never owned an n64 though. I do think it's probably the best system out of all of them. I

07:56.880 --> 08:04.280
Never owned an n64, but I used to go to my cousin's house all the time and she had Super Mario 64

08:04.880 --> 08:08.600
Pokemon snap and probably a handful of other things. Yes

08:09.880 --> 08:12.320
That's probably all I know how to play

08:13.240 --> 08:20.640
Pokemon snap was fantastic. Please what you're saying was really important. I said that that was a poor taste joke

08:20.640 --> 08:22.640
Please please do continue

08:23.040 --> 08:28.920
Yeah, I just I just want to say that like one of the biggest things that I find with the community

08:28.920 --> 08:35.640
Like for me personally, it's like house is like the issues the biggest issues that we face or housing and health care

08:35.640 --> 08:37.640
Yeah

08:37.800 --> 08:39.800
Yeah

08:39.840 --> 08:41.840
Yeah, absolutely

08:42.840 --> 08:44.840
Isn't uniting behind

08:45.080 --> 08:50.600
Single single issue things that only affect them. It's a single issue thing that affects absolutely everyone

08:51.400 --> 08:57.480
Yeah, that's that's right. And that's when we have these conversations about intersectionality that are so important because

08:58.280 --> 08:58.920
You know

08:58.920 --> 09:04.000
The the trans community does face a crisis when it comes to housing and health care

09:04.240 --> 09:11.360
Like most people especially most Americans do except there's an added except when you have the added layer of discrimination

09:11.360 --> 09:14.400
It makes these issues much more

09:15.200 --> 09:19.860
acute in their crises than they usually are on average for other people and so

09:20.520 --> 09:26.400
so it's important that we that we do talk about these issues in the economic frame, but not let go of the fact that

09:27.240 --> 09:31.720
That discrimination is is a core reason for the economic

09:32.560 --> 09:34.640
Hardship well said

09:36.160 --> 09:41.840
Well, that's that I'm sorry, I'm here so quickly, but I just wanted to pop in and say hello I do need to head out

09:44.240 --> 09:50.880
Extremely short question just before you know, okay. Have you seen the AOC dances Twitter account? I have seen the

09:52.320 --> 09:54.320
We had them

09:56.560 --> 09:58.560
Yeah

10:01.720 --> 10:09.360
It's great, I haven't seen all the tweets but I there was one I miss the classic what's the song what's the song

10:09.360 --> 10:11.360
I'm trying to remember. It's the 80s song

10:12.240 --> 10:15.080
You can dance if you want to the LM safety dance

10:18.640 --> 10:24.400

Alexandria you are giving a lot of people a lot of hope right now. Thank you, and I

10:52.800 --> 10:59.120
Really don't have anything to ask but just I just wanted to say that I'm kind of shaking

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
No reason to shake

11:04.080 --> 11:08.280
Thank you, thank you so so very much and I'm so happy that

11:09.240 --> 11:14.720
That you know, the movement isn't all just about one person either. It's that we can have these spontaneous

11:15.480 --> 11:21.240
Joyous and supportive moments and any one of us can can be responsible and be the source of it

11:21.240 --> 11:23.720
So I thank you all so much and have an amazing day

11:24.960 --> 11:26.960
Thank you. Bye. Bye

11:26.960 --> 11:28.960
Rights, that's right
