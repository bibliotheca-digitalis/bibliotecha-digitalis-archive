15880	18640	Would you like to introduce yourself in case some people don't know who you are?
19640	21640	Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes
22240	24240	I gotcha
25240	32360	Um, what's up, would you like to introduce yourself? I'm sure chat chat is going wild they know who you are, but
34920	36840	I need to know
36840	45200	Of course everyone. My name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I am the congresswoman for New York's 14th Congressional District
46640	49640	Thank you so so much
51080	53080	Today
55120	63280	Thank you, thank you to Chelsea for giving me the heads up and inviting me. Oh gosh, I committed so much voter fraud for you
67400	69920	It's amazing it's it's Wow
70680	73280	How is it going over there? The government is like shut down
73920	80520	Longest shut down in history. The government is currently shut down. It's the longest shut down in American history
81240	82400	our
82400	89280	TSA airport workers are not getting paid our FDA food inspectors are not getting paid
89720	91080	we have
91080	98320	Folks showing up to NASA that are not paid and they're showing up for free just to keep you know
98640	101860	Basic vital systems to keep our astronauts alive
102920	106240	You know continuing and so it's kind of a mess right now
107000	109400	And we're we're doing everything that we can
110400	111560	Well
111560	117080	Keep keep fighting. I think what you're doing is phenomenal and I'm glad that the the Democrats haven't
117600	121000	caved because it's a big thing to cave on and it's
121800	123240	It's good
123240	125480	yeah, absolutely, and it's an issue because
126600	130360	Regardless of whether it's for a wall or for anything else
130360	135400	The whole point is that if we caved on this no matter what the request was
135400	142000	Then we're basically legitimizing the tactic of holding people's paychecks hostage and then they can do it again whenever they want. Yeah, exactly
142520	145280	For any agenda point. Yeah, I mean
146120	148120	It's not only that but like now we're like
148560	150160	We're now kids are yelling
150160	154440	You know build a wall to like indigenous people and like clear that you know
154440	158360	It's just this this whole wall notion is just a symbol for something else. Yeah, absolutely
159000	164080	That's absolutely it's a gigantic monument to white supremacy effectively. Exactly
164840	166520	Exactly and it's just you know
166520	173600	I I applaud you all for the organizing that you're doing because the best way that we fight against tactics like that is not just
173760	175280	resistance but by
175280	183400	Actively supporting and advancing the communities that that need advocacy the most so I really appreciate you and everyone who's joining you today
183800	185800	Yeah
187360	189560	Did you think that it was gonna get to this point I
190520	192520	couldn't I
192840	197840	Maybe have fantasized about anything remotely like this ever happening in my life and
198640	202360	Even they have not compared to what has happened. It's been amazing and
203840	206240	Just Wow, could I get you to say trans rights?
208440	212700	Pardon me. Yes, could I say trans rights, please? I know there's a lot of people in the chat who would love to hear it
213120	218520	Trans rights. Absolutely. It's a it's a no-brainer trans rights or civil rights or human rights
222520	227080	Thank you so much I've actually got a question to kind of bounce off of that
227960	234280	So you have done an absolutely stellar job over the last just a few weeks couple, you know
235040	237040	barely barely a month
237120	243120	taking the 70% tax rate and turning it from an abstract concept into a
244040	247120	specific policy that the public understands and
247360	249360	Yeah
249400	256760	Is is there anything on the docket in terms of like trans policy making use of that same that same momentum to
257080	260160	Help the public understand actionable
261080	263000	policy goals for
263000	266280	Trans rights. Mm-hmm. I think that's an excellent question
266440	272120	It's a it's it's an interesting one as well because when we're talking about
272800	275280	Actually just fighting for equal protection
276040	281560	It's it's not as though we're trying to advance a specific policy as much as it is
281560	288080	We're trying it's more of I feel like a lot of the times. It's the war that we're having is a cultural one
288880	293000	Much more than just the more than a marginal tax rate is
293600	297880	so what we really need to do and show I think which
298600	301200	which I think we're starting to do is
302440	306640	have this conversation a lot more in our culture and so
307400	312680	You know for so long. I would say that Democrats in the United States have operated from a defensive
313360	315520	place for a very very long time and
316680	321160	And what we're what we're doing is just kind of going on the offensive
321160	324200	Like I just tweeted today that in the United States
324200	328720	We wouldn't have to talk about bathrooms at all. If everyone just washed their hands and minded their own business
329720	331720	Amazing what an idea
332080	338040	and so so I think that that a lot of what we need to do is put things into perspective, but also
338840	343480	Continue to reassert that equal rights means equal rights. It doesn't matter
344320	348480	Who you are. It doesn't matter what you're wearing. It doesn't matter how you identify
349320	350680	and
350680	356520	You know in terms of legislation we can we can legislate protections or legislate, you know
356600	362080	And this is actually a question that we've had recently not just specifically to the trans community, but there was a
362680	366040	There was legislation that a Democrat was trying to propose
366880	371800	that was essentially a protection for our immigrant community and
373040	376560	but it was a constitutional protection, I believe and so
377520	384280	We actually didn't didn't co-sponsor it and we pushed we actually pushed back on it because introducing
384840	391880	Legislation that's that pretty much already reasserts what's in the Constitution makes it feel like it's up for debate
392240	394240	Like if as if they well said
395200	398920	Right if they voted for the for the if they voted down the law
399080	406360	It would almost make the constitutional guarantees seem less valid. Yeah, and so we actually pushed back against it
407080	409280	even though that it may seem kind of like a
410320	412720	twisted logic or counterintuitive of sorts
413320	419960	But but we actually pushed back against it because we said we don't want to have a debate about what is already settled
420080	422680	Once you once you put that stuff up for discussion it
423760	425160	Yes
425160	433160	Exactly. And so really what what I think we have to reassert is that when we say that equal rights for all
433520	438760	We mean equal rights for all no asterisk exceptions fine print nothing
439280	445200	Is so fantastic to hear and I'm glad we got you on I'd love to talk more about trans rights and
445920	451040	Tax rate, but I would also do you I need to ask do you know how to turn on the power in?
451520	455880	Frantic factory in Donkey Kong 64 because I've been I've been here for hours and I don't know
456640	460440	Do not I'm sorry Donkey Kong 64 is
461240	465920	Outside of my wheelhouse. Well, that's okay. I'm your wheelhouse is really really good
465920	468600	I just you know, you've lost my vote. No, no, this is
469200	475600	Please continue. I never owned an n64 though. I do think it's probably the best system out of all of them. I
476880	484280	Never owned an n64, but I used to go to my cousin's house all the time and she had Super Mario 64
484880	488600	Pokemon snap and probably a handful of other things. Yes
489880	492320	That's probably all I know how to play
493240	500640	Pokemon snap was fantastic. Please what you're saying was really important. I said that that was a poor taste joke
500640	502640	Please please do continue
503040	508920	Yeah, I just I just want to say that like one of the biggest things that I find with the community
508920	515640	Like for me personally, it's like house is like the issues the biggest issues that we face or housing and health care
515640	517640	Yeah
517800	519800	Yeah
519840	521840	Yeah, absolutely
522840	524840	Isn't uniting behind
525080	530600	Single single issue things that only affect them. It's a single issue thing that affects absolutely everyone
531400	537480	Yeah, that's that's right. And that's when we have these conversations about intersectionality that are so important because
538280	538920	You know
538920	544000	The the trans community does face a crisis when it comes to housing and health care
544240	551360	Like most people especially most Americans do except there's an added except when you have the added layer of discrimination
551360	554400	It makes these issues much more
555200	559860	acute in their crises than they usually are on average for other people and so
560520	566400	so it's important that we that we do talk about these issues in the economic frame, but not let go of the fact that
567240	571720	That discrimination is is a core reason for the economic
572560	574640	Hardship well said
576160	581840	Well, that's that I'm sorry, I'm here so quickly, but I just wanted to pop in and say hello I do need to head out
584240	590880	Extremely short question just before you know, okay. Have you seen the AOC dances Twitter account? I have seen the
592320	594320	We had them
596560	598560	Yeah
601720	609360	It's great, I haven't seen all the tweets but I there was one I miss the classic what's the song what's the song
609360	611360	I'm trying to remember. It's the 80s song
612240	615080	You can dance if you want to the LM safety dance
618640	624400	Well chat is losing their minds, thank you so so so much for stopping by of course

664080	668280	Thank you, thank you so so very much and I'm so happy that
669240	674720	That you know, the movement isn't all just about one person either. It's that we can have these spontaneous
