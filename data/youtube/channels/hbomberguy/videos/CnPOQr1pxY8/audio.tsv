0	8780	In the middle of Wiltshire lies a ring of large standing stones, each weighing around 25 tons.
8780	13120	It is believed the monument was assembled between 4,000 or 5,000 years ago.
13120	18540	Archaeological evidence suggests it may have been a burial site or perhaps a place of healing where the injured were taken.
18540	22380	Some also theorize it may have had a religious or astronomical importance.
22380	24780	We call this place Stonehenge.
24780	28880	We also call it a monument, but we don't even know if its creators would think such a thing.
28880	33640	The culture that produced it left no written records, and even how it was built is still up for debate.
33640	37340	In 1136, in his book, The History of the Kings of Britain,
37340	42800	Geoffrey of Monmouth, an early British historiographer, claimed the wizard Merlin built Stonehenge.
42800	46220	Here's an illustration from the mid-14th century based on that theory.
46220	50880	For roughly 500 years, building something like Stonehenge seemed so difficult
50880	53420	that it was commonly accepted that a wizard did it.
53420	55880	Apparently, he did it with his bare hands, too.
55880	57260	Thanks, Geoffrey!
57260	62020	It's a mysterious place because it provides us with questions and no real answers.
62020	66300	What was the intent of its creators? What did they think of it, and what became of them?
66300	68980	What would a Britain built by these people look like?
68980	73020	The so-called monument points away to a version of the world that never came to be.
73020	78680	Instead, it's one of the sole creations of a culture whose ideas and intent have simply vanished.
78680	82640	Will we ever really know who built Stonehenge, or what it was for?
84100	85340	Probably not.
85380	88260	And besides, it's just a bunch of rocks.
95060	97420	Anyway, today we're going to talk about Dragonslayer.
115340	120340	You play as a police mouse, who has to take back stolen goods from a gang of cats
120340	124060	by bouncing around in a weird void with random objects in it.
124060	127100	You can't really tell those pinky-purply things are cats,
127100	131600	and also, one would question the ability of a police captain who sent a mouse with no backup
131600	134020	to confiscate stolen goods from an army of cats,
134020	136180	but, you know, it's a pretty simple game.
136180	140340	It's a game where you have to play as a mouse, and it's a game where you have to play as a cat.
140340	145020	...police captain who sent a mouse with no backup to confiscate stolen goods from an army of cats,
145020	146560	but it's fine enough.
146560	149220	On June 14th, Mario Brothers hit arcades.
149220	152600	This was the first appearance of Mario's brother, Luigi.
152600	155760	Oh boy, I'm so happy to meet Mario, but with different colors.
155760	159220	Together, up to two players can jump around in a hellish void
159220	162100	knocking pixelated facsimiles of turtles around.
162100	163800	I mean, both of these games are fun to play,
163800	168880	but visually speaking, they're pretty poor appropriations of the thing the player's told they're doing.
168920	171720	I'm telling you all this so you can maybe imagine the impact when,
171720	173460	on June 19th that year,
173460	178720	just five days after Mario Brothers told you this mass of colors was a man called Luigi,
178720	179720	this happened.
180800	183560	["Dragon's Lair"]
183560	187640	["Dragon's Lair." You control the actions of a daring adventurer
187640	190600	finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard."
190600	192520	Hey, look! It's an actual person
192520	196520	who is trying to not die in an actual dungeon-looking place,
196520	197940	and look how much animation there is!
197960	201340	Look at the actual capital-A animation!
201340	207020	And if we look closely enough, we can even, maybe, see a game in here somewhere.
207020	209060	The mechanics of the game are very simplistic.
209060	212480	You watch the pretty impressively animated character make his way through a room,
212480	215060	and then press one of four directions or the attack button
215060	217140	when it's appropriate to do one of those things,
217140	220400	and if you do the wrong thing, you lose a life and get to watch a death animation.
220400	222560	And to store all the data for those animations,
222560	226360	the arcade game used a revolutionary content distribution system for the time
226360	228320	called a Laserdisc.
228320	229060	Ow!
229060	231100	Laserdiscs had been in use since the late 70s,
231100	234980	but the idea of using one of these as a way of storing more picture and sound information
234980	238780	than a normal arcade game could use hadn't been implemented in many games at this point.
238780	241820	This game was designed by Don Bluth, former Disney animator,
241820	244320	and Rick Dyer—forget about this guy, you'll never hear from him again,
244320	245600	let's just talk about Don Bluth some more—
245600	249600	he'd just made The Secret of NIMH, one of the best-looking animated films ever,
249600	251740	and was about to go on to make Rock-a-Doodle,
251740	252740	Thumbelina,
252740	254240	A Troll in Central Park,
254240	255600	The Pebble and the Penguin,
255640	256800	Titan A.E.,
256800	258800	and also some good films.
258800	261440	I never saw any of the good ones growing up, um, so...
261440	264020	Bluth and his small team used their animation chops
264020	268020	to create an actually nice-looking game with dynamism and charm.
268020	270360	The game looked amazing, and everyone knew it.
270360	272520	Even though it was more expensive to play than other games,
272520	274100	they had huge lines at arcades,
274100	275640	and the machine sold amazingly,
275640	277640	with arcade producers partially thanking it
277640	280400	for getting them through a financially difficult time in history.
280400	282100	And I do mean difficult.
282100	284260	Outside of arcades, what would later be called
284260	288180	the Great Video Game Crash of 1983 was happening.
288180	291940	The revenues of home game sales dropped almost 97%,
291940	294100	but Dragon's Lair and its appealing gimmick
294100	297020	had somewhat insulated arcades from these troubles.
297020	299680	This article from 1984 says LaserDisc Games
299680	301560	may be the wave of the future,
301560	303720	and drums up hype for Bluth's next game,
303720	305020	Space Ace.
305020	312360	♪♪
312360	314360	Space Ace was similarly great-looking,
314360	317060	though it was effectively the same game as its predecessor,
317060	319280	only with a different theme and new animations.
319280	321020	It's just as fun to watch,
321020	324140	but by the time of its release later in 1984, however,
324140	325400	that wasn't really enough.
325400	327360	The lack of gameplay in these games
327360	329180	had come back to haunt them in the market.
329180	330780	There wasn't much replay value.
330780	332780	Once you knew how to beat it, that was it.
332780	334640	This put an upper ceiling on how much a person
334640	335980	could go back and enjoy something,
335980	339020	when other games had many levels and increasing difficulty.
339020	341020	Players had grown tired of the style,
341020	343600	and arcade owners went into buying expensive game units
343600	345180	with temperamental discs inside them
345180	347440	that players could memorize and never play again.
347440	349100	What they want is variety.
349100	351400	We constantly get tired of one type of food
351400	353060	or one type of movie or one type of game,
353060	355680	and so as you progress, you want to go on to a new thing.
355680	357720	LaserDisc Games had proven to be more
357720	360180	the splash of the future than the wave,
360180	361680	and the tide had gone out.
362680	365800	I think I might have gone a little bit overboard
365800	367060	with the water metaphors.
367060	370100	So what if you wanted more of this type of game
370100	372720	or wanted to see what directions the genre explored
372720	373800	as time went on?
373800	375680	There've been a couple of revivals over the years,
375680	378440	like Braindead 13, which is probably straight up
378440	380600	the best example of this weird subgenre
380600	381680	of playable animation,
381680	383640	and there's also more weird cash-ins
383640	385520	from the original boom to go back and find,
385520	388340	like, uh, Time Gal or Ninja Hayate
388340	390760	or Super Don Quixote
390800	391800	or...
393560	395140	E-Esch's...
395140	396760	Au-runmiller.
396760	399840	If your timing is off, poor Don will die a hideous death.
399840	402060	Or Cliffhanger, which was actually made out
402060	404380	of recut footage from Lupin III films,
404380	406260	including Castle of Cagliostro.
406260	408720	So we technically got an arcade game
408720	410720	featuring animation by Hayao Miyazaki.
410720	412760	That's kind of mind-blowing.
412760	415260	Jump!
415260	418100	Jump!
418100	419840	It was clearly rushed incredibly quickly
419840	422220	to make it to market, so the dub is so atrocious
422220	425180	that you can actually make out the original Japanese voices
425180	426420	from the films underneath.
426420	427640	Clarisse!
427640	429800	Dragon's Lair's namesake earned it a good deal
429800	431180	of notoriety and nostalgia,
431180	433600	even as its format and imitators failed.
433600	435340	The game had several sequels
435340	436960	and has been repackaged many times
436960	439100	onto almost every imaginable console.
439100	441300	There was an Indiegogo campaign to fund a piece
441300	443560	designed to help fund a Dragon's Lair movie.
443560	446880	In other words, to take even what game there was
446880	448060	out of their game.
448060	449940	There's also a couple of different ports
449940	451100	that are actually new games,
451100	454060	including a famously ridiculously difficult NES version
454060	456320	of which I've never even beaten the first screen.
456320	458320	There's a rubbish SNES version of Space Ace,
458320	460060	but neither actually captures the thing
460060	462740	that made these games cool and unique at the time,
462740	464480	so they wouldn't be all that interesting
464480	465820	even if they were fun.
465820	467940	So if you're interested in tracking this genre
467940	469600	of fully animated adventure game,
469600	471700	there isn't that much to track.
471700	474940	But what if I told you there was an even more true successor
474940	478280	to Dragon's Lair than the hasty sequels or the cash-ins?
478280	480620	What if I told you there was a secret,
480620	483360	forgotten third game in the saga
483360	486440	of Dragon's Lair and Space Ace?
486440	487780	Ooh, saga.
487780	489580	That makes it sound important.
489580	493500	But first, a question everyone seems to take for granted.
493500	495400	Who made Dragon's Lair?
495400	498040	♪♪
498040	500040	When people think of Dragon's Lair,
500040	501900	they think of Don Bluth.
501900	503080	It's easy to see why.
503080	504400	Let's look at one of the posters.
504400	507580	Magicon presents a Don Bluth Studios production.
507580	509280	Design and animation, Don Bluth.
509280	510400	Produced by Don Bluth.
510400	511620	Directed by Don Bluth.
511620	513240	Copyright, Don Bluth.
513240	515580	Posters don't have to be arranged this way.
515580	517240	This is a purposeful choice.
517240	520280	It creates the impression that, like a modern-day Merlin,
520280	524000	Don Bluth assembled Dragon's Lair with his own two hands.
524000	525900	Geoffrey of Monmouth never left us.
525900	528120	He just became a marketing consultant.
528120	529500	The creator is Don Bluth,
529500	531540	who once directed several Disney features
531540	533200	in the mid-1970s.
533200	535340	Last year, Bluth found his own audience
535340	536960	with his first animated feature,
536960	538460	The Secret of NIMH.
538460	540960	You see, people tend to remember history
540960	542420	in terms of winners.
542420	544500	Secret of NIMH had been wildly successful
544500	545540	the previous year.
545540	547800	Don Bluth was swiftly becoming a household name,
547800	549760	and his legend about leaving Disney
549760	551720	and piling everything he had into NIMH,
551720	553720	even mortgaging his house to complete it,
553720	555180	and making it all back and more,
555180	556560	was compelling.
556560	558880	History likes people who gamble and win,
558880	560300	and history tends to only remember
560300	561760	whose name was on the poster.
561780	563660	History has a knack of not remembering
563660	565300	the hundreds of talented people
565300	566800	who worked on Secret of NIMH,
566800	568960	or the other animators behind Dragon's Lair,
568960	571620	or the programmers who made the system work at all,
571620	574500	or the man who actually made the game.
574500	579220	["The Idea of Turning Cartoons into Video Games"]
579220	581420	["was developed at Rick Dyer Industries."
582560	585560	["We're in the entertainment business."
585560	587060	Remember Rick Dyer?
587060	589140	Despite the game actually being conceived
589140	591640	and programmed by RDI Video Systems
591660	594520	and RDI being short for Rick Dyer Industries,
594520	596120	history appears to have conspired
596120	597860	to make sure people forget Dyer
597860	599500	and that the game was his idea
599500	602000	and that he'd had this idea for a long time.
602000	604160	["It's the forerunner of Dragon's Lair.
604160	608000	["It was developed way back in 1979."
608000	611000	["This was Dyer's first computerized interactive game."
611000	612960	Dyer had spent his youth making fantasy games
612960	615640	using text and pictures drawn onto cash register paper
615640	618220	programmed to scroll to the right point as he made choices.
618220	619920	When attempts to sell a digitized game
619920	621060	along these lines failed,
621060	622560	he decided that more animation
622560	624220	would create a better connection with the viewer
624220	625980	and started work on Dragon's Lair.
625980	628100	Later, he hired John Bluth's studio
628100	629940	to do the animation itself.
629940	631440	But despite his success,
631440	634660	Dyer was aware of the flaws with Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.
634660	637240	Firstly, he'd wanted people to be able to play them at home,
637240	638860	but arcades had become a necessity
638860	641320	given the expense of the technology required to play them.
641320	643460	Secondly, they were short and had limited scope
643460	645880	in terms of story or genuine decision-making.
645880	647620	Dyer had gotten into making games as a kid
647620	651660	because he liked to make big adventures with grand stories.
651660	654700	He wasn't happy with Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.
654700	656900	He wanted to make something bigger.
656900	661200	["I think right now the arcade industry is playing catch-up to us.
661200	666460	I know what's coming after the introduction of our home system."
666700	671700	["What I'm going to do is to create a world that is so real
671700	676700	and that you will have a hard time telling what's real and what isn't."
676700	679700	In late 1984, Dyer's company began work
679700	681700	on what he hoped would blow the lid off
681700	683960	of home gaming again after its collapse.
683960	685960	He was about to inaugurate a company
685960	687460	that would be able to produce games
687460	689460	that would be able to be played at home.
689460	691460	However, the company didn't have the funds
691460	693460	to produce the games it was going to produce.
694460	697460	The Halcyon was an incredibly ambitious system.
697460	699460	The name—designed to deliberately invoke
699460	703460	the name of Hal 9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey.
703460	705460	And no, that's not me being weird
705460	707460	and reading too much into it this time.
707460	709460	They really meant to invite that comparison.
709460	712460	["If you remember the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey,
712460	714460	there was a guy named Hal 9000,
714460	716460	and he was the one who came up with the name
716460	720460	of the game that was going to be released in 2001."
720460	723460	["If you remember the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey,
723460	726460	there was a computer in that movie called Hal."
726460	728460	Why you would make your console invoke the name
728460	730460	of an AI that goes mad and kills most of its crew,
730460	731460	I don't know.
731460	733460	I think you might have fallen asleep
733460	734460	halfway through the film.
734460	736460	For the time, it was ambitious,
736460	737460	the same way Dragon's Lair had been.
737460	739460	You could speak to Hal,
739460	740460	the name of the AI in the Halcyon,
740460	743460	and it could talk back to you and even remember your name.
743460	745460	["Good evening, Hal.
745460	747460	What do you want, Rick?"
747460	750460	What do you want, Rick?
750460	752460	It sounds so mad at him.
752460	754460	["Eight."
756460	759460	["That's my 847 spin."
759460	761460	["Disco."
765460	767460	["Maybe he's what a computer should have been,
767460	770460	all along, something that anybody can use
770460	772460	because anybody can talk."
772460	773460	Hang on.
773460	776460	Clearly, Rick Dyer's never been to Liverpool.
776460	778460	Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
778460	781460	Obviously, this is basic AI by modern standards,
781460	783460	but the idea of a home media device
783460	785460	you could talk to in 1984
785460	787460	before the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System
787460	789460	was even out in America or Europe
789460	791460	was kind of amazing.
791460	794460	["Visit worlds which were only dreams
794460	796460	before Halcyon,
796460	800460	like nothing you've experienced ever."
800460	802460	Here's Dyer demonstrating Hal
802460	805460	on a 1985 edition of the show Computer Chronicles.
805460	808460	["If I have your voice, friend,
808460	810460	please say your name."
810460	811460	["Stuart."
811460	815460	["Nice to see you again, Stuart Sheffy.
815460	817460	Can I call you Stuart?"
817460	819460	["Yes."
819460	821460	["Yes. Okay, Stuart."
821460	823460	And to launch with it, Dyer and his team
823460	825460	were working on a new game.
825460	827460	It was called Thayer's Quest.
827460	829460	["The game that comes with this is Thayer's Quest."
829460	831460	["This is a story about greed,
831460	834460	about unbridled ambition and powerlust
834460	837460	and the disaster resulting from those faults."
837460	839460	Thayer's Quest was gonna be more
839460	841460	than just a video file with button prompts.
841460	844460	Thayer's Quest was going to be an adventure.
844460	847460	["What we're creating is going to allow you
847460	850460	to be anything that you ever wanted to be
850460	851460	and experience it.
851460	852460	You're gonna be there.
852460	854460	You will live and die by your decisions."
854460	857460	A game where you choose where your character goes
857460	859460	on a journey across a world of five kingdoms
859460	862460	interacting with an all-new fantasy story.
862460	865460	["Unlike standard video games that demand quick reflexes,
865460	868460	the new project places a premium on thinking.
868460	871460	You talk to the computer, and it will talk back."
871460	872460	An adventure featuring animation
872460	875460	instead of just text or the day's primitive graphics,
875460	877460	utilizing Laserdisc technology once more,
877460	879460	but on a scale even more grand
879460	881460	than the game's spiritual predecessors
881460	884460	and doing it all in the player's own home.
884460	887460	["We're estimating that you'll be able to play the game
887460	889460	20 hours a week for six months
889460	892460	before you will have explored the entire world."
892460	894460	The price tag of this home Laserdisc player
894460	897460	slash games console slash talking AI computer?
897460	900460	$2,500.
900460	904460	That's nearly $6,000 in 2017 money,
904460	905460	which means that in the UK,
905460	908460	it would cost at least 400 pounds.
908460	911460	Laserdisc players were crazy expensive at the time,
911460	913460	but even that was pretty steep.
913460	915460	But hey, you could play an animated adventure quest
915460	917460	by talking to a computer.
917460	919460	["There has never been speech recognition
919460	921460	of the high caliber that this has."
921460	924460	Well, not really.
924460	926460	["Let's go to the forest clearing."
926460	927460	["One."
927460	928460	["What?"
928460	929460	["One."
929460	933460	["Speak consistently, Stuart."
933460	934460	["One."
934460	936460	["Sir?"
936460	937460	["Two."
937460	939460	["Two."
939460	941460	["Is that okay, I mean?"
941460	943460	You see, this was the 80s.
943460	946460	People had an idea of what the future was going to look like
946460	949460	without really knowing it or thinking about its practicalities.
949460	952460	The future is always different from how people of the present
952460	954460	think the future will be.
954460	956460	The Halcyon was ultimately a poor facsimile
956460	959460	of one man's best guess as to what the future would look like,
959460	962460	and it turned out not to be a very good guess.
962460	964460	Still, I really wanted to know what this device
964460	967460	was actually like to use and what Taya's quest played like,
967460	970460	so I decided to take a look on eBay and see if one popped up.
971460	973460	That was a year and a half ago.
973460	975460	So far, I've seen one go up
975460	978460	for $600 plus some hefty import fees.
978460	980460	Based on rumblings on other forums,
980460	983460	one tends to appear on eBay, perhaps even the same one,
983460	985460	every year or so.
985460	988460	While flyers advertising the Halcyon were circulated
988460	990460	and some stores even took pre-orders
990460	992460	and some salesmen were given copies
992460	994460	to demonstrate to potential customers,
994460	996460	it's actually up for debate
996460	999460	whether the Halcyon was ever officially released.
1000460	1002460	It's possible that this shot
1002460	1005460	contains every existing Halcyon.
1005460	1007460	As far as I can tell, no museums
1007460	1009460	have a Halcyon in their corridors,
1009460	1011460	except possibly the Video Game History Museum
1011460	1013460	in Frisco, Texas.
1013460	1015460	If I ever end up in Texas for some reason,
1015460	1017460	like, I don't know, my plane crashes,
1017460	1019460	I'll head there and see if they've got it.
1019460	1021460	So the Halcyon was a failure.
1021460	1023460	It didn't sell very well.
1023460	1025460	In fact, it arguably didn't sell very well
1025460	1027460	because it didn't sell very well.
1027460	1029460	In fact, it arguably didn't actually make it
1029460	1031460	to the stores in a way people could buy,
1031460	1033460	and the company went bankrupt pretty soon after,
1033460	1035460	but that's not the end of Teya's quest.
1035460	1037460	When the company started to go under,
1037460	1039460	they started selling conversion kits
1039460	1041460	for Dragon's Lair arcade cabinets.
1041460	1043460	It's hard to tell how well those sold either,
1043460	1045460	but Laserdiscs, marquees, instruction manuals,
1045460	1048460	and EEPROM chips from the game are floating around on eBay,
1048460	1050460	so there's probably at least a few.
1050460	1052460	I've heard tell of the arcade version
1052460	1054460	appearing at conventions and some other gaming events.
1054460	1056460	It's still pretty rare, though,
1057460	1059460	never mind if you'd be able to get together
1059460	1061460	the technology to actually play them.
1061460	1063460	Wait. What's this?
1063460	1065460	Teya's Quest? On...
1065460	1067460	CD-ROM?
1067460	1069460	From Canada?
1069460	1071460	For only 19.94 Canadian US dollars?
1071460	1073460	I mean...
1073460	1075460	I had to.
1075460	1077460	Didn't I? I had to.
1077460	1079460	I needed to know.
1079460	1081460	Ah, and here we are.
1081460	1083460	Is it in the shot?
1083460	1085460	Okay, great, yeah.
1086460	1088460	...on a disc
1088460	1090460	far smaller than it was ever designed for.
1090460	1092460	This disc was printed in 2005,
1092460	1094460	over 20 years
1094460	1096460	after it was originally made,
1096460	1098460	and that means it's another 12 years old
1098460	1100460	on top of that.
1100460	1102460	The latest system requirements
1102460	1104460	that it recommends what operating system you can use
1104460	1106460	is Windows XP.
1106460	1109460	God, do you remember those days when that was the fastest operating system?
1109460	1111460	This...
1111460	1113460	Just...
1113460	1115460	God, it even smells of Windows XP.
1115460	1117460	Like...
1117460	1119460	a very old, new car smell
1119460	1121460	and just the beginning of dust.
1121460	1123460	Ah, it's beautiful.
1123460	1125460	It's like a time capsule.
1125460	1127460	Thanks, Canada.
1127460	1129460	Hey, according to this Digital Leisure put this out,
1129460	1131460	you might remember them as the people
1131460	1133460	who did some PlayStation Home, like, casino games
1133460	1135460	that were pretty popular,
1135460	1137460	and then when PlayStation Home closed,
1137460	1139460	I think they're moving them to Steam.
1139460	1141460	And then before... Oh, wait!
1141460	1143460	They did the re-releases of, uh,
1143460	1145460	Dragon's Lair and the sequel to that
1145460	1147460	and, uh, Space Ace, didn't they?
1147460	1149460	So it makes sense that they would do this.
1149460	1151460	Did they also do Mad Dog McCree
1151460	1153460	and Space Pirates?
1153460	1155460	Space Pirates is, like,
1155460	1157460	a game only I seem to remember whenever I bring it up.
1157460	1159460	I hope I'm not imagining that game.
1159460	1161460	Anyway, let's close the loop on all this
1161460	1163460	and actually give this game a look, shall we?
1163460	1168460	♪♪
1168460	1170460	In a traditional fantasy land,
1170460	1172460	the bad wizard man thing,
1172460	1174460	Saucerball, has killed almost all
1174460	1176460	of the Elder Kings
1176460	1178460	and is going to take over the world.
1178460	1180460	The last in the Elder Kings line is the player character,
1180460	1183460	Téa Alkenred.
1183460	1185460	His wizard mentor, Droos,
1185460	1187460	wants him to gather the five artifacts
1187460	1189460	that form an amulet called the Hand
1189460	1191460	made by another wizard
1191460	1194460	named Kwoad in order to beat Saucerball.
1194460	1196460	Kwoad is gone,
1196460	1199460	but the one who will come remains.
1199460	1201460	I am ready.
1201460	1203460	But before Droos will send him on his quest,
1203460	1205460	he gives him a final test.
1205460	1207460	That rhymed. That was weird.
1207460	1210460	♪♪
1210460	1213460	Téa, choose an exit quickly
1213460	1215460	or fail this test of magic.
1215460	1217460	You have to choose the left door
1217460	1219460	or the right door.
1220460	1222460	You have failed, Téa.
1222460	1224460	You're dead. You're just dead.
1224460	1227460	Your mentor's test kills you immediately
1227460	1229460	if you choose the wrong door,
1229460	1231460	and he's supposed to be the good guy.
1231460	1233460	Anyway, if you get it right, he gives you a pouch
1233460	1235460	with your first three items, single-use spells,
1235460	1237460	which are the solution to three puzzles in the game,
1237460	1239460	and then you get to go out into the world.
1239460	1242460	I have tried 22 apprentices over the years,
1242460	1244460	and they have all died.
1244460	1246460	I bet right now Téa's thinking,
1246460	1248460	yeah, and how many of those did you kill
1248460	1250460	by sending to the ticking clock,
1250460	1252460	flying symbol, fantasy zone?
1252460	1254460	The game does diverge in gameplay
1254460	1256460	from its predecessors in a kind of significant way.
1256460	1258460	You actually choose places to go
1258460	1260460	and what items to use,
1260460	1262460	and take your time to make decisions.
1262460	1264460	You're no longer hitting buttons to not die
1264460	1266460	while traversing a linear path.
1266460	1268460	It's incredibly simplistic, though.
1268460	1270460	A lot of choices amount to picking one
1270460	1272460	and hoping it's not the one that kills you,
1272460	1274460	like with the two doors,
1274460	1276460	or perhaps, to be a bit more accurate,
1276460	1278460	a choose-your-own-adventure book,
1278460	1280460	like Warlock of Firetop Mountain
1280460	1282460	or Creature of Havoc
1282460	1284460	or the Goosebumps ones.
1284460	1286460	You choose where to go from a list
1286460	1288460	with a mouse in this version
1288460	1290460	instead of saying a number out loud, sadly,
1290460	1292460	and sometimes you use an item.
1292460	1294460	It's very trial and error.
1294460	1296460	For example, at this point,
1296460	1298460	a lady gives you this advice.
1298460	1300460	...which burns on the marshways
1300460	1302460	can destroy the landwares.
1302460	1304460	What's a landware?
1304460	1306460	How is this advice useful to a player?
1306460	1308460	It's a made-up word.
1308460	1310460	Then at one point later on,
1310460	1312460	these ghosts attack you, and then you get one chance
1312460	1314460	to use an item, and you die if it's the wrong item.
1314460	1316460	Well, guess what?
1316460	1318460	These are the landwares,
1318460	1320460	and you need to have gone to a place
1320460	1322460	that's covered in fire
1322460	1324460	and click on it
1324460	1326460	to then realize it's cold fire
1326460	1328460	so that you take some and then put it in your bag
1328460	1330460	first, and then you use it here
1330460	1332460	to kill the landwares and progress.
1332460	1334460	And yeah, the game lets you use the scrolls
1334460	1336460	in places where they don't solve the puzzle
1336460	1338460	they're made for, and they're just gone.
1338460	1340460	You can waste a scroll on the landwares
1340460	1342460	if you think that's what you're supposed to use,
1342460	1344460	and they even have it so they don't kill you
1344460	1346460	for trying, even though you can't progress
1346460	1348460	at this point because you can no longer
1348460	1350460	pick up this crystal without exploding
1350460	1352460	because you needed the scroll of release.
1352460	1354460	The art and animation isn't nearly as good
1354460	1356460	as in Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.
1356460	1358460	It looks okay, but it was quite clearly rushed.
1358460	1360460	The game keeps finding excuses
1360460	1362460	to not have to lip-sync anyone's mouths.
1385460	1387460	Are you the people of the dunes?
1387460	1389460	I mean no harm to you.
1397460	1399460	There are different voice lines for coming back
1399460	1401460	to some areas more than once, which means
1401460	1403460	the animation with no clear mouth movement can be easily
1403460	1405460	reused. I think this is why they did it,
1405460	1407460	but it just means the whole game looks
1407460	1409460	less good at the expense of being reusable.
1410460	1412460	What? You again?
1412460	1414460	What? You again?
1414460	1416460	Overall, it's a lot less dynamic
1416460	1418460	or fantastical than the other games,
1418460	1420460	but since it relies more on decision-making
1420460	1422460	than quick reflexes, I can understand the visual change.
1422460	1424460	Some of the deaths are still pretty funny.
1427460	1429460	This might just be
1429460	1431460	the only game in history
1431460	1433460	where you can be killed by wheat.
1433460	1435460	Also, the voice acting's pretty good, isn't it?
1435460	1437460	Apart from after you kill
1437460	1439460	the False King Torlok—remember that name,
1439460	1441460	by the way—one of his guards has this to say.
1443460	1445460	I'm sorry. I had no choice.
1445460	1447460	For ten years I've waited to see this.
1447460	1449460	Thank you, friend!
1449460	1451460	Nothing says welcome to a realm
1451460	1453460	of fantasy and adventure quite like
1453460	1455460	Kermit the Frog.
1455460	1457460	This version is basically just a bunch of video files
1457460	1459460	playing in a custom video player.
1459460	1461460	If you check the disc's files, even the inventory screens
1461460	1463460	are just .mpegs on a loop.
1463460	1465460	It's almost clever how they managed to get the old game
1465460	1467460	together on a new system, but it's also
1467460	1469460	a reminder that the game you're playing is literally
1469460	1471460	just a collection of interlocking menus,
1471460	1473460	like the weird bonus games they used to put on
1473460	1475460	early DVD releases of films.
1475460	1477460	Anyway, after a bit over 30 minutes of trial
1477460	1479460	and error—somewhat less than the
1479460	1481460	month's dire predicted—I had
1481460	1483460	three artifacts and reached the bridge to the fourth
1483460	1485460	kingdom, The Far Reaches.
1485460	1487460	Pass and be warned
1487460	1489460	that the southern barbarians roam
1489460	1491460	The Far Reaches.
1491460	1493460	It is a lawless kingdom now.
1495460	1497460	Wha—wait, what?
1497460	1499460	You have beaten Téa's Quest?
1499460	1501460	More challenges await you in Shadowin?
1501460	1503460	The sequel to Téa's—
1503460	1505460	what? The game ends with a trailer
1505460	1507460	for a game called Kingdom Shadowin.
1507460	1509460	Why does the main character look so different?
1509460	1511460	How is there a sequel to a
1511460	1513460	game no one played on a console
1513460	1515460	that no one bought? How did
1515460	1517460	playing this game only give me more questions?
1517460	1519460	Wh—what?
1519460	1521460	♪♪
1521460	1523460	Okay.
1523460	1525460	It turns out there's one more
1525460	1527460	twist in the tale of Téa's Quest.
1527460	1529460	There's also the twist that it's
1529460	1531460	pronounced Théa's Quest,
1531460	1533460	but it's too late to re-record
1533460	1535460	all the voiceover, so...
1535460	1537460	The game was either left unfinished or intended to be
1537460	1539460	the first part in a series released hastily
1539460	1541460	to try to recoup costs for it in the Halcyon,
1541460	1543460	with plans to make a sequel before the company
1543460	1545460	went bankrupt and the whole endeavor was scrapped.
1545460	1547460	While this 2005 CD
1547460	1549460	is a close to faithful version of the
1549460	1551460	original audio and video of the arcade version,
1551460	1553460	and also there's a DVD version released
1553460	1555460	at the same time just for DVD players
1555460	1557460	and there's some more behind-the-scenes footage on it,
1557460	1559460	a decade prior, in 1995,
1559460	1561460	ten years before this version
1561460	1563460	and ten years after the original release,
1563460	1565460	the game was ported to the 3DO,
1565460	1567460	the CDI, and DOS PCs
1567460	1569460	under the name Kingdom the Far
1569460	1571460	Reaches. The CDI and
1571460	1573460	3DO are basically considered critical and
1573460	1575460	commercial failures, but this is perhaps
1575460	1577460	the one context where I can't make fun of
1577460	1579460	them, because even there a step up from the game's
1579460	1581460	previous release on a console that never
1581460	1583460	even officially came out.
1583460	1585460	God, I feel kind of sorry for Rick Dyer.
1585460	1587460	The poor guy kept trying, and it
1587460	1589460	kept just not quite working out.
1589460	1591460	This version of the game is the one that got the sequel,
1591460	1593460	Kingdom Shadowun, released a year later
1593460	1595460	for the same consoles.
1595460	1597460	Some versions of Kingdom Part 2
1597460	1599460	Shadowun are just called Shadowun
1599460	1601460	for some reason. I also picked up a
1601460	1603460	copy of Kingdom Book 1 the Far Reaches
1603460	1605460	just to see what changes they made apart
1605460	1607460	from the title. Let's check that out real quick.
1607460	1609460	You comin' with me, boy?
1609460	1611460	This version uses more compressed graphics,
1611460	1613460	but also makes a bunch of weird changes.
1613460	1615460	Along with the title, a bunch of character
1615460	1617460	names have changed, too. The Elder Kings
1617460	1619460	are now the Argent Kings,
1619460	1621460	Téa Alkenred is now Lathan
1621460	1623460	Kandor, Druce is now
1623460	1625460	Daelin, Quode is now
1625460	1627460	Mobus, and Saucerball is
1627460	1629460	now Torlok.
1629460	1631460	Torlok has become Drake's Blood
1631460	1633460	the Wicked. Obviously, this means the voice
1633460	1635460	acting had to be redone by new actors,
1635460	1637460	and by actors, I mean whoever Rick Dyer
1637460	1639460	got to program this new version got into
1639460	1641460	a vocal booth for, like, five minutes.
1641460	1643460	Mobus is gone, but the
1643460	1645460	one who will come remains.
1645460	1647460	I am ready.
1647460	1649460	I can't verify the quote,
1649460	1651460	but apparently Dyer thought
1651460	1653460	the original names were
1653460	1655460	270s, so he changed them.
1655460	1657460	I don't think the names were the problem
1657460	1659460	with the original's release. It was probably
1659460	1661460	everything else. I can almost
1661460	1663460	see Dyer in my head trying his very best
1663460	1665460	to step as far as possible
1665460	1667460	away from the game's previous incarnation,
1667460	1669460	given its, frankly, traumatic history.
1669460	1671460	The opening sequence is now an optional
1671460	1673460	cutscene triggered at the beginning, which
1673460	1675460	ends before Druce—sorry, Daelin
1675460	1677460	makes you do the stupid bit with the doors.
1677460	1679460	When you start the game, you get a piece of all-new
1679460	1681460	animation, which looks kind of bad,
1681460	1683460	in which Téa—sorry, Lathan
1683460	1685460	gets told by Daelin about Drake's
1685460	1687460	blood seizing the throne and how you need three
1687460	1689460	artifacts to stop him. This is an interesting
1689460	1691460	change. The original game ended
1691460	1693460	suddenly partway through, and this
1693460	1695460	cutscene basically rewrites the entire plot
1695460	1697460	to be about doing the thing you
1697460	1699460	actually end up doing towards the end of the
1699460	1701460	actual amount of game they made.
1701460	1703460	Too much of the game's dialogue references the evil
1703460	1705460	wizard at the beginning, and he still appears in the game
1705460	1707460	to attack you, so they couldn't take
1707460	1709460	him out entirely. It's so weird
1709460	1711460	to have one opening talk about the evil wizard
1711460	1713460	who's now called Torlok, and then the
1713460	1715460	actual opening tells you your quest is to stop
1715460	1717460	a different bad guy who isn't called
1717460	1719460	Torlok anymore. Like everything
1719460	1721460	else about the legacy of this game, it's weird
1721460	1723460	and esoteric for seemingly no reason.
1723460	1725460	Even the name is weird. The Far
1725460	1727460	Reaches is one of the two kingdoms from the
1727460	1729460	original you don't end up going to
1729460	1731460	because the game ends on the bridge to visit them.
1731460	1733460	Why is this version called Kingdom
1733460	1735460	The Far Reaches when there's no
1735460	1737460	Far Reaches in it, and there's technically
1737460	1739460	five kingdoms? That's a plural
1739460	1741460	amount of kingdoms. I—I
1741460	1743460	wish I hadn't noticed this. It's just frustrating.
1743460	1745460	The gameplay is a bit different, too.
1745460	1747460	You now click around a map screen to decide where
1747460	1749460	to go. The first place you go is Dalen's
1749460	1751460	mansion, where the cutscene from going through
1751460	1753460	the correct door in the original just sort of
1753460	1755460	plays as if you just walked in, and he
1755460	1757460	gives you the scrolls. They also added more
1757460	1759460	complex puzzles. For example, this guy who just
1759460	1761460	talks to you in the first game is now blind,
1761460	1763460	and you get a scroll of seeing from Dalen
1763460	1765460	to use to get his advice. Dalen
1765460	1767460	also asks you which scrolls you want him to work
1767460	1769460	on next, so you actually get to make a couple
1769460	1771460	more choices than in the original, and the
1771460	1773460	use of a main map screen actually makes it feel like
1773460	1775460	you're traveling a world. Kind of.
1775460	1777460	Slightly. A little bit.
1777460	1779460	My son was your age
1779460	1781460	when he learned that the cold fire which
1781460	1783460	burns on the marsh waste can
1783460	1785460	destroy the mist monsters.
1785460	1787460	They call the land wares the mist
1787460	1789460	monsters in this version. It's like
1789460	1791460	Daya actually got my memo. Now
1791460	1793460	the puzzle is decipherable
1793460	1795460	by humans. Once you save
1795460	1797460	the princess, you get the second new cutscene
1797460	1799460	that's clearly new animation, where the princess
1799460	1801460	says thanks and invites you to stay.
1801460	1803460	I accept your gracious offer, princess.
1803460	1805460	Then,
1805460	1807460	together, they
1807460	1809460	invent fireworks.
1809460	1811460	Also, there's this really rocking
1811460	1813460	track that plays when it's trying to load the credits.
1819460	1821460	I think I want this as my new ringtone.
1821460	1823460	And the credits roll, and the game ends with the trailer for Shadowin.
1823460	1825460	So now, after covering
1825460	1827460	this new version of the game, we can actually
1827460	1829460	talk about its sequel. Its animation
1829460	1831460	style has been altered significantly, and the character
1831460	1833460	looks completely different. I have a feeling
1833460	1835460	Daya and co. wanted to further differentiate
1835460	1837460	Kingdom from Teya's Quest, and
1837460	1839460	did so by changing how everything looked when the
1839460	1841460	time came to make new animation for this sequel.
1841460	1843460	Or maybe he just had different animators
1843460	1845460	at this point. At this point, they probably either
1845460	1847460	moved on to bigger projects, or quit
1847460	1849460	and become a baker. Working as an
1849460	1851460	animator's really hard at the best of times, and
1851460	1853460	working on Teya's Quest seemed like it was a nightmare.
1853460	1855460	The sequel is basically just more
1855460	1857460	of the sort of gameplay from the previous game.
1857460	1859460	You get the other two relics, and finally,
1859460	1861460	after over a decade of waiting,
1861460	1863460	you get to kill Torlok.
1871460	1873460	Oh, come on. That was it? And then
1873460	1875460	Lathan kisses the princess from the first game,
1875460	1877460	and fireworks go off again, but there's more this time.
1877460	1879460	And credits.
1879460	1885460	Where do we go from around every turn?
1893460	1895460	Why did I make this?
1897460	1899460	Well, maybe
1899460	1901460	because it's an interesting story.
1901460	1903460	An immensely popular game that went away
1903460	1905460	so quickly that its successor was all but forgotten.
1905460	1907460	A recklessly optimistic
1907460	1909460	console in a period when home gaming
1909460	1911460	was hemorrhaging money that never even made it out the
1911460	1913460	door, and a relentless barrage
1913460	1915460	of unpronounceable names.
1915460	1917460	In June, this warehouse will come to life.
1917460	1919460	The new home video system that Rick and Jan
1919460	1921460	Dyer have banked everything on will be shipped
1921460	1923460	from here. My wife and I, as you probably
1923460	1925460	can guess, are gambling everything
1925460	1927460	we own on this, so
1927460	1929460	it's kind of scary,
1929460	1931460	but that's the sort of thing that makes you want to
1931460	1933460	succeed. Rick and his wife threw
1933460	1935460	everything they had into Halcyon,
1935460	1937460	and Halcyon took it all, took
1937460	1939460	everything, and then it was gone,
1939460	1941460	leaving them as barely a footnote
1941460	1943460	in the history of video games. Maybe
1943460	1945460	it's because I think Don Bluth is overrated,
1945460	1947460	and I find his continued attempts to revive
1947460	1949460	Dragon's Lair to be a little bit crass,
1949460	1951460	and wanted to talk about the game's actual creator
1951460	1953460	instead of the man who keeps getting the credit.
1953460	1955460	If you type Rick Dyer into
1955460	1957460	Wikipedia, you get a disambiguation
1957460	1959460	page linking to two possible
1959460	1961460	notable Rick Dyers. One of them is
1961460	1963460	ours, the video game designer. His
1963460	1965460	page is three short paragraphs
1965460	1967460	in length. The second is titled
1967460	1969460	Rick Dyer, and then in brackets,
1969460	1971460	Bigfoot.
1971460	1973460	Some guy who spread Bigfoot hoaxes
1973460	1975460	is remembered in more detail
1975460	1977460	than the inventor of Dragon's Lair.
1977460	1979460	Or maybe it's because the way
1979460	1981460	modern gaming's going right now, I'm a little
1981460	1983460	bit worried. The marketplace is only
1983460	1985460	getting bigger, and the tools of game
1985460	1987460	creation are more available than ever before,
1987460	1989460	and that means there's a lot more games competing
1989460	1991460	for people's attention. There may not be
1991460	1993460	another crash, but it's still a very
1993460	1995460	big pool for a small fish.
1995460	1997460	In any creative medium, it's scary
1997460	1999460	to work knowing that what you create
1999460	2001460	may only exist in permanent obscurity.
2001460	2003460	The people who make it might be talented,
2003460	2005460	but increasingly, they're also very
2005460	2007460	lucky. Undertale got recognized
2007460	2009460	because Toby Fox was in the right place at the
2009460	2011460	right time with an already existing following
2011460	2013460	around his Homestuck music. Dragon's Lair
2013460	2015460	did well partially on the back of that name
2015460	2017460	they put all over it. The next designer with
2017460	2019460	the talent Toby Fox had
2019460	2021460	might not be so lucky.
2021460	2023460	The ancient Romans used to tell the story of a man
2023460	2025460	called Romulus, a fantastical
2025460	2027460	figure descended from royalty,
2027460	2029460	raised by wolves who took part in all
2029460	2031460	the most important foundational
2031460	2033460	events in Roman history, and
2033460	2035460	named Rome after himself.
2035460	2037460	The Romans looked at their society and liked to
2037460	2039460	imagine that it had all been the plan
2039460	2041460	of some great genius.
2041460	2043460	The Romans believed in dozens of
2043460	2045460	mythical engines of creation.
2045460	2047460	What was one more?
2047460	2049460	Hundreds of incredible works of art have been done of
2049460	2051460	epic historical events, huge
2051460	2053460	important moments in history,
2053460	2055460	the actions of gods or supposed
2055460	2057460	men like Romulus.
2057460	2059460	One of my favorite paintings is The Lacemaker.
2059460	2061460	Johan Vermeer painted a
2061460	2063460	loving, accurate, and detailed rendition
2063460	2065460	of a girl making
2065460	2067460	lace. Vermeer celebrated
2067460	2069460	real people doing ordinary
2069460	2071460	things. He offered the
2071460	2073460	radical idea that you didn't have to be
2073460	2075460	special or important or magical
2075460	2077460	or legendary to be worth
2077460	2079460	being painted or thought about
2079460	2081460	or remembered. So it turns out
2081460	2083460	there are two ways of explaining history.
2083460	2085460	We can be like Geoffrey of Monmouth or the
2085460	2087460	early Romans and invent these
2087460	2089460	magical, wondrous, brilliant people
2089460	2091460	who gave everything to us.
2091460	2093460	A wizard made Stonehenge all by himself.
2093460	2095460	A man called Romulus
2095460	2097460	invented Rome out of whole cloth
2097460	2099460	and took part in every major historical
2099460	2101460	event required to fulfill his
2101460	2103460	amazing design.
2103460	2105460	John Bluth made Dragon's Lair.
2105460	2107460	Or we can be like Vermeer.
2107460	2109460	A bunch of ordinary,
2109460	2111460	everyday people built Stonehenge just by
2111460	2113460	working together and putting time and effort
2113460	2115460	into it. A bunch of ordinary
2115460	2117460	people make video games by working
2117460	2119460	together very hard for hours and hours
2119460	2121460	and hours and days and years to make
2121460	2123460	it. A bunch of regular, ordinary
2123460	2125460	people built Rome over the span of a
2125460	2127460	very long time, contributing
2127460	2129460	to what would later be remembered as the
2129460	2131460	exploits of one man. This way is
2131460	2133460	nowhere near as magical as the ones we like to
2133460	2135460	imagine put our world together.
2135460	2137460	The truth is often very mundane.
2137460	2139460	But maybe that's okay.
2147460	2149460	We're pioneers.
2149460	2151460	We're doing something that's never been done.
2151460	2153460	We have artists, we have writers, we have engineers,
2153460	2155460	we have technicians.
2155460	2157460	They're all working together and that has never
2157460	2159460	existed before. There's never really been a reason
2159460	2161460	for those three groups
2161460	2163460	to all coexist simultaneously.
2163460	2165460	What we're really
2165460	2167460	doing is combining art with science.
2167460	2169460	I think there's something sad but
2169460	2171460	beautiful about Rick Dyer and his dreams
2171460	2173460	of Halcyon. He calls himself
2173460	2175460	and his team pioneers in this news
2175460	2177460	broadcast, and the truth is
2177460	2179460	he's right. Pioneer
2179460	2181460	isn't an inherently positive term.
2181460	2183460	It just means you were among the first to explore
2183460	2185460	something, and that doesn't mean you were successful
2185460	2187460	or right. A lot of early pioneers
2187460	2189460	didn't make it back, and a lot
2189460	2191460	of people, a lot of us,
2191460	2193460	are going to end up more like Rick Dyer
2193460	2195460	than we'd hoped to be. So if we
2195460	2197460	can't learn to love and remember people like
2197460	2199460	Rick, we're condemning ourselves
2199460	2201460	in turn to be forgotten.
2201460	2203460	Your work might not
2203460	2205460	reach the audience it deserved, or you
2205460	2207460	might not make something anyone likes,
2207460	2209460	and it can be soul-crushing to embark on
2209460	2211460	a journey knowing you might not succeed.
2211460	2213460	But if we can learn to accept
2213460	2215460	that it's okay to try and fail,
2215460	2217460	and that people who fail are worth being remembered
2217460	2219460	and appreciated, then maybe we can
2219460	2221460	all at least learn to enjoy
2221460	2223460	the humanizing experience of failure
2223460	2225460	together.
2225460	2227460	Thank you for watching.
2239460	2241460	This video was quite a lot
2241460	2243460	of time in the making, and I can only do things
2243460	2245460	like this with the support I receive through Patreon,
2245460	2247460	so I'd like to thank my supporters very much.
2247460	2249460	In addition to the names scrolling
2249460	2251460	past the screen right now, I'd especially
2251460	2253460	like to thank...
