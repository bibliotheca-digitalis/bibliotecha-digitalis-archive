00:00.000 --> 00:08.780
In the middle of Wiltshire lies a ring of large standing stones, each weighing around 25 tons.

00:08.780 --> 00:13.120
It is believed the monument was assembled between 4,000 or 5,000 years ago.

00:13.120 --> 00:18.540
Archaeological evidence suggests it may have been a burial site or perhaps a place of healing where the injured were taken.

00:18.540 --> 00:22.380
Some also theorize it may have had a religious or astronomical importance.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.780
We call this place Stonehenge.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.880
We also call it a monument, but we don't even know if its creators would think such a thing.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.640
The culture that produced it left no written records, and even how it was built is still up for debate.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.340
In 1136, in his book, The History of the Kings of Britain,

00:37.340 --> 00:42.800
Geoffrey of Monmouth, an early British historiographer, claimed the wizard Merlin built Stonehenge.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.220
Here's an illustration from the mid-14th century based on that theory.

00:46.220 --> 00:50.880
For roughly 500 years, building something like Stonehenge seemed so difficult

00:50.880 --> 00:53.420
that it was commonly accepted that a wizard did it.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.880
Apparently, he did it with his bare hands, too.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.260
Thanks, Geoffrey!

00:57.260 --> 01:02.020
It's a mysterious place because it provides us with questions and no real answers.

01:02.020 --> 01:06.300
What was the intent of its creators? What did they think of it, and what became of them?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.980
What would a Britain built by these people look like?

01:08.980 --> 01:13.020
The so-called monument points away to a version of the world that never came to be.

01:13.020 --> 01:18.680
Instead, it's one of the sole creations of a culture whose ideas and intent have simply vanished.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.640
Will we ever really know who built Stonehenge, or what it was for?

01:24.100 --> 01:25.340
Probably not.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.260
And besides, it's just a bunch of rocks.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.420
Anyway, today we're going to talk about Dragonslayer.

01:55.340 --> 02:00.340
You play as a police mouse, who has to take back stolen goods from a gang of cats

02:00.340 --> 02:04.060
by bouncing around in a weird void with random objects in it.

02:04.060 --> 02:07.100
You can't really tell those pinky-purply things are cats,

02:07.100 --> 02:11.600
and also, one would question the ability of a police captain who sent a mouse with no backup

02:11.600 --> 02:14.020
to confiscate stolen goods from an army of cats,

02:14.020 --> 02:16.180
but, you know, it's a pretty simple game.

02:16.180 --> 02:20.340
It's a game where you have to play as a mouse, and it's a game where you have to play as a cat.

02:20.340 --> 02:25.020
...police captain who sent a mouse with no backup to confiscate stolen goods from an army of cats,

02:25.020 --> 02:26.560
but it's fine enough.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.220
On June 14th, Mario Brothers hit arcades.

02:29.220 --> 02:32.600
This was the first appearance of Mario's brother, Luigi.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.760
Oh boy, I'm so happy to meet Mario, but with different colors.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.220
Together, up to two players can jump around in a hellish void

02:39.220 --> 02:42.100
knocking pixelated facsimiles of turtles around.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.800
I mean, both of these games are fun to play,

02:43.800 --> 02:48.880
but visually speaking, they're pretty poor appropriations of the thing the player's told they're doing.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.720
I'm telling you all this so you can maybe imagine the impact when,

02:51.720 --> 02:53.460
on June 19th that year,

02:53.460 --> 02:58.720
just five days after Mario Brothers told you this mass of colors was a man called Luigi,

02:58.720 --> 02:59.720
this happened.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.560
["Dragon's Lair"]

03:03.560 --> 03:07.640
["Dragon's Lair." You control the actions of a daring adventurer

03:07.640 --> 03:10.600
finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard."

03:10.600 --> 03:12.520
Hey, look! It's an actual person

03:12.520 --> 03:16.520
who is trying to not die in an actual dungeon-looking place,

03:16.520 --> 03:17.940
and look how much animation there is!

03:17.960 --> 03:21.340
Look at the actual capital-A animation!

03:21.340 --> 03:27.020
And if we look closely enough, we can even, maybe, see a game in here somewhere.

03:27.020 --> 03:29.060
The mechanics of the game are very simplistic.

03:29.060 --> 03:32.480
You watch the pretty impressively animated character make his way through a room,

03:32.480 --> 03:35.060
and then press one of four directions or the attack button

03:35.060 --> 03:37.140
when it's appropriate to do one of those things,

03:37.140 --> 03:40.400
and if you do the wrong thing, you lose a life and get to watch a death animation.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.560
And to store all the data for those animations,

03:42.560 --> 03:46.360
the arcade game used a revolutionary content distribution system for the time

03:46.360 --> 03:48.320
called a Laserdisc.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.060
Ow!

03:49.060 --> 03:51.100
Laserdiscs had been in use since the late 70s,

03:51.100 --> 03:54.980
but the idea of using one of these as a way of storing more picture and sound information

03:54.980 --> 03:58.780
than a normal arcade game could use hadn't been implemented in many games at this point.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.820
This game was designed by Don Bluth, former Disney animator,

04:01.820 --> 04:04.320
and Rick Dyer—forget about this guy, you'll never hear from him again,

04:04.320 --> 04:05.600
let's just talk about Don Bluth some more—

04:05.600 --> 04:09.600
he'd just made The Secret of NIMH, one of the best-looking animated films ever,

04:09.600 --> 04:11.740
and was about to go on to make Rock-a-Doodle,

04:11.740 --> 04:12.740
Thumbelina,

04:12.740 --> 04:14.240
A Troll in Central Park,

04:14.240 --> 04:15.600
The Pebble and the Penguin,

04:15.640 --> 04:16.800
Titan A.E.,

04:16.800 --> 04:18.800
and also some good films.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.440
I never saw any of the good ones growing up, um, so...

04:21.440 --> 04:24.020
Bluth and his small team used their animation chops

04:24.020 --> 04:28.020
to create an actually nice-looking game with dynamism and charm.

04:28.020 --> 04:30.360
The game looked amazing, and everyone knew it.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.520
Even though it was more expensive to play than other games,

04:32.520 --> 04:34.100
they had huge lines at arcades,

04:34.100 --> 04:35.640
and the machine sold amazingly,

04:35.640 --> 04:37.640
with arcade producers partially thanking it

04:37.640 --> 04:40.400
for getting them through a financially difficult time in history.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.100
And I do mean difficult.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.260
Outside of arcades, what would later be called

04:44.260 --> 04:48.180
the Great Video Game Crash of 1983 was happening.

04:48.180 --> 04:51.940
The revenues of home game sales dropped almost 97%,

04:51.940 --> 04:54.100
but Dragon's Lair and its appealing gimmick

04:54.100 --> 04:57.020
had somewhat insulated arcades from these troubles.

04:57.020 --> 04:59.680
This article from 1984 says LaserDisc Games

04:59.680 --> 05:01.560
may be the wave of the future,

05:01.560 --> 05:03.720
and drums up hype for Bluth's next game,

05:03.720 --> 05:05.020
Space Ace.

05:05.020 --> 05:12.360
♪♪

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
Space Ace was similarly great-looking,

05:14.360 --> 05:17.060
though it was effectively the same game as its predecessor,

05:17.060 --> 05:19.280
only with a different theme and new animations.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.020
It's just as fun to watch,

05:21.020 --> 05:24.140
but by the time of its release later in 1984, however,

05:24.140 --> 05:25.400
that wasn't really enough.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.360
The lack of gameplay in these games

05:27.360 --> 05:29.180
had come back to haunt them in the market.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.780
There wasn't much replay value.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.780
Once you knew how to beat it, that was it.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.640
This put an upper ceiling on how much a person

05:34.640 --> 05:35.980
could go back and enjoy something,

05:35.980 --> 05:39.020
when other games had many levels and increasing difficulty.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.020
Players had grown tired of the style,

05:41.020 --> 05:43.600
and arcade owners went into buying expensive game units

05:43.600 --> 05:45.180
with temperamental discs inside them

05:45.180 --> 05:47.440
that players could memorize and never play again.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.100
What they want is variety.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.400
We constantly get tired of one type of food

05:51.400 --> 05:53.060
or one type of movie or one type of game,

05:53.060 --> 05:55.680
and so as you progress, you want to go on to a new thing.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.720
LaserDisc Games had proven to be more

05:57.720 --> 06:00.180
the splash of the future than the wave,

06:00.180 --> 06:01.680
and the tide had gone out.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.800
I think I might have gone a little bit overboard

06:05.800 --> 06:07.060
with the water metaphors.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.100
So what if you wanted more of this type of game

06:10.100 --> 06:12.720
or wanted to see what directions the genre explored

06:12.720 --> 06:13.800
as time went on?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.680
There've been a couple of revivals over the years,

06:15.680 --> 06:18.440
like Braindead 13, which is probably straight up

06:18.440 --> 06:20.600
the best example of this weird subgenre

06:20.600 --> 06:21.680
of playable animation,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.640
and there's also more weird cash-ins

06:23.640 --> 06:25.520
from the original boom to go back and find,

06:25.520 --> 06:28.340
like, uh, Time Gal or Ninja Hayate

06:28.340 --> 06:30.760
or Super Don Quixote

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
or...

06:33.560 --> 06:35.140
E-Esch's...

06:35.140 --> 06:36.760
Au-runmiller.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.840
If your timing is off, poor Don will die a hideous death.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.060
Or Cliffhanger, which was actually made out

06:42.060 --> 06:44.380
of recut footage from Lupin III films,

06:44.380 --> 06:46.260
including Castle of Cagliostro.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.720
So we technically got an arcade game

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
featuring animation by Hayao Miyazaki.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.760
That's kind of mind-blowing.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.260
Jump!

06:55.260 --> 06:58.100
Jump!

06:58.100 --> 06:59.840
It was clearly rushed incredibly quickly

06:59.840 --> 07:02.220
to make it to market, so the dub is so atrocious

07:02.220 --> 07:05.180
that you can actually make out the original Japanese voices

07:05.180 --> 07:06.420
from the films underneath.

07:06.420 --> 07:07.640
Clarisse!

07:07.640 --> 07:09.800
Dragon's Lair's namesake earned it a good deal

07:09.800 --> 07:11.180
of notoriety and nostalgia,

07:11.180 --> 07:13.600
even as its format and imitators failed.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.340
The game had several sequels

07:15.340 --> 07:16.960
and has been repackaged many times

07:16.960 --> 07:19.100
onto almost every imaginable console.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.300
There was an Indiegogo campaign to fund a piece

07:21.300 --> 07:23.560
designed to help fund a Dragon's Lair movie.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.880
In other words, to take even what game there was

07:26.880 --> 07:28.060
out of their game.

07:28.060 --> 07:29.940
There's also a couple of different ports

07:29.940 --> 07:31.100
that are actually new games,

07:31.100 --> 07:34.060
including a famously ridiculously difficult NES version

07:34.060 --> 07:36.320
of which I've never even beaten the first screen.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.320
There's a rubbish SNES version of Space Ace,

07:38.320 --> 07:40.060
but neither actually captures the thing

07:40.060 --> 07:42.740
that made these games cool and unique at the time,

07:42.740 --> 07:44.480
so they wouldn't be all that interesting

07:44.480 --> 07:45.820
even if they were fun.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.940
So if you're interested in tracking this genre

07:47.940 --> 07:49.600
of fully animated adventure game,

07:49.600 --> 07:51.700
there isn't that much to track.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.940
But what if I told you there was an even more true successor

07:54.940 --> 07:58.280
to Dragon's Lair than the hasty sequels or the cash-ins?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.620
What if I told you there was a secret,

08:00.620 --> 08:03.360
forgotten third game in the saga

08:03.360 --> 08:06.440
of Dragon's Lair and Space Ace?

08:06.440 --> 08:07.780
Ooh, saga.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.580
That makes it sound important.

08:09.580 --> 08:13.500
But first, a question everyone seems to take for granted.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.400
Who made Dragon's Lair?

08:15.400 --> 08:18.040
♪♪

08:18.040 --> 08:20.040
When people think of Dragon's Lair,

08:20.040 --> 08:21.900
they think of Don Bluth.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.080
It's easy to see why.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.400
Let's look at one of the posters.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.580
Magicon presents a Don Bluth Studios production.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.280
Design and animation, Don Bluth.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.580
Posters don't have to be arranged this way.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.240
This is a purposeful choice.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.280
It creates the impression that, like a modern-day Merlin,

08:40.280 --> 08:44.000
Don Bluth assembled Dragon's Lair with his own two hands.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.900
Geoffrey of Monmouth never left us.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.120
He just became a marketing consultant.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.500
The creator is Don Bluth,

08:49.500 --> 08:51.540
who once directed several Disney features

08:51.540 --> 08:53.200
in the mid-1970s.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.340
Last year, Bluth found his own audience

08:55.340 --> 08:56.960
with his first animated feature,

08:56.960 --> 08:58.460
The Secret of NIMH.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.960
You see, people tend to remember history

09:00.960 --> 09:02.420
in terms of winners.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.500
Secret of NIMH had been wildly successful

09:04.500 --> 09:05.540
the previous year.

09:05.540 --> 09:07.800
Don Bluth was swiftly becoming a household name,

09:07.800 --> 09:09.760
and his legend about leaving Disney

09:09.760 --> 09:11.720
and piling everything he had into NIMH,

09:11.720 --> 09:13.720
even mortgaging his house to complete it,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.180
and making it all back and more,

09:15.180 --> 09:16.560
was compelling.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.880
History likes people who gamble and win,

09:18.880 --> 09:20.300
and history tends to only remember

09:20.300 --> 09:21.760
whose name was on the poster.

09:21.780 --> 09:23.660
History has a knack of not remembering

the hundreds of talented people

09:25.300 --> 09:26.800

10:11.000 --> 10:12.960
Dyer had spent his youth making fantasy games

10:12.960 --> 10:15.640
using text and pictures drawn onto cash register paper

10:15.640 --> 10:18.220
programmed to scroll to the right point as he made choices.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.920
When attempts to sell a digitized game

10:19.920 --> 10:21.060
along these lines failed,

10:21.060 --> 10:22.560
he decided that more animation

10:22.560 --> 10:24.220
would create a better connection with the viewer

10:24.220 --> 10:25.980
and started work on Dragon's Lair.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.100
Later, he hired John Bluth's studio

10:28.100 --> 10:29.940
to do the animation itself.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.440
But despite his success,

10:31.440 --> 10:34.660
Dyer was aware of the flaws with Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.240
Firstly, he'd wanted people to be able to play them at home,

10:37.240 --> 10:38.860
but arcades had become a necessity

10:38.860 --> 10:41.320
given the expense of the technology required to play them.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.460
Secondly, they were short and had limited scope

10:43.460 --> 10:45.880
in terms of story or genuine decision-making.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.620
Dyer had gotten into making games as a kid

10:47.620 --> 10:51.660
because he liked to make big adventures with grand stories.

10:51.660 --> 10:54.700
He wasn't happy with Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.900
He wanted to make something bigger.

10:56.900 --> 11:01.200
["I think right now the arcade industry is playing catch-up to us.

11:01.200 --> 11:06.460
I know what's coming after the introduction of our home system."

11:06.700 --> 11:11.700
["What I'm going to do is to create a world that is so real

11:11.700 --> 11:16.700
and that you will have a hard time telling what's real and what isn't."

11:16.700 --> 11:19.700
In late 1984, Dyer's company began work

11:19.700 --> 11:21.700
on what he hoped would blow the lid off

11:21.700 --> 11:23.960
of home gaming again after its collapse.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.960
He was about to inaugurate a company

11:25.960 --> 11:27.460
that would be able to produce games

11:27.460 --> 11:29.460
that would be able to be played at home.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.460
However, the company didn't have the funds

11:31.460 --> 11:33.460
to produce the games it was going to produce.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.460
The Halcyon was an incredibly ambitious system.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.460
The name—designed to deliberately invoke

11:39.460 --> 11:43.460
the name of Hal 9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.460
And no, that's not me being weird

11:45.460 --> 11:47.460
and reading too much into it this time.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.460
They really meant to invite that comparison.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.460
["If you remember the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey,

11:52.460 --> 11:54.460
there was a guy named Hal 9000,

11:54.460 --> 11:56.460
and he was the one who came up with the name

11:56.460 --> 12:00.460
of the game that was going to be released in 2001."

12:00.460 --> 12:03.460
["If you remember the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey,

12:03.460 --> 12:06.460
there was a computer in that movie called Hal."

12:06.460 --> 12:08.460
Why you would make your console invoke the name

12:08.460 --> 12:10.460
of an AI that goes mad and kills most of its crew,

12:10.460 --> 12:11.460
I don't know.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.460
I think you might have fallen asleep

12:13.460 --> 12:14.460
halfway through the film.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.460
For the time, it was ambitious,

12:16.460 --> 12:17.460
the same way Dragon's Lair had been.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.460
You could speak to Hal,

12:19.460 --> 12:20.460
the name of the AI in the Halcyon,

12:20.460 --> 12:23.460
and it could talk back to you and even remember your name.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.460
["Good evening, Hal.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.460
What do you want, Rick?"

12:27.460 --> 12:30.460
What do you want, Rick?

12:30.460 --> 12:32.460
It sounds so mad at him.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.460
["Eight."

12:36.460 --> 12:39.460
["That's my 847 spin."

12:39.460 --> 12:41.460
["Disco."

12:45.460 --> 12:47.460
["Maybe he's what a computer should have been,

12:47.460 --> 12:50.460
all along, something that anybody can use

12:50.460 --> 12:52.460
because anybody can talk."

12:52.460 --> 12:53.460
Hang on.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.460
Clearly, Rick Dyer's never been to Liverpool.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.460
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

12:58.460 --> 13:01.460
Obviously, this is basic AI by modern standards,

13:01.460 --> 13:03.460
but the idea of a home media device

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
you could talk to in 1984

13:05.460 --> 13:07.460
before the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System

13:07.460 --> 13:09.460
was even out in America or Europe

13:09.460 --> 13:11.460
was kind of amazing.

13:11.460 --> 13:14.460
["Visit worlds which were only dreams

13:14.460 --> 13:16.460
before Halcyon,

13:16.460 --> 13:20.460
like nothing you've experienced ever."

13:20.460 --> 13:22.460
Here's Dyer demonstrating Hal

13:22.460 --> 13:25.460
on a 1985 edition of the show Computer Chronicles.

13:25.460 --> 13:28.460
["If I have your voice, friend,

13:28.460 --> 13:30.460
please say your name."

13:30.460 --> 13:31.460
["Stuart."

13:31.460 --> 13:35.460
["Nice to see you again, Stuart Sheffy.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.460
Can I call you Stuart?"

13:37.460 --> 13:39.460
["Yes."

13:39.460 --> 13:41.460
["Yes. Okay, Stuart."

13:41.460 --> 13:43.460
And to launch with it, Dyer and his team

13:43.460 --> 13:45.460
were working on a new game.

13:45.460 --> 13:47.460
It was called Thayer's Quest.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.460
["The game that comes with this is Thayer's Quest."

13:49.460 --> 13:51.460
["This is a story about greed,

13:51.460 --> 13:54.460
about unbridled ambition and powerlust

13:54.460 --> 13:57.460
and the disaster resulting from those faults."

13:57.460 --> 13:59.460
Thayer's Quest was gonna be more

13:59.460 --> 14:01.460
than just a video file with button prompts.

14:01.460 --> 14:04.460
Thayer's Quest was going to be an adventure.

14:04.460 --> 14:07.460
["What we're creating is going to allow you

14:07.460 --> 14:10.460
to be anything that you ever wanted to be

14:10.460 --> 14:11.460
and experience it.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.460
You're gonna be there.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.460
You will live and die by your decisions."

14:14.460 --> 14:17.460
A game where you choose where your character goes

14:17.460 --> 14:19.460
on a journey across a world of five kingdoms

14:19.460 --> 14:22.460
interacting with an all-new fantasy story.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.460
["Unlike standard video games that demand quick reflexes,

14:25.460 --> 14:28.460
the new project places a premium on thinking.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.460
You talk to the computer, and it will talk back."

14:31.460 --> 14:32.460
An adventure featuring animation

14:32.460 --> 14:35.460
instead of just text or the day's primitive graphics,

14:35.460 --> 14:37.460
utilizing Laserdisc technology once more,

14:37.460 --> 14:39.460
but on a scale even more grand

14:39.460 --> 14:41.460
than the game's spiritual predecessors

14:41.460 --> 14:44.460
and doing it all in the player's own home.

14:44.460 --> 14:47.460
["We're estimating that you'll be able to play the game

14:47.460 --> 14:49.460
20 hours a week for six months

14:49.460 --> 14:52.460
before you will have explored the entire world."

14:52.460 --> 14:54.460
The price tag of this home Laserdisc player

14:54.460 --> 14:57.460
slash games console slash talking AI computer?

14:57.460 --> 15:00.460
$2,500.

15:00.460 --> 15:04.460
That's nearly $6,000 in 2017 money,

15:04.460 --> 15:05.460
which means that in the UK,

15:05.460 --> 15:08.460
it would cost at least 400 pounds.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.460
Laserdisc players were crazy expensive at the time,

15:11.460 --> 15:13.460
but even that was pretty steep.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.460
But hey, you could play an animated adventure quest

15:15.460 --> 15:17.460
by talking to a computer.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.460
["There has never been speech recognition

15:19.460 --> 15:21.460
of the high caliber that this has."

15:21.460 --> 15:24.460
Well, not really.

15:24.460 --> 15:26.460
["Let's go to the forest clearing."

15:26.460 --> 15:27.460
["One."

15:27.460 --> 15:28.460
["What?"

15:28.460 --> 15:29.460
["One."

15:29.460 --> 15:33.460
["Speak consistently, Stuart."

15:33.460 --> 15:34.460
["One."

15:34.460 --> 15:36.460
["Sir?"

15:36.460 --> 15:37.460
["Two."

15:37.460 --> 15:39.460
["Two."

15:39.460 --> 15:41.460
["Is that okay, I mean?"

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
You see, this was the 80s.

15:43.460 --> 15:46.460
People had an idea of what the future was going to look like

15:46.460 --> 15:49.460
without really knowing it or thinking about its practicalities.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.460
The future is always different from how people of the present

15:52.460 --> 15:54.460
think the future will be.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.460
The Halcyon was ultimately a poor facsimile

15:56.460 --> 15:59.460
of one man's best guess as to what the future would look like,

15:59.460 --> 16:02.460
and it turned out not to be a very good guess.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.460
Still, I really wanted to know what this device

16:04.460 --> 16:07.460
was actually like to use and what Taya's quest played like,

16:07.460 --> 16:10.460
so I decided to take a look on eBay and see if one popped up.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.460
That was a year and a half ago.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.460
So far, I've seen one go up

16:15.460 --> 16:18.460
for $600 plus some hefty import fees.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.460
Based on rumblings on other forums,

16:20.460 --> 16:23.460
one tends to appear on eBay, perhaps even the same one,

16:23.460 --> 16:25.460
every year or so.

16:25.460 --> 16:28.460
While flyers advertising the Halcyon were circulated

16:28.460 --> 16:30.460
and some stores even took pre-orders

16:30.460 --> 16:32.460
and some salesmen were given copies

16:32.460 --> 16:34.460
to demonstrate to potential customers,

16:34.460 --> 16:36.460
it's actually up for debate

16:36.460 --> 16:39.460
whether the Halcyon was ever officially released.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.460
It's possible that this shot

16:42.460 --> 16:45.460
contains every existing Halcyon.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.460
As far as I can tell, no museums

16:47.460 --> 16:49.460
have a Halcyon in their corridors,

16:49.460 --> 16:51.460
except possibly the Video Game History Museum

16:51.460 --> 16:53.460
in Frisco, Texas.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
If I ever end up in Texas for some reason,

16:55.460 --> 16:57.460
like, I don't know, my plane crashes,

16:57.460 --> 16:59.460
I'll head there and see if they've got it.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.460
So the Halcyon was a failure.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
It didn't sell very well.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.460
In fact, it arguably didn't sell very well

17:05.460 --> 17:07.460
because it didn't sell very well.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.460
In fact, it arguably didn't actually make it

17:09.460 --> 17:11.460
to the stores in a way people could buy,

17:11.460 --> 17:13.460
and the company went bankrupt pretty soon after,

17:13.460 --> 17:15.460
but that's not the end of Teya's quest.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.460
When the company started to go under,

17:17.460 --> 17:19.460
they started selling conversion kits

17:19.460 --> 17:21.460
for Dragon's Lair arcade cabinets.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.460
It's hard to tell how well those sold either,

17:23.460 --> 17:25.460
but Laserdiscs, marquees, instruction manuals,

17:25.460 --> 17:28.460
and EEPROM chips from the game are floating around on eBay,

17:28.460 --> 17:30.460
so there's probably at least a few.

17:30.460 --> 17:32.460
I've heard tell of the arcade version

17:32.460 --> 17:34.460
appearing at conventions and some other gaming events.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.460
It's still pretty rare, though,

17:37.460 --> 17:39.460
never mind if you'd be able to get together

17:39.460 --> 17:41.460
the technology to actually play them.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.460
Wait. What's this?

17:43.460 --> 17:45.460
Teya's Quest? On...

17:45.460 --> 17:47.460
CD-ROM?

17:47.460 --> 17:49.460
From Canada?

17:49.460 --> 17:51.460
For only 19.94 Canadian US dollars?

17:51.460 --> 17:53.460
I mean...

17:53.460 --> 17:55.460
I had to.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.460
Didn't I? I had to.

17:57.460 --> 17:59.460
I needed to know.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.460
Ah, and here we are.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.460
Is it in the shot?

18:03.460 --> 18:05.460
Okay, great, yeah.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.460
...on a disc

18:08.460 --> 18:10.460
far smaller than it was ever designed for.

18:10.460 --> 18:12.460
This disc was printed in 2005,

18:12.460 --> 18:14.460
over 20 years

18:14.460 --> 18:16.460
after it was originally made,

18:16.460 --> 18:18.460
and that means it's another 12 years old

18:18.460 --> 18:20.460
on top of that.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.460
The latest system requirements

18:22.460 --> 18:24.460
that it recommends what operating system you can use

18:24.460 --> 18:26.460
is Windows XP.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.460
God, do you remember those days when that was the fastest operating system?

18:29.460 --> 18:31.460
This...

18:31.460 --> 18:33.460
Just...

18:33.460 --> 18:35.460
God, it even smells of Windows XP.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.460
Like...

18:37.460 --> 18:39.460
a very old, new car smell

18:39.460 --> 18:41.460
and just the beginning of dust.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.460
Ah, it's beautiful.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.460
It's like a time capsule.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.460
Thanks, Canada.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.460
Hey, according to this Digital Leisure put this out,

18:49.460 --> 18:51.460
you might remember them as the people

18:51.460 --> 18:53.460
who did some PlayStation Home, like, casino games

18:53.460 --> 18:55.460
that were pretty popular,

18:55.460 --> 18:57.460
and then when PlayStation Home closed,

18:57.460 --> 18:59.460
I think they're moving them to Steam.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.460
And then before... Oh, wait!

19:01.460 --> 19:03.460
They did the re-releases of, uh,

19:03.460 --> 19:05.460
Dragon's Lair and the sequel to that

19:05.460 --> 19:07.460
and, uh, Space Ace, didn't they?

19:07.460 --> 19:09.460
So it makes sense that they would do this.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.460
Did they also do Mad Dog McCree

19:11.460 --> 19:13.460
and Space Pirates?

19:13.460 --> 19:15.460
Space Pirates is, like,

19:15.460 --> 19:17.460
a game only I seem to remember whenever I bring it up.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.460
I hope I'm not imagining that game.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.460
Anyway, let's close the loop on all this

19:21.460 --> 19:23.460
and actually give this game a look, shall we?

19:28.460 --> 19:30.460
In a traditional fantasy land,

19:30.460 --> 19:32.460
the bad wizard man thing,

19:32.460 --> 19:34.460
Saucerball, has killed almost all

19:34.460 --> 19:36.460
of the Elder Kings

19:36.460 --> 19:38.460
and is going to take over the world.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.460
The last in the Elder Kings line is the player character,

19:40.460 --> 19:43.460
Téa Alkenred.

19:43.460 --> 19:45.460
His wizard mentor, Droos,

19:45.460 --> 19:47.460
wants him to gather the five artifacts

19:47.460 --> 19:49.460
that form an amulet called the Hand

19:49.460 --> 19:51.460
made by another wizard

19:51.460 --> 19:54.460
named Kwoad in order to beat Saucerball.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.460
Kwoad is gone,

19:56.460 --> 19:59.460
but the one who will come remains.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.460
I am ready.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.460
But before Droos will send him on his quest,

20:03.460 --> 20:05.460
he gives him a final test.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.460
That rhymed. That was weird.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.460
♪♪

20:10.460 --> 20:13.460
Téa, choose an exit quickly

20:13.460 --> 20:15.460
or fail this test of magic.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.460
You have to choose the left door

20:17.460 --> 20:19.460
or the right door.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.460
You have failed, Téa.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.460
You're dead. You're just dead.

20:24.460 --> 20:27.460
Your mentor's test kills you immediately

20:27.460 --> 20:29.460
if you choose the wrong door,

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
and he's supposed to be the good guy.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.460
Anyway, if you get it right, he gives you a pouch

20:33.460 --> 20:35.460
with your first three items, single-use spells,

20:35.460 --> 20:37.460
which are the solution to three puzzles in the game,

20:37.460 --> 20:39.460
and then you get to go out into the world.

20:39.460 --> 20:42.460
I have tried 22 apprentices over the years,

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
and they have all died.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.460
I bet right now Téa's thinking,

20:46.460 --> 20:48.460
yeah, and how many of those did you kill

20:48.460 --> 20:50.460
by sending to the ticking clock,

20:50.460 --> 20:52.460
flying symbol, fantasy zone?

20:52.460 --> 20:54.460
The game does diverge in gameplay

20:54.460 --> 20:56.460
from its predecessors in a kind of significant way.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.460
You actually choose places to go

20:58.460 --> 21:00.460
and what items to use,

21:00.460 --> 21:02.460
and take your time to make decisions.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.460
You're no longer hitting buttons to not die

21:04.460 --> 21:06.460
while traversing a linear path.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.460
It's incredibly simplistic, though.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
A lot of choices amount to picking one

21:10.460 --> 21:12.460
and hoping it's not the one that kills you,

21:12.460 --> 21:14.460
like with the two doors,

21:14.460 --> 21:16.460
or perhaps, to be a bit more accurate,

21:16.460 --> 21:18.460
a choose-your-own-adventure book,

21:18.460 --> 21:20.460
like Warlock of Firetop Mountain

21:20.460 --> 21:22.460
or Creature of Havoc

21:22.460 --> 21:24.460
or the Goosebumps ones.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.460
You choose where to go from a list

21:26.460 --> 21:28.460
with a mouse in this version

21:28.460 --> 21:30.460
instead of saying a number out loud, sadly,

21:30.460 --> 21:32.460
and sometimes you use an item.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.460
It's very trial and error.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
For example, at this point,

21:36.460 --> 21:38.460
a lady gives you this advice.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.460
...which burns on the marshways

21:40.460 --> 21:42.460
can destroy the landwares.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.460
What's a landware?

21:44.460 --> 21:46.460
How is this advice useful to a player?

21:46.460 --> 21:48.460
It's a made-up word.

21:48.460 --> 21:50.460
Then at one point later on,

21:50.460 --> 21:52.460
these ghosts attack you, and then you get one chance

21:52.460 --> 21:54.460
to use an item, and you die if it's the wrong item.

21:54.460 --> 21:56.460
Well, guess what?

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
These are the landwares,

21:58.460 --> 22:00.460
and you need to have gone to a place

22:00.460 --> 22:02.460
that's covered in fire

22:02.460 --> 22:04.460
and click on it

22:04.460 --> 22:06.460
to then realize it's cold fire

22:06.460 --> 22:08.460
so that you take some and then put it in your bag

22:08.460 --> 22:10.460
first, and then you use it here

22:10.460 --> 22:12.460
to kill the landwares and progress.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.460
And yeah, the game lets you use the scrolls

22:14.460 --> 22:16.460
in places where they don't solve the puzzle

22:16.460 --> 22:18.460
they're made for, and they're just gone.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.460
You can waste a scroll on the landwares

22:20.460 --> 22:22.460
if you think that's what you're supposed to use,

22:22.460 --> 22:24.460
and they even have it so they don't kill you

22:24.460 --> 22:26.460
for trying, even though you can't progress

22:26.460 --> 22:28.460
at this point because you can no longer

22:28.460 --> 22:30.460
pick up this crystal without exploding

22:30.460 --> 22:32.460
because you needed the scroll of release.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.460
The art and animation isn't nearly as good

22:34.460 --> 22:36.460
as in Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.460
It looks okay, but it was quite clearly rushed.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.460
The game keeps finding excuses

22:40.460 --> 22:42.460
to not have to lip-sync anyone's mouths.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.460
Are you the people of the dunes?

23:07.460 --> 23:09.460
I mean no harm to you.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.460
There are different voice lines for coming back

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
to some areas more than once, which means

23:21.460 --> 23:23.460
the animation with no clear mouth movement can be easily

23:23.460 --> 23:25.460
reused. I think this is why they did it,

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
but it just means the whole game looks

23:27.460 --> 23:29.460
less good at the expense of being reusable.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.460
What? You again?

23:32.460 --> 23:34.460
What? You again?

23:34.460 --> 23:36.460
Overall, it's a lot less dynamic

23:36.460 --> 23:38.460
or fantastical than the other games,

23:38.460 --> 23:40.460
but since it relies more on decision-making

23:40.460 --> 23:42.460
than quick reflexes, I can understand the visual change.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.460
Some of the deaths are still pretty funny.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.460
This might just be

23:49.460 --> 23:51.460
the only game in history

23:51.460 --> 23:53.460
where you can be killed by wheat.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.460
Also, the voice acting's pretty good, isn't it?

23:55.460 --> 23:57.460
Apart from after you kill

23:57.460 --> 23:59.460
the False King Torlok—remember that name,

23:59.460 --> 24:01.460
by the way—one of his guards has this to say.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.460
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

24:05.460 --> 24:07.460
For ten years I've waited to see this.

24:07.460 --> 24:09.460
Thank you, friend!

24:09.460 --> 24:11.460
Nothing says welcome to a realm

24:11.460 --> 24:13.460
of fantasy and adventure quite like

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
Kermit the Frog.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.460
This version is basically just a bunch of video files

24:17.460 --> 24:19.460
playing in a custom video player.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.460
If you check the disc's files, even the inventory screens

24:21.460 --> 24:23.460
are just .mpegs on a loop.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.460
It's almost clever how they managed to get the old game

24:25.460 --> 24:27.460
together on a new system, but it's also

24:27.460 --> 24:29.460
a reminder that the game you're playing is literally

24:29.460 --> 24:31.460
just a collection of interlocking menus,

24:31.460 --> 24:33.460
like the weird bonus games they used to put on

24:33.460 --> 24:35.460
early DVD releases of films.

24:35.460 --> 24:37.460
Anyway, after a bit over 30 minutes of trial

24:37.460 --> 24:39.460
and error—somewhat less than the

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
month's dire predicted—I had

24:41.460 --> 24:43.460
three artifacts and reached the bridge to the fourth

24:43.460 --> 24:45.460
kingdom, The Far Reaches.

24:45.460 --> 24:47.460
Pass and be warned

24:47.460 --> 24:49.460
that the southern barbarians roam

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
The Far Reaches.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.460
It is a lawless kingdom now.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
Wha—wait, what?

24:57.460 --> 24:59.460
You have beaten Téa's Quest?

24:59.460 --> 25:01.460
More challenges await you in Shadowin?

25:01.460 --> 25:03.460
The sequel to Téa's—

25:03.460 --> 25:05.460
what? The game ends with a trailer

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
for a game called Kingdom Shadowin.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.460
Why does the main character look so different?

25:09.460 --> 25:11.460
How is there a sequel to a

25:11.460 --> 25:13.460
game no one played on a console

25:13.460 --> 25:15.460
that no one bought? How did

25:15.460 --> 25:17.460
playing this game only give me more questions?

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
Wh—what?

25:19.460 --> 25:21.460
♪♪

25:21.460 --> 25:23.460
Okay.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.460
It turns out there's one more

25:25.460 --> 25:27.460
twist in the tale of Téa's Quest.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.460
There's also the twist that it's

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
pronounced Théa's Quest,

25:31.460 --> 25:33.460
but it's too late to re-record

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
all the voiceover, so...

25:35.460 --> 25:37.460
The game was either left unfinished or intended to be

25:37.460 --> 25:39.460
the first part in a series released hastily

25:39.460 --> 25:41.460
to try to recoup costs for it in the Halcyon,

25:41.460 --> 25:43.460
with plans to make a sequel before the company

25:43.460 --> 25:45.460
went bankrupt and the whole endeavor was scrapped.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.460
While this 2005 CD

25:47.460 --> 25:49.460
is a close to faithful version of the

25:49.460 --> 25:51.460
original audio and video of the arcade version,

25:51.460 --> 25:53.460
and also there's a DVD version released

25:53.460 --> 25:55.460
at the same time just for DVD players

25:55.460 --> 25:57.460
and there's some more behind-the-scenes footage on it,

25:57.460 --> 25:59.460
a decade prior, in 1995,

25:59.460 --> 26:01.460
ten years before this version

26:01.460 --> 26:03.460
and ten years after the original release,

26:03.460 --> 26:05.460
the game was ported to the 3DO,

26:05.460 --> 26:07.460
the CDI, and DOS PCs

26:07.460 --> 26:09.460
under the name Kingdom the Far

26:09.460 --> 26:11.460
Reaches. The CDI and

26:11.460 --> 26:13.460
3DO are basically considered critical and

26:13.460 --> 26:15.460
commercial failures, but this is perhaps

26:15.460 --> 26:17.460
the one context where I can't make fun of

26:17.460 --> 26:19.460
them, because even there a step up from the game's

26:19.460 --> 26:21.460
previous release on a console that never

26:21.460 --> 26:23.460
even officially came out.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.460
God, I feel kind of sorry for Rick Dyer.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.460
The poor guy kept trying, and it

26:27.460 --> 26:29.460
kept just not quite working out.

26:29.460 --> 26:31.460
This version of the game is the one that got the sequel,

26:31.460 --> 26:33.460
Kingdom Shadowun, released a year later

26:33.460 --> 26:35.460
for the same consoles.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.460
Some versions of Kingdom Part 2

26:37.460 --> 26:39.460
Shadowun are just called Shadowun

26:39.460 --> 26:41.460
for some reason. I also picked up a

26:41.460 --> 26:43.460
copy of Kingdom Book 1 the Far Reaches

26:43.460 --> 26:45.460
just to see what changes they made apart

26:45.460 --> 26:47.460
from the title. Let's check that out real quick.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.460
You comin' with me, boy?

26:49.460 --> 26:51.460
This version uses more compressed graphics,

26:51.460 --> 26:53.460
but also makes a bunch of weird changes.

26:53.460 --> 26:55.460
Along with the title, a bunch of character

26:55.460 --> 26:57.460
names have changed, too. The Elder Kings

26:57.460 --> 26:59.460
are now the Argent Kings,

26:59.460 --> 27:01.460
Téa Alkenred is now Lathan

27:01.460 --> 27:03.460
Kandor, Druce is now

27:03.460 --> 27:05.460
Daelin, Quode is now

27:05.460 --> 27:07.460
Mobus, and Saucerball is

27:07.460 --> 27:09.460
now Torlok.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.460
Torlok has become Drake's Blood

27:11.460 --> 27:13.460
the Wicked. Obviously, this means the voice

27:13.460 --> 27:15.460
acting had to be redone by new actors,

27:15.460 --> 27:17.460
and by actors, I mean whoever Rick Dyer

27:17.460 --> 27:19.460
got to program this new version got into

27:19.460 --> 27:21.460
a vocal booth for, like, five minutes.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.460
Mobus is gone, but the

27:23.460 --> 27:25.460
one who will come remains.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.460
I am ready.

27:27.460 --> 27:29.460
I can't verify the quote,

27:29.460 --> 27:31.460
but apparently Dyer thought

27:31.460 --> 27:33.460
the original names were

27:33.460 --> 27:35.460
270s, so he changed them.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.460
I don't think the names were the problem

27:37.460 --> 27:39.460
with the original's release. It was probably

27:39.460 --> 27:41.460
everything else. I can almost

27:41.460 --> 27:43.460
see Dyer in my head trying his very best

27:43.460 --> 27:45.460
to step as far as possible

27:45.460 --> 27:47.460
away from the game's previous incarnation,

27:47.460 --> 27:49.460
given its, frankly, traumatic history.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.460
The opening sequence is now an optional

27:51.460 --> 27:53.460
cutscene triggered at the beginning, which

27:53.460 --> 27:55.460
ends before Druce—sorry, Daelin

27:55.460 --> 27:57.460
makes you do the stupid bit with the doors.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.460
When you start the game, you get a piece of all-new

27:59.460 --> 28:01.460
animation, which looks kind of bad,

28:01.460 --> 28:03.460
in which Téa—sorry, Lathan

28:03.460 --> 28:05.460
gets told by Daelin about Drake's

28:05.460 --> 28:07.460
blood seizing the throne and how you need three

28:07.460 --> 28:09.460
artifacts to stop him. This is an interesting

28:09.460 --> 28:11.460
change. The original game ended

28:11.460 --> 28:13.460
suddenly partway through, and this

28:13.460 --> 28:15.460
cutscene basically rewrites the entire plot

28:15.460 --> 28:17.460
to be about doing the thing you

28:17.460 --> 28:19.460
actually end up doing towards the end of the

28:19.460 --> 28:21.460
actual amount of game they made.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.460
Too much of the game's dialogue references the evil

28:23.460 --> 28:25.460
wizard at the beginning, and he still appears in the game

28:25.460 --> 28:27.460
to attack you, so they couldn't take

28:27.460 --> 28:29.460
him out entirely. It's so weird

28:29.460 --> 28:31.460
to have one opening talk about the evil wizard

28:31.460 --> 28:33.460
who's now called Torlok, and then the

28:33.460 --> 28:35.460
actual opening tells you your quest is to stop

28:35.460 --> 28:37.460
a different bad guy who isn't called

28:37.460 --> 28:39.460
Torlok anymore. Like everything

28:39.460 --> 28:41.460
else about the legacy of this game, it's weird

28:41.460 --> 28:43.460
and esoteric for seemingly no reason.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.460
Even the name is weird. The Far

28:45.460 --> 28:47.460
Reaches is one of the two kingdoms from the

28:47.460 --> 28:49.460
original you don't end up going to

28:49.460 --> 28:51.460
because the game ends on the bridge to visit them.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.460
Why is this version called Kingdom

28:53.460 --> 28:55.460
The Far Reaches when there's no

28:55.460 --> 28:57.460
Far Reaches in it, and there's technically

28:57.460 --> 28:59.460
five kingdoms? That's a plural

28:59.460 --> 29:01.460
amount of kingdoms. I—I

29:01.460 --> 29:03.460
wish I hadn't noticed this. It's just frustrating.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.460
The gameplay is a bit different, too.

29:05.460 --> 29:07.460
You now click around a map screen to decide where

29:07.460 --> 29:09.460
to go. The first place you go is Dalen's

29:09.460 --> 29:11.460
mansion, where the cutscene from going through

29:11.460 --> 29:13.460
the correct door in the original just sort of

29:13.460 --> 29:15.460
plays as if you just walked in, and he

29:15.460 --> 29:17.460
gives you the scrolls. They also added more

29:17.460 --> 29:19.460
complex puzzles. For example, this guy who just

29:19.460 --> 29:21.460
talks to you in the first game is now blind,

29:21.460 --> 29:23.460
and you get a scroll of seeing from Dalen

29:23.460 --> 29:25.460
to use to get his advice. Dalen

29:25.460 --> 29:27.460
also asks you which scrolls you want him to work

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
on next, so you actually get to make a couple

29:29.460 --> 29:31.460
more choices than in the original, and the

29:31.460 --> 29:33.460
use of a main map screen actually makes it feel like

29:33.460 --> 29:35.460
you're traveling a world. Kind of.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.460
Slightly. A little bit.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.460
My son was your age

29:39.460 --> 29:41.460
when he learned that the cold fire which

29:41.460 --> 29:43.460
burns on the marsh waste can

29:43.460 --> 29:45.460
destroy the mist monsters.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.460
They call the land wares the mist

29:47.460 --> 29:49.460
monsters in this version. It's like

29:49.460 --> 29:51.460
Daya actually got my memo. Now

29:51.460 --> 29:53.460
the puzzle is decipherable

29:53.460 --> 29:55.460
by humans. Once you save

29:55.460 --> 29:57.460
the princess, you get the second new cutscene

29:57.460 --> 29:59.460
that's clearly new animation, where the princess

29:59.460 --> 30:01.460
says thanks and invites you to stay.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.460
I accept your gracious offer, princess.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.460
Then,

30:05.460 --> 30:07.460
together, they

30:07.460 --> 30:09.460
invent fireworks.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.460
Also, there's this really rocking

30:11.460 --> 30:13.460
track that plays when it's trying to load the credits.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.460
I think I want this as my new ringtone.

30:21.460 --> 30:23.460
And the credits roll, and the game ends with the trailer for Shadowin.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.460
So now, after covering

30:25.460 --> 30:27.460
this new version of the game, we can actually

30:27.460 --> 30:29.460
talk about its sequel. Its animation

30:29.460 --> 30:31.460
style has been altered significantly, and the character

30:31.460 --> 30:33.460
looks completely different. I have a feeling

30:33.460 --> 30:35.460
Daya and co. wanted to further differentiate

30:35.460 --> 30:37.460
Kingdom from Teya's Quest, and

30:37.460 --> 30:39.460
did so by changing how everything looked when the

30:39.460 --> 30:41.460
time came to make new animation for this sequel.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.460
Or maybe he just had different animators

30:43.460 --> 30:45.460
at this point. At this point, they probably either

30:45.460 --> 30:47.460
moved on to bigger projects, or quit

30:47.460 --> 30:49.460
and become a baker. Working as an

30:49.460 --> 30:51.460
animator's really hard at the best of times, and

30:51.460 --> 30:53.460
working on Teya's Quest seemed like it was a nightmare.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.460
The sequel is basically just more

30:55.460 --> 30:57.460
of the sort of gameplay from the previous game.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.460
You get the other two relics, and finally,

30:59.460 --> 31:01.460
after over a decade of waiting,

31:01.460 --> 31:03.460
you get to kill Torlok.

31:11.460 --> 31:13.460
Oh, come on. That was it? And then

31:13.460 --> 31:15.460
Lathan kisses the princess from the first game,

31:15.460 --> 31:17.460
and fireworks go off again, but there's more this time.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.460
And credits.

31:19.460 --> 31:25.460
Where do we go from around every turn?

31:33.460 --> 31:35.460
Why did I make this?

31:37.460 --> 31:39.460
Well, maybe

31:39.460 --> 31:41.460
because it's an interesting story.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.460
An immensely popular game that went away

31:43.460 --> 31:45.460
so quickly that its successor was all but forgotten.

31:45.460 --> 31:47.460
A recklessly optimistic

31:47.460 --> 31:49.460
console in a period when home gaming

31:49.460 --> 31:51.460
was hemorrhaging money that never even made it out the

31:51.460 --> 31:53.460
door, and a relentless barrage

31:53.460 --> 31:55.460
of unpronounceable names.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.460
In June, this warehouse will come to life.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.460
The new home video system that Rick and Jan

31:59.460 --> 32:01.460
Dyer have banked everything on will be shipped

32:01.460 --> 32:03.460
from here. My wife and I, as you probably

32:03.460 --> 32:05.460
can guess, are gambling everything

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
we own on this, so

32:07.460 --> 32:09.460
it's kind of scary,

32:09.460 --> 32:11.460
but that's the sort of thing that makes you want to

32:11.460 --> 32:13.460
succeed. Rick and his wife threw

32:13.460 --> 32:15.460
everything they had into Halcyon,

32:15.460 --> 32:17.460
and Halcyon took it all, took

32:17.460 --> 32:19.460
everything, and then it was gone,

32:19.460 --> 32:21.460
leaving them as barely a footnote

32:21.460 --> 32:23.460
in the history of video games. Maybe

32:23.460 --> 32:25.460
it's because I think Don Bluth is overrated,

32:25.460 --> 32:27.460
and I find his continued attempts to revive

32:27.460 --> 32:29.460
Dragon's Lair to be a little bit crass,

32:29.460 --> 32:31.460
and wanted to talk about the game's actual creator

32:31.460 --> 32:33.460
instead of the man who keeps getting the credit.

32:33.460 --> 32:35.460
If you type Rick Dyer into

32:35.460 --> 32:37.460
Wikipedia, you get a disambiguation

32:37.460 --> 32:39.460
page linking to two possible

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
notable Rick Dyers. One of them is

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
ours, the video game designer. His

32:43.460 --> 32:45.460
page is three short paragraphs

32:45.460 --> 32:47.460
in length. The second is titled

32:47.460 --> 32:49.460
Rick Dyer, and then in brackets,

32:49.460 --> 32:51.460
Bigfoot.

32:51.460 --> 32:53.460
Some guy who spread Bigfoot hoaxes

32:53.460 --> 32:55.460
is remembered in more detail

32:55.460 --> 32:57.460
than the inventor of Dragon's Lair.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.460
Or maybe it's because the way

32:59.460 --> 33:01.460
modern gaming's going right now, I'm a little

33:01.460 --> 33:03.460
bit worried. The marketplace is only

33:03.460 --> 33:05.460
getting bigger, and the tools of game

33:05.460 --> 33:07.460
creation are more available than ever before,

33:07.460 --> 33:09.460
and that means there's a lot more games competing

33:09.460 --> 33:11.460
for people's attention. There may not be

33:11.460 --> 33:13.460
another crash, but it's still a very

33:13.460 --> 33:15.460
big pool for a small fish.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.460
In any creative medium, it's scary

33:17.460 --> 33:19.460
to work knowing that what you create

33:19.460 --> 33:21.460
may only exist in permanent obscurity.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.460
The people who make it might be talented,

33:23.460 --> 33:25.460
but increasingly, they're also very

33:25.460 --> 33:27.460
lucky. Undertale got recognized

33:27.460 --> 33:29.460
because Toby Fox was in the right place at the

33:29.460 --> 33:31.460
right time with an already existing following

33:31.460 --> 33:33.460
around his Homestuck music. Dragon's Lair

33:33.460 --> 33:35.460
did well partially on the back of that name

33:35.460 --> 33:37.460
they put all over it. The next designer with

33:37.460 --> 33:39.460
the talent Toby Fox had

33:39.460 --> 33:41.460
might not be so lucky.

33:41.460 --> 33:43.460
The ancient Romans used to tell the story of a man

33:43.460 --> 33:45.460
called Romulus, a fantastical

33:45.460 --> 33:47.460
figure descended from royalty,

33:47.460 --> 33:49.460
raised by wolves who took part in all

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
the most important foundational

33:51.460 --> 33:53.460
events in Roman history, and

33:53.460 --> 33:55.460
named Rome after himself.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.460
The Romans looked at their society and liked to

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
imagine that it had all been the plan

33:59.460 --> 34:01.460
of some great genius.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.460
The Romans believed in dozens of

34:03.460 --> 34:05.460
mythical engines of creation.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.460
What was one more?

34:07.460 --> 34:09.460
Hundreds of incredible works of art have been done of

34:09.460 --> 34:11.460
epic historical events, huge

34:11.460 --> 34:13.460
important moments in history,

34:13.460 --> 34:15.460
the actions of gods or supposed

34:15.460 --> 34:17.460
men like Romulus.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.460
One of my favorite paintings is The Lacemaker.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.460
Johan Vermeer painted a

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
loving, accurate, and detailed rendition

34:23.460 --> 34:25.460
of a girl making

34:25.460 --> 34:27.460
lace. Vermeer celebrated

34:27.460 --> 34:29.460
real people doing ordinary

34:29.460 --> 34:31.460
things. He offered the

34:31.460 --> 34:33.460
radical idea that you didn't have to be

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
special or important or magical

34:35.460 --> 34:37.460
or legendary to be worth

34:37.460 --> 34:39.460
being painted or thought about

34:39.460 --> 34:41.460
or remembered. So it turns out

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
there are two ways of explaining history.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.460
We can be like Geoffrey of Monmouth or the

34:45.460 --> 34:47.460
early Romans and invent these

34:47.460 --> 34:49.460
magical, wondrous, brilliant people

34:49.460 --> 34:51.460
who gave everything to us.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.460
A wizard made Stonehenge all by himself.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.460
A man called Romulus

34:55.460 --> 34:57.460
invented Rome out of whole cloth

34:57.460 --> 34:59.460
and took part in every major historical

34:59.460 --> 35:01.460
event required to fulfill his

35:01.460 --> 35:03.460
amazing design.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
John Bluth made Dragon's Lair.

35:05.460 --> 35:07.460
Or we can be like Vermeer.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.460
A bunch of ordinary,

35:09.460 --> 35:11.460
everyday people built Stonehenge just by

35:11.460 --> 35:13.460
working together and putting time and effort

35:13.460 --> 35:15.460
into it. A bunch of ordinary

35:15.460 --> 35:17.460
people make video games by working

35:17.460 --> 35:19.460
together very hard for hours and hours

35:19.460 --> 35:21.460
and hours and days and years to make

35:21.460 --> 35:23.460
it. A bunch of regular, ordinary

35:23.460 --> 35:25.460
people built Rome over the span of a

35:25.460 --> 35:27.460
very long time, contributing

35:27.460 --> 35:29.460
to what would later be remembered as the

35:29.460 --> 35:31.460
exploits of one man. This way is

35:31.460 --> 35:33.460
nowhere near as magical as the ones we like to

35:33.460 --> 35:35.460
imagine put our world together.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.460
The truth is often very mundane.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.460
But maybe that's okay.

35:47.460 --> 35:49.460
We're pioneers.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
We're doing something that's never been done.

35:51.460 --> 35:53.460
We have artists, we have writers, we have engineers,

35:53.460 --> 35:55.460
we have technicians.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.460
They're all working together and that has never

35:57.460 --> 35:59.460
existed before. There's never really been a reason

35:59.460 --> 36:01.460
for those three groups

36:01.460 --> 36:03.460
to all coexist simultaneously.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.460
What we're really

36:05.460 --> 36:07.460
doing is combining art with science.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.460
I think there's something sad but

36:09.460 --> 36:11.460
beautiful about Rick Dyer and his dreams

36:11.460 --> 36:13.460
of Halcyon. He calls himself

36:13.460 --> 36:15.460
and his team pioneers in this news

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
broadcast, and the truth is

36:17.460 --> 36:19.460
he's right. Pioneer

36:19.460 --> 36:21.460
isn't an inherently positive term.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
It just means you were among the first to explore

36:23.460 --> 36:25.460
something, and that doesn't mean you were successful

36:25.460 --> 36:27.460
or right. A lot of early pioneers

36:27.460 --> 36:29.460
didn't make it back, and a lot

36:29.460 --> 36:31.460
of people, a lot of us,

36:31.460 --> 36:33.460
are going to end up more like Rick Dyer

36:33.460 --> 36:35.460
than we'd hoped to be. So if we

36:35.460 --> 36:37.460
can't learn to love and remember people like

36:37.460 --> 36:39.460
Rick, we're condemning ourselves

36:39.460 --> 36:41.460
in turn to be forgotten.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.460
Your work might not

36:43.460 --> 36:45.460
reach the audience it deserved, or you

36:45.460 --> 36:47.460
might not make something anyone likes,

36:47.460 --> 36:49.460
and it can be soul-crushing to embark on

36:49.460 --> 36:51.460
a journey knowing you might not succeed.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.460
But if we can learn to accept

36:53.460 --> 36:55.460
that it's okay to try and fail,

36:55.460 --> 36:57.460
and that people who fail are worth being remembered

36:57.460 --> 36:59.460
and appreciated, then maybe we can

36:59.460 --> 37:01.460
all at least learn to enjoy

37:01.460 --> 37:03.460
the humanizing experience of failure

37:03.460 --> 37:05.460
together.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.460
Thank you for watching.

37:19.460 --> 37:21.460
This video was quite a lot

37:21.460 --> 37:23.460
of time in the making, and I can only do things

37:23.460 --> 37:25.460
like this with the support I receive through Patreon,

37:25.460 --> 37:27.460
so I'd like to thank my supporters very much.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.460
