1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,780
In the middle of Wiltshire lies a ring of large standing stones, each weighing around 25 tons.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,120
It is believed the monument was assembled between 4,000 or 5,000 years ago.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,540
Archaeological evidence suggests it may have been a burial site or perhaps a place of healing where the injured were taken.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,380
Some also theorize it may have had a religious or astronomical importance.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,780
We call this place Stonehenge.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,880
We also call it a monument, but we don't even know if its creators would think such a thing.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,640
The culture that produced it left no written records, and even how it was built is still up for debate.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,340
In 1136, in his book, The History of the Kings of Britain,

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,800
Geoffrey of Monmouth, an early British historiographer, claimed the wizard Merlin built Stonehenge.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,220
Here's an illustration from the mid-14th century based on that theory.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,880
For roughly 500 years, building something like Stonehenge seemed so difficult

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,420
that it was commonly accepted that a wizard did it.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,880
Apparently, he did it with his bare hands, too.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,260
Thanks, Geoffrey!

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,020
It's a mysterious place because it provides us with questions and no real answers.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,300
What was the intent of its creators? What did they think of it, and what became of them?

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,980
What would a Britain built by these people look like?

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,020
The so-called monument points away to a version of the world that never came to be.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,680
Instead, it's one of the sole creations of a culture whose ideas and intent have simply vanished.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,640
Will we ever really know who built Stonehenge, or what it was for?

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,340
Probably not.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,260
And besides, it's just a bunch of rocks.

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,420
Anyway, today we're going to talk about Dragonslayer.

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,340
You play as a police mouse, who has to take back stolen goods from a gang of cats

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,060
by bouncing around in a weird void with random objects in it.

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,100
You can't really tell those pinky-purply things are cats,

27
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,600
and also, one would question the ability of a police captain who sent a mouse with no backup

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,020
to confiscate stolen goods from an army of cats,

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,180
but, you know, it's a pretty simple game.

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,340
It's a game where you have to play as a mouse, and it's a game where you have to play as a cat.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,020
...police captain who sent a mouse with no backup to confiscate stolen goods from an army of cats,

32
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,560
but it's fine enough.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,220
On June 14th, Mario Brothers hit arcades.

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,600
This was the first appearance of Mario's brother, Luigi.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,760
Oh boy, I'm so happy to meet Mario, but with different colors.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,220
Together, up to two players can jump around in a hellish void

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,100
knocking pixelated facsimiles of turtles around.

38
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,800
I mean, both of these games are fun to play,

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,880
but visually speaking, they're pretty poor appropriations of the thing the player's told they're doing.

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,720
I'm telling you all this so you can maybe imagine the impact when,

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,460
on June 19th that year,

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,720
just five days after Mario Brothers told you this mass of colors was a man called Luigi,

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
this happened.

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,560
["Dragon's Lair"]

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,640
["Dragon's Lair." You control the actions of a daring adventurer

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,600
finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard."

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,520
Hey, look! It's an actual person

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,520
who is trying to not die in an actual dungeon-looking place,

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,940
and look how much animation there is!

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,340
Look at the actual capital-A animation!

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:27,020
And if we look closely enough, we can even, maybe, see a game in here somewhere.

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,060
The mechanics of the game are very simplistic.

53
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,480
You watch the pretty impressively animated character make his way through a room,

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,060
and then press one of four directions or the attack button

55
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,140
when it's appropriate to do one of those things,

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,400
and if you do the wrong thing, you lose a life and get to watch a death animation.

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
And to store all the data for those animations,

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,360
the arcade game used a revolutionary content distribution system for the time

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,320
called a Laserdisc.

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,060
Ow!

61
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,100
Laserdiscs had been in use since the late 70s,

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,980
but the idea of using one of these as a way of storing more picture and sound information

63
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,780
than a normal arcade game could use hadn't been implemented in many games at this point.

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,820
This game was designed by Don Bluth, former Disney animator,

65
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,320
and Rick Dyer—forget about this guy, you'll never hear from him again,

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,600
let's just talk about Don Bluth some more—

67
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
he'd just made The Secret of NIMH, one of the best-looking animated films ever,

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,740
and was about to go on to make Rock-a-Doodle,

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Thumbelina,

70
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,240
A Troll in Central Park,

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,600
The Pebble and the Penguin,

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,800
Titan A.E.,

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
and also some good films.

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,440
I never saw any of the good ones growing up, um, so...

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,020
Bluth and his small team used their animation chops

76
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,020
to create an actually nice-looking game with dynamism and charm.

77
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,360
The game looked amazing, and everyone knew it.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Even though it was more expensive to play than other games,

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,100
they had huge lines at arcades,

80
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,640
and the machine sold amazingly,

81
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
with arcade producers partially thanking it

82
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,400
for getting them through a financially difficult time in history.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
And I do mean difficult.

84
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,260
Outside of arcades, what would later be called

85
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,180
the Great Video Game Crash of 1983 was happening.

86
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,940
The revenues of home game sales dropped almost 97%,

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,100
but Dragon's Lair and its appealing gimmick

88
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,020
had somewhat insulated arcades from these troubles.

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,680
This article from 1984 says LaserDisc Games

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
may be the wave of the future,

91
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
and drums up hype for Bluth's next game,

92
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,020
Space Ace.

93
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,360
♪♪

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Space Ace was similarly great-looking,

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,060
though it was effectively the same game as its predecessor,

96
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,280
only with a different theme and new animations.

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,020
It's just as fun to watch,

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,140
but by the time of its release later in 1984, however,

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,400
that wasn't really enough.

100
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,360
The lack of gameplay in these games

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,180
had come back to haunt them in the market.

102
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,780
There wasn't much replay value.

103
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
Once you knew how to beat it, that was it.

104
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,640
This put an upper ceiling on how much a person

105
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,980
could go back and enjoy something,

106
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,020
when other games had many levels and increasing difficulty.

107
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,020
Players had grown tired of the style,

108
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,600
and arcade owners went into buying expensive game units

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,180
with temperamental discs inside them

110
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,440
that players could memorize and never play again.

111
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,100
What they want is variety.

112
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,400
We constantly get tired of one type of food

113
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,060
or one type of movie or one type of game,

114
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,680
and so as you progress, you want to go on to a new thing.

115
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,720
LaserDisc Games had proven to be more

116
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,180
the splash of the future than the wave,

117
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,680
and the tide had gone out.

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,800
I think I might have gone a little bit overboard

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,060
with the water metaphors.

120
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,100
So what if you wanted more of this type of game

121
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,720
or wanted to see what directions the genre explored

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
as time went on?

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,680
There've been a couple of revivals over the years,

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,440
like Braindead 13, which is probably straight up

125
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,600
the best example of this weird subgenre

126
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,680
of playable animation,

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,640
and there's also more weird cash-ins

128
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
from the original boom to go back and find,

129
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,340
like, uh, Time Gal or Ninja Hayate

130
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,760
or Super Don Quixote

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
or...

132
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,140
E-Esch's...

133
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,760
Au-runmiller.

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,840
If your timing is off, poor Don will die a hideous death.

135
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,060
Or Cliffhanger, which was actually made out

136
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,380
of recut footage from Lupin III films,

137
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,260
including Castle of Cagliostro.

138
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,720
So we technically got an arcade game

139
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
featuring animation by Hayao Miyazaki.

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,760
That's kind of mind-blowing.

141
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,260
Jump!

142
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,100
Jump!

143
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,840
It was clearly rushed incredibly quickly

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,220
to make it to market, so the dub is so atrocious

145
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,180
that you can actually make out the original Japanese voices

146
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,420
from the films underneath.

147
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,640
Clarisse!

148
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,800
Dragon's Lair's namesake earned it a good deal

149
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,180
of notoriety and nostalgia,

150
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,600
even as its format and imitators failed.

151
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,340
The game had several sequels

152
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,960
and has been repackaged many times

153
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,100
onto almost every imaginable console.

154
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,300
There was an Indiegogo campaign to fund a piece

155
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,560
designed to help fund a Dragon's Lair movie.

156
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,880
In other words, to take even what game there was

157
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,060
out of their game.

158
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,940
There's also a couple of different ports

159
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,100
that are actually new games,

160
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,060
including a famously ridiculously difficult NES version

161
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,320
of which I've never even beaten the first screen.

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
There's a rubbish SNES version of Space Ace,

163
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,060
but neither actually captures the thing

164
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,740
that made these games cool and unique at the time,

165
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,480
so they wouldn't be all that interesting

166
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,820
even if they were fun.

167
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,940
So if you're interested in tracking this genre

168
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,600
of fully animated adventure game,

169
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,700
there isn't that much to track.

170
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,940
But what if I told you there was an even more true successor

171
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,280
to Dragon's Lair than the hasty sequels or the cash-ins?

172
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,620
What if I told you there was a secret,

173
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,360
forgotten third game in the saga

174
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,440
of Dragon's Lair and Space Ace?

175
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,780
Ooh, saga.

176
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,580
That makes it sound important.

177
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,500
But first, a question everyone seems to take for granted.

178
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,400
Who made Dragon's Lair?

179
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,040
♪♪

180
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
When people think of Dragon's Lair,

181
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,900
they think of Don Bluth.

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,080
It's easy to see why.

183
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,400
Let's look at one of the posters.

184
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,580
Magicon presents a Don Bluth Studios production.

185
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,280
Design and animation, Don Bluth.

186
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
Produced by Don Bluth.

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,620
Directed by Don Bluth.

188

Copyright, Don Bluth.

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,580
Posters don't have to be arranged this way.

190
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,240
This is a purposeful choice.

191
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,280
It creates the impression that, like a modern-day Merlin,

192
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,000
Don Bluth assembled Dragon's Lair with his own two hands.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,900
Geoffrey of Monmouth never left us.

194
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,120
He just became a marketing consultant.

195
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,500
The creator is Don Bluth,

196
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,540
who once directed several Disney features

197
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,200
in the mid-1970s.

198
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,340
Last year, Bluth found his own audience

199
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,960
with his first animated feature,

200
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,460
The Secret of NIMH.

201
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,960
You see, people tend to remember history

202
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,420
in terms of winners.

203
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,500
Secret of NIMH had been wildly successful

204
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,540
the previous year.

205
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,800
Don Bluth was swiftly becoming a household name,

206
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
and his legend about leaving Disney

207
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,720
and piling everything he had into NIMH,

208
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
even mortgaging his house to complete it,

209
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,180
and making it all back and more,

210
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,560
was compelling.

211
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
History likes people who gamble and win,

212
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,300
and history tends to only remember

213
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,760
whose name was on the poster.

214
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,660
History has a knack of not remembering

215
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,300
the hundreds of talented people

216
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,800
who worked on Secret of NIMH,

217
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,960
or the other animators behind Dragon's Lair,

218
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,620
or the programmers who made the system work at all,

219
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,500
or the man who actually made the game.

220
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,220
["The Idea of Turning Cartoons into Video Games"]

221
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,420

Remember Rick Dyer?

224
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,140
Despite the game actually being conceived

225
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,640
and programmed by RDI Video Systems

226
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,520
and RDI being short for Rick Dyer Industries,

227
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
history appears to have conspired

228
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,860
to make sure people forget Dyer

229
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,500
and that the game was his idea

230
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
and that he'd had this idea for a long time.

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,160
["It's the forerunner of Dragon's Lair.

232
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,000
["It was developed way back in 1979."

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
["This was Dyer's first computerized interactive game."

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,960
Dyer had spent his youth making fantasy games

235
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,640
using text and pictures drawn onto cash register paper

236
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,220
programmed to scroll to the right point as he made choices.

237
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,920
When attempts to sell a digitized game

238
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,060
along these lines failed,

239
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,560
he decided that more animation

240
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,220
would create a better connection with the viewer

241
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,980
and started work on Dragon's Lair.

242
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,100
Later, he hired John Bluth's studio

243
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,940
to do the animation itself.

244
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,440
But despite his success,

245
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,660
Dyer was aware of the flaws with Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.

246
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,240
Firstly, he'd wanted people to be able to play them at home,

247
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,860
but arcades had become a necessity

248
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,320
given the expense of the technology required to play them.

249
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,460
Secondly, they were short and had limited scope

250
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,880
in terms of story or genuine decision-making.

251
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,620
Dyer had gotten into making games as a kid

252
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,660
because he liked to make big adventures with grand stories.

253
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,700
He wasn't happy with Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.

254
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,900
He wanted to make something bigger.

255
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,200
["I think right now the arcade industry is playing catch-up to us.

256
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,460
I know what's coming after the introduction of our home system."

257
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,700
["What I'm going to do is to create a world that is so real

258
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,700
and that you will have a hard time telling what's real and what isn't."

259
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
In late 1984, Dyer's company began work

260
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
on what he hoped would blow the lid off

261
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,960
of home gaming again after its collapse.

262
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
He was about to inaugurate a company

263
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,460
that would be able to produce games

264
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
that would be able to be played at home.

265
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
However, the company didn't have the funds

266
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
to produce the games it was going to produce.

267
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
The Halcyon was an incredibly ambitious system.

268
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
The name—designed to deliberately invoke

269
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,460
the name of Hal 9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey.

270
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
And no, that's not me being weird

271
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
and reading too much into it this time.

272
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,460
They really meant to invite that comparison.

273
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,460
["If you remember the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey,

274
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
there was a guy named Hal 9000,

275
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,460
and he was the one who came up with the name

276
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,460
of the game that was going to be released in 2001."

277
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,460
["If you remember the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey,

278
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
there was a computer in that movie called Hal."

279
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Why you would make your console invoke the name

280
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,460
of an AI that goes mad and kills most of its crew,

281
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,460
I don't know.

282
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
I think you might have fallen asleep

283
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
halfway through the film.

284
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,460
For the time, it was ambitious,

285
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
the same way Dragon's Lair had been.

286
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
You could speak to Hal,

287
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
the name of the AI in the Halcyon,

288
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,460
and it could talk back to you and even remember your name.

289
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
["Good evening, Hal.

290
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
What do you want, Rick?"

291
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,460
What do you want, Rick?

292
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,460
It sounds so mad at him.

293
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
["Eight."

294
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,460
["That's my 847 spin."

295
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
["Disco."

296
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
["Maybe he's what a computer should have been,

all along, something that anybody can use

298
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
because anybody can talk."

299
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,460
Hang on.

300
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,460
Clearly, Rick Dyer's never been to Liverpool.

301
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

302
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,460
Obviously, this is basic AI by modern standards,

303
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
but the idea of a home media device

304
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
you could talk to in 1984

305
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
before the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System

306
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
was even out in America or Europe

307
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
was kind of amazing.

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,460
Here's Dyer demonstrating Hal

312

on a 1985 edition of the show Computer Chronicles.

313

["If I have your voice, friend,

["Yes. Okay, Stuart."

And to launch with it, Dyer and his team

321
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
were working on a new game.

322
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,460

327

Thayer's Quest was gonna be more

328

353
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,460
That's nearly $6,000 in 2017 money,

354
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
which means that in the UK,

355
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,460
it would cost at least 400 pounds.

356
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,460
Laserdisc players were crazy expensive at the time,

357
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
but even that was pretty steep.

358
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
But hey, you could play an animated adventure quest

359
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
by talking to a computer.

360
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
["There has never been speech recognition

361
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
of the high caliber that this has."

362
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,460
Well, not really.

363
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,460
["Let's go to the forest clearing."

364
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
["One."

365
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
["What?"

366
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
["One."

367
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,460
["Speak consistently, Stuart."

368
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
["One."

369
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,460
["Sir?"

370
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
["Two."

371
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,460
["Two."

372
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,460
["Is that okay, I mean?"

373
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
You see, this was the 80s.

374
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,460
People had an idea of what the future was going to look like

375
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,460
without really knowing it or thinking about its practicalities.

376
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,460
The future is always different from how people of the present

377
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,460
think the future will be.

378
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
The Halcyon was ultimately a poor facsimile

379
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,460
of one man's best guess as to what the future would look like,

380
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,460
and it turned out not to be a very good guess.

381
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Still, I really wanted to know what this device

382
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,460
was actually like to use and what Taya's quest played like,

383
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,460
so I decided to take a look on eBay and see if one popped up.

384
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
That was a year and a half ago.

385
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
So far, I've seen one go up

386
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,460
for $600 plus some hefty import fees.

387
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
Based on rumblings on other forums,

388
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
one tends to appear on eBay, perhaps even the same one,

389
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,460
every year or so.

390
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,460
While flyers advertising the Halcyon were circulated

391
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
and some stores even took pre-orders

392
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
and some salesmen were given copies

393
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
to demonstrate to potential customers,

394
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
it's actually up for debate

395
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,460
whether the Halcyon was ever officially released.

396
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
It's possible that this shot

397
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,460
contains every existing Halcyon.

398
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
As far as I can tell, no museums

399
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
have a Halcyon in their corridors,

400
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,460
except possibly the Video Game History Museum

401
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
in Frisco, Texas.

402
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
If I ever end up in Texas for some reason,

403
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
like, I don't know, my plane crashes,

404
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,460
I'll head there and see if they've got it.

405
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
So the Halcyon was a failure.

406
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
It didn't sell very well.

407
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
In fact, it arguably didn't sell very well

408
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
because it didn't sell very well.

409
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
In fact, it arguably didn't actually make it

410
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
to the stores in a way people could buy,

411
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,460
and the company went bankrupt pretty soon after,

412
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
but that's not the end of Teya's quest.

413
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
When the company started to go under,

414
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
they started selling conversion kits

415
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
for Dragon's Lair arcade cabinets.

416
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,460
It's hard to tell how well those sold either,

417
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
but Laserdiscs, marquees, instruction manuals,

418
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,460
and EEPROM chips from the game are floating around on eBay,

419
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,460
so there's probably at least a few.

420
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,460
I've heard tell of the arcade version

421
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
appearing at conventions and some other gaming events.

422
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
It's still pretty rare, though,

423
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
never mind if you'd be able to get together

424
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
the technology to actually play them.

425
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Wait. What's this?

426
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Teya's Quest? On...

427
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
CD-ROM?

428
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
From Canada?

429
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
For only 19.94 Canadian US dollars?

430
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
I mean...

431
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,460
I had to.

432
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,460
Didn't I? I had to.

433
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
I needed to know.

434
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Ah, and here we are.

435
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Is it in the shot?

436
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Okay, great, yeah.

437
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
...on a disc

438
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
far smaller than it was ever designed for.

439
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
This disc was printed in 2005,

440
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
over 20 years

441
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,460
after it was originally made,

442
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,460
and that means it's another 12 years old

443
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
on top of that.

444
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,460
The latest system requirements

445
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,460
that it recommends what operating system you can use

446
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,460
is Windows XP.

447
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,460
God, do you remember those days when that was the fastest operating system?

448
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,460
This...

449
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Just...

450
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
God, it even smells of Windows XP.

451
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Like...

452
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
a very old, new car smell

453
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
and just the beginning of dust.

454
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
Ah, it's beautiful.

455
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
It's like a time capsule.

456
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Thanks, Canada.

457
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Hey, according to this Digital Leisure put this out,

458
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
you might remember them as the people

459
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
who did some PlayStation Home, like, casino games

460
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
that were pretty popular,

461
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
and then when PlayStation Home closed,

462
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
I think they're moving them to Steam.

463
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
And then before... Oh, wait!

464
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
They did the re-releases of, uh,

465
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
Dragon's Lair and the sequel to that

466
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
and, uh, Space Ace, didn't they?

467
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
So it makes sense that they would do this.

468
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Did they also do Mad Dog McCree

469
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
and Space Pirates?

470
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Space Pirates is, like,

471
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
a game only I seem to remember whenever I bring it up.

472
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
I hope I'm not imagining that game.

473
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Anyway, let's close the loop on all this

474
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
and actually give this game a look, shall we?

475
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,460
♪♪

476
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
In a traditional fantasy land,

477
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
the bad wizard man thing,

478
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Saucerball, has killed almost all

479
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,460
of the Elder Kings

480
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
and is going to take over the world.

481
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
The last in the Elder Kings line is the player character,

482
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,460
Téa Alkenred.

483
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
His wizard mentor, Droos,

484
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
wants him to gather the five artifacts

485
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
that form an amulet called the Hand

486
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
made by another wizard

487
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,460
named Kwoad in order to beat Saucerball.

488
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Kwoad is gone,

489
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,460
but the one who will come remains.

490
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
I am ready.

491
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
But before Droos will send him on his quest,

492
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
he gives him a final test.

493
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
That rhymed. That was weird.

Téa, choose an exit quickly

or fail this test of magic.

497
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
You have to choose the left door

498
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
or the right door.

499
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
You have failed, Téa.

500
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
You're dead. You're just dead.

501
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Your mentor's test kills you immediately

with your first three items, single-use spells,

506
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,460
which are the solution to three puzzles in the game,

507
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
and then you get to go out into the world.

508
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I have tried 22 apprentices over the years,

509

I bet right now Téa's thinking,

511
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,460
yeah, and how many of those did you kill

512
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,460
by sending to the ticking clock,

513
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,460
flying symbol, fantasy zone?

514
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,460
The game does diverge in gameplay

515
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,460
from its predecessors in a kind of significant way.

516
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
You actually choose places to go

517
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,460
and what items to use,

518
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
and take your time to make decisions.

519
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
You're no longer hitting buttons to not die

520
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,460
while traversing a linear path.

521
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,460
It's incredibly simplistic, though.

522
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,460
A lot of choices amount to picking one

523
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
and hoping it's not the one that kills you,

524
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
like with the two doors,

525
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
or perhaps, to be a bit more accurate,

526

or Creature of Havoc

529
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
or the Goosebumps ones.

530
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
You choose where to go from a list

and sometimes you use an item.

534
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
It's very trial and error.

535
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
For example, at this point,

536
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,460
a lady gives you this advice.

537
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
...which burns on the marshways

538
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
can destroy the landwares.

539
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
What's a landware?

540
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
How is this advice useful to a player?

541
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
It's a made-up word.

542
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Then at one point later on,

543
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
these ghosts attack you, and then you get one chance

544
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
to use an item, and you die if it's the wrong item.

545
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Well, guess what?

546
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
These are the landwares,

547
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
and you need to have gone to a place

548
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
that's covered in fire

549
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
and click on it

550
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,460
to then realize it's cold fire

551
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
so that you take some and then put it in your bag

552
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
first, and then you use it here

553
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,460
to kill the landwares and progress.

554
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,460
And yeah, the game lets you use the scrolls

555
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,460
in places where they don't solve the puzzle

556
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
they're made for, and they're just gone.

557
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,460
You can waste a scroll on the landwares

558
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
if you think that's what you're supposed to use,

559
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,460
and they even have it so they don't kill you

560
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,460
for trying, even though you can't progress

561
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
at this point because you can no longer

562
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,460
pick up this crystal without exploding

563
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
because you needed the scroll of release.

564
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
The art and animation isn't nearly as good

565
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,460
as in Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.

566
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
It looks okay, but it was quite clearly rushed.

567
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
The game keeps finding excuses

568
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
to not have to lip-sync anyone's mouths.

569
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Are you the people of the dunes?

570
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
I mean no harm to you.

571
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
There are different voice lines for coming back

572
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
to some areas more than once, which means

573
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
the animation with no clear mouth movement can be easily

574
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
reused. I think this is why they did it,

575
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
but it just means the whole game looks

576
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
less good at the expense of being reusable.

577
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,460
What? You again?

578
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
What? You again?

579
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Overall, it's a lot less dynamic

580
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
or fantastical than the other games,

581
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
but since it relies more on decision-making

582
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
than quick reflexes, I can understand the visual change.

583
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Some of the deaths are still pretty funny.

584
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
This might just be

585
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
the only game in history

586
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
where you can be killed by wheat.

587
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Also, the voice acting's pretty good, isn't it?

588
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
Apart from after you kill

589
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
the False King Torlok—remember that name,

590
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
by the way—one of his guards has this to say.

591
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

592
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
For ten years I've waited to see this.

593
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
Thank you, friend!

594
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Nothing says welcome to a realm

595
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
of fantasy and adventure quite like

596
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Kermit the Frog.

597
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
This version is basically just a bunch of video files

598
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
playing in a custom video player.

599
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
If you check the disc's files, even the inventory screens

600
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
are just .mpegs on a loop.

601
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
It's almost clever how they managed to get the old game

602
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
together on a new system, but it's also

603
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
a reminder that the game you're playing is literally

604
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
just a collection of interlocking menus,

605
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,460
like the weird bonus games they used to put on

606
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
early DVD releases of films.

607
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Anyway, after a bit over 30 minutes of trial

608
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
and error—somewhat less than the

609
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
month's dire predicted—I had

610
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
three artifacts and reached the bridge to the fourth

611
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
kingdom, The Far Reaches.

612
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Pass and be warned

613
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
that the southern barbarians roam

614
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
The Far Reaches.

615
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
It is a lawless kingdom now.

616
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Wha—wait, what?

617
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
You have beaten Téa's Quest?

618
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
More challenges await you in Shadowin?

619
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
The sequel to Téa's—

620
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
what? The game ends with a trailer

621
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
for a game called Kingdom Shadowin.

622
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Why does the main character look so different?

623
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
How is there a sequel to a

624
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
game no one played on a console

625
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
that no one bought? How did

626
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,460
playing this game only give me more questions?

627
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Wh—what?

628
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
♪♪

629
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
Okay.

630
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
It turns out there's one more

631
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
twist in the tale of Téa's Quest.

632
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
There's also the twist that it's

633
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
pronounced Théa's Quest,

634
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
but it's too late to re-record

635
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
all the voiceover, so...

636
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
The game was either left unfinished or intended to be

637
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
the first part in a series released hastily

638
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,460
to try to recoup costs for it in the Halcyon,

639
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
with plans to make a sequel before the company

640
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
went bankrupt and the whole endeavor was scrapped.

641
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
While this 2005 CD

642
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,460
is a close to faithful version of the

643
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
original audio and video of the arcade version,

644
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
and also there's a DVD version released

645
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
at the same time just for DVD players

646
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
and there's some more behind-the-scenes footage on it,

647
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
a decade prior, in 1995,

648
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
ten years before this version

649
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,460
and ten years after the original release,

650
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
the game was ported to the 3DO,

651
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,460
the CDI, and DOS PCs

652
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,460
under the name Kingdom the Far

653
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
Reaches. The CDI and

654
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
3DO are basically considered critical and

655
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
commercial failures, but this is perhaps

656
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
the one context where I can't make fun of

657
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
them, because even there a step up from the game's

658
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
previous release on a console that never

659
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
even officially came out.

660
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
God, I feel kind of sorry for Rick Dyer.

661
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
The poor guy kept trying, and it

662
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
kept just not quite working out.

663
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
This version of the game is the one that got the sequel,

664
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Kingdom Shadowun, released a year later

665
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
for the same consoles.

666
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Some versions of Kingdom Part 2

667
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
Shadowun are just called Shadowun

668
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
for some reason. I also picked up a

669
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
copy of Kingdom Book 1 the Far Reaches

670
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
just to see what changes they made apart

671
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,460
from the title. Let's check that out real quick.

672
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
You comin' with me, boy?

673
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
This version uses more compressed graphics,

674
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,460
but also makes a bunch of weird changes.

675
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Along with the title, a bunch of character

676
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
names have changed, too. The Elder Kings

677
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,460
are now the Argent Kings,

678
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Téa Alkenred is now Lathan

679
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Kandor, Druce is now

680
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Daelin, Quode is now

681
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,460
Mobus, and Saucerball is

682
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,460
now Torlok.

683
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Torlok has become Drake's Blood

684
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
the Wicked. Obviously, this means the voice

685
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,460
acting had to be redone by new actors,

686
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
and by actors, I mean whoever Rick Dyer

687
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
got to program this new version got into

688
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
a vocal booth for, like, five minutes.

689
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
Mobus is gone, but the

690
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
one who will come remains.

691
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
I am ready.

692
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I can't verify the quote,

693
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
but apparently Dyer thought

694
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
the original names were

695
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
270s, so he changed them.

696
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
I don't think the names were the problem

697
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
with the original's release. It was probably

698
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
everything else. I can almost

699
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
see Dyer in my head trying his very best

700
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
to step as far as possible

701
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
away from the game's previous incarnation,

702
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,460
given its, frankly, traumatic history.

703
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
The opening sequence is now an optional

704
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
cutscene triggered at the beginning, which

705
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
ends before Druce—sorry, Daelin

706
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
makes you do the stupid bit with the doors.

707
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,460
When you start the game, you get a piece of all-new

708
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,460
animation, which looks kind of bad,

709
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,460
in which Téa—sorry, Lathan

710
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,460
gets told by Daelin about Drake's

711
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,460
blood seizing the throne and how you need three

712
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
artifacts to stop him. This is an interesting

713
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
change. The original game ended

714
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,460
suddenly partway through, and this

715
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,460
cutscene basically rewrites the entire plot

716
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
to be about doing the thing you

717
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
actually end up doing towards the end of the

718
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
actual amount of game they made.

719
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Too much of the game's dialogue references the evil

720
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,460
wizard at the beginning, and he still appears in the game

721
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
to attack you, so they couldn't take

722
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
him out entirely. It's so weird

723
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
to have one opening talk about the evil wizard

724
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,460
who's now called Torlok, and then the

725
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
actual opening tells you your quest is to stop

726
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
a different bad guy who isn't called

727
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Torlok anymore. Like everything

728
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,460
else about the legacy of this game, it's weird

729
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
and esoteric for seemingly no reason.

730
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
Even the name is weird. The Far

731
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Reaches is one of the two kingdoms from the

732
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
original you don't end up going to

733
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
because the game ends on the bridge to visit them.

734
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Why is this version called Kingdom

735
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
The Far Reaches when there's no

736
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
Far Reaches in it, and there's technically

737
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
five kingdoms? That's a plural

738
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
amount of kingdoms. I—I

739
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
wish I hadn't noticed this. It's just frustrating.

740
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
The gameplay is a bit different, too.

741
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
You now click around a map screen to decide where

742
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
to go. The first place you go is Dalen's

743
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
mansion, where the cutscene from going through

744
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
the correct door in the original just sort of

745
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
plays as if you just walked in, and he

746
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
gives you the scrolls. They also added more

747
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
complex puzzles. For example, this guy who just

748
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
talks to you in the first game is now blind,

749
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
and you get a scroll of seeing from Dalen

750
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
to use to get his advice. Dalen

751
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
also asks you which scrolls you want him to work

752
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
on next, so you actually get to make a couple

753
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
more choices than in the original, and the

754
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
use of a main map screen actually makes it feel like

755
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
you're traveling a world. Kind of.

756
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
Slightly. A little bit.

757
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
My son was your age

758
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
when he learned that the cold fire which

759
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
burns on the marsh waste can

760
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
destroy the mist monsters.

761
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,460
They call the land wares the mist

762
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
monsters in this version. It's like

763
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,460
Daya actually got my memo. Now

764
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
the puzzle is decipherable

765
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
by humans. Once you save

766
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,460
the princess, you get the second new cutscene

767
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
that's clearly new animation, where the princess

768
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
says thanks and invites you to stay.

769
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
I accept your gracious offer, princess.

770
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Then,

771
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,460
together, they

772
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
invent fireworks.

773
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,460
Also, there's this really rocking

774
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
track that plays when it's trying to load the credits.

775
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
I think I want this as my new ringtone.

776
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
And the credits roll, and the game ends with the trailer for Shadowin.

777
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,460
So now, after covering

778
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
this new version of the game, we can actually

779
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,460
talk about its sequel. Its animation

780
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
style has been altered significantly, and the character

781
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,460
looks completely different. I have a feeling

782
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,460
Daya and co. wanted to further differentiate

783
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Kingdom from Teya's Quest, and

784
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,460
did so by changing how everything looked when the

785
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
time came to make new animation for this sequel.

786
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Or maybe he just had different animators

787
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,460
at this point. At this point, they probably either

788
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
moved on to bigger projects, or quit

789
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
and become a baker. Working as an

790
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
animator's really hard at the best of times, and

791
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
working on Teya's Quest seemed like it was a nightmare.

792
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
The sequel is basically just more

793
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
of the sort of gameplay from the previous game.

794
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
You get the other two relics, and finally,

795
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
after over a decade of waiting,

796
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
you get to kill Torlok.

797
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Oh, come on. That was it? And then

798
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
Lathan kisses the princess from the first game,

799
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
and fireworks go off again, but there's more this time.

800
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
And credits.

801
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,460
Where do we go from around every turn?

802
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Why did I make this?

803
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
Well, maybe

804
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
because it's an interesting story.

805
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
An immensely popular game that went away

806
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
so quickly that its successor was all but forgotten.

807
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,460
A recklessly optimistic

808
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
console in a period when home gaming

809
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
was hemorrhaging money that never even made it out the

810
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
door, and a relentless barrage

811
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
of unpronounceable names.

812
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
In June, this warehouse will come to life.

813
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
The new home video system that Rick and Jan

814
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Dyer have banked everything on will be shipped

815
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
from here. My wife and I, as you probably

816
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,460
can guess, are gambling everything

817
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,460
we own on this, so

818
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
it's kind of scary,

819
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
but that's the sort of thing that makes you want to

820
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
succeed. Rick and his wife threw

821
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
everything they had into Halcyon,

822
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
and Halcyon took it all, took

823
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
everything, and then it was gone,

824
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
leaving them as barely a footnote

825
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
in the history of video games. Maybe

826
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
it's because I think Don Bluth is overrated,

827
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
and I find his continued attempts to revive

828
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Dragon's Lair to be a little bit crass,

829
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
and wanted to talk about the game's actual creator

830
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
instead of the man who keeps getting the credit.

831
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,460
If you type Rick Dyer into

832
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Wikipedia, you get a disambiguation

833
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,460
page linking to two possible

834
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
notable Rick Dyers. One of them is

835
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
ours, the video game designer. His

836
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
page is three short paragraphs

837
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
in length. The second is titled

838
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Rick Dyer, and then in brackets,

839
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Bigfoot.

840
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
Some guy who spread Bigfoot hoaxes

841
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
is remembered in more detail

842
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
than the inventor of Dragon's Lair.

843
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Or maybe it's because the way

844
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
modern gaming's going right now, I'm a little

845
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,460
bit worried. The marketplace is only

846
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
getting bigger, and the tools of game

847
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
creation are more available than ever before,

848
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
and that means there's a lot more games competing

849
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
for people's attention. There may not be

850
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
another crash, but it's still a very

851
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,460
big pool for a small fish.

852
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
In any creative medium, it's scary

853
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
to work knowing that what you create

854
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,460
may only exist in permanent obscurity.

855
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,460
The people who make it might be talented,

856
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
but increasingly, they're also very

857
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
lucky. Undertale got recognized

858
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,460
because Toby Fox was in the right place at the

859
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
right time with an already existing following

860
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
around his Homestuck music. Dragon's Lair

861
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
did well partially on the back of that name

862
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
they put all over it. The next designer with

863
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
the talent Toby Fox had

864
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
might not be so lucky.

865
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
The ancient Romans used to tell the story of a man

866
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
called Romulus, a fantastical

867
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
figure descended from royalty,

868
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,460
raised by wolves who took part in all

869
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
the most important foundational

870
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
events in Roman history, and

871
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
named Rome after himself.

872
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
The Romans looked at their society and liked to

873
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
imagine that it had all been the plan

874
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
of some great genius.

875
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
The Romans believed in dozens of

876
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
mythical engines of creation.

877
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
What was one more?

878
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Hundreds of incredible works of art have been done of

879
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
epic historical events, huge

880
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
important moments in history,

881
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
the actions of gods or supposed

882
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
men like Romulus.

883
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
One of my favorite paintings is The Lacemaker.

884
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
Johan Vermeer painted a

885
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
loving, accurate, and detailed rendition

886
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
of a girl making

887
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
lace. Vermeer celebrated

888
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
real people doing ordinary

889
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
things. He offered the

890
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
radical idea that you didn't have to be

891
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
special or important or magical

892
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
or legendary to be worth

893
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
being painted or thought about

894
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
or remembered. So it turns out

895
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
there are two ways of explaining history.

896
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
We can be like Geoffrey of Monmouth or the

897
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
early Romans and invent these

898
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
magical, wondrous, brilliant people

899
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
who gave everything to us.

900
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
A wizard made Stonehenge all by himself.

901
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
A man called Romulus

902
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
invented Rome out of whole cloth

903
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
and took part in every major historical

904
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
event required to fulfill his

905
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
amazing design.

906
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
John Bluth made Dragon's Lair.

907
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
Or we can be like Vermeer.

908
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
A bunch of ordinary,

909
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
everyday people built Stonehenge just by

910
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
working together and putting time and effort

911
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
into it. A bunch of ordinary

912
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
people make video games by working

913
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
together very hard for hours and hours

914
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
and hours and days and years to make

915
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
it. A bunch of regular, ordinary

916
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
people built Rome over the span of a

917
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
very long time, contributing

918
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
to what would later be remembered as the

919
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
exploits of one man. This way is

920
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,460
nowhere near as magical as the ones we like to

921
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
imagine put our world together.

922
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
The truth is often very mundane.

923
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
But maybe that's okay.

924
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
We're pioneers.

925
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
We're doing something that's never been done.

926
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
We have artists, we have writers, we have engineers,

927
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
we have technicians.

928
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
They're all working together and that has never

929
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
existed before. There's never really been a reason

930
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
for those three groups

931
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
to all coexist simultaneously.

932
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
What we're really

933
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,460
doing is combining art with science.

934
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
I think there's something sad but

935
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
beautiful about Rick Dyer and his dreams

936
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
of Halcyon. He calls himself

937
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
and his team pioneers in this news

938
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
broadcast, and the truth is

939
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
he's right. Pioneer

940
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
isn't an inherently positive term.

941
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
It just means you were among the first to explore

942
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
something, and that doesn't mean you were successful

943
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
or right. A lot of early pioneers

944
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
didn't make it back, and a lot

945
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
of people, a lot of us,

946
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
are going to end up more like Rick Dyer

947
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
than we'd hoped to be. So if we

948
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,460
can't learn to love and remember people like

949
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Rick, we're condemning ourselves

950
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,460
in turn to be forgotten.

951
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
Your work might not

952
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,460
reach the audience it deserved, or you

953
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
might not make something anyone likes,

954
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
and it can be soul-crushing to embark on

955
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,460
a journey knowing you might not succeed.

956
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
But if we can learn to accept

957
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
that it's okay to try and fail,

958
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
and that people who fail are worth being remembered

959
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
and appreciated, then maybe we can

960
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
all at least learn to enjoy

961
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
the humanizing experience of failure

962
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
together.

963
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
Thank you for watching.

964
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
This video was quite a lot

965
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
of time in the making, and I can only do things

966
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460

967
