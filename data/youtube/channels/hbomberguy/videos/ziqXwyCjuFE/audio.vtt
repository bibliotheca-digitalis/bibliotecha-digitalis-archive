00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
While I wait for the votes on the previous video to tally up, I thought I'd make a

00:06.960 --> 00:09.800
quick video about Darkest Dungeon.

00:09.800 --> 00:19.160
Don't let the game's well-drawn, well-animated, well-voiced opening fool you.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.480
This game's story isn't anything about reclaiming your old home and clearing your

00:22.480 --> 00:24.080
family's debt to history.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.600
This game's story is about being an HR manager for the worst business in the world.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.840
Let's talk about Ludo Narrative.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.680
Looks like a big, scary, pretentious word idiots use in think pieces, doesn't it?

00:33.680 --> 00:36.320
Well, don't worry, let me translate it for you.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.480
Narrative means narrative, and Ludo is Latin for I play.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.080
Play story doesn't sound nearly as smart, does it?

00:43.080 --> 00:46.800
Basically, it's when the emotional effect of the game on the player is the real story,

00:46.800 --> 00:49.420
and the setting and plot amount mostly to set dressing.

00:49.420 --> 00:53.720
All games have a Ludo narrative of sorts, but not all of them make it their actual focus.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.360
Darkest Dungeon's typical loop is you build a party, venture forth into a dungeon, crawl

00:57.360 --> 01:01.360
room-to-room fighting bad guys, get scared, get hurt, collect identical busts of the same

01:01.360 --> 01:04.680
guy, accidentally walk into traps because the movement system's a little bit too finicky

01:04.680 --> 01:07.080
sometimes, and make heroic speeches around a campfire.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.600
Then you leave with your loot and use the money to upgrade your stuff and go to harder places.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.840
But none of this is the actual game.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.360
It looks nice, and the battle engine is fairly complex, but it's never really in doubt

01:16.360 --> 01:19.760
what the best move is in any given circumstance, at least in my opinion.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.480
The battles boil down to, do you want to deal a lot of damage to a guy, deal less damage

01:23.480 --> 01:27.280
to several guys, inflict bleed on one or more guys, causing them to lose health over time,

01:27.280 --> 01:31.880
inflict Blight on them, which does the same thing but better, or stun someone so they can't stab you.

01:31.880 --> 01:35.000
If you know basic maths, there's always a pretty obvious choice.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
If this was the game, it wouldn't be out of place on the iPhone App Store.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.080
That's not an insult, it's just not that complex of an RPG if you take the battle system alone.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.600
The real game is everything outside of the dungeons.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.560
While it's always obvious what the best move is in any given battle, your band of mercenaries

01:48.560 --> 01:50.280
have to be picked by you.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.640
Their placement in the party order has to be picked, which affects what moves they can do

01:53.640 --> 01:54.800
and who they can do them to.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.920
The items they enter the dungeon with have to be picked.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.440
It's possible to let a good party go completely to hell because you didn't give them enough

02:00.440 --> 02:04.720
bandages or shovels or torches and they got stuck digging through the rock with their bare hands,

02:04.720 --> 02:06.360
bleeding to death in the dark.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.760
You can be really good at knowing when to do bleed, when to do Blight, when to stun,

02:09.760 --> 02:12.480
and when to hit people with your axe, sword, mace, or dog,

02:12.480 --> 02:16.080
but if you didn't bring enough torches, all of these poor people you sent in to do your work

02:16.080 --> 02:17.440
are probably gonna die.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.040
Oh, also, all of your employees get stressed.

02:20.040 --> 02:20.840
Idiots.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.000
Don't they know some people have to work three jobs?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.320
God, they're so dramatic.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.960
And guess what? If their stress gets too high,

02:25.960 --> 02:30.000
they freak out and can develop some seriously messed-up reactions that make it really difficult to work with them.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.000
Kevin!

02:31.440 --> 02:32.600
Kev- Kev- Stop it!

02:33.280 --> 02:34.040
Kevin!

02:34.040 --> 02:36.040
And if they get too stressed out, they'll die.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.560
So you can't bring your best, most experienced people into every fight because they'll go mad,

02:39.560 --> 02:42.520
harass their friends, and die of a heart attack like me in Fast Forward.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.160
So you have to put them on standby in a bar, getting drunk, or gambling away your money,

02:46.160 --> 02:50.440
or praying in a church and donating your money to the church before deciding they want to pray forever

02:50.440 --> 02:51.960
and now they're never gonna leave.

02:51.960 --> 02:55.160
And even when you have all this under control, the characters all have quirks.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.840
A lot of these are simple gameplay stuff.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.960
Simpsons' Hentai is a ruins explorer, so she's better in the ruins levels,

02:59.960 --> 03:03.800
and Mii is a wheeled adventurer, so he's 15% better in the...

03:03.800 --> 03:05.800
wheeled... whatever that is.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.120
What is a wheeled?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.040
I have no idea what a wheeled is.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.960
But a lot of these quirks are a little more personal.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.680
Some people are known to cheat, so they can't gamble to reduce stress,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.880
and some will only gamble, which is arguably an even worse problem in the long run,

03:16.880 --> 03:19.280
and some are super religious, so they'll only meditate,

03:19.280 --> 03:24.200
which is a huge problem if the one place you can meditate is taken up by someone who refuses to leave.

03:24.200 --> 03:29.200
And as they fight, even if they do well when they level up, they don't always gain positive traits.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.120
They can also gain negative ones.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.040
So as your people get stronger, they get harder to work with,

03:34.040 --> 03:37.600
and curing these negative traits costs money and time you don't have,

03:37.600 --> 03:42.080
because you have to keep questing to get more stuff to make your blacksmith able to upgrade everyone's weapons

03:42.080 --> 03:46.400
so your other guys who need rest will have the equipment to go on their quest when they get better from the last one.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.160
So you have to bring a kleptomaniac along so they can carry the rest of the team

03:50.160 --> 03:54.200
and just hope that their need to relentlessly touch everything doesn't get everyone killed.

03:54.200 --> 03:58.280
And when someone does die, more people are always waiting in the winks to replace them,

03:58.280 --> 04:00.600
bringing with them their own host of problems.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.200
It's terrifying.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.760
What is he gonna do with his dog?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.440
This is the Ludonarrative.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.160
It makes you feel like a real manager of people in a tense situation,

04:10.160 --> 04:12.200
learning their intricacies and personal problems,

04:12.200 --> 04:14.640
doing the best you can to patch them up, make them feel better,

04:14.640 --> 04:19.000
and, with a little luck, keep them alive long enough to gain ground in the battle against darkness.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.880
It's a long and difficult fight with highs and lows,

04:21.880 --> 04:26.240
but for every time someone goes down or gets so stressed out they become a raging shitheel,

04:26.240 --> 04:29.480
there are times when someone's stress gets tested, and they persevere,

04:29.480 --> 04:34.360
and continue beyond the limits of your expectations and prove to be a true hero in the face of danger,

04:34.360 --> 04:36.000
turning the tide completely.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.520
You get invested in this struggle and learning to think like you're dealing with real people

04:39.520 --> 04:43.920
marshalling this ever more insane workforce into performing a truly grueling task.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.280
The dramatic tale of your ancestors' failings you unlock over the course of the game

04:47.280 --> 04:51.320
pales in comparison to wondering if Tilly will ever come back from his drunken bender,

04:51.320 --> 04:54.840
or wondering what the horrors of battle will have done to Simpsons' hentai this week.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.680
Oh, great. What did you get this time?

04:57.960 --> 05:01.400
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:02.040 --> 05:05.680
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:06.160 --> 05:13.200
Oh, my God. Video games. Video games!

05:13.200 --> 05:17.040
But seriously, this game makes you invested in these people's existence

05:17.040 --> 05:19.280
and genuinely worry if they'll pull through.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.400
All the stats and numbers and mechanics seem to melt away,

05:22.400 --> 05:25.440
resulting in this personalized, freeform story.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.640
It's great.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.680
Rather than have a story of pre-planned character interactions

05:29.680 --> 05:32.480
to passively troll through and make arbitrary decisions on,

05:32.480 --> 05:35.360
the game spews forth an intricate web of mechanics

05:35.360 --> 05:38.640
that forces you mentally into the role of a character.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.520
It's a very rare game that even attempts this,

05:41.520 --> 05:45.600
and seeing it achieved so well warms my cold, dead heart.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.080
I have one major issue with Darkest Dungeon, though.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.320
It does all this well enough that its problems become more glaring than in other games.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.120
We've established that the actual game is about working with people

05:55.120 --> 05:59.120
and getting that feeling on an emotional level of trying to manage a team, right?

05:59.120 --> 06:01.760
Well, for a game that does this, it relies a little too much

06:01.760 --> 06:04.960
on relating these people to you with cold, hard numbers and facts.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.360
People aren't easy to pin down.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.280
People are unexpected and surprising,

06:09.280 --> 06:12.640
which is why some aspects of the quirk system feel underexplored.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.920
Real-life people don't just have alcoholic written into their souls.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.760
It's a little too mechanical and clunky

06:17.760 --> 06:20.320
for a game that really focuses on these personal foibles.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.480
It's also too easy to work around.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.400
It just means you relieve their stress somewhere else,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.600
or don't take them to the place where the thing that hurts them more lives.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.560
It's still very good at creating the feeling of trying to work with people

06:30.560 --> 06:31.920
with problems and get around them,

06:31.920 --> 06:34.400
but at times it feels a little too mechanistic.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.440
But even then, that's not all that negative.

06:37.440 --> 06:41.040
That design decision brings a feeling of its own to the ludonarrative.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.680
Perhaps treating people like they can be easily reduced

06:43.680 --> 06:45.440
to a short list of good and bad points

06:45.440 --> 06:49.200
is an effect of fighting in a war where people's lives are expendable.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.960
In a sense, it replicates what it must be like to be in a situation like this,

06:52.960 --> 06:55.200
and trying to just keep everyone going.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.760
You start to treat humans a bit less like people,

06:57.760 --> 06:59.680
and a bit more like statistics.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.160
The game with arguably the best ludonarrative ever,

07:02.160 --> 07:04.480
besides the otherwise underwhelming Bioshock games,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.360
is Papers, Please, which manages this really well.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.000
It's a game that teaches you to compromise your own morality

07:10.000 --> 07:11.360
in favor of following the rules,

07:11.360 --> 07:14.080
or simply trying to increase your own chances of survival,

07:14.080 --> 07:15.600
but unlike Darkest Dungeon,

07:15.600 --> 07:18.480
it manages to be messy and human at the same time.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.480
This woman's passport has a misprint on it.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.880
She's done nothing wrong, and you can just refuse her entry,

07:22.880 --> 07:24.960
but you can also have her arrested,

07:24.960 --> 07:27.440
and the guard who arrests people gets a bonus when you do it,

07:27.440 --> 07:29.360
and he's offered to share his bonus with you

07:29.360 --> 07:30.400
if you detain more people,

07:30.400 --> 07:32.640
which you could use to keep your family warm and fed,

07:32.640 --> 07:33.280
so you do it.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.760
You let this poor woman get into a whole heap of trouble

07:37.760 --> 07:38.720
for your own survival.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.600
The next day, the guard tells you his wife was sick,

07:41.600 --> 07:43.280
and he had to spend the money on the medicine

07:43.280 --> 07:45.520
so he can't share his bonus with you this time.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.200
You detained that woman for nothing.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.240
I felt genuinely bad when this happened.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.440
Like, bad on the inside, where my heart should be.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.480
I made that choice.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.720
I didn't have to, but I did.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.600
The game avoids merely listing the rules out to you

07:59.600 --> 08:01.200
for what money you can get and how,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.680
and throws curveballs where sometimes

08:03.680 --> 08:05.360
you don't get what you're told you'd get,

08:05.360 --> 08:08.160
or a day suddenly gets cut short by a terrorist attack

08:08.160 --> 08:09.360
so you don't make much money,

08:09.360 --> 08:11.360
and you get stretched a little bit thinner.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.560
In being willing to compromise its own rule set,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.760
it accurately simulates the feeling of being in turbulent times

08:17.760 --> 08:19.440
where nothing is certain.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.200
Papers, Please is depressing and confusing and wonderful.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.840
That's not to say that Darkest Dungeon is bad,

08:25.840 --> 08:28.320
or even that I would change anything about it at all,

08:28.320 --> 08:31.280
but I think there's also room for a game like Darkest Dungeon,

08:31.280 --> 08:32.720
not necessarily an RPG,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.680
where characters' flaws are all a little harder to pin down,

08:35.680 --> 08:38.400
forcing you to detective out each character's deal

08:38.400 --> 08:41.200
and react to it in ways that feel more natural.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.280
If I wasn't already working on a game right now,

08:45.280 --> 08:49.040
I would probably try to make something that incorporates that idea somewhere.

08:49.040 --> 08:49.920
Maybe in the future.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.120
Thanks very much for watching.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.760
Uh, please check out—my knee just cracked.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.200
Thanks very much for watching,

08:59.200 --> 09:05.840
and, uh, please check out my previous video about the—the Braid game,

09:05.840 --> 09:10.400
and at the end you can vote on it, on what the next video is.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.240
You should probably go and do that if you haven't.

09:12.240 --> 09:12.880
Thanks.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.880
Bye!
