0	6960	While I wait for the votes on the previous video to tally up, I thought I'd make a
6960	9800	quick video about Darkest Dungeon.
9800	19160	Don't let the game's well-drawn, well-animated, well-voiced opening fool you.
19160	22480	This game's story isn't anything about reclaiming your old home and clearing your
22480	24080	family's debt to history.
24080	27600	This game's story is about being an HR manager for the worst business in the world.
27600	29840	Let's talk about Ludo Narrative.
29840	33680	Looks like a big, scary, pretentious word idiots use in think pieces, doesn't it?
33680	36320	Well, don't worry, let me translate it for you.
36320	40480	Narrative means narrative, and Ludo is Latin for I play.
40480	43080	Play story doesn't sound nearly as smart, does it?
43080	46800	Basically, it's when the emotional effect of the game on the player is the real story,
46800	49420	and the setting and plot amount mostly to set dressing.
49420	53720	All games have a Ludo narrative of sorts, but not all of them make it their actual focus.
53720	57360	Darkest Dungeon's typical loop is you build a party, venture forth into a dungeon, crawl
57360	61360	room-to-room fighting bad guys, get scared, get hurt, collect identical busts of the same
61360	64680	guy, accidentally walk into traps because the movement system's a little bit too finicky
64680	67080	sometimes, and make heroic speeches around a campfire.
67080	70600	Then you leave with your loot and use the money to upgrade your stuff and go to harder places.
70600	72840	But none of this is the actual game.
72840	76360	It looks nice, and the battle engine is fairly complex, but it's never really in doubt
76360	79760	what the best move is in any given circumstance, at least in my opinion.
79760	83480	The battles boil down to, do you want to deal a lot of damage to a guy, deal less damage
83480	87280	to several guys, inflict bleed on one or more guys, causing them to lose health over time,
87280	91880	inflict Blight on them, which does the same thing but better, or stun someone so they can't stab you.
91880	95000	If you know basic maths, there's always a pretty obvious choice.
95000	98000	If this was the game, it wouldn't be out of place on the iPhone App Store.
98000	102080	That's not an insult, it's just not that complex of an RPG if you take the battle system alone.
102080	104600	The real game is everything outside of the dungeons.
104600	108560	While it's always obvious what the best move is in any given battle, your band of mercenaries
108560	110280	have to be picked by you.
110280	113640	Their placement in the party order has to be picked, which affects what moves they can do
113640	114800	and who they can do them to.
114800	116920	The items they enter the dungeon with have to be picked.
116920	120440	It's possible to let a good party go completely to hell because you didn't give them enough
120440	124720	bandages or shovels or torches and they got stuck digging through the rock with their bare hands,
124720	126360	bleeding to death in the dark.
126360	129760	You can be really good at knowing when to do bleed, when to do Blight, when to stun,
129760	132480	and when to hit people with your axe, sword, mace, or dog,
132480	136080	but if you didn't bring enough torches, all of these poor people you sent in to do your work
136080	137440	are probably gonna die.
137440	140040	Oh, also, all of your employees get stressed.
140040	140840	Idiots.
140840	143000	Don't they know some people have to work three jobs?
143000	144320	God, they're so dramatic.
144320	145960	And guess what? If their stress gets too high,
145960	150000	they freak out and can develop some seriously messed-up reactions that make it really difficult to work with them.
150480	151000	Kevin!
151440	152600	Kev- Kev- Stop it!
153280	154040	Kevin!
154040	156040	And if they get too stressed out, they'll die.
156040	159560	So you can't bring your best, most experienced people into every fight because they'll go mad,
159560	162520	harass their friends, and die of a heart attack like me in Fast Forward.
162520	166160	So you have to put them on standby in a bar, getting drunk, or gambling away your money,
166160	170440	or praying in a church and donating your money to the church before deciding they want to pray forever
170440	171960	and now they're never gonna leave.
171960	175160	And even when you have all this under control, the characters all have quirks.
175160	176840	A lot of these are simple gameplay stuff.
176840	179960	Simpsons' Hentai is a ruins explorer, so she's better in the ruins levels,
179960	183800	and Mii is a wheeled adventurer, so he's 15% better in the...
183800	185800	wheeled... whatever that is.
185800	187120	What is a wheeled?
187120	189040	I have no idea what a wheeled is.
189040	190960	But a lot of these quirks are a little more personal.
190960	193680	Some people are known to cheat, so they can't gamble to reduce stress,
193680	196880	and some will only gamble, which is arguably an even worse problem in the long run,
196880	199280	and some are super religious, so they'll only meditate,
199280	204200	which is a huge problem if the one place you can meditate is taken up by someone who refuses to leave.
204200	209200	And as they fight, even if they do well when they level up, they don't always gain positive traits.
209200	211120	They can also gain negative ones.
211120	214040	So as your people get stronger, they get harder to work with,
214040	217600	and curing these negative traits costs money and time you don't have,
217600	222080	because you have to keep questing to get more stuff to make your blacksmith able to upgrade everyone's weapons
222080	226400	so your other guys who need rest will have the equipment to go on their quest when they get better from the last one.
226400	230160	So you have to bring a kleptomaniac along so they can carry the rest of the team
230160	234200	and just hope that their need to relentlessly touch everything doesn't get everyone killed.
234200	238280	And when someone does die, more people are always waiting in the winks to replace them,
238280	240600	bringing with them their own host of problems.
240960	242200	It's terrifying.
242200	244760	What is he gonna do with his dog?
244760	246440	This is the Ludonarrative.
246440	250160	It makes you feel like a real manager of people in a tense situation,
250160	252200	learning their intricacies and personal problems,
252200	254640	doing the best you can to patch them up, make them feel better,
254640	259000	and, with a little luck, keep them alive long enough to gain ground in the battle against darkness.
259000	261880	It's a long and difficult fight with highs and lows,
261880	266240	but for every time someone goes down or gets so stressed out they become a raging shitheel,
266240	269480	there are times when someone's stress gets tested, and they persevere,
269480	274360	and continue beyond the limits of your expectations and prove to be a true hero in the face of danger,
274360	276000	turning the tide completely.
276000	279520	You get invested in this struggle and learning to think like you're dealing with real people
279520	283920	marshalling this ever more insane workforce into performing a truly grueling task.
284000	287280	The dramatic tale of your ancestors' failings you unlock over the course of the game
287280	291320	pales in comparison to wondering if Tilly will ever come back from his drunken bender,
291320	294840	or wondering what the horrors of battle will have done to Simpsons' hentai this week.
294840	296680	Oh, great. What did you get this time?
297960	301400	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
302040	305680	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
306160	313200	Oh, my God. Video games. Video games!
313200	317040	But seriously, this game makes you invested in these people's existence
317040	319280	and genuinely worry if they'll pull through.
319280	322400	All the stats and numbers and mechanics seem to melt away,
322400	325440	resulting in this personalized, freeform story.
325440	326640	It's great.
326640	329680	Rather than have a story of pre-planned character interactions
329680	332480	to passively troll through and make arbitrary decisions on,
332480	335360	the game spews forth an intricate web of mechanics
335360	338640	that forces you mentally into the role of a character.
338640	341520	It's a very rare game that even attempts this,
341520	345600	and seeing it achieved so well warms my cold, dead heart.
345600	348080	I have one major issue with Darkest Dungeon, though.
348080	352320	It does all this well enough that its problems become more glaring than in other games.
352320	355120	We've established that the actual game is about working with people
355120	359120	and getting that feeling on an emotional level of trying to manage a team, right?
359120	361760	Well, for a game that does this, it relies a little too much
361760	364960	on relating these people to you with cold, hard numbers and facts.
365760	367360	People aren't easy to pin down.
367360	369280	People are unexpected and surprising,
369280	372640	which is why some aspects of the quirk system feel underexplored.
372640	375920	Real-life people don't just have alcoholic written into their souls.
375920	377760	It's a little too mechanical and clunky
377760	380320	for a game that really focuses on these personal foibles.
380960	382480	It's also too easy to work around.
382480	384400	It just means you relieve their stress somewhere else,
384400	387600	or don't take them to the place where the thing that hurts them more lives.
387600	390560	It's still very good at creating the feeling of trying to work with people
390560	391920	with problems and get around them,
391920	394400	but at times it feels a little too mechanistic.
394960	397440	But even then, that's not all that negative.
397440	401040	That design decision brings a feeling of its own to the ludonarrative.
401040	403680	Perhaps treating people like they can be easily reduced
403680	405440	to a short list of good and bad points
405440	409200	is an effect of fighting in a war where people's lives are expendable.
409200	412960	In a sense, it replicates what it must be like to be in a situation like this,
412960	415200	and trying to just keep everyone going.
415200	417760	You start to treat humans a bit less like people,
417760	419680	and a bit more like statistics.
419680	422160	The game with arguably the best ludonarrative ever,
422160	424480	besides the otherwise underwhelming Bioshock games,
424480	427360	is Papers, Please, which manages this really well.
427360	430000	It's a game that teaches you to compromise your own morality
430000	431360	in favor of following the rules,
431360	434080	or simply trying to increase your own chances of survival,
434080	435600	but unlike Darkest Dungeon,
435600	438480	it manages to be messy and human at the same time.
438480	440480	This woman's passport has a misprint on it.
440480	442880	She's done nothing wrong, and you can just refuse her entry,
442880	444960	but you can also have her arrested,
444960	447440	and the guard who arrests people gets a bonus when you do it,
447440	449360	and he's offered to share his bonus with you
449360	450400	if you detain more people,
450400	452640	which you could use to keep your family warm and fed,
452640	453280	so you do it.
455360	457760	You let this poor woman get into a whole heap of trouble
457760	458720	for your own survival.
459280	461600	The next day, the guard tells you his wife was sick,
461600	463280	and he had to spend the money on the medicine
463280	465520	so he can't share his bonus with you this time.
465520	467200	You detained that woman for nothing.
467920	470240	I felt genuinely bad when this happened.
470240	473440	Like, bad on the inside, where my heart should be.
473440	474480	I made that choice.
474960	476720	I didn't have to, but I did.
476720	479600	The game avoids merely listing the rules out to you
479600	481200	for what money you can get and how,
481200	483680	and throws curveballs where sometimes
483680	485360	you don't get what you're told you'd get,
485360	488160	or a day suddenly gets cut short by a terrorist attack
488160	489360	so you don't make much money,
489360	491360	and you get stretched a little bit thinner.
492080	494560	In being willing to compromise its own rule set,
494560	497760	it accurately simulates the feeling of being in turbulent times
497760	499440	where nothing is certain.
499440	503200	Papers, Please is depressing and confusing and wonderful.
503840	505840	That's not to say that Darkest Dungeon is bad,
505840	508320	or even that I would change anything about it at all,
508320	511280	but I think there's also room for a game like Darkest Dungeon,
511280	512720	not necessarily an RPG,
512720	515680	where characters' flaws are all a little harder to pin down,
515680	518400	forcing you to detective out each character's deal
518400	521200	and react to it in ways that feel more natural.
521200	523280	If I wasn't already working on a game right now,
525280	529040	I would probably try to make something that incorporates that idea somewhere.
529040	529920	Maybe in the future.
534080	535120	Thanks very much for watching.
535120	537760	Uh, please check out—my knee just cracked.
537760	539200	Thanks very much for watching,
539200	545840	and, uh, please check out my previous video about the—the Braid game,
545840	550400	and at the end you can vote on it, on what the next video is.
550400	552240	You should probably go and do that if you haven't.
552240	552880	Thanks.
552880	554880	Bye!
