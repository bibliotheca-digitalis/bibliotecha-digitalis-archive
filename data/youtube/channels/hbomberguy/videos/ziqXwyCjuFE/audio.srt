1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
While I wait for the votes on the previous video to tally up, I thought I'd make a

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,800
quick video about Darkest Dungeon.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:19,160
Don't let the game's well-drawn, well-animated, well-voiced opening fool you.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,480
This game's story isn't anything about reclaiming your old home and clearing your

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,080
family's debt to history.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,600
This game's story is about being an HR manager for the worst business in the world.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,840
Let's talk about Ludo Narrative.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,680
Looks like a big, scary, pretentious word idiots use in think pieces, doesn't it?

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
Well, don't worry, let me translate it for you.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
Narrative means narrative, and Ludo is Latin for I play.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,080
Play story doesn't sound nearly as smart, does it?

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,800
Basically, it's when the emotional effect of the game on the player is the real story,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,420
and the setting and plot amount mostly to set dressing.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,720
All games have a Ludo narrative of sorts, but not all of them make it their actual focus.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,360
Darkest Dungeon's typical loop is you build a party, venture forth into a dungeon, crawl

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,360
room-to-room fighting bad guys, get scared, get hurt, collect identical busts of the same

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,680
guy, accidentally walk into traps because the movement system's a little bit too finicky

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
sometimes, and make heroic speeches around a campfire.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,600
Then you leave with your loot and use the money to upgrade your stuff and go to harder places.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,840
But none of this is the actual game.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,360
It looks nice, and the battle engine is fairly complex, but it's never really in doubt

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,760
what the best move is in any given circumstance, at least in my opinion.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,480
The battles boil down to, do you want to deal a lot of damage to a guy, deal less damage

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,280
to several guys, inflict bleed on one or more guys, causing them to lose health over time,

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,880
inflict Blight on them, which does the same thing but better, or stun someone so they can't stab you.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,000
If you know basic maths, there's always a pretty obvious choice.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If this was the game, it wouldn't be out of place on the iPhone App Store.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,080
That's not an insult, it's just not that complex of an RPG if you take the battle system alone.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,600
The real game is everything outside of the dungeons.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,560
While it's always obvious what the best move is in any given battle, your band of mercenaries

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,280
have to be picked by you.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,640
Their placement in the party order has to be picked, which affects what moves they can do

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,800
and who they can do them to.

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,920
The items they enter the dungeon with have to be picked.

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,440
It's possible to let a good party go completely to hell because you didn't give them enough

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,720
bandages or shovels or torches and they got stuck digging through the rock with their bare hands,

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,360
bleeding to death in the dark.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,760
You can be really good at knowing when to do bleed, when to do Blight, when to stun,

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,480
and when to hit people with your axe, sword, mace, or dog,

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
but if you didn't bring enough torches, all of these poor people you sent in to do your work

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
are probably gonna die.

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,040
Oh, also, all of your employees get stressed.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,840
Idiots.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't they know some people have to work three jobs?

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,320
God, they're so dramatic.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,960
And guess what? If their stress gets too high,

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,000
they freak out and can develop some seriously messed-up reactions that make it really difficult to work with them.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Kevin!

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,600
Kev- Kev- Stop it!

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
Kevin!

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,040
And if they get too stressed out, they'll die.

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,560
So you can't bring your best, most experienced people into every fight because they'll go mad,

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,520
harass their friends, and die of a heart attack like me in Fast Forward.

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,160
So you have to put them on standby in a bar, getting drunk, or gambling away your money,

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,440
or praying in a church and donating your money to the church before deciding they want to pray forever

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,960
and now they're never gonna leave.

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,160
And even when you have all this under control, the characters all have quirks.

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
A lot of these are simple gameplay stuff.

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,960
Simpsons' Hentai is a ruins explorer, so she's better in the ruins levels,

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,800
and Mii is a wheeled adventurer, so he's 15% better in the...

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
wheeled... whatever that is.

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,120
What is a wheeled?

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
I have no idea what a wheeled is.

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,960
But a lot of these quirks are a little more personal.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Some people are known to cheat, so they can't gamble to reduce stress,

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,880
and some will only gamble, which is arguably an even worse problem in the long run,

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,280
and some are super religious, so they'll only meditate,

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,200
which is a huge problem if the one place you can meditate is taken up by someone who refuses to leave.

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,200
And as they fight, even if they do well when they level up, they don't always gain positive traits.

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
They can also gain negative ones.

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,040
So as your people get stronger, they get harder to work with,

72
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,600
and curing these negative traits costs money and time you don't have,

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,080
because you have to keep questing to get more stuff to make your blacksmith able to upgrade everyone's weapons

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
so your other guys who need rest will have the equipment to go on their quest when they get better from the last one.

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,160
So you have to bring a kleptomaniac along so they can carry the rest of the team

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,200
and just hope that their need to relentlessly touch everything doesn't get everyone killed.

77
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,280
And when someone does die, more people are always waiting in the winks to replace them,

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,600
bringing with them their own host of problems.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,200
It's terrifying.

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,760
What is he gonna do with his dog?

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,440
This is the Ludonarrative.

82
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,160
It makes you feel like a real manager of people in a tense situation,

83
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,200
learning their intricacies and personal problems,

84
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,640
doing the best you can to patch them up, make them feel better,

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,000
and, with a little luck, keep them alive long enough to gain ground in the battle against darkness.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,880
It's a long and difficult fight with highs and lows,

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,240
but for every time someone goes down or gets so stressed out they become a raging shitheel,

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,480
there are times when someone's stress gets tested, and they persevere,

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,360
and continue beyond the limits of your expectations and prove to be a true hero in the face of danger,

90
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
turning the tide completely.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
You get invested in this struggle and learning to think like you're dealing with real people

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,920
marshalling this ever more insane workforce into performing a truly grueling task.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
The dramatic tale of your ancestors' failings you unlock over the course of the game

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,320
pales in comparison to wondering if Tilly will ever come back from his drunken bender,

95
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,840
or wondering what the horrors of battle will have done to Simpsons' hentai this week.

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,680
Oh, great. What did you get this time?

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,680
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh, my God. Video games. Video games!

100
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,040
But seriously, this game makes you invested in these people's existence

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,280
and genuinely worry if they'll pull through.

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,400
All the stats and numbers and mechanics seem to melt away,

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
resulting in this personalized, freeform story.

104
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
It's great.

105
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,680
Rather than have a story of pre-planned character interactions

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,480
to passively troll through and make arbitrary decisions on,

107
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,360
the game spews forth an intricate web of mechanics

108
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,640
that forces you mentally into the role of a character.

109
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,520
It's a very rare game that even attempts this,

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,600
and seeing it achieved so well warms my cold, dead heart.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
I have one major issue with Darkest Dungeon, though.

112
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
It does all this well enough that its problems become more glaring than in other games.

113
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,120
We've established that the actual game is about working with people

114
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
and getting that feeling on an emotional level of trying to manage a team, right?

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,760
Well, for a game that does this, it relies a little too much

116
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,960
on relating these people to you with cold, hard numbers and facts.

117
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,360
People aren't easy to pin down.

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
People are unexpected and surprising,

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,640
which is why some aspects of the quirk system feel underexplored.

120
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,920
Real-life people don't just have alcoholic written into their souls.

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,760
It's a little too mechanical and clunky

122
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,320
for a game that really focuses on these personal foibles.

123
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,480
It's also too easy to work around.

124
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,400
It just means you relieve their stress somewhere else,

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
or don't take them to the place where the thing that hurts them more lives.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
It's still very good at creating the feeling of trying to work with people

127
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
with problems and get around them,

128
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,400
but at times it feels a little too mechanistic.

129
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
But even then, that's not all that negative.

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,040
That design decision brings a feeling of its own to the ludonarrative.

131
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,680
Perhaps treating people like they can be easily reduced

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,440
to a short list of good and bad points

133
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,200
is an effect of fighting in a war where people's lives are expendable.

134
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,960
In a sense, it replicates what it must be like to be in a situation like this,

135
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,200
and trying to just keep everyone going.

136
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,760
You start to treat humans a bit less like people,

137
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
and a bit more like statistics.

138
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,160
The game with arguably the best ludonarrative ever,

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,480
besides the otherwise underwhelming Bioshock games,

140
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,360
is Papers, Please, which manages this really well.

141
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a game that teaches you to compromise your own morality

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,360
in favor of following the rules,

143
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
or simply trying to increase your own chances of survival,

144
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
but unlike Darkest Dungeon,

145
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,480
it manages to be messy and human at the same time.

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
This woman's passport has a misprint on it.

147
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,880
She's done nothing wrong, and you can just refuse her entry,

148
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
but you can also have her arrested,

149
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
and the guard who arrests people gets a bonus when you do it,

150
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
and he's offered to share his bonus with you

151
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
if you detain more people,

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,640
which you could use to keep your family warm and fed,

153
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,280
so you do it.

154
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
You let this poor woman get into a whole heap of trouble

155
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
for your own survival.

156
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,600
The next day, the guard tells you his wife was sick,

157
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,280
and he had to spend the money on the medicine

158
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
so he can't share his bonus with you this time.

159
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,200
You detained that woman for nothing.

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,240
I felt genuinely bad when this happened.

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,440
Like, bad on the inside, where my heart should be.

162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
I made that choice.

163
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
I didn't have to, but I did.

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,600
The game avoids merely listing the rules out to you

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
for what money you can get and how,

166
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,680
and throws curveballs where sometimes

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
you don't get what you're told you'd get,

168
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
or a day suddenly gets cut short by a terrorist attack

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
so you don't make much money,

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
and you get stretched a little bit thinner.

171
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
In being willing to compromise its own rule set,

172
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,760
it accurately simulates the feeling of being in turbulent times

173
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,440
where nothing is certain.

174
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,200
Papers, Please is depressing and confusing and wonderful.

175
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
That's not to say that Darkest Dungeon is bad,

176
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,320
or even that I would change anything about it at all,

177
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,280
but I think there's also room for a game like Darkest Dungeon,

178
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
not necessarily an RPG,

179
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,680
where characters' flaws are all a little harder to pin down,

180
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,400
forcing you to detective out each character's deal

181
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
and react to it in ways that feel more natural.

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
If I wasn't already working on a game right now,

183
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,040
I would probably try to make something that incorporates that idea somewhere.

184
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,920
Maybe in the future.

185
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
Thanks very much for watching.

186
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
Uh, please check out—my knee just cracked.

187
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
Thanks very much for watching,

188
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,840
and, uh, please check out my previous video about the—the Braid game,

189
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,400
and at the end you can vote on it, on what the next video is.

190
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,240
You should probably go and do that if you haven't.

191
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,880
Thanks.

192
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Bye!
