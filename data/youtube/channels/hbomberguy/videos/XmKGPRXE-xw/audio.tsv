0	2640	Hi there, would you like to sign my petition?
2640	9840	Colleges and universities are literally teaching teenagers that every white person is a racist.
9840	15840	♪♪
15840	18440	♪♪
18440	22160	Are you still worried about video game feminism?
22160	25480	Has your endless yelling and screaming for years about a lady you don't like
25480	29000	yielded no positive changes and only made the climate more toxic?
29000	34760	Are you starting to feel the darkness closing in as it turns out your ideas make no fucking difference
34760	36840	and the world isn't changing around you?
36840	40280	Well, maybe it's time to demand the academics you hate do it for you!
40280	41720	Sorry, not academics.
41720	43640	U-Universities.
43640	46040	What, like, as a concept?
46040	49320	Dear universities, please stop the bad people for me.
49320	53240	And you know they're bad because I paid someone else to draw propaganda—
53240	59880	Sorry, a realistic and rational cartoon of a woman telling institutions to stop the bad people for her.
59880	62760	And to stop whoever she is, we need you!
62760	64200	U-Universities.
64200	69640	We're calling for the teaching of social justice courses in universities to be temporarily suspended.
69640	71240	What follows is up for debate.
71240	72120	Oh, good.
72120	75800	Once universities have magically stopped all the things he doesn't like,
75800	77720	then we can have a discussion.
77720	80040	Not now. That would require too much effort.
80040	80760	Read the letter.
80760	82680	Ooh, don't mind if I do.
82760	83320	Oh—
83320	86360	(*laughing*)
86360	88760	He couldn't even be bothered.
88760	91400	There isn't even a list of which courses should be dropped.
91400	96440	It's literally just asking universities to please cancel social justice.
96440	102040	We need to stop these feminazi armchair slacktivists with a petition.
102040	103080	Oh, wait.
103080	107640	Okay, so Carl's reasoning might be poor, but luckily he recommends you read the comments on the petition.
107640	110440	And I'm sure that's a really convincing and great idea—
110440	112360	Wait, where's that music coming from?
112360	113720	Oh, no!
113720	115320	OH, NOOOOOO—
115320	120840	I sign because I really think social justice is killing the free speech and the free thought.
120840	122520	This is getting out of control.
122520	126680	At what point do you step in when someone is finally injured?
126680	127640	Finally—
127640	128760	Holy shit.
128760	135240	Expanding a dangerous wave of thought that spreads more racism and sexism than the one it wants to stop.
135240	137560	Switch and regressives need to stop.
137640	144760	Destructing the civilized world as we know it to build a new Orwellian dystopia for to free speech and the free thought.
144760	147640	What is happening in universities is despicable.
147640	151720	People running to safe spaces when they hear different opinions,
151720	155000	believing that the world and everyone in it is out to get them,
155000	158920	preventing anyone with conflicting ideas from organizing events.
158920	160840	The list goes on and on.
160840	167560	I believe the right to free speech matters more to the world than the feelings of so-called oppressed groups.
167560	170600	Ooh, what an edge-stir in Australia there.
170600	174680	I'm tired of being ordered to flagellate myself on the Altair!
174680	176520	I believe in free speech.
177800	182440	Martin Luther King Jr. once stated his dream of a world where his children would be judged
182440	186280	not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
186280	192360	Clearly we've gone from one extreme end to the other, and King is rolling in his grave.
192360	197240	It's cult behavior, teaching original sin on a completely ignorant and new racist way.
197240	204280	Teaching students to be racist to oppose racism is the very sort of backwards logic that has no place in university.
204280	207160	Holy shit, Danielle Dutcher, what?
207160	209640	Salk justice is going too far!
209640	217400	I am signing because I am tired of hearing these stories about Eschew getting on their high horse
217400	220520	and doing horrendous things to everyday people
220520	224840	because they like to generalize and put people into groups!
227720	229240	Holy shit!
229240	234120	Social justice is becoming fascism, and it needs to stop!
234120	238120	I want to get this removed to help everyone I have meet in college!
238120	241240	Biology is sexist. Hashtag end sexual dimorphism.
241240	246360	That's just what little information these social justice teachers have pushed onto our impressionable youth.
246360	253560	Snoop Dogg says I am signing this because social justice is something that needs to be stopped.
253560	259160	If we do not nip social justice in the butt, the USA is screwed.
259160	260520	Oh no.
260520	264920	Oh my god, there's a lot of this. Holy shit, it just keeps going.
264920	267320	I'm a moderate fucking person!
267320	269320	I've never raped!
269320	271320	It's gone too far!
271320	278840	I'm signing because I enrolled in a sociology class but found myself in a leftist indoctrination ritual!
278840	280840	I care about the future!
281720	286520	Wait, half of these comments are complaining about how upset they are at being called racist.
286520	290440	These university courses are doing nothing but coddling these students
290440	298200	into thinking that literally everyone and everything is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and problematic.
298200	302680	And the other half are saying that feminists are the real racists because they're anti-white.
302680	306440	We were forced out of a basket of racist, sexist, and discriminatory ideas.
306440	309720	We were told that whiteness is evil. We were told that men are scum.
309720	313720	These people are evil, misleading, and manipulating racists and sexists
313720	317080	who need to be stopped from indoctrinating other people who are helpless.
317080	322600	Hey, guys, I know you're really mad about what you imagine feminists are like and you want to do something about that,
322600	330280	but maybe first you should get together and figure out if racism is wrong or who the real racists are?
330280	332680	I get kind of mixed messages when one comment says,
332680	335400	they call you racist to try to shut down your ideas,
335400	338440	and the next says, we need to shut down these racists.
338440	339720	Now, I know what you're thinking.
339720	341560	Because I can read your mind.
341560	345400	Isn't petulantly demanding institutions stop teaching things you don't like
345400	350600	literally the sort of thing probably Sargon and his fellow probably freethinkers like to pretend they're against?
350600	352520	As evidenced by this very image?
352520	353560	Actually, you're wrong.
353560	357560	The only way to be anti-censorship is to censor people I say are pro-censorship.
357560	360200	And you can believe me because I have the support of the people.
360200	362120	Oh, no, sorry. These are the fucking EDL.
362120	363720	The actual fucking EDL.
363720	365800	Sorry, I don't know how this footage got in the edit.
365800	366600	How do I stop this?
367400	369240	And Carl's totally trustworthy.
369240	373480	After all, people gave him over 8,000 pounds to make a video game and that's going swimming.
373480	374680	Oh, it was cancelled.
374680	376360	Sorry, I better forget that part.
376360	377560	What a surprise!
377560	381480	One of the de facto leaders of a group that claimed they were about ethics in game journalism
381480	383560	took money to not make a game.
383560	384440	Sorry, guys.
384440	387720	It became too lucrative to be a preacher of reactionary ideology,
387720	390200	so I can't be bothered to keep my promises.
390200	393320	It's taken three months to get to the current build that you can see in the videos.
393320	396760	And we think that Necromancer will be completed by summer 2014.
396760	401480	[♪ NECROMANCER THEME ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
401480	404040	But trying to force institutions to revolve around him
404040	406680	instead of going where the evidence leads isn't a new idea.
406680	409560	Not just to Joseph McCarthy, but to Carl himself.
409560	411560	I think we should start a petition.
411560	412280	Say,
412280	415880	Phenomenism must be classified as a mental illness
415880	419720	because it exhibits all the symptoms.
419720	421720	If enough people sign my petition,
421720	425880	maybe psychology as an institution will start to fit my opinion
425880	427720	like science is supposed to.
427720	429960	This idea that petitions will somehow save the day
429960	432520	has been on Carl's mind for a long time, it seems.
432520	434920	This really is the best he can do, isn't it?
434920	436040	Aww.
436040	437560	Aww, I'm sad now.
437560	440440	But maybe trying to make institutions see things his way
440440	441880	by petitioning them doesn't work
441880	443960	and is actually the opposite of rational?
443960	444760	I don't know.
444760	445560	Maybe.
445560	447800	Even Carl's subscribers agree with me here.
447800	450920	Less than a quarter of them even bothered to sign the petition.
450920	454360	Maybe his subscribers are just too lazy to be armchair activists.
454360	457240	What a rational, productive audience he's cultivated.
457240	459800	The West will be saved from feminism in no time.
460600	462760	They're indoctrinating your children!
462760	464920	They're coming to take your children!
464920	467080	If I write as provocatively as possible,
467080	469400	it becomes a problem worth dealing with, right?
469400	471400	I really missed this popular scare tactic
471400	474120	from when I used to watch 40s propaganda films for fun.
474120	475960	Thanks for bringing it back, Reactionaries.
475960	479640	When fake gay leftist betas aren't sledgehammering the family,
479640	482120	they're busy corrupting your children
482120	484920	using critical theory?
484920	487320	I'll indoctrinate Kevin all I want, Carl.
487320	488520	He deserves it.
488520	490760	I have to scrub his mind clean.
490760	493240	And also, this stock photo was pretty expensive
493240	495320	and I'm gonna get my fucking money's worth.
495320	498600	This ridiculous language cements the rationals right where they belong,
498600	500200	next to other crazies.
500200	503000	Look up indoctrinating your children on YouTube.
503000	504440	You get Sargon's video
504440	507640	and then a bunch of weird Alex Jones nonsense,
507640	509000	chemtrail bullshit,
509000	511400	and classic 60s Red Scare campaign ads.
511640	513400	My nation and our God,
513400	514120	it is...
520120	523240	If we allow this sort of backwards think to continue,
523240	524920	it will eventually result
524920	527560	in the decline of this Western country
527560	528920	into Marxism.
528920	529880	Marxism.
529880	530920	Marxism.
530920	532920	YouTube's algorithms remember what videos
532920	535160	people who watch chemtrail videos also watch.
535160	537560	It understands that if you're dumb enough to like these,
537560	539160	maybe give this guy a try.
539160	541960	His petition will save the world any day now.
541960	543720	It's only been three months.
543720	545640	The revolution is coming.
545640	547800	Eventually, almost a third of his subscribers
547800	549000	will have bothered to sign it.
549000	549960	Close enough.
549960	551800	But why does Carl feel so sure he knows
551800	553160	what the problem is anyway?
553160	554440	There's this thing in psychology,
554440	556040	an institution Carl has yet to insist
556040	557800	is completely taken over by eschews
557800	559560	and corrupting your children,
559560	561640	called the Dunning-Kruger effect.
561640	562680	It's touted quite often,
562680	563880	so you've probably heard of it already,
563880	565560	but it refers to a study that measured
565560	567240	people's perceived skills and abilities
567240	569320	versus their actual skills and abilities.
569320	571240	People who think they already know something in detail
571240	573400	aren't usually looking for more evidence.
573400	575240	Why would you if you think you have all the answers
575240	577160	and are actively presenting solutions?
577160	579960	Solutions which amount to nothing, but still.
579960	581720	It's completely unsurprising that the comments
581720	583720	on the petition appear completely uneducated
583720	584920	as to what's actually happening
584920	586200	on any of these courses,
586200	588120	or why Carl rarely actively talks
588120	589640	about the sort of academic feminism
589640	591000	he's supposedly trying to stop
591000	593080	corrupting our children, Red Scare, Red Scare,
593080	594360	because that would take a level of effort
594360	595640	he's unwilling to invest
595720	598200	since he already thinks he knows what it's all about.
598200	601400	To paraphrase the d-tow-t-d-t-shing,
601400	604200	those who think they know never learn.
604200	605480	He doesn't seem to even try
605480	607400	to debate academic feminists anymore
607400	608840	because, when he tried,
608840	610440	they completely trounced him.
610440	612120	-"I want to know why Barack Obama
612120	615240	is giving the one-in-five college rape myth.
615240	617640	Explain." -"I do. You have to ask Barack Obama."
617640	619240	-"I'm asking you directly
619240	621240	why the president of the United States
621240	625080	is perpetuating a false feminist myth."
625480	627480	-"And I said you would have to ask the president
627480	629240	because I am not a Barack Obama,
629240	631640	and I'm not the one putting out that information.
631640	634360	I can't answer what's happening in Barack Obama's head.
634360	637240	I don't think that it's appropriate or fair
637240	640360	for you to make me or anyone, an individual,
640360	642920	answer for anyone's views except their own.
642920	644360	You asked, why is he doing it,
644360	646600	and you asked, why do these things happen?
646600	649000	And I want to know how you think I can know that."
649000	650840	No, you see, feminism is bad
650840	652360	because a politician's speech
652360	654200	used a provocative falsehood,
654200	656840	something that's never happened before.
656840	658920	I highly recommend you watch this whole debate.
658920	660280	Christy Winter's PhD,
660280	662120	but it's a PhD in a social science,
662120	663640	so she's basically not real,
663640	665160	talks openly about real problems
665160	666680	that exist in America right now
666680	668520	and could and should be dealt with.
668520	670520	-"You go out with some friends for drinks.
670520	672040	In the morning, you wake up
672040	674040	with a foul taste in your mouth
674040	676200	and also realize that you have dried semen
676200	677960	on your lips and face.
677960	679480	When you tell this to your friend,
679480	682360	he informs you that after you passed out last night,
682360	683880	he put his penis in your mouth
683880	685480	and used it to get off.
686200	687800	You were orally penetrated
687800	690840	while unconscious and unable to give consent.
690840	693320	You've just been the victim of a crime, right?
694040	695560	Well, not in Oklahoma."
695560	697240	Carl talks about how upset he is
697240	698760	that some people with dyed hair
698760	700440	say the wrong thing on YouTube.
700440	701640	-"Make the ridiculous claim
701640	703080	that they are being oppressed
703080	705400	because sometimes they have to do something.
705400	706840	Whining, entitled, lazy,
706840	708680	wearing makeup and smiling at the camera
708680	709640	con their way into careers
709640	711400	for which they are underqualified.
711400	712280	Man-hatred.
712280	714520	Then I can nag my way into positions of power,
714520	715800	making media from the comfort
715800	717880	of their warm, dry, plush rooms.
717880	719800	Hashtag, give your money to women."
719800	722200	-"Out-of-date oral penetration laws in Oklahoma
722200	724600	are just hilarious, silly things.
724600	726200	Now let's get serious for a second
726200	729720	and talk about the women who are mean on YouTube."
729720	732120	In an actual debate with a real person,
732120	733880	he still can't escape from talking about
733880	736520	the mysterious straw woman version of feminism
736520	738200	who say the wrong things on the Internet
738200	739240	and need to be stopped
739240	741960	before they stop his free speech somehow.
741960	744600	-"Feminism is Orwell's nightmare come to life,
744600	746280	with a bright smile, rainbow hair,
746280	747640	and a jingle in the background
747640	750200	by people so pathologically entitled
750200	753000	they campaign against other people's human rights."
754600	756520	-"If you noticed in his last two rebuttals,
756520	759480	he stopped actually listing any real sources.
759480	761720	And that's because he's using buzzwords
761720	762920	and contempt
762920	765400	and not evidence-based, grounded arguments."
766040	767240	He starts answering questions
767240	769640	with only the purest of rational discourse.
769640	771160	-"So if you're just looking at data
771160	772120	and you're describing it,
772760	774680	yeah, that's one thing you can do.
774680	776840	But if you want to analyse it and understand it,
776840	778920	theoretically, you need a theoretical framework.
778920	780440	If you want a scientific approach,
780440	781800	then you're going to need theory.
781800	784360	And the theory you're going to use is feminism."
784360	786520	-"No, the theory you're going to use is feminism.
786520	788680	Other people will use different theories
788680	789960	to analyse this data."
789960	791320	-"I don't know, I don't care."
791320	792120	-"Exactly!
792120	792680	Like what?
792680	794120	You don't have a response."
794120	796360	I wonder why people who know anything about the facts
796360	798920	have trouble taking this guy's ideas seriously.
798920	800520	Hmm, I wonder.
800520	802600	Maybe it's because we're the real racists?
802600	803400	I don't know.
803400	805320	In a video reflecting on the debate,
805320	807080	he has a rather apologetic tone.
807080	808360	-"But yeah, no, they're right.
808360	809480	And there were, you know,
809480	810280	some people have pointed out
810280	811480	that it really wasn't, like,
811480	813640	the best showing I could have done at all.
813640	815400	And I should have kept my cool a bit more.
815400	817000	And you're right, I should have done."
817000	819320	Wait, is that just a printout of the Twitter logo?
819880	820840	What the fu—
820840	822920	Wha—I—I don't understand!
822920	825720	It seems he knows he kind of messed it up.
825720	826440	His solution?
827240	828520	-"Um, I shouldn't have...
829400	830600	I shouldn't have got angry about it.
831720	834280	I could probably have handled the debate a bit better as well.
834280	835480	Uh, just the actual debate of it.
835480	837720	I—I—I was a bit nervous about it.
837720	838280	I'm not gonna lie.
838280	840440	It's the first time I've ever done anything like this.
840440	842680	And I think I may have over-prepared somewhat."
843800	844600	Yeah.
844600	845960	Yeah, that's the problem here.
845960	847320	It has nothing to do with this.
848040	849800	-"I mean, it's—it's nice to have lots of support,
849800	852280	but it's even nicer when you've got the people
852280	855480	who are actually leaving thoughtful and, um,
855720	856220	um,
857160	859320	like, incisive comments
859320	860760	that are a critique of what you've done,
860760	862040	an honest critique."
862040	863400	Oh, fucking hell.
863400	866440	Can you not summarize this in under five minutes?
866440	869000	-"Um, even if they feel like the voice in the wilderness,
869000	870440	please don't stop doing that, guys,
870440	873080	because it's more valuable than I can
874040	875880	adequately explain, I think."
875880	879320	I don't have the patience to sit through over half an hour of this.
879320	880440	Carl Benjamin,
880440	883400	the guy who can't watch more than five minutes of a video,
883400	886920	can't watch more than five minutes of the video making fun of that fact,
886920	889480	can't read more than the first page of a study,
889480	892120	and most likely hasn't read more than a sliver of the books
892120	894440	he's trying to get dropped from being taught in academia,
894440	895720	has given it some thought.
895720	898520	And he feels like he does too much research!
898520	899800	Carl doesn't know,
899800	901160	he doesn't care,
901160	903560	and he wants to know and care less.
903560	905560	But he's sure he knows the solution to the problem
905560	908440	he purposefully goes out of his way to avoid understanding.
908440	909880	Sign the petition today,
909880	910680	and be quick,
910680	913320	because if the feminazis criticize me one more time,
913320	916440	even though I'm not actually being stopped from doing anything when they criticize me,
916440	917880	I'm gonna have a panic attack!
917880	919080	I just couldn't handle that!
919640	920360	Wait a second.
920360	923080	Why is minor criticism so scary to you?
923720	924220	No.
924840	925340	No!
925880	926380	No!
943880	944380	You know what?
944380	946600	It's been a while since I've thanked everyone in one video,
946600	947640	so let's do it!
