00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Hi there, would you like to sign my petition?

00:02.640 --> 00:09.840
Colleges and universities are literally teaching teenagers that every white person is a racist.

00:09.840 --> 00:15.840
♪♪

00:15.840 --> 00:18.440
♪♪

00:18.440 --> 00:22.160
Are you still worried about video game feminism?

00:22.160 --> 00:25.480
Has your endless yelling and screaming for years about a lady you don't like

00:25.480 --> 00:29.000
yielded no positive changes and only made the climate more toxic?

00:29.000 --> 00:34.760
Are you starting to feel the darkness closing in as it turns out your ideas make no fucking difference

00:34.760 --> 00:36.840
and the world isn't changing around you?

00:36.840 --> 00:40.280
Well, maybe it's time to demand the academics you hate do it for you!

00:40.280 --> 00:41.720
Sorry, not academics.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.640
U-Universities.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.040
What, like, as a concept?

00:46.040 --> 00:49.320
Dear universities, please stop the bad people for me.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.240
And you know they're bad because I paid someone else to draw propaganda—

00:53.240 --> 00:59.880
Sorry, a realistic and rational cartoon of a woman telling institutions to stop the bad people for her.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.760
And to stop whoever she is, we need you!

01:02.760 --> 01:04.200
U-Universities.

01:04.200 --> 01:09.640
We're calling for the teaching of social justice courses in universities to be temporarily suspended.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.240
What follows is up for debate.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.120
Oh, good.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.800
Once universities have magically stopped all the things he doesn't like,

01:15.800 --> 01:17.720
then we can have a discussion.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.040
Not now. That would require too much effort.

01:20.040 --> 01:20.760
Read the letter.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.680
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.320
Oh—

01:23.320 --> 01:26.360
(*laughing*)

01:26.360 --> 01:28.760
He couldn't even be bothered.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.400
There isn't even a list of which courses should be dropped.

01:31.400 --> 01:36.440
It's literally just asking universities to please cancel social justice.

01:36.440 --> 01:42.040
We need to stop these feminazi armchair slacktivists with a petition.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.080
Oh, wait.

01:43.080 --> 01:47.640
Okay, so Carl's reasoning might be poor, but luckily he recommends you read the comments on the petition.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.440
And I'm sure that's a really convincing and great idea—

01:50.440 --> 01:52.360
Wait, where's that music coming from?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.720
Oh, no!

01:53.720 --> 01:55.320
OH, NOOOOOO—

01:55.320 --> 02:00.840
I sign because I really think social justice is killing the free speech and the free thought.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.520
This is getting out of control.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.680
At what point do you step in when someone is finally injured?

02:06.680 --> 02:07.640
Finally—

02:07.640 --> 02:08.760
Holy shit.

02:08.760 --> 02:15.240
Expanding a dangerous wave of thought that spreads more racism and sexism than the one it wants to stop.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.560
Switch and regressives need to stop.

02:17.640 --> 02:24.760
Destructing the civilized world as we know it to build a new Orwellian dystopia for to free speech and the free thought.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.640
What is happening in universities is despicable.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.720
People running to safe spaces when they hear different opinions,

02:31.720 --> 02:35.000
believing that the world and everyone in it is out to get them,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.920
preventing anyone with conflicting ideas from organizing events.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.840
The list goes on and on.

02:40.840 --> 02:47.560
I believe the right to free speech matters more to the world than the feelings of so-called oppressed groups.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.600
Ooh, what an edge-stir in Australia there.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.680
I'm tired of being ordered to flagellate myself on the Altair!

02:54.680 --> 02:56.520
I believe in free speech.

02:57.800 --> 03:02.440
Martin Luther King Jr. once stated his dream of a world where his children would be judged

03:02.440 --> 03:06.280
not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.

03:06.280 --> 03:12.360
Clearly we've gone from one extreme end to the other, and King is rolling in his grave.

03:12.360 --> 03:17.240
It's cult behavior, teaching original sin on a completely ignorant and new racist way.

03:17.240 --> 03:24.280
Teaching students to be racist to oppose racism is the very sort of backwards logic that has no place in university.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.160
Holy shit, Danielle Dutcher, what?

03:27.160 --> 03:29.640
Salk justice is going too far!

03:29.640 --> 03:37.400
I am signing because I am tired of hearing these stories about Eschew getting on their high horse

03:37.400 --> 03:40.520
and doing horrendous things to everyday people

03:40.520 --> 03:44.840
because they like to generalize and put people into groups!

03:47.720 --> 03:49.240
Holy shit!

03:49.240 --> 03:54.120
Social justice is becoming fascism, and it needs to stop!

03:54.120 --> 03:58.120
I want to get this removed to help everyone I have meet in college!

03:58.120 --> 04:01.240
Biology is sexist. Hashtag end sexual dimorphism.

04:01.240 --> 04:06.360
That's just what little information these social justice teachers have pushed onto our impressionable youth.

04:06.360 --> 04:13.560
Snoop Dogg says I am signing this because social justice is something that needs to be stopped.

04:13.560 --> 04:19.160
If we do not nip social justice in the butt, the USA is screwed.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.520
Oh no.

04:20.520 --> 04:24.920
Oh my god, there's a lot of this. Holy shit, it just keeps going.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.320
I'm a moderate fucking person!

04:27.320 --> 04:29.320
I've never raped!

04:29.320 --> 04:31.320
It's gone too far!

04:31.320 --> 04:38.840
I'm signing because I enrolled in a sociology class but found myself in a leftist indoctrination ritual!

04:38.840 --> 04:40.840
I care about the future!

04:41.720 --> 04:46.520
Wait, half of these comments are complaining about how upset they are at being called racist.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.440
These university courses are doing nothing but coddling these students

04:50.440 --> 04:58.200
into thinking that literally everyone and everything is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and problematic.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.680
And the other half are saying that feminists are the real racists because they're anti-white.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.440
We were forced out of a basket of racist, sexist, and discriminatory ideas.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.720
We were told that whiteness is evil. We were told that men are scum.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.720
These people are evil, misleading, and manipulating racists and sexists

05:13.720 --> 05:17.080
who need to be stopped from indoctrinating other people who are helpless.

05:17.080 --> 05:22.600
Hey, guys, I know you're really mad about what you imagine feminists are like and you want to do something about that,

05:22.600 --> 05:30.280
but maybe first you should get together and figure out if racism is wrong or who the real racists are?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.680
I get kind of mixed messages when one comment says,

05:32.680 --> 05:35.400
they call you racist to try to shut down your ideas,

05:35.400 --> 05:38.440
and the next says, we need to shut down these racists.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.720
Now, I know what you're thinking.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.560
Because I can read your mind.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.400
Isn't petulantly demanding institutions stop teaching things you don't like

05:45.400 --> 05:50.600
literally the sort of thing probably Sargon and his fellow probably freethinkers like to pretend they're against?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.520
As evidenced by this very image?

05:52.520 --> 05:53.560
Actually, you're wrong.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.560
The only way to be anti-censorship is to censor people I say are pro-censorship.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.200
And you can believe me because I have the support of the people.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.120
Oh, no, sorry. These are the fucking EDL.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.720
The actual fucking EDL.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.800
Sorry, I don't know how this footage got in the edit.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.600
How do I stop this?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.240
And Carl's totally trustworthy.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.480
After all, people gave him over 8,000 pounds to make a video game and that's going swimming.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.680
Oh, it was cancelled.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.360
Sorry, I better forget that part.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.560
What a surprise!

06:17.560 --> 06:21.480
One of the de facto leaders of a group that claimed they were about ethics in game journalism

06:21.480 --> 06:23.560
took money to not make a game.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.440
Sorry, guys.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.720
It became too lucrative to be a preacher of reactionary ideology,

06:27.720 --> 06:30.200
so I can't be bothered to keep my promises.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.320
It's taken three months to get to the current build that you can see in the videos.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.760
And we think that Necromancer will be completed by summer 2014.

06:36.760 --> 06:41.480
[♪ NECROMANCER THEME ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

06:41.480 --> 06:44.040
But trying to force institutions to revolve around him

06:44.040 --> 06:46.680
instead of going where the evidence leads isn't a new idea.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.560
Not just to Joseph McCarthy, but to Carl himself.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.560
I think we should start a petition.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.280
Say,

06:52.280 --> 06:55.880
Phenomenism must be classified as a mental illness

06:55.880 --> 06:59.720
because it exhibits all the symptoms.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.720
If enough people sign my petition,

07:01.720 --> 07:05.880
maybe psychology as an institution will start to fit my opinion

07:05.880 --> 07:07.720
like science is supposed to.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.960
This idea that petitions will somehow save the day

07:09.960 --> 07:12.520
has been on Carl's mind for a long time, it seems.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.920
This really is the best he can do, isn't it?

07:14.920 --> 07:16.040
Aww.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.560
Aww, I'm sad now.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.440
But maybe trying to make institutions see things his way

07:20.440 --> 07:21.880
by petitioning them doesn't work

07:21.880 --> 07:23.960
and is actually the opposite of rational?

07:23.960 --> 07:24.760
I don't know.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.560
Maybe.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.800
Even Carl's subscribers agree with me here.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.920
Less than a quarter of them even bothered to sign the petition.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.360
Maybe his subscribers are just too lazy to be armchair activists.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.240
What a rational, productive audience he's cultivated.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.800
The West will be saved from feminism in no time.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.760
They're indoctrinating your children!

07:42.760 --> 07:44.920
They're coming to take your children!

07:44.920 --> 07:47.080
If I write as provocatively as possible,

07:47.080 --> 07:49.400
it becomes a problem worth dealing with, right?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.400
I really missed this popular scare tactic

07:51.400 --> 07:54.120
from when I used to watch 40s propaganda films for fun.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.960
Thanks for bringing it back, Reactionaries.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.640
When fake gay leftist betas aren't sledgehammering the family,

07:59.640 --> 08:02.120
they're busy corrupting your children

08:02.120 --> 08:04.920
using critical theory?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.320
I'll indoctrinate Kevin all I want, Carl.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.520
He deserves it.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.760
I have to scrub his mind clean.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.240
And also, this stock photo was pretty expensive

08:13.240 --> 08:15.320
and I'm gonna get my fucking money's worth.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.600
This ridiculous language cements the rationals right where they belong,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.200
next to other crazies.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.000
Look up indoctrinating your children on YouTube.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.440
You get Sargon's video

08:24.440 --> 08:27.640
and then a bunch of weird Alex Jones nonsense,

08:27.640 --> 08:29.000
chemtrail bullshit,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.400
and classic 60s Red Scare campaign ads.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.400
My nation and our God,

08:33.400 --> 08:34.120
it is...

08:40.120 --> 08:43.240
If we allow this sort of backwards think to continue,

08:43.240 --> 08:44.920
it will eventually result

08:44.920 --> 08:47.560
in the decline of this Western country

08:47.560 --> 08:48.920
into Marxism.

08:48.920 --> 08:49.880
Marxism.

08:49.880 --> 08:50.920
Marxism.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.920
YouTube's algorithms remember what videos

08:52.920 --> 08:55.160
people who watch chemtrail videos also watch.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.560
It understands that if you're dumb enough to like these,

08:57.560 --> 08:59.160
maybe give this guy a try.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.960
His petition will save the world any day now.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.720
It's only been three months.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.640
The revolution is coming.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.800
Eventually, almost a third of his subscribers

09:07.800 --> 09:09.000
will have bothered to sign it.

09:09.000 --> 09:09.960
Close enough.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.800
But why does Carl feel so sure he knows

09:11.800 --> 09:13.160
what the problem is anyway?

09:13.160 --> 09:14.440
There's this thing in psychology,

09:14.440 --> 09:16.040
an institution Carl has yet to insist

09:16.040 --> 09:17.800
is completely taken over by eschews

09:17.800 --> 09:19.560
and corrupting your children,

09:19.560 --> 09:21.640
called the Dunning-Kruger effect.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.680
It's touted quite often,

09:22.680 --> 09:23.880
so you've probably heard of it already,

09:23.880 --> 09:25.560
but it refers to a study that measured

09:25.560 --> 09:27.240
people's perceived skills and abilities

09:27.240 --> 09:29.320
versus their actual skills and abilities.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.240
People who think they already know something in detail

09:31.240 --> 09:33.400
aren't usually looking for more evidence.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.240
Why would you if you think you have all the answers

09:35.240 --> 09:37.160
and are actively presenting solutions?

09:37.160 --> 09:39.960
Solutions which amount to nothing, but still.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.720
It's completely unsurprising that the comments

09:41.720 --> 09:43.720
on the petition appear completely uneducated

09:43.720 --> 09:44.920
as to what's actually happening

09:44.920 --> 09:46.200
on any of these courses,

09:46.200 --> 09:48.120
or why Carl rarely actively talks

09:48.120 --> 09:49.640
about the sort of academic feminism

09:49.640 --> 09:51.000
he's supposedly trying to stop

09:51.000 --> 09:53.080
corrupting our children, Red Scare, Red Scare,

09:53.080 --> 09:54.360
because that would take a level of effort

09:54.360 --> 09:55.640
he's unwilling to invest

09:55.720 --> 09:58.200
since he already thinks he knows what it's all about.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.400
To paraphrase the d-tow-t-d-t-shing,

10:01.400 --> 10:04.200
those who think they know never learn.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.480
He doesn't seem to even try

10:05.480 --> 10:07.400
to debate academic feminists anymore

10:07.400 --> 10:08.840
because, when he tried,

10:08.840 --> 10:10.440
they completely trounced him.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.120
-"I want to know why Barack Obama

10:12.120 --> 10:15.240
is giving the one-in-five college rape myth.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.640
Explain." -"I do. You have to ask Barack Obama."

10:17.640 --> 10:19.240
-"I'm asking you directly

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
why the president of the United States

10:21.240 --> 10:25.080
is perpetuating a false feminist myth."

10:25.480 --> 10:27.480
-"And I said you would have to ask the president

10:27.480 --> 10:29.240
because I am not a Barack Obama,

10:29.240 --> 10:31.640
and I'm not the one putting out that information.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.360
I can't answer what's happening in Barack Obama's head.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.240
I don't think that it's appropriate or fair

10:37.240 --> 10:40.360
for you to make me or anyone, an individual,

10:40.360 --> 10:42.920
answer for anyone's views except their own.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.360
You asked, why is he doing it,

10:44.360 --> 10:46.600
and you asked, why do these things happen?

10:46.600 --> 10:49.000
And I want to know how you think I can know that."

10:49.000 --> 10:50.840
No, you see, feminism is bad

10:50.840 --> 10:52.360
because a politician's speech

10:52.360 --> 10:54.200
used a provocative falsehood,

10:54.200 --> 10:56.840
something that's never happened before.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.920
I highly recommend you watch this whole debate.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.280
Christy Winter's PhD,

11:00.280 --> 11:02.120
but it's a PhD in a social science,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.640
so she's basically not real,

11:03.640 --> 11:05.160
talks openly about real problems

11:05.160 --> 11:06.680
that exist in America right now

11:06.680 --> 11:08.520
and could and should be dealt with.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.520
-"You go out with some friends for drinks.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.040
In the morning, you wake up

11:12.040 --> 11:14.040
with a foul taste in your mouth

11:14.040 --> 11:16.200
and also realize that you have dried semen

11:16.200 --> 11:17.960
on your lips and face.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.480
When you tell this to your friend,

11:19.480 --> 11:22.360
he informs you that after you passed out last night,

11:22.360 --> 11:23.880
he put his penis in your mouth

11:23.880 --> 11:25.480
and used it to get off.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.800
You were orally penetrated

11:27.800 --> 11:30.840
while unconscious and unable to give consent.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.320
You've just been the victim of a crime, right?

11:34.040 --> 11:35.560
Well, not in Oklahoma."

11:35.560 --> 11:37.240
Carl talks about how upset he is

11:37.240 --> 11:38.760
that some people with dyed hair

11:38.760 --> 11:40.440
say the wrong thing on YouTube.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.640
-"Make the ridiculous claim

11:41.640 --> 11:43.080
that they are being oppressed

11:43.080 --> 11:45.400
because sometimes they have to do something.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.840
Whining, entitled, lazy,

11:46.840 --> 11:48.680
wearing makeup and smiling at the camera

11:48.680 --> 11:49.640
con their way into careers

11:49.640 --> 11:51.400
for which they are underqualified.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.280
Man-hatred.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.520
Then I can nag my way into positions of power,

11:54.520 --> 11:55.800
making media from the comfort

11:55.800 --> 11:57.880
of their warm, dry, plush rooms.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.800
Hashtag, give your money to women."

11:59.800 --> 12:02.200
-"Out-of-date oral penetration laws in Oklahoma

12:02.200 --> 12:04.600
are just hilarious, silly things.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.200
Now let's get serious for a second

12:06.200 --> 12:09.720
and talk about the women who are mean on YouTube."

12:09.720 --> 12:12.120
In an actual debate with a real person,

12:12.120 --> 12:13.880
he still can't escape from talking about

12:13.880 --> 12:16.520
the mysterious straw woman version of feminism

12:16.520 --> 12:18.200
who say the wrong things on the Internet

12:18.200 --> 12:19.240
and need to be stopped

12:19.240 --> 12:21.960
before they stop his free speech somehow.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.600
-"Feminism is Orwell's nightmare come to life,

12:24.600 --> 12:26.280
with a bright smile, rainbow hair,

12:26.280 --> 12:27.640
and a jingle in the background

12:27.640 --> 12:30.200
by people so pathologically entitled

12:30.200 --> 12:33.000
they campaign against other people's human rights."

12:34.600 --> 12:36.520
-"If you noticed in his last two rebuttals,

12:36.520 --> 12:39.480
he stopped actually listing any real sources.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.720
And that's because he's using buzzwords

12:41.720 --> 12:42.920
and contempt

12:42.920 --> 12:45.400
and not evidence-based, grounded arguments."

12:46.040 --> 12:47.240
He starts answering questions

12:47.240 --> 12:49.640
with only the purest of rational discourse.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.160
-"So if you're just looking at data

12:51.160 --> 12:52.120
and you're describing it,

12:52.760 --> 12:54.680
yeah, that's one thing you can do.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.840
But if you want to analyse it and understand it,

12:56.840 --> 12:58.920
theoretically, you need a theoretical framework.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.440
If you want a scientific approach,

13:00.440 --> 13:01.800
then you're going to need theory.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.360
And the theory you're going to use is feminism."

13:04.360 --> 13:06.520
-"No, the theory you're going to use is feminism.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.680
Other people will use different theories

13:08.680 --> 13:09.960
to analyse this data."

13:09.960 --> 13:11.320
-"I don't know, I don't care."

13:11.320 --> 13:12.120
-"Exactly!

13:12.120 --> 13:12.680
Like what?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.120
You don't have a response."

13:14.120 --> 13:16.360
I wonder why people who know anything about the facts

13:16.360 --> 13:18.920
have trouble taking this guy's ideas seriously.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.520
Hmm, I wonder.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.600
Maybe it's because we're the real racists?

13:22.600 --> 13:23.400
I don't know.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.320
In a video reflecting on the debate,

13:25.320 --> 13:27.080
he has a rather apologetic tone.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.360
-"But yeah, no, they're right.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.480
And there were, you know,

13:29.480 --> 13:30.280
some people have pointed out

13:30.280 --> 13:31.480
that it really wasn't, like,

13:31.480 --> 13:33.640
the best showing I could have done at all.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.400
And I should have kept my cool a bit more.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.000
And you're right, I should have done."

13:37.000 --> 13:39.320
Wait, is that just a printout of the Twitter logo?

13:39.880 --> 13:40.840
What the fu—

13:40.840 --> 13:42.920
Wha—I—I don't understand!

13:42.920 --> 13:45.720
It seems he knows he kind of messed it up.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.440
His solution?

13:47.240 --> 13:48.520
-"Um, I shouldn't have...

13:49.400 --> 13:50.600
I shouldn't have got angry about it.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.280
I could probably have handled the debate a bit better as well.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.480
Uh, just the actual debate of it.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.720
I—I—I was a bit nervous about it.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.280
I'm not gonna lie.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.440
It's the first time I've ever done anything like this.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.680
And I think I may have over-prepared somewhat."

14:03.800 --> 14:04.600
Yeah.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.960
Yeah, that's the problem here.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.320
It has nothing to do with this.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.800
-"I mean, it's—it's nice to have lots of support,

14:09.800 --> 14:12.280
but it's even nicer when you've got the people

14:12.280 --> 14:15.480
who are actually leaving thoughtful and, um,

14:15.720 --> 14:16.220
um,

14:17.160 --> 14:19.320
like, incisive comments

14:19.320 --> 14:20.760
that are a critique of what you've done,

14:20.760 --> 14:22.040
an honest critique."

14:22.040 --> 14:23.400
Oh, fucking hell.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.440
Can you not summarize this in under five minutes?

14:26.440 --> 14:29.000
-"Um, even if they feel like the voice in the wilderness,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.440
please don't stop doing that, guys,

14:30.440 --> 14:33.080
because it's more valuable than I can

14:34.040 --> 14:35.880
adequately explain, I think."

14:35.880 --> 14:39.320
I don't have the patience to sit through over half an hour of this.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.440
Carl Benjamin,

14:40.440 --> 14:43.400
the guy who can't watch more than five minutes of a video,

14:43.400 --> 14:46.920
can't watch more than five minutes of the video making fun of that fact,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.480
can't read more than the first page of a study,

14:49.480 --> 14:52.120
and most likely hasn't read more than a sliver of the books

14:52.120 --> 14:54.440
he's trying to get dropped from being taught in academia,

14:54.440 --> 14:55.720
has given it some thought.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.520
And he feels like he does too much research!

14:58.520 --> 14:59.800
Carl doesn't know,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.160
he doesn't care,

15:01.160 --> 15:03.560
and he wants to know and care less.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.560
But he's sure he knows the solution to the problem

15:05.560 --> 15:08.440
he purposefully goes out of his way to avoid understanding.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.880
Sign the petition today,

15:09.880 --> 15:10.680
and be quick,

15:10.680 --> 15:13.320
because if the feminazis criticize me one more time,

15:13.320 --> 15:16.440
even though I'm not actually being stopped from doing anything when they criticize me,

15:16.440 --> 15:17.880
I'm gonna have a panic attack!

15:17.880 --> 15:19.080
I just couldn't handle that!

15:19.640 --> 15:20.360
Wait a second.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.080
Why is minor criticism so scary to you?

15:23.720 --> 15:24.220
No.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.340
No!

15:25.880 --> 15:26.380
No!

15:43.880 --> 15:44.380
You know what?

15:44.380 --> 15:46.600
It's been a while since I've thanked everyone in one video,

15:46.600 --> 15:47.640
so let's do it!

15:47.640 --> 15:48.680
