00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi there, would you like to sign my petition?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,840
Colleges and universities are literally teaching teenagers that every white person is a racist.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,840
♪♪

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,440
♪♪

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,160
Are you still worried about video game feminism?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,480
Has your endless yelling and screaming for years about a lady you don't like

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,000
yielded no positive changes and only made the climate more toxic?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,760
Are you starting to feel the darkness closing in as it turns out your ideas make no fucking difference

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,840
and the world isn't changing around you?

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,280
Well, maybe it's time to demand the academics you hate do it for you!

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,720
Sorry, not academics.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,640
U-Universities.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,040
What, like, as a concept?

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,320
Dear universities, please stop the bad people for me.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,240
And you know they're bad because I paid someone else to draw propaganda—

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,880
Sorry, a realistic and rational cartoon of a woman telling institutions to stop the bad people for her.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,760
And to stop whoever she is, we need you!

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,200
U-Universities.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,640
We're calling for the teaching of social justice courses in universities to be temporarily suspended.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,240
What follows is up for debate.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,120
Oh, good.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,800
Once universities have magically stopped all the things he doesn't like,

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,720
then we can have a discussion.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,040
Not now. That would require too much effort.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,760
Read the letter.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,680
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,320
Oh—

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,360
(*laughing*)

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,760
He couldn't even be bothered.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,400
There isn't even a list of which courses should be dropped.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,440
It's literally just asking universities to please cancel social justice.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,040
We need to stop these feminazi armchair slacktivists with a petition.

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,080
Oh, wait.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,640
Okay, so Carl's reasoning might be poor, but luckily he recommends you read the comments on the petition.

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,440
And I'm sure that's a really convincing and great idea—

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,360
Wait, where's that music coming from?

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,720
Oh, no!

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
OH, NOOOOOO—

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,840
I sign because I really think social justice is killing the free speech and the free thought.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
This is getting out of control.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,680
At what point do you step in when someone is finally injured?

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,640
Finally—

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,760
Holy shit.

44
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,240
Expanding a dangerous wave of thought that spreads more racism and sexism than the one it wants to stop.

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,560
Switch and regressives need to stop.

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,760
Destructing the civilized world as we know it to build a new Orwellian dystopia for to free speech and the free thought.

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,640
What is happening in universities is despicable.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,720
People running to safe spaces when they hear different opinions,

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,000
believing that the world and everyone in it is out to get them,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,920
preventing anyone with conflicting ideas from organizing events.

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,840
The list goes on and on.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,560
I believe the right to free speech matters more to the world than the feelings of so-called oppressed groups.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,600
Ooh, what an edge-stir in Australia there.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm tired of being ordered to flagellate myself on the Altair!

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,520
I believe in free speech.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,440
Martin Luther King Jr. once stated his dream of a world where his children would be judged

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,280
not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,360
Clearly we've gone from one extreme end to the other, and King is rolling in his grave.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,240
It's cult behavior, teaching original sin on a completely ignorant and new racist way.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Teaching students to be racist to oppose racism is the very sort of backwards logic that has no place in university.

61
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,160
Holy shit, Danielle Dutcher, what?

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,640
Salk justice is going too far!

63
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:37,400
I am signing because I am tired of hearing these stories about Eschew getting on their high horse

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,520
and doing horrendous things to everyday people

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,840
because they like to generalize and put people into groups!

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,240
Holy shit!

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,120
Social justice is becoming fascism, and it needs to stop!

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,120
I want to get this removed to help everyone I have meet in college!

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,240
Biology is sexist. Hashtag end sexual dimorphism.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,360
That's just what little information these social justice teachers have pushed onto our impressionable youth.

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,560
Snoop Dogg says I am signing this because social justice is something that needs to be stopped.

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,160
If we do not nip social justice in the butt, the USA is screwed.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,520
Oh no.

74
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,920
Oh my god, there's a lot of this. Holy shit, it just keeps going.

75
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,320
I'm a moderate fucking person!

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I've never raped!

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
It's gone too far!

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm signing because I enrolled in a sociology class but found myself in a leftist indoctrination ritual!

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
I care about the future!

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Wait, half of these comments are complaining about how upset they are at being called racist.

81
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,440
These university courses are doing nothing but coddling these students

82
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:58,200
into thinking that literally everyone and everything is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and problematic.

83
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,680
And the other half are saying that feminists are the real racists because they're anti-white.

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,440
We were forced out of a basket of racist, sexist, and discriminatory ideas.

85
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,720
We were told that whiteness is evil. We were told that men are scum.

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,720
These people are evil, misleading, and manipulating racists and sexists

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,080
who need to be stopped from indoctrinating other people who are helpless.

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,600
Hey, guys, I know you're really mad about what you imagine feminists are like and you want to do something about that,

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,280
but maybe first you should get together and figure out if racism is wrong or who the real racists are?

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,680
I get kind of mixed messages when one comment says,

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,400
they call you racist to try to shut down your ideas,

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,440
and the next says, we need to shut down these racists.

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Now, I know what you're thinking.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Because I can read your mind.

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,400
Isn't petulantly demanding institutions stop teaching things you don't like

96
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,600
literally the sort of thing probably Sargon and his fellow probably freethinkers like to pretend they're against?

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
As evidenced by this very image?

98
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
Actually, you're wrong.

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,560
The only way to be anti-censorship is to censor people I say are pro-censorship.

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,200
And you can believe me because I have the support of the people.

101
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,120
Oh, no, sorry. These are the fucking EDL.

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
The actual fucking EDL.

103
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,800
Sorry, I don't know how this footage got in the edit.

104
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
How do I stop this?

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,240
And Carl's totally trustworthy.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,480
After all, people gave him over 8,000 pounds to make a video game and that's going swimming.

107
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
Oh, it was cancelled.

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,360
Sorry, I better forget that part.

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,560
What a surprise!

110
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,480
One of the de facto leaders of a group that claimed they were about ethics in game journalism

111
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,560
took money to not make a game.

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
Sorry, guys.

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,720
It became too lucrative to be a preacher of reactionary ideology,

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,200
so I can't be bothered to keep my promises.

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,320
It's taken three months to get to the current build that you can see in the videos.

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,760
And we think that Necromancer will be completed by summer 2014.

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,480
[♪ NECROMANCER THEME ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,040
But trying to force institutions to revolve around him

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,680
instead of going where the evidence leads isn't a new idea.

120
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Not just to Joseph McCarthy, but to Carl himself.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I think we should start a petition.

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,280
Say,

123
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,880
Phenomenism must be classified as a mental illness

124
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,720
because it exhibits all the symptoms.

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
If enough people sign my petition,

126
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,880
maybe psychology as an institution will start to fit my opinion

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
like science is supposed to.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,960
This idea that petitions will somehow save the day

129
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,520
has been on Carl's mind for a long time, it seems.

130
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,920
This really is the best he can do, isn't it?

131
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,040
Aww.

132
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,560
Aww, I'm sad now.

133
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,440
But maybe trying to make institutions see things his way

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,880
by petitioning them doesn't work

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,960
and is actually the opposite of rational?

136
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,760
I don't know.

137
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,560
Maybe.

138
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,800
Even Carl's subscribers agree with me here.

139
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,920
Less than a quarter of them even bothered to sign the petition.

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,360
Maybe his subscribers are just too lazy to be armchair activists.

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,240
What a rational, productive audience he's cultivated.

142
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,800
The West will be saved from feminism in no time.

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,760
They're indoctrinating your children!

144
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,920
They're coming to take your children!

145
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,080
If I write as provocatively as possible,

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,400
it becomes a problem worth dealing with, right?

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I really missed this popular scare tactic

148
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,120
from when I used to watch 40s propaganda films for fun.

149
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,960
Thanks for bringing it back, Reactionaries.

150
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,640
When fake gay leftist betas aren't sledgehammering the family,

151
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,120
they're busy corrupting your children

152
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,920
using critical theory?

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll indoctrinate Kevin all I want, Carl.

154
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,520
He deserves it.

155
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,760
I have to scrub his mind clean.

156
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,240
And also, this stock photo was pretty expensive

157
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,320
and I'm gonna get my fucking money's worth.

158
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,600
This ridiculous language cements the rationals right where they belong,

159
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
next to other crazies.

160
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Look up indoctrinating your children on YouTube.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,440
You get Sargon's video

162
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,640
and then a bunch of weird Alex Jones nonsense,

163
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
chemtrail bullshit,

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,400
and classic 60s Red Scare campaign ads.

165
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,400
My nation and our God,

166
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,120
it is...

167
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,240
If we allow this sort of backwards think to continue,

168
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,920
it will eventually result

169
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,560
in the decline of this Western country

170
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,920
into Marxism.

171
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,880
Marxism.

172
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,920
Marxism.

173
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
YouTube's algorithms remember what videos

174
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,160
people who watch chemtrail videos also watch.

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,560
It understands that if you're dumb enough to like these,

176
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,160
maybe give this guy a try.

177
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,960
His petition will save the world any day now.

178
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,720
It's only been three months.

179
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,640
The revolution is coming.

180
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,800
Eventually, almost a third of his subscribers

181
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
will have bothered to sign it.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
Close enough.

183
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,800
But why does Carl feel so sure he knows

184
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
what the problem is anyway?

185
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
There's this thing in psychology,

186
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
an institution Carl has yet to insist

187
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,800
is completely taken over by eschews

188
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,560
and corrupting your children,

189
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,640
called the Dunning-Kruger effect.

190
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,680
It's touted quite often,

191
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,880
so you've probably heard of it already,

192
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
but it refers to a study that measured

193
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
people's perceived skills and abilities

194
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,320
versus their actual skills and abilities.

195
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,240
People who think they already know something in detail

196
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,400
aren't usually looking for more evidence.

197
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,240
Why would you if you think you have all the answers

198
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,160
and are actively presenting solutions?

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,960
Solutions which amount to nothing, but still.

200
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,720
It's completely unsurprising that the comments

201
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
on the petition appear completely uneducated

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,920
as to what's actually happening

203
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,200
on any of these courses,

204
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,120
or why Carl rarely actively talks

205
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,640
about the sort of academic feminism

206
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,000
he's supposedly trying to stop

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,080
corrupting our children, Red Scare, Red Scare,

208
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
because that would take a level of effort

209
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,640
he's unwilling to invest

210
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,200
since he already thinks he knows what it's all about.

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,400
To paraphrase the d-tow-t-d-t-shing,

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,200
those who think they know never learn.

213
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
He doesn't seem to even try

214
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
to debate academic feminists anymore

215
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,840
because, when he tried,

216
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,440
they completely trounced him.

217
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,120
-"I want to know why Barack Obama

218
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,240
is giving the one-in-five college rape myth.

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,640
Explain." -"I do. You have to ask Barack Obama."

220
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
-"I'm asking you directly

221
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
why the president of the United States

222
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,080
is perpetuating a false feminist myth."

223
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
-"And I said you would have to ask the president

224
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,240
because I am not a Barack Obama,

225
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,640
and I'm not the one putting out that information.

226
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,360
I can't answer what's happening in Barack Obama's head.

227
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,240
I don't think that it's appropriate or fair

228
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,360
for you to make me or anyone, an individual,

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,920
answer for anyone's views except their own.

230
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,360
You asked, why is he doing it,

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,600
and you asked, why do these things happen?

232
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,000
And I want to know how you think I can know that."

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,840
No, you see, feminism is bad

234
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,360
because a politician's speech

235
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,200
used a provocative falsehood,

236
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,840
something that's never happened before.

237
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,920
I highly recommend you watch this whole debate.

238
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,280
Christy Winter's PhD,

239
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,120
but it's a PhD in a social science,

240
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,640
so she's basically not real,

241
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,160
talks openly about real problems

242
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,680
that exist in America right now

243
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,520
and could and should be dealt with.

244
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
-"You go out with some friends for drinks.

245
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,040
In the morning, you wake up

246
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
with a foul taste in your mouth

247
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
and also realize that you have dried semen

248
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,960
on your lips and face.

249
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,480
When you tell this to your friend,

250
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,360
he informs you that after you passed out last night,

251
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,880
he put his penis in your mouth

252
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
and used it to get off.

253
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
You were orally penetrated

254
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,840
while unconscious and unable to give consent.

255
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,320
You've just been the victim of a crime, right?

256
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,560
Well, not in Oklahoma."

257
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,240
Carl talks about how upset he is

258
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,760
that some people with dyed hair

259
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,440
say the wrong thing on YouTube.

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,640
-"Make the ridiculous claim

261
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,080
that they are being oppressed

262
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,400
because sometimes they have to do something.

263
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,840
Whining, entitled, lazy,

264
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,680
wearing makeup and smiling at the camera

265
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,640
con their way into careers

266
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
for which they are underqualified.

267
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,280
Man-hatred.

268
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,520
Then I can nag my way into positions of power,

269
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
making media from the comfort

270
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,880
of their warm, dry, plush rooms.

271
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,800
Hashtag, give your money to women."

272
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,200
-"Out-of-date oral penetration laws in Oklahoma

273
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
are just hilarious, silly things.

274
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Now let's get serious for a second

275
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,720
and talk about the women who are mean on YouTube."

276
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,120
In an actual debate with a real person,

277
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,880
he still can't escape from talking about

278
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,520
the mysterious straw woman version of feminism

279
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,200
who say the wrong things on the Internet

280
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,240
and need to be stopped

281
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,960
before they stop his free speech somehow.

282
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,600
-"Feminism is Orwell's nightmare come to life,

283
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,280
with a bright smile, rainbow hair,

284
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
and a jingle in the background

285
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,200
by people so pathologically entitled

286
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,000
they campaign against other people's human rights."

287
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,520
-"If you noticed in his last two rebuttals,

288
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,480
he stopped actually listing any real sources.

289
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,720
And that's because he's using buzzwords

290
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,920
and contempt

291
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,400
and not evidence-based, grounded arguments."

292
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,240
He starts answering questions

293
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,640
with only the purest of rational discourse.

294
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,160
-"So if you're just looking at data

295
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,120
and you're describing it,

296
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,680
yeah, that's one thing you can do.

297
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,840
But if you want to analyse it and understand it,

298
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,920
theoretically, you need a theoretical framework.

299
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,440
If you want a scientific approach,

300
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,800
then you're going to need theory.

301
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,360
And the theory you're going to use is feminism."

302
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,520
-"No, the theory you're going to use is feminism.

303
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,680
Other people will use different theories

304
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,960
to analyse this data."

305
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,320
-"I don't know, I don't care."

306
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,120
-"Exactly!

307
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,680
Like what?

308
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,120
You don't have a response."

309
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,360
I wonder why people who know anything about the facts

310
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,920
have trouble taking this guy's ideas seriously.

311
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Hmm, I wonder.

312
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,600
Maybe it's because we're the real racists?

313
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,400
I don't know.

314
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,320
In a video reflecting on the debate,

315
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
he has a rather apologetic tone.

316
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,360
-"But yeah, no, they're right.

317
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
And there were, you know,

318
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,280
some people have pointed out

319
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,480
that it really wasn't, like,

320
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,640
the best showing I could have done at all.

321
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,400
And I should have kept my cool a bit more.

322
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
And you're right, I should have done."

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,320
Wait, is that just a printout of the Twitter logo?

324
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
What the fu—

325
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,920
Wha—I—I don't understand!

326
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,720
It seems he knows he kind of messed it up.

327
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,440
His solution?

328
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,520
-"Um, I shouldn't have...

329
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,600
I shouldn't have got angry about it.

330
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,280
I could probably have handled the debate a bit better as well.

331
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,480
Uh, just the actual debate of it.

332
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,720
I—I—I was a bit nervous about it.

333
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm not gonna lie.

334
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,440
It's the first time I've ever done anything like this.

335
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,680
And I think I may have over-prepared somewhat."

336
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,600
Yeah.

337
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,960
Yeah, that's the problem here.

338
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
It has nothing to do with this.

339
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
-"I mean, it's—it's nice to have lots of support,

340
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,280
but it's even nicer when you've got the people

341
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,480
who are actually leaving thoughtful and, um,

342
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,220
um,

343
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
like, incisive comments

344
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,760
that are a critique of what you've done,

345
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,040
an honest critique."

346
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, fucking hell.

347
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,440
Can you not summarize this in under five minutes?

348
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,000
-"Um, even if they feel like the voice in the wilderness,

349
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,440
please don't stop doing that, guys,

350
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,080
because it's more valuable than I can

351
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,880
adequately explain, I think."

352
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,320
I don't have the patience to sit through over half an hour of this.

353
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,440
Carl Benjamin,

354
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,400
the guy who can't watch more than five minutes of a video,

355
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,920
can't watch more than five minutes of the video making fun of that fact,

356
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,480
can't read more than the first page of a study,

357
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,120
and most likely hasn't read more than a sliver of the books

358
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,440
he's trying to get dropped from being taught in academia,

359
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
has given it some thought.

360
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,520
And he feels like he does too much research!

361
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,800
Carl doesn't know,

362
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,160
he doesn't care,

363
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,560
and he wants to know and care less.

364
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
But he's sure he knows the solution to the problem

365
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,440
he purposefully goes out of his way to avoid understanding.

366
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,880
Sign the petition today,

367
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,680
and be quick,

368
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,320
because if the feminazis criticize me one more time,

369
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,440
even though I'm not actually being stopped from doing anything when they criticize me,

370
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,880
I'm gonna have a panic attack!

371
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,080
I just couldn't handle that!

372
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Wait a second.

373
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,080
Why is minor criticism so scary to you?

374
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,220
No.

375
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,340
No!

376
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,380
No!

377
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,380
You know what?

378
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,600
It's been a while since I've thanked everyone in one video,

379
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,640
so let's do it!

380
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,680
Special thanks to

381
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,040
