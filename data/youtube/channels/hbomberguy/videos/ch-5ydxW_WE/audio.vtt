00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
If you watch any big movie trailer released in the last 150 years, as long as it's not a romantic comedy,

00:08.400 --> 00:14.540
you can almost guarantee at some point the trailer devolves into a cacophony of motion, noise, explosions, and fights.

00:14.540 --> 00:19.840
Action inherently tells a story. It's confusing, scary, visceral. Something is happening.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.340
It demands your attention to try to find out what's going on and why.

00:23.340 --> 00:26.160
These trailers continue to get made because they work.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.020
If even one of these quick visuals catches your eye,

00:29.020 --> 00:35.360
if one of those six frames of a lightsaber with a cross guard made of more lightsaber really catch your fancy,

00:35.360 --> 00:37.460
that, my friends, is a ticket sale.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.820
Hello, Pirate Bay? Two tickets to StarWars7.mp4, please.

00:42.860 --> 00:47.000
But when you sit down and watch the film for real, what makes an action scene good?

00:47.000 --> 00:53.300
I've watched at least ten films in my time, and I think I've isolated what makes a good action film down to two specific points.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.500
In my experience, good action scenes

00:55.500 --> 00:57.800
COMMUNICATE the action well.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.600
In other words, the physical space of the scene and what's happening in it,

01:00.600 --> 01:06.800
but also advance the story by developing the theme or providing characterization.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.000
Let's start by looking at a film you've never heard of that does neither.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.100
Death Wish 3 is a film about a man who protects the downtrodden by shooting a lot of bad people.

01:16.100 --> 01:22.100
The action itself has a degree of viscera to it, blood, explosions, and so on, but it doesn't get across any particular ideas.

01:22.100 --> 01:27.100
It's a man shooting people with his gun, and you know they deserve it because they dress evil and cackle,

01:27.100 --> 01:28.700
and they're shooting at the good guy.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.100
The violence is huge.

01:30.100 --> 01:35.400
Kersey kills over 70 people on screen in this film, and he does it with an array of massive weapons.

01:35.400 --> 01:41.800
In a good film, action is the result of story, and you're engaged in the action because you care about the characters.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.600
Bad films have bad stories, or no stories at all, and uninteresting characters,

01:45.600 --> 01:48.400
and try to regain your attention with the action.

01:48.400 --> 01:55.000
This isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but when a film has to pull out an actual machine gun and a missile launcher to keep your attention,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.900
that's an admission the film doesn't have any other way of doing it.

01:57.900 --> 02:02.800
Numerous scenes are dedicated to telling you how cool the guns are just to make sure you know.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.600
Oh, a .44 Magnum is a pistol cartridge,

02:05.600 --> 02:12.100
and a .475 Wildey Magnum is a shorter version of the African big game cartridge.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.600
Oh, is this not big enough for you?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.200
How about this machine gun?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.600
Here, look at it. Just look at it for a while.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.500
No, really, there's literally a scene where a guy shows you the machine gun he has, and then they put it back.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.900
Normally, you'd be getting invested in the characters and story, but instead the film has to stop and go,

02:26.900 --> 02:30.400
No, keep watching. The action's coming, and it's gonna be big, we promise.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.100
And then you actually get to the action, and, well, it's just the most uninterestingly shot action you can get.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.900
Shot of Paul shooting he gun.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.900
Shot of bad guys falling down.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.800
Rinse. Repeat.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.700
Dry your hands with the towel dispenser.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.000
Oh, it's out. I'm gonna have to go into the stall and tear off a bunch of toilet paper.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.900
There's one really good piece of action in the film, and it's here.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.300
For 12 frames, this guy really knows how dead he is.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.600
So not only does it not advance the story, but the action is uninteresting, too,

03:00.600 --> 03:03.600
which is the cardinal sin of a crappy budget action film.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.200
There's times when Death Wish Man talks to people, eats with them, and has a nice date with a lady half his age,

03:08.200 --> 03:11.100
and we learn a little more about him and the people he's trying to protect.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.000
But a good film would fuse action and characterization.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.900
You'd learn about Death Wish Man while he was death-wishing

03:16.900 --> 03:20.700
instead of having to stop everything and go have dinner with the nice people downstairs.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.900
Death Wish 3 doesn't tick either of these boxes, but who cares about Death Wish 3?

03:24.900 --> 03:28.800
Instead, let's look at The Avengers, one of the highest-grossing films of all time.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.300
Avengers has some of the worst action scenes I've seen in my entire life.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.500
This is my favorite scene to deconstruct.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.900
It feels off, jarring somehow, doesn't it?

03:38.900 --> 03:40.200
Well, here's why.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.000
Obviously, their heads are nowhere near each other,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.800
so they cut to this other angle for the headbutt,

03:43.800 --> 03:46.300
since you can't see how far apart their heads are from here,

03:46.300 --> 03:48.500
but because they've just cut from this angle,

03:48.500 --> 03:51.400
it's really obvious to the viewer that she hasn't actually hit him

03:51.400 --> 03:53.200
because we know how far apart they are.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.100
It automatically reads as fake,

03:55.100 --> 03:57.600
but then before it cuts back to the previous angle,

03:57.600 --> 04:00.100
this henchman walks right in front of the frame,

04:00.100 --> 04:02.900
so when they cut back to this angle, it's super jarring.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.400
In these two shots, Black Widow flippy-doos off a guy to crush this guy

04:06.400 --> 04:09.600
before he can go for his gun, which he presumably dropped.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.000
I say presumably because whoever shot this scene

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
never shows if he has a gun or if he dropped it or where it went.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.500
He's clearly reaching for something.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.400
They seemingly accidentally obscured what he's reaching for

04:19.400 --> 04:22.100
and forgot to get a pickup shot or put it in the edit,

04:22.100 --> 04:24.500
but since I'm such a nice guy, I decided to help out.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.800
Here's a shot of a hand reaching for a gun that was dropped,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.100
and here's a shot of Scarlett Johansson reacting to that.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.400
Feel free to edit this into the director's cut of the film, Joss,

04:32.400 --> 04:36.300
unless you're too busy smoking Whedon.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.700
Oh, cut this part out.

04:37.700 --> 04:41.200
In other words, the scene fails to communicate what's happening in it.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.000
The editing and cinematography are ridiculously jarring.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.900
Why is this shot sideways?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.600
Why is it back to normal? What?

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
It's sideways again.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.200
Please help me.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.200
Avengers is hurting my brain.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.400
Mistakes like this are all over the series.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.200
It would be too easy to blame Joss Whedon or Jimmy Huzitz

04:57.200 --> 04:59.500
or whoever directed the nightmare that is the Hulk reboot.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.200
Heck, the cinematographer for this scene,

05:01.200 --> 05:03.500
the worst scene in film history, let me remind you,

05:03.500 --> 05:07.500
is Seamus McGarvey, who also did the 2014 Godzilla film,

05:07.500 --> 05:11.300
a.k.a. the best looking thing ever made before Fury Road came out.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.500
So the guy's not an idiot.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
The sheer consistency of these mistakes

05:14.500 --> 05:16.400
leads me to believe that the deeper problem

05:16.400 --> 05:18.300
is with a large company trying to put out

05:18.300 --> 05:20.400
a huge, cohesive, expanded universe

05:20.400 --> 05:22.700
comprising over a dozen movies and counting.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.500
Inevitably, the production is either rushed

05:24.500 --> 05:26.200
or reined in by the corporate types

05:26.200 --> 05:27.500
trying to keep the whole thing together

05:27.500 --> 05:31.100
and on track for 2018 when phase 7 billion starts.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.200
Stoke for Avengers?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.000
I hear Marvel got really hands on this time.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.800
They really pinned in Joss Whedon creatively,

05:35.800 --> 05:37.400
so how could that go wrong?

05:37.400 --> 05:40.200
Ironically, this was the problem with Death Wish 3 as well.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.900
The film was produced by the Canon Group,

05:41.900 --> 05:44.100
famous for rushing all aspects of production

05:44.100 --> 05:47.700
and being run by two of the most cinema-illiterate people of all time.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.000
So what kind of stories can a director unhemmed

05:50.000 --> 05:53.100
by the need to fit a giant pre-existing production pipeline do?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.900
Here's the part where I talk specifically about

05:54.900 --> 05:57.400
Quentin Tarantino for far too long, sorry.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.400
But that's because Tarantino is really good

05:59.400 --> 06:01.200
at telling a story using action.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.600
I mean, look at this famous shot

06:02.600 --> 06:04.100
where you don't even see what's happening.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.700
The camera slides away,

06:05.700 --> 06:07.300
screams, music,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.700
and eventually, Mr. Blonde enters the frame

06:09.700 --> 06:12.500
carrying a fake plastic human ear.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.600
He hasn't just put this guy through something awful.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.100
He's put you through it too

06:16.100 --> 06:18.000
by making you imagine it happening

06:18.000 --> 06:19.700
instead of simply showing it to you.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.800
This makes the audience reflexively hate Mr. Blonde.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.400
It makes you wish that someone could save the cop.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.500
And the fact that now you care

06:27.500 --> 06:29.800
and now you're invested,

06:29.800 --> 06:32.700
that's one of my favorite things that can happen in cinema.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.700
Don't! Don't! Don't!

06:43.400 --> 06:45.300
This is made surprising because the camera work

06:45.300 --> 06:47.300
does everything it can to avoid reminding you

06:47.300 --> 06:49.000
that Mr. Orange is in the room with them.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.200
Even when it pans away,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.600
Mr. Orange would be lying on the ground right down there,

06:52.600 --> 06:55.100
but they angle it just right so you don't see him.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.400
You forget he's there.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.000
This makes the re-emergence of Mr. Orange into the scene

06:59.000 --> 07:00.400
surprising and engaging,

07:00.500 --> 07:02.900
and it does it by mostly not showing you anything.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.100
Reservoir Dog certainly leaves room for improvement

07:05.100 --> 07:06.800
in the visual storytelling department.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.600
Take this scene again from his first film

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
and much less iconic for a good reason.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.700
How does he get across how destructive and surprising

07:12.700 --> 07:16.400
a guy shooting a gun 700 times in public would look?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
Well, there's a couple of screams dubbed in post

07:18.400 --> 07:20.100
and we get a shot of a cop getting hurt.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.600
We don't really learn much about Mr. Pink in this scene

07:22.600 --> 07:24.700
except that he has a magic gun with infinite ammo

07:24.700 --> 07:26.100
and is a really bad shot.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.500
Pink actually took part in the final shootout at the end,

07:28.500 --> 07:30.000
but his bullets missed everyone.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.700
In Dejango Unchained-a,

07:31.700 --> 07:34.200
another Tarantino character kills another lawman.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.300
What has Tarantino learned after 20 years

07:36.300 --> 07:38.000
of pointing cameras at guns?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Dentist Waltz is about to shoot the sheriff with a Derringer.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.800
A Derringer is a tiny gun.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.100
They look really silly.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.200
They're derisively known as purse guns.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.600
It can still kill you, but it looks really silly

07:48.600 --> 07:49.900
if you execute it poorly.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.600
How do you make shooting someone out of nowhere

07:51.600 --> 07:54.900
with a tiny toy-like gun dramatic and big?

07:55.700 --> 07:56.700
Ah!

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
You see that?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.400
It's a tiny gun, but he pulls in

08:01.400 --> 08:03.300
until the thing dominates the frame.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.300
It doesn't look so tiny anymore, does it?

08:05.300 --> 08:06.900
This simple reframing technique

08:06.900 --> 08:08.700
makes all the difference on an audience.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.000
Here's a scene from From Dusk Till Dawn 3

08:11.000 --> 08:13.500
in which a character pulls the same gun out of nowhere.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
Kill her.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.200
It's a less surprising way of doing it, isn't it?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.600
Which is weird because this movie knows

08:21.600 --> 08:23.100
how to make a gun look threatening.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.000
I'm not gonna steal it or nothing.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.500
I just want them to see it up close.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.800
Is this close enough?

08:29.200 --> 08:30.000
Woosh.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.700
But back to Cutie Patootie,

08:31.700 --> 08:34.100
this shot continues to show how surprising this all is

08:34.100 --> 08:36.500
by having a bunch of people react to it in the frame.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.100
But more importantly, we get Schultz's reaction.

08:43.100 --> 08:43.900
He's just like,

08:43.900 --> 08:45.400
whatever, this is my day job.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.600
His lack of reaction is a reaction.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.000
Schultz takes his time with it.

08:49.000 --> 08:49.800
He's clinical,

08:49.800 --> 08:51.900
like some kind of former medical professional.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.100
In the space of less than a minute,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.600
we see two shots from the same gun

08:54.600 --> 08:57.500
and how everyone in the scene feels about those shots,

08:57.500 --> 09:00.400
and we learn a lot about one of our main characters.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.900
He's talked about too much already,

09:01.900 --> 09:03.700
but I still think that modern Hollywood

09:03.700 --> 09:06.500
could stand to learn a lot from the way this guy makes films.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.700
It's standard now on most movies

09:09.700 --> 09:12.700
to, at the very least, have two cameras.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.800
Okay, you have your main shot,

09:14.800 --> 09:16.700
and then there's this other camera,

09:16.700 --> 09:18.700
and then you're just—you're sticking it somewhere.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.100
You know, it's just—it's—it's a sloppy—

09:21.100 --> 09:22.700
it's a sloppy angle,

09:22.700 --> 09:25.100
but it's just there to give you a little bit more footage in the editing room,

09:25.100 --> 09:27.800
and, you know, so you can just kind of get through your day a little bit easier.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.000
I don't want that.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.800
I have one camera on the set,

09:30.800 --> 09:33.100
and the only shot we're shooting is the shot I'm framing.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.600
I frame the shot,

09:34.600 --> 09:37.600
and Bob Richardson lights the shot for that frame,

09:37.600 --> 09:38.800
and that's it.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
And I don't want sloppy-ass crap,

09:40.800 --> 09:43.300
all right, you know, in there that I can just cut to.

09:43.300 --> 09:46.300
Quentin Tarantino has a few weird specific obsessions,

09:46.300 --> 09:48.300
like only using one camera,

09:48.300 --> 09:51.100
shooting on film instead of digital, even in the modern day,

09:51.100 --> 09:52.600
and...feet.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.300
But these obsessions seem to protect him from the garbage

09:55.300 --> 09:57.600
of the modern Hollywood production pipeline.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.400
But you don't have to look to Tarantino for good examples of films

10:00.400 --> 10:02.700
that use good action to tell a great story.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.300
Just get across what's happening well,

10:04.300 --> 10:05.900
and make sure it's happening for a reason

10:05.900 --> 10:08.100
to characters you've made the audience care about.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.600
["Charles"]

10:10.600 --> 10:13.900
Alien takes its time getting to know the crew of the Nostromo

10:13.900 --> 10:16.500
before it sends them into alien murder town,

10:16.500 --> 10:18.900
and it keeps the silly rubber monster suit scary

10:18.900 --> 10:21.500
by being careful with how they show it and when,

10:21.500 --> 10:24.300
and using only brief bursts of violence.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.700
["Wake up!"

10:25.700 --> 10:29.200
["Dallas!"

10:29.200 --> 10:31.100
But enough about not showing action.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.000
What happens when you want to show people what's happening?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.700
Terminator and Terminator 2 both use action flawlessly,

10:36.700 --> 10:37.800
but of course they would.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.400
Everyone knows Terminator 1 is the best film ever made,

10:40.400 --> 10:43.300
but this chase sequence in Terminator 2 is especially good

10:43.300 --> 10:46.000
because the shots contrast the size of the vehicles involved,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.900
reflecting how the T-1000 is a far more advanced machine

10:48.900 --> 10:50.000
than the T-800.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.600
Robert Patrick is a fantastic actor,

10:51.600 --> 10:53.300
but he's not exactly a muscle man.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.800
Making him seem threatening to Arnold

10:54.800 --> 10:57.000
requires visual compositions like this one

10:57.000 --> 10:59.500
to show what's going on under the surface.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.900
The slippy, shiny, CGI-y surface.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.200
This scene used to look good, but it kinda doesn't anymore.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.700
I'll explain why in a future video.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.800
The Avengers movies have comedic writing in them,

11:08.800 --> 11:12.000
but there's rarely comedy in their actual action scenes.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.600
It goes missing somewhere.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.300
I think lots of directors don't even know you can do comedy with visuals.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.400
You can make a scene funny just by how you choreograph movement.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.200
In Fargo, by framing the corpse out,

11:25.200 --> 11:27.100
the Coen brothers create a fantastic shot

11:27.100 --> 11:30.000
of a bleeding Steve Buscemi angrily kicking at nothing,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.400
summing up just how much the character's kidnapping scheme

11:32.400 --> 11:34.500
has gone off the rails in a single image.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.200
The one thing the Coens can definitely teach

11:36.200 --> 11:38.200
is that if you hold with something long enough,

11:38.200 --> 11:39.500
it becomes funny.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.400
Take this scene, where the action

11:41.400 --> 11:43.500
is just a man having a temper tantrum.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.300
Kill it!

11:46.300 --> 11:49.300
A worse filmmaker would cut from here to the next scene,

11:49.300 --> 11:51.200
but instead, they're willing to hold on it,

11:51.200 --> 11:54.100
and they stay there long enough that he realizes how silly he looks

11:54.100 --> 11:55.800
and goes back to scraping his car.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.500
Or this scene, where they hold long enough on Buscemi's tissue-covered face

11:59.500 --> 12:00.800
as he stares at the money

12:00.800 --> 12:04.300
that it becomes inherently funny watching him take himself seriously.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.000
Jesus Christ.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.300
Or this scene in Miller's Crossing,

12:08.300 --> 12:10.800
which stretches this principle past its breaking point

12:10.800 --> 12:14.100
and pushes it into becoming one of the best scenes in film history.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.100
No matter what level of violence you're going for,

12:16.100 --> 12:18.100
it's always possible to get a laugh out of it

12:18.100 --> 12:19.100
if you do it right.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.800
-♪ I am...

12:21.800 --> 12:23.600
I'm...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
I'm a slave...

12:25.600 --> 12:28.100
So there are a lot of good ways you can use the simple act

12:28.100 --> 12:31.100
of a person hurting another person to get something across.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.400
Just think about how to show what's happening.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.900
Maybe don't show any of it.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.900
Ah!

12:37.900 --> 12:39.400
Maybe show too much.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.000
Ah!

12:42.000 --> 12:44.200
You don't need any giant gun props, either.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.900
You just need to know what feelings and ideas you want to communicate with the scene

12:47.900 --> 12:51.200
and execute it in a way that brings these things to the foreground.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.400
You can say a lot by showing very little violence.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.700
Sometimes, you don't even need squibs, or blood, or gore

12:57.700 --> 12:59.900
to imply a character has been killed.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.700
Sometimes, you just need to...

13:01.700 --> 13:02.700
well.

13:02.700 --> 13:09.700
-♪

13:09.700 --> 13:16.700
-♪

13:16.700 --> 13:18.200
-♪ Brudda, budda, cookin'

13:18.200 --> 13:19.700

13:22.200 --> 13:24.200
Thank you all very much for watching.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
I'd like to say a special thanks to

13:26.200 --> 13:27.700
Niels Abildgaard,

13:27.700 --> 13:29.200
Peter Brodeson,

13:29.200 --> 13:30.500

Samael,

13:32.700 --> 13:34.200

LORD OF THE ROACHES,

13:35.700 --> 13:37.200
Scott Gertin,

13:37.200 --> 13:38.700
Sean Higgins,

13:38.700 --> 13:40.000
Thad Wasilewski,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.200
Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes,

13:42.200 --> 13:44.200
and Axelblaze.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
Wait a second.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
Why is...

13:46.200 --> 13:48.500
Why is Axelblaze at the bottom of the list?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.200
I...I try to alphabetize the list,

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
and for some reason, Axelblaze's name is at the bottom.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.700
That doesn't make any se...

13:56.700 --> 13:59.200
Anyway, Axelblaze, if you're watching this,

13:59.200 --> 14:02.700
and I know you are because you're giving me money to make these for some reason,

14:02.700 --> 14:04.700
about five years ago,

14:04.700 --> 14:06.700
you had an avatar on the Something Awful forums

14:06.700 --> 14:08.700
that was, uh, from Adventure Time,

14:08.700 --> 14:11.200
and that avatar sold me on watching the show,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.200
and I really, really liked it,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.200
and it caused me to make radically different life decisions,

14:16.200 --> 14:18.700
and I might not be making these videos

14:18.700 --> 14:20.700
if it weren't for the choices that I was led to make

14:20.700 --> 14:23.700
as a result of watching a cartoon at your non-recommendation,

14:23.700 --> 14:25.700
uh, based on the avatar you had.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.700
So, thanks a lot.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.200
It feels...really weird to be admitting that, you know?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.200
Anyway, see you next time!
