1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
If you watch any big movie trailer released in the last 150 years, as long as it's not a romantic comedy,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,540
you can almost guarantee at some point the trailer devolves into a cacophony of motion, noise, explosions, and fights.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,840
Action inherently tells a story. It's confusing, scary, visceral. Something is happening.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,340
It demands your attention to try to find out what's going on and why.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,160
These trailers continue to get made because they work.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,020
If even one of these quick visuals catches your eye,

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,360
if one of those six frames of a lightsaber with a cross guard made of more lightsaber really catch your fancy,

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,460
that, my friends, is a ticket sale.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,820
Hello, Pirate Bay? Two tickets to StarWars7.mp4, please.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,000
But when you sit down and watch the film for real, what makes an action scene good?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,300
I've watched at least ten films in my time, and I think I've isolated what makes a good action film down to two specific points.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,500
In my experience, good action scenes

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,800
COMMUNICATE the action well.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
In other words, the physical space of the scene and what's happening in it,

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,800
but also advance the story by developing the theme or providing characterization.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's start by looking at a film you've never heard of that does neither.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,100
Death Wish 3 is a film about a man who protects the downtrodden by shooting a lot of bad people.

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,100
The action itself has a degree of viscera to it, blood, explosions, and so on, but it doesn't get across any particular ideas.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,100
It's a man shooting people with his gun, and you know they deserve it because they dress evil and cackle,

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,700
and they're shooting at the good guy.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,100
The violence is huge.

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,400
Kersey kills over 70 people on screen in this film, and he does it with an array of massive weapons.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,800
In a good film, action is the result of story, and you're engaged in the action because you care about the characters.

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,600
Bad films have bad stories, or no stories at all, and uninteresting characters,

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
and try to regain your attention with the action.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,000
This isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but when a film has to pull out an actual machine gun and a missile launcher to keep your attention,

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,900
that's an admission the film doesn't have any other way of doing it.

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,800
Numerous scenes are dedicated to telling you how cool the guns are just to make sure you know.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
Oh, a .44 Magnum is a pistol cartridge,

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,100
and a .475 Wildey Magnum is a shorter version of the African big game cartridge.

31
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh, is this not big enough for you?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,200
How about this machine gun?

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,600
Here, look at it. Just look at it for a while.

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,500
No, really, there's literally a scene where a guy shows you the machine gun he has, and then they put it back.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,900
Normally, you'd be getting invested in the characters and story, but instead the film has to stop and go,

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,400
No, keep watching. The action's coming, and it's gonna be big, we promise.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,100
And then you actually get to the action, and, well, it's just the most uninterestingly shot action you can get.

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,900
Shot of Paul shooting he gun.

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Shot of bad guys falling down.

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,800
Rinse. Repeat.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Dry your hands with the towel dispenser.

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, it's out. I'm gonna have to go into the stall and tear off a bunch of toilet paper.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,900
There's one really good piece of action in the film, and it's here.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,300
For 12 frames, this guy really knows how dead he is.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,600
So not only does it not advance the story, but the action is uninteresting, too,

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
which is the cardinal sin of a crappy budget action film.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,200
There's times when Death Wish Man talks to people, eats with them, and has a nice date with a lady half his age,

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,100
and we learn a little more about him and the people he's trying to protect.

49
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,000
But a good film would fuse action and characterization.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,900
You'd learn about Death Wish Man while he was death-wishing

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,700
instead of having to stop everything and go have dinner with the nice people downstairs.

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,900
Death Wish 3 doesn't tick either of these boxes, but who cares about Death Wish 3?

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,800
Instead, let's look at The Avengers, one of the highest-grossing films of all time.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,300
Avengers has some of the worst action scenes I've seen in my entire life.

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,500
This is my favorite scene to deconstruct.

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,900
It feels off, jarring somehow, doesn't it?

57
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,200
Well, here's why.

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Obviously, their heads are nowhere near each other,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
so they cut to this other angle for the headbutt,

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,300
since you can't see how far apart their heads are from here,

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,500
but because they've just cut from this angle,

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,400
it's really obvious to the viewer that she hasn't actually hit him

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
because we know how far apart they are.

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,100
It automatically reads as fake,

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,600
but then before it cuts back to the previous angle,

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
this henchman walks right in front of the frame,

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,900
so when they cut back to this angle, it's super jarring.

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,400
In these two shots, Black Widow flippy-doos off a guy to crush this guy

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,600
before he can go for his gun, which he presumably dropped.

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
I say presumably because whoever shot this scene

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
never shows if he has a gun or if he dropped it or where it went.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
He's clearly reaching for something.

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,400
They seemingly accidentally obscured what he's reaching for

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,100
and forgot to get a pickup shot or put it in the edit,

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,500
but since I'm such a nice guy, I decided to help out.

76
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,800
Here's a shot of a hand reaching for a gun that was dropped,

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,100
and here's a shot of Scarlett Johansson reacting to that.

78
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,400
Feel free to edit this into the director's cut of the film, Joss,

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,300
unless you're too busy smoking Whedon.

80
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Oh, cut this part out.

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,200
In other words, the scene fails to communicate what's happening in it.

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,000
The editing and cinematography are ridiculously jarring.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,900
Why is this shot sideways?

84
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,600
Why is it back to normal? What?

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
It's sideways again.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Please help me.

87
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Avengers is hurting my brain.

88
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Mistakes like this are all over the series.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
It would be too easy to blame Joss Whedon or Jimmy Huzitz

90
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,500
or whoever directed the nightmare that is the Hulk reboot.

91
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
Heck, the cinematographer for this scene,

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,500
the worst scene in film history, let me remind you,

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
is Seamus McGarvey, who also did the 2014 Godzilla film,

94
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,300
a.k.a. the best looking thing ever made before Fury Road came out.

95
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
So the guy's not an idiot.

96
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
The sheer consistency of these mistakes

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,400
leads me to believe that the deeper problem

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,300
is with a large company trying to put out

99
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,400
a huge, cohesive, expanded universe

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,700
comprising over a dozen movies and counting.

101
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,500
Inevitably, the production is either rushed

102
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,200
or reined in by the corporate types

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,500
trying to keep the whole thing together

104
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,100
and on track for 2018 when phase 7 billion starts.

105
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,200
Stoke for Avengers?

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
I hear Marvel got really hands on this time.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
They really pinned in Joss Whedon creatively,

108
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,400
so how could that go wrong?

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Ironically, this was the problem with Death Wish 3 as well.

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,900
The film was produced by the Canon Group,

111
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
famous for rushing all aspects of production

112
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,700
and being run by two of the most cinema-illiterate people of all time.

113
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,000
So what kind of stories can a director unhemmed

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,100
by the need to fit a giant pre-existing production pipeline do?

115
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
Here's the part where I talk specifically about

116
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,400
Quentin Tarantino for far too long, sorry.

117
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
But that's because Tarantino is really good

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
at telling a story using action.

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
I mean, look at this famous shot

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,100
where you don't even see what's happening.

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,700
The camera slides away,

122
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,300
screams, music,

123
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,700
and eventually, Mr. Blonde enters the frame

124
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,500
carrying a fake plastic human ear.

125
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,600
He hasn't just put this guy through something awful.

126
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,100
He's put you through it too

127
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,000
by making you imagine it happening

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,700
instead of simply showing it to you.

129
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,800
This makes the audience reflexively hate Mr. Blonde.

130
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,400
It makes you wish that someone could save the cop.

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,500
And the fact that now you care

132
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,800
and now you're invested,

133
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,700
that's one of my favorite things that can happen in cinema.

134
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Don't! Don't! Don't!

135
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,300
This is made surprising because the camera work

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
does everything it can to avoid reminding you

137
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,000
that Mr. Orange is in the room with them.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Even when it pans away,

139
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Mr. Orange would be lying on the ground right down there,

140
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,100
but they angle it just right so you don't see him.

141
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,400
You forget he's there.

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,000
This makes the re-emergence of Mr. Orange into the scene

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
surprising and engaging,

144
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,900
and it does it by mostly not showing you anything.

145
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,100
Reservoir Dog certainly leaves room for improvement

146
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,800
in the visual storytelling department.

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
Take this scene again from his first film

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
and much less iconic for a good reason.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,700
How does he get across how destructive and surprising

150
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,400
a guy shooting a gun 700 times in public would look?

151
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Well, there's a couple of screams dubbed in post

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,100
and we get a shot of a cop getting hurt.

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,600
We don't really learn much about Mr. Pink in this scene

154
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,700
except that he has a magic gun with infinite ammo

155
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,100
and is a really bad shot.

156
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
Pink actually took part in the final shootout at the end,

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
but his bullets missed everyone.

158
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,700
In Dejango Unchained-a,

159
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,200
another Tarantino character kills another lawman.

160
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
What has Tarantino learned after 20 years

161
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,000
of pointing cameras at guns?

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Dentist Waltz is about to shoot the sheriff with a Derringer.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
A Derringer is a tiny gun.

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,100
They look really silly.

165
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
They're derisively known as purse guns.

166
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
It can still kill you, but it looks really silly

167
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,900
if you execute it poorly.

168
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,600
How do you make shooting someone out of nowhere

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,900
with a tiny toy-like gun dramatic and big?

170
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Ah!

171
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
You see that?

172
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,400
It's a tiny gun, but he pulls in

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,300
until the thing dominates the frame.

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
It doesn't look so tiny anymore, does it?

175
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
This simple reframing technique

176
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,700
makes all the difference on an audience.

177
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Here's a scene from From Dusk Till Dawn 3

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
in which a character pulls the same gun out of nowhere.

179
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Kill her.

180
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,200
It's a less surprising way of doing it, isn't it?

181
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
Which is weird because this movie knows

182
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,100
how to make a gun look threatening.

183
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not gonna steal it or nothing.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
I just want them to see it up close.

185
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,800
Is this close enough?

186
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
Woosh.

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,700
But back to Cutie Patootie,

188
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,100
this shot continues to show how surprising this all is

189
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,500
by having a bunch of people react to it in the frame.

190
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,100
But more importantly, we get Schultz's reaction.

191
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,900
He's just like,

192
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,400
whatever, this is my day job.

193
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
His lack of reaction is a reaction.

194
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Schultz takes his time with it.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,800
He's clinical,

196
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,900
like some kind of former medical professional.

197
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,100
In the space of less than a minute,

198
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
we see two shots from the same gun

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,500
and how everyone in the scene feels about those shots,

200
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,400
and we learn a lot about one of our main characters.

201
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
He's talked about too much already,

202
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,700
but I still think that modern Hollywood

203
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,500
could stand to learn a lot from the way this guy makes films.

204
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,700
It's standard now on most movies

205
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
to, at the very least, have two cameras.

206
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,800
Okay, you have your main shot,

207
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,700
and then there's this other camera,

208
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
and then you're just—you're sticking it somewhere.

209
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,100
You know, it's just—it's—it's a sloppy—

210
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,700
it's a sloppy angle,

211
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,100
but it's just there to give you a little bit more footage in the editing room,

212
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
and, you know, so you can just kind of get through your day a little bit easier.

213
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't want that.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
I have one camera on the set,

215
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,100
and the only shot we're shooting is the shot I'm framing.

216
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,600
I frame the shot,

217
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
and Bob Richardson lights the shot for that frame,

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
and that's it.

219
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
And I don't want sloppy-ass crap,

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
all right, you know, in there that I can just cut to.

221
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Quentin Tarantino has a few weird specific obsessions,

222
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
like only using one camera,

223
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,100
shooting on film instead of digital, even in the modern day,

224
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,600
and...feet.

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,300
But these obsessions seem to protect him from the garbage

226
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,600
of the modern Hollywood production pipeline.

227
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,400
But you don't have to look to Tarantino for good examples of films

228
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,700
that use good action to tell a great story.

229
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,300
Just get across what's happening well,

230
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
and make sure it's happening for a reason

231
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,100
to characters you've made the audience care about.

232
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,600
["Charles"]

233
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,900
Alien takes its time getting to know the crew of the Nostromo

234
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,500
before it sends them into alien murder town,

235
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,900
and it keeps the silly rubber monster suit scary

236
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,500
by being careful with how they show it and when,

237
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,300
and using only brief bursts of violence.

238
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,700
["Wake up!"

239
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,200
["Dallas!"

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,100
But enough about not showing action.

241
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,000
What happens when you want to show people what's happening?

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,700
Terminator and Terminator 2 both use action flawlessly,

243
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,800
but of course they would.

244
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Everyone knows Terminator 1 is the best film ever made,

245
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,300
but this chase sequence in Terminator 2 is especially good

246
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,000
because the shots contrast the size of the vehicles involved,

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,900
reflecting how the T-1000 is a far more advanced machine

248
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,000
than the T-800.

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Robert Patrick is a fantastic actor,

250
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,300
but he's not exactly a muscle man.

251
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,800
Making him seem threatening to Arnold

252
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,000
requires visual compositions like this one

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
to show what's going on under the surface.

254
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,900
The slippy, shiny, CGI-y surface.

255
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,200
This scene used to look good, but it kinda doesn't anymore.

256
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,700
I'll explain why in a future video.

257
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,800
The Avengers movies have comedic writing in them,

258
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,000
but there's rarely comedy in their actual action scenes.

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
It goes missing somewhere.

260
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,300
I think lots of directors don't even know you can do comedy with visuals.

261
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,400
You can make a scene funny just by how you choreograph movement.

262
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,200
In Fargo, by framing the corpse out,

263
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,100
the Coen brothers create a fantastic shot

264
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,000
of a bleeding Steve Buscemi angrily kicking at nothing,

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,400
summing up just how much the character's kidnapping scheme

266
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
has gone off the rails in a single image.

267
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,200
The one thing the Coens can definitely teach

268
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
is that if you hold with something long enough,

269
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,500
it becomes funny.

270
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,400
Take this scene, where the action

271
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,500
is just a man having a temper tantrum.

272
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,300
Kill it!

273
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,300
A worse filmmaker would cut from here to the next scene,

274
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,200
but instead, they're willing to hold on it,

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,100
and they stay there long enough that he realizes how silly he looks

276
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,800
and goes back to scraping his car.

277
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,500
Or this scene, where they hold long enough on Buscemi's tissue-covered face

278
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,800
as he stares at the money

279
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,300
that it becomes inherently funny watching him take himself seriously.

280
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,000
Jesus Christ.

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,300
Or this scene in Miller's Crossing,

282
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,800
which stretches this principle past its breaking point

283
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,100
and pushes it into becoming one of the best scenes in film history.

284
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
No matter what level of violence you're going for,

285
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
it's always possible to get a laugh out of it

286
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
if you do it right.

287
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,800
-♪ I am...

288
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm...

289
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I'm a slave...

290
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,100
So there are a lot of good ways you can use the simple act

291
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
of a person hurting another person to get something across.

292
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,400
Just think about how to show what's happening.

293
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,900
Maybe don't show any of it.

294
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Ah!

295
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,400
Maybe show too much.

296
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Ah!

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,200
You don't need any giant gun props, either.

298
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,900
You just need to know what feelings and ideas you want to communicate with the scene

299
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,200
and execute it in a way that brings these things to the foreground.

300
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,400
You can say a lot by showing very little violence.

301
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,700
Sometimes, you don't even need squibs, or blood, or gore

302
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,900
to imply a character has been killed.

303
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,700
Sometimes, you just need to...

304
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
well.

305
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,700
-♪

306
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:16,700

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,200

Thank you all very much for watching.

312
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I'd like to say a special thanks to

313
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,700
Niels Abildgaard,

LORD OF THE ROACHES,

Scott Gertin,

Thad Wasilewski,

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes,

324
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
and Axelblaze.

325
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Wait a second.

326
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Why is...

327
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,500
Why is Axelblaze at the bottom of the list?

328
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,200
I...I try to alphabetize the list,

329
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
and for some reason, Axelblaze's name is at the bottom.

330
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
That doesn't make any se...

331
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Anyway, Axelblaze, if you're watching this,

332
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,700
and I know you are because you're giving me money to make these for some reason,

333
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
about five years ago,

334
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
you had an avatar on the Something Awful forums

335
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
that was, uh, from Adventure Time,

336
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,200
and that avatar sold me on watching the show,

337
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
and I really, really liked it,

338
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
and it caused me to make radically different life decisions,

339
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,700
and I might not be making these videos

340
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
if it weren't for the choices that I was led to make

341
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
as a result of watching a cartoon at your non-recommendation,

342
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
uh, based on the avatar you had.

343
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
So, thanks a lot.

344
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,200
It feels...really weird to be admitting that, you know?

345
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Anyway, see you next time!
