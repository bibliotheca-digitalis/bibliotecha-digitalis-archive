0	8400	If you watch any big movie trailer released in the last 150 years, as long as it's not a romantic comedy,
8400	14540	you can almost guarantee at some point the trailer devolves into a cacophony of motion, noise, explosions, and fights.
14540	19840	Action inherently tells a story. It's confusing, scary, visceral. Something is happening.
19840	23340	It demands your attention to try to find out what's going on and why.
23340	26160	These trailers continue to get made because they work.
26200	29020	If even one of these quick visuals catches your eye,
29020	35360	if one of those six frames of a lightsaber with a cross guard made of more lightsaber really catch your fancy,
35360	37460	that, my friends, is a ticket sale.
37460	41820	Hello, Pirate Bay? Two tickets to StarWars7.mp4, please.
42860	47000	But when you sit down and watch the film for real, what makes an action scene good?
47000	53300	I've watched at least ten films in my time, and I think I've isolated what makes a good action film down to two specific points.
53300	55500	In my experience, good action scenes
55500	57800	COMMUNICATE the action well.
57800	60600	In other words, the physical space of the scene and what's happening in it,
60600	66800	but also advance the story by developing the theme or providing characterization.
66800	70000	Let's start by looking at a film you've never heard of that does neither.
70000	76100	Death Wish 3 is a film about a man who protects the downtrodden by shooting a lot of bad people.
76100	82100	The action itself has a degree of viscera to it, blood, explosions, and so on, but it doesn't get across any particular ideas.
82100	87100	It's a man shooting people with his gun, and you know they deserve it because they dress evil and cackle,
87100	88700	and they're shooting at the good guy.
88700	90100	The violence is huge.
90100	95400	Kersey kills over 70 people on screen in this film, and he does it with an array of massive weapons.
95400	101800	In a good film, action is the result of story, and you're engaged in the action because you care about the characters.
101800	105600	Bad films have bad stories, or no stories at all, and uninteresting characters,
105600	108400	and try to regain your attention with the action.
108400	115000	This isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but when a film has to pull out an actual machine gun and a missile launcher to keep your attention,
115000	117900	that's an admission the film doesn't have any other way of doing it.
117900	122800	Numerous scenes are dedicated to telling you how cool the guns are just to make sure you know.
122800	125600	Oh, a .44 Magnum is a pistol cartridge,
125600	132100	and a .475 Wildey Magnum is a shorter version of the African big game cartridge.
132100	133600	Oh, is this not big enough for you?
133600	135200	How about this machine gun?
135200	137600	Here, look at it. Just look at it for a while.
137700	142500	No, really, there's literally a scene where a guy shows you the machine gun he has, and then they put it back.
142500	146900	Normally, you'd be getting invested in the characters and story, but instead the film has to stop and go,
146900	150400	No, keep watching. The action's coming, and it's gonna be big, we promise.
150400	155100	And then you actually get to the action, and, well, it's just the most uninterestingly shot action you can get.
155100	156900	Shot of Paul shooting he gun.
156900	158900	Shot of bad guys falling down.
158900	160800	Rinse. Repeat.
160800	162700	Dry your hands with the towel dispenser.
162700	166000	Oh, it's out. I'm gonna have to go into the stall and tear off a bunch of toilet paper.
166000	168900	There's one really good piece of action in the film, and it's here.
171600	175300	For 12 frames, this guy really knows how dead he is.
176800	180600	So not only does it not advance the story, but the action is uninteresting, too,
180600	183600	which is the cardinal sin of a crappy budget action film.
183600	188200	There's times when Death Wish Man talks to people, eats with them, and has a nice date with a lady half his age,
188200	191100	and we learn a little more about him and the people he's trying to protect.
191100	194000	But a good film would fuse action and characterization.
194000	196900	You'd learn about Death Wish Man while he was death-wishing
196900	200700	instead of having to stop everything and go have dinner with the nice people downstairs.
200700	204900	Death Wish 3 doesn't tick either of these boxes, but who cares about Death Wish 3?
204900	208800	Instead, let's look at The Avengers, one of the highest-grossing films of all time.
208800	212300	Avengers has some of the worst action scenes I've seen in my entire life.
212300	214500	This is my favorite scene to deconstruct.
216300	218900	It feels off, jarring somehow, doesn't it?
218900	220200	Well, here's why.
220200	222000	Obviously, their heads are nowhere near each other,
222000	223800	so they cut to this other angle for the headbutt,
223800	226300	since you can't see how far apart their heads are from here,
226300	228500	but because they've just cut from this angle,
228500	231400	it's really obvious to the viewer that she hasn't actually hit him
231400	233200	because we know how far apart they are.
233200	235100	It automatically reads as fake,
235100	237600	but then before it cuts back to the previous angle,
237600	240100	this henchman walks right in front of the frame,
240100	242900	so when they cut back to this angle, it's super jarring.
242900	246400	In these two shots, Black Widow flippy-doos off a guy to crush this guy
246400	249600	before he can go for his gun, which he presumably dropped.
249600	252000	I say presumably because whoever shot this scene
252000	255000	never shows if he has a gun or if he dropped it or where it went.
255000	256500	He's clearly reaching for something.
256500	259400	They seemingly accidentally obscured what he's reaching for
259400	262100	and forgot to get a pickup shot or put it in the edit,
262100	264500	but since I'm such a nice guy, I decided to help out.
264500	266800	Here's a shot of a hand reaching for a gun that was dropped,
266800	269100	and here's a shot of Scarlett Johansson reacting to that.
269100	272400	Feel free to edit this into the director's cut of the film, Joss,
272400	276300	unless you're too busy smoking Whedon.
276300	277700	Oh, cut this part out.
277700	281200	In other words, the scene fails to communicate what's happening in it.
281200	284000	The editing and cinematography are ridiculously jarring.
284000	285900	Why is this shot sideways?
285900	287600	Why is it back to normal? What?
287600	288800	It's sideways again.
288800	290200	Please help me.
290200	292200	Avengers is hurting my brain.
292200	294400	Mistakes like this are all over the series.
294400	297200	It would be too easy to blame Joss Whedon or Jimmy Huzitz
297200	299500	or whoever directed the nightmare that is the Hulk reboot.
299500	301200	Heck, the cinematographer for this scene,
301200	303500	the worst scene in film history, let me remind you,
303500	307500	is Seamus McGarvey, who also did the 2014 Godzilla film,
307500	311300	a.k.a. the best looking thing ever made before Fury Road came out.
311300	312500	So the guy's not an idiot.
312500	314500	The sheer consistency of these mistakes
314500	316400	leads me to believe that the deeper problem
316400	318300	is with a large company trying to put out
318300	320400	a huge, cohesive, expanded universe
320400	322700	comprising over a dozen movies and counting.
322700	324500	Inevitably, the production is either rushed
324500	326200	or reined in by the corporate types
326200	327500	trying to keep the whole thing together
327500	331100	and on track for 2018 when phase 7 billion starts.
331100	332200	Stoke for Avengers?
332200	334000	I hear Marvel got really hands on this time.
334000	335800	They really pinned in Joss Whedon creatively,
335800	337400	so how could that go wrong?
337400	340200	Ironically, this was the problem with Death Wish 3 as well.
340200	341900	The film was produced by the Canon Group,
341900	344100	famous for rushing all aspects of production
344100	347700	and being run by two of the most cinema-illiterate people of all time.
347700	350000	So what kind of stories can a director unhemmed
350000	353100	by the need to fit a giant pre-existing production pipeline do?
353100	354900	Here's the part where I talk specifically about
354900	357400	Quentin Tarantino for far too long, sorry.
357400	359400	But that's because Tarantino is really good
359400	361200	at telling a story using action.
361200	362600	I mean, look at this famous shot
362600	364100	where you don't even see what's happening.
364100	365700	The camera slides away,
365700	367300	screams, music,
367300	369700	and eventually, Mr. Blonde enters the frame
369700	372500	carrying a fake plastic human ear.
372500	374600	He hasn't just put this guy through something awful.
374600	376100	He's put you through it too
376100	378000	by making you imagine it happening
378000	379700	instead of simply showing it to you.
379700	382800	This makes the audience reflexively hate Mr. Blonde.
382800	385400	It makes you wish that someone could save the cop.
385400	387500	And the fact that now you care
387500	389800	and now you're invested,
389800	392700	that's one of my favorite things that can happen in cinema.
392700	394700	Don't! Don't! Don't!
403400	405300	This is made surprising because the camera work
405300	407300	does everything it can to avoid reminding you
407300	409000	that Mr. Orange is in the room with them.
409000	410200	Even when it pans away,
410200	412600	Mr. Orange would be lying on the ground right down there,
412600	415100	but they angle it just right so you don't see him.
415100	416400	You forget he's there.
416400	419000	This makes the re-emergence of Mr. Orange into the scene
419000	420400	surprising and engaging,
420500	422900	and it does it by mostly not showing you anything.
422900	425100	Reservoir Dog certainly leaves room for improvement
425100	426800	in the visual storytelling department.
426800	428600	Take this scene again from his first film
428600	430600	and much less iconic for a good reason.
430600	432700	How does he get across how destructive and surprising
432700	436400	a guy shooting a gun 700 times in public would look?
436400	438400	Well, there's a couple of screams dubbed in post
438400	440100	and we get a shot of a cop getting hurt.
440100	442600	We don't really learn much about Mr. Pink in this scene
442600	444700	except that he has a magic gun with infinite ammo
444700	446100	and is a really bad shot.
446100	448500	Pink actually took part in the final shootout at the end,
448500	450000	but his bullets missed everyone.
450100	451700	In Dejango Unchained-a,
451700	454200	another Tarantino character kills another lawman.
454200	456300	What has Tarantino learned after 20 years
456300	458000	of pointing cameras at guns?
458000	461000	Dentist Waltz is about to shoot the sheriff with a Derringer.
461000	462800	A Derringer is a tiny gun.
462800	464100	They look really silly.
464100	466200	They're derisively known as purse guns.
466200	468600	It can still kill you, but it looks really silly
468600	469900	if you execute it poorly.
469900	471600	How do you make shooting someone out of nowhere
471600	474900	with a tiny toy-like gun dramatic and big?
475700	476700	Ah!
478500	479500	You see that?
479500	481400	It's a tiny gun, but he pulls in
481400	483300	until the thing dominates the frame.
483300	485300	It doesn't look so tiny anymore, does it?
485300	486900	This simple reframing technique
486900	488700	makes all the difference on an audience.
488700	491000	Here's a scene from From Dusk Till Dawn 3
491000	493500	in which a character pulls the same gun out of nowhere.
494300	495300	Kill her.
498300	500200	It's a less surprising way of doing it, isn't it?
500200	501600	Which is weird because this movie knows
501600	503100	how to make a gun look threatening.
503200	505000	I'm not gonna steal it or nothing.
505000	506500	I just want them to see it up close.
506500	507800	Is this close enough?
509200	510000	Woosh.
510000	511700	But back to Cutie Patootie,
511700	514100	this shot continues to show how surprising this all is
514100	516500	by having a bunch of people react to it in the frame.
520500	523100	But more importantly, we get Schultz's reaction.
523100	523900	He's just like,
523900	525400	whatever, this is my day job.
525400	527600	His lack of reaction is a reaction.
527600	529000	Schultz takes his time with it.
529000	529800	He's clinical,
529800	531900	like some kind of former medical professional.
531900	533100	In the space of less than a minute,
533100	534600	we see two shots from the same gun
534600	537500	and how everyone in the scene feels about those shots,
537500	540400	and we learn a lot about one of our main characters.
540400	541900	He's talked about too much already,
541900	543700	but I still think that modern Hollywood
543700	546500	could stand to learn a lot from the way this guy makes films.
546500	549700	It's standard now on most movies
549700	552700	to, at the very least, have two cameras.
552700	554800	Okay, you have your main shot,
554800	556700	and then there's this other camera,
556700	558700	and then you're just—you're sticking it somewhere.
558700	561100	You know, it's just—it's—it's a sloppy—
561100	562700	it's a sloppy angle,
562700	565100	but it's just there to give you a little bit more footage in the editing room,
565100	567800	and, you know, so you can just kind of get through your day a little bit easier.
567800	569000	I don't want that.
569000	570800	I have one camera on the set,
570800	573100	and the only shot we're shooting is the shot I'm framing.
573100	574600	I frame the shot,
574600	577600	and Bob Richardson lights the shot for that frame,
577600	578800	and that's it.
578800	580800	And I don't want sloppy-ass crap,
580800	583300	all right, you know, in there that I can just cut to.
583300	586300	Quentin Tarantino has a few weird specific obsessions,
586300	588300	like only using one camera,
588300	591100	shooting on film instead of digital, even in the modern day,
591100	592600	and...feet.
592600	595300	But these obsessions seem to protect him from the garbage
595300	597600	of the modern Hollywood production pipeline.
597600	600400	But you don't have to look to Tarantino for good examples of films
600400	602700	that use good action to tell a great story.
602700	604300	Just get across what's happening well,
604300	605900	and make sure it's happening for a reason
605900	608100	to characters you've made the audience care about.
608100	610600	["Charles"]
610600	613900	Alien takes its time getting to know the crew of the Nostromo
613900	616500	before it sends them into alien murder town,
616500	618900	and it keeps the silly rubber monster suit scary
618900	621500	by being careful with how they show it and when,
621500	624300	and using only brief bursts of violence.
624300	625700	["Wake up!"
625700	629200	["Dallas!"
629200	631100	But enough about not showing action.
631100	634000	What happens when you want to show people what's happening?
634000	636700	Terminator and Terminator 2 both use action flawlessly,
636700	637800	but of course they would.
637800	640400	Everyone knows Terminator 1 is the best film ever made,
640400	643300	but this chase sequence in Terminator 2 is especially good
643300	646000	because the shots contrast the size of the vehicles involved,
646000	648900	reflecting how the T-1000 is a far more advanced machine
648900	650000	than the T-800.
650000	651600	Robert Patrick is a fantastic actor,
651600	653300	but he's not exactly a muscle man.
653300	654800	Making him seem threatening to Arnold
654800	657000	requires visual compositions like this one
657000	659500	to show what's going on under the surface.
659500	662900	The slippy, shiny, CGI-y surface.
662900	665200	This scene used to look good, but it kinda doesn't anymore.
665200	666700	I'll explain why in a future video.
666700	668800	The Avengers movies have comedic writing in them,
668800	672000	but there's rarely comedy in their actual action scenes.
672000	673600	It goes missing somewhere.
673600	677300	I think lots of directors don't even know you can do comedy with visuals.
677300	680400	You can make a scene funny just by how you choreograph movement.
682900	685200	In Fargo, by framing the corpse out,
685200	687100	the Coen brothers create a fantastic shot
687100	690000	of a bleeding Steve Buscemi angrily kicking at nothing,
690000	692400	summing up just how much the character's kidnapping scheme
692400	694500	has gone off the rails in a single image.
694500	696200	The one thing the Coens can definitely teach
696200	698200	is that if you hold with something long enough,
698200	699500	it becomes funny.
699500	701400	Take this scene, where the action
701400	703500	is just a man having a temper tantrum.
704200	706300	Kill it!
706300	709300	A worse filmmaker would cut from here to the next scene,
709300	711200	but instead, they're willing to hold on it,
711200	714100	and they stay there long enough that he realizes how silly he looks
714100	715800	and goes back to scraping his car.
715800	719500	Or this scene, where they hold long enough on Buscemi's tissue-covered face
719500	720800	as he stares at the money
720800	724300	that it becomes inherently funny watching him take himself seriously.
725300	727000	Jesus Christ.
727000	728300	Or this scene in Miller's Crossing,
728300	730800	which stretches this principle past its breaking point
730800	734100	and pushes it into becoming one of the best scenes in film history.
734100	736100	No matter what level of violence you're going for,
736100	738100	it's always possible to get a laugh out of it
738100	739100	if you do it right.
739100	741800	-♪ I am...
741800	743600	I'm...
743600	745600	I'm a slave...
745600	748100	So there are a lot of good ways you can use the simple act
748100	751100	of a person hurting another person to get something across.
751100	753400	Just think about how to show what's happening.
753400	754900	Maybe don't show any of it.
754900	757900	Ah!
757900	759400	Maybe show too much.
759500	762000	Ah!
762000	764200	You don't need any giant gun props, either.
764200	767900	You just need to know what feelings and ideas you want to communicate with the scene
767900	771200	and execute it in a way that brings these things to the foreground.
771200	774400	You can say a lot by showing very little violence.
774400	777700	Sometimes, you don't even need squibs, or blood, or gore
777700	779900	to imply a character has been killed.
779900	781700	Sometimes, you just need to...
781700	782700	well.

804200	806200	I'd like to say a special thanks to

818700	820000	Thad Wasilewski,
820000	822200	Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes,
822200	824200	and Axelblaze.
824200	825200	Wait a second.
825200	826200	Why is...
826200	828500	Why is Axelblaze at the bottom of the list?
828500	831200	I...I try to alphabetize the list,
831200	834200	and for some reason, Axelblaze's name is at the bottom.
834200	835700	That doesn't make any se...
836700	839200	Anyway, Axelblaze, if you're watching this,
839200	842700	and I know you are because you're giving me money to make these for some reason,
842700	844700	about five years ago,
844700	846700	you had an avatar on the Something Awful forums
846700	848700	that was, uh, from Adventure Time,
848700	851200	and that avatar sold me on watching the show,
851200	853200	and I really, really liked it,
853200	856200	and it caused me to make radically different life decisions,
856200	858700	and I might not be making these videos
858700	860700	if it weren't for the choices that I was led to make
860700	863700	as a result of watching a cartoon at your non-recommendation,
863700	865700	uh, based on the avatar you had.
865700	867700	So, thanks a lot.
867700	871200	It feels...really weird to be admitting that, you know?
871200	873200	Anyway, see you next time!
