1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
I'm going to go out of my way for once and talk about something positive.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,540
I'm going to talk about a game I really, really like.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,740
I'm going to talk about Bloodborne, and why it's amazing.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,420
["Bloodborne Theme Song"]

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,720
["Bloodborne Theme Song Fades Out"]

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,260
["Bloodborne Theme Song Fades In"]

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,180
Okay, to start off, we're going to have to establish a baseline, aren't we?

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,180
Bloodborne's amazing, but the Souls series has always been good.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,480
Let's start by talking in basic terms about the core gameplay.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,020
They are, when you boil it down, basically action games attempting to recreate the same sort of stuff

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons were designed to simulate.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,320
Adventures in magical lands with dungeons and or dragons.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,460
They control in a vaguely similar way to other third-person action games like Devil May Cry,

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,040
or Drakengard, or Dynasty Warriors, or even The Legend of Zelda.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,480
However, despite superficial resemblance, in practice, the games operate very differently from those.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,620
All the games I just mentioned here have a focus on instantaneousness, fluidity, and flow or speed.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,900
You press the button, and the character is immediately doing the thing.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,500
Dante is doing the stabby, or the jumpy, or the flippy as soon as you press the button commanding him to do it.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
He's such a good boy.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,580
In lots of these games, you can even cancel a move you're currently doing into another move.

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,380
So if you realized you actually pressed the wrong button, you can get away with pressing the right one,

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,040
and Dante cleans up after your mistakes for you.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
It's like McDonald's or Casual Sex.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,500
It's... fine?

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,340
You know, like, it'll do?

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,080
But outside of higher difficulties, there's this sense of never really earning anything to me.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,220
I hit the relevant button based on when it was clearly telegraphing that I should be doing it,

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,640
and then it happened instantly.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,300
It's missing something.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,720
The Souls games are theoretically similar, but choose such a different core design philosophy

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,260
that I bet some of you winced when I compared them to character action games the way I just did.

32
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,300
When you press the attack button in a Souls game, you've not just committed to an attack.

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,260
You've committed to the long, arduous process of signing the proper paperwork to get planning permission

34
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,380
to start to swing your sword.

35
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,100
You don't immediately see dividends on the button you pressed.

36
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,060
You have to wait for the attack to go off.

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,220
On top of that, instead of attacking and moving being an infinite resource,

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,060
you have a limited amount of stamina you can invest at any given time.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,280
So you can't rely on mashing the attack and dodge buttons to get by.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,580
And then, if you press the wrong button, you can't hit undo.

41
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,580
You can't cancel out of an attack into the roll you should have done.

42
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,340
You get stabbed instead.

43
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,540
This creates an immediate friction between you and what you want to achieve.

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,780
You can't just hit the button when you see an opening,

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,460
or dance around and wait until one gets handed to you.

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,820
You have to learn to prepare and observe the timing of your enemy,

47
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,020
and be able to know when to act instead of simply acting,

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,820
or use your limited stamina resource to create an opening by dodging an early attack.

49
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,260
This is the main reason why the series has always been a little bit divisive.

50
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,340
Its deliberateness puts it directly at odds with almost every other game of its type,

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,100
which strive to make actions as quick as possible and give the player tons of control and freedom.

52
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,060
However, it's for this same reason that you might find a Souls game more rewarding,

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,620
because there's a genuine sense of having earned a victory once you get it.

54
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,940
The tools you're given for victory are more limited.

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,940
You're never going to feel like a badass who can flip all over the place or dodge infinitely any time they need to.

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,260
But this makes winning with those more limited tools more satisfying and feel like a real achievement.

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,580
There is something on a core level fun about this kind of setup that you don't really get in many other types of game.

58
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,620
It also creates a much deeper appreciation for subtlety.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,060
Each Devil May Cry game, for example, has a huge array of monsters with ridiculously cool-looking moves and stuff,

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,540
but there are so many on screen at a time, and it's so easy to actually deal with them,

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,020
that there's less of a weight to an encounter.

62
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,820
The game only starts feeling fun on really high difficulties when only a couple of those attacks would kill you,

63
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,900
and you suddenly have to take everything really seriously.

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,220
Meanwhile, just this one guy in Demon's Souls could, and generally usually does, kill me.

65
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,500
I've had to put more thought into dealing with the red-eyed knights in Demon's Souls,

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,460
or the black knights in Dark Souls, than basically every enemy in a Devil May Cry game put together.

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,300
It's just that much more engaging.

68
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,980
It makes every single encounter feel dense with prediction, timing, planning, and execution.

69
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,780
You have to almost consider the psychology of your opponent to know the right time before you get there,

70
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,820
and wait out the time it takes to do the thing you wanted to do,

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,820
until you finally discover if you were accurate and everything goes as planned.

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,060
There's something beautifully orgasmic to it.

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,460
It's like cooking something difficult for yourself and sitting down and realizing you made something good,

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,820
and now it's all yours.

75
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,660
Every sliver of health you take from someone's meter was earned through this delicate interplay.

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,060
It's so good, writing about it required me to do the thing game critics should never do,

77
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,420
and start using unfitting metaphors for food and or sex.

78
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,260
This stuff is hard to do well, and it really shows in games where it's done poorly.

79
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,260
As an object lesson in bad versions of this, check out Lords of the Fallen,

80
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,100
a game that was very clearly made by people who saw that Dark Souls was popular,

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,260
and wanted to make one of those,

82
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,220
but didn't quite figure out that it actually takes a lot of effort to make this kind of game fun.

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,780
I've beaten this game all the way through twice.

84
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,220
This game is terrible.

85
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,620
Even the basic sword weapon is so slow and deliberate that it becomes a chore.

86
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
There's no light running attack at all.

87
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,020
Your guy just stops dead in his tracks.

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,140
The controls are so slow and clunky that I was sure my computer was simply too slow to run it,

89
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,300
but no, this is just how the game moves.

90
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,180
There are fast weapons, but they never escape the damage curve,

91
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,740
and you're basically either pressing the button to immediately swing,

92
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,500
but dealing very little damage,

93
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,540
or dealing more but waiting days for something to connect.

94
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,940
I'm used to a weapon having a light attack, which is quicker,

95
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,620
and a heavy attack, which is slower.

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,140
When a weapon has a slow attack and an even slower attack,

97
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,100
the entire feel of the game is broken.

98
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,660
Great swords are basically impossible to use,

99
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,580
except, for some reason, the running heavy attack comes out really fast,

100
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,900
making it essentially the fastest move in the game.

101
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,580
This one move carried me until I discovered the broken shield bash mechanic.

102
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,020
I'm actually starting to worry about the fact I beat this game twice.

103
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,700
I think that says something about me.

104
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,420
Weapons in Dark Souls are balanced so well that you don't even notice until this aspect is missing.

105
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,100
But it isn't just these central principles of control that make the series fun.

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,940
What's more interesting is how the world tests your ability to use these mechanics,

107
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,060
and thereby create the very specific feeling of adventure they do better than any other series.

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,180
Let's take, for example, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

109
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,220
Maybe you've heard of it.

110
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,420
It's a solid game.

111
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,740
However, a couple of things irked me about it.

112
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,020
One is how there's this constant need to explain itself to you.

113
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,860
Every new concept, or creature, or enemy in the game is explained to you carefully,

114
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
and in an easily digestible manner.

115
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,100
When Stalfosses? Stalfosses? Stalfies?

116
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,180
Spawn to attack you, they appear at a safe distance and then jump away.

117
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,620
When a trap is introduced, it's shown to you in a way where you immediately know

118
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,780
its entire path and what it does, and so on.

119
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,900
The game loves to tell you in straightforward ways how it works,

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,620
or what's happening, and let you deal with it how you want.

121
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,780
This is, you know, fine, and I guess it's a masterpiece that I've loved my whole life.

122
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,860
It's very fair on the player.

123
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,060
But what I don't like about fairness is how it impacts the sense

124
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,300
that you're supposed to be on an adventure.

125
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,980
Link is trying to save the world by journeying into the heart of darkness

126
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,060
and delivering the temples from evil.

127
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,420
So why are the enemies taking the time to introduce themselves?

128
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,940
And why are the traps making sure you know where they are and what they do?

129
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,020
Evil is playing fair, and always being careful to show me its weak point.

130
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,740
Nothing is ever quite surprising in Zelda.

131
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,820
Maybe, for some types of games, fairness isn't actually a good thing.

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,100
In making itself too clear about what's happening and how it works,

133
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,180
it's probably more intuitive and playable,

134
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,580
but it causes it to lack a truly great dimension

135
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,220
of feeling like you're fighting against unknowable odds

136
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,300
instead of being told them all the time.

137
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,620
Looking back, there's something really weirdly sanitized about Zelda games.

138
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,220
What makes the world of any given Souls game so much more interesting

139
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,900
is that it doesn't play fair.

140
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,980
Take, for example, Mimics in Dark Souls.

141
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,260
The only way of learning that there are enemies in the game who look like chests

142
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,740
and eat you to death if you try to open them

143
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,620
is to find one and try to open it and die.

144
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,300
This isn't bad design, though,

145
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,180
like, oh, how dare they not give me the chance to not die there.

146
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,860
It's good design.

147
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,980
Because they've, quote-unquote,

148
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,940
unfairly sacrificed the player's life that one time,

149
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,780
they've thoroughly instilled a sense of paranoia and awareness

150
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,980
and given you an even greater sense of having the odds stacked against you

151
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,460
in a horrible world full of murder and death.

152
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,380
It's not that the game is unfair to players,

153
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,260
it's that the world itself is unfair to people.

154
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,300
Life is unfair in the world of Dark Souls,

155
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,020
and you learn that the hard way by dying in it.

156
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,940
After you get eaten by one Mimic,

157
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,700
before you know it, you'll be attacking every chest you see just in case.

158
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,460
And in Dark Souls 2, you can accidentally destroy a chest if you attack it too much,

159
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,740
meaning your own paranoia can be bad for you if you employ it the wrong way.

160
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,380
It creates a more full sense of paranoia

161
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,940
and being immersed in a world that wants you dead.

162
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,020
And once you make it past a difficult area,

163
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,900
beat a hard boss,

164
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,020
or successfully predict that a chest is a Mimic and destroy it,

165
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,700
you'll feel like you've gained ground against a genuinely dangerous world.

166
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,780
The Souls games don't always play fair,

167
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,340
but that makes besting them feel all the sweeter.

168
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,180
Like a genuine victory, you know?

169
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,980
And that feeling is worth getting killed,

170
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,580
unfairly, a couple of times,

171
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,540
because it creates the sense of there being great odds to beat.

172
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,260
The feeling of triumphing against adversity is increased

173
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,780
when that adversity has already actually killed you at least once.

174
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,900
This is where the idea of the game's insane difficulty comes from.

175
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
Not the game's actual difficulty,

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,660
but the way they keep introducing you to new elements

177
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,700
by killing you with them to create a specific sense of mood.

178
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,700
The only way to know there's going to be traps in this area in Bloodborne

179
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,380
is to step on this pile of, in retrospect, really conspicuous wood,

180
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,180
hear the click,

181
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,740
and shit yourself.

182
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,180
Or if you're a badass, you can dodge it and then go about your merry way.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,420
The first time you fall for a trap, you're looking for them everywhere.

184
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,940
You've approached the whole game with a se-

185
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,980
Oh, fuck!

186
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,300
You've approached the whole game with a greater sense of awareness

187
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,220
and appreciation for its design.

188
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,900
You'll still get caught in a few traps,

189
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,340
but they'll always feel a bit like you could have done more to see them coming.

190
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,180
By the time you get to Cainhurst Castle,

191
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,980
the battlements have raised floors that look just a little bit like plates for traps,

192
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,060
so I avoided them at all costs.

193
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,860
Now, it turns out that's just what the floor looks like.

194
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,140
Any game that successfully makes you afraid of a quirky pavement

195
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,540
is unquestionably a masterpiece.

196
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,140
It's bred a sincere, visceral fear of your surroundings

197
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,900
based on how they've treated you in the past.

198
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,500
It's- it's wonderful.

199
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,980
The Souls games get into you, like, inside your head,

200
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,420
and all the gesticulating about crazy difficulty melts away

201
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,580
in the face of a fun, unforgiving,

202
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,060
but enriching series of encounters that test you

203
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,820
in ways games rarely manage to do,

204
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,740
an almost internal level.

205
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,460
You stop doing the maths about how quickly your attack goes off

206
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
and trying to figure out an opening to move,

207
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,860
and you start to just know the right time,

208
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,500
because all this stuff is so deep in your head

209
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,700
that you don't even have to think about it.

210
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,140
It becomes like an instinct.

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,220
The only experience that comes close lately is a rhythm game called Thumper.

212
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,780
It's dark, it's noisy, it's metallic.

213
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,620
It's a world of jaggedness,

214
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,820
like a journey through hell,

215
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,620
riding directly into the mouth of hell, even.

216
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,060
Like, that thing's a boss.

217
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,420
And it's very unforgiving.

218
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,700
You die in two hits, but at a certain point, you stop dying,

219
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,060
because the rhythm, the sound gets inside you.

220
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,420
The line between player and game feels like it's evaporated.

221
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,060
You begin to sense what notes are coming next,

222
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,260
because the music has got into you on an almost instinctive level.

223
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,380
You can't really sell Thumper or the Souls games

224
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,540
to someone based purely on their mechanics,

225
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,220
because the enjoyable thing about these games

226
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,820
is when all these things are so ingrained

227
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,460
that the mechanics themselves seem to fade away,

228
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,420
and you're fully transported into the salviatic nightmare

229
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,020
of sound and sight.

230
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,300
Salviatic.

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,620
I just made up a word

232
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,660
attempting to describe the feeling a game gave me.

233
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,260
Generally, generally that's a sign that something good is happening.

234
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,460
Why am I talking about Thumper, a rhythm game, here?

235
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,140
Well, you'll have to find out.

236
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,980
There's probably a reason.

237
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,100
Oh, God, is there a reason?

238
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,380
Shit, did I write that part down?

239
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,300
Oh, fuck, this page is blank.

240
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm just...

241
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm just fiddling with paper to make it sound like I wrote a script.

242
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,780
Shit, I forgot where I'm going with this.

243
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,980
And now for the reason this video was made.

244
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,700
I know, I make videos on purpose for a reason.

245
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,420
Who'd have thought?

246
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,980
Okay, so I'm pretty into the Souls series.

247
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,740
I saw lots of people playing Demon's Souls

248
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
but couldn't afford a PS3 at the time,

249
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,980
got on board with the PC version of Dark Souls—

250
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,020
yeah, that version—

251
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,140
but I really liked it,

252
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,780
and I also really like Dark Souls 2.

253
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,900
Um...

254
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,180
Okay, come on, it's—it's good.

255
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,820
It's—it's—

256
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,580
I later went back and played Demon's Souls as well

257
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,980
and very briefly delved into the precursor series,

258
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,020
King's Field, before realizing they were a bit crap and stopping.

259
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,180
Generally, I'd call myself a big fan.

260
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,980
I could talk for a long time about why the series is great.

261
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,700
In fact, I fully intend to do that right now.

262
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,500
But up until 2015, the series had a problem.

263
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,980
It's the kind of vague problem that's hard to talk about,

264
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,460
especially because I don't actually have that problem.

265
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,820
A lot of people seem not to really be able to get into them and enjoy them.

266
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,980
There's a pretty large group of people who do really like them,

267
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,060
then another group of people who pick every game up

268
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,100
but don't really get too far before getting kind of done with it,

269
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,660
and another group that probably don't really get them at all.

270
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,300
I have a sneaking suspicion that videos about Souls games

271
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,820
get super popular in the first place

272
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,540
because people watch them so they don't have to play the games

273
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,380
or to try to see why other people play something they don't get for themselves.

274
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,620
I have one friend in particular who tried all of them

275
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,220
and just didn't get them at all,

276
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,900
found them overly esoteric and difficult in a way that wasn't fun

277
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,180
and full of overly defensive, get-good, spouting fanboys

278
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,260
and just not all they were cracked up to be.

279
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,020
But then March 2015 happened.

280
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,020
Then Bloodborne happened.

281
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,260
Like the other games, my friend tried this one expecting to bounce off,

282
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,780
but instead he fell in.

283
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,300
He's played a ton of this game,

284
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,060
and I think it's one of his favorites ever,

285
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,180
at least based on how he seems to have finished it like 12 times or something.

286
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,460
But more importantly,

287
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,260
and this is the impetus behind this whole video, to be honest,

288
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,300
he went back to the other games and finally got them.

289
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,340
All of a sudden, he likes those as well.

290
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,540
And this has happened with a couple of other people too.

291
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,940
Some people just don't get the Souls games,

292
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,820
play Bloodborne,

293
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,900
and then suddenly have this deep and abiding passion for the whole series.

294
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,060
So the main purpose of this video is to try and figure out why exactly that might be.

295
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,620
Let's get down to brass tacks.

296
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,780
Let's dig a little deeper.

297
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,860
Did anyone else think The Princess and the Frog felt kind of like it was phoning it in?

298
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,540
Now I want to get into a rather heated and complex question.

299
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,940
Is it possible to play a game wrong?

300
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,180
I think this is genuinely difficult to answer.

301
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,660
People are going to have different experiences no matter what,

302
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,740
and not everyone has to like something.

303
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,820
But part of me also feels that there are right and wrong ways to approach a game.

304
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,460
But what does that mean for people who want to make good criticism

305
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,020
and attempt to analyze the rights and wrongs of game design

306
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,340
if the results are going to be so subjective anyway?

307
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,620
Does game design even matter if you can create the greatest game ever

308
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,580
but some people will just play it wrong and have a bad time?

309
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,900
Well, to a certain extent, that's always going to happen, isn't it?

310
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,100
There will always be people for whom an experience just isn't for them

311
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,740
or who are too dumb to understand how to play something

312
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,260
or don't realize that something they think is good is objectively bad.

313
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,500
Some people really like Fallout 3,

314
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,140
and they seem to be the specific type of people who think

315
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,500
clicking a dislike button is a decent way of expressing their feelings.

316
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,780
In other words, objectively stupid people like Fallout 3.

317
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,660
And there is a right way to play the Souls games.

318
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,500
You can hide behind the shield a lot,

319
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,060
die over and over trying to memorize every encounter,

320
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,420
or use magic from a distance to avoid having to engage with the game

321
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,300
or wear the heaviest armor and hope that'll save you.

322
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,580
But the reality is it's just more fun playing it as someone who dodges,

323
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,100
who weaves, who parries,

324
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,380
and who uses situational awareness to assess a situation

325
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,420
and maybe get out of it the first time without so much trial or error.

326
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,540
It's not that hard.

327
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,780
The Souls games aren't really all that difficult.

328
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,900
You dodge the attack and then you hit them with the stick.

329
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,380
Done.

330
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,780
I just solved all the Souls games for you.

331
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,660
Everything else is just pretentiousness about preparing to die.

332
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,620
I know, that's stupid.

333
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,660
Ignore all of that.

334
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,740
Oh, you think breathing fire is sexy?

335
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,820
Sorry, that's not in this semester.

336
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,540
I'm gonna have to kick you out of the school.

337
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,340
Is it rude of me to say there's right and wrong ways to have fun with a game?

338
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,900
Well, maybe.

339
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,980
But thanks to the magic of face cam,

340
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,620
I can literally see this in effect.

341
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,180
Here's Patrick Klepek painstakingly muscling his way

342
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,620
through the final boss of Demon's Souls

343
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,940
with his shield raised, a magic shield up,

344
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,100
attacking only when it's utterly safe.

345
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,580
When it's over, he breathes a sigh of relief.

346
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:51,820
He's glad it's over.

347
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,140
He's glad to be done with the game.

348
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,500
Was that fight fun?

349
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,940
It seemed torturous.

350
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,100
No wonder people think these games aren't for everyone

351
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,540
if this is how they're playing it.

352
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,340
Now, here's Patrick fighting a boss in Dark Souls 2

353
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,860
with no easy magic to help him.

354
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,300
He doesn't even have a shield.

355
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,220
He's dual-wielding maces.

356
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,140
Does he breathe a sigh of relief when it's over?

357
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,260
Well, I just came back and totally whooped the pursuer.

358
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,380
Of course not.

359
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,940
Is Dark Souls 2 such a massively more amazing experience than Demon's Souls,

360
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,420
or was he just playing it in a way that was less conducive to actually enjoying himself?

361
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,820
More importantly, what leads people to play the game one way over the other?

362
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,340
It's a difficult concept to deal with

363
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,900
because it doesn't concern the mechanics of the game itself,

364
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,460
but rather how the game relates its mechanics to the player,

365
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,820
which is far more important

366
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
and defines how the player deals with these mechanics over the course of their experience.

367
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,020
I covered this concept briefly in my Fallout 3 analysis,

368
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,900
and I realize in retrospect it was the smartest thing I said.

369
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,220
The first lockpick and hacking scenarios are immediately next to the means to circumvent them,

370
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,660
which accidentally teaches the player not to bother with these mechanics

371
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,180
because there's going to be workarounds

372
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,980
and the time or point investment is better spent elsewhere.

373
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,340
The lockpicking and hacking mechanics themselves are fine in a vacuum,

374
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,940
but you've just hamstrung the player's perception of how they surface in the game.

375
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,580
When you find the password in the dresser next to the computer,

376
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,460
you're not going to go,

377
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,900
oh boy, I can't wait to invest in my character's hacking abilities.

378
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
You think, wow, hacking is for idiots.

379
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,420
I'll just look in people's desks.

380
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,100
The lockpicking and hacking mechanics themselves were absolutely fine in my opinion.

381
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,260
They were perfectly acceptable for this kind of game,

382
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,460
but the actual experience of how they're introduced to the player

383
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,660
influences how they behave in their interactions with them,

384
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,300
and thereby alters the amount of fun they can have.

385
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,460
You play games in the manner dictated by the experience of the game itself,

386
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,460
and sometimes that manner isn't great.

387
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,540
Now, I haven't really seen anyone else writing about this psychological side of design,

388
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,740
and believe me, I've looked.

389
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,180
Even Game Feel, Stephen Swink's seminal work on good game design,

390
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,500
seems mostly concerned with making mechanics that look and feel and play well,

391
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,220
but doesn't really consider how a game causes the player

392
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,860
to start engaging with them in a way that's fun.

393
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,460
And since, from the sounds of things,

394
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,860
I'm basically the discoverer of this concept, right,

395
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,460
does that mean I get to name it?

396
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Well, uh, I'm gonna call it Play Conditioning.

397
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,420
Yeah, sure.

398
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,980
If you've got a better name or it turns out there's a large body of work

399
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,060
dealing with this concept already that I just missed,

400
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,620
let me know and I'll go mope in the corner for a while.

401
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,980
This is a little different from a more well-known concept called conveyance,

402
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,740
which is how a game tells you what its mechanics are and what things do.

403
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Play Conditioning, my new made-up term,

404
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,820
refers to how players are led to use those mechanics by how the game is executed.

405
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,780
I might just be splitting hairs to make it look like I came up with a new concept,

406
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,340
but I do feel that there's an important distinction there.

407
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,340
Let's take a look at the conditioning at play in the early levels of Demon's Souls.

408
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,060
The first boss you encounter has an unreasonably high amount of health

409
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,580
and can kill you in either one hit

410
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,620
or one and one-tenths of a hit based on your character.

411
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,100
And once he kills you, you don't get another shot.

412
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,660
You revive in the Nexus where the story properly starts.

413
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,260
But even if you do beat it,

414
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,900
you advance to this dragon and he kills you.

415
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,620
The lesson, no matter what, is you will die.

416
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,260
The game's trying to tell you that you're going to fail sometimes,

417
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,780
so you might want to learn from it.

418
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,940
It's a warning about the game's intense difficulty

419
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,700
and the nature of death in this game.

420
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,260
Embrace that it's possible and build on your mistakes.

421
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
The first time I beat the early tutorial enemies

422
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,380
and then pass through the fog door to meet this giant hulking monster

423
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,780
was genuinely kind of surprising and terrifying.

424
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,140
There's this moment of,

425
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,300
oh, shit, it's genius.

426
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,780
Your almost inevitable death at this guy's hand...

427
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,300
things

428
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,980
immediately communicates that you're going to be facing seemingly insurmountable odds,

429
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,780
which makes succeeding against them all the more satisfying.

430
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
You run into versions of this boss later in the game

431
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,420
and clowning on them after all the experience and weapons you've gained

432
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,940
is a reminder of how far you've come.

433
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,460
It's pretty good, but getting there requires playing the game for tens more hours,

434
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,380
and that's not a particularly good kind of return on your investment.

435
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,940
Plus, being killed no matter what at the start of a game

436
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,020
isn't exactly all that encouraging either.

437
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,580
It kind of has a negative effect on players, I feel.

438
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,700
Not everyone's going to enjoy being led into the game in this manner.

439
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,980
Okay, first enemy, first boss.

440
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,860
What's up, Vanguard?

441
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,700
Yo.

442
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,620
Do you think this told Patrick he should be fast and frenetic and take more risks?

443
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,180
The first real level also embodies this paradox.

444
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,020
It's a testbed for the sort of tricks and traps

445
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
that will be used against you for the rest of the game.

446
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,740
It's probably intended to teach you a lot about the game to come

447
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,220
and prime you to know what to look for and how to act.

448
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,180
This area here has a really obvious enemy just in front of you

449
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,540
that you'll be walking towards,

450
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,180
but there's a guy also hiding just behind the doorway.

451
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,340
Some games don't show you everything easily

452
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,540
because the challenge is to see if you think to look for it.

453
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,380
Countless enemies are going to hide in places

454
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,820
you can't quite see over the course of this game and its successors,

455
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,620
but after this one, you know it can happen,

456
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,100
and the real challenge is dealing with that possibility.

457
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,220
But the problem is,

458
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,060
if all of these ways of showing you the game can kill you do kill you,

459
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,980
it does feel kind of shit.

460
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,500
The game is still really, really good,

461
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,580
but it's hard to imagine a beginner who's just started a Souls game for the first time

462
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,300
opening up, dying to this section a couple of times,

463
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,980
and having a good time doing it.

464
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,740
It's possible that it accidentally imbued players with the lesson,

465
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,100
this isn't fun or fair,

466
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,900
and you should just give up or play it in the most boring possible way

467
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,180
in the hopes you survive.

468
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,540
Patrick played the game wrong

469
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,460
because he was conditioned by the experience to approach it that way.

470
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,540
I have to admit that I played Demon's Souls

471
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,780
after playing the first two Dark Souls games,

472
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,740
so these early sections weren't nearly as excruciating

473
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,860
as they would have been

474
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,380
if this was my first ever engagement with the series and its mechanics.

475
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,460
Dark Souls has this exact problem, too,

476
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
but it lessens it somewhat.

477
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,020
You start, fight easy enemies with a broken sword, no problem,

478
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,060
and then BAM!

479
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,180
Asylum Demon.

480
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,900
He's huge, and he probably kills you the first time.

481
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,180
To survive, you have to run past him and through a door to the side,

482
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,460
and then, no joke,

483
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,500
the first thing the game gives you is a shield.

484
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,740
What lesson does this instill to a player?

485
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,540
It says,

486
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,300
hide behind this to survive.

487
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,900
You loop back around and kill the demon

488
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,060
by getting the drop on it and having better weapons.

489
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,980
It's definitely improvement over the Vanguard,

490
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,380
where you get one shot, and then you're done,

491
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,260
because you immediately get the payoff of besting the opponent

492
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,420
who probably beat you at least once,

493
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,020
but by then the game's already kind of told you that shields are the way to go.

494
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,940
So it's not surprising that a lot of early players

495
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,620
run around with their shield up constantly

496
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,900
and don't really play in the kind of active, action-y way

497
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,060
that lends to really enjoying yourself.

498
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,860
You can see this play conditioning in effect with, for example,

499
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,260
Geopp, who Let's Played the game in 2012.

500
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,340
He plays very conservatively and slowly

501
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,140
and has his shield up even when nothing's around just in case.

502
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,540
He's very careful, and it takes him five videos

503
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,460
to get to the bonfire in Undead Burg.

504
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,060
And once he gets his hands on a spear,

505
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,300
he spends a huge portion of the game attacking safely from behind his shield.

506
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,740
In the description of the Let's Play,

507
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,020
he explains that he played a small bit of Demon's Souls before giving up.

508
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,700
In other words, this play style emerges

509
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,260
from when you experience the parts of the first two games

510
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,020
that seemingly condition you to play the game in the most boring way

511
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,300
in order to survive.

512
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,700
Something very telling he does is constantly discuss

513
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,060
when is a good time to heal

514
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,900
because he wants to conserve his flasks.

515
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,380
He learned to treat healing like that in Demon's Souls

516
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,540
where you could literally run out of healing items

517
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,380
and have none and just be screwed.

518
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
He takes a little while to fully take on board

519
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,540
on the instinctive level people play games

520
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,940
that wasting some of your Estus isn't a big deal

521
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,380
because it's not gone forever.

522
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,460
In other words, he's actually suffering in Dark Souls

523
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,060
because of the way Demon's Souls taught him to play this kind of game.

524
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,940
Critically, the entire Souls series, even Demon's Souls,

525
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,140
have done quite well,

526
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,620
but plenty of players didn't like Demon's Souls

527
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,300
and a few critics did agree with them.

528
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,420
Take, for example, Yahtzee,

529
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,340
everyone's favorite fast-talking English sweary man

530
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,020
who I'm not jealous of at all.

531
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,980
So in conclusion,

532
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,260
fuck you, Demon's Souls.

533
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,300
A challenge is one thing,

534
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,780
but trying to break down a fucking cement wall with your forehead

535
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,340
isn't a challenge,

536
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,260
it's grounds for getting fucking sectioned.

537
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,220
That's a pretty emphatic no to what Demon's Souls is doing,

538
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,820
I remember people on forums at the time echoing his feelings about it.

539
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,780
It's trial and error,

540
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,460
the combat is too punishing,

541
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,140
it feels overly hard,

542
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,980
you have to take it slow to do well,

543
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,580
and that just isn't fun and so on.

544
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,180
At this point, it's worth mentioning that,

545
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,420
yeah, Dark Souls did gangbusters.

546
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,460
It got super popular and had a massively committed following

547
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,340
many times the size of the one Demon's Souls ended up with,

548
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
and even Yahtzee came around on it.

549
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,700
But hang on a second.

550
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,100
Let's check out why.

551
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,860
After watching a decent let's play of the game,

552
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,980
gone over the wiki a few times,

553
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,540
and a six-week preparation with a team of advisors and physical trainers,

554
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,060
I was able to break through the wall.

555
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
And I suppose that's the first failing of Dark Souls,

556
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,300
that you need the fucking Cliff's Notes to get into it.

557
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,620
It's hard to recommend a game to someone and say,

558
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,260
but first, here's all the research you have to do.

559
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,860
Because that person's gonna say,

560
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,500
you know, you say this game's more fun than Zelda H-Bomb,

561
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,380
but Zelda doesn't require me to read any technical manuals

562
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,820
or peer-reviewed journals

563
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,380
and watch someone else play it for a few hours first.

564
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,900
This doesn't mean the game is bad.

565
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,980
Dark Souls is a very fun video game,

566
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,980
I hope that goes without saying at this point,

567
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,340
but that's a heck of a barrier for entry into that fun, isn't it?

568
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,660
I'm gonna quickly list the reasons why Dark Souls

569
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,500
does better conditioning than Demon's Souls

570
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,180
and helped onboard just enough people for it to get the popularity it did.

571
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,420
Firstly, the opening I told you about before.

572
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,100
You get killed by the Asylum Demon,

573
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,940
but you respawn just outside.

574
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,460
The rematch is immediate.

575
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,980
Instead of being killed and starting with a sense of loss and failure

576
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,500
as the beginning of the game,

577
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,540
the player is killed, but then gets to take their revenge.

578
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,300
Losing, trying again, and winning becomes the expectation

579
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,380
instead of, you know, losing.

580
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,340
Secondly, there's loads of great quality-of-life improvements.

581
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,220
Being hollow, the equivalent of a spirit in Demon's Souls,

582
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,820
no longer halves your life.

583
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,660
Demon's Souls was made much harder if you ever died and lost your human body,

584
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,500
so the player was punished for failure

585
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,940
by making it easier to fail until they get a human form back,

586
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,340
which is quite a rare occurrence in that game.

587
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,940
In Dark Souls, you have the same health

588
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,540
and you're free to not feel like you already fucked yourself by dying.

589
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,540
So, you have less to lose, so you take more risks and do better.

590
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,140
Also, the Estus Flask.

591
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,700
You had a finite amount of healing in Demon's Souls.

592
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
You either found healing items in the world

593
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,500
or bought them using souls, which were quite hard-earned.

594
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,340
Using one meant it was gone.

595
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,660
This made deciding to heal feel risky.

596
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,820
Like, if you die now, you basically wasted that healing you just used.

597
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,660
This made players less likely to heal,

598
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,700
which meant they died more, which meant they had less fun.

599
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,980
You could farm souls to buy more, but you know what isn't fun?

600
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,300
Farming items just to have enough stuff to get a proper run at the boss.

601
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,340
The Estus Flask regenerates every time you die,

602
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,860
meaning you never feel like you're actually wasting it because it'll come back.

603
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,660
This made players more willing to use their healing item,

604
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,180
which made them live longer and do better and have more fun.

605
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,100
Those were the main two, in my opinion.

606
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,260
There are more, but they're not really worth bringing up here.

607
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,740
If I were making a game with Demon's Souls as system of health,

608
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,940
I would have made your life bar and soul form your actual life bar

609
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,020
and have your health double when you were human,

610
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,260
so being human at least felt like a buff

611
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,900
instead of simply being able to use all of your health bar for a while.

612
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,460
My third reason why Dark Souls feels better is the existence of Demon's Souls itself.

613
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,780
I know it's a bit weird, but I think my reasoning is sound.

614
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,020
Demon's Souls felt to players like this weird new thing that did stuff differently,

615
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,900
and different doesn't always feel good to play.

616
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,980
Some aspects felt like active mistakes.

617
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,460
Why would they make the game this punishing and hard?

618
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,340
Why were there so many weird traps trying to directly kill me?

619
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,300
And so on.

620
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,180
Dark Souls, by being the second in a series, is viewed differently by its players.

621
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,700
Now all the weirdness and differentness and difficulty are justifiable.

622
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,620
The fact they did it twice makes it feel like, no, this is all just intentional.

623
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,260
Suddenly, bad ideas and weird concepts simply become staples of a series.

624
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,620
For a movie example, The Purge had to justify its very existence

625
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,580
and its concept to a fresh audience when it came out.

626
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,220
But The Purge 2 and 3 didn't, because they were the second and third stories in a series.

627
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,780
So even if The Purge 1 is worse than the others,

628
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,580
which, yeah...

629
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,860
It's worth keeping in mind that it did receive a different critical perspective than its sequels did.

630
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,180
Dark Souls has slightly better play conditioning,

631
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,980
but it's still quite clearly not that great at it.

632
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,780
So it isn't just that Bloodborne is a better game than the others,

633
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
although that is kinda true in my opinion,

634
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,620
Bloodborne changes people's perspectives on a more subtle level.

635
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,540
I have a theory about this ga-

636
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,100
No, I have a hypothesis about this game.

637
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,100
Bloodborne teaches you how to enjoy Souls games.

638
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,700
Let me show you just a couple of the design differences that seem small,

639
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,220
but have a massive, MASSIVE difference on the mindset of players.

640
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,740
Firstly, the most obvious one.

641
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,940
There's no shield.

642
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,380
Where is it? It's not there!

643
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,060
This isn't how these games work!

644
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,020
You don't start the game with a shield at all, no matter what.

645
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,220
This is genius!

646
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,720
This is...

647
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,300
It's a spicy meatball of game design goodness!

648
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,820
Normally food metaphors are bad,

649
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,260
but I can literally taste the design genius here.

650
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,860
The shield has been the bane of the Souls series from the very start.

651
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,460
It's the true villain,

652
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,420
and it's precisely because of its function and use.

653
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,060
Let's go back.

654
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:51,980
Ah, the shield. A classic.

655
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,660
You hold a button down and you're immediately protected from obvious harm you're facing.

656
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,940
There's a parry mechanic,

657
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,020
which you can use to make an enemy completely exposed and hit them for way more damage.

658
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,300
But why take the risk?

659
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,740
You can just block the attack,

660
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,340
and then attack when there's an opening.

661
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,060
Just wait!

662
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,180
You can do a dodge roll,

663
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,660
but you're only immune to getting hit for a few frames.

664
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,980
Why bother when you can just stand there and be fine?

665
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,340
This game's not so hard.

666
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,540
Just hold the shield button.

667
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,580
Welcome to having a shitty time.

668
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,500
The fun, frenetic dodge mechanic and the incredibly engaging parry stuff

669
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,700
is immediately foreclosed by a much safer option.

670
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,220
Not necessarily better,

671
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,380
but for early players, safer.

672
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,580
A good deal of players will spend a lot of time with their shield up,

673
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,780
playing it safe,

674
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,420
waiting for only the best possible moment to drop it,

675
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,060
strike,

676
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,500
and then bring it back up again.

677
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,820
The shields only get bigger and more defend-y.

678
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,060
They seem to actively encourage using one more rather than less over time.

679
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,620
One reason why early players gravitate towards spears

680
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,740
is because you can even use them while the shield is up.

681
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,220
It's encouraging the players to turtle up,

682
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,580
play very, very slowly,

683
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,740
and just not have a good time.

684
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,940
This is one major reason why people don't enjoy these games.

685
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,540
They tell you you're going to die a lot,

686
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,860
and then hand you a means of protecting yourself,

687
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
and the immediate assumption is that you should,

688
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,500
you know,

689
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,220
use it.

690
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,620
But it makes for boring, slow play.

691
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,220
You could try parrying,

692
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,660
or just put the shield away and have fun using the other options available to you,

693
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,260
like two-handing the sword,

694
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,220
but the game doesn't really seem to encourage doing it, does it?

695
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,620
No shield means no one is safe.

696
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,900
You have to dodge,

697
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,820
and your offhand weapon is now a gun

698
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,100
whose sole use,

699
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,260
unless you spec your character a specific way,

700
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,620
is for parrying.

701
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,260
Parry,

702
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,140
or dodge,

703
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,100
or die.

704
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,660
No easy, boring path at all.

705
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,260
You now have no choice

706
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
but to play the game the fun way.

707
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,100
Welcome to the fun zone.

708
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,500
I just, I, I can't believe it.

709
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,000
Like,

710
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,940
can you imagine being in the room

711
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,340
when Hit Attacker Miyazaki was looking at playtest footage of the previous games,

712
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,500
and coming up with the concept for Bloodborne,

713
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,220
and he was like,

714
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,940
hey,

715
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,440
hey,

716
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,940
take out the shields.

717
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,160
Like,

718
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,040
what?

719
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,460
Nani?!

720
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,500
Hit Attacker?!

721
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,740
How will people defend themselves?

722
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,180
By learning to play the game in a way that's actually fun, mate.

723
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,700
That's how Japanese people talk,

724
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,220
with that exact accent.

725
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,580
No shields, ever.

726
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,080
None.

727
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,500
Okay, one shield,

728
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,540
but it's a joke.

729
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,300
Put a joke in the arm description about them engendering passivity.

730
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,020
Passivity.

731
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,460
God, I can't do this voice.

732
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:18,940
Sorry.

733
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,980
Broad strokes, let's think about what lesson these games teach you.

734
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,140
Demon's Souls hands you a sword and shield,

735
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,420
and then kills you,

736
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,340
and tells you you're going to die a lot.

737
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,420
Dark Souls kills you,

738
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,620
and hands you a shield.

739
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,540
Bloodborne kills you,

740
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,980
and hands you a blade,

741
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,860
and a gun.

742
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,740
It's commonly said that the best defense is a good offense,

743
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,100
and while I'm currently on trial for taking that concept too seriously,

744
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,700
it's certainly true here.

745
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,620
It's just genius.

746
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,260
It's always been possible to play without a shield.

747
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,220
Two-handing a weapon,

748
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,780
or dodging,

749
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,420
or parrying,

750
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,860
has always been viable,

751
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,740
and always been more fun and fluid than using the shield,

752
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,620
but they're just harder enough compared to putting the shield up

753
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,460
that most people don't want to take the risk,

754
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,860
and thus end up playing the whole game like this.

755
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
At which point, how far you get through these games

756
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,620
becomes a question of how committed you are to being bored,

757
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,700
and there are people who've always played the games like this,

758
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,460
but they tend to have needed a long time

759
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,180
to figure out this style of play and really get into it.

760
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,460
By removing shields,

761
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,060
players are funneled into that particular play style far quicker,

762
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,580
and what's magical about this

763
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,380
is that this mindset carries over to the previous games.

764
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,580
The incredible potential of the series is made available to people

765
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,220
without the need to figure out that play style for themselves

766
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,620
by investing tons of time into an experience

767
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,780
that starts out feeling kind of plodding.

768
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,540
This is one reason why the early Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 community

769
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,700
seems so hardcore and committed,

770
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
because previously, the only sort of person

771
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,420
who would stick with early Demon's Souls or Dark Souls

772
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,060
long enough to get to the place where it's actually fun

773
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,020
is the kind of person who's willing to invest a lot of time

774
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,820
into something that starts out not all that fun,

775
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,220
and that takes a certain type of person.

776
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,580
The early fan base of the Souls series is a bunch of weirdos

777
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,340
because that's the only type of person the series could attract early on.

778
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,620
No offense intended here.

779
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm one of those people, okay?

780
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm just being self-aware.

781
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,780
Without making the experience all that much easier,

782
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,540
in fact, by making it harder by taking the shield out,

783
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,140
Bloodborne opens up the fun way of experiencing this type of game

784
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,340
to more people,

785
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,740
and that's just magical, isn't it?

786
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,620
Don't you think?

787
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,620
I'm still reeling from it, to be honest.

788
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,940
Like, what level of genius does a man have to be operating on

789
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,140
to be able to go,

790
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,580
okay, I've thought about it,

791
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,020
and by removing a key aspect of our game series,

792
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,180
we're gonna vastly improve the experience,

793
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,460
not just of this game,

794
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,380
but of all the previous ones,

795
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,540
because people will go back and play them that way

796
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,460
and have a fucking great time!

797
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,300
Like, oh my god!

798
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,980
Isn't- I- I'm sorry.

799
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,380
I try not to, like, screech too much in my videos anymore.

800
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,740
People- people say it sounds fake,

801
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,420
even though that is actually just how I talk,

802
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,740
but I just can't not.

803
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,940
It's- it's so brilliant.

804
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Woo!

805
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,860
One in, done.

806
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,140
Praise the mace.

807
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,340
Now, I don't know which Patrick you'd vote for president of the school council,

808
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,020
but I already cast my vote early.

809
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,860
I have a- a mail-in vote to the- the vidi- video game school.

810
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,700
Complementing this just genius system is rallying.

811
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,140
If you get hit, that section of lost health lingers there for a while,

812
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,020
and you get some of that health back if you hit an enemy.

813
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,980
You can theoretically get it all back almost every time.

814
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,860
This feels, at first, like a simple gimmick, right?

815
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,180
But think about how it impacts the player's sense as they play the game.

816
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,460
Now when you get hit, you don't immediately think to back off and heal

817
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,620
and just break the flow of the combat.

818
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,420
In every Souls game before that, that's the reaction.

819
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,100
Now you can keep going.

820
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,620
You can take your health back from the guy who hit you.

821
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,900
Bloody blimey!

822
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,460
Like, now you always have the option of being a little more vicious and getting away with it.

823
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,460
It's hugely impactful on the flow and action of combat.

824
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,980
Combined with the loss of shields, you're carefully encouraged into a mindset

825
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:06,940
that's just more aggressive and tactile and fun and more big, fun-sounding words.

826
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,860
It's not even a huge difference, is it?

827
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,500
But it results in an improved approach to combat that's more satisfying for players

828
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,660
and which, like not using a shield, carries back over to the previous games.

829
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,580
Bloodborne at times feels like a tutorial for how to play the previous ones

830
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,900
because even when you take rallying out,

831
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,500
killing an enemy before healing is generally a smarter option anyway.

832
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,580
You've been forced to get good the way people used to have to be obnoxious

833
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,220
and hammer away for hundreds of hours to achieve.

834
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,300
The developers of Bloodborne didn't blame players for playing it badly.

835
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,860
They blamed the game, and then they fixed it.

836
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,540
The other way players subtly influenced is the slight change in the way weapons work.

837
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,300
Quick weapons feel responsive and larger weapons feel slower and more deliberate,

838
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,980
but there's a genuine sense of weight and power when you pull them off.

839
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
But the edges have been rough at times.

840
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,540
The biggest problem has been the array of weapons available.

841
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,260
There are, in my opinion, a bit too many.

842
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,500
There's a bunch of different kinds of sword,

843
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,620
all with slightly different or majorly different animations.

844
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,140
Maces, rapiers, spears, greatswords, ultra greatswords,

845
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,780
ridiculous fuck-off big berserk reference swords,

846
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,620
battle axes, hand axes, stupid axes, and so on.

847
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,380
The variety initially seems fine,

848
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,780
but in practice it means you have to figure out and remember

849
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,260
dozens of different timings and animations and ranges

850
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,580
for both one-handing and two-handing all these weapons

851
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,940
in order to know which you prefer or which one is best for each scenario.

852
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,020
It's not particularly inviting to players,

853
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,100
and did we really need three very similar versions of the same moveset

854
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,820
when one would have had more clarity and been less cluttered?

855
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,180
Did we really need a bastard sword and a claymore?

856
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,780
Bloodborne solves this handily from, like, eight different directions at once.

857
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,980
Firstly, there's nowhere near as many weapons, but all of them are unique.

858
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,780
There are variations, like the saw cleaver has the saw spear

859
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,020
and the Kirkhammer has Ludwig's holy blade,

860
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,780
but even they feel different enough.

861
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,540
But they don't make you feel like you've lost out

862
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,940
on tons of variations you could have experimented with

863
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,100
because the weapons all have alternative forms

864
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,900
that increase the versatility of each individual weapon

865
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,980
and even give you moves that let you switch between them

866
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,900
as you're attacking, which is really cool.

867
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,300
Every weapon has an amazing amount of moves and uses,

868
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,740
but you're never overwhelmed

869
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,340
because no weapon is clearly worse or better than any other anymore.

870
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,100
I'm looking at you, sword that you get

871
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,020
that's the same moveset as a starting sword

872
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,780
but is just better for no reason.

873
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,100
There's no longer a really obviously better version

874
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,620
of the weapon you were already using

875
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,140
you now have to switch to later on because it's underleveled.

876
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,780
But overall, these changes gently coax players

877
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,180
into feeling like the choice they made is valid

878
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,620
instead of living in constant fear that they're hamstringing themselves.

879
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,020
The saw cleaver can be your endgame weapon,

880
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,340
and you can become intimately knowledgeable with its use

881
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,300
and never have to worry if you should actually be using something else

882
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,380
and the weapons are unique and varied enough

883
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,500
that they never feel samey even if you use them for the whole game.

884
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,140
If you really like generic swords, there's one in there.

885
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,860
It just happens to be able to turn into a cool weapon.

886
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,060
The downsides of each weapon are almost always clear and understandable.

887
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,620
You know, the Kirkhammer's huge but a bit slow.

888
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,300
The sword cane is really quick and has a whip state that has a huge range

889
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,140
but it doesn't deal all that much damage.

890
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,500
Okay, there is one thing.

891
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,740
The Tornatrus is weird.

892
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,100
It's actually my favorite weapon.

893
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,180
Its alternate form is it doesn't have one.

894
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,180
It just becomes briefly electric.

895
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,100
It's generally pretty strong and fast

896
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,860
and knowing when to take the time to electrify it for even more damage is great.

897
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,780
Its downside is really silly though.

898
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,140
It has a low durability and it goes down quicker than normal weapons

899
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,820
meaning you have to repair it more often

900
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,300
by returning to the hunter's dream and fixing it up.

901
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,300
But it doesn't deteriorate that quickly and repairing costs next to nothing.

902
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,660
It's at worst a hassle.

903
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,500
That's not really much of a downside.

904
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,540
I get that it's trying to make it a weapon you have to use sparingly.

905
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,900
I think that's a neat idea.

906
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,660
But in practice, it doesn't lose durability fast enough to be a major issue

907
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,460
and it's annoying to go to fix when it does get low.

908
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,860
Dark Souls 2 actually had a better system

909
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,500
where resting at a bonfire restored your weapons each time

910
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,340
and durability was lower all round.

911
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,740
So you really did have to take that into consideration

912
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,500
and some weapons really could only be used sparingly during a single run.

913
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,220
Instead of with the Tornatrus, which is basically a really good weapon,

914
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,140
you have to repair a bit more than usual,

915
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,460
which is just not a huge downside.

916
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,820
I think this would have been even better

917
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,660
if they'd ripped off Dark Souls 2 a little more

918
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,700
and had durability that comes back when you die every time

919
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,140
but goes down even faster

920
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,980
so you really did have to pick the times

921
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,860
to pull out the Funtime Electric murder death stick.

922
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,180
I think maybe the over-the-top dislike some fans exhibited towards Dark Souls 2

923
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,700
caused the developers to walk back on ideas that were genuinely better.

924
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,380
Okay, I—I—I—I—

925
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,660
I could spend a good deal of this video defending Dark Souls 2.

926
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:41,180
In fact, um, I—like half of the script is me doing that

927
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,220
but I do have some sense of when a video is getting to be too much

928
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,900
so I've cut all those bits out

929
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,420
and I'm gonna compile a video looking at the central complaints about it

930
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,740
and why all of them are wrong and lies from criminals

931
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,860
and I'm gonna put that up in a separate video a bit later on.

932
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,780
When that comes up, I'll put the link here.

933
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,980
So, okay, cool.

934
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,980
Back to Bloodborne.

935
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,620
While I have already talked about how great the weapons

936
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,940
have always generally felt in Souls games,

937
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,420
a couple of attacks and moves still felt just a little bit like traps.

938
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,140
Moves you really should not use under any circumstances

939
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,620
because you'll never be in a position where they're actually useful

940
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,900
or they're just ridiculous.

941
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,340
Especially with the larger weapons

942
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,140
and the second or third moves of their heavier attack strings.

943
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,820
The second heavy swing of the two-handed dark blade is a honeypot,

944
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,180
a sexy, powerful trap designed to bait you into being killed

945
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,100
for attempting to actually use it.

946
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,740
Almost every weapon has multiple swings for its R2

947
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,940
even if it shouldn't

948
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,580
because how often is that attack gonna get the chance to go off in this action game?

949
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,700
Giving players that option will cause them to try and use it

950
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,740
and suffer the consequences in a way that doesn't really feel fun.

951
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,180
Giving the players the option to do this is inviting them to get killed.

952
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,580
Bloodborne makes a lot of subtle changes here.

953
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,940
Firstly, the R2 is no longer an attack with second or third swings.

954
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,340
It's very definitively just a single move.

955
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,100
It takes away the inherent tension of not knowing if you should be mashing R1

956
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,540
or doing the strong but slower ones and seeing how many you can get in.

957
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,660
It makes it immediately intuitive that you should be doing the quicker attacks

958
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,180
and finishing with the strong one

959
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,300
or using it when you know a great place for its particular timing.

960
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,020
This moveset is slightly more limited than the previous games

961
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,060
but in a way that's good

962
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,900
because it means players aren't getting bogged down

963
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,660
by moves that are actually useless

964
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,180
but beg you to keep using them because you technically can use them.

965
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,100
So even though you can only do one,

966
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,220
if you're given a big window,

967
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,940
you can still maximize damage with it by charging it up.

968
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,580
However, quick weapons or weapons with different properties

969
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,260
aren't hamstrung by this.

970
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,740
The whip function of the sword cane doesn't charge

971
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,740
and can combo into a second move

972
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,420
because as a relatively quick weapon,

973
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,580
the idea of doing more than one attack with it

974
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,940
isn't inherently a trap.

975
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,300
A cute extra thing I've noticed

976
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,060
is that with the really heavy weapon,

977
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,580
there is a second R2.

978
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,820
If you fully charge Ludwig's Holy Blade,

979
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,220
there's a second attack that can come out after

980
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
but only if you fully charged it.

981
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,900
I like this move because it's an acknowledgement

982
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,780
that if you're in a position

983
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,820
where you just fully charged a very slow and deliberate attack

984
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,500
and you did just hit someone with it,

985
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,780
you're probably in a position

986
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,380
where you might as well have access

987
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,300
to another slow but powerful move.

988
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,260
To my recollection,

989
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,260
this is the only weapon with this property.

990
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,380
It's really cool.

991
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,620
The fully charged R2 is so strong already

992
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,420
that it also usually staggers whoever was coming for you.

993
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,580
So that second attack is basically a reward

994
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,300
for mastering one of the most careful moves in the game.

995
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,700
It's also worth mentioning that the weapon upgrade system

996
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,540
is no longer a horrifying nightmare

997
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,660
where you can make a weapon into a crushing weapon

998
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,140
or a fire weapon or poison or magic

999
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,340
or an enchanted weapon.

1000
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,060
Yes, those are both different things in the same game.

1001
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,660
Or a crystal weapon?

1002
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,300
Or a mundane weapon?

1003
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,460
A dark weapon?

1004
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,660
Half of these options will actively ruin your weapon

1005
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,900
unless you've built your character a certain way,

1006
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,780
and the resources you expend doing this are rare enough

1007
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,700
that you can't afford to waste them.

1008
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,820
I get nervous whenever I'm at a weapon upgrade screen

1009
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,860
in a Souls game, and that's maybe not great.

1010
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,780
Bloodborne keeps the straightforward aspects

1011
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,580
of the upgrade path.

1012
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,740
You spend blood echoes and bloodstone shards

1013
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,620
to make your weapon just generally better and bloodier.

1014
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,780
But there are also gems that you can put on a weapon

1015
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,980
to change its properties,

1016
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,820
but they explain what they do in simple,

1017
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,340
easy-to-understand ways,

1018
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,020
and they can just be taken out.

1019
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,780
So experimentation with weapons

1020
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,020
is actively encouraged for once.

1021
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,540
This relatively simple change

1022
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,100
makes the whole game feel a lot more inviting.

1023
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,820
You know you aren't going to render a weapon unusable

1024
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,540
or waste one of the two or three magic stone upgrade things

1025
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,140
you'll get in the space of playing,

1026
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,860
and that makes you more willing to experiment and mess about,

1027
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,220
and that just—it just feels better in a big way.

1028
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,700
On top of this, the designs of the enemies you fight

1029
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,060
have themselves been altered

1030
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,540
to force you to play the game in a more fun manner.

1031
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,900
Here are some of the generic enemies

1032
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,940
from the previous games.

1033
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,500
They like to attack a very specific, simple way.

1034
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,380
They walk up to you,

1035
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,700
and then they engage a rather simple attack.

1036
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
More importantly, when they're done approaching you,

1037
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,300
they kind of stop moving.

1038
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,820
Dodging backwards is an effective way

1039
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,700
to get out of their range

1040
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,620
and free up some time and distance.

1041
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,700
Lots of bosses behave like this as well.

1042
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,380
Get out of their range while they're attacking you,

1043
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
and you're in a safe zone of sorts.

1044
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,980
Fast forward to Bloodborne.

1045
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,580
Most enemies move very differently

1046
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,660
in an arguably more realistic manner.

1047
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,500
When even early enemies attack,

1048
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,260
they continue moving forward,

1049
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,860
stumble ahead and stuff.

1050
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,940
Dodging backwards as early as the main area

1051
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,300
is a recipe for danger.

1052
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,580
The game immediately tells you

1053
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,700
that you have to think harder

1054
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,460
about how you're dealing with these attacks.

1055
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,460
The second boss most people encounter,

1056
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,260
Gascoigne, is intensely good at this.

1057
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,540
Both versions of this fight,

1058
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,100
both before and after he transforms into a monster,

1059
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,620
have attacks where dodging backwards

1060
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,780
leaves you primed to be attacked again.

1061
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,660
In monster form,

1062
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,540
almost all of his attacks launch him further forward.

1063
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,220
The only way to succeed against this guy

1064
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,580
is to get good at parrying him

1065
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,340
or learn to dodge to the side

1066
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,740
or even forward through his attacks

1067
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,340
with your momentary invincibility

1068
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,860
to get in a strike of your own.

1069
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,620
Or you could keep trying to dodge backwards

1070
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,780
and complain that the game doesn't let you escape.

1071
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,300
My first few attempts at Gascoigne

1072
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,540
were the least fun I'd had in the series

1073
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,460
because, as someone who regards themselves

1074
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,820
as a seasoned Souls player

1075
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,060
where dodging backwards was how I survived,

1076
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,540
this was the first major stumbling block of the game.

1077
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,380
It forced me to unlearn a style of play

1078
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,420
that was, in retrospect,

1079
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,780
conservative and uninteresting

1080
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,620
and honestly was worth forgetting.

1081
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,660
By the time of the attempts

1082
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,780
where I was close to winning,

1083
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,740
I was having more fun

1084
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,900
than any other encounter in previous games

1085
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,820
because the way I played was more engaging

1086
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,420
and felt faster and more fluid.

1087
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,900
I was choosing not to try to escape a skirmish

1088
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,980
because the enemy wouldn't let me do it so easily.

1089
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,340
Instead, I was staying close

1090
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,620
and getting in my own hits

1091
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,220
and ignoring when I was taking damage

1092
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,420
because I knew I would get it back

1093
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,820
just by continuing the fight and hitting them.

1094
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,380
Defeating Gascoigne is a genuine victory,

1095
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,500
and once you've done so,

1096
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,900
you've proven that you're capable of approaching battle

1097
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,540
in a way that's actually fun and quick and fast.

1098
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,540
You can't hang back and shoot spells at him

1099
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,300
and just not learn anything the whole game

1100
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,820
and be generally bored.

1101
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,940
You have to, well, learn to play the game

1102
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,180
the way many people have always played these games,

1103
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,860
but which doesn't come naturally.

1104
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,380
I could stop right here.

1105
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,220
You can already see the point, can't you?

1106
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,500
When you pick up Bloodborne,

1107
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,540
the first couple of hours

1108
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,820
of using these altered mechanics

1109
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,260
and mastering them train you

1110
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,860
to play not just Bloodborne,

1111
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,380
but any game in the series

1112
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,060
in a manner that's actually fun.

1113
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,060
After years of hitchhiking,

1114
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,180
normal people have finally been handed the keys

1115
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,620
to the Souls games,

1116
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,140
and that's a really good thing

1117
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,820
because these games are good.

1118
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,940
They just previously never quite showed people

1119
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,820
why they were good

1120
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,140
or how to play them in a way that felt good.

1121
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,300
I feel that this is why my friend liked it more

1122
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,220
and then went back and liked the rest,

1123
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,900
why people who couldn't get into any of them

1124
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,100
could get into this one

1125
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,140
at least a little more

1126
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,060
even if it still wasn't really their thing.

1127
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,580
In his review of Bloodborne,

1128
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,860
Yahtzee says this.

1129
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,020
"...from software who have been doing one specific thing

1130
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,220
for about four games now.

1131
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,580
Fortunately, it's a thing I'm into

1132
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,540
because I like explorative

1133
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,820
metroidvania-style gameplay,

1134
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,020
I like subtle storytelling,

1135
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,460
I like banging my head against a wall

1136
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,820
with a scary monster drawn on it."

1137
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,340
Trying to break down a fucking cement wall

1138
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,620
with your forehead isn't a challenge,

1139
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,460
it's grounds for getting fucking sectioned.

1140
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,980
"...from Demon's Souls to Dark Souls

1141
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,580
to Dark Souls 2 to Bloodborne.

1142
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,940
Same shit, different anus."

1143
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,220
Dark Souls 2 is the third game

1144
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,060
in a series that began with Demon's Souls,

1145
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,180
which I was thinking I should go back

1146
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,140
and try again sometime.

1147
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,900
Ooh, maybe you should have given Demon's Souls

1148
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,540
a proper shot.

1149
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,780
What a fantastic idea, you piece of shit.

1150
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,780
I'm not actually criticising Yahtzee here,

1151
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,980
although I guess I kind of am

1152
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,340
because he didn't give Demon's Souls

1153
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,380
a fair shot in the first place.

1154
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,900
I'm using his transition to show how

1155
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,260
this is just how perception of a game

1156
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,140
can change over time

1157
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,500
when it gets iterated upon.

1158
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,980
This transition and why it happened is valuable.

1159
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,660
Yahtzee's gone from hating Demon's Souls

1160
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,260
and thinking it's trial-and-error bullshit

1161
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,060
that isn't fun,

1162
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,700
to claiming it's part of a series he really likes

1163
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,020
and which, in his opinion, are all very similar.

1164
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,100
Good play conditioning can cause a player

1165
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,340
to suddenly want to commit

1166
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,820
to an experience superficially very similar

1167
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,980
to the one they previously really didn't.

1168
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,900
This is why Bloodborne is amazing.

1169
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,980
It's trained people to engage the game

1170
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,860
in a way that makes the experience worth having.

1171
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,700
Some games can be a good experience,

1172
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,180
but not very good at bringing people into it.

1173
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,300
Isn't it somewhat possible

1174
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,820
that there are many great games

1175
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,180
that slip through the cracks

1176
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,260
simply because they didn't fully prep the player

1177
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,020
to properly play and enjoy them?

1178
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,020
Maybe there's a right way to play every game.

1179
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,740
At the very least,

1180
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,420
there's a right way to play a Souls game,

1181
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,740
and Bloodborne finally teaches players

1182
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,380
what that way is in a straightforward manner.

1183
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,580
Okay, gonna be honest,

1184
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,860
that's my core argument.

1185
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,020
I think I just summarised it in about 40 minutes,

1186
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,220
which, all things considered,

1187
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,980
is pretty short for me.

1188
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,740
But while I'm here talking about Bloodborne,

1189
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,020
I might as well summarise

1190
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,580
the less condition-y reasons why it's so great

1191
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
and get more into the general reasons.

1192
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,500
Let's talk about the rest of the stuff.

1193
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,900
The Souls games in general, except for two,

1194
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,420
have this tendency to not really

1195
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,660
have an interesting story to me personally.

1196
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,380
They're like,

1197
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,740
oh, you have to stop the king.

1198
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,140
He went bad and or mad.

1199
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,220
All the characters you meet are mostly hangers-on

1200
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,620
who are also messing about in this doomed world.

1201
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,900
They tend to be interesting,

1202
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,820
but I could honestly take them or leave them.

1203
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,420
The story's extra wrinkles feel like

1204
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,820
they don't really add any value to the experience itself

1205
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,580
and are more just interesting stuff

1206
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,100
you can write wikis about later.

1207
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
There's an overall sense that all the fun stuff

1208
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,180
in the story has already happened,

1209
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,940
and while it was probably interesting

1210
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,380
and it's cool to find out about,

1211
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,860
the player is essentially given a walking tour of a world

1212
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,100
where all the cool stuff has already happened.

1213
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,580
All the major players in the story are either dead

1214
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,140
or hanging out waiting to be killed by you.

1215
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,340
Bloodborne is interesting

1216
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,500
because you're not on any singular quest.

1217
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,380
No one tells you to kill a bunch of people to do this stuff.

1218
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,580
The game even makes a joke

1219
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,420
about how unnecessary the story is,

1220
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,300
but the dude's unwillingness to share the truth with you

1221
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,500
is actually a clever setup

1222
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,700
for how this guy is maybe himself not super trustworthy.

1223
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,500
The story is happening at you instead of in the past.

1224
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,020
You're actively trying to uncover

1225
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,620
what's happening as you play,

1226
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,620
not because it might be interesting

1227
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,300
to find out about in general,

1228
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,980
but to have a grip on what's happening

1229
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,940
and what result my actions are having on the world.

1230
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,940
There's a real sense of time passing

1231
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,140
over the course of the game

1232
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,340
as the night progresses

1233
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,940
and the people locked in their houses

1234
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,540
get more worried or sicker

1235
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,180
or begin to transform into monsters themselves.

1236
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,540
There's this game called Ocarina of Zelda Legend of Ti-

1237
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,340
Wait.

1238
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,140
There's this game called Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

1239
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,180
and in it, there's this place called Hyrule Castle Town.

1240
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,260
It's a small and simple area,

1241
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,620
especially by modern standards,

1242
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,260
but there's so much character and life to it.

1243
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,020
Even for an N64 game,

1244
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,500
there are cool stores and side quests

1245
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,820
and just people hanging out having a good time

1246
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,780
and that music.

1247
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,820
It feels like a place full of life.

1248
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,500
One thing games like Dark Souls lack

1249
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,820
is this idea that there's even a world

1250
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
worth fighting for somewhere.

1251
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,180
The entire world of the games are empty nightmares

1252
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,180
populated only by the dying,

1253
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,060
the dead,

1254
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,180
the undead,

1255
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,140
the mad,

1256
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,860
the sad,

1257
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,900
the monstrous,

1258
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,980
and Scottish people.

1259
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,860
Link is being told he's supposed to help Zelda save the world

1260
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,540
and he is a world worth saving.

1261
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,380
Hyrule Castle Town stuck with me,

1262
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,620
mainly because when you pull out the Master Sword

1263
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,100
and time advances and you go outside...

1264
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,620
It's become this horrible place.

1265
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,060
Only three things in this era of gaming

1266
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,100
ever gave me genuine chills of fear.

1267
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,340
The terrifying werewolf monster thing

1268
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,380
that attacks you out of nowhere in Castlevania 64,

1269
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,940
the landmine with eyes in Banjo-Kazooie,

1270
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,180
which legitimately scared me a lot as a kid,

1271
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,500
and coming out of the Temple of Time

1272
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,580
to discover that the lovely, happy town

1273
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,900
had been reduced to this.

1274
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,740
It shocked my tiny mind,

1275
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,500
seeing it just change like that.

1276
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,700
That ability to imbue a sense in a player about a place

1277
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,820
is really important, I think.

1278
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,340
Now, Bloodborne doesn't have a section

1279
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,780
where you see what the town was like

1280
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,140
when things were nice,

1281
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,940
but by starting just a little bit off-kilter,

1282
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,260
just a little bit covered in monsters,

1283
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,660
you see that there is something worth saving in there,

1284
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,580
and as those things start to disappear

1285
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,580
and things take a Lovecraftian turn,

1286
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,140
there's that same sense of loss

1287
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,900
that things have gotten so much worse.

1288
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,180
And I love Lovecraft.

1289
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,340
He was my favorite author when I was 14

1290
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,980
until I noticed that no one was actually impressed

1291
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,540
when I would say sanguine instead of red.

1292
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,940
In retrospect, he's not as great a writer as I remember,

1293
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,380
and he's kind of one-note,

1294
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,980
but his writing has inspired a wealth

1295
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,380
of fantastic designs and stories over the years

1296
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,540
that take liberties the way he didn't

1297
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,180
and maintain the same sense of terror at the unknown

1298
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,420
while having other less-secretly-super-racist stuff in there, too.

1299
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,980
And Bloodborne is one of those fantastic stories.

1300
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,140
It has a sense of cosmic terror

1301
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,900
that only appears in the third act,

1302
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,060
but when it comes, it comes in a big way,

1303
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,620
making it super surprising and harder-hitting

1304
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,540
than it would have been if it had started out that way

1305
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,460
or been super predictable about it.

1306
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,980
Oh, it's horrible.

1307
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,420
Birth imagery. I hate it.

1308
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,220
The world design is great as well.

1309
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,900
Okay, Dark Souls.

1310
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,100
Interconnected world.

1311
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,500
Lots of alternate paths and secret ways into other areas.

1312
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,180
It's great.

1313
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,940
But you know what sucks?

1314
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,780
Backtracking all the way across it again

1315
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,340
because you died and there's no bonfire anywhere near it.

1316
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,340
Too much time is spent walking back and forth

1317
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,020
through areas you've already visited,

1318
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
and the world never really changes,

1319
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,260
so you're seeing the same area over and over,

1320
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,500
except sometimes you're seeing it backwards.

1321
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,860
I know the entirety of Dark Souls' world like the back of my hand.

1322
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,260
That's not because it's super memorable or interesting,

1323
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,820
but because I had to walk through all of it a lot

1324
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,860
to get to newer places or because I died again.

1325
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,500
Demon's Souls, in my opinion, was actually better.

1326
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
There's basically no backtracking.

1327
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,940
There's no interconnectedness either.

1328
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,860
Each archstone takes you to a different area,

1329
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,500
and you go in a linear path to the end and then leave.

1330
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,020
It doesn't have pretensions of being interconnected or one big world

1331
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,420
and instead focuses on making levels that are interesting

1332
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,900
and engaging to play through the very first time.

1333
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,220
Demon's Souls is a little bit harder than Dark Souls

1334
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,700
because the creators of Dark Souls at some point realized

1335
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,460
that people would be fighting through each level

1336
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,300
several times forwards and backwards

1337
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,620
and eventually people would just want to run past most of it

1338
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,380
to get where they were trying to go.

1339
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,140
So they designed areas where running away tended to work out pretty good.

1340
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,300
Demon's Souls is almost hard-coded to destroy you if you try that shit.

1341
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,220
But the trade-off is the encounter itself is more challenging and rewarding

1342
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,580
because it's designed to be approached once from one particular direction.

1343
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,380
I will take good level design over an open feeling world

1344
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,300
I'll have to backtrack through constantly every single time.

1345
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,900
The best areas in Dark Souls, Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo,

1346
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,900
don't really interconnect with anywhere

1347
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,380
and instead they're mostly a straight shot from where you start to meeting the boss.

1348
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,620
It's the best area precisely because,

1349
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,260
since the developers only intend for you to fight all the way through it

1350
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,940
once in one direction,

1351
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:29,180
it feeds you encounters precisely primed to challenge you in a specific way

1352
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,460
instead of having to be designed

1353
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,180
so you could come through in any direction to go somewhere else

1354
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,580
which loosens what you can really do.

1355
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,820
Anor Londo feels a bit like a remake of some sections of the Boletarian Palace

1356
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,460
and I wish more sections were willing to be more linear

1357
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,860
and just be more interesting that first time.

1358
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,780
Fighting your way back out of Blighttown

1359
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,500
or running all the way back through the door Havel's guarding

1360
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,660
just to get to the Darkroot Basin is annoying

1361
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,340
and just generally uninteresting.

1362
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,580
Especially when it's for the eighth time.

1363
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,620
I'm still in a dream...

1364
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,420
Dark Soul...

1365
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,500
Darkroot Basin in general feels kind of dumb.

1366
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,140
It's just a big area mostly empty of stuff to deal with

1367
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,620
with some kind of simplistic enemies dropped there.

1368
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,660
If I wanted to have a bad time running through a mostly empty world

1369
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,420
I would just play Monster Hunter.

1370
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,140
The Darkroot Basin also has the most dumb boss in the game

1371
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,300
who has two attacks they do over and over

1372
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,780
and which basically miss even if you're standing still.

1373
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,940
Bloodborne combines both of the best elements of each game.

1374
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,380
It's never got any areas that are too open and have nothing in them.

1375
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,940
Even areas taking place in the forest are dense

1376
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,180
with well-made and challenging encounters

1377
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,500
and let's not forget actual traps

1378
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,580
that seem like they were laid out for a person.

1379
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,060
Jesus! No! No!

1380
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:50,540
Oh, I saw it just as I stepped on it.

1381
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,100
Backtracking is reduced because there are more lanterns

1382
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,780
and while areas are interconnected

1383
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,580
many sections are essentially straight shots to the next area

1384
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,660
with short side paths containing items.

1385
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,460
So you have a big open world that feels interconnected

1386
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,780
but surprising amounts of linearity.

1387
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,020
So you can have areas like this that only work

1388
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,780
if you're approaching from one direction

1389
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,260
so all these enemies are actually waiting and hiding for you

1390
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,300
and shoot at you.

1391
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,220
Coming back through this area would be weird

1392
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,060
but you never have to think about that

1393
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,420
because you never have to.

1394
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,340
You can teleport around easily.

1395
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,660
There's quite a delicate sense of linearity

1396
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,900
and traveling across areas you've already visited

1397
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,180
because you have a key or some new thing has been unlocked by your actions

1398
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,980
and thanks to a mechanic I'm going to call the knight

1399
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,460
where an actual story progresses as you kill bosses

1400
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,180
and the effects of your growing pool of insight too.

1401
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,980
Even pre-visited areas are a little bit different

1402
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,900
either visually or otherwise.

1403
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,620
Enemies change around, get glowy scary scythes

1404
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,900
and red versions of sticks

1405
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,500
or just go to sleep.

1406
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,660
So the experience of going back through Cathedral Ward

1407
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,260
to go to a new area is valuable

1408
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,540
because it's changing and you're seeing things being different.

1409
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,180
You're not just revisiting it or going through it again

1410
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,500
but backwards to get to the next new area.

1411
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,900
Okay, also co-op isn't garbage anymore.

1412
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,780
Trying to summon friends in these games has always been super annoying.

1413
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,460
You have to hope you're on the same server

1414
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,700
or the servers are even up anymore.

1415
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,940
You have to go human or consumer humanity

1416
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,860
and sit at the bonfire and go human

1417
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
and hope you see their summon sign

1418
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,300
and then maybe you'll summon someone to help with Ornstein and...

1419
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,300
Smeg.

1420
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,620
But as you can tell from this footage it didn't work

1421
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,300
and I died on the way to summon Solaire

1422
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,220
and I didn't have any humanity left to try it again

1423
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,580
so I had to do it myself

1424
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,900
and by do it myself I mean get fucked.

1425
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,260
Also being human makes it so you can be invaded by other players.

1426
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,540
You know what sucks?

1427
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,140
That becoming human,

1428
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:42,300
the thing you do if you need help with something you're having trouble with

1429
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,060
is also the thing that invites in more people to gank you to death.

1430
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,740
Like, no thanks.

1431
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,860
I can see the idea of it being cool and risk-reward

1432
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,300
but it's actually shit

1433
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,740
because it means you can be invaded

1434
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,620
before you even get to find someone you can summon

1435
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,580
and if I'm summoning at all I'm already having trouble.

1436
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,020
Bloodborne's co-op feels like it was actually made by people

1437
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,060
who assumed other people might want to use it.

1438
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,780
There's no human or inhuman state anymore.

1439
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,540
Instead, if you need a hand, you ring the please help me bell.

1440
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,180
Uh, in Britain we're actually all given one of those at birth.

1441
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,700
And if someone else is ringing the help people bell

1442
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,540
they're pulled in to give you a hand.

1443
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,900
It's simple and you don't have to mess about looking for signs anymore.

1444
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,300
Only after summoning can you get invaded

1445
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,620
so you have someone helping you with the area you're obviously finding difficult

1446
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,620
and the new person coming to get you

1447
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,700
at least definitely has to deal with two of you

1448
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,380
which seems a bit more fair.

1449
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,300
And if you want to co-op with a specific person

1450
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,020
you can both enter a password of your choosing and go.

1451
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,980
Also, insight seems to be a less rare resource

1452
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,500
than all the others in previous games

1453
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,500
so it's less likely you're gonna run out of your ability to ask for help

1454
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,940
which is a really good idea.

1455
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,780
Oh, and since insight is tied to certain enemies getting harder

1456
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,100
if you need a lot of help you're lowering it

1457
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,260
so things will eventually let up.

1458
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,100
Not much, but it's nice.

1459
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,380
It's really nice.

1460
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,580
Also, the sound design.

1461
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,660
It's just brilliant.

1462
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,220
Everything.

1463
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,340
The monster howls.

1464
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,780
The trick weapons clicky-clacking into their alternate forms.

1465
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,660
The thunderous pounding of the machine gun.

1466
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,180
The squelching of the monsters getting slit up by me.

1467
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,460
The extra diegetic

1468
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,740
that plays when you parry someone successfully.

1469
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,060
The squeal of the tonitrus as it comes alive and thirsts for crime.

1470
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,260
It's all great.

1471
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,140
I hope the sound designers get to write a book about the work they did

1472
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,380
making this game feel so great.

1473
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,380
And in 10 years, once I know enough Japanese

1474
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,620
to be able to comprehend basic sentences

1475
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,140
I'll even be able to read it.

1476
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,940
The key thing that proves the power of the sound in this game

1477
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,820
is that these crow enemies are like regular-looking crows

1478
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,100
if a bit oversized.

1479
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,820
They attack by fluttering at you with their wings.

1480
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,580
But they do this when they attack you.

1481
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,660
These crows are a nightmare.

1482
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,340
They hide in just the right places

1483
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,820
and they make just a loud and horrifying enough noise

1484
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,180
that it never feels like they're an easy enemy to deal with.

1485
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,340
They're always just scary.

1486
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,620
They even come close to the fucking landmine.

1487
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,620
Fucking Jesus Christ.

1488
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,820
It's just great stuff.

1489
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,420
There's a section in Yahoo! Ghoul where I just had to stop and listen.

1490
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,260
There's ominous, distant, pseudo-diegetic chanting,

1491
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,700
vague screams and cries in the distance.

1492
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,980
It's really quite something.

1493
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,900
I don't like describing games as atmospheric

1494
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,060
or dripping with atmosphere or anything like that.

1495
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,420
That feels kind of like a cop-out.

1496
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:38,460
But even attempting to describe the feeling of standing still in an area

1497
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,100
has caused me to slip into this really subdued tone.

1498
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,020
To me at least, that says something about the game's ability to communicate.

1499
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,540
It says something about the game's command and attitude.

1500
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,700
Also, because I'm standing in an area where I just cleaned out a bunch of enemies,

1501
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,020
ghosts keep appearing and shooting in my direction

1502
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,500
because they're still fighting them, and I think that's kind of funny.

1503
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,860
Okay, finally, the big monster boss fights.

1504
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,660
Souls games are bad at these, in my opinion.

1505
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,460
I get it, a lot of people like the Gaping Dragon and think he's cool

1506
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,460
and there's a, you know, they're interesting-looking.

1507
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:13,020
But in my opinion, they're not that great to fight, which is the important bit.

1508
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,860
I often refer to as the dudes-in-armor argument

1509
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:19,100
that Souls games feature too many enemies that are just dudes in armor.

1510
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,940
But in fights, monsters and the big, cool, weird enemies

1511
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,540
don't react in a manner that makes sense to me as a player.

1512
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,020
Human enemies respond when you hit them with your sword,

1513
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:33,020
but Sif, for example, doesn't seem to even flinch most of the time.

1514
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,420
Even the final boss flinches when you hit him, so you at least know it's working.

1515
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,660
I am making some of the mightiest swings you can possibly imagine right now

1516
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,620
using my character, who incidentally I named Brexit,

1517
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,700
and she's like, eh, whatever.

1518
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,860
I'm gonna continue moving like it's a normal thing.

1519
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:52,380
No selling all my best moves, just like all the other women in my life.

1520
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,380
Even Sif is negging me.

1521
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,740
And suddenly she's limping.

1522
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,340
I mean, oh, it's so sad.

1523
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,420
Oh, it's a sad dog, etc.

1524
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,900
But where was this kind of reacting before?

1525
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:05,260
And you can't parry monstery enemies of any kind either.

1526
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,060
It took me major trial and error for me to even determine

1527
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,100
if you could parry the Snake Men in Sen's Fortress.

1528
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,380
By the way, the answer is yes, but only some attacks.

1529
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,740
The Dark Souls wiki even has an extensive list of what creatures you actually can parry

1530
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,500
and what attacks you can parry.

1531
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,460
I get that not everything you're fighting is technically humanoid

1532
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,300
or has a weapon that you can parry in a traditional sense,

1533
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,100
but it still feels really lacking in my opinion

1534
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,980
that you can't use one of the most interesting mechanics in the game

1535
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,820
against, like, half the enemies.

1536
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,300
You can kind of parry monsters' attacks.

1537
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,140
It causes them to do a bit less damage,

1538
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,820
but seriously, what the fuck?

1539
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,500
If you have a pseudo parry mechanic,

1540
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,100
just let me fucking parry this guy.

1541
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:45,980
Jesus.

1542
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,460
The timing is often incredibly hard.

1543
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:51,500
Like, literally harder than putting your shield up or dodging,

1544
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,780
and all it does is cause you to take reduced damage?

1545
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,620
Like, what?

1546
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,260
Bloodborne finally sorts that shit out.

1547
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,300
It makes monstrous enemies react better to being attacked,

1548
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,780
even bosses, where you can suddenly do cool things

1549
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,860
like break individual limbs.

1550
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,500
When you finally topple Dark Beast Pal to the ground

1551
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,820
because you knocked him so completely off balance,

1552
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,140
there's a real sense that you've gained an upper hand

1553
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:17,020
and rattled his...bones.

1554
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,540
On top of that, you can now parry most of these enemies.

1555
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,860
Even bosses can often be parried.

1556
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,340
That's what let me finally beat the blood-starved beast

1557
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,660
after an embarrassing amount of attempts.

1558
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,540
I personally never got bored with dudes in armor.

1559
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,780
Like, that was just the most fun type of fight

1560
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,300
in the Souls series thus far.

1561
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,020
It wasn't broken, but Bloodborne fixed it

1562
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,340
by coming up with many different kinds of monster,

1563
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,660
but making the fights feel super responsive

1564
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,020
to your actions within them.

1565
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,540
I haven't played Dark Souls 3 yet

1566
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,460
because I wanted to make this video first,

1567
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:49,500
but I hope that if it does have more monstery-type enemies,

1568
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,580
it has this kind of responsiveness also.

1569
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:55,020
I would honestly prefer to have even more dudes in armor

1570
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,140
than bad dogs or bad rats.

1571
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,820
Oh, no, not that! No!

1572
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,700
Okay, also, the blood vials is just a great healing system.

1573
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,700
Or just all the way through.

1574
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,700
Like, I talked before about how the Estus Flask

1575
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,740
is really, really good

1576
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:10,060
because it's an infinite source of health,

1577
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,700
but the trade-off there is there aren't any items

1578
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,620
you can then also use for healing.

1579
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,500
You just have that finite resource.

1580
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,340
What I quite like about Bloodborne's system

1581
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,660
is you have a lot of healing items,

1582
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,780
but they're finite.

1583
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,260
You have enough that it's not ever a huge problem,

1584
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,460
but you can theoretically run out.

1585
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,140
So it becomes more like,

1586
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,220
but you always have enough vials to get your health back

1587
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,740
almost all the way after an encounter

1588
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,860
so you can keep going.

1589
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,900
But on top of that,

1590
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,940
you are really likely to pick blood vials up

1591
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,780
as you go in fights with people.

1592
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,380
For example, in this section, I lose a ton of health,

1593
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,020
but I get all the vials back as a result of the fight,

1594
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,460
so it feels balanced.

1595
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,740
And since they don't always drop,

1596
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,060
I am eventually supposed to get better.

1597
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,100
I don't, but still.

1598
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,820
One issue in Demon's Souls that kind of made it broken

1599
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,420
was you could, at a certain point,

1600
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,420
buy a hundred of the best healing item

1601
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,620
and just carry them around

1602
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,380
and basically be invincible.

1603
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,420
Which, I mean, is maybe a problem

1604
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,780
if a game is supposed to be challenging.

1605
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,340
Bloodborne kind of fixes it

1606
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,940
by giving you a really good healing item

1607
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,140
and giving you quite a lot,

1608
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,580
but having an upper limit on how many

1609
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,100
you could ever possibly have.

1610
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,140
So I feel like Bloodborne might have perfected the system

1611
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,220
by giving you a lot of a finite amount of thing.

1612
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,500
However, it is possible to run out

1613
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,860
and have to farm for them,

1614
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,540
which isn't so great.

1615
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,740
In my opinion, they could have had it

1616
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,780
so you always start with 20 or even 10 blood vials

1617
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,260
and continue to pick them up the way you do now.

1618
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,860
But that would completely take away the idea

1619
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,380
of being able to stock up on them

1620
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,980
and use them like a regular item

1621
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,020
and sell them and stuff,

1622
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,020
so maybe there's a reason why they didn't do that.

1623
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,500
I mean, maybe the game designers did stuff on purpose.

1624
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,220
I don't know.

1625
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,380
Blood vials also heal a set percentage

1626
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,900
of your maximum health,

1627
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,900
so they're always a useful source of healing,

1628
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,980
unlike, for example, the Crescent Moongrass,

1629
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,060
which is just piss.

1630
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,500
Also, you heal a lot faster.

1631
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,220
In previous games, they wanted healing

1632
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,740
to be like this risk-reward thing

1633
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,940
where you stop,

1634
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,300
so if you want to heal,

1635
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,020
you're taking a huge risk in leaving yourself open.

1636
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,500
But it seems like they settled in Bloodborne

1637
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,620
of having it be a really quick thing

1638
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,060
you can do almost any time

1639
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,820
and just forgiving you for that.

1640
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:14,780
And that's okay.

1641
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,860
Maybe it theoretically makes it less challenging

1642
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,660
in some ways,

1643
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,940
but it's worth it

1644
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,100
because it means you don't die while healing,

1645
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,020
and that just feels bad,

1646
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,220
even if it's your fault.

1647
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,420
But since they took that out,

1648
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,500
now you only ever die because you failed to dodge

1649
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,700
or because you were attacking

1650
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,580
when you shouldn't have done,

1651
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,580
and that, I think, feels a lot better.

1652
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,060
🎶

1653
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,700
There are still some criticisms I have of Bloodborne, though,

1654
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,580
where it falls short or seems to take a step back.

1655
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,780
Here's a kind of big thing.

1656
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,820
I'm a little disappointed by the NPC encounters.

1657
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,540
The NPCs in Souls games have about as much health as you,

1658
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,620
or at least an amount that seems fair.

1659
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,700
However, they can do things like heal.

1660
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,740
It's fun and cool,

1661
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,860
and there's back and forth,

1662
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,460
and it's just always neat.

1663
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,020
I like the garden leading up to the Sith boss fight quite a lot

1664
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,180
just because of all the cool, unique NPCs

1665
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,460
that come to wreck your shit,

1666
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,860
including Man With Inferior Jump Attack.

1667
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,140
Aw, there, there.

1668
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,580
🔔

1669
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,980
An idiot who forgot that arrows move in slow motion

1670
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,260
in Dark Souls Land.

1671
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,220
And oh, wow, Patrick Klepek's Demon's Souls character

1672
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,180
is here, too.

1673
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,100
And if you really like fighting characters

1674
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,780
with similar abilities to you,

1675
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:21,100
there's a cat who wants to help you protect the garden

1676
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,260
from other real human players.

1677
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,020
If you join their covenant and wear their ring,

1678
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,100
occasionally you get summoned in as a blue phantom,

1679
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,460
so you, yes, you can get backstabbed from ten feet away

1680
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,500
and wonder if PvP will ever fucking work in these games.

1681
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,820
In Bloodborne, stray hunters and hunter-sized bosses

1682
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,260
have obscene amounts of health.

1683
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,940
This puts you at a massive disadvantage

1684
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,260
and does away with the feeling that you're fighting an equal

1685
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,260
and instead fighting a boss version

1686
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,500
that doesn't really play by the same rules as you.

1687
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,540
Stop shooting me!

1688
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,820
Oh, my God!

1689
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,500
None of them can heal like you can,

1690
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,020
which kind of balances it out,

1691
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,460
but it doesn't feel right.

1692
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,660
Actually, no, some of them do heal

1693
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,780
and they get back a ton of health,

1694
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,060
and it's kind of messed up.

1695
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,300
I know it's possible to get in and make sure they don't,

1696
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,220
and it's more challenging for them to have more health,

1697
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:04,300
but it's not challenging in a way that's fun.

1698
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,420
It feels off.

1699
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,340
In my opinion, these fights would be better served

1700
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,260
if they had an equivalent amount of health as you

1701
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,340
but could get their health back from rallying like you

1702
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,180
and would heal themselves in a pinch.

1703
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,780
They'd be more interesting back and forth

1704
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,740
like in the previous games,

1705
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,300
and it wouldn't feel so much like a long, dull slog

1706
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,820
every time you refight them,

1707
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,140
getting them slowly back down to that last sliver

1708
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,540
before they suddenly shoot you dead instantly again.

1709
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,860
Great, now I have to come back and pick away at his health

1710
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,860
and hope he doesn't insta-kill me again.

1711
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,940
Bloodborne? More like blood...

1712
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,060
snorn.

1713
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:33,660
Gah.

1714
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,620
You can fucking hit me out of my combo

1715
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,060
while I'm hitting you.

1716
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,460
That is a fucked up thing to put in a game.

1717
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,700
That's fucked up, right?

1718
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,620
Also, they have seemingly infinite ammo,

1719
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,460
which is just rude.

1720
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,700
Weirdly enough, invasions by other players

1721
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:53,580
show off my version of this mechanic perfectly.

1722
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,460
I got invaded exactly once in my first playthrough,

1723
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,900
and it was exhilarating.

1724
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,900
We both came close to dying multiple times

1725
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,300
and made spaces to heal as we continued to fight.

1726
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,580
Healing is super quick,

1727
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,940
but the developers were smart enough

1728
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,300
to make this parryable.

1729
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,820
That's how I won in the end.

1730
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,580
I kind of wish I'd been invaded more,

1731
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,340
and that's not really something I say often

1732
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,620
about the Souls series.

1733
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,780
Maybe I'm just being a big whiny baby here,

1734
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,700
or maybe that one invasion was so fun

1735
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,460
it's forced me to wish there were more fights

1736
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,660
like that in the game itself,

1737
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,340
but I think an improvement I'd like to see

1738
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,940
in a theoretical Bloodborne 2

1739
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,460
would be more enemies that resemble

1740
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,660
that kind of encounter.

1741
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,260
I want the sense that the other hunters

1742
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,500
got where they did by being exceptionally skilled

1743
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,180
with the same assets as me,

1744
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,860
not because they inexplicably had

1745
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,660
many times more health and infinite ammo.

1746
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,160
Oh.

1747
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:37,740
But because of these dead...

1748
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,240
Stop it!

1749
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,260
But because of these dead...

1750
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1751
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,540
I also think the blood vial system,

1752
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,580
while good and fun,

1753
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,060
has the inherent downsides of if you run out,

1754
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,340
you can't easily buy more

1755
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,820
because they're just a bit too expensive per vial,

1756
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,180
and if you're in an area or boss

1757
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,140
that kills you a lot,

1758
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,060
you're not going to be recovering them from enemies,

1759
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,220
so you inevitably have to go farm vials

1760
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,340
or the souls to buy them,

1761
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,100
and that's just not great when it happens.

1762
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,020
There's also some incredibly weird bits

1763
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,300
where enemies aren't designed

1764
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,820
for the areas you find them in,

1765
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,780
like some of the bosses

1766
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,860
or the giants in Cathedral Ward.

1767
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,060
I'd like you to tell me

1768
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,500
what even hit me there,

1769
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,980
and why do you have to go back

1770
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,100
to the central hub

1771
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,540
every time you want to go somewhere?

1772
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,580
That's kind of annoying.

1773
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,260
These are all relatively small problems

1774
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,220
in the grand scheme.

1775
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,740
My main problem with the game

1776
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,180
is also the best demonstration

1777
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,580
of why the rest of Bloodborne is so good.

1778
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,580
The chalice dungeons.

1779
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,580
Oh my god!

1780
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,420
They're a completely optional part of the game

1781
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,620
where you can go into dungeons

1782
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,500
and traverse them,

1783
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,020
fighting more bosses and enemies,

1784
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,700
and some of them are randomly generated,

1785
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,980
meaning there is theoretically

1786
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,500
infinite content in Bloodborne,

1787
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,500
but I'm going to be honest,

1788
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,100
they're really bad.

1789
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,060
By stripping out the part

1790
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,500
where the levels are carefully designed

1791
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,180
to be fun and good and interesting

1792
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,580
and challenge you in a fair and reactive way,

1793
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,140
the dungeon segments can be teeth-grindingly bad

1794
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,500
in ways that simply aren't fun.

1795
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,180
Accidentally,

1796
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,300
they're object lessons

1797
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,380
in why we still have level designers

1798
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,660
and don't just have a computer

1799
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,100
churn out all our levels.

1800
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,260
The chalice dungeons are so lazily put together

1801
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:01,980
that this guy,

1802
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,020
who spawns in, like,

1803
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,140
all of the important rooms

1804
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,420
in any given dungeon,

1805
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,580
like, one of the bosses in the dungeons

1806
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,780
is just three of him.

1807
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,540
So on some floors,

1808
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,140
you beat one of these guys,

1809
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,220
hit the switch that unlocks the boss door,

1810
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,900
and then you fight three more of him,

1811
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,400
and you're like,

1812
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:17,600
what?

1813
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,340
You know, I've heard criticisms

1814
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,780
that some enemies in the Souls series

1815
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,980
start to get repetitive,

1816
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,020
but honestly,

1817
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,500
they don't even come close to this,

1818
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
where you're literally just fighting the same guy

1819
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,580
over and over in different permutations.

1820
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,860
I'm not covering the chalice dungeons

1821
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,900
in very much detail here

1822
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,900
because I feel like I've talked about Bloodborne

1823
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,780
enough at this point,

1824
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,420
so it's not really going to hammer home

1825
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,100
how just bad this is.

1826
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:39,600
Like,

1827
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,580
this room you're seeing right now,

1828
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,940
you will see this room copied

1829
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,220
over and over

1830
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:44,940
for hours.

1831
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,100
That is all the chalice dungeons are.

1832
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:47,900
There are,

1833
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,400
there are, like,

1834
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,340
five, six different kinds of room

1835
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,380
repeated

1836
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,660
over and over.

1837
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,100
Honestly, watch this part of the video

1838
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:55,900
on a loop for, like,

1839
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,740
two and a half hours,

1840
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,380
and you will have a full replication

1841
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,060
of about as much of the chalice dungeon

1842
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,060
as I can stand to record

1843
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,100
to make this video.

1844
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,300
Even the pre-made dungeons

1845
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,660
are just the same kind of rooms

1846
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,740
in different configurations over and over.

1847
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:10,860
It's not great.

1848
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,980
You know what it reminded me of?

1849
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,740
Kingsfield.

1850
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,460
And no game should be like Kingsfield.

1851
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,100
Oh, hey, look.

1852
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,140
It's another one of those.

1853
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,220
I'm so fucking surprised.

1854
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,740
They also reveal how good

1855
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,700
the rest of the game is

1856
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,700
by showing how much care and attention

1857
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,740
must have gone into making

1858
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,100
all the areas and encounters

1859
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,100
look and feel as good as they do.

1860
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,380
And they do that by showing

1861
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,660
how lacking the game would have been

1862
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,860
if they hadn't been there.

1863
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,140
Yharnam does the impossible

1864
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,140
by feeling varied and huge and complex

1865
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,420
while being primarily focused

1866
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,300
on one big kind of similar-looking town

1867
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,380
made of very similar kinds of architecture

1868
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,100
throughout.

1869
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,700
The chalice dungeons remind me

1870
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,060
of the parts of dungeon crawlers

1871
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,740
that don't hold up to scrutiny either.

1872
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,740
They're almost literally just box rooms

1873
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,420
with grimy stone textures

1874
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,380
thrown up everywhere.

1875
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,220
If Bloodborne were released as a roguelike

1876
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,620
that used this randomly generated stuff

1877
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,380
or if the whole game looked and felt

1878
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,820
like the chalice dungeons,

1879
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,180
I think I would hate it.

1880
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,780
There's this game called Necropolis.

1881
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,700
It's billed as a Dark Souls roguelike.

1882
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,220
It's kind of boring.

1883
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,660
The enemies are repetitive.

1884
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,940
There's no boss fights.

1885
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,860
Even quick attacks feel slow

1886
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,300
like in Lords of the Fallen.

1887
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,340
And more importantly,

1888
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,700
the lack of design

1889
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,460
in any of the levels or environments

1890
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,740
means there's no character

1891
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,100
or feel to the world.

1892
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,300
It's the chalice dungeons

1893
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,900
but without the upshot of being attached

1894
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,500
to an actually good game.

1895
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,620
I guess what I'm saying is

1896
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,980
I like games when they're...

1897
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:29,420
designed by people?

1898
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,220
Weirdly enough,

1899
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,420
while some of the new bosses

1900
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,020
that only appear in the chalice dungeons

1901
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,620
are repeated a lot across them

1902
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,980
and clearly didn't have much time

1903
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:36,940
or effort put into them

1904
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,540
and don't strike me as particularly

1905
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,980
interesting in and of themselves,

1906
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,420
several of them are super fun

1907
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,180
to actually fight once you get to them.

1908
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,140
It's almost a shame

1909
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,500
that the content you have to pass through

1910
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,020
to get to them are kind of boring

1911
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,060
or actively unfun

1912
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,820
because they're worthy encounters.

1913
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,340
I almost wonder if all the bosses

1914
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,060
you encounter here

1915
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:52,940
are the ones they made

1916
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,140
and weren't happy with

1917
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:54,940
so they didn't bother

1918
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,300
putting them in the main game,

1919
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,260
which naturally means

1920
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,060
the best ones here

1921
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,260
are the ones that feel the most

1922
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,020
like they should have been after all.

1923
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:01,740
Look at that!

1924
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,020
There's a boss from earlier

1925
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,300
in the regular dungeons

1926
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,500
just walking around

1927
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,660
and he's surrounded by two other bosses

1928
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,260
from earlier in this dungeon

1929
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,180
and they—they kill him for me!

1930
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:12,860
What?!

1931
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,740
The chalice dungeons

1932
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,100
make a lot of points for me

1933
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,860
about the importance of level design

1934
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,300
and execution in these games

1935
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,980
and show how the base mechanics alone

1936
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:20,860
wouldn't be enough

1937
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,020
for an engaging and fun experience.

1938
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,220
You need the push and pull

1939
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,900
of a designer hiding enemies

1940
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,420
in just the right places,

1941
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,260
scaling the difficulty of encounters

1942
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,380
through careful development

1943
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,740
of enemy placement and so on.

1944
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,420
Oh, I fucking see you, mate.

1945
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:35,980
Yeah, I've played—

1946
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,260
I've played a video game before.

1947
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,020
You're not weird, are you?

1948
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:39,740
Welcome—

1949
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,740
Welcome to Dark Souls!

1950
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:42,860
That's the first trick

1951
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,980
they pull in all those games.

1952
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:44,780
Yep.

1953
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,300
You got me the first time through.

1954
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,980
This is a true Souls game.

1955
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:49,340
Don't even bother

1956
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,220
looking at what I picked up.

1957
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,540
The real victory was—

1958
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,260
Oh, Jesus!

1959
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,540
I was feeling so full of myself then

1960
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,980
and, like, another guy came.

1961
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:01,420
Holy shit.

1962
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,260
This game's amazing.

1963
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,820
If you like walking from box room

1964
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,340
to box room full

1965
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,180
just of a bunch of random enemies

1966
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:09,900
plopped in there

1967
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,300
and, oh, look, it's another one of those,

1968
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,700
then I guess

1969
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,140
the chalice dungeons are for you.

1970
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,060
If you like the chalice dungeons

1971
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,020
and the randomness,

1972
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,700
I can see an appeal to that,

1973
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,300
but let's admit that

1974
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,980
the actual game is more fun

1975
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,060
and if that, for you,

1976
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,020
is a contentious point,

1977
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,900
then I'm sorry,

1978
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,620
but you are beneath me.

1979
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,980
Here's the part where I wrap up

1980
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,260
and give some pithy comments

1981
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,620
about how developers have things

1982
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:42,460
to learn from Bloodborne,

1983
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,980
but do they?

1984
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,580
Not every game has to learn something

1985
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,380
from Bloodborne.

1986
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,660
Not every game is attempting

1987
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,340
such a sharp, crackling,

1988
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,300
deliberateness,

1989
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,580
such a test of perception

1990
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,500
and prediction over raw mechanical input

1991
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,100
or simpler sorts of puzzle

1992
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,340
or such a specific sense of uncertainty

1993
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,620
and esoteric horror.

1994
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,540
While many designers might well recognize

1995
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,500
in Bloodborne a method

1996
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,300
they could get across

1997
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,140
their own intended reaction better,

1998
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,180
a way of helping players

1999
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,380
to get the best experience

2000
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,020
from their work

2001
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,220
by altering the attitude

2002
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,500
with which they perceive it,

2003
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,420
an equal, if not larger amount,

2004
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,620
should strive to learn

2005
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,820
absolutely nothing.

2006
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,700
Gamers everywhere

2007
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,540
have already had years of laughing

2008
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,740
and attempts to commodify

2009
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,580
their enjoyment of the Souls series.

2010
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,500
The endless descriptions of new games

2011
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:21,900
with,

2012
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:22,940
it's like Dark Souls,

2013
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:23,980
but with Y.

2014
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:24,940
The sad truth is,

2015
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:25,980
the most common reason

2016
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,500
the Souls games didn't have Y

2017
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,300
is because they would have been

2018
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,260
the worst for it.

2019
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,940
You know, I thought I wanted a roguelike

2020
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,380
that was a bit like Dark Souls,

2021
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,740
but then when I actually got it,

2022
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,180
I realized there was a reason

2023
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,700
why they didn't make one of those

2024
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,820
in the first place.

2025
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,820
More importantly is the wider critical

2026
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,420
and cultural overreaction

2027
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,260
to the series and its popularity.

2028
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:43,980
While lots of folks

2029
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,260
have always been super positive

2030
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:45,980
about the series,

2031
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,420
even since Demon's Souls,

2032
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,620
its spiritual successor

2033
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,060
becoming a genuine smash hit

2034
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,660
with a huge swath of players

2035
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,020
has caused lots of games writers

2036
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,460
to kind of go into overdrive

2037
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,500
about the series.

2038
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,100
I can already predict one comment

2039
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,140
someone paused this video

2040
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,340
halfway through to leave.

2041
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,540
Why did you bring up Thumper

2042
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,660
right in the middle of this?

2043
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,020
Thumper's a rhythm game.

2044
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:03,740
What does it have to do

2045
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,740
with bloody action, adventure,

2046
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,900
RPG things like the Souls games?

2047
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,340
Well, apart from the general point

2048
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,300
I made about how games

2049
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,340
can engross you,

2050
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:11,900
you're right.

2051
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,100
It doesn't really have much in common

2052
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,380
with the Souls series.

2053
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,500
The main reason I brought it up

2054
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,620
was because when I was reading

2055
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,420
reviews of Thumper

2056
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,100
to see what people thought about it,

2057
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,300
I found a review that called it

2058
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,460
the Dark Souls of Rhythm Games.

2059
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,900
I could say that calling something

2060
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,260
the Dark Souls of something

2061
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,020
or saying something is like Dark Souls

2062
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,220
for the sake of comparison

2063
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,020
and easy clicks

2064
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,860
is just poor and cliche writing,

2065
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:31,900
and it kind of is,

2066
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,340
but it's more that we as critics

2067
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,860
have a duty to communicate

2068
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,380
why something is good.

2069
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,660
Thumper has done a disservice

2070
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,540
by being described

2071
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,460
as the Dark Souls of Rhythm Games

2072
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,980
because it indicates that we still

2073
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,340
don't have the language

2074
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,300
to really explain

2075
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,660
why something is good

2076
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,780
without having to compare it

2077
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:48,140
to a singular experience

2078
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,060
that isn't really all that much like it

2079
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,820
when you really get down to it.

2080
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,820
I remember Yahtzee's Dark Souls review.

2081
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,340
In it, he makes this point.

2082
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,460
So I'd ask them to explain

2083
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:56,940
why it's good,

2084
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,580
and they'd reply,

2085
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,540
ooh, we can't tell you.

2086
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,820
You just have to find out for yourself.

2087
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,700
And then I'd say,

2088
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,980
shut up or fuck off,

2089
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,500
ideally both in either order.

2090
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,020
He kind of skips over it for a joke,

2091
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:05,820
but what he's doing here

2092
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,500
is actually describing the problem.

2093
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,460
We as a community

2094
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,260
are sometimes unable

2095
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,220
to really come up with

2096
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,740
why we think something is good

2097
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,700
or we enjoy it,

2098
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,780
and it leaves us having to vaguely

2099
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,140
gesture in a game's direction

2100
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,900
because words have failed us.

2101
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,340
It's a hard series to pin down,

2102
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,380
I know, trust me.

2103
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,980
I've just spent a really long time

2104
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,020
trying to do so

2105
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,060
because when we grapple

2106
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,980
with why we enjoy something,

2107
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,260
we're ultimately interrogating

2108
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,220
our own feelings,

2109
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,500
and that's a very difficult thing

2110
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,460
to do indeed.

2111
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,500
At least I assume that's why

2112
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,260
my therapist charges so much.

2113
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,900
But good criticism means good discourse.

2114
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,900
I can completely see why writers,

2115
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,020
critics, and journalists

2116
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,540
use the shorthands they do,

2117
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,140
but I think the onus is on us

2118
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,340
to try not to,

2119
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,940
to be willing to be long,

2120
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:45,820
complicated,

2121
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,940
willing to be, yeah,

2122
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,980
even a little bit boring

2123
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,180
or pedantic at times

2124
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,980
in order to explore

2125
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,820
the qualities of gaming experiences

2126
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,180
in a truly valuable way,

2127
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,060
which I hope I've done,

2128
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,660
but knowing me, I probably, uh...

2129
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,100
didn't.

2130
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,460
For things to fully get judged

2131
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,500
on their own merit,

2132
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,860
we have to start examining

2133
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,300
the actual merits

2134
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,980
in concrete terms.

2135
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,460
For the record,

2136
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,140
the most accurate comparison I've seen

2137
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,580
is when Patrick Klepek described

2138
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,940
beating a Mario Maker level

2139
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,980
as like the feeling of

2140
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,340
beating a Dark Souls boss.

2141
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,500
The point is the level achieved a feeling

2142
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,620
rather than having any

2143
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,060
pure mechanical similarity.

2144
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,740
I mean, they're completely different genres.

2145
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,580
It's hard to do that comparison right,

2146
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,100
but Scoops managed it.

2147
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:21,660
Hmm.

2148
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,700
A hard thing to do

2149
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,540
that only a few people achieve?

2150
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,220
I guess that makes Patrick Klepek

2151
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,140
the Dark Souls of Game Critic.

2152
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,500
Bloodborne,

2153
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,100
a game about injecting yourself

2154
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,140
with increasing amounts

2155
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,820
of dangerous liquid,

2156
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,460
is itself the ultimate gateway drug.

2157
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,980
The precise beauty

2158
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,820
of the particulars of the experience

2159
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:41,340
make for a fantastic thing

2160
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,300
all on its own.

2161
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,540
But perhaps more importantly

2162
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,980
than being one of the best games

2163
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,180
of its generation,

2164
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,540
it inoculates its players

2165
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,580
against the problems

2166
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,020
the Souls series has previously

2167
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,340
been unable to rid itself for years.

2168
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,260
The previous games were really good,

2169
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,220
but their design

2170
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,740
accidentally necessitated

2171
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,620
ways of playing it

2172
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,740
that were conservative

2173
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:01,260
and just not all that fun

2174
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,540
to actually do.

2175
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,300
It was, to coin yet another

2176
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,900
unfitting food metaphor,

2177
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,580
being handed a very good

2178
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,460
bowl of soup,

2179
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,420
shout-out to soup,

2180
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,660
but being given a shield-shaped

2181
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,180
pitchfork to eat it with.

2182
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,540
It took a lot of time to realize

2183
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,660
there were more funner ways

2184
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,420
of doing it than it presented itself,

2185
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:17,980
and by then,

2186
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,740
people had lost their appetite.

2187
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,580
Bloodborne is better soup,

2188
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,620
but more importantly,

2189
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,740
it's soup that comes with

2190
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,180
a piece of paper that says,

2191
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,700
hey, don't use the shield.

2192
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,620
Just find a spoon or some bread

2193
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,820
or just pour me directly

2194
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:30,540
into your mouth.

2195
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,540
Also, the bowl somehow

2196
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,380
also contains a theoretical

2197
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,540
infinite amount of bad soup

2198
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,580
that tastes awful,

2199
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:38,540
but it's cordoned off

2200
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:39,820
from the good parts of the soup

2201
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,980
and completely optional to consume.

2202
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,940
Okay, I probably should have

2203
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,060
written a conclusion out.

2204
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,420
This isn't doing very good.

2205
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,340
What ways do I expect the series

2206
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,020
to be improved on in the future?

2207
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,540
Well, I'm honestly daunted

2208
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:51,340
by the genius

2209
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,780
of the FromSoftware team,

2210
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,540
so I really can't wait

2211
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,900
to be surprised

2212
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,020
by how they improve on it

2213
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:57,900
in the future.

2214
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,940
At the very least, though,

2215
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,380
I do hope that Bloodborne 2

2216
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,220
comes with complimentary breadsticks.

2217
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,180
I can't end the video like that.

2218
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:05,680
I can't.

2219
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,180
I can't.

2220
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,280

And Rikami

2283
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,040
While the rest of the credits going past, uh, in case you want to know,

2284
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,600
yes, I am planning a Fallout 4 video,

2285
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,600
but it's taking some time because I want to approach it with enough critical distance that

2286
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,640
I give it a proper shot, you know? I want to take my time with it.

2287
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,200
So I want to make at least one more long video in this style about something else first.

2288
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,000
If you think about it, it took me eight years to make the Fallout 3 video,

2289
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,520
and as of November 10th, Fallout 4 has only been out for one.

2290
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,880
So give me a little bit, you know?

2291
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,440
The best part about this video being over is I still haven't played Dark Souls 3

2292
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:04,400
or the DLC for Bloodborne because I've been too busy making this video since, like, July?

2293
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,920
This video was supposed to originally come out in October as, like, a Halloween special,

2294
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,080
but I missed that.

2295
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,440
So, like, I can finally play video games again.

2296
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,360
People who back me get access to bonus videos,

2297
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,440
and also I recorded, like, 24 hours of footage of me playing Bloodborne

2298
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,960
with a friend that I'm going to put out there.

2299
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,720
So there's that.

2300
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:34,320
But also I shot a pretty elaborate sketch for this video that I decided to take out

2301
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,640
because I realized it was just complete nonsense.

2302
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,120
So that stuff's going to be going up soon.

2303
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,040
I really want to put out a bunch of bonus videos.

2304
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,600
I've been kind of putting off working on them to get this video out at all ever.

2305
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,600
So I feel really bad about that.

2306
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,720
So I'm going to put a whole bunch of those things out as soon as I can.

2307
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
So bear with me.

2308
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:06,480
Wow, you sat through all of those?

2309
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,560
That's very nice of you.

2310
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,360
If you backed me, I certainly hope I managed to get your name in there.

2311
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,400
I always worry if I somehow miss names,

2312
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,480
even though I literally just copy and paste it from a list.

2313
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,160
If I've made a huge mistake, let me know.

2314
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,120
But as a present for the nice folks who bothered to sit through the credits

2315
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,920
of all the people who allowed me to keep making this stuff,

2316
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,480
I'd like to just throw some game names out there.

2317
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,400
Shadow of Mordor,

2318
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,040
Deus Ex Human Revolution,

2319
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,160
Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines.

2320
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:37,440
Feel free to write one of those names in a comment on this video

2321
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,360
and see what it causes to happen.
