WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
I'm going to go out of my way for once and talk about something positive.

00:02.840 --> 00:05.540
I'm going to talk about a game I really, really like.

00:05.540 --> 00:08.740
I'm going to talk about Bloodborne, and why it's amazing.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.420
["Bloodborne Theme Song"]

00:11.420 --> 00:16.720
["Bloodborne Theme Song Fades Out"]

00:16.720 --> 00:22.260
["Bloodborne Theme Song Fades In"]

00:22.260 --> 00:25.180
Okay, to start off, we're going to have to establish a baseline, aren't we?

00:25.180 --> 00:28.180
Bloodborne's amazing, but the Souls series has always been good.

00:28.180 --> 00:31.480
Let's start by talking in basic terms about the core gameplay.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.020
They are, when you boil it down, basically action games attempting to recreate the same sort of stuff

00:36.020 --> 00:38.900
RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons were designed to simulate.

00:38.900 --> 00:42.320
Adventures in magical lands with dungeons and or dragons.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.460
They control in a vaguely similar way to other third-person action games like Devil May Cry,

00:46.460 --> 00:50.040
or Drakengard, or Dynasty Warriors, or even The Legend of Zelda.

00:50.040 --> 00:55.480
However, despite superficial resemblance, in practice, the games operate very differently from those.

00:55.480 --> 01:01.620
All the games I just mentioned here have a focus on instantaneousness, fluidity, and flow or speed.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.900
You press the button, and the character is immediately doing the thing.

01:04.900 --> 01:10.500
Dante is doing the stabby, or the jumpy, or the flippy as soon as you press the button commanding him to do it.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.000
He's such a good boy.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.580
In lots of these games, you can even cancel a move you're currently doing into another move.

01:16.580 --> 01:20.380
So if you realized you actually pressed the wrong button, you can get away with pressing the right one,

01:20.380 --> 01:23.040
and Dante cleans up after your mistakes for you.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.040
It's like McDonald's or Casual Sex.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.500
It's... fine?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.340
You know, like, it'll do?

01:28.340 --> 01:33.080
But outside of higher difficulties, there's this sense of never really earning anything to me.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.220
I hit the relevant button based on when it was clearly telegraphing that I should be doing it,

01:37.220 --> 01:38.640
and then it happened instantly.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.300
It's missing something.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.720
The Souls games are theoretically similar, but choose such a different core design philosophy

01:44.720 --> 01:49.260
that I bet some of you winced when I compared them to character action games the way I just did.

01:49.260 --> 01:53.300
When you press the attack button in a Souls game, you've not just committed to an attack.

01:53.300 --> 01:58.260
You've committed to the long, arduous process of signing the proper paperwork to get planning permission

01:58.260 --> 02:00.380
to start to swing your sword.

02:00.380 --> 02:03.100
You don't immediately see dividends on the button you pressed.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.060
You have to wait for the attack to go off.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.220
On top of that, instead of attacking and moving being an infinite resource,

02:08.220 --> 02:12.060
you have a limited amount of stamina you can invest at any given time.

02:12.060 --> 02:15.280
So you can't rely on mashing the attack and dodge buttons to get by.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.580
And then, if you press the wrong button, you can't hit undo.

02:18.580 --> 02:21.580
You can't cancel out of an attack into the roll you should have done.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.340
You get stabbed instead.

02:23.340 --> 02:27.540
This creates an immediate friction between you and what you want to achieve.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.780
You can't just hit the button when you see an opening,

02:29.780 --> 02:32.460
or dance around and wait until one gets handed to you.

02:32.460 --> 02:35.820
You have to learn to prepare and observe the timing of your enemy,

02:35.820 --> 02:39.020
and be able to know when to act instead of simply acting,

02:39.020 --> 02:43.820
or use your limited stamina resource to create an opening by dodging an early attack.

02:43.820 --> 02:47.260
This is the main reason why the series has always been a little bit divisive.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.340
Its deliberateness puts it directly at odds with almost every other game of its type,

02:51.340 --> 02:56.100
which strive to make actions as quick as possible and give the player tons of control and freedom.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.060
However, it's for this same reason that you might find a Souls game more rewarding,

03:00.060 --> 03:03.620
because there's a genuine sense of having earned a victory once you get it.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.940
The tools you're given for victory are more limited.

03:05.940 --> 03:10.940
You're never going to feel like a badass who can flip all over the place or dodge infinitely any time they need to.

03:10.940 --> 03:16.260
But this makes winning with those more limited tools more satisfying and feel like a real achievement.

03:16.260 --> 03:22.580
There is something on a core level fun about this kind of setup that you don't really get in many other types of game.

03:22.580 --> 03:25.620
It also creates a much deeper appreciation for subtlety.

03:25.620 --> 03:31.060
Each Devil May Cry game, for example, has a huge array of monsters with ridiculously cool-looking moves and stuff,

03:31.060 --> 03:34.540
but there are so many on screen at a time, and it's so easy to actually deal with them,

03:34.540 --> 03:37.020
that there's less of a weight to an encounter.

03:37.020 --> 03:42.820
The game only starts feeling fun on really high difficulties when only a couple of those attacks would kill you,

03:42.820 --> 03:45.900
and you suddenly have to take everything really seriously.

03:45.900 --> 03:51.220
Meanwhile, just this one guy in Demon's Souls could, and generally usually does, kill me.

03:51.620 --> 03:55.500
I've had to put more thought into dealing with the red-eyed knights in Demon's Souls,

03:55.500 --> 04:00.460
or the black knights in Dark Souls, than basically every enemy in a Devil May Cry game put together.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.300
It's just that much more engaging.

04:02.300 --> 04:07.980
It makes every single encounter feel dense with prediction, timing, planning, and execution.

04:07.980 --> 04:12.780
You have to almost consider the psychology of your opponent to know the right time before you get there,

04:12.780 --> 04:15.820
and wait out the time it takes to do the thing you wanted to do,

04:15.820 --> 04:19.820
until you finally discover if you were accurate and everything goes as planned.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.060
There's something beautifully orgasmic to it.

04:22.060 --> 04:26.460
It's like cooking something difficult for yourself and sitting down and realizing you made something good,

04:26.460 --> 04:27.820
and now it's all yours.

04:27.820 --> 04:33.660
Every sliver of health you take from someone's meter was earned through this delicate interplay.

04:33.660 --> 04:38.060
It's so good, writing about it required me to do the thing game critics should never do,

04:38.060 --> 04:41.420
and start using unfitting metaphors for food and or sex.

04:41.420 --> 04:45.260
This stuff is hard to do well, and it really shows in games where it's done poorly.

04:45.260 --> 04:49.260
As an object lesson in bad versions of this, check out Lords of the Fallen,

04:49.260 --> 04:53.100
a game that was very clearly made by people who saw that Dark Souls was popular,

04:53.100 --> 04:55.260
and wanted to make one of those,

04:55.260 --> 05:00.220
but didn't quite figure out that it actually takes a lot of effort to make this kind of game fun.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.780
I've beaten this game all the way through twice.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.220
This game is terrible.

05:04.220 --> 05:08.620
Even the basic sword weapon is so slow and deliberate that it becomes a chore.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.620
There's no light running attack at all.

05:10.620 --> 05:13.020
Your guy just stops dead in his tracks.

05:13.020 --> 05:18.140
The controls are so slow and clunky that I was sure my computer was simply too slow to run it,

05:18.140 --> 05:20.300
but no, this is just how the game moves.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.180
There are fast weapons, but they never escape the damage curve,

05:23.180 --> 05:25.740
and you're basically either pressing the button to immediately swing,

05:25.740 --> 05:27.500
but dealing very little damage,

05:27.500 --> 05:30.540
or dealing more but waiting days for something to connect.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.940
I'm used to a weapon having a light attack, which is quicker,

05:32.940 --> 05:34.620
and a heavy attack, which is slower.

05:34.620 --> 05:38.140
When a weapon has a slow attack and an even slower attack,

05:38.140 --> 05:41.100
the entire feel of the game is broken.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.660
Great swords are basically impossible to use,

05:43.660 --> 05:47.580
except, for some reason, the running heavy attack comes out really fast,

05:47.580 --> 05:49.900
making it essentially the fastest move in the game.

05:49.900 --> 05:53.580
This one move carried me until I discovered the broken shield bash mechanic.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.020
I'm actually starting to worry about the fact I beat this game twice.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.700
I think that says something about me.

06:02.700 --> 06:07.420
Weapons in Dark Souls are balanced so well that you don't even notice until this aspect is missing.

06:07.420 --> 06:11.100
But it isn't just these central principles of control that make the series fun.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.940
What's more interesting is how the world tests your ability to use these mechanics,

06:14.940 --> 06:20.060
and thereby create the very specific feeling of adventure they do better than any other series.

06:20.060 --> 06:23.180
Let's take, for example, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.220
Maybe you've heard of it.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.420
It's a solid game.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.740
However, a couple of things irked me about it.

06:27.740 --> 06:31.020
One is how there's this constant need to explain itself to you.

06:31.020 --> 06:34.860
Every new concept, or creature, or enemy in the game is explained to you carefully,

06:34.860 --> 06:36.860
and in an easily digestible manner.

06:36.860 --> 06:41.100
When Stalfosses? Stalfosses? Stalfies?

06:41.100 --> 06:45.180
Spawn to attack you, they appear at a safe distance and then jump away.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.620
When a trap is introduced, it's shown to you in a way where you immediately know

06:48.620 --> 06:50.780
its entire path and what it does, and so on.

06:50.780 --> 06:53.900
The game loves to tell you in straightforward ways how it works,

06:53.900 --> 06:56.620
or what's happening, and let you deal with it how you want.

06:56.620 --> 07:02.780
This is, you know, fine, and I guess it's a masterpiece that I've loved my whole life.

07:02.780 --> 07:04.860
It's very fair on the player.

07:04.860 --> 07:08.060
But what I don't like about fairness is how it impacts the sense

07:08.060 --> 07:10.300
that you're supposed to be on an adventure.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.980
Link is trying to save the world by journeying into the heart of darkness

07:13.980 --> 07:16.060
and delivering the temples from evil.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.420
So why are the enemies taking the time to introduce themselves?

07:19.420 --> 07:22.940
And why are the traps making sure you know where they are and what they do?

07:22.940 --> 07:27.020
Evil is playing fair, and always being careful to show me its weak point.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.740
Nothing is ever quite surprising in Zelda.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.820
Maybe, for some types of games, fairness isn't actually a good thing.

07:33.900 --> 07:37.100
In making itself too clear about what's happening and how it works,

07:37.100 --> 07:39.180
it's probably more intuitive and playable,

07:39.180 --> 07:41.580
but it causes it to lack a truly great dimension

07:41.580 --> 07:44.220
of feeling like you're fighting against unknowable odds

07:44.220 --> 07:46.300
instead of being told them all the time.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.620
Looking back, there's something really weirdly sanitized about Zelda games.

07:50.620 --> 07:54.220
What makes the world of any given Souls game so much more interesting

07:54.220 --> 07:55.900
is that it doesn't play fair.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.980
Take, for example, Mimics in Dark Souls.

07:57.980 --> 08:01.260
The only way of learning that there are enemies in the game who look like chests

08:01.260 --> 08:03.740
and eat you to death if you try to open them

08:03.740 --> 08:06.620
is to find one and try to open it and die.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.300
This isn't bad design, though,

08:08.300 --> 08:11.180
like, oh, how dare they not give me the chance to not die there.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.860
It's good design.

08:12.860 --> 08:13.980
Because they've, quote-unquote,

08:13.980 --> 08:16.940
unfairly sacrificed the player's life that one time,

08:16.940 --> 08:20.780
they've thoroughly instilled a sense of paranoia and awareness

08:20.780 --> 08:23.980
and given you an even greater sense of having the odds stacked against you

08:23.980 --> 08:26.460
in a horrible world full of murder and death.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.380
It's not that the game is unfair to players,

08:28.380 --> 08:31.260
it's that the world itself is unfair to people.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.300
Life is unfair in the world of Dark Souls,

08:34.300 --> 08:37.020
and you learn that the hard way by dying in it.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.940
After you get eaten by one Mimic,

08:38.940 --> 08:42.700
before you know it, you'll be attacking every chest you see just in case.

08:42.700 --> 08:46.460
And in Dark Souls 2, you can accidentally destroy a chest if you attack it too much,

08:46.460 --> 08:49.740
meaning your own paranoia can be bad for you if you employ it the wrong way.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.380
It creates a more full sense of paranoia

08:52.380 --> 08:54.940
and being immersed in a world that wants you dead.

08:54.940 --> 08:57.020
And once you make it past a difficult area,

08:57.020 --> 08:57.900
beat a hard boss,

08:57.900 --> 09:01.020
or successfully predict that a chest is a Mimic and destroy it,

09:01.020 --> 09:04.700
you'll feel like you've gained ground against a genuinely dangerous world.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.780
The Souls games don't always play fair,

09:06.780 --> 09:09.340
but that makes besting them feel all the sweeter.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.180
Like a genuine victory, you know?

09:11.180 --> 09:13.980
And that feeling is worth getting killed,

09:13.980 --> 09:15.580
unfairly, a couple of times,

09:15.580 --> 09:18.540
because it creates the sense of there being great odds to beat.

09:18.540 --> 09:21.260
The feeling of triumphing against adversity is increased

09:21.260 --> 09:24.780
when that adversity has already actually killed you at least once.

09:24.780 --> 09:27.900
This is where the idea of the game's insane difficulty comes from.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.500
Not the game's actual difficulty,

09:29.500 --> 09:31.660
but the way they keep introducing you to new elements

09:31.660 --> 09:34.700
by killing you with them to create a specific sense of mood.

09:35.340 --> 09:38.700
The only way to know there's going to be traps in this area in Bloodborne

09:38.700 --> 09:42.380
is to step on this pile of, in retrospect, really conspicuous wood,

09:42.380 --> 09:43.180
hear the click,

09:44.460 --> 09:45.740
and shit yourself.

09:45.740 --> 09:49.180
Or if you're a badass, you can dodge it and then go about your merry way.

09:50.380 --> 09:53.420
The first time you fall for a trap, you're looking for them everywhere.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.940
You've approached the whole game with a se-

09:54.940 --> 09:55.980
Oh, fuck!

09:55.980 --> 09:58.300
You've approached the whole game with a greater sense of awareness

09:58.300 --> 10:00.220
and appreciation for its design.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.900
You'll still get caught in a few traps,

10:01.900 --> 10:05.340
but they'll always feel a bit like you could have done more to see them coming.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.180
By the time you get to Cainhurst Castle,

10:07.180 --> 10:11.980
the battlements have raised floors that look just a little bit like plates for traps,

10:11.980 --> 10:14.060
so I avoided them at all costs.

10:14.060 --> 10:16.860
Now, it turns out that's just what the floor looks like.

10:17.740 --> 10:22.140
Any game that successfully makes you afraid of a quirky pavement

10:22.140 --> 10:24.540
is unquestionably a masterpiece.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.140
It's bred a sincere, visceral fear of your surroundings

10:28.140 --> 10:29.900
based on how they've treated you in the past.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.500
It's- it's wonderful.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.980
The Souls games get into you, like, inside your head,

10:35.980 --> 10:39.420
and all the gesticulating about crazy difficulty melts away

10:39.420 --> 10:41.580
in the face of a fun, unforgiving,

10:41.580 --> 10:44.060
but enriching series of encounters that test you

10:44.060 --> 10:45.820
in ways games rarely manage to do,

10:45.820 --> 10:47.740
an almost internal level.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.460
You stop doing the maths about how quickly your attack goes off

10:50.460 --> 10:52.460
and trying to figure out an opening to move,

10:52.460 --> 10:54.860
and you start to just know the right time,

10:54.860 --> 10:57.500
because all this stuff is so deep in your head

10:57.500 --> 10:58.700
that you don't even have to think about it.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.140
It becomes like an instinct.

11:00.140 --> 11:04.220
The only experience that comes close lately is a rhythm game called Thumper.

11:04.220 --> 11:06.780
It's dark, it's noisy, it's metallic.

11:06.780 --> 11:08.620
It's a world of jaggedness,

11:08.620 --> 11:09.820
like a journey through hell,

11:09.820 --> 11:12.620
riding directly into the mouth of hell, even.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.060
Like, that thing's a boss.

11:14.060 --> 11:15.420
And it's very unforgiving.

11:15.420 --> 11:18.700
You die in two hits, but at a certain point, you stop dying,

11:18.700 --> 11:22.060
because the rhythm, the sound gets inside you.

11:22.060 --> 11:25.420
The line between player and game feels like it's evaporated.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.060
You begin to sense what notes are coming next,

11:28.060 --> 11:31.260
because the music has got into you on an almost instinctive level.

11:31.260 --> 11:34.380
You can't really sell Thumper or the Souls games

11:34.380 --> 11:36.540
to someone based purely on their mechanics,

11:36.540 --> 11:38.220
because the enjoyable thing about these games

11:38.220 --> 11:39.820
is when all these things are so ingrained

11:39.820 --> 11:42.460
that the mechanics themselves seem to fade away,

11:42.460 --> 11:45.420
and you're fully transported into the salviatic nightmare

11:45.420 --> 11:47.020
of sound and sight.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.300
Salviatic.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.620
I just made up a word

11:50.620 --> 11:53.660
attempting to describe the feeling a game gave me.

11:53.660 --> 11:57.260
Generally, generally that's a sign that something good is happening.

11:57.260 --> 12:00.460
Why am I talking about Thumper, a rhythm game, here?

12:00.460 --> 12:02.140
Well, you'll have to find out.

12:02.140 --> 12:03.980
There's probably a reason.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.100
Oh, God, is there a reason?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.380
Shit, did I write that part down?

12:06.380 --> 12:08.300
Oh, fuck, this page is blank.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.500
I'm just...

12:09.500 --> 12:12.940
I'm just fiddling with paper to make it sound like I wrote a script.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.780
Shit, I forgot where I'm going with this.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.980
And now for the reason this video was made.

12:17.980 --> 12:20.700
I know, I make videos on purpose for a reason.

12:20.700 --> 12:21.420
Who'd have thought?

12:21.420 --> 12:23.980
Okay, so I'm pretty into the Souls series.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.740
I saw lots of people playing Demon's Souls

12:25.740 --> 12:27.740
but couldn't afford a PS3 at the time,

12:27.740 --> 12:29.980
got on board with the PC version of Dark Souls—

12:29.980 --> 12:31.020
yeah, that version—

12:31.020 --> 12:32.140
but I really liked it,

12:32.140 --> 12:34.780
and I also really like Dark Souls 2.

12:34.780 --> 12:35.900
Um...

12:35.900 --> 12:37.180
Okay, come on, it's—it's good.

12:37.180 --> 12:37.820
It's—it's—

12:37.820 --> 12:39.580
I later went back and played Demon's Souls as well

12:39.580 --> 12:41.980
and very briefly delved into the precursor series,

12:41.980 --> 12:45.020
King's Field, before realizing they were a bit crap and stopping.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.180
Generally, I'd call myself a big fan.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.980
I could talk for a long time about why the series is great.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.700
In fact, I fully intend to do that right now.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.500
But up until 2015, the series had a problem.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.980
It's the kind of vague problem that's hard to talk about,

12:57.980 --> 13:00.460
especially because I don't actually have that problem.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.820
A lot of people seem not to really be able to get into them and enjoy them.

13:03.820 --> 13:05.980
There's a pretty large group of people who do really like them,

13:05.980 --> 13:08.060
then another group of people who pick every game up

13:08.060 --> 13:11.100
but don't really get too far before getting kind of done with it,

13:11.100 --> 13:13.660
and another group that probably don't really get them at all.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.300
I have a sneaking suspicion that videos about Souls games

13:16.300 --> 13:17.820
get super popular in the first place

13:17.820 --> 13:20.540
because people watch them so they don't have to play the games

13:20.540 --> 13:24.380
or to try to see why other people play something they don't get for themselves.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.620
I have one friend in particular who tried all of them

13:26.620 --> 13:28.220
and just didn't get them at all,

13:28.220 --> 13:31.900
found them overly esoteric and difficult in a way that wasn't fun

13:31.900 --> 13:35.180
and full of overly defensive, get-good, spouting fanboys

13:35.180 --> 13:37.260
and just not all they were cracked up to be.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.020
But then March 2015 happened.

13:39.660 --> 13:41.020
Then Bloodborne happened.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.260
Like the other games, my friend tried this one expecting to bounce off,

13:47.260 --> 13:48.780
but instead he fell in.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.300
He's played a ton of this game,

13:50.300 --> 13:52.060
and I think it's one of his favorites ever,

13:52.060 --> 13:55.180
at least based on how he seems to have finished it like 12 times or something.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.460
But more importantly,

13:56.460 --> 13:59.260
and this is the impetus behind this whole video, to be honest,

13:59.260 --> 14:02.300
he went back to the other games and finally got them.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.340
All of a sudden, he likes those as well.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.540
And this has happened with a couple of other people too.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.940
Some people just don't get the Souls games,

14:10.940 --> 14:11.820
play Bloodborne,

14:11.820 --> 14:15.900
and then suddenly have this deep and abiding passion for the whole series.

14:15.900 --> 14:20.060
So the main purpose of this video is to try and figure out why exactly that might be.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.620
Let's get down to brass tacks.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.780
Let's dig a little deeper.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.860
Did anyone else think The Princess and the Frog felt kind of like it was phoning it in?

14:35.100 --> 14:38.540
Now I want to get into a rather heated and complex question.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.940
Is it possible to play a game wrong?

14:40.940 --> 14:43.180
I think this is genuinely difficult to answer.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.660
People are going to have different experiences no matter what,

14:45.660 --> 14:47.740
and not everyone has to like something.

14:47.740 --> 14:51.820
But part of me also feels that there are right and wrong ways to approach a game.

14:51.820 --> 14:54.460
But what does that mean for people who want to make good criticism

14:54.460 --> 14:57.020
and attempt to analyze the rights and wrongs of game design

14:57.020 --> 14:59.340
if the results are going to be so subjective anyway?

14:59.340 --> 15:02.620
Does game design even matter if you can create the greatest game ever

15:02.620 --> 15:05.580
but some people will just play it wrong and have a bad time?

15:05.580 --> 15:07.900
Well, to a certain extent, that's always going to happen, isn't it?

15:07.900 --> 15:11.100
There will always be people for whom an experience just isn't for them

15:11.100 --> 15:13.740
or who are too dumb to understand how to play something

15:13.740 --> 15:17.260
or don't realize that something they think is good is objectively bad.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.500
Some people really like Fallout 3,

15:19.500 --> 15:22.140
and they seem to be the specific type of people who think

15:22.140 --> 15:25.500
clicking a dislike button is a decent way of expressing their feelings.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.780
In other words, objectively stupid people like Fallout 3.

15:28.780 --> 15:31.660
And there is a right way to play the Souls games.

15:31.660 --> 15:33.500
You can hide behind the shield a lot,

15:33.500 --> 15:36.060
die over and over trying to memorize every encounter,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.420
or use magic from a distance to avoid having to engage with the game

15:39.420 --> 15:42.300
or wear the heaviest armor and hope that'll save you.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.580
But the reality is it's just more fun playing it as someone who dodges,

15:45.580 --> 15:47.100
who weaves, who parries,

15:47.100 --> 15:50.380
and who uses situational awareness to assess a situation

15:50.380 --> 15:53.420
and maybe get out of it the first time without so much trial or error.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.540
It's not that hard.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.780
The Souls games aren't really all that difficult.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.900
You dodge the attack and then you hit them with the stick.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.380
Done.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.780
I just solved all the Souls games for you.

16:02.780 --> 16:05.660
Everything else is just pretentiousness about preparing to die.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.620
I know, that's stupid.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.660
Ignore all of that.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.740
Oh, you think breathing fire is sexy?

16:09.740 --> 16:11.820
Sorry, that's not in this semester.

16:12.780 --> 16:14.540
I'm gonna have to kick you out of the school.

16:15.660 --> 16:19.340
Is it rude of me to say there's right and wrong ways to have fun with a game?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.900
Well, maybe.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.980
But thanks to the magic of face cam,

16:23.980 --> 16:26.620
I can literally see this in effect.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.180
Here's Patrick Klepek painstakingly muscling his way

16:29.180 --> 16:30.620
through the final boss of Demon's Souls

16:30.620 --> 16:32.940
with his shield raised, a magic shield up,

16:32.940 --> 16:35.100
attacking only when it's utterly safe.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.580
When it's over, he breathes a sigh of relief.

16:37.580 --> 16:51.820
He's glad it's over.

16:51.820 --> 16:54.140
He's glad to be done with the game.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.500
Was that fight fun?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.940
It seemed torturous.

16:56.940 --> 16:59.100
No wonder people think these games aren't for everyone

16:59.100 --> 17:00.540
if this is how they're playing it.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.340
Now, here's Patrick fighting a boss in Dark Souls 2

17:03.340 --> 17:04.860
with no easy magic to help him.

17:04.860 --> 17:06.300
He doesn't even have a shield.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.220
He's dual-wielding maces.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.140
Does he breathe a sigh of relief when it's over?

17:10.860 --> 17:13.260
Well, I just came back and totally whooped the pursuer.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.380
Of course not.

17:18.380 --> 17:22.940
Is Dark Souls 2 such a massively more amazing experience than Demon's Souls,

17:22.940 --> 17:27.420
or was he just playing it in a way that was less conducive to actually enjoying himself?

17:27.420 --> 17:31.820
More importantly, what leads people to play the game one way over the other?

17:31.820 --> 17:33.340
It's a difficult concept to deal with

17:33.340 --> 17:35.900
because it doesn't concern the mechanics of the game itself,

17:35.980 --> 17:38.460
but rather how the game relates its mechanics to the player,

17:38.460 --> 17:39.820
which is far more important

17:39.820 --> 17:43.820
and defines how the player deals with these mechanics over the course of their experience.

17:43.820 --> 17:47.020
I covered this concept briefly in my Fallout 3 analysis,

17:47.020 --> 17:49.900
and I realize in retrospect it was the smartest thing I said.

17:49.900 --> 17:54.220
The first lockpick and hacking scenarios are immediately next to the means to circumvent them,

17:54.220 --> 17:57.660
which accidentally teaches the player not to bother with these mechanics

17:57.660 --> 17:59.180
because there's going to be workarounds

17:59.180 --> 18:01.980
and the time or point investment is better spent elsewhere.

18:01.980 --> 18:05.340
The lockpicking and hacking mechanics themselves are fine in a vacuum,

18:05.340 --> 18:08.940
but you've just hamstrung the player's perception of how they surface in the game.

18:08.940 --> 18:11.580
When you find the password in the dresser next to the computer,

18:11.580 --> 18:12.460
you're not going to go,

18:12.460 --> 18:15.900
oh boy, I can't wait to invest in my character's hacking abilities.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.900
You think, wow, hacking is for idiots.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.420
I'll just look in people's desks.

18:19.420 --> 18:23.100
The lockpicking and hacking mechanics themselves were absolutely fine in my opinion.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.260
They were perfectly acceptable for this kind of game,

18:25.260 --> 18:28.460
but the actual experience of how they're introduced to the player

18:28.460 --> 18:31.660
influences how they behave in their interactions with them,

18:31.660 --> 18:34.300
and thereby alters the amount of fun they can have.

18:34.300 --> 18:38.460
You play games in the manner dictated by the experience of the game itself,

18:38.460 --> 18:40.460
and sometimes that manner isn't great.

18:40.460 --> 18:44.540
Now, I haven't really seen anyone else writing about this psychological side of design,

18:44.540 --> 18:45.740
and believe me, I've looked.

18:45.740 --> 18:49.180
Even Game Feel, Stephen Swink's seminal work on good game design,

18:49.180 --> 18:53.500
seems mostly concerned with making mechanics that look and feel and play well,

18:53.500 --> 18:56.220
but doesn't really consider how a game causes the player

18:56.220 --> 18:58.860
to start engaging with them in a way that's fun.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.460
And since, from the sounds of things,

19:00.460 --> 19:02.860
I'm basically the discoverer of this concept, right,

19:02.940 --> 19:04.460
does that mean I get to name it?

19:04.460 --> 19:08.460
Well, uh, I'm gonna call it Play Conditioning.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.420
Yeah, sure.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.980
If you've got a better name or it turns out there's a large body of work

19:11.980 --> 19:14.060
dealing with this concept already that I just missed,

19:14.060 --> 19:16.620
let me know and I'll go mope in the corner for a while.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.980
This is a little different from a more well-known concept called conveyance,

19:19.980 --> 19:23.740
which is how a game tells you what its mechanics are and what things do.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.740
Play Conditioning, my new made-up term,

19:25.740 --> 19:29.820
refers to how players are led to use those mechanics by how the game is executed.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.780
I might just be splitting hairs to make it look like I came up with a new concept,

19:32.780 --> 19:35.340
but I do feel that there's an important distinction there.

19:35.340 --> 19:39.340
Let's take a look at the conditioning at play in the early levels of Demon's Souls.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.060
The first boss you encounter has an unreasonably high amount of health

19:42.060 --> 19:43.580
and can kill you in either one hit

19:43.580 --> 19:46.620
or one and one-tenths of a hit based on your character.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.100
And once he kills you, you don't get another shot.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.660
You revive in the Nexus where the story properly starts.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.260
But even if you do beat it,

19:53.260 --> 19:55.900
you advance to this dragon and he kills you.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.620
The lesson, no matter what, is you will die.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.260
The game's trying to tell you that you're going to fail sometimes,

20:01.260 --> 20:02.780
so you might want to learn from it.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.940
It's a warning about the game's intense difficulty

20:04.940 --> 20:06.700
and the nature of death in this game.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.260
Embrace that it's possible and build on your mistakes.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.260
The first time I beat the early tutorial enemies

20:11.260 --> 20:14.380
and then pass through the fog door to meet this giant hulking monster

20:14.380 --> 20:16.780
was genuinely kind of surprising and terrifying.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.140
There's this moment of,

20:18.140 --> 20:20.300
oh, shit, it's genius.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.780
Your almost inevitable death at this guy's hand...

20:23.740 --> 20:24.300
things

20:24.300 --> 20:27.980
immediately communicates that you're going to be facing seemingly insurmountable odds,

20:27.980 --> 20:30.780
which makes succeeding against them all the more satisfying.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.780
You run into versions of this boss later in the game

20:32.780 --> 20:35.420
and clowning on them after all the experience and weapons you've gained

20:35.420 --> 20:36.940
is a reminder of how far you've come.

20:36.940 --> 20:40.460
It's pretty good, but getting there requires playing the game for tens more hours,

20:40.460 --> 20:44.380
and that's not a particularly good kind of return on your investment.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.940
Plus, being killed no matter what at the start of a game

20:46.940 --> 20:49.020
isn't exactly all that encouraging either.

20:49.020 --> 20:51.580
It kind of has a negative effect on players, I feel.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.700
Not everyone's going to enjoy being led into the game in this manner.

20:55.340 --> 20:57.980
Okay, first enemy, first boss.

20:57.980 --> 20:58.860
What's up, Vanguard?

21:01.820 --> 21:02.700
Yo.

21:02.700 --> 21:06.620
Do you think this told Patrick he should be fast and frenetic and take more risks?

21:06.620 --> 21:09.180
The first real level also embodies this paradox.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.020
It's a testbed for the sort of tricks and traps

21:11.020 --> 21:13.020
that will be used against you for the rest of the game.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.740
It's probably intended to teach you a lot about the game to come

21:15.740 --> 21:18.220
and prime you to know what to look for and how to act.

21:18.220 --> 21:21.180
This area here has a really obvious enemy just in front of you

21:21.180 --> 21:22.540
that you'll be walking towards,

21:22.620 --> 21:25.180
but there's a guy also hiding just behind the doorway.

21:25.180 --> 21:27.340
Some games don't show you everything easily

21:27.340 --> 21:30.540
because the challenge is to see if you think to look for it.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.380
Countless enemies are going to hide in places

21:32.380 --> 21:35.820
you can't quite see over the course of this game and its successors,

21:35.820 --> 21:38.620
but after this one, you know it can happen,

21:38.620 --> 21:41.100
and the real challenge is dealing with that possibility.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.220
But the problem is,

21:42.220 --> 21:46.060
if all of these ways of showing you the game can kill you do kill you,

21:46.060 --> 21:47.980
it does feel kind of shit.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.500
The game is still really, really good,

21:49.500 --> 21:53.580
but it's hard to imagine a beginner who's just started a Souls game for the first time

21:53.580 --> 21:56.300
opening up, dying to this section a couple of times,

21:56.300 --> 21:57.980
and having a good time doing it.

21:57.980 --> 22:01.740
It's possible that it accidentally imbued players with the lesson,

22:01.740 --> 22:03.100
this isn't fun or fair,

22:03.100 --> 22:05.900
and you should just give up or play it in the most boring possible way

22:05.900 --> 22:07.180
in the hopes you survive.

22:07.180 --> 22:08.540
Patrick played the game wrong

22:08.540 --> 22:12.460
because he was conditioned by the experience to approach it that way.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.540
I have to admit that I played Demon's Souls

22:14.540 --> 22:16.780
after playing the first two Dark Souls games,

22:16.780 --> 22:19.740
so these early sections weren't nearly as excruciating

22:19.740 --> 22:20.860
as they would have been

22:20.860 --> 22:24.380
if this was my first ever engagement with the series and its mechanics.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.460
Dark Souls has this exact problem, too,

22:26.460 --> 22:27.820
but it lessens it somewhat.

22:27.820 --> 22:31.020
You start, fight easy enemies with a broken sword, no problem,

22:31.020 --> 22:32.060
and then BAM!

22:32.060 --> 22:33.180
Asylum Demon.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.900
He's huge, and he probably kills you the first time.

22:35.900 --> 22:39.180
To survive, you have to run past him and through a door to the side,

22:39.180 --> 22:40.460
and then, no joke,

22:40.460 --> 22:43.500
the first thing the game gives you is a shield.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.740
What lesson does this instill to a player?

22:45.740 --> 22:46.540
It says,

22:46.540 --> 22:48.300
hide behind this to survive.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.900
You loop back around and kill the demon

22:49.900 --> 22:52.060
by getting the drop on it and having better weapons.

22:52.060 --> 22:53.980
It's definitely improvement over the Vanguard,

22:53.980 --> 22:56.380
where you get one shot, and then you're done,

22:56.380 --> 22:59.260
because you immediately get the payoff of besting the opponent

22:59.260 --> 23:01.420
who probably beat you at least once,

23:01.420 --> 23:05.020
but by then the game's already kind of told you that shields are the way to go.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.940
So it's not surprising that a lot of early players

23:06.940 --> 23:08.620
run around with their shield up constantly

23:08.620 --> 23:11.900
and don't really play in the kind of active, action-y way

23:11.900 --> 23:14.060
that lends to really enjoying yourself.

23:14.140 --> 23:16.860
You can see this play conditioning in effect with, for example,

23:16.860 --> 23:19.260
Geopp, who Let's Played the game in 2012.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.340
He plays very conservatively and slowly

23:21.340 --> 23:24.140
and has his shield up even when nothing's around just in case.

23:24.140 --> 23:26.540
He's very careful, and it takes him five videos

23:26.540 --> 23:28.460
to get to the bonfire in Undead Burg.

23:28.460 --> 23:30.060
And once he gets his hands on a spear,

23:30.060 --> 23:34.300
he spends a huge portion of the game attacking safely from behind his shield.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.740
In the description of the Let's Play,

23:35.740 --> 23:39.020
he explains that he played a small bit of Demon's Souls before giving up.

23:39.020 --> 23:40.700
In other words, this play style emerges

23:40.700 --> 23:43.260
from when you experience the parts of the first two games

23:43.260 --> 23:47.020
that seemingly condition you to play the game in the most boring way

23:47.020 --> 23:48.300
in order to survive.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.700
Something very telling he does is constantly discuss

23:50.700 --> 23:52.060
when is a good time to heal

23:52.060 --> 23:53.900
because he wants to conserve his flasks.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.380
He learned to treat healing like that in Demon's Souls

23:56.380 --> 23:58.540
where you could literally run out of healing items

23:58.540 --> 24:00.380
and have none and just be screwed.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.380
He takes a little while to fully take on board

24:02.380 --> 24:04.540
on the instinctive level people play games

24:04.540 --> 24:06.940
that wasting some of your Estus isn't a big deal

24:06.940 --> 24:08.380
because it's not gone forever.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.460
In other words, he's actually suffering in Dark Souls

24:10.460 --> 24:14.060
because of the way Demon's Souls taught him to play this kind of game.

24:14.060 --> 24:16.940
Critically, the entire Souls series, even Demon's Souls,

24:16.940 --> 24:18.140
have done quite well,

24:18.140 --> 24:20.620
but plenty of players didn't like Demon's Souls

24:20.620 --> 24:22.300
and a few critics did agree with them.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.420
Take, for example, Yahtzee,

24:23.420 --> 24:27.340
everyone's favorite fast-talking English sweary man

24:27.340 --> 24:29.020
who I'm not jealous of at all.

24:29.020 --> 24:29.980
So in conclusion,

24:29.980 --> 24:31.260
fuck you, Demon's Souls.

24:31.260 --> 24:32.300
A challenge is one thing,

24:32.300 --> 24:34.780
but trying to break down a fucking cement wall with your forehead

24:34.780 --> 24:35.340
isn't a challenge,

24:35.340 --> 24:37.260
it's grounds for getting fucking sectioned.

24:37.260 --> 24:40.220
That's a pretty emphatic no to what Demon's Souls is doing,

24:40.700 --> 24:43.820
I remember people on forums at the time echoing his feelings about it.

24:43.820 --> 24:44.780
It's trial and error,

24:44.780 --> 24:46.460
the combat is too punishing,

24:46.460 --> 24:48.140
it feels overly hard,

24:48.140 --> 24:49.980
you have to take it slow to do well,

24:49.980 --> 24:51.580
and that just isn't fun and so on.

24:51.580 --> 24:53.180
At this point, it's worth mentioning that,

24:53.180 --> 24:55.420
yeah, Dark Souls did gangbusters.

24:55.420 --> 24:58.460
It got super popular and had a massively committed following

24:58.460 --> 25:01.340
many times the size of the one Demon's Souls ended up with,

25:01.340 --> 25:03.340
and even Yahtzee came around on it.

25:03.340 --> 25:04.700
But hang on a second.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.100
Let's check out why.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.860
After watching a decent let's play of the game,

25:08.860 --> 25:09.980
gone over the wiki a few times,

25:09.980 --> 25:12.540
and a six-week preparation with a team of advisors and physical trainers,

25:12.540 --> 25:14.060
I was able to break through the wall.

25:14.060 --> 25:16.060
And I suppose that's the first failing of Dark Souls,

25:16.060 --> 25:18.300
that you need the fucking Cliff's Notes to get into it.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.620
It's hard to recommend a game to someone and say,

25:20.620 --> 25:23.260
but first, here's all the research you have to do.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.860
Because that person's gonna say,

25:24.860 --> 25:27.500
you know, you say this game's more fun than Zelda H-Bomb,

25:27.500 --> 25:30.380
but Zelda doesn't require me to read any technical manuals

25:30.380 --> 25:31.820
or peer-reviewed journals

25:31.820 --> 25:34.380
and watch someone else play it for a few hours first.

25:34.380 --> 25:35.900
This doesn't mean the game is bad.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.980
Dark Souls is a very fun video game,

25:37.980 --> 25:39.980
I hope that goes without saying at this point,

25:39.980 --> 25:43.340
but that's a heck of a barrier for entry into that fun, isn't it?

25:43.340 --> 25:45.660
I'm gonna quickly list the reasons why Dark Souls

25:45.660 --> 25:47.500
does better conditioning than Demon's Souls

25:47.500 --> 25:51.180
and helped onboard just enough people for it to get the popularity it did.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.420
Firstly, the opening I told you about before.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.100
You get killed by the Asylum Demon,

25:55.100 --> 25:56.940
but you respawn just outside.

25:56.940 --> 25:58.460
The rematch is immediate.

25:58.460 --> 26:01.980
Instead of being killed and starting with a sense of loss and failure

26:01.980 --> 26:03.500
as the beginning of the game,

26:03.500 --> 26:06.540
the player is killed, but then gets to take their revenge.

26:06.620 --> 26:10.300
Losing, trying again, and winning becomes the expectation

26:10.300 --> 26:12.380
instead of, you know, losing.

26:12.380 --> 26:15.340
Secondly, there's loads of great quality-of-life improvements.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.220
Being hollow, the equivalent of a spirit in Demon's Souls,

26:18.220 --> 26:19.820
no longer halves your life.

26:19.820 --> 26:23.660
Demon's Souls was made much harder if you ever died and lost your human body,

26:23.660 --> 26:25.500
so the player was punished for failure

26:25.500 --> 26:28.940
by making it easier to fail until they get a human form back,

26:28.940 --> 26:31.340
which is quite a rare occurrence in that game.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.940
In Dark Souls, you have the same health

26:32.940 --> 26:36.540
and you're free to not feel like you already fucked yourself by dying.

26:36.540 --> 26:40.540
So, you have less to lose, so you take more risks and do better.

26:40.540 --> 26:42.140
Also, the Estus Flask.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.700
You had a finite amount of healing in Demon's Souls.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.700
You either found healing items in the world

26:46.700 --> 26:49.500
or bought them using souls, which were quite hard-earned.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.340
Using one meant it was gone.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.660
This made deciding to heal feel risky.

26:53.660 --> 26:57.820
Like, if you die now, you basically wasted that healing you just used.

26:57.820 --> 26:59.660
This made players less likely to heal,

26:59.660 --> 27:02.700
which meant they died more, which meant they had less fun.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.980
You could farm souls to buy more, but you know what isn't fun?

27:06.780 --> 27:10.300
Farming items just to have enough stuff to get a proper run at the boss.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.340
The Estus Flask regenerates every time you die,

27:13.340 --> 27:16.860
meaning you never feel like you're actually wasting it because it'll come back.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.660
This made players more willing to use their healing item,

27:19.660 --> 27:23.180
which made them live longer and do better and have more fun.

27:23.180 --> 27:25.100
Those were the main two, in my opinion.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.260
There are more, but they're not really worth bringing up here.

27:27.260 --> 27:29.740
If I were making a game with Demon's Souls as system of health,

27:29.740 --> 27:32.940
I would have made your life bar and soul form your actual life bar

27:32.940 --> 27:35.020
and have your health double when you were human,

27:35.020 --> 27:37.260
so being human at least felt like a buff

27:37.260 --> 27:41.900
instead of simply being able to use all of your health bar for a while.

27:41.900 --> 27:46.460
My third reason why Dark Souls feels better is the existence of Demon's Souls itself.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.780
I know it's a bit weird, but I think my reasoning is sound.

27:48.780 --> 27:53.020
Demon's Souls felt to players like this weird new thing that did stuff differently,

27:53.020 --> 27:55.900
and different doesn't always feel good to play.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.980
Some aspects felt like active mistakes.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.460
Why would they make the game this punishing and hard?

28:00.460 --> 28:03.340
Why were there so many weird traps trying to directly kill me?

28:03.340 --> 28:04.300
And so on.

28:04.300 --> 28:09.180
Dark Souls, by being the second in a series, is viewed differently by its players.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.700
Now all the weirdness and differentness and difficulty are justifiable.

28:12.700 --> 28:16.620
The fact they did it twice makes it feel like, no, this is all just intentional.

28:16.620 --> 28:21.260
Suddenly, bad ideas and weird concepts simply become staples of a series.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.620
For a movie example, The Purge had to justify its very existence

28:24.620 --> 28:27.580
and its concept to a fresh audience when it came out.

28:27.660 --> 28:32.220
But The Purge 2 and 3 didn't, because they were the second and third stories in a series.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.780
So even if The Purge 1 is worse than the others,

28:34.780 --> 28:35.580
which, yeah...

28:39.900 --> 28:44.860
It's worth keeping in mind that it did receive a different critical perspective than its sequels did.

28:44.860 --> 28:47.180
Dark Souls has slightly better play conditioning,

28:47.180 --> 28:49.980
but it's still quite clearly not that great at it.

28:49.980 --> 28:52.780
So it isn't just that Bloodborne is a better game than the others,

28:52.780 --> 28:54.780
although that is kinda true in my opinion,

28:54.780 --> 28:58.620
Bloodborne changes people's perspectives on a more subtle level.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.540
I have a theory about this ga-

29:00.540 --> 29:03.100
No, I have a hypothesis about this game.

29:03.660 --> 29:07.100
Bloodborne teaches you how to enjoy Souls games.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.700
Let me show you just a couple of the design differences that seem small,

29:10.700 --> 29:14.220
but have a massive, MASSIVE difference on the mindset of players.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.740
Firstly, the most obvious one.

29:17.660 --> 29:18.940
There's no shield.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.380
Where is it? It's not there!

29:20.380 --> 29:22.060
This isn't how these games work!

29:22.060 --> 29:25.020
You don't start the game with a shield at all, no matter what.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.220
This is genius!

29:26.220 --> 29:26.720
This is...

29:27.500 --> 29:30.300
It's a spicy meatball of game design goodness!

29:30.300 --> 29:31.820
Normally food metaphors are bad,

29:31.820 --> 29:35.260
but I can literally taste the design genius here.

29:35.260 --> 29:38.860
The shield has been the bane of the Souls series from the very start.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.460
It's the true villain,

29:40.460 --> 29:43.420
and it's precisely because of its function and use.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.060
Let's go back.

29:44.060 --> 29:51.980
Ah, the shield. A classic.

29:51.980 --> 29:55.660
You hold a button down and you're immediately protected from obvious harm you're facing.

29:55.660 --> 29:56.940
There's a parry mechanic,

29:56.940 --> 30:01.020
which you can use to make an enemy completely exposed and hit them for way more damage.

30:01.020 --> 30:02.300
But why take the risk?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.740
You can just block the attack,

30:03.740 --> 30:05.340
and then attack when there's an opening.

30:05.340 --> 30:06.060
Just wait!

30:06.060 --> 30:07.180
You can do a dodge roll,

30:07.180 --> 30:09.660
but you're only immune to getting hit for a few frames.

30:09.660 --> 30:11.980
Why bother when you can just stand there and be fine?

30:11.980 --> 30:13.340
This game's not so hard.

30:13.340 --> 30:14.540
Just hold the shield button.

30:15.260 --> 30:17.580
Welcome to having a shitty time.

30:17.580 --> 30:21.500
The fun, frenetic dodge mechanic and the incredibly engaging parry stuff

30:21.500 --> 30:24.700
is immediately foreclosed by a much safer option.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.220
Not necessarily better,

30:26.220 --> 30:28.380
but for early players, safer.

30:28.380 --> 30:31.580
A good deal of players will spend a lot of time with their shield up,

30:31.580 --> 30:32.780
playing it safe,

30:32.780 --> 30:35.420
waiting for only the best possible moment to drop it,

30:35.420 --> 30:36.060
strike,

30:36.060 --> 30:37.500
and then bring it back up again.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.820
The shields only get bigger and more defend-y.

30:39.820 --> 30:44.060
They seem to actively encourage using one more rather than less over time.

30:44.060 --> 30:46.620
One reason why early players gravitate towards spears

30:46.620 --> 30:49.740
is because you can even use them while the shield is up.

30:49.740 --> 30:52.220
It's encouraging the players to turtle up,

30:52.220 --> 30:53.580
play very, very slowly,

30:53.580 --> 30:55.740
and just not have a good time.

30:55.740 --> 30:58.940
This is one major reason why people don't enjoy these games.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.540
They tell you you're going to die a lot,

31:00.540 --> 31:02.860
and then hand you a means of protecting yourself,

31:02.860 --> 31:04.860
and the immediate assumption is that you should,

31:04.860 --> 31:05.500
you know,

31:05.500 --> 31:06.220
use it.

31:06.220 --> 31:08.620
But it makes for boring, slow play.

31:08.620 --> 31:10.220
You could try parrying,

31:10.220 --> 31:13.660
or just put the shield away and have fun using the other options available to you,

31:13.660 --> 31:15.260
like two-handing the sword,

31:15.260 --> 31:18.220
but the game doesn't really seem to encourage doing it, does it?

31:18.220 --> 31:20.620
No shield means no one is safe.

31:20.620 --> 31:21.900
You have to dodge,

31:21.900 --> 31:23.820
and your offhand weapon is now a gun

31:23.820 --> 31:25.100
whose sole use,

31:25.100 --> 31:27.260
unless you spec your character a specific way,

31:27.260 --> 31:28.620
is for parrying.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.260
Parry,

31:29.260 --> 31:30.140
or dodge,

31:30.140 --> 31:31.100
or die.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.660
No easy, boring path at all.

31:33.660 --> 31:35.260
You now have no choice

31:35.260 --> 31:37.260
but to play the game the fun way.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.100
Welcome to the fun zone.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.500
I just, I, I can't believe it.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.000
Like,

31:43.180 --> 31:44.940
can you imagine being in the room

31:44.940 --> 31:49.340
when Hit Attacker Miyazaki was looking at playtest footage of the previous games,

31:49.340 --> 31:51.500
and coming up with the concept for Bloodborne,

31:51.500 --> 31:52.220
and he was like,

31:52.220 --> 31:52.940
hey,

31:52.940 --> 31:53.440
hey,

31:54.060 --> 31:54.940
take out the shields.

31:55.660 --> 31:56.160
Like,

31:56.540 --> 31:57.040
what?

31:57.580 --> 31:58.460
Nani?!

31:58.460 --> 31:59.500
Hit Attacker?!

31:59.500 --> 32:01.740
How will people defend themselves?

32:01.740 --> 32:05.180
By learning to play the game in a way that's actually fun, mate.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.700
That's how Japanese people talk,

32:06.700 --> 32:08.220
with that exact accent.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.580
No shields, ever.

32:09.580 --> 32:10.080
None.

32:10.540 --> 32:11.500
Okay, one shield,

32:11.500 --> 32:12.540
but it's a joke.

32:12.540 --> 32:16.300
Put a joke in the arm description about them engendering passivity.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.020
Passivity.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.460
God, I can't do this voice.

32:18.460 --> 32:18.940
Sorry.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.980
Broad strokes, let's think about what lesson these games teach you.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.140
Demon's Souls hands you a sword and shield,

32:24.140 --> 32:25.420
and then kills you,

32:25.420 --> 32:27.340
and tells you you're going to die a lot.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.420
Dark Souls kills you,

32:29.420 --> 32:30.620
and hands you a shield.

32:31.180 --> 32:32.540
Bloodborne kills you,

32:32.540 --> 32:33.980
and hands you a blade,

32:33.980 --> 32:34.860
and a gun.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.740
It's commonly said that the best defense is a good offense,

32:37.740 --> 32:41.100
and while I'm currently on trial for taking that concept too seriously,

32:41.100 --> 32:42.700
it's certainly true here.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.620
It's just genius.

32:44.620 --> 32:47.260
It's always been possible to play without a shield.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.220
Two-handing a weapon,

32:48.220 --> 32:48.780
or dodging,

32:48.780 --> 32:49.420
or parrying,

32:49.420 --> 32:50.860
has always been viable,

32:50.860 --> 32:53.740
and always been more fun and fluid than using the shield,

32:53.740 --> 32:56.620
but they're just harder enough compared to putting the shield up

32:56.620 --> 32:58.460
that most people don't want to take the risk,

32:58.460 --> 33:00.860
and thus end up playing the whole game like this.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.860
At which point, how far you get through these games

33:02.860 --> 33:06.620
becomes a question of how committed you are to being bored,

33:06.620 --> 33:08.700
and there are people who've always played the games like this,

33:08.700 --> 33:10.460
but they tend to have needed a long time

33:10.460 --> 33:13.180
to figure out this style of play and really get into it.

33:13.180 --> 33:14.460
By removing shields,

33:14.460 --> 33:18.060
players are funneled into that particular play style far quicker,

33:18.060 --> 33:19.580
and what's magical about this

33:19.580 --> 33:22.380
is that this mindset carries over to the previous games.

33:22.380 --> 33:25.580
The incredible potential of the series is made available to people

33:25.580 --> 33:28.220
without the need to figure out that play style for themselves

33:28.220 --> 33:30.620
by investing tons of time into an experience

33:30.620 --> 33:32.780
that starts out feeling kind of plodding.

33:32.780 --> 33:36.540
This is one reason why the early Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 community

33:36.540 --> 33:38.700
seems so hardcore and committed,

33:38.700 --> 33:40.700
because previously, the only sort of person

33:40.700 --> 33:43.420
who would stick with early Demon's Souls or Dark Souls

33:43.420 --> 33:46.060
long enough to get to the place where it's actually fun

33:46.060 --> 33:49.020
is the kind of person who's willing to invest a lot of time

33:49.020 --> 33:51.820
into something that starts out not all that fun,

33:51.820 --> 33:54.220
and that takes a certain type of person.

33:54.220 --> 33:57.580
The early fan base of the Souls series is a bunch of weirdos

33:57.580 --> 34:01.340
because that's the only type of person the series could attract early on.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.620
No offense intended here.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.700
I'm one of those people, okay?

34:04.700 --> 34:06.060
I'm just being self-aware.

34:06.060 --> 34:08.780
Without making the experience all that much easier,

34:08.780 --> 34:12.540
in fact, by making it harder by taking the shield out,

34:12.540 --> 34:16.140
Bloodborne opens up the fun way of experiencing this type of game

34:16.140 --> 34:17.340
to more people,

34:17.340 --> 34:19.740
and that's just magical, isn't it?

34:19.740 --> 34:20.620
Don't you think?

34:20.620 --> 34:22.620
I'm still reeling from it, to be honest.

34:22.620 --> 34:26.940
Like, what level of genius does a man have to be operating on

34:26.940 --> 34:28.140
to be able to go,

34:28.140 --> 34:29.580
okay, I've thought about it,

34:29.580 --> 34:33.020
and by removing a key aspect of our game series,

34:33.020 --> 34:35.180
we're gonna vastly improve the experience,

34:35.180 --> 34:36.460
not just of this game,

34:36.460 --> 34:38.380
but of all the previous ones,

34:38.380 --> 34:40.540
because people will go back and play them that way

34:40.540 --> 34:42.460
and have a fucking great time!

34:42.460 --> 34:44.300
Like, oh my god!

34:44.300 --> 34:45.980
Isn't- I- I'm sorry.

34:45.980 --> 34:48.380
I try not to, like, screech too much in my videos anymore.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.740
People- people say it sounds fake,

34:49.740 --> 34:51.420
even though that is actually just how I talk,

34:52.380 --> 34:53.740
but I just can't not.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.940
It's- it's so brilliant.

34:58.940 --> 35:00.940
Woo!

35:00.940 --> 35:02.860
One in, done.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.140
Praise the mace.

35:04.140 --> 35:07.340
Now, I don't know which Patrick you'd vote for president of the school council,

35:07.340 --> 35:09.020
but I already cast my vote early.

35:09.020 --> 35:12.860
I have a- a mail-in vote to the- the vidi- video game school.

35:12.860 --> 35:16.700
Complementing this just genius system is rallying.

35:16.700 --> 35:20.140
If you get hit, that section of lost health lingers there for a while,

35:20.140 --> 35:23.020
and you get some of that health back if you hit an enemy.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.980
You can theoretically get it all back almost every time.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.860
This feels, at first, like a simple gimmick, right?

35:28.860 --> 35:33.180
But think about how it impacts the player's sense as they play the game.

35:33.180 --> 35:36.460
Now when you get hit, you don't immediately think to back off and heal

35:36.460 --> 35:38.620
and just break the flow of the combat.

35:38.620 --> 35:41.420
In every Souls game before that, that's the reaction.

35:41.420 --> 35:43.100
Now you can keep going.

35:43.100 --> 35:46.620
You can take your health back from the guy who hit you.

35:46.620 --> 35:47.900
Bloody blimey!

35:47.900 --> 35:52.460
Like, now you always have the option of being a little more vicious and getting away with it.

35:52.460 --> 35:56.460
It's hugely impactful on the flow and action of combat.

35:56.460 --> 35:59.980
Combined with the loss of shields, you're carefully encouraged into a mindset

35:59.980 --> 36:06.940
that's just more aggressive and tactile and fun and more big, fun-sounding words.

36:06.940 --> 36:08.860
It's not even a huge difference, is it?

36:08.860 --> 36:13.500
But it results in an improved approach to combat that's more satisfying for players

36:13.500 --> 36:17.660
and which, like not using a shield, carries back over to the previous games.

36:17.660 --> 36:21.580
Bloodborne at times feels like a tutorial for how to play the previous ones

36:21.580 --> 36:23.900
because even when you take rallying out,

36:23.900 --> 36:27.500
killing an enemy before healing is generally a smarter option anyway.

36:27.500 --> 36:31.580
You've been forced to get good the way people used to have to be obnoxious

36:31.580 --> 36:34.220
and hammer away for hundreds of hours to achieve.

36:34.220 --> 36:38.300
The developers of Bloodborne didn't blame players for playing it badly.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.860
They blamed the game, and then they fixed it.

36:44.460 --> 36:48.540
The other way players subtly influenced is the slight change in the way weapons work.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.300
Quick weapons feel responsive and larger weapons feel slower and more deliberate,

36:52.300 --> 36:55.980
but there's a genuine sense of weight and power when you pull them off.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.980
But the edges have been rough at times.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.540
The biggest problem has been the array of weapons available.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.260
There are, in my opinion, a bit too many.

37:03.260 --> 37:05.500
There's a bunch of different kinds of sword,

37:05.500 --> 37:08.620
all with slightly different or majorly different animations.

37:08.620 --> 37:12.140
Maces, rapiers, spears, greatswords, ultra greatswords,

37:12.140 --> 37:14.780
ridiculous fuck-off big berserk reference swords,

37:14.780 --> 37:18.620
battle axes, hand axes, stupid axes, and so on.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.380
The variety initially seems fine,

37:20.380 --> 37:22.780
but in practice it means you have to figure out and remember

37:22.780 --> 37:25.260
dozens of different timings and animations and ranges

37:25.260 --> 37:27.580
for both one-handing and two-handing all these weapons

37:27.580 --> 37:30.940
in order to know which you prefer or which one is best for each scenario.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.020
It's not particularly inviting to players,

37:33.020 --> 37:37.100
and did we really need three very similar versions of the same moveset

37:37.100 --> 37:39.820
when one would have had more clarity and been less cluttered?

37:39.820 --> 37:43.180
Did we really need a bastard sword and a claymore?

37:43.180 --> 37:46.780
Bloodborne solves this handily from, like, eight different directions at once.

37:46.780 --> 37:49.980
Firstly, there's nowhere near as many weapons, but all of them are unique.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.780
There are variations, like the saw cleaver has the saw spear

37:52.780 --> 37:55.020
and the Kirkhammer has Ludwig's holy blade,

37:55.020 --> 37:56.780
but even they feel different enough.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.540
But they don't make you feel like you've lost out

37:58.540 --> 38:00.940
on tons of variations you could have experimented with

38:00.940 --> 38:03.100
because the weapons all have alternative forms

38:03.100 --> 38:05.900
that increase the versatility of each individual weapon

38:05.900 --> 38:07.980
and even give you moves that let you switch between them

38:07.980 --> 38:09.900
as you're attacking, which is really cool.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.300
Every weapon has an amazing amount of moves and uses,

38:12.300 --> 38:13.740
but you're never overwhelmed

38:13.740 --> 38:17.340
because no weapon is clearly worse or better than any other anymore.

38:17.340 --> 38:19.100
I'm looking at you, sword that you get

38:19.100 --> 38:21.020
that's the same moveset as a starting sword

38:21.020 --> 38:22.780
but is just better for no reason.

38:22.780 --> 38:25.100
There's no longer a really obviously better version

38:25.100 --> 38:26.620
of the weapon you were already using

38:26.620 --> 38:30.140
you now have to switch to later on because it's underleveled.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.780
But overall, these changes gently coax players

38:32.780 --> 38:35.180
into feeling like the choice they made is valid

38:35.180 --> 38:38.620
instead of living in constant fear that they're hamstringing themselves.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.020
The saw cleaver can be your endgame weapon,

38:41.020 --> 38:43.340
and you can become intimately knowledgeable with its use

38:43.340 --> 38:46.300
and never have to worry if you should actually be using something else

38:46.300 --> 38:48.380
and the weapons are unique and varied enough

38:48.380 --> 38:51.500
that they never feel samey even if you use them for the whole game.

38:51.500 --> 38:54.140
If you really like generic swords, there's one in there.

38:54.140 --> 38:56.860
It just happens to be able to turn into a cool weapon.

38:56.860 --> 39:00.060
The downsides of each weapon are almost always clear and understandable.

39:00.060 --> 39:02.620
You know, the Kirkhammer's huge but a bit slow.

39:02.620 --> 39:06.300
The sword cane is really quick and has a whip state that has a huge range

39:06.300 --> 39:08.140
but it doesn't deal all that much damage.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.500
Okay, there is one thing.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.740
The Tornatrus is weird.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.100
It's actually my favorite weapon.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.180
Its alternate form is it doesn't have one.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.180
It just becomes briefly electric.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.100
It's generally pretty strong and fast

39:19.100 --> 39:22.860
and knowing when to take the time to electrify it for even more damage is great.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.780
Its downside is really silly though.

39:24.780 --> 39:28.140
It has a low durability and it goes down quicker than normal weapons

39:28.140 --> 39:29.820
meaning you have to repair it more often

39:29.820 --> 39:32.300
by returning to the hunter's dream and fixing it up.

39:32.300 --> 39:36.300
But it doesn't deteriorate that quickly and repairing costs next to nothing.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.660
It's at worst a hassle.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.500
That's not really much of a downside.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.540
I get that it's trying to make it a weapon you have to use sparingly.

39:42.540 --> 39:43.900
I think that's a neat idea.

39:43.900 --> 39:47.660
But in practice, it doesn't lose durability fast enough to be a major issue

39:47.660 --> 39:50.460
and it's annoying to go to fix when it does get low.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.860
Dark Souls 2 actually had a better system

39:52.860 --> 39:55.500
where resting at a bonfire restored your weapons each time

39:55.500 --> 39:57.340
and durability was lower all round.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.740
So you really did have to take that into consideration

39:59.740 --> 40:03.500
and some weapons really could only be used sparingly during a single run.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.220
Instead of with the Tornatrus, which is basically a really good weapon,

40:06.220 --> 40:08.140
you have to repair a bit more than usual,

40:08.140 --> 40:10.460
which is just not a huge downside.

40:10.460 --> 40:11.820
I think this would have been even better

40:11.820 --> 40:13.660
if they'd ripped off Dark Souls 2 a little more

40:13.660 --> 40:16.700
and had durability that comes back when you die every time

40:16.700 --> 40:18.140
but goes down even faster

40:18.140 --> 40:19.980
so you really did have to pick the times

40:19.980 --> 40:22.860
to pull out the Funtime Electric murder death stick.

40:22.860 --> 40:27.180
I think maybe the over-the-top dislike some fans exhibited towards Dark Souls 2

40:27.180 --> 40:30.700
caused the developers to walk back on ideas that were genuinely better.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.380
Okay, I—I—I—I—

40:32.380 --> 40:35.660
I could spend a good deal of this video defending Dark Souls 2.

40:35.660 --> 40:41.180
In fact, um, I—like half of the script is me doing that

40:41.180 --> 40:44.220
but I do have some sense of when a video is getting to be too much

40:44.220 --> 40:45.900
so I've cut all those bits out

40:45.900 --> 40:49.420
and I'm gonna compile a video looking at the central complaints about it

40:50.460 --> 40:53.740
and why all of them are wrong and lies from criminals

40:53.740 --> 40:56.860
and I'm gonna put that up in a separate video a bit later on.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.780
When that comes up, I'll put the link here.

40:58.780 --> 40:59.980
So, okay, cool.

41:00.860 --> 41:01.980
Back to Bloodborne.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.620
While I have already talked about how great the weapons

41:04.620 --> 41:06.940
have always generally felt in Souls games,

41:06.940 --> 41:11.420
a couple of attacks and moves still felt just a little bit like traps.

41:11.420 --> 41:14.140
Moves you really should not use under any circumstances

41:14.140 --> 41:16.620
because you'll never be in a position where they're actually useful

41:16.620 --> 41:17.900
or they're just ridiculous.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.340
Especially with the larger weapons

41:19.340 --> 41:22.140
and the second or third moves of their heavier attack strings.

41:22.140 --> 41:25.820
The second heavy swing of the two-handed dark blade is a honeypot,

41:25.820 --> 41:29.180
a sexy, powerful trap designed to bait you into being killed

41:29.180 --> 41:31.100
for attempting to actually use it.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.740
Almost every weapon has multiple swings for its R2

41:33.740 --> 41:34.940
even if it shouldn't

41:34.940 --> 41:39.580
because how often is that attack gonna get the chance to go off in this action game?

41:39.580 --> 41:42.700
Giving players that option will cause them to try and use it

41:42.700 --> 41:45.740
and suffer the consequences in a way that doesn't really feel fun.

41:45.740 --> 41:49.180
Giving the players the option to do this is inviting them to get killed.

41:49.180 --> 41:51.580
Bloodborne makes a lot of subtle changes here.

41:51.580 --> 41:54.940
Firstly, the R2 is no longer an attack with second or third swings.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.340
It's very definitively just a single move.

41:57.340 --> 42:01.100
It takes away the inherent tension of not knowing if you should be mashing R1

42:01.100 --> 42:04.540
or doing the strong but slower ones and seeing how many you can get in.

42:04.540 --> 42:07.660
It makes it immediately intuitive that you should be doing the quicker attacks

42:07.660 --> 42:09.180
and finishing with the strong one

42:09.180 --> 42:12.300
or using it when you know a great place for its particular timing.

42:12.300 --> 42:15.020
This moveset is slightly more limited than the previous games

42:15.020 --> 42:16.060
but in a way that's good

42:16.060 --> 42:17.900
because it means players aren't getting bogged down

42:17.900 --> 42:19.660
by moves that are actually useless

42:19.660 --> 42:23.180
but beg you to keep using them because you technically can use them.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.100
So even though you can only do one,

42:25.100 --> 42:26.220
if you're given a big window,

42:26.220 --> 42:28.940
you can still maximize damage with it by charging it up.

42:28.940 --> 42:31.580
However, quick weapons or weapons with different properties

42:31.580 --> 42:33.260
aren't hamstrung by this.

42:33.260 --> 42:35.740
The whip function of the sword cane doesn't charge

42:35.740 --> 42:37.740
and can combo into a second move

42:37.740 --> 42:39.420
because as a relatively quick weapon,

42:39.420 --> 42:41.580
the idea of doing more than one attack with it

42:41.580 --> 42:42.940
isn't inherently a trap.

42:42.940 --> 42:44.300
A cute extra thing I've noticed

42:44.300 --> 42:46.060
is that with the really heavy weapon,

42:46.060 --> 42:47.580
there is a second R2.

42:47.580 --> 42:49.820
If you fully charge Ludwig's Holy Blade,

42:49.820 --> 42:52.220
there's a second attack that can come out after

42:52.220 --> 42:54.220
but only if you fully charged it.

42:54.220 --> 42:55.900
I like this move because it's an acknowledgement

42:55.900 --> 42:56.780
that if you're in a position

42:56.780 --> 42:59.820
where you just fully charged a very slow and deliberate attack

42:59.820 --> 43:01.500
and you did just hit someone with it,

43:01.500 --> 43:02.780
you're probably in a position

43:02.780 --> 43:04.380
where you might as well have access

43:04.380 --> 43:06.300
to another slow but powerful move.

43:06.300 --> 43:07.260
To my recollection,

43:07.260 --> 43:09.260
this is the only weapon with this property.

43:09.260 --> 43:10.380
It's really cool.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.620
The fully charged R2 is so strong already

43:12.620 --> 43:15.420
that it also usually staggers whoever was coming for you.

43:15.420 --> 43:17.580
So that second attack is basically a reward

43:17.580 --> 43:20.300
for mastering one of the most careful moves in the game.

43:20.300 --> 43:22.700
It's also worth mentioning that the weapon upgrade system

43:22.700 --> 43:24.540
is no longer a horrifying nightmare

43:24.540 --> 43:27.660
where you can make a weapon into a crushing weapon

43:27.660 --> 43:30.140
or a fire weapon or poison or magic

43:30.140 --> 43:31.340
or an enchanted weapon.

43:31.340 --> 43:34.060
Yes, those are both different things in the same game.

43:34.060 --> 43:35.660
Or a crystal weapon?

43:35.660 --> 43:38.300
Or a mundane weapon?

43:38.300 --> 43:40.460
A dark weapon?

43:40.460 --> 43:43.660
Half of these options will actively ruin your weapon

43:43.660 --> 43:45.900
unless you've built your character a certain way,

43:45.900 --> 43:48.780
and the resources you expend doing this are rare enough

43:48.780 --> 43:50.700
that you can't afford to waste them.

43:50.700 --> 43:53.820
I get nervous whenever I'm at a weapon upgrade screen

43:53.900 --> 43:56.860
in a Souls game, and that's maybe not great.

43:56.860 --> 43:58.780
Bloodborne keeps the straightforward aspects

43:58.780 --> 43:59.580
of the upgrade path.

43:59.580 --> 44:01.740
You spend blood echoes and bloodstone shards

44:01.740 --> 44:04.620
to make your weapon just generally better and bloodier.

44:04.620 --> 44:06.780
But there are also gems that you can put on a weapon

44:06.780 --> 44:07.980
to change its properties,

44:07.980 --> 44:09.820
but they explain what they do in simple,

44:09.820 --> 44:11.340
easy-to-understand ways,

44:11.340 --> 44:13.020
and they can just be taken out.

44:13.020 --> 44:14.780
So experimentation with weapons

44:14.780 --> 44:17.020
is actively encouraged for once.

44:17.020 --> 44:18.540
This relatively simple change

44:18.540 --> 44:21.100
makes the whole game feel a lot more inviting.

44:21.100 --> 44:23.820
You know you aren't going to render a weapon unusable

44:23.820 --> 44:26.540
or waste one of the two or three magic stone upgrade things

44:26.540 --> 44:28.140
you'll get in the space of playing,

44:28.140 --> 44:30.860
and that makes you more willing to experiment and mess about,

44:30.860 --> 44:34.220
and that just—it just feels better in a big way.

44:34.220 --> 44:36.700
On top of this, the designs of the enemies you fight

44:36.700 --> 44:38.060
have themselves been altered

44:38.060 --> 44:40.540
to force you to play the game in a more fun manner.

44:40.540 --> 44:41.900
Here are some of the generic enemies

44:41.900 --> 44:42.940
from the previous games.

44:42.940 --> 44:45.500
They like to attack a very specific, simple way.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.380
They walk up to you,

44:46.380 --> 44:48.700
and then they engage a rather simple attack.

44:48.700 --> 44:50.700
More importantly, when they're done approaching you,

44:50.700 --> 44:52.300
they kind of stop moving.

44:52.300 --> 44:53.820
Dodging backwards is an effective way

44:53.820 --> 44:54.700
to get out of their range

44:54.700 --> 44:56.620
and free up some time and distance.

44:56.620 --> 44:58.700
Lots of bosses behave like this as well.

44:58.700 --> 45:00.380
Get out of their range while they're attacking you,

45:00.380 --> 45:02.380
and you're in a safe zone of sorts.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.980
Fast forward to Bloodborne.

45:03.980 --> 45:05.580
Most enemies move very differently

45:05.580 --> 45:07.660
in an arguably more realistic manner.

45:07.660 --> 45:09.500
When even early enemies attack,

45:09.500 --> 45:11.260
they continue moving forward,

45:11.260 --> 45:12.860
stumble ahead and stuff.

45:12.860 --> 45:14.940
Dodging backwards as early as the main area

45:14.940 --> 45:16.300
is a recipe for danger.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.580
The game immediately tells you

45:17.580 --> 45:18.700
that you have to think harder

45:18.700 --> 45:20.460
about how you're dealing with these attacks.

45:20.460 --> 45:22.460
The second boss most people encounter,

45:22.460 --> 45:25.260
Gascoigne, is intensely good at this.

45:25.260 --> 45:26.540
Both versions of this fight,

45:26.540 --> 45:29.100
both before and after he transforms into a monster,

45:29.100 --> 45:30.620
have attacks where dodging backwards

45:30.620 --> 45:32.780
leaves you primed to be attacked again.

45:32.780 --> 45:33.660
In monster form,

45:33.660 --> 45:36.540
almost all of his attacks launch him further forward.

45:36.540 --> 45:38.220
The only way to succeed against this guy

45:38.220 --> 45:39.580
is to get good at parrying him

45:39.580 --> 45:41.340
or learn to dodge to the side

45:41.340 --> 45:43.740
or even forward through his attacks

45:43.740 --> 45:45.340
with your momentary invincibility

45:45.340 --> 45:46.860
to get in a strike of your own.

45:46.860 --> 45:48.620
Or you could keep trying to dodge backwards

45:48.620 --> 45:50.780
and complain that the game doesn't let you escape.

45:50.780 --> 45:52.300
My first few attempts at Gascoigne

45:52.300 --> 45:54.540
were the least fun I'd had in the series

45:54.540 --> 45:56.460
because, as someone who regards themselves

45:56.460 --> 45:57.820
as a seasoned Souls player

45:57.820 --> 46:00.060
where dodging backwards was how I survived,

46:00.060 --> 46:02.540
this was the first major stumbling block of the game.

46:02.540 --> 46:04.380
It forced me to unlearn a style of play

46:04.380 --> 46:05.420
that was, in retrospect,

46:05.420 --> 46:06.780
conservative and uninteresting

46:06.780 --> 46:08.620
and honestly was worth forgetting.

46:08.620 --> 46:09.660
By the time of the attempts

46:09.660 --> 46:10.780
where I was close to winning,

46:10.780 --> 46:11.740
I was having more fun

46:11.740 --> 46:13.900
than any other encounter in previous games

46:13.900 --> 46:15.820
because the way I played was more engaging

46:15.820 --> 46:17.420
and felt faster and more fluid.

46:17.420 --> 46:19.900
I was choosing not to try to escape a skirmish

46:19.900 --> 46:21.980
because the enemy wouldn't let me do it so easily.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.340
Instead, I was staying close

46:23.340 --> 46:24.620
and getting in my own hits

46:24.620 --> 46:26.220
and ignoring when I was taking damage

46:26.220 --> 46:27.420
because I knew I would get it back

46:27.420 --> 46:29.820
just by continuing the fight and hitting them.

46:29.820 --> 46:32.380
Defeating Gascoigne is a genuine victory,

46:32.380 --> 46:33.500
and once you've done so,

46:33.500 --> 46:35.900
you've proven that you're capable of approaching battle

46:35.900 --> 46:38.540
in a way that's actually fun and quick and fast.

46:38.540 --> 46:40.540
You can't hang back and shoot spells at him

46:40.540 --> 46:42.300
and just not learn anything the whole game

46:42.300 --> 46:43.820
and be generally bored.

46:43.820 --> 46:46.940
You have to, well, learn to play the game

46:46.940 --> 46:49.180
the way many people have always played these games,

46:49.180 --> 46:50.860
but which doesn't come naturally.

46:50.860 --> 46:52.380
I could stop right here.

46:52.380 --> 46:54.220
You can already see the point, can't you?

46:54.220 --> 46:55.500
When you pick up Bloodborne,

46:55.500 --> 46:56.540
the first couple of hours

46:56.540 --> 46:57.820
of using these altered mechanics

46:57.820 --> 46:59.260
and mastering them train you

46:59.260 --> 47:00.860
to play not just Bloodborne,

47:00.860 --> 47:02.380
but any game in the series

47:02.380 --> 47:04.060
in a manner that's actually fun.

47:04.620 --> 47:06.060
After years of hitchhiking,

47:06.620 --> 47:09.180
normal people have finally been handed the keys

47:09.180 --> 47:10.620
to the Souls games,

47:10.620 --> 47:12.140
and that's a really good thing

47:12.140 --> 47:13.820
because these games are good.

47:13.820 --> 47:16.940
They just previously never quite showed people

47:16.940 --> 47:17.820
why they were good

47:17.820 --> 47:20.140
or how to play them in a way that felt good.

47:20.140 --> 47:22.300
I feel that this is why my friend liked it more

47:22.300 --> 47:24.220
and then went back and liked the rest,

47:24.220 --> 47:25.900
why people who couldn't get into any of them

47:25.900 --> 47:27.100
could get into this one

47:27.100 --> 47:28.140
at least a little more

47:28.140 --> 47:30.060
even if it still wasn't really their thing.

47:30.060 --> 47:31.580
In his review of Bloodborne,

47:31.580 --> 47:32.860
Yahtzee says this.

47:32.860 --> 47:35.020
"...from software who have been doing one specific thing

47:35.020 --> 47:36.220
for about four games now.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.580
Fortunately, it's a thing I'm into

47:37.580 --> 47:38.540
because I like explorative

47:38.540 --> 47:39.820
metroidvania-style gameplay,

47:39.820 --> 47:41.020
I like subtle storytelling,

47:41.020 --> 47:42.460
I like banging my head against a wall

47:42.460 --> 47:43.820
with a scary monster drawn on it."

47:43.820 --> 47:45.340
Trying to break down a fucking cement wall

47:45.340 --> 47:46.620
with your forehead isn't a challenge,

47:46.620 --> 47:48.460
it's grounds for getting fucking sectioned.

47:48.460 --> 47:49.980
"...from Demon's Souls to Dark Souls

47:49.980 --> 47:51.580
to Dark Souls 2 to Bloodborne.

47:51.580 --> 47:52.940
Same shit, different anus."

47:52.940 --> 47:54.220
Dark Souls 2 is the third game

47:54.220 --> 47:56.060
in a series that began with Demon's Souls,

47:56.060 --> 47:57.180
which I was thinking I should go back

47:57.180 --> 47:58.140
and try again sometime.

47:58.140 --> 47:59.900
Ooh, maybe you should have given Demon's Souls

47:59.900 --> 48:00.540
a proper shot.

48:00.540 --> 48:02.780
What a fantastic idea, you piece of shit.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.780
I'm not actually criticising Yahtzee here,

48:04.780 --> 48:05.980
although I guess I kind of am

48:05.980 --> 48:07.340
because he didn't give Demon's Souls

48:07.340 --> 48:08.380
a fair shot in the first place.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.900
I'm using his transition to show how

48:09.900 --> 48:11.260
this is just how perception of a game

48:11.260 --> 48:12.140
can change over time

48:12.140 --> 48:13.500
when it gets iterated upon.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.980
This transition and why it happened is valuable.

48:15.980 --> 48:17.660
Yahtzee's gone from hating Demon's Souls

48:17.660 --> 48:19.260
and thinking it's trial-and-error bullshit

48:19.260 --> 48:20.060
that isn't fun,

48:20.060 --> 48:22.700
to claiming it's part of a series he really likes

48:22.700 --> 48:25.020
and which, in his opinion, are all very similar.

48:25.020 --> 48:27.100
Good play conditioning can cause a player

48:27.100 --> 48:29.340
to suddenly want to commit

48:29.340 --> 48:31.820
to an experience superficially very similar

48:31.820 --> 48:33.980
to the one they previously really didn't.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.900
This is why Bloodborne is amazing.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.980
It's trained people to engage the game

48:37.980 --> 48:40.860
in a way that makes the experience worth having.

48:40.860 --> 48:42.700
Some games can be a good experience,

48:42.700 --> 48:45.180
but not very good at bringing people into it.

48:45.180 --> 48:46.300
Isn't it somewhat possible

48:46.300 --> 48:47.820
that there are many great games

48:47.820 --> 48:49.180
that slip through the cracks

48:49.180 --> 48:51.260
simply because they didn't fully prep the player

48:51.260 --> 48:53.020
to properly play and enjoy them?

48:53.020 --> 48:55.020
Maybe there's a right way to play every game.

48:55.020 --> 48:55.740
At the very least,

48:55.740 --> 48:57.420
there's a right way to play a Souls game,

48:57.420 --> 48:59.740
and Bloodborne finally teaches players

48:59.740 --> 49:02.380
what that way is in a straightforward manner.

49:02.380 --> 49:03.580
Okay, gonna be honest,

49:03.580 --> 49:04.860
that's my core argument.

49:04.860 --> 49:07.020
I think I just summarised it in about 40 minutes,

49:07.020 --> 49:08.220
which, all things considered,

49:08.220 --> 49:09.980
is pretty short for me.

49:09.980 --> 49:11.740
But while I'm here talking about Bloodborne,

49:11.740 --> 49:13.020
I might as well summarise

49:13.020 --> 49:15.580
the less condition-y reasons why it's so great

49:15.580 --> 49:17.580
and get more into the general reasons.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.500
Let's talk about the rest of the stuff.

49:24.140 --> 49:25.900
The Souls games in general, except for two,

49:25.900 --> 49:27.420
have this tendency to not really

49:27.420 --> 49:29.660
have an interesting story to me personally.

49:29.660 --> 49:30.380
They're like,

49:30.380 --> 49:31.740
oh, you have to stop the king.

49:31.740 --> 49:34.140
He went bad and or mad.

49:34.140 --> 49:36.220
All the characters you meet are mostly hangers-on

49:36.220 --> 49:38.620
who are also messing about in this doomed world.

49:38.620 --> 49:39.900
They tend to be interesting,

49:39.900 --> 49:41.820
but I could honestly take them or leave them.

49:41.820 --> 49:43.420
The story's extra wrinkles feel like

49:43.420 --> 49:45.820
they don't really add any value to the experience itself

49:45.820 --> 49:47.580
and are more just interesting stuff

49:47.580 --> 49:49.100
you can write wikis about later.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.100
There's an overall sense that all the fun stuff

49:51.100 --> 49:53.180
in the story has already happened,

49:53.180 --> 49:54.940
and while it was probably interesting

49:54.940 --> 49:56.380
and it's cool to find out about,

49:56.380 --> 49:58.860
the player is essentially given a walking tour of a world

49:58.860 --> 50:01.100
where all the cool stuff has already happened.

50:01.100 --> 50:03.580
All the major players in the story are either dead

50:03.580 --> 50:06.140
or hanging out waiting to be killed by you.

50:06.140 --> 50:07.340
Bloodborne is interesting

50:07.340 --> 50:09.500
because you're not on any singular quest.

50:09.500 --> 50:12.380
No one tells you to kill a bunch of people to do this stuff.

50:12.380 --> 50:13.580
The game even makes a joke

50:13.580 --> 50:15.420
about how unnecessary the story is,

50:15.420 --> 50:18.300
but the dude's unwillingness to share the truth with you

50:18.300 --> 50:19.500
is actually a clever setup

50:19.500 --> 50:22.700
for how this guy is maybe himself not super trustworthy.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.500
The story is happening at you instead of in the past.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.020
You're actively trying to uncover

50:27.020 --> 50:28.620
what's happening as you play,

50:28.620 --> 50:30.620
not because it might be interesting

50:30.620 --> 50:32.300
to find out about in general,

50:32.300 --> 50:33.980
but to have a grip on what's happening

50:33.980 --> 50:36.940
and what result my actions are having on the world.

50:36.940 --> 50:38.940
There's a real sense of time passing

50:38.940 --> 50:40.140
over the course of the game

50:40.140 --> 50:41.340
as the night progresses

50:41.340 --> 50:42.940
and the people locked in their houses

50:42.940 --> 50:44.540
get more worried or sicker

50:44.540 --> 50:47.180
or begin to transform into monsters themselves.

50:47.180 --> 50:50.540
There's this game called Ocarina of Zelda Legend of Ti-

50:50.540 --> 50:51.340
Wait.

50:51.340 --> 50:54.140
There's this game called Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

50:54.140 --> 50:57.180
and in it, there's this place called Hyrule Castle Town.

50:57.180 --> 50:59.260
It's a small and simple area,

50:59.260 --> 51:00.620
especially by modern standards,

51:00.620 --> 51:03.260
but there's so much character and life to it.

51:03.260 --> 51:05.020
Even for an N64 game,

51:05.100 --> 51:07.500
there are cool stores and side quests

51:07.500 --> 51:09.820
and just people hanging out having a good time

51:09.820 --> 51:10.780
and that music.

51:11.820 --> 51:13.820
It feels like a place full of life.

51:13.820 --> 51:15.500
One thing games like Dark Souls lack

51:15.500 --> 51:17.820
is this idea that there's even a world

51:17.820 --> 51:19.820
worth fighting for somewhere.

51:19.820 --> 51:23.180
The entire world of the games are empty nightmares

51:23.180 --> 51:25.180
populated only by the dying,

51:25.180 --> 51:26.060
the dead,

51:26.060 --> 51:27.180
the undead,

51:27.180 --> 51:28.140
the mad,

51:28.140 --> 51:28.860
the sad,

51:28.860 --> 51:29.900
the monstrous,

51:29.900 --> 51:31.980
and Scottish people.

51:31.980 --> 51:34.860
Link is being told he's supposed to help Zelda save the world

51:34.860 --> 51:36.540
and he is a world worth saving.

51:36.540 --> 51:38.380
Hyrule Castle Town stuck with me,

51:38.380 --> 51:40.620
mainly because when you pull out the Master Sword

51:40.620 --> 51:43.100
and time advances and you go outside...

51:58.940 --> 52:00.620
It's become this horrible place.

52:01.500 --> 52:04.060
Only three things in this era of gaming

52:04.060 --> 52:07.100
ever gave me genuine chills of fear.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.340
The terrifying werewolf monster thing

52:09.340 --> 52:12.380
that attacks you out of nowhere in Castlevania 64,

52:12.380 --> 52:14.940
the landmine with eyes in Banjo-Kazooie,

52:14.940 --> 52:17.180
which legitimately scared me a lot as a kid,

52:17.900 --> 52:19.500
and coming out of the Temple of Time

52:19.500 --> 52:21.580
to discover that the lovely, happy town

52:21.580 --> 52:23.900
had been reduced to this.

52:23.900 --> 52:25.740
It shocked my tiny mind,

52:25.740 --> 52:27.500
seeing it just change like that.

52:27.500 --> 52:30.700
That ability to imbue a sense in a player about a place

52:30.700 --> 52:33.820
is really important, I think.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.340
Now, Bloodborne doesn't have a section

52:35.340 --> 52:36.780
where you see what the town was like

52:36.780 --> 52:38.140
when things were nice,

52:38.140 --> 52:40.940
but by starting just a little bit off-kilter,

52:40.940 --> 52:43.260
just a little bit covered in monsters,

52:43.260 --> 52:45.660
you see that there is something worth saving in there,

52:45.660 --> 52:47.580
and as those things start to disappear

52:47.580 --> 52:49.580
and things take a Lovecraftian turn,

52:50.220 --> 52:52.140
there's that same sense of loss

52:52.140 --> 52:53.900
that things have gotten so much worse.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.180
And I love Lovecraft.

52:55.180 --> 52:57.340
He was my favorite author when I was 14

52:57.340 --> 52:59.980
until I noticed that no one was actually impressed

52:59.980 --> 53:02.540
when I would say sanguine instead of red.

53:02.540 --> 53:04.940
In retrospect, he's not as great a writer as I remember,

53:04.940 --> 53:06.380
and he's kind of one-note,

53:06.380 --> 53:07.980
but his writing has inspired a wealth

53:07.980 --> 53:10.380
of fantastic designs and stories over the years

53:10.380 --> 53:12.540
that take liberties the way he didn't

53:12.540 --> 53:15.180
and maintain the same sense of terror at the unknown

53:15.180 --> 53:19.420
while having other less-secretly-super-racist stuff in there, too.

53:19.420 --> 53:21.980
And Bloodborne is one of those fantastic stories.

53:21.980 --> 53:24.140
It has a sense of cosmic terror

53:24.140 --> 53:25.900
that only appears in the third act,

53:25.900 --> 53:28.060
but when it comes, it comes in a big way,

53:28.060 --> 53:30.620
making it super surprising and harder-hitting

53:30.620 --> 53:32.540
than it would have been if it had started out that way

53:32.540 --> 53:34.460
or been super predictable about it.

53:34.460 --> 53:35.980
Oh, it's horrible.

53:35.980 --> 53:37.420
Birth imagery. I hate it.

53:38.140 --> 53:40.220
The world design is great as well.

53:40.220 --> 53:41.900
Okay, Dark Souls.

53:41.900 --> 53:43.100
Interconnected world.

53:43.100 --> 53:45.500
Lots of alternate paths and secret ways into other areas.

53:46.220 --> 53:47.180
It's great.

53:47.180 --> 53:48.940
But you know what sucks?

53:48.940 --> 53:50.780
Backtracking all the way across it again

53:50.780 --> 53:53.340
because you died and there's no bonfire anywhere near it.

53:53.340 --> 53:55.340
Too much time is spent walking back and forth

53:55.340 --> 53:57.020
through areas you've already visited,

53:57.020 --> 53:59.020
and the world never really changes,

53:59.100 --> 54:01.260
so you're seeing the same area over and over,

54:01.260 --> 54:03.500
except sometimes you're seeing it backwards.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.860
I know the entirety of Dark Souls' world like the back of my hand.

54:06.860 --> 54:09.260
That's not because it's super memorable or interesting,

54:09.260 --> 54:11.820
but because I had to walk through all of it a lot

54:11.820 --> 54:14.860
to get to newer places or because I died again.

54:14.860 --> 54:17.500
Demon's Souls, in my opinion, was actually better.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.500
There's basically no backtracking.

54:19.500 --> 54:20.940
There's no interconnectedness either.

54:20.940 --> 54:22.860
Each archstone takes you to a different area,

54:22.860 --> 54:25.500
and you go in a linear path to the end and then leave.

54:25.500 --> 54:29.020
It doesn't have pretensions of being interconnected or one big world

54:29.020 --> 54:31.420
and instead focuses on making levels that are interesting

54:31.420 --> 54:33.900
and engaging to play through the very first time.

54:33.900 --> 54:36.220
Demon's Souls is a little bit harder than Dark Souls

54:36.220 --> 54:38.700
because the creators of Dark Souls at some point realized

54:38.700 --> 54:40.460
that people would be fighting through each level

54:40.460 --> 54:42.300
several times forwards and backwards

54:42.300 --> 54:44.620
and eventually people would just want to run past most of it

54:44.620 --> 54:46.380
to get where they were trying to go.

54:46.380 --> 54:50.140
So they designed areas where running away tended to work out pretty good.

54:50.140 --> 54:54.300
Demon's Souls is almost hard-coded to destroy you if you try that shit.

54:54.300 --> 54:58.220
But the trade-off is the encounter itself is more challenging and rewarding

54:58.220 --> 55:01.580
because it's designed to be approached once from one particular direction.

55:01.580 --> 55:04.380
I will take good level design over an open feeling world

55:04.380 --> 55:08.300
I'll have to backtrack through constantly every single time.

55:08.300 --> 55:11.900
The best areas in Dark Souls, Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo,

55:11.900 --> 55:13.900
don't really interconnect with anywhere

55:13.900 --> 55:18.380
and instead they're mostly a straight shot from where you start to meeting the boss.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.620
It's the best area precisely because,

55:20.620 --> 55:23.260
since the developers only intend for you to fight all the way through it

55:23.260 --> 55:24.940
once in one direction,

55:24.940 --> 55:29.180
it feeds you encounters precisely primed to challenge you in a specific way

55:29.180 --> 55:30.460
instead of having to be designed

55:30.460 --> 55:33.180
so you could come through in any direction to go somewhere else

55:33.180 --> 55:35.580
which loosens what you can really do.

55:35.580 --> 55:39.820
Anor Londo feels a bit like a remake of some sections of the Boletarian Palace

55:39.820 --> 55:42.460
and I wish more sections were willing to be more linear

55:42.460 --> 55:44.860
and just be more interesting that first time.

55:44.860 --> 55:46.780
Fighting your way back out of Blighttown

55:46.780 --> 55:49.500
or running all the way back through the door Havel's guarding

55:49.500 --> 55:51.660
just to get to the Darkroot Basin is annoying

55:51.660 --> 55:53.340
and just generally uninteresting.

55:53.340 --> 55:55.580
Especially when it's for the eighth time.

55:55.580 --> 55:58.620
I'm still in a dream...

55:59.820 --> 56:01.420
Dark Soul...

56:01.420 --> 56:03.500
Darkroot Basin in general feels kind of dumb.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.140
It's just a big area mostly empty of stuff to deal with

56:06.140 --> 56:08.620
with some kind of simplistic enemies dropped there.

56:08.620 --> 56:11.660
If I wanted to have a bad time running through a mostly empty world

56:11.660 --> 56:13.420
I would just play Monster Hunter.

56:17.420 --> 56:20.140
The Darkroot Basin also has the most dumb boss in the game

56:20.140 --> 56:22.300
who has two attacks they do over and over

56:22.300 --> 56:24.780
and which basically miss even if you're standing still.

56:25.340 --> 56:28.940
Bloodborne combines both of the best elements of each game.

56:28.940 --> 56:32.380
It's never got any areas that are too open and have nothing in them.

56:32.380 --> 56:34.940
Even areas taking place in the forest are dense

56:34.940 --> 56:37.180
with well-made and challenging encounters

56:37.180 --> 56:39.500
and let's not forget actual traps

56:39.500 --> 56:41.580
that seem like they were laid out for a person.

56:42.780 --> 56:44.060
Jesus! No! No!

56:44.060 --> 56:50.540
Oh, I saw it just as I stepped on it.

56:52.780 --> 56:55.100
Backtracking is reduced because there are more lanterns

56:55.100 --> 56:56.780
and while areas are interconnected

56:56.780 --> 56:59.580
many sections are essentially straight shots to the next area

56:59.580 --> 57:01.660
with short side paths containing items.

57:01.660 --> 57:04.460
So you have a big open world that feels interconnected

57:04.460 --> 57:06.780
but surprising amounts of linearity.

57:06.780 --> 57:09.020
So you can have areas like this that only work

57:09.020 --> 57:10.780
if you're approaching from one direction

57:10.780 --> 57:13.260
so all these enemies are actually waiting and hiding for you

57:13.260 --> 57:14.300
and shoot at you.

57:14.300 --> 57:16.220
Coming back through this area would be weird

57:16.220 --> 57:18.060
but you never have to think about that

57:18.060 --> 57:19.420
because you never have to.

57:19.420 --> 57:21.340
You can teleport around easily.

57:21.340 --> 57:23.660
There's quite a delicate sense of linearity

57:23.660 --> 57:25.900
and traveling across areas you've already visited

57:25.900 --> 57:29.180
because you have a key or some new thing has been unlocked by your actions

57:29.180 --> 57:31.980
and thanks to a mechanic I'm going to call the knight

57:31.980 --> 57:34.460
where an actual story progresses as you kill bosses

57:34.460 --> 57:37.180
and the effects of your growing pool of insight too.

57:37.180 --> 57:39.980
Even pre-visited areas are a little bit different

57:39.980 --> 57:41.900
either visually or otherwise.

57:41.900 --> 57:44.620
Enemies change around, get glowy scary scythes

57:44.620 --> 57:47.900
and red versions of sticks

57:47.900 --> 57:49.500
or just go to sleep.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.660
So the experience of going back through Cathedral Ward

57:51.660 --> 57:53.260
to go to a new area is valuable

57:53.260 --> 57:56.540
because it's changing and you're seeing things being different.

57:56.540 --> 57:59.180
You're not just revisiting it or going through it again

57:59.180 --> 58:01.500
but backwards to get to the next new area.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.900
Okay, also co-op isn't garbage anymore.

58:03.900 --> 58:06.780
Trying to summon friends in these games has always been super annoying.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.460
You have to hope you're on the same server

58:08.460 --> 58:10.700
or the servers are even up anymore.

58:10.700 --> 58:12.940
You have to go human or consumer humanity

58:12.940 --> 58:14.860
and sit at the bonfire and go human

58:14.860 --> 58:16.860
and hope you see their summon sign

58:16.860 --> 58:20.300
and then maybe you'll summon someone to help with Ornstein and...

58:21.420 --> 58:22.300
Smeg.

58:22.300 --> 58:24.620
But as you can tell from this footage it didn't work

58:24.620 --> 58:26.300
and I died on the way to summon Solaire

58:26.300 --> 58:28.220
and I didn't have any humanity left to try it again

58:28.220 --> 58:29.580
so I had to do it myself

58:29.580 --> 58:31.900
and by do it myself I mean get fucked.

58:31.900 --> 58:35.260
Also being human makes it so you can be invaded by other players.

58:35.260 --> 58:36.540
You know what sucks?

58:36.540 --> 58:38.140
That becoming human,

58:38.140 --> 58:42.300
the thing you do if you need help with something you're having trouble with

58:42.300 --> 58:46.060
is also the thing that invites in more people to gank you to death.

58:46.060 --> 58:47.740
Like, no thanks.

58:47.740 --> 58:50.860
I can see the idea of it being cool and risk-reward

58:50.860 --> 58:52.300
but it's actually shit

58:52.300 --> 58:53.740
because it means you can be invaded

58:53.740 --> 58:56.620
before you even get to find someone you can summon

58:56.620 --> 58:59.580
and if I'm summoning at all I'm already having trouble.

58:59.580 --> 59:03.020
Bloodborne's co-op feels like it was actually made by people

59:03.020 --> 59:06.060
who assumed other people might want to use it.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.780
There's no human or inhuman state anymore.

59:08.780 --> 59:12.540
Instead, if you need a hand, you ring the please help me bell.

59:12.540 --> 59:15.180
Uh, in Britain we're actually all given one of those at birth.

59:15.180 --> 59:18.700
And if someone else is ringing the help people bell

59:18.700 --> 59:20.540
they're pulled in to give you a hand.

59:20.540 --> 59:23.900
It's simple and you don't have to mess about looking for signs anymore.

59:23.900 --> 59:26.300
Only after summoning can you get invaded

59:26.300 --> 59:30.620
so you have someone helping you with the area you're obviously finding difficult

59:30.620 --> 59:32.620
and the new person coming to get you

59:32.620 --> 59:34.700
at least definitely has to deal with two of you

59:34.700 --> 59:36.380
which seems a bit more fair.

59:36.380 --> 59:38.300
And if you want to co-op with a specific person

59:38.300 --> 59:41.020
you can both enter a password of your choosing and go.

59:41.020 --> 59:43.980
Also, insight seems to be a less rare resource

59:43.980 --> 59:45.500
than all the others in previous games

59:45.500 --> 59:49.500
so it's less likely you're gonna run out of your ability to ask for help

59:49.500 --> 59:50.940
which is a really good idea.

59:50.940 --> 59:54.780
Oh, and since insight is tied to certain enemies getting harder

59:54.780 --> 59:57.100
if you need a lot of help you're lowering it

59:57.100 --> 59:59.260
so things will eventually let up.

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.100
Not much, but it's nice.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.380
It's really nice.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.580
Also, the sound design.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.660
It's just brilliant.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.220
Everything.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.340
The monster howls.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.780
The trick weapons clicky-clacking into their alternate forms.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.660
The thunderous pounding of the machine gun.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.180
The squelching of the monsters getting slit up by me.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.460
The extra diegetic

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.740
that plays when you parry someone successfully.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.060
The squeal of the tonitrus as it comes alive and thirsts for crime.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.260
It's all great.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.140
I hope the sound designers get to write a book about the work they did

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.380
making this game feel so great.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.380
And in 10 years, once I know enough Japanese

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.620
to be able to comprehend basic sentences

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.140
I'll even be able to read it.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.940
The key thing that proves the power of the sound in this game

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.820
is that these crow enemies are like regular-looking crows

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.100
if a bit oversized.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.820
They attack by fluttering at you with their wings.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.580
But they do this when they attack you.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.660
These crows are a nightmare.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.340
They hide in just the right places

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.820
and they make just a loud and horrifying enough noise

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:01.180
that it never feels like they're an easy enemy to deal with.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.340
They're always just scary.

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:06.620
They even come close to the fucking landmine.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.620
Fucking Jesus Christ.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.820
It's just great stuff.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.420
There's a section in Yahoo! Ghoul where I just had to stop and listen.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.260
There's ominous, distant, pseudo-diegetic chanting,

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.700
vague screams and cries in the distance.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.980
It's really quite something.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.900
I don't like describing games as atmospheric

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.060
or dripping with atmosphere or anything like that.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.420
That feels kind of like a cop-out.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.460
But even attempting to describe the feeling of standing still in an area

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.100
has caused me to slip into this really subdued tone.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:45.020
To me at least, that says something about the game's ability to communicate.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.540
It says something about the game's command and attitude.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.700
Also, because I'm standing in an area where I just cleaned out a bunch of enemies,

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.020
ghosts keep appearing and shooting in my direction

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.500
because they're still fighting them, and I think that's kind of funny.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.860
Okay, finally, the big monster boss fights.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.660
Souls games are bad at these, in my opinion.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.460
I get it, a lot of people like the Gaping Dragon and think he's cool

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.460
and there's a, you know, they're interesting-looking.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:13.020
But in my opinion, they're not that great to fight, which is the important bit.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.860
I often refer to as the dudes-in-armor argument

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.100
that Souls games feature too many enemies that are just dudes in armor.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.940
But in fights, monsters and the big, cool, weird enemies

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.540
don't react in a manner that makes sense to me as a player.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.020
Human enemies respond when you hit them with your sword,

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:33.020
but Sif, for example, doesn't seem to even flinch most of the time.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.420
Even the final boss flinches when you hit him, so you at least know it's working.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.660
I am making some of the mightiest swings you can possibly imagine right now

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.620
using my character, who incidentally I named Brexit,

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.700
and she's like, eh, whatever.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.860
I'm gonna continue moving like it's a normal thing.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.380
No selling all my best moves, just like all the other women in my life.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.380
Even Sif is negging me.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.740
And suddenly she's limping.

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.340
I mean, oh, it's so sad.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.420
Oh, it's a sad dog, etc.

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.900
But where was this kind of reacting before?

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.260
And you can't parry monstery enemies of any kind either.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.060
It took me major trial and error for me to even determine

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.100
if you could parry the Snake Men in Sen's Fortress.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.380
By the way, the answer is yes, but only some attacks.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:19.740
The Dark Souls wiki even has an extensive list of what creatures you actually can parry

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.500
and what attacks you can parry.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.460
I get that not everything you're fighting is technically humanoid

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.300
or has a weapon that you can parry in a traditional sense,

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.100
but it still feels really lacking in my opinion

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.980
that you can't use one of the most interesting mechanics in the game

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.820
against, like, half the enemies.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.300
You can kind of parry monsters' attacks.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.140
It causes them to do a bit less damage,

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.820
but seriously, what the fuck?

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.500
If you have a pseudo parry mechanic,

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.100
just let me fucking parry this guy.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:45.980
Jesus.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.460
The timing is often incredibly hard.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.500
Like, literally harder than putting your shield up or dodging,

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.780
and all it does is cause you to take reduced damage?

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.620
Like, what?

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.260
Bloodborne finally sorts that shit out.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.300
It makes monstrous enemies react better to being attacked,

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.780
even bosses, where you can suddenly do cool things

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.860
like break individual limbs.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.500
When you finally topple Dark Beast Pal to the ground

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.820
because you knocked him so completely off balance,

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.140
there's a real sense that you've gained an upper hand

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.020
and rattled his...bones.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.540
On top of that, you can now parry most of these enemies.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.860
Even bosses can often be parried.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.340
That's what let me finally beat the blood-starved beast

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.660
after an embarrassing amount of attempts.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.540
I personally never got bored with dudes in armor.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.780
Like, that was just the most fun type of fight

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:34.300
in the Souls series thus far.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.020
It wasn't broken, but Bloodborne fixed it

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.340
by coming up with many different kinds of monster,

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.660
but making the fights feel super responsive

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.020
to your actions within them.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.540
I haven't played Dark Souls 3 yet

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.460
because I wanted to make this video first,

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.500
but I hope that if it does have more monstery-type enemies,

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.580
it has this kind of responsiveness also.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.020
I would honestly prefer to have even more dudes in armor

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.140
than bad dogs or bad rats.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.820
Oh, no, not that! No!

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.700
Okay, also, the blood vials is just a great healing system.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.700
Or just all the way through.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.700
Like, I talked before about how the Estus Flask

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.740
is really, really good

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.060
because it's an infinite source of health,

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.700
but the trade-off there is there aren't any items

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.620
you can then also use for healing.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.500
You just have that finite resource.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.340
What I quite like about Bloodborne's system

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.660
is you have a lot of healing items,

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.780
but they're finite.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.260
You have enough that it's not ever a huge problem,

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.460
but you can theoretically run out.

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.140
So it becomes more like,

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.220
but you always have enough vials to get your health back

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.740
almost all the way after an encounter

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.860
so you can keep going.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.900
But on top of that,

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.940
you are really likely to pick blood vials up

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.780
as you go in fights with people.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.380
For example, in this section, I lose a ton of health,

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.020
but I get all the vials back as a result of the fight,

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:46.460
so it feels balanced.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.740
And since they don't always drop,

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.060
I am eventually supposed to get better.

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.100
I don't, but still.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.820
One issue in Demon's Souls that kind of made it broken

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.420
was you could, at a certain point,

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.420
buy a hundred of the best healing item

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.620
and just carry them around

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.380
and basically be invincible.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.420
Which, I mean, is maybe a problem

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.780
if a game is supposed to be challenging.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.340
Bloodborne kind of fixes it

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.940
by giving you a really good healing item

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.140
and giving you quite a lot,

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.580
but having an upper limit on how many

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.100
you could ever possibly have.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.140
So I feel like Bloodborne might have perfected the system

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.220
by giving you a lot of a finite amount of thing.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.500
However, it is possible to run out

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.860
and have to farm for them,

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.540
which isn't so great.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.740
In my opinion, they could have had it

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.780
so you always start with 20 or even 10 blood vials

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.260
and continue to pick them up the way you do now.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.860
But that would completely take away the idea

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.380
of being able to stock up on them

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.980
and use them like a regular item

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.020
and sell them and stuff,

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.020
so maybe there's a reason why they didn't do that.

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.500
I mean, maybe the game designers did stuff on purpose.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.220
I don't know.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.380
Blood vials also heal a set percentage

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.900
of your maximum health,

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.900
so they're always a useful source of healing,

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.980
unlike, for example, the Crescent Moongrass,

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.060
which is just piss.

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.500
Also, you heal a lot faster.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.220
In previous games, they wanted healing

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.740
to be like this risk-reward thing

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.940
where you stop,

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.300
so if you want to heal,

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.020
you're taking a huge risk in leaving yourself open.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.500
But it seems like they settled in Bloodborne

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.620
of having it be a really quick thing

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.060
you can do almost any time

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.820
and just forgiving you for that.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:14.780
And that's okay.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.860
Maybe it theoretically makes it less challenging

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.660
in some ways,

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.940
but it's worth it

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.100
because it means you don't die while healing,

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.020
and that just feels bad,

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.220
even if it's your fault.

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.420
But since they took that out,

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.500
now you only ever die because you failed to dodge

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.700
or because you were attacking

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.580
when you shouldn't have done,

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.580
and that, I think, feels a lot better.

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:36.060
🎶

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.700
There are still some criticisms I have of Bloodborne, though,

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.580
where it falls short or seems to take a step back.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.780
Here's a kind of big thing.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.820
I'm a little disappointed by the NPC encounters.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.540
The NPCs in Souls games have about as much health as you,

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.620
or at least an amount that seems fair.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.700
However, they can do things like heal.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.740
It's fun and cool,

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.860
and there's back and forth,

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.460
and it's just always neat.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.020
I like the garden leading up to the Sith boss fight quite a lot

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.180
just because of all the cool, unique NPCs

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.460
that come to wreck your shit,

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.860
including Man With Inferior Jump Attack.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.140
Aw, there, there.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.580
🔔

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.980
An idiot who forgot that arrows move in slow motion

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.260
in Dark Souls Land.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.220
And oh, wow, Patrick Klepek's Demon's Souls character

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.180
is here, too.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.100
And if you really like fighting characters

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.780
with similar abilities to you,

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.100
there's a cat who wants to help you protect the garden

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.260
from other real human players.

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.020
If you join their covenant and wear their ring,

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.100
occasionally you get summoned in as a blue phantom,

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.460
so you, yes, you can get backstabbed from ten feet away

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.500
and wonder if PvP will ever fucking work in these games.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.820
In Bloodborne, stray hunters and hunter-sized bosses

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.260
have obscene amounts of health.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.940
This puts you at a massive disadvantage

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.260
and does away with the feeling that you're fighting an equal

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.260
and instead fighting a boss version

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.500
that doesn't really play by the same rules as you.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.540
Stop shooting me!

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.820
Oh, my God!

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.500
None of them can heal like you can,

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.020
which kind of balances it out,

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.460
but it doesn't feel right.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.660
Actually, no, some of them do heal

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.780
and they get back a ton of health,

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.060
and it's kind of messed up.

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.300
I know it's possible to get in and make sure they don't,

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.220
and it's more challenging for them to have more health,

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.300
but it's not challenging in a way that's fun.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.420
It feels off.

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.340
In my opinion, these fights would be better served

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.260
if they had an equivalent amount of health as you

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.340
but could get their health back from rallying like you

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.180
and would heal themselves in a pinch.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.780
They'd be more interesting back and forth

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:15.740
like in the previous games,

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.300
and it wouldn't feel so much like a long, dull slog

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.820
every time you refight them,

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.140
getting them slowly back down to that last sliver

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:24.540
before they suddenly shoot you dead instantly again.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.860
Great, now I have to come back and pick away at his health

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.860
and hope he doesn't insta-kill me again.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.940
Bloodborne? More like blood...

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.060
snorn.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.660
Gah.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.620
You can fucking hit me out of my combo

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.060
while I'm hitting you.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.460
That is a fucked up thing to put in a game.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.700
That's fucked up, right?

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.620
Also, they have seemingly infinite ammo,

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.460
which is just rude.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.700
Weirdly enough, invasions by other players

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.580
show off my version of this mechanic perfectly.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.460
I got invaded exactly once in my first playthrough,

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.900
and it was exhilarating.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.900
We both came close to dying multiple times

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.300
and made spaces to heal as we continued to fight.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.580
Healing is super quick,

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.940
but the developers were smart enough

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.300
to make this parryable.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.820
That's how I won in the end.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.580
I kind of wish I'd been invaded more,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.340
and that's not really something I say often

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.620
about the Souls series.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.780
Maybe I'm just being a big whiny baby here,

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.700
or maybe that one invasion was so fun

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.460
it's forced me to wish there were more fights

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.660
like that in the game itself,

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.340
but I think an improvement I'd like to see

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.940
in a theoretical Bloodborne 2

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.460
would be more enemies that resemble

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.660
that kind of encounter.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.260
I want the sense that the other hunters

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.500
got where they did by being exceptionally skilled

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.180
with the same assets as me,

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.860
not because they inexplicably had

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.660
many times more health and infinite ammo.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.160
Oh.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:37.740
But because of these dead...

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:38.240
Stop it!

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.260
But because of these dead...

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.540
I also think the blood vial system,

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.580
while good and fun,

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.060
has the inherent downsides of if you run out,

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.340
you can't easily buy more

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.820
because they're just a bit too expensive per vial,

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.180
and if you're in an area or boss

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.140
that kills you a lot,

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.060
you're not going to be recovering them from enemies,

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.220
so you inevitably have to go farm vials

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.340
or the souls to buy them,

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.100
and that's just not great when it happens.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.020
There's also some incredibly weird bits

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.300
where enemies aren't designed

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.820
for the areas you find them in,

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:04.780
like some of the bosses

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.860
or the giants in Cathedral Ward.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.060
I'd like you to tell me

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.500
what even hit me there,

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:11.980
and why do you have to go back

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.100
to the central hub

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.540
every time you want to go somewhere?

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.580
That's kind of annoying.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.260
These are all relatively small problems

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.220
in the grand scheme.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.740
My main problem with the game

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.180
is also the best demonstration

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.580
of why the rest of Bloodborne is so good.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.580
The chalice dungeons.

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.580
Oh my god!

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.420
They're a completely optional part of the game

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.620
where you can go into dungeons

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.500
and traverse them,

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.020
fighting more bosses and enemies,

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.700
and some of them are randomly generated,

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.980
meaning there is theoretically

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.500
infinite content in Bloodborne,

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.500
but I'm going to be honest,

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.100
they're really bad.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.060
By stripping out the part

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.500
where the levels are carefully designed

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.180
to be fun and good and interesting

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.580
and challenge you in a fair and reactive way,

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.140
the dungeon segments can be teeth-grindingly bad

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.500
in ways that simply aren't fun.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.180
Accidentally,

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.300
they're object lessons

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.380
in why we still have level designers

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.660
and don't just have a computer

01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.100
churn out all our levels.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.260
The chalice dungeons are so lazily put together

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:01.980
that this guy,

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:03.020
who spawns in, like,

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.140
all of the important rooms

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.420
in any given dungeon,

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.580
like, one of the bosses in the dungeons

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.780
is just three of him.

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.540
So on some floors,

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.140
you beat one of these guys,

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.220
hit the switch that unlocks the boss door,

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.900
and then you fight three more of him,

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:16.400
and you're like,

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:17.600
what?

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.340
You know, I've heard criticisms

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.780
that some enemies in the Souls series

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.980
start to get repetitive,

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.020
but honestly,

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.500
they don't even come close to this,

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500
where you're literally just fighting the same guy

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.580
over and over in different permutations.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:30.860
I'm not covering the chalice dungeons

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.900
in very much detail here

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.900
because I feel like I've talked about Bloodborne

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.780
enough at this point,

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.420
so it's not really going to hammer home

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.100
how just bad this is.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:39.600
Like,

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.580
this room you're seeing right now,

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:42.940
you will see this room copied

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.220
over and over

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:44.940
for hours.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.100
That is all the chalice dungeons are.

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:47.900
There are,

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:48.400
there are, like,

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.340
five, six different kinds of room

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.380
repeated

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:53.660
over and over.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.100
Honestly, watch this part of the video

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:55.900
on a loop for, like,

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.740
two and a half hours,

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.380
and you will have a full replication

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.060
of about as much of the chalice dungeon

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.060
as I can stand to record

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.100
to make this video.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.300
Even the pre-made dungeons

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.660
are just the same kind of rooms

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.740
in different configurations over and over.

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:10.860
It's not great.

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:11.980
You know what it reminded me of?

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.740
Kingsfield.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:16.460
And no game should be like Kingsfield.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.100
Oh, hey, look.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.140
It's another one of those.

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.220
I'm so fucking surprised.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.740
They also reveal how good

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.700
the rest of the game is

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.700
by showing how much care and attention

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.740
must have gone into making

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.100
all the areas and encounters

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.100
look and feel as good as they do.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.380
And they do that by showing

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.660
how lacking the game would have been

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.860
if they hadn't been there.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.140
Yharnam does the impossible

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.140
by feeling varied and huge and complex

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.420
while being primarily focused

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.300
on one big kind of similar-looking town

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.380
made of very similar kinds of architecture

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.100
throughout.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.700
The chalice dungeons remind me

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.060
of the parts of dungeon crawlers

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.740
that don't hold up to scrutiny either.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.740
They're almost literally just box rooms

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.420
with grimy stone textures

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.380
thrown up everywhere.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.220
If Bloodborne were released as a roguelike

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.620
that used this randomly generated stuff

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.380
or if the whole game looked and felt

01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.820
like the chalice dungeons,

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.180
I think I would hate it.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.780
There's this game called Necropolis.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.700
It's billed as a Dark Souls roguelike.

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.220
It's kind of boring.

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.660
The enemies are repetitive.

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.940
There's no boss fights.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.860
Even quick attacks feel slow

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.300
like in Lords of the Fallen.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.340
And more importantly,

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.700
the lack of design

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.460
in any of the levels or environments

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:17.740
means there's no character

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.100
or feel to the world.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.300
It's the chalice dungeons

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.900
but without the upshot of being attached

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.500
to an actually good game.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.620
I guess what I'm saying is

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.980
I like games when they're...

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.420
designed by people?

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.220
Weirdly enough,

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.420
while some of the new bosses

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.020
that only appear in the chalice dungeons

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.620
are repeated a lot across them

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.980
and clearly didn't have much time

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:36.940
or effort put into them

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.540
and don't strike me as particularly

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.980
interesting in and of themselves,

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.420
several of them are super fun

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.180
to actually fight once you get to them.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.140
It's almost a shame

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.500
that the content you have to pass through

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.020
to get to them are kind of boring

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.060
or actively unfun

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.820
because they're worthy encounters.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.340
I almost wonder if all the bosses

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.060
you encounter here

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:52.940
are the ones they made

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.140
and weren't happy with

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:54.940
so they didn't bother

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.300
putting them in the main game,

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.260
which naturally means

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.060
the best ones here

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.260
are the ones that feel the most

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.020
like they should have been after all.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.740
Look at that!

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.020
There's a boss from earlier

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.300
in the regular dungeons

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.500
just walking around

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.660
and he's surrounded by two other bosses

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.260
from earlier in this dungeon

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.180
and they—they kill him for me!

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:12.860
What?!

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:13.740
The chalice dungeons

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.100
make a lot of points for me

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.860
about the importance of level design

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.300
and execution in these games

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.980
and show how the base mechanics alone

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:20.860
wouldn't be enough

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.020
for an engaging and fun experience.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.220
You need the push and pull

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.900
of a designer hiding enemies

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:27.420
in just the right places,

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.260
scaling the difficulty of encounters

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.380
through careful development

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.740
of enemy placement and so on.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.420
Oh, I fucking see you, mate.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:35.980
Yeah, I've played—

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.260
I've played a video game before.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.020
You're not weird, are you?

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:39.740
Welcome—

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.740
Welcome to Dark Souls!

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.860
That's the first trick

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.980
they pull in all those games.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:44.780
Yep.

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:46.300
You got me the first time through.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.980
This is a true Souls game.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.340
Don't even bother

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.220
looking at what I picked up.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.540
The real victory was—

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.260
Oh, Jesus!

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.540
I was feeling so full of myself then

01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.980
and, like, another guy came.

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:01.420
Holy shit.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.260
This game's amazing.

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.820
If you like walking from box room

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.340
to box room full

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.180
just of a bunch of random enemies

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:09.900
plopped in there

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.300
and, oh, look, it's another one of those,

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.700
then I guess

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.140
the chalice dungeons are for you.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.060
If you like the chalice dungeons

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.020
and the randomness,

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.700
I can see an appeal to that,

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.300
but let's admit that

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.980
the actual game is more fun

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.060
and if that, for you,

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.020
is a contentious point,

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.900
then I'm sorry,

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.620
but you are beneath me.

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.980
Here's the part where I wrap up

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.260
and give some pithy comments

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.620
about how developers have things

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.460
to learn from Bloodborne,

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:43.980
but do they?

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.580
Not every game has to learn something

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:46.380
from Bloodborne.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.660
Not every game is attempting

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.340
such a sharp, crackling,

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.300
deliberateness,

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.580
such a test of perception

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.500
and prediction over raw mechanical input

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.100
or simpler sorts of puzzle

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.340
or such a specific sense of uncertainty

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.620
and esoteric horror.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.540
While many designers might well recognize

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.500
in Bloodborne a method

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.300
they could get across

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.140
their own intended reaction better,

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.180
a way of helping players

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.380
to get the best experience

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.020
from their work

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.220
by altering the attitude

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.500
with which they perceive it,

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.420
an equal, if not larger amount,

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.620
should strive to learn

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.820
absolutely nothing.

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:14.700
Gamers everywhere

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.540
have already had years of laughing

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.740
and attempts to commodify

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.580
their enjoyment of the Souls series.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.500
The endless descriptions of new games

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:21.900
with,

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.940
it's like Dark Souls,

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.980
but with Y.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:24.940
The sad truth is,

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.980
the most common reason

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.500
the Souls games didn't have Y

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.300
is because they would have been

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.260
the worst for it.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.940
You know, I thought I wanted a roguelike

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.380
that was a bit like Dark Souls,

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.740
but then when I actually got it,

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.180
I realized there was a reason

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.700
why they didn't make one of those

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.820
in the first place.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.820
More importantly is the wider critical

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.420
and cultural overreaction

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.260
to the series and its popularity.

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:43.980
While lots of folks

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.260
have always been super positive

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:45.980
about the series,

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.420
even since Demon's Souls,

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.620
its spiritual successor

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.060
becoming a genuine smash hit

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.660
with a huge swath of players

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.020
has caused lots of games writers

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.460
to kind of go into overdrive

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:55.500
about the series.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.100
I can already predict one comment

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.140
someone paused this video

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.340
halfway through to leave.

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.540
Why did you bring up Thumper

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:01.660
right in the middle of this?

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.020
Thumper's a rhythm game.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:03.740
What does it have to do

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.740
with bloody action, adventure,

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.900
RPG things like the Souls games?

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.340
Well, apart from the general point

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.300
I made about how games

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.340
can engross you,

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:11.900
you're right.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.100
It doesn't really have much in common

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.380
with the Souls series.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:15.500
The main reason I brought it up

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.620
was because when I was reading

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:17.420
reviews of Thumper

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.100
to see what people thought about it,

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.300
I found a review that called it

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.460
the Dark Souls of Rhythm Games.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.900
I could say that calling something

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.260
the Dark Souls of something

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:27.020
or saying something is like Dark Souls

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.220
for the sake of comparison

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.020
and easy clicks

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.860
is just poor and cliche writing,

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:31.900
and it kind of is,

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.340
but it's more that we as critics

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.860
have a duty to communicate

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.380
why something is good.

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:37.660
Thumper has done a disservice

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.540
by being described

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:40.460
as the Dark Souls of Rhythm Games

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.980
because it indicates that we still

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.340
don't have the language

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.300
to really explain

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.660
why something is good

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.780
without having to compare it

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.140
to a singular experience

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.060
that isn't really all that much like it

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.820
when you really get down to it.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:53.820
I remember Yahtzee's Dark Souls review.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.340
In it, he makes this point.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.460
So I'd ask them to explain

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:56.940
why it's good,

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.580
and they'd reply,

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.540
ooh, we can't tell you.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:18:59.820
You just have to find out for yourself.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:00.700
And then I'd say,

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:01.980
shut up or fuck off,

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.500
ideally both in either order.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.020
He kind of skips over it for a joke,

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:05.820
but what he's doing here

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.500
is actually describing the problem.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.460
We as a community

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.260
are sometimes unable

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.220
to really come up with

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.740
why we think something is good

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.700
or we enjoy it,

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.780
and it leaves us having to vaguely

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.140
gesture in a game's direction

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.900
because words have failed us.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.340
It's a hard series to pin down,

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:20.380
I know, trust me.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.980
I've just spent a really long time

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.020
trying to do so

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.060
because when we grapple

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.980
with why we enjoy something,

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.260
we're ultimately interrogating

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.220
our own feelings,

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.500
and that's a very difficult thing

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.460
to do indeed.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:31.500
At least I assume that's why

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.260
my therapist charges so much.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.900
But good criticism means good discourse.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.900
I can completely see why writers,

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.020
critics, and journalists

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.540
use the shorthands they do,

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.140
but I think the onus is on us

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.340
to try not to,

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.940
to be willing to be long,

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:45.820
complicated,

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:46.940
willing to be, yeah,

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.980
even a little bit boring

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.180
or pedantic at times

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:49.980
in order to explore

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.820
the qualities of gaming experiences

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.180
in a truly valuable way,

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.060
which I hope I've done,

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.660
but knowing me, I probably, uh...

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.100
didn't.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.460
For things to fully get judged

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.500
on their own merit,

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.860
we have to start examining

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.300
the actual merits

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.980
in concrete terms.

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:04.460
For the record,

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.140
the most accurate comparison I've seen

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.580
is when Patrick Klepek described

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.940
beating a Mario Maker level

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:09.980
as like the feeling of

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.340
beating a Dark Souls boss.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.500
The point is the level achieved a feeling

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.620
rather than having any

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.060
pure mechanical similarity.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.740
I mean, they're completely different genres.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.580
It's hard to do that comparison right,

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.100
but Scoops managed it.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:21.660
Hmm.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.700
A hard thing to do

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.540
that only a few people achieve?

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.220
I guess that makes Patrick Klepek

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.140
the Dark Souls of Game Critic.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.500
Bloodborne,

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.100
a game about injecting yourself

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.140
with increasing amounts

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.820
of dangerous liquid,

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.460
is itself the ultimate gateway drug.

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.980
The precise beauty

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.820
of the particulars of the experience

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.340
make for a fantastic thing

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:42.300
all on its own.

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.540
But perhaps more importantly

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.980
than being one of the best games

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.180
of its generation,

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.540
it inoculates its players

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.580
against the problems

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.020
the Souls series has previously

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.340
been unable to rid itself for years.

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.260
The previous games were really good,

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.220
but their design

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.740
accidentally necessitated

01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.620
ways of playing it

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.740
that were conservative

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.260
and just not all that fun

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.540
to actually do.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.300
It was, to coin yet another

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:05.900
unfitting food metaphor,

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.580
being handed a very good

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.460
bowl of soup,

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.420
shout-out to soup,

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.660
but being given a shield-shaped

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.180
pitchfork to eat it with.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:14.540
It took a lot of time to realize

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.660
there were more funner ways

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.420
of doing it than it presented itself,

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:17.980
and by then,

01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.740
people had lost their appetite.

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:21.580
Bloodborne is better soup,

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.620
but more importantly,

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:23.740
it's soup that comes with

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.180
a piece of paper that says,

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.700
hey, don't use the shield.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.620
Just find a spoon or some bread

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.820
or just pour me directly

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.540
into your mouth.

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.540
Also, the bowl somehow

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.380
also contains a theoretical

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.540
infinite amount of bad soup

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.580
that tastes awful,

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:38.540
but it's cordoned off

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.820
from the good parts of the soup

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.980
and completely optional to consume.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.940
Okay, I probably should have

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.060
written a conclusion out.

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.420
This isn't doing very good.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.340
What ways do I expect the series

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.020
to be improved on in the future?

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:50.540
Well, I'm honestly daunted

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.340
by the genius

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.780
of the FromSoftware team,

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.540
so I really can't wait

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.900
to be surprised

01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.020
by how they improve on it

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:57.900
in the future.

01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:58.940
At the very least, though,

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.380
I do hope that Bloodborne 2

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.220
comes with complimentary breadsticks.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.180
I can't end the video like that.

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:05.680
I can't.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.180
I can't.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.280
I'd like to say a very special thanks to...

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.040
While the rest of the credits going past, uh, in case you want to know,

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.600
yes, I am planning a Fallout 4 video,

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.600
but it's taking some time because I want to approach it with enough critical distance that

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.640
I give it a proper shot, you know? I want to take my time with it.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.200
So I want to make at least one more long video in this style about something else first.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.000
If you think about it, it took me eight years to make the Fallout 3 video,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.520
and as of November 10th, Fallout 4 has only been out for one.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.880
So give me a little bit, you know?

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.440
The best part about this video being over is I still haven't played Dark Souls 3

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:04.400
or the DLC for Bloodborne because I've been too busy making this video since, like, July?

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.920
This video was supposed to originally come out in October as, like, a Halloween special,

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.080
but I missed that.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.440
So, like, I can finally play video games again.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.360
People who back me get access to bonus videos,

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.440
and also I recorded, like, 24 hours of footage of me playing Bloodborne

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.960
with a friend that I'm going to put out there.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.720
So there's that.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.320
But also I shot a pretty elaborate sketch for this video that I decided to take out

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.640
because I realized it was just complete nonsense.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.120
So that stuff's going to be going up soon.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.040
I really want to put out a bunch of bonus videos.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.600
I've been kind of putting off working on them to get this video out at all ever.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.600
So I feel really bad about that.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.720
So I'm going to put a whole bunch of those things out as soon as I can.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.000
So bear with me.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:06.480
Wow, you sat through all of those?

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.560
That's very nice of you.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.360
If you backed me, I certainly hope I managed to get your name in there.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.400
I always worry if I somehow miss names,

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.480
even though I literally just copy and paste it from a list.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.160
If I've made a huge mistake, let me know.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.120
But as a present for the nice folks who bothered to sit through the credits

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.920
of all the people who allowed me to keep making this stuff,

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.480
I'd like to just throw some game names out there.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.400
Shadow of Mordor,

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:31.040
Deus Ex Human Revolution,

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.160
Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.440
Feel free to write one of those names in a comment on this video

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.360
and see what it causes to happen.
