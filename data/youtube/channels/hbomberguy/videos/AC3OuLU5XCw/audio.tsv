0	2840	I'm going to go out of my way for once and talk about something positive.
2840	5540	I'm going to talk about a game I really, really like.
5540	8740	I'm going to talk about Bloodborne, and why it's amazing.
8740	11420	["Bloodborne Theme Song"]
11420	16720	["Bloodborne Theme Song Fades Out"]
16720	22260	["Bloodborne Theme Song Fades In"]
22260	25180	Okay, to start off, we're going to have to establish a baseline, aren't we?
25180	28180	Bloodborne's amazing, but the Souls series has always been good.
28180	31480	Let's start by talking in basic terms about the core gameplay.
31480	36020	They are, when you boil it down, basically action games attempting to recreate the same sort of stuff
36020	38900	RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons were designed to simulate.
38900	42320	Adventures in magical lands with dungeons and or dragons.
42320	46460	They control in a vaguely similar way to other third-person action games like Devil May Cry,
46460	50040	or Drakengard, or Dynasty Warriors, or even The Legend of Zelda.
50040	55480	However, despite superficial resemblance, in practice, the games operate very differently from those.
55480	61620	All the games I just mentioned here have a focus on instantaneousness, fluidity, and flow or speed.
61620	64900	You press the button, and the character is immediately doing the thing.
64900	70500	Dante is doing the stabby, or the jumpy, or the flippy as soon as you press the button commanding him to do it.
70500	72000	He's such a good boy.
72000	76580	In lots of these games, you can even cancel a move you're currently doing into another move.
76580	80380	So if you realized you actually pressed the wrong button, you can get away with pressing the right one,
80380	83040	and Dante cleans up after your mistakes for you.
83040	85040	It's like McDonald's or Casual Sex.
85040	86500	It's... fine?
86500	88340	You know, like, it'll do?
88340	93080	But outside of higher difficulties, there's this sense of never really earning anything to me.
93080	97220	I hit the relevant button based on when it was clearly telegraphing that I should be doing it,
97220	98640	and then it happened instantly.
98640	100300	It's missing something.
100300	104720	The Souls games are theoretically similar, but choose such a different core design philosophy
104720	109260	that I bet some of you winced when I compared them to character action games the way I just did.
109260	113300	When you press the attack button in a Souls game, you've not just committed to an attack.
113300	118260	You've committed to the long, arduous process of signing the proper paperwork to get planning permission
118260	120380	to start to swing your sword.
120380	123100	You don't immediately see dividends on the button you pressed.
123100	125060	You have to wait for the attack to go off.
125060	128220	On top of that, instead of attacking and moving being an infinite resource,
128220	132060	you have a limited amount of stamina you can invest at any given time.
132060	135280	So you can't rely on mashing the attack and dodge buttons to get by.
135280	138580	And then, if you press the wrong button, you can't hit undo.
138580	141580	You can't cancel out of an attack into the roll you should have done.
141580	143340	You get stabbed instead.
143340	147540	This creates an immediate friction between you and what you want to achieve.
147540	149780	You can't just hit the button when you see an opening,
149780	152460	or dance around and wait until one gets handed to you.
152460	155820	You have to learn to prepare and observe the timing of your enemy,
155820	159020	and be able to know when to act instead of simply acting,
159020	163820	or use your limited stamina resource to create an opening by dodging an early attack.
163820	167260	This is the main reason why the series has always been a little bit divisive.
167260	171340	Its deliberateness puts it directly at odds with almost every other game of its type,
171340	176100	which strive to make actions as quick as possible and give the player tons of control and freedom.
176100	180060	However, it's for this same reason that you might find a Souls game more rewarding,
180060	183620	because there's a genuine sense of having earned a victory once you get it.
183620	185940	The tools you're given for victory are more limited.
185940	190940	You're never going to feel like a badass who can flip all over the place or dodge infinitely any time they need to.
190940	196260	But this makes winning with those more limited tools more satisfying and feel like a real achievement.
196260	202580	There is something on a core level fun about this kind of setup that you don't really get in many other types of game.
202580	205620	It also creates a much deeper appreciation for subtlety.
205620	211060	Each Devil May Cry game, for example, has a huge array of monsters with ridiculously cool-looking moves and stuff,
211060	214540	but there are so many on screen at a time, and it's so easy to actually deal with them,
214540	217020	that there's less of a weight to an encounter.
217020	222820	The game only starts feeling fun on really high difficulties when only a couple of those attacks would kill you,
222820	225900	and you suddenly have to take everything really seriously.
225900	231220	Meanwhile, just this one guy in Demon's Souls could, and generally usually does, kill me.
231620	235500	I've had to put more thought into dealing with the red-eyed knights in Demon's Souls,
235500	240460	or the black knights in Dark Souls, than basically every enemy in a Devil May Cry game put together.
240460	242300	It's just that much more engaging.
242300	247980	It makes every single encounter feel dense with prediction, timing, planning, and execution.
247980	252780	You have to almost consider the psychology of your opponent to know the right time before you get there,
252780	255820	and wait out the time it takes to do the thing you wanted to do,
255820	259820	until you finally discover if you were accurate and everything goes as planned.
259820	262060	There's something beautifully orgasmic to it.
262060	266460	It's like cooking something difficult for yourself and sitting down and realizing you made something good,
266460	267820	and now it's all yours.
267820	273660	Every sliver of health you take from someone's meter was earned through this delicate interplay.
273660	278060	It's so good, writing about it required me to do the thing game critics should never do,
278060	281420	and start using unfitting metaphors for food and or sex.
281420	285260	This stuff is hard to do well, and it really shows in games where it's done poorly.
285260	289260	As an object lesson in bad versions of this, check out Lords of the Fallen,
289260	293100	a game that was very clearly made by people who saw that Dark Souls was popular,
293100	295260	and wanted to make one of those,
295260	300220	but didn't quite figure out that it actually takes a lot of effort to make this kind of game fun.
300220	302780	I've beaten this game all the way through twice.
302780	304220	This game is terrible.
304220	308620	Even the basic sword weapon is so slow and deliberate that it becomes a chore.
308620	310620	There's no light running attack at all.
310620	313020	Your guy just stops dead in his tracks.
313020	318140	The controls are so slow and clunky that I was sure my computer was simply too slow to run it,
318140	320300	but no, this is just how the game moves.
320300	323180	There are fast weapons, but they never escape the damage curve,
323180	325740	and you're basically either pressing the button to immediately swing,
325740	327500	but dealing very little damage,
327500	330540	or dealing more but waiting days for something to connect.
330540	332940	I'm used to a weapon having a light attack, which is quicker,
332940	334620	and a heavy attack, which is slower.
334620	338140	When a weapon has a slow attack and an even slower attack,
338140	341100	the entire feel of the game is broken.
341100	343660	Great swords are basically impossible to use,
343660	347580	except, for some reason, the running heavy attack comes out really fast,
347580	349900	making it essentially the fastest move in the game.
349900	353580	This one move carried me until I discovered the broken shield bash mechanic.
358380	361020	I'm actually starting to worry about the fact I beat this game twice.
361020	362700	I think that says something about me.
362700	367420	Weapons in Dark Souls are balanced so well that you don't even notice until this aspect is missing.
367420	371100	But it isn't just these central principles of control that make the series fun.
371100	374940	What's more interesting is how the world tests your ability to use these mechanics,
374940	380060	and thereby create the very specific feeling of adventure they do better than any other series.
380060	383180	Let's take, for example, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
383180	384220	Maybe you've heard of it.
384220	385420	It's a solid game.
385420	387740	However, a couple of things irked me about it.
387740	391020	One is how there's this constant need to explain itself to you.
391020	394860	Every new concept, or creature, or enemy in the game is explained to you carefully,
394860	396860	and in an easily digestible manner.
396860	401100	When Stalfosses? Stalfosses? Stalfies?
401100	405180	Spawn to attack you, they appear at a safe distance and then jump away.
405180	408620	When a trap is introduced, it's shown to you in a way where you immediately know
408620	410780	its entire path and what it does, and so on.
410780	413900	The game loves to tell you in straightforward ways how it works,
413900	416620	or what's happening, and let you deal with it how you want.
416620	422780	This is, you know, fine, and I guess it's a masterpiece that I've loved my whole life.
422780	424860	It's very fair on the player.
424860	428060	But what I don't like about fairness is how it impacts the sense
428060	430300	that you're supposed to be on an adventure.
430300	433980	Link is trying to save the world by journeying into the heart of darkness
433980	436060	and delivering the temples from evil.
436060	439420	So why are the enemies taking the time to introduce themselves?
439420	442940	And why are the traps making sure you know where they are and what they do?
442940	447020	Evil is playing fair, and always being careful to show me its weak point.
447020	449740	Nothing is ever quite surprising in Zelda.
449740	453820	Maybe, for some types of games, fairness isn't actually a good thing.
453900	457100	In making itself too clear about what's happening and how it works,
457100	459180	it's probably more intuitive and playable,
459180	461580	but it causes it to lack a truly great dimension
461580	464220	of feeling like you're fighting against unknowable odds
464220	466300	instead of being told them all the time.
466300	470620	Looking back, there's something really weirdly sanitized about Zelda games.
470620	474220	What makes the world of any given Souls game so much more interesting
474220	475900	is that it doesn't play fair.
475900	477980	Take, for example, Mimics in Dark Souls.
477980	481260	The only way of learning that there are enemies in the game who look like chests
481260	483740	and eat you to death if you try to open them
483740	486620	is to find one and try to open it and die.
486620	488300	This isn't bad design, though,
488300	491180	like, oh, how dare they not give me the chance to not die there.
491180	492860	It's good design.
492860	493980	Because they've, quote-unquote,
493980	496940	unfairly sacrificed the player's life that one time,
496940	500780	they've thoroughly instilled a sense of paranoia and awareness
500780	503980	and given you an even greater sense of having the odds stacked against you
503980	506460	in a horrible world full of murder and death.
506460	508380	It's not that the game is unfair to players,
508380	511260	it's that the world itself is unfair to people.
511260	514300	Life is unfair in the world of Dark Souls,
514300	517020	and you learn that the hard way by dying in it.
517020	518940	After you get eaten by one Mimic,
518940	522700	before you know it, you'll be attacking every chest you see just in case.
522700	526460	And in Dark Souls 2, you can accidentally destroy a chest if you attack it too much,
526460	529740	meaning your own paranoia can be bad for you if you employ it the wrong way.
529740	532380	It creates a more full sense of paranoia
532380	534940	and being immersed in a world that wants you dead.
534940	537020	And once you make it past a difficult area,
537020	537900	beat a hard boss,
537900	541020	or successfully predict that a chest is a Mimic and destroy it,
541020	544700	you'll feel like you've gained ground against a genuinely dangerous world.
544700	546780	The Souls games don't always play fair,
546780	549340	but that makes besting them feel all the sweeter.
549340	551180	Like a genuine victory, you know?
551180	553980	And that feeling is worth getting killed,
553980	555580	unfairly, a couple of times,
555580	558540	because it creates the sense of there being great odds to beat.
558540	561260	The feeling of triumphing against adversity is increased
561260	564780	when that adversity has already actually killed you at least once.
564780	567900	This is where the idea of the game's insane difficulty comes from.
567900	569500	Not the game's actual difficulty,
569500	571660	but the way they keep introducing you to new elements
571660	574700	by killing you with them to create a specific sense of mood.
575340	578700	The only way to know there's going to be traps in this area in Bloodborne
578700	582380	is to step on this pile of, in retrospect, really conspicuous wood,
582380	583180	hear the click,
584460	585740	and shit yourself.
585740	589180	Or if you're a badass, you can dodge it and then go about your merry way.
590380	593420	The first time you fall for a trap, you're looking for them everywhere.
593420	594940	You've approached the whole game with a se-
594940	595980	Oh, fuck!
595980	598300	You've approached the whole game with a greater sense of awareness
598300	600220	and appreciation for its design.
600220	601900	You'll still get caught in a few traps,
601900	605340	but they'll always feel a bit like you could have done more to see them coming.
605340	607180	By the time you get to Cainhurst Castle,
607180	611980	the battlements have raised floors that look just a little bit like plates for traps,
611980	614060	so I avoided them at all costs.
614060	616860	Now, it turns out that's just what the floor looks like.
617740	622140	Any game that successfully makes you afraid of a quirky pavement
622140	624540	is unquestionably a masterpiece.
624540	628140	It's bred a sincere, visceral fear of your surroundings
628140	629900	based on how they've treated you in the past.
629900	631500	It's- it's wonderful.
631500	635980	The Souls games get into you, like, inside your head,
635980	639420	and all the gesticulating about crazy difficulty melts away
639420	641580	in the face of a fun, unforgiving,
641580	644060	but enriching series of encounters that test you
644060	645820	in ways games rarely manage to do,
645820	647740	an almost internal level.
647740	650460	You stop doing the maths about how quickly your attack goes off
650460	652460	and trying to figure out an opening to move,
652460	654860	and you start to just know the right time,
654860	657500	because all this stuff is so deep in your head
657500	658700	that you don't even have to think about it.
658700	660140	It becomes like an instinct.
660140	664220	The only experience that comes close lately is a rhythm game called Thumper.
664220	666780	It's dark, it's noisy, it's metallic.
666780	668620	It's a world of jaggedness,
668620	669820	like a journey through hell,
669820	672620	riding directly into the mouth of hell, even.
672620	674060	Like, that thing's a boss.
674060	675420	And it's very unforgiving.
675420	678700	You die in two hits, but at a certain point, you stop dying,
678700	682060	because the rhythm, the sound gets inside you.
682060	685420	The line between player and game feels like it's evaporated.
685420	688060	You begin to sense what notes are coming next,
688060	691260	because the music has got into you on an almost instinctive level.
691260	694380	You can't really sell Thumper or the Souls games
694380	696540	to someone based purely on their mechanics,
696540	698220	because the enjoyable thing about these games
698220	699820	is when all these things are so ingrained
699820	702460	that the mechanics themselves seem to fade away,
702460	705420	and you're fully transported into the salviatic nightmare
705420	707020	of sound and sight.
707020	708300	Salviatic.
708300	710620	I just made up a word
710620	713660	attempting to describe the feeling a game gave me.
713660	717260	Generally, generally that's a sign that something good is happening.
717260	720460	Why am I talking about Thumper, a rhythm game, here?
720460	722140	Well, you'll have to find out.
722140	723980	There's probably a reason.
723980	725100	Oh, God, is there a reason?
725100	726380	Shit, did I write that part down?
726380	728300	Oh, fuck, this page is blank.
728300	729500	I'm just...
729500	732940	I'm just fiddling with paper to make it sound like I wrote a script.
732940	734780	Shit, I forgot where I'm going with this.
734780	737980	And now for the reason this video was made.
737980	740700	I know, I make videos on purpose for a reason.
740700	741420	Who'd have thought?
741420	743980	Okay, so I'm pretty into the Souls series.
743980	745740	I saw lots of people playing Demon's Souls
745740	747740	but couldn't afford a PS3 at the time,
747740	749980	got on board with the PC version of Dark Souls—
749980	751020	yeah, that version—
751020	752140	but I really liked it,
752140	754780	and I also really like Dark Souls 2.
754780	755900	Um...
755900	757180	Okay, come on, it's—it's good.
757180	757820	It's—it's—
757820	759580	I later went back and played Demon's Souls as well
759580	761980	and very briefly delved into the precursor series,
761980	765020	King's Field, before realizing they were a bit crap and stopping.
765020	767180	Generally, I'd call myself a big fan.
767180	769980	I could talk for a long time about why the series is great.
769980	772700	In fact, I fully intend to do that right now.
772700	775500	But up until 2015, the series had a problem.
775500	777980	It's the kind of vague problem that's hard to talk about,
777980	780460	especially because I don't actually have that problem.
780460	783820	A lot of people seem not to really be able to get into them and enjoy them.
783820	785980	There's a pretty large group of people who do really like them,
785980	788060	then another group of people who pick every game up
788060	791100	but don't really get too far before getting kind of done with it,
791100	793660	and another group that probably don't really get them at all.
793660	796300	I have a sneaking suspicion that videos about Souls games
796300	797820	get super popular in the first place
797820	800540	because people watch them so they don't have to play the games
800540	804380	or to try to see why other people play something they don't get for themselves.
804380	806620	I have one friend in particular who tried all of them
806620	808220	and just didn't get them at all,
808220	811900	found them overly esoteric and difficult in a way that wasn't fun
811900	815180	and full of overly defensive, get-good, spouting fanboys
815180	817260	and just not all they were cracked up to be.
817260	819020	But then March 2015 happened.
819660	821020	Then Bloodborne happened.
824140	827260	Like the other games, my friend tried this one expecting to bounce off,
827260	828780	but instead he fell in.
828780	830300	He's played a ton of this game,
830300	832060	and I think it's one of his favorites ever,
832060	835180	at least based on how he seems to have finished it like 12 times or something.
835180	836460	But more importantly,
836460	839260	and this is the impetus behind this whole video, to be honest,
839260	842300	he went back to the other games and finally got them.
842860	845340	All of a sudden, he likes those as well.
846220	848540	And this has happened with a couple of other people too.
848540	850940	Some people just don't get the Souls games,
850940	851820	play Bloodborne,
851820	855900	and then suddenly have this deep and abiding passion for the whole series.
855900	860060	So the main purpose of this video is to try and figure out why exactly that might be.
860700	862620	Let's get down to brass tacks.
862620	864780	Let's dig a little deeper.
867580	870860	Did anyone else think The Princess and the Frog felt kind of like it was phoning it in?
875100	878540	Now I want to get into a rather heated and complex question.
878540	880940	Is it possible to play a game wrong?
880940	883180	I think this is genuinely difficult to answer.
883180	885660	People are going to have different experiences no matter what,
885660	887740	and not everyone has to like something.
887740	891820	But part of me also feels that there are right and wrong ways to approach a game.
891820	894460	But what does that mean for people who want to make good criticism
894460	897020	and attempt to analyze the rights and wrongs of game design
897020	899340	if the results are going to be so subjective anyway?
899340	902620	Does game design even matter if you can create the greatest game ever
902620	905580	but some people will just play it wrong and have a bad time?
905580	907900	Well, to a certain extent, that's always going to happen, isn't it?
907900	911100	There will always be people for whom an experience just isn't for them
911100	913740	or who are too dumb to understand how to play something
913740	917260	or don't realize that something they think is good is objectively bad.
917260	919500	Some people really like Fallout 3,
919500	922140	and they seem to be the specific type of people who think
922140	925500	clicking a dislike button is a decent way of expressing their feelings.
925500	928780	In other words, objectively stupid people like Fallout 3.
928780	931660	And there is a right way to play the Souls games.
931660	933500	You can hide behind the shield a lot,
933500	936060	die over and over trying to memorize every encounter,
936060	939420	or use magic from a distance to avoid having to engage with the game
939420	942300	or wear the heaviest armor and hope that'll save you.
942300	945580	But the reality is it's just more fun playing it as someone who dodges,
945580	947100	who weaves, who parries,
947100	950380	and who uses situational awareness to assess a situation
950380	953420	and maybe get out of it the first time without so much trial or error.
953420	954540	It's not that hard.
954540	956780	The Souls games aren't really all that difficult.
956780	959900	You dodge the attack and then you hit them with the stick.
959900	960380	Done.
960380	962780	I just solved all the Souls games for you.
962780	965660	Everything else is just pretentiousness about preparing to die.
965660	966620	I know, that's stupid.
966620	967660	Ignore all of that.
967660	969740	Oh, you think breathing fire is sexy?
969740	971820	Sorry, that's not in this semester.
972780	974540	I'm gonna have to kick you out of the school.
975660	979340	Is it rude of me to say there's right and wrong ways to have fun with a game?
979980	981900	Well, maybe.
981900	983980	But thanks to the magic of face cam,
983980	986620	I can literally see this in effect.
986620	989180	Here's Patrick Klepek painstakingly muscling his way
989180	990620	through the final boss of Demon's Souls
990620	992940	with his shield raised, a magic shield up,
992940	995100	attacking only when it's utterly safe.
995100	997580	When it's over, he breathes a sigh of relief.
997580	1011820	He's glad it's over.
1011820	1014140	He's glad to be done with the game.
1014140	1015500	Was that fight fun?
1015500	1016940	It seemed torturous.
1016940	1019100	No wonder people think these games aren't for everyone
1019100	1020540	if this is how they're playing it.
1020540	1023340	Now, here's Patrick fighting a boss in Dark Souls 2
1023340	1024860	with no easy magic to help him.
1024860	1026300	He doesn't even have a shield.
1026380	1028220	He's dual-wielding maces.
1028220	1030140	Does he breathe a sigh of relief when it's over?
1030860	1033260	Well, I just came back and totally whooped the pursuer.
1037500	1038380	Of course not.
1038380	1042940	Is Dark Souls 2 such a massively more amazing experience than Demon's Souls,
1042940	1047420	or was he just playing it in a way that was less conducive to actually enjoying himself?
1047420	1051820	More importantly, what leads people to play the game one way over the other?
1051820	1053340	It's a difficult concept to deal with
1053340	1055900	because it doesn't concern the mechanics of the game itself,
1055980	1058460	but rather how the game relates its mechanics to the player,
1058460	1059820	which is far more important
1059820	1063820	and defines how the player deals with these mechanics over the course of their experience.
1063820	1067020	I covered this concept briefly in my Fallout 3 analysis,
1067020	1069900	and I realize in retrospect it was the smartest thing I said.
1069900	1074220	The first lockpick and hacking scenarios are immediately next to the means to circumvent them,
1074220	1077660	which accidentally teaches the player not to bother with these mechanics
1077660	1079180	because there's going to be workarounds
1079180	1081980	and the time or point investment is better spent elsewhere.
1081980	1085340	The lockpicking and hacking mechanics themselves are fine in a vacuum,
1085340	1088940	but you've just hamstrung the player's perception of how they surface in the game.
1088940	1091580	When you find the password in the dresser next to the computer,
1091580	1092460	you're not going to go,
1092460	1095900	oh boy, I can't wait to invest in my character's hacking abilities.
1095900	1097900	You think, wow, hacking is for idiots.
1097900	1099420	I'll just look in people's desks.
1099420	1103100	The lockpicking and hacking mechanics themselves were absolutely fine in my opinion.
1103100	1105260	They were perfectly acceptable for this kind of game,
1105260	1108460	but the actual experience of how they're introduced to the player
1108460	1111660	influences how they behave in their interactions with them,
1111660	1114300	and thereby alters the amount of fun they can have.
1114300	1118460	You play games in the manner dictated by the experience of the game itself,
1118460	1120460	and sometimes that manner isn't great.
1120460	1124540	Now, I haven't really seen anyone else writing about this psychological side of design,
1124540	1125740	and believe me, I've looked.
1125740	1129180	Even Game Feel, Stephen Swink's seminal work on good game design,
1129180	1133500	seems mostly concerned with making mechanics that look and feel and play well,
1133500	1136220	but doesn't really consider how a game causes the player
1136220	1138860	to start engaging with them in a way that's fun.
1138860	1140460	And since, from the sounds of things,
1140460	1142860	I'm basically the discoverer of this concept, right,
1142940	1144460	does that mean I get to name it?
1144460	1148460	Well, uh, I'm gonna call it Play Conditioning.
1148460	1149420	Yeah, sure.
1149420	1151980	If you've got a better name or it turns out there's a large body of work
1151980	1154060	dealing with this concept already that I just missed,
1154060	1156620	let me know and I'll go mope in the corner for a while.
1156620	1159980	This is a little different from a more well-known concept called conveyance,
1159980	1163740	which is how a game tells you what its mechanics are and what things do.
1163740	1165740	Play Conditioning, my new made-up term,
1165740	1169820	refers to how players are led to use those mechanics by how the game is executed.
1169820	1172780	I might just be splitting hairs to make it look like I came up with a new concept,
1172780	1175340	but I do feel that there's an important distinction there.
1175340	1179340	Let's take a look at the conditioning at play in the early levels of Demon's Souls.
1179340	1182060	The first boss you encounter has an unreasonably high amount of health
1182060	1183580	and can kill you in either one hit
1183580	1186620	or one and one-tenths of a hit based on your character.
1186620	1189100	And once he kills you, you don't get another shot.
1189100	1191660	You revive in the Nexus where the story properly starts.
1191660	1193260	But even if you do beat it,
1193260	1195900	you advance to this dragon and he kills you.
1195900	1198620	The lesson, no matter what, is you will die.
1198620	1201260	The game's trying to tell you that you're going to fail sometimes,
1201260	1202780	so you might want to learn from it.
1202780	1204940	It's a warning about the game's intense difficulty
1204940	1206700	and the nature of death in this game.
1206700	1209260	Embrace that it's possible and build on your mistakes.
1209260	1211260	The first time I beat the early tutorial enemies
1211260	1214380	and then pass through the fog door to meet this giant hulking monster
1214380	1216780	was genuinely kind of surprising and terrifying.
1216780	1218140	There's this moment of,
1218140	1220300	oh, shit, it's genius.
1220300	1222780	Your almost inevitable death at this guy's hand...
1223740	1224300	things
1224300	1227980	immediately communicates that you're going to be facing seemingly insurmountable odds,
1227980	1230780	which makes succeeding against them all the more satisfying.
1230780	1232780	You run into versions of this boss later in the game
1232780	1235420	and clowning on them after all the experience and weapons you've gained
1235420	1236940	is a reminder of how far you've come.
1236940	1240460	It's pretty good, but getting there requires playing the game for tens more hours,
1240460	1244380	and that's not a particularly good kind of return on your investment.
1244380	1246940	Plus, being killed no matter what at the start of a game
1246940	1249020	isn't exactly all that encouraging either.
1249020	1251580	It kind of has a negative effect on players, I feel.
1251580	1254700	Not everyone's going to enjoy being led into the game in this manner.
1255340	1257980	Okay, first enemy, first boss.
1257980	1258860	What's up, Vanguard?
1261820	1262700	Yo.
1262700	1266620	Do you think this told Patrick he should be fast and frenetic and take more risks?
1266620	1269180	The first real level also embodies this paradox.
1269180	1271020	It's a testbed for the sort of tricks and traps
1271020	1273020	that will be used against you for the rest of the game.
1273020	1275740	It's probably intended to teach you a lot about the game to come
1275740	1278220	and prime you to know what to look for and how to act.
1278220	1281180	This area here has a really obvious enemy just in front of you
1281180	1282540	that you'll be walking towards,
1282620	1285180	but there's a guy also hiding just behind the doorway.
1285180	1287340	Some games don't show you everything easily
1287340	1290540	because the challenge is to see if you think to look for it.
1290540	1292380	Countless enemies are going to hide in places
1292380	1295820	you can't quite see over the course of this game and its successors,
1295820	1298620	but after this one, you know it can happen,
1298620	1301100	and the real challenge is dealing with that possibility.
1301100	1302220	But the problem is,
1302220	1306060	if all of these ways of showing you the game can kill you do kill you,
1306060	1307980	it does feel kind of shit.
1307980	1309500	The game is still really, really good,
1309500	1313580	but it's hard to imagine a beginner who's just started a Souls game for the first time
1313580	1316300	opening up, dying to this section a couple of times,
1316300	1317980	and having a good time doing it.
1317980	1321740	It's possible that it accidentally imbued players with the lesson,
1321740	1323100	this isn't fun or fair,
1323100	1325900	and you should just give up or play it in the most boring possible way
1325900	1327180	in the hopes you survive.
1327180	1328540	Patrick played the game wrong
1328540	1332460	because he was conditioned by the experience to approach it that way.
1332460	1334540	I have to admit that I played Demon's Souls
1334540	1336780	after playing the first two Dark Souls games,
1336780	1339740	so these early sections weren't nearly as excruciating
1339740	1340860	as they would have been
1340860	1344380	if this was my first ever engagement with the series and its mechanics.
1344380	1346460	Dark Souls has this exact problem, too,
1346460	1347820	but it lessens it somewhat.
1347820	1351020	You start, fight easy enemies with a broken sword, no problem,
1351020	1352060	and then BAM!
1352060	1353180	Asylum Demon.
1353180	1355900	He's huge, and he probably kills you the first time.
1355900	1359180	To survive, you have to run past him and through a door to the side,
1359180	1360460	and then, no joke,
1360460	1363500	the first thing the game gives you is a shield.
1363500	1365740	What lesson does this instill to a player?
1365740	1366540	It says,
1366540	1368300	hide behind this to survive.
1368300	1369900	You loop back around and kill the demon
1369900	1372060	by getting the drop on it and having better weapons.
1372060	1373980	It's definitely improvement over the Vanguard,
1373980	1376380	where you get one shot, and then you're done,
1376380	1379260	because you immediately get the payoff of besting the opponent
1379260	1381420	who probably beat you at least once,
1381420	1385020	but by then the game's already kind of told you that shields are the way to go.
1385020	1386940	So it's not surprising that a lot of early players
1386940	1388620	run around with their shield up constantly
1388620	1391900	and don't really play in the kind of active, action-y way
1391900	1394060	that lends to really enjoying yourself.
1394140	1396860	You can see this play conditioning in effect with, for example,
1396860	1399260	Geopp, who Let's Played the game in 2012.
1399260	1401340	He plays very conservatively and slowly
1401340	1404140	and has his shield up even when nothing's around just in case.
1404140	1406540	He's very careful, and it takes him five videos
1406540	1408460	to get to the bonfire in Undead Burg.
1408460	1410060	And once he gets his hands on a spear,
1410060	1414300	he spends a huge portion of the game attacking safely from behind his shield.
1414300	1415740	In the description of the Let's Play,
1415740	1419020	he explains that he played a small bit of Demon's Souls before giving up.
1419020	1420700	In other words, this play style emerges
1420700	1423260	from when you experience the parts of the first two games
1423260	1427020	that seemingly condition you to play the game in the most boring way
1427020	1428300	in order to survive.
1428300	1430700	Something very telling he does is constantly discuss
1430700	1432060	when is a good time to heal
1432060	1433900	because he wants to conserve his flasks.
1433900	1436380	He learned to treat healing like that in Demon's Souls
1436380	1438540	where you could literally run out of healing items
1438540	1440380	and have none and just be screwed.
1440380	1442380	He takes a little while to fully take on board
1442380	1444540	on the instinctive level people play games
1444540	1446940	that wasting some of your Estus isn't a big deal
1446940	1448380	because it's not gone forever.
1448380	1450460	In other words, he's actually suffering in Dark Souls
1450460	1454060	because of the way Demon's Souls taught him to play this kind of game.
1454060	1456940	Critically, the entire Souls series, even Demon's Souls,
1456940	1458140	have done quite well,
1458140	1460620	but plenty of players didn't like Demon's Souls
1460620	1462300	and a few critics did agree with them.
1462300	1463420	Take, for example, Yahtzee,
1463420	1467340	everyone's favorite fast-talking English sweary man
1467340	1469020	who I'm not jealous of at all.
1469020	1469980	So in conclusion,
1469980	1471260	fuck you, Demon's Souls.
1471260	1472300	A challenge is one thing,
1472300	1474780	but trying to break down a fucking cement wall with your forehead
1474780	1475340	isn't a challenge,
1475340	1477260	it's grounds for getting fucking sectioned.
1477260	1480220	That's a pretty emphatic no to what Demon's Souls is doing,
1480700	1483820	I remember people on forums at the time echoing his feelings about it.
1483820	1484780	It's trial and error,
1484780	1486460	the combat is too punishing,
1486460	1488140	it feels overly hard,
1488140	1489980	you have to take it slow to do well,
1489980	1491580	and that just isn't fun and so on.
1491580	1493180	At this point, it's worth mentioning that,
1493180	1495420	yeah, Dark Souls did gangbusters.
1495420	1498460	It got super popular and had a massively committed following
1498460	1501340	many times the size of the one Demon's Souls ended up with,
1501340	1503340	and even Yahtzee came around on it.
1503340	1504700	But hang on a second.
1505500	1507100	Let's check out why.
1507100	1508860	After watching a decent let's play of the game,
1508860	1509980	gone over the wiki a few times,
1509980	1512540	and a six-week preparation with a team of advisors and physical trainers,
1512540	1514060	I was able to break through the wall.
1514060	1516060	And I suppose that's the first failing of Dark Souls,
1516060	1518300	that you need the fucking Cliff's Notes to get into it.
1518300	1520620	It's hard to recommend a game to someone and say,
1520620	1523260	but first, here's all the research you have to do.
1523260	1524860	Because that person's gonna say,
1524860	1527500	you know, you say this game's more fun than Zelda H-Bomb,
1527500	1530380	but Zelda doesn't require me to read any technical manuals
1530380	1531820	or peer-reviewed journals
1531820	1534380	and watch someone else play it for a few hours first.
1534380	1535900	This doesn't mean the game is bad.
1535900	1537980	Dark Souls is a very fun video game,
1537980	1539980	I hope that goes without saying at this point,
1539980	1543340	but that's a heck of a barrier for entry into that fun, isn't it?
1543340	1545660	I'm gonna quickly list the reasons why Dark Souls
1545660	1547500	does better conditioning than Demon's Souls
1547500	1551180	and helped onboard just enough people for it to get the popularity it did.
1551180	1553420	Firstly, the opening I told you about before.
1553420	1555100	You get killed by the Asylum Demon,
1555100	1556940	but you respawn just outside.
1556940	1558460	The rematch is immediate.
1558460	1561980	Instead of being killed and starting with a sense of loss and failure
1561980	1563500	as the beginning of the game,
1563500	1566540	the player is killed, but then gets to take their revenge.
1566620	1570300	Losing, trying again, and winning becomes the expectation
1570300	1572380	instead of, you know, losing.
1572380	1575340	Secondly, there's loads of great quality-of-life improvements.
1575340	1578220	Being hollow, the equivalent of a spirit in Demon's Souls,
1578220	1579820	no longer halves your life.
1579820	1583660	Demon's Souls was made much harder if you ever died and lost your human body,
1583660	1585500	so the player was punished for failure
1585500	1588940	by making it easier to fail until they get a human form back,
1588940	1591340	which is quite a rare occurrence in that game.
1591340	1592940	In Dark Souls, you have the same health
1592940	1596540	and you're free to not feel like you already fucked yourself by dying.
1596540	1600540	So, you have less to lose, so you take more risks and do better.
1600540	1602140	Also, the Estus Flask.
1602140	1604700	You had a finite amount of healing in Demon's Souls.
1604700	1606700	You either found healing items in the world
1606700	1609500	or bought them using souls, which were quite hard-earned.
1609500	1611340	Using one meant it was gone.
1611340	1613660	This made deciding to heal feel risky.
1613660	1617820	Like, if you die now, you basically wasted that healing you just used.
1617820	1619660	This made players less likely to heal,
1619660	1622700	which meant they died more, which meant they had less fun.
1622700	1625980	You could farm souls to buy more, but you know what isn't fun?
1626780	1630300	Farming items just to have enough stuff to get a proper run at the boss.
1630300	1633340	The Estus Flask regenerates every time you die,
1633340	1636860	meaning you never feel like you're actually wasting it because it'll come back.
1636860	1639660	This made players more willing to use their healing item,
1639660	1643180	which made them live longer and do better and have more fun.
1643180	1645100	Those were the main two, in my opinion.
1645100	1647260	There are more, but they're not really worth bringing up here.
1647260	1649740	If I were making a game with Demon's Souls as system of health,
1649740	1652940	I would have made your life bar and soul form your actual life bar
1652940	1655020	and have your health double when you were human,
1655020	1657260	so being human at least felt like a buff
1657260	1661900	instead of simply being able to use all of your health bar for a while.
1661900	1666460	My third reason why Dark Souls feels better is the existence of Demon's Souls itself.
1666460	1668780	I know it's a bit weird, but I think my reasoning is sound.
1668780	1673020	Demon's Souls felt to players like this weird new thing that did stuff differently,
1673020	1675900	and different doesn't always feel good to play.
1675900	1677980	Some aspects felt like active mistakes.
1677980	1680460	Why would they make the game this punishing and hard?
1680460	1683340	Why were there so many weird traps trying to directly kill me?
1683340	1684300	And so on.
1684300	1689180	Dark Souls, by being the second in a series, is viewed differently by its players.
1689180	1692700	Now all the weirdness and differentness and difficulty are justifiable.
1692700	1696620	The fact they did it twice makes it feel like, no, this is all just intentional.
1696620	1701260	Suddenly, bad ideas and weird concepts simply become staples of a series.
1701260	1704620	For a movie example, The Purge had to justify its very existence
1704620	1707580	and its concept to a fresh audience when it came out.
1707660	1712220	But The Purge 2 and 3 didn't, because they were the second and third stories in a series.
1712220	1714780	So even if The Purge 1 is worse than the others,
1714780	1715580	which, yeah...
1719900	1724860	It's worth keeping in mind that it did receive a different critical perspective than its sequels did.
1724860	1727180	Dark Souls has slightly better play conditioning,
1727180	1729980	but it's still quite clearly not that great at it.
1729980	1732780	So it isn't just that Bloodborne is a better game than the others,
1732780	1734780	although that is kinda true in my opinion,
1734780	1738620	Bloodborne changes people's perspectives on a more subtle level.
1738620	1740540	I have a theory about this ga-
1740540	1743100	No, I have a hypothesis about this game.
1743660	1747100	Bloodborne teaches you how to enjoy Souls games.
1747100	1750700	Let me show you just a couple of the design differences that seem small,
1750700	1754220	but have a massive, MASSIVE difference on the mindset of players.
1754220	1755740	Firstly, the most obvious one.
1757660	1758940	There's no shield.
1758940	1760380	Where is it? It's not there!
1760380	1762060	This isn't how these games work!
1762060	1765020	You don't start the game with a shield at all, no matter what.
1765020	1766220	This is genius!
1766220	1766720	This is...
1767500	1770300	It's a spicy meatball of game design goodness!
1770300	1771820	Normally food metaphors are bad,
1771820	1775260	but I can literally taste the design genius here.
1775260	1778860	The shield has been the bane of the Souls series from the very start.
1778860	1780460	It's the true villain,
1780460	1783420	and it's precisely because of its function and use.
1783420	1784060	Let's go back.
1784060	1791980	Ah, the shield. A classic.
1791980	1795660	You hold a button down and you're immediately protected from obvious harm you're facing.
1795660	1796940	There's a parry mechanic,
1796940	1801020	which you can use to make an enemy completely exposed and hit them for way more damage.
1801020	1802300	But why take the risk?
1802300	1803740	You can just block the attack,
1803740	1805340	and then attack when there's an opening.
1805340	1806060	Just wait!
1806060	1807180	You can do a dodge roll,
1807180	1809660	but you're only immune to getting hit for a few frames.
1809660	1811980	Why bother when you can just stand there and be fine?
1811980	1813340	This game's not so hard.
1813340	1814540	Just hold the shield button.
1815260	1817580	Welcome to having a shitty time.
1817580	1821500	The fun, frenetic dodge mechanic and the incredibly engaging parry stuff
1821500	1824700	is immediately foreclosed by a much safer option.
1824700	1826220	Not necessarily better,
1826220	1828380	but for early players, safer.
1828380	1831580	A good deal of players will spend a lot of time with their shield up,
1831580	1832780	playing it safe,
1832780	1835420	waiting for only the best possible moment to drop it,
1835420	1836060	strike,
1836060	1837500	and then bring it back up again.
1837500	1839820	The shields only get bigger and more defend-y.
1839820	1844060	They seem to actively encourage using one more rather than less over time.
1844060	1846620	One reason why early players gravitate towards spears
1846620	1849740	is because you can even use them while the shield is up.
1849740	1852220	It's encouraging the players to turtle up,
1852220	1853580	play very, very slowly,
1853580	1855740	and just not have a good time.
1855740	1858940	This is one major reason why people don't enjoy these games.
1858940	1860540	They tell you you're going to die a lot,
1860540	1862860	and then hand you a means of protecting yourself,
1862860	1864860	and the immediate assumption is that you should,
1864860	1865500	you know,
1865500	1866220	use it.
1866220	1868620	But it makes for boring, slow play.
1868620	1870220	You could try parrying,
1870220	1873660	or just put the shield away and have fun using the other options available to you,
1873660	1875260	like two-handing the sword,
1875260	1878220	but the game doesn't really seem to encourage doing it, does it?
1878220	1880620	No shield means no one is safe.
1880620	1881900	You have to dodge,
1881900	1883820	and your offhand weapon is now a gun
1883820	1885100	whose sole use,
1885100	1887260	unless you spec your character a specific way,
1887260	1888620	is for parrying.
1888620	1889260	Parry,
1889260	1890140	or dodge,
1890140	1891100	or die.
1891100	1893660	No easy, boring path at all.
1893660	1895260	You now have no choice
1895260	1897260	but to play the game the fun way.
1897340	1899100	Welcome to the fun zone.
1899100	1901500	I just, I, I can't believe it.
1901500	1902000	Like,
1903180	1904940	can you imagine being in the room
1904940	1909340	when Hit Attacker Miyazaki was looking at playtest footage of the previous games,
1909340	1911500	and coming up with the concept for Bloodborne,
1911500	1912220	and he was like,
1912220	1912940	hey,
1912940	1913440	hey,
1914060	1914940	take out the shields.
1915660	1916160	Like,
1916540	1917040	what?
1917580	1918460	Nani?!
1918460	1919500	Hit Attacker?!
1919500	1921740	How will people defend themselves?
1921740	1925180	By learning to play the game in a way that's actually fun, mate.
1925180	1926700	That's how Japanese people talk,
1926700	1928220	with that exact accent.
1928220	1929580	No shields, ever.
1929580	1930080	None.
1930540	1931500	Okay, one shield,
1931500	1932540	but it's a joke.
1932540	1936300	Put a joke in the arm description about them engendering passivity.
1936300	1937020	Passivity.
1937020	1938460	God, I can't do this voice.
1938460	1938940	Sorry.
1938940	1941980	Broad strokes, let's think about what lesson these games teach you.
1941980	1944140	Demon's Souls hands you a sword and shield,
1944140	1945420	and then kills you,
1945420	1947340	and tells you you're going to die a lot.
1947980	1949420	Dark Souls kills you,
1949420	1950620	and hands you a shield.
1951180	1952540	Bloodborne kills you,
1952540	1953980	and hands you a blade,
1953980	1954860	and a gun.
1955180	1957740	It's commonly said that the best defense is a good offense,
1957740	1961100	and while I'm currently on trial for taking that concept too seriously,
1961100	1962700	it's certainly true here.
1962700	1964620	It's just genius.
1964620	1967260	It's always been possible to play without a shield.
1967260	1968220	Two-handing a weapon,
1968220	1968780	or dodging,
1968780	1969420	or parrying,
1969420	1970860	has always been viable,
1970860	1973740	and always been more fun and fluid than using the shield,
1973740	1976620	but they're just harder enough compared to putting the shield up
1976620	1978460	that most people don't want to take the risk,
1978460	1980860	and thus end up playing the whole game like this.
1980860	1982860	At which point, how far you get through these games
1982860	1986620	becomes a question of how committed you are to being bored,
1986620	1988700	and there are people who've always played the games like this,
1988700	1990460	but they tend to have needed a long time
1990460	1993180	to figure out this style of play and really get into it.
1993180	1994460	By removing shields,
1994460	1998060	players are funneled into that particular play style far quicker,
1998060	1999580	and what's magical about this
1999580	2002380	is that this mindset carries over to the previous games.
2002380	2005580	The incredible potential of the series is made available to people
2005580	2008220	without the need to figure out that play style for themselves
2008220	2010620	by investing tons of time into an experience
2010620	2012780	that starts out feeling kind of plodding.
2012780	2016540	This is one reason why the early Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 community
2016540	2018700	seems so hardcore and committed,
2018700	2020700	because previously, the only sort of person
2020700	2023420	who would stick with early Demon's Souls or Dark Souls
2023420	2026060	long enough to get to the place where it's actually fun
2026060	2029020	is the kind of person who's willing to invest a lot of time
2029020	2031820	into something that starts out not all that fun,
2031820	2034220	and that takes a certain type of person.
2034220	2037580	The early fan base of the Souls series is a bunch of weirdos
2037580	2041340	because that's the only type of person the series could attract early on.
2041340	2042620	No offense intended here.
2042620	2044700	I'm one of those people, okay?
2044700	2046060	I'm just being self-aware.
2046060	2048780	Without making the experience all that much easier,
2048780	2052540	in fact, by making it harder by taking the shield out,
2052540	2056140	Bloodborne opens up the fun way of experiencing this type of game
2056140	2057340	to more people,
2057340	2059740	and that's just magical, isn't it?
2059740	2060620	Don't you think?
2060620	2062620	I'm still reeling from it, to be honest.
2062620	2066940	Like, what level of genius does a man have to be operating on
2066940	2068140	to be able to go,
2068140	2069580	okay, I've thought about it,
2069580	2073020	and by removing a key aspect of our game series,
2073020	2075180	we're gonna vastly improve the experience,
2075180	2076460	not just of this game,
2076460	2078380	but of all the previous ones,
2078380	2080540	because people will go back and play them that way
2080540	2082460	and have a fucking great time!
2082460	2084300	Like, oh my god!
2084300	2085980	Isn't- I- I'm sorry.
2085980	2088380	I try not to, like, screech too much in my videos anymore.
2088380	2089740	People- people say it sounds fake,
2089740	2091420	even though that is actually just how I talk,
2092380	2093740	but I just can't not.
2094460	2096940	It's- it's so brilliant.
2098940	2100940	Woo!
2100940	2102860	One in, done.
2102860	2104140	Praise the mace.
2104140	2107340	Now, I don't know which Patrick you'd vote for president of the school council,
2107340	2109020	but I already cast my vote early.
2109020	2112860	I have a- a mail-in vote to the- the vidi- video game school.
2112860	2116700	Complementing this just genius system is rallying.
2116700	2120140	If you get hit, that section of lost health lingers there for a while,
2120140	2123020	and you get some of that health back if you hit an enemy.
2123020	2125980	You can theoretically get it all back almost every time.
2125980	2128860	This feels, at first, like a simple gimmick, right?
2128860	2133180	But think about how it impacts the player's sense as they play the game.
2133180	2136460	Now when you get hit, you don't immediately think to back off and heal
2136460	2138620	and just break the flow of the combat.
2138620	2141420	In every Souls game before that, that's the reaction.
2141420	2143100	Now you can keep going.
2143100	2146620	You can take your health back from the guy who hit you.
2146620	2147900	Bloody blimey!
2147900	2152460	Like, now you always have the option of being a little more vicious and getting away with it.
2152460	2156460	It's hugely impactful on the flow and action of combat.
2156460	2159980	Combined with the loss of shields, you're carefully encouraged into a mindset
2159980	2166940	that's just more aggressive and tactile and fun and more big, fun-sounding words.
2166940	2168860	It's not even a huge difference, is it?
2168860	2173500	But it results in an improved approach to combat that's more satisfying for players
2173500	2177660	and which, like not using a shield, carries back over to the previous games.
2177660	2181580	Bloodborne at times feels like a tutorial for how to play the previous ones
2181580	2183900	because even when you take rallying out,
2183900	2187500	killing an enemy before healing is generally a smarter option anyway.
2187500	2191580	You've been forced to get good the way people used to have to be obnoxious
2191580	2194220	and hammer away for hundreds of hours to achieve.
2194220	2198300	The developers of Bloodborne didn't blame players for playing it badly.
2198300	2200860	They blamed the game, and then they fixed it.
2204460	2208540	The other way players subtly influenced is the slight change in the way weapons work.
2208540	2212300	Quick weapons feel responsive and larger weapons feel slower and more deliberate,
2212300	2215980	but there's a genuine sense of weight and power when you pull them off.
2215980	2217980	But the edges have been rough at times.
2217980	2220540	The biggest problem has been the array of weapons available.
2220540	2223260	There are, in my opinion, a bit too many.
2223260	2225500	There's a bunch of different kinds of sword,
2225500	2228620	all with slightly different or majorly different animations.
2228620	2232140	Maces, rapiers, spears, greatswords, ultra greatswords,
2232140	2234780	ridiculous fuck-off big berserk reference swords,
2234780	2238620	battle axes, hand axes, stupid axes, and so on.
2238620	2240380	The variety initially seems fine,
2240380	2242780	but in practice it means you have to figure out and remember
2242780	2245260	dozens of different timings and animations and ranges
2245260	2247580	for both one-handing and two-handing all these weapons
2247580	2250940	in order to know which you prefer or which one is best for each scenario.
2250940	2253020	It's not particularly inviting to players,
2253020	2257100	and did we really need three very similar versions of the same moveset
2257100	2259820	when one would have had more clarity and been less cluttered?
2259820	2263180	Did we really need a bastard sword and a claymore?
2263180	2266780	Bloodborne solves this handily from, like, eight different directions at once.
2266780	2269980	Firstly, there's nowhere near as many weapons, but all of them are unique.
2269980	2272780	There are variations, like the saw cleaver has the saw spear
2272780	2275020	and the Kirkhammer has Ludwig's holy blade,
2275020	2276780	but even they feel different enough.
2276780	2278540	But they don't make you feel like you've lost out
2278540	2280940	on tons of variations you could have experimented with
2280940	2283100	because the weapons all have alternative forms
2283100	2285900	that increase the versatility of each individual weapon
2285900	2287980	and even give you moves that let you switch between them
2287980	2289900	as you're attacking, which is really cool.
2289900	2292300	Every weapon has an amazing amount of moves and uses,
2292300	2293740	but you're never overwhelmed
2293740	2297340	because no weapon is clearly worse or better than any other anymore.
2297340	2299100	I'm looking at you, sword that you get
2299100	2301020	that's the same moveset as a starting sword
2301020	2302780	but is just better for no reason.
2302780	2305100	There's no longer a really obviously better version
2305100	2306620	of the weapon you were already using
2306620	2310140	you now have to switch to later on because it's underleveled.
2310140	2312780	But overall, these changes gently coax players
2312780	2315180	into feeling like the choice they made is valid
2315180	2318620	instead of living in constant fear that they're hamstringing themselves.
2318620	2321020	The saw cleaver can be your endgame weapon,
2321020	2323340	and you can become intimately knowledgeable with its use
2323340	2326300	and never have to worry if you should actually be using something else
2326300	2328380	and the weapons are unique and varied enough
2328380	2331500	that they never feel samey even if you use them for the whole game.
2331500	2334140	If you really like generic swords, there's one in there.
2334140	2336860	It just happens to be able to turn into a cool weapon.
2336860	2340060	The downsides of each weapon are almost always clear and understandable.
2340060	2342620	You know, the Kirkhammer's huge but a bit slow.
2342620	2346300	The sword cane is really quick and has a whip state that has a huge range
2346300	2348140	but it doesn't deal all that much damage.
2348140	2349500	Okay, there is one thing.
2349500	2351740	The Tornatrus is weird.
2351740	2353100	It's actually my favorite weapon.
2353100	2355180	Its alternate form is it doesn't have one.
2355180	2357180	It just becomes briefly electric.
2357180	2359100	It's generally pretty strong and fast
2359100	2362860	and knowing when to take the time to electrify it for even more damage is great.
2362860	2364780	Its downside is really silly though.
2364780	2368140	It has a low durability and it goes down quicker than normal weapons
2368140	2369820	meaning you have to repair it more often
2369820	2372300	by returning to the hunter's dream and fixing it up.
2372300	2376300	But it doesn't deteriorate that quickly and repairing costs next to nothing.
2376300	2377660	It's at worst a hassle.
2377660	2379500	That's not really much of a downside.
2379500	2382540	I get that it's trying to make it a weapon you have to use sparingly.
2382540	2383900	I think that's a neat idea.
2383900	2387660	But in practice, it doesn't lose durability fast enough to be a major issue
2387660	2390460	and it's annoying to go to fix when it does get low.
2390460	2392860	Dark Souls 2 actually had a better system
2392860	2395500	where resting at a bonfire restored your weapons each time
2395500	2397340	and durability was lower all round.
2397340	2399740	So you really did have to take that into consideration
2399740	2403500	and some weapons really could only be used sparingly during a single run.
2403500	2406220	Instead of with the Tornatrus, which is basically a really good weapon,
2406220	2408140	you have to repair a bit more than usual,
2408140	2410460	which is just not a huge downside.
2410460	2411820	I think this would have been even better
2411820	2413660	if they'd ripped off Dark Souls 2 a little more
2413660	2416700	and had durability that comes back when you die every time
2416700	2418140	but goes down even faster
2418140	2419980	so you really did have to pick the times
2419980	2422860	to pull out the Funtime Electric murder death stick.
2422860	2427180	I think maybe the over-the-top dislike some fans exhibited towards Dark Souls 2
2427180	2430700	caused the developers to walk back on ideas that were genuinely better.
2430700	2432380	Okay, I—I—I—I—
2432380	2435660	I could spend a good deal of this video defending Dark Souls 2.
2435660	2441180	In fact, um, I—like half of the script is me doing that
2441180	2444220	but I do have some sense of when a video is getting to be too much
2444220	2445900	so I've cut all those bits out
2445900	2449420	and I'm gonna compile a video looking at the central complaints about it
2450460	2453740	and why all of them are wrong and lies from criminals
2453740	2456860	and I'm gonna put that up in a separate video a bit later on.
2456860	2458780	When that comes up, I'll put the link here.
2458780	2459980	So, okay, cool.
2460860	2461980	Back to Bloodborne.
2461980	2464620	While I have already talked about how great the weapons
2464620	2466940	have always generally felt in Souls games,
2466940	2471420	a couple of attacks and moves still felt just a little bit like traps.
2471420	2474140	Moves you really should not use under any circumstances
2474140	2476620	because you'll never be in a position where they're actually useful
2476620	2477900	or they're just ridiculous.
2477900	2479340	Especially with the larger weapons
2479340	2482140	and the second or third moves of their heavier attack strings.
2482140	2485820	The second heavy swing of the two-handed dark blade is a honeypot,
2485820	2489180	a sexy, powerful trap designed to bait you into being killed
2489180	2491100	for attempting to actually use it.
2491100	2493740	Almost every weapon has multiple swings for its R2
2493740	2494940	even if it shouldn't
2494940	2499580	because how often is that attack gonna get the chance to go off in this action game?
2499580	2502700	Giving players that option will cause them to try and use it
2502700	2505740	and suffer the consequences in a way that doesn't really feel fun.
2505740	2509180	Giving the players the option to do this is inviting them to get killed.
2509180	2511580	Bloodborne makes a lot of subtle changes here.
2511580	2514940	Firstly, the R2 is no longer an attack with second or third swings.
2514940	2517340	It's very definitively just a single move.
2517340	2521100	It takes away the inherent tension of not knowing if you should be mashing R1
2521100	2524540	or doing the strong but slower ones and seeing how many you can get in.
2524540	2527660	It makes it immediately intuitive that you should be doing the quicker attacks
2527660	2529180	and finishing with the strong one
2529180	2532300	or using it when you know a great place for its particular timing.
2532300	2535020	This moveset is slightly more limited than the previous games
2535020	2536060	but in a way that's good
2536060	2537900	because it means players aren't getting bogged down
2537900	2539660	by moves that are actually useless
2539660	2543180	but beg you to keep using them because you technically can use them.
2543180	2545100	So even though you can only do one,
2545100	2546220	if you're given a big window,
2546220	2548940	you can still maximize damage with it by charging it up.
2548940	2551580	However, quick weapons or weapons with different properties
2551580	2553260	aren't hamstrung by this.
2553260	2555740	The whip function of the sword cane doesn't charge
2555740	2557740	and can combo into a second move
2557740	2559420	because as a relatively quick weapon,
2559420	2561580	the idea of doing more than one attack with it
2561580	2562940	isn't inherently a trap.
2562940	2564300	A cute extra thing I've noticed
2564300	2566060	is that with the really heavy weapon,
2566060	2567580	there is a second R2.
2567580	2569820	If you fully charge Ludwig's Holy Blade,
2569820	2572220	there's a second attack that can come out after
2572220	2574220	but only if you fully charged it.
2574220	2575900	I like this move because it's an acknowledgement
2575900	2576780	that if you're in a position
2576780	2579820	where you just fully charged a very slow and deliberate attack
2579820	2581500	and you did just hit someone with it,
2581500	2582780	you're probably in a position
2582780	2584380	where you might as well have access
2584380	2586300	to another slow but powerful move.
2586300	2587260	To my recollection,
2587260	2589260	this is the only weapon with this property.
2589260	2590380	It's really cool.
2590380	2592620	The fully charged R2 is so strong already
2592620	2595420	that it also usually staggers whoever was coming for you.
2595420	2597580	So that second attack is basically a reward
2597580	2600300	for mastering one of the most careful moves in the game.
2600300	2602700	It's also worth mentioning that the weapon upgrade system
2602700	2604540	is no longer a horrifying nightmare
2604540	2607660	where you can make a weapon into a crushing weapon
2607660	2610140	or a fire weapon or poison or magic
2610140	2611340	or an enchanted weapon.
2611340	2614060	Yes, those are both different things in the same game.
2614060	2615660	Or a crystal weapon?
2615660	2618300	Or a mundane weapon?
2618300	2620460	A dark weapon?
2620460	2623660	Half of these options will actively ruin your weapon
2623660	2625900	unless you've built your character a certain way,
2625900	2628780	and the resources you expend doing this are rare enough
2628780	2630700	that you can't afford to waste them.
2630700	2633820	I get nervous whenever I'm at a weapon upgrade screen
2633900	2636860	in a Souls game, and that's maybe not great.
2636860	2638780	Bloodborne keeps the straightforward aspects
2638780	2639580	of the upgrade path.
2639580	2641740	You spend blood echoes and bloodstone shards
2641740	2644620	to make your weapon just generally better and bloodier.
2644620	2646780	But there are also gems that you can put on a weapon
2646780	2647980	to change its properties,
2647980	2649820	but they explain what they do in simple,
2649820	2651340	easy-to-understand ways,
2651340	2653020	and they can just be taken out.
2653020	2654780	So experimentation with weapons
2654780	2657020	is actively encouraged for once.
2657020	2658540	This relatively simple change
2658540	2661100	makes the whole game feel a lot more inviting.
2661100	2663820	You know you aren't going to render a weapon unusable
2663820	2666540	or waste one of the two or three magic stone upgrade things
2666540	2668140	you'll get in the space of playing,
2668140	2670860	and that makes you more willing to experiment and mess about,
2670860	2674220	and that just—it just feels better in a big way.
2674220	2676700	On top of this, the designs of the enemies you fight
2676700	2678060	have themselves been altered
2678060	2680540	to force you to play the game in a more fun manner.
2680540	2681900	Here are some of the generic enemies
2681900	2682940	from the previous games.
2682940	2685500	They like to attack a very specific, simple way.
2685500	2686380	They walk up to you,
2686380	2688700	and then they engage a rather simple attack.
2688700	2690700	More importantly, when they're done approaching you,
2690700	2692300	they kind of stop moving.
2692300	2693820	Dodging backwards is an effective way
2693820	2694700	to get out of their range
2694700	2696620	and free up some time and distance.
2696620	2698700	Lots of bosses behave like this as well.
2698700	2700380	Get out of their range while they're attacking you,
2700380	2702380	and you're in a safe zone of sorts.
2702380	2703980	Fast forward to Bloodborne.
2703980	2705580	Most enemies move very differently
2705580	2707660	in an arguably more realistic manner.
2707660	2709500	When even early enemies attack,
2709500	2711260	they continue moving forward,
2711260	2712860	stumble ahead and stuff.
2712860	2714940	Dodging backwards as early as the main area
2714940	2716300	is a recipe for danger.
2716300	2717580	The game immediately tells you
2717580	2718700	that you have to think harder
2718700	2720460	about how you're dealing with these attacks.
2720460	2722460	The second boss most people encounter,
2722460	2725260	Gascoigne, is intensely good at this.
2725260	2726540	Both versions of this fight,
2726540	2729100	both before and after he transforms into a monster,
2729100	2730620	have attacks where dodging backwards
2730620	2732780	leaves you primed to be attacked again.
2732780	2733660	In monster form,
2733660	2736540	almost all of his attacks launch him further forward.
2736540	2738220	The only way to succeed against this guy
2738220	2739580	is to get good at parrying him
2739580	2741340	or learn to dodge to the side
2741340	2743740	or even forward through his attacks
2743740	2745340	with your momentary invincibility
2745340	2746860	to get in a strike of your own.
2746860	2748620	Or you could keep trying to dodge backwards
2748620	2750780	and complain that the game doesn't let you escape.
2750780	2752300	My first few attempts at Gascoigne
2752300	2754540	were the least fun I'd had in the series
2754540	2756460	because, as someone who regards themselves
2756460	2757820	as a seasoned Souls player
2757820	2760060	where dodging backwards was how I survived,
2760060	2762540	this was the first major stumbling block of the game.
2762540	2764380	It forced me to unlearn a style of play
2764380	2765420	that was, in retrospect,
2765420	2766780	conservative and uninteresting
2766780	2768620	and honestly was worth forgetting.
2768620	2769660	By the time of the attempts
2769660	2770780	where I was close to winning,
2770780	2771740	I was having more fun
2771740	2773900	than any other encounter in previous games
2773900	2775820	because the way I played was more engaging
2775820	2777420	and felt faster and more fluid.
2777420	2779900	I was choosing not to try to escape a skirmish
2779900	2781980	because the enemy wouldn't let me do it so easily.
2781980	2783340	Instead, I was staying close
2783340	2784620	and getting in my own hits
2784620	2786220	and ignoring when I was taking damage
2786220	2787420	because I knew I would get it back
2787420	2789820	just by continuing the fight and hitting them.
2789820	2792380	Defeating Gascoigne is a genuine victory,
2792380	2793500	and once you've done so,
2793500	2795900	you've proven that you're capable of approaching battle
2795900	2798540	in a way that's actually fun and quick and fast.
2798540	2800540	You can't hang back and shoot spells at him
2800540	2802300	and just not learn anything the whole game
2802300	2803820	and be generally bored.
2803820	2806940	You have to, well, learn to play the game
2806940	2809180	the way many people have always played these games,
2809180	2810860	but which doesn't come naturally.
2810860	2812380	I could stop right here.
2812380	2814220	You can already see the point, can't you?
2814220	2815500	When you pick up Bloodborne,
2815500	2816540	the first couple of hours
2816540	2817820	of using these altered mechanics
2817820	2819260	and mastering them train you
2819260	2820860	to play not just Bloodborne,
2820860	2822380	but any game in the series
2822380	2824060	in a manner that's actually fun.
2824620	2826060	After years of hitchhiking,
2826620	2829180	normal people have finally been handed the keys
2829180	2830620	to the Souls games,
2830620	2832140	and that's a really good thing
2832140	2833820	because these games are good.
2833820	2836940	They just previously never quite showed people
2836940	2837820	why they were good
2837820	2840140	or how to play them in a way that felt good.
2840140	2842300	I feel that this is why my friend liked it more
2842300	2844220	and then went back and liked the rest,
2844220	2845900	why people who couldn't get into any of them
2845900	2847100	could get into this one
2847100	2848140	at least a little more
2848140	2850060	even if it still wasn't really their thing.
2850060	2851580	In his review of Bloodborne,
2851580	2852860	Yahtzee says this.
2852860	2855020	"...from software who have been doing one specific thing
2855020	2856220	for about four games now.
2856220	2857580	Fortunately, it's a thing I'm into
2857580	2858540	because I like explorative
2858540	2859820	metroidvania-style gameplay,
2859820	2861020	I like subtle storytelling,
2861020	2862460	I like banging my head against a wall
2862460	2863820	with a scary monster drawn on it."
2863820	2865340	Trying to break down a fucking cement wall
2865340	2866620	with your forehead isn't a challenge,
2866620	2868460	it's grounds for getting fucking sectioned.
2868460	2869980	"...from Demon's Souls to Dark Souls
2869980	2871580	to Dark Souls 2 to Bloodborne.
2871580	2872940	Same shit, different anus."
2872940	2874220	Dark Souls 2 is the third game
2874220	2876060	in a series that began with Demon's Souls,
2876060	2877180	which I was thinking I should go back
2877180	2878140	and try again sometime.
2878140	2879900	Ooh, maybe you should have given Demon's Souls
2879900	2880540	a proper shot.
2880540	2882780	What a fantastic idea, you piece of shit.
2882780	2884780	I'm not actually criticising Yahtzee here,
2884780	2885980	although I guess I kind of am
2885980	2887340	because he didn't give Demon's Souls
2887340	2888380	a fair shot in the first place.
2888380	2889900	I'm using his transition to show how
2889900	2891260	this is just how perception of a game
2891260	2892140	can change over time
2892140	2893500	when it gets iterated upon.
2893500	2895980	This transition and why it happened is valuable.
2895980	2897660	Yahtzee's gone from hating Demon's Souls
2897660	2899260	and thinking it's trial-and-error bullshit
2899260	2900060	that isn't fun,
2900060	2902700	to claiming it's part of a series he really likes
2902700	2905020	and which, in his opinion, are all very similar.
2905020	2907100	Good play conditioning can cause a player
2907100	2909340	to suddenly want to commit
2909340	2911820	to an experience superficially very similar
2911820	2913980	to the one they previously really didn't.
2913980	2915900	This is why Bloodborne is amazing.
2915900	2917980	It's trained people to engage the game
2917980	2920860	in a way that makes the experience worth having.
2920860	2922700	Some games can be a good experience,
2922700	2925180	but not very good at bringing people into it.
2925180	2926300	Isn't it somewhat possible
2926300	2927820	that there are many great games
2927820	2929180	that slip through the cracks
2929180	2931260	simply because they didn't fully prep the player
2931260	2933020	to properly play and enjoy them?
2933020	2935020	Maybe there's a right way to play every game.
2935020	2935740	At the very least,
2935740	2937420	there's a right way to play a Souls game,
2937420	2939740	and Bloodborne finally teaches players
2939740	2942380	what that way is in a straightforward manner.
2942380	2943580	Okay, gonna be honest,
2943580	2944860	that's my core argument.
2944860	2947020	I think I just summarised it in about 40 minutes,
2947020	2948220	which, all things considered,
2948220	2949980	is pretty short for me.
2949980	2951740	But while I'm here talking about Bloodborne,
2951740	2953020	I might as well summarise
2953020	2955580	the less condition-y reasons why it's so great
2955580	2957580	and get more into the general reasons.
2957580	2959500	Let's talk about the rest of the stuff.
2964140	2965900	The Souls games in general, except for two,
2965900	2967420	have this tendency to not really
2967420	2969660	have an interesting story to me personally.
2969660	2970380	They're like,
2970380	2971740	oh, you have to stop the king.
2971740	2974140	He went bad and or mad.
2974140	2976220	All the characters you meet are mostly hangers-on
2976220	2978620	who are also messing about in this doomed world.
2978620	2979900	They tend to be interesting,
2979900	2981820	but I could honestly take them or leave them.
2981820	2983420	The story's extra wrinkles feel like
2983420	2985820	they don't really add any value to the experience itself
2985820	2987580	and are more just interesting stuff
2987580	2989100	you can write wikis about later.
2989100	2991100	There's an overall sense that all the fun stuff
2991100	2993180	in the story has already happened,
2993180	2994940	and while it was probably interesting
2994940	2996380	and it's cool to find out about,
2996380	2998860	the player is essentially given a walking tour of a world
2998860	3001100	where all the cool stuff has already happened.
3001100	3003580	All the major players in the story are either dead
3003580	3006140	or hanging out waiting to be killed by you.
3006140	3007340	Bloodborne is interesting
3007340	3009500	because you're not on any singular quest.
3009500	3012380	No one tells you to kill a bunch of people to do this stuff.
3012380	3013580	The game even makes a joke
3013580	3015420	about how unnecessary the story is,
3015420	3018300	but the dude's unwillingness to share the truth with you
3018300	3019500	is actually a clever setup
3019500	3022700	for how this guy is maybe himself not super trustworthy.
3022700	3025500	The story is happening at you instead of in the past.
3025500	3027020	You're actively trying to uncover
3027020	3028620	what's happening as you play,
3028620	3030620	not because it might be interesting
3030620	3032300	to find out about in general,
3032300	3033980	but to have a grip on what's happening
3033980	3036940	and what result my actions are having on the world.
3036940	3038940	There's a real sense of time passing
3038940	3040140	over the course of the game
3040140	3041340	as the night progresses
3041340	3042940	and the people locked in their houses
3042940	3044540	get more worried or sicker
3044540	3047180	or begin to transform into monsters themselves.
3047180	3050540	There's this game called Ocarina of Zelda Legend of Ti-
3050540	3051340	Wait.
3051340	3054140	There's this game called Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
3054140	3057180	and in it, there's this place called Hyrule Castle Town.
3057180	3059260	It's a small and simple area,
3059260	3060620	especially by modern standards,
3060620	3063260	but there's so much character and life to it.
3063260	3065020	Even for an N64 game,
3065100	3067500	there are cool stores and side quests
3067500	3069820	and just people hanging out having a good time
3069820	3070780	and that music.
3071820	3073820	It feels like a place full of life.
3073820	3075500	One thing games like Dark Souls lack
3075500	3077820	is this idea that there's even a world
3077820	3079820	worth fighting for somewhere.
3079820	3083180	The entire world of the games are empty nightmares
3083180	3085180	populated only by the dying,
3085180	3086060	the dead,
3086060	3087180	the undead,
3087180	3088140	the mad,
3088140	3088860	the sad,
3088860	3089900	the monstrous,
3089900	3091980	and Scottish people.
3091980	3094860	Link is being told he's supposed to help Zelda save the world
3094860	3096540	and he is a world worth saving.
3096540	3098380	Hyrule Castle Town stuck with me,
3098380	3100620	mainly because when you pull out the Master Sword
3100620	3103100	and time advances and you go outside...
3118940	3120620	It's become this horrible place.
3121500	3124060	Only three things in this era of gaming
3124060	3127100	ever gave me genuine chills of fear.
3127100	3129340	The terrifying werewolf monster thing
3129340	3132380	that attacks you out of nowhere in Castlevania 64,
3132380	3134940	the landmine with eyes in Banjo-Kazooie,
3134940	3137180	which legitimately scared me a lot as a kid,
3137900	3139500	and coming out of the Temple of Time
3139500	3141580	to discover that the lovely, happy town
3141580	3143900	had been reduced to this.
3143900	3145740	It shocked my tiny mind,
3145740	3147500	seeing it just change like that.
3147500	3150700	That ability to imbue a sense in a player about a place
3150700	3153820	is really important, I think.
3153820	3155340	Now, Bloodborne doesn't have a section
3155340	3156780	where you see what the town was like
3156780	3158140	when things were nice,
3158140	3160940	but by starting just a little bit off-kilter,
3160940	3163260	just a little bit covered in monsters,
3163260	3165660	you see that there is something worth saving in there,
3165660	3167580	and as those things start to disappear
3167580	3169580	and things take a Lovecraftian turn,
3170220	3172140	there's that same sense of loss
3172140	3173900	that things have gotten so much worse.
3173900	3175180	And I love Lovecraft.
3175180	3177340	He was my favorite author when I was 14
3177340	3179980	until I noticed that no one was actually impressed
3179980	3182540	when I would say sanguine instead of red.
3182540	3184940	In retrospect, he's not as great a writer as I remember,
3184940	3186380	and he's kind of one-note,
3186380	3187980	but his writing has inspired a wealth
3187980	3190380	of fantastic designs and stories over the years
3190380	3192540	that take liberties the way he didn't
3192540	3195180	and maintain the same sense of terror at the unknown
3195180	3199420	while having other less-secretly-super-racist stuff in there, too.
3199420	3201980	And Bloodborne is one of those fantastic stories.
3201980	3204140	It has a sense of cosmic terror
3204140	3205900	that only appears in the third act,
3205900	3208060	but when it comes, it comes in a big way,
3208060	3210620	making it super surprising and harder-hitting
3210620	3212540	than it would have been if it had started out that way
3212540	3214460	or been super predictable about it.
3214460	3215980	Oh, it's horrible.
3215980	3217420	Birth imagery. I hate it.
3218140	3220220	The world design is great as well.
3220220	3221900	Okay, Dark Souls.
3221900	3223100	Interconnected world.
3223100	3225500	Lots of alternate paths and secret ways into other areas.
3226220	3227180	It's great.
3227180	3228940	But you know what sucks?
3228940	3230780	Backtracking all the way across it again
3230780	3233340	because you died and there's no bonfire anywhere near it.
3233340	3235340	Too much time is spent walking back and forth
3235340	3237020	through areas you've already visited,
3237020	3239020	and the world never really changes,
3239100	3241260	so you're seeing the same area over and over,
3241260	3243500	except sometimes you're seeing it backwards.
3243500	3246860	I know the entirety of Dark Souls' world like the back of my hand.
3246860	3249260	That's not because it's super memorable or interesting,
3249260	3251820	but because I had to walk through all of it a lot
3251820	3254860	to get to newer places or because I died again.
3254860	3257500	Demon's Souls, in my opinion, was actually better.
3257500	3259500	There's basically no backtracking.
3259500	3260940	There's no interconnectedness either.
3260940	3262860	Each archstone takes you to a different area,
3262860	3265500	and you go in a linear path to the end and then leave.
3265500	3269020	It doesn't have pretensions of being interconnected or one big world
3269020	3271420	and instead focuses on making levels that are interesting
3271420	3273900	and engaging to play through the very first time.
3273900	3276220	Demon's Souls is a little bit harder than Dark Souls
3276220	3278700	because the creators of Dark Souls at some point realized
3278700	3280460	that people would be fighting through each level
3280460	3282300	several times forwards and backwards
3282300	3284620	and eventually people would just want to run past most of it
3284620	3286380	to get where they were trying to go.
3286380	3290140	So they designed areas where running away tended to work out pretty good.
3290140	3294300	Demon's Souls is almost hard-coded to destroy you if you try that shit.
3294300	3298220	But the trade-off is the encounter itself is more challenging and rewarding
3298220	3301580	because it's designed to be approached once from one particular direction.
3301580	3304380	I will take good level design over an open feeling world
3304380	3308300	I'll have to backtrack through constantly every single time.
3308300	3311900	The best areas in Dark Souls, Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo,
3311900	3313900	don't really interconnect with anywhere
3313900	3318380	and instead they're mostly a straight shot from where you start to meeting the boss.
3318380	3320620	It's the best area precisely because,
3320620	3323260	since the developers only intend for you to fight all the way through it
3323260	3324940	once in one direction,
3324940	3329180	it feeds you encounters precisely primed to challenge you in a specific way
3329180	3330460	instead of having to be designed
3330460	3333180	so you could come through in any direction to go somewhere else
3333180	3335580	which loosens what you can really do.
3335580	3339820	Anor Londo feels a bit like a remake of some sections of the Boletarian Palace
3339820	3342460	and I wish more sections were willing to be more linear
3342460	3344860	and just be more interesting that first time.
3344860	3346780	Fighting your way back out of Blighttown
3346780	3349500	or running all the way back through the door Havel's guarding
3349500	3351660	just to get to the Darkroot Basin is annoying
3351660	3353340	and just generally uninteresting.
3353340	3355580	Especially when it's for the eighth time.
3355580	3358620	I'm still in a dream...
3359820	3361420	Dark Soul...
3361420	3363500	Darkroot Basin in general feels kind of dumb.
3363500	3366140	It's just a big area mostly empty of stuff to deal with
3366140	3368620	with some kind of simplistic enemies dropped there.
3368620	3371660	If I wanted to have a bad time running through a mostly empty world
3371660	3373420	I would just play Monster Hunter.
3377420	3380140	The Darkroot Basin also has the most dumb boss in the game
3380140	3382300	who has two attacks they do over and over
3382300	3384780	and which basically miss even if you're standing still.
3385340	3388940	Bloodborne combines both of the best elements of each game.
3388940	3392380	It's never got any areas that are too open and have nothing in them.
3392380	3394940	Even areas taking place in the forest are dense
3394940	3397180	with well-made and challenging encounters
3397180	3399500	and let's not forget actual traps
3399500	3401580	that seem like they were laid out for a person.
3402780	3404060	Jesus! No! No!
3404060	3410540	Oh, I saw it just as I stepped on it.
3412780	3415100	Backtracking is reduced because there are more lanterns
3415100	3416780	and while areas are interconnected
3416780	3419580	many sections are essentially straight shots to the next area
3419580	3421660	with short side paths containing items.
3421660	3424460	So you have a big open world that feels interconnected
3424460	3426780	but surprising amounts of linearity.
3426780	3429020	So you can have areas like this that only work
3429020	3430780	if you're approaching from one direction
3430780	3433260	so all these enemies are actually waiting and hiding for you
3433260	3434300	and shoot at you.
3434300	3436220	Coming back through this area would be weird
3436220	3438060	but you never have to think about that
3438060	3439420	because you never have to.
3439420	3441340	You can teleport around easily.
3441340	3443660	There's quite a delicate sense of linearity
3443660	3445900	and traveling across areas you've already visited
3445900	3449180	because you have a key or some new thing has been unlocked by your actions
3449180	3451980	and thanks to a mechanic I'm going to call the knight
3451980	3454460	where an actual story progresses as you kill bosses
3454460	3457180	and the effects of your growing pool of insight too.
3457180	3459980	Even pre-visited areas are a little bit different
3459980	3461900	either visually or otherwise.
3461900	3464620	Enemies change around, get glowy scary scythes
3464620	3467900	and red versions of sticks
3467900	3469500	or just go to sleep.
3469500	3471660	So the experience of going back through Cathedral Ward
3471660	3473260	to go to a new area is valuable
3473260	3476540	because it's changing and you're seeing things being different.
3476540	3479180	You're not just revisiting it or going through it again
3479180	3481500	but backwards to get to the next new area.
3481500	3483900	Okay, also co-op isn't garbage anymore.
3483900	3486780	Trying to summon friends in these games has always been super annoying.
3486780	3488460	You have to hope you're on the same server
3488460	3490700	or the servers are even up anymore.
3490700	3492940	You have to go human or consumer humanity
3492940	3494860	and sit at the bonfire and go human
3494860	3496860	and hope you see their summon sign
3496860	3500300	and then maybe you'll summon someone to help with Ornstein and...
3501420	3502300	Smeg.
3502300	3504620	But as you can tell from this footage it didn't work
3504620	3506300	and I died on the way to summon Solaire
3506300	3508220	and I didn't have any humanity left to try it again
3508220	3509580	so I had to do it myself
3509580	3511900	and by do it myself I mean get fucked.
3511900	3515260	Also being human makes it so you can be invaded by other players.
3515260	3516540	You know what sucks?
3516540	3518140	That becoming human,
3518140	3522300	the thing you do if you need help with something you're having trouble with
3522300	3526060	is also the thing that invites in more people to gank you to death.
3526060	3527740	Like, no thanks.
3527740	3530860	I can see the idea of it being cool and risk-reward
3530860	3532300	but it's actually shit
3532300	3533740	because it means you can be invaded
3533740	3536620	before you even get to find someone you can summon
3536620	3539580	and if I'm summoning at all I'm already having trouble.
3539580	3543020	Bloodborne's co-op feels like it was actually made by people
3543020	3546060	who assumed other people might want to use it.
3546140	3548780	There's no human or inhuman state anymore.
3548780	3552540	Instead, if you need a hand, you ring the please help me bell.
3552540	3555180	Uh, in Britain we're actually all given one of those at birth.
3555180	3558700	And if someone else is ringing the help people bell
3558700	3560540	they're pulled in to give you a hand.
3560540	3563900	It's simple and you don't have to mess about looking for signs anymore.
3563900	3566300	Only after summoning can you get invaded
3566300	3570620	so you have someone helping you with the area you're obviously finding difficult
3570620	3572620	and the new person coming to get you
3572620	3574700	at least definitely has to deal with two of you
3574700	3576380	which seems a bit more fair.
3576380	3578300	And if you want to co-op with a specific person
3578300	3581020	you can both enter a password of your choosing and go.
3581020	3583980	Also, insight seems to be a less rare resource
3583980	3585500	than all the others in previous games
3585500	3589500	so it's less likely you're gonna run out of your ability to ask for help
3589500	3590940	which is a really good idea.
3590940	3594780	Oh, and since insight is tied to certain enemies getting harder
3594780	3597100	if you need a lot of help you're lowering it
3597100	3599260	so things will eventually let up.
3599260	3601100	Not much, but it's nice.
3601100	3602380	It's really nice.
3602380	3603580	Also, the sound design.
3603580	3605660	It's just brilliant.
3605660	3606220	Everything.
3606220	3607340	The monster howls.
3607340	3610780	The trick weapons clicky-clacking into their alternate forms.
3610780	3613660	The thunderous pounding of the machine gun.
3613660	3617180	The squelching of the monsters getting slit up by me.
3617180	3618460	The extra diegetic
3619180	3621740	that plays when you parry someone successfully.
3621740	3626060	The squeal of the tonitrus as it comes alive and thirsts for crime.
3626060	3627260	It's all great.
3627260	3630140	I hope the sound designers get to write a book about the work they did
3630140	3632380	making this game feel so great.
3632380	3634380	And in 10 years, once I know enough Japanese
3634380	3636620	to be able to comprehend basic sentences
3636620	3638140	I'll even be able to read it.
3638140	3640940	The key thing that proves the power of the sound in this game
3640940	3643820	is that these crow enemies are like regular-looking crows
3643820	3645100	if a bit oversized.
3645100	3647820	They attack by fluttering at you with their wings.
3647820	3649580	But they do this when they attack you.
3651980	3653660	These crows are a nightmare.
3653660	3655340	They hide in just the right places
3655340	3657820	and they make just a loud and horrifying enough noise
3657820	3661180	that it never feels like they're an easy enemy to deal with.
3661180	3663340	They're always just scary.
3663340	3666620	They even come close to the fucking landmine.
3667340	3668620	Fucking Jesus Christ.
3668620	3669820	It's just great stuff.
3672060	3675420	There's a section in Yahoo! Ghoul where I just had to stop and listen.
3675740	3679260	There's ominous, distant, pseudo-diegetic chanting,
3679820	3682700	vague screams and cries in the distance.
3683340	3685980	It's really quite something.
3686700	3689900	I don't like describing games as atmospheric
3689900	3692060	or dripping with atmosphere or anything like that.
3692060	3693420	That feels kind of like a cop-out.
3694300	3698460	But even attempting to describe the feeling of standing still in an area
3698460	3701100	has caused me to slip into this really subdued tone.
3701660	3705020	To me at least, that says something about the game's ability to communicate.
3705420	3708540	It says something about the game's command and attitude.
3709260	3712700	Also, because I'm standing in an area where I just cleaned out a bunch of enemies,
3712700	3715020	ghosts keep appearing and shooting in my direction
3715020	3717500	because they're still fighting them, and I think that's kind of funny.
3717500	3720860	Okay, finally, the big monster boss fights.
3720860	3723660	Souls games are bad at these, in my opinion.
3723660	3726460	I get it, a lot of people like the Gaping Dragon and think he's cool
3726460	3728460	and there's a, you know, they're interesting-looking.
3729100	3733020	But in my opinion, they're not that great to fight, which is the important bit.
3733020	3734860	I often refer to as the dudes-in-armor argument
3734860	3739100	that Souls games feature too many enemies that are just dudes in armor.
3739100	3742940	But in fights, monsters and the big, cool, weird enemies
3742940	3746540	don't react in a manner that makes sense to me as a player.
3746540	3749020	Human enemies respond when you hit them with your sword,
3749020	3753020	but Sif, for example, doesn't seem to even flinch most of the time.
3753020	3757420	Even the final boss flinches when you hit him, so you at least know it's working.
3757420	3761660	I am making some of the mightiest swings you can possibly imagine right now
3761660	3764620	using my character, who incidentally I named Brexit,
3764620	3766700	and she's like, eh, whatever.
3766700	3768860	I'm gonna continue moving like it's a normal thing.
3768860	3772380	No selling all my best moves, just like all the other women in my life.
3772380	3774380	Even Sif is negging me.
3774380	3775740	And suddenly she's limping.
3775740	3777340	I mean, oh, it's so sad.
3777340	3779420	Oh, it's a sad dog, etc.
3779420	3781900	But where was this kind of reacting before?
3781900	3785260	And you can't parry monstery enemies of any kind either.
3785260	3788060	It took me major trial and error for me to even determine
3788060	3791100	if you could parry the Snake Men in Sen's Fortress.
3791100	3794380	By the way, the answer is yes, but only some attacks.
3794380	3799740	The Dark Souls wiki even has an extensive list of what creatures you actually can parry
3799740	3801500	and what attacks you can parry.
3801500	3804460	I get that not everything you're fighting is technically humanoid
3804460	3808300	or has a weapon that you can parry in a traditional sense,
3808300	3811100	but it still feels really lacking in my opinion
3811100	3813980	that you can't use one of the most interesting mechanics in the game
3813980	3815820	against, like, half the enemies.
3815820	3818300	You can kind of parry monsters' attacks.
3818300	3820140	It causes them to do a bit less damage,
3820140	3821820	but seriously, what the fuck?
3821820	3823500	If you have a pseudo parry mechanic,
3823500	3825100	just let me fucking parry this guy.
3825100	3825980	Jesus.
3825980	3828460	The timing is often incredibly hard.
3828460	3831500	Like, literally harder than putting your shield up or dodging,
3831500	3834780	and all it does is cause you to take reduced damage?
3834780	3836620	Like, what?
3836620	3839260	Bloodborne finally sorts that shit out.
3839260	3842300	It makes monstrous enemies react better to being attacked,
3842300	3844780	even bosses, where you can suddenly do cool things
3844780	3846860	like break individual limbs.
3846860	3849500	When you finally topple Dark Beast Pal to the ground
3849580	3851820	because you knocked him so completely off balance,
3851820	3854140	there's a real sense that you've gained an upper hand
3854140	3857020	and rattled his...bones.
3857020	3860540	On top of that, you can now parry most of these enemies.
3860540	3862860	Even bosses can often be parried.
3862860	3865340	That's what let me finally beat the blood-starved beast
3865340	3867660	after an embarrassing amount of attempts.
3867660	3870540	I personally never got bored with dudes in armor.
3870540	3872780	Like, that was just the most fun type of fight
3872780	3874300	in the Souls series thus far.
3874300	3877020	It wasn't broken, but Bloodborne fixed it
3877020	3879340	by coming up with many different kinds of monster,
3879420	3881660	but making the fights feel super responsive
3881660	3883020	to your actions within them.
3883020	3884540	I haven't played Dark Souls 3 yet
3884540	3886460	because I wanted to make this video first,
3886460	3889500	but I hope that if it does have more monstery-type enemies,
3889500	3891580	it has this kind of responsiveness also.
3891580	3895020	I would honestly prefer to have even more dudes in armor
3895020	3898140	than bad dogs or bad rats.
3898140	3899820	Oh, no, not that! No!
3899820	3902700	Okay, also, the blood vials is just a great healing system.
3903420	3904700	Or just all the way through.
3904700	3906700	Like, I talked before about how the Estus Flask
3906700	3907740	is really, really good
3907740	3910060	because it's an infinite source of health,
3910060	3912700	but the trade-off there is there aren't any items
3912700	3914620	you can then also use for healing.
3915260	3917500	You just have that finite resource.
3917500	3919340	What I quite like about Bloodborne's system
3919340	3921660	is you have a lot of healing items,
3921660	3922780	but they're finite.
3922780	3925260	You have enough that it's not ever a huge problem,
3926060	3928460	but you can theoretically run out.
3928460	3930140	So it becomes more like,
3930140	3932220	but you always have enough vials to get your health back
3932220	3933740	almost all the way after an encounter
3933740	3934860	so you can keep going.
3934860	3935900	But on top of that,
3936780	3938940	you are really likely to pick blood vials up
3938940	3940780	as you go in fights with people.
3940780	3942380	For example, in this section, I lose a ton of health,
3942380	3945020	but I get all the vials back as a result of the fight,
3945020	3946460	so it feels balanced.
3946460	3947740	And since they don't always drop,
3947740	3950060	I am eventually supposed to get better.
3950060	3951100	I don't, but still.
3955660	3957820	One issue in Demon's Souls that kind of made it broken
3957820	3959420	was you could, at a certain point,
3959420	3961420	buy a hundred of the best healing item
3961420	3962620	and just carry them around
3962620	3964380	and basically be invincible.
3964860	3967420	Which, I mean, is maybe a problem
3967420	3968780	if a game is supposed to be challenging.
3969420	3971340	Bloodborne kind of fixes it
3971340	3972940	by giving you a really good healing item
3972940	3974140	and giving you quite a lot,
3974140	3975580	but having an upper limit on how many
3975580	3977100	you could ever possibly have.
3977100	3980140	So I feel like Bloodborne might have perfected the system
3980140	3982220	by giving you a lot of a finite amount of thing.
3982780	3985500	However, it is possible to run out
3985500	3986860	and have to farm for them,
3986860	3988540	which isn't so great.
3988540	3989740	In my opinion, they could have had it
3989740	3992780	so you always start with 20 or even 10 blood vials
3992780	3995260	and continue to pick them up the way you do now.
3995260	3996860	But that would completely take away the idea
3996860	3998380	of being able to stock up on them
3998380	3999980	and use them like a regular item
3999980	4001020	and sell them and stuff,
4001020	4003020	so maybe there's a reason why they didn't do that.
4003020	4005500	I mean, maybe the game designers did stuff on purpose.
4005500	4006220	I don't know.
4006220	4008380	Blood vials also heal a set percentage
4008380	4009900	of your maximum health,
4009900	4011900	so they're always a useful source of healing,
4011900	4013980	unlike, for example, the Crescent Moongrass,
4013980	4016060	which is just piss.
4016060	4017500	Also, you heal a lot faster.
4018700	4020220	In previous games, they wanted healing
4020220	4021740	to be like this risk-reward thing
4021740	4022940	where you stop,
4022940	4024300	so if you want to heal,
4024300	4027020	you're taking a huge risk in leaving yourself open.
4027020	4029500	But it seems like they settled in Bloodborne
4029500	4030620	of having it be a really quick thing
4030620	4032060	you can do almost any time
4032060	4033820	and just forgiving you for that.
4033820	4034780	And that's okay.
4034780	4036860	Maybe it theoretically makes it less challenging
4036860	4037660	in some ways,
4037660	4038940	but it's worth it
4038940	4041100	because it means you don't die while healing,
4041100	4043020	and that just feels bad,
4043020	4044220	even if it's your fault.
4044220	4045420	But since they took that out,
4045420	4047500	now you only ever die because you failed to dodge
4047500	4048700	or because you were attacking
4048700	4049580	when you shouldn't have done,
4049580	4051580	and that, I think, feels a lot better.
4051740	4056060	🎶
4056060	4058700	There are still some criticisms I have of Bloodborne, though,
4058700	4061580	where it falls short or seems to take a step back.
4061580	4062780	Here's a kind of big thing.
4062780	4065820	I'm a little disappointed by the NPC encounters.
4065820	4068540	The NPCs in Souls games have about as much health as you,
4068540	4070620	or at least an amount that seems fair.
4070620	4072700	However, they can do things like heal.
4072700	4073740	It's fun and cool,
4073740	4074860	and there's back and forth,
4074860	4076460	and it's just always neat.
4076460	4079020	I like the garden leading up to the Sith boss fight quite a lot
4079020	4081180	just because of all the cool, unique NPCs
4081180	4082460	that come to wreck your shit,
4082460	4084860	including Man With Inferior Jump Attack.
4084860	4086140	Aw, there, there.
4086140	4087580	🔔
4087580	4089980	An idiot who forgot that arrows move in slow motion
4089980	4091260	in Dark Souls Land.
4091260	4094220	And oh, wow, Patrick Klepek's Demon's Souls character
4094220	4095180	is here, too.
4095180	4097100	And if you really like fighting characters
4097100	4098780	with similar abilities to you,
4098780	4101100	there's a cat who wants to help you protect the garden
4101100	4103260	from other real human players.
4103260	4105020	If you join their covenant and wear their ring,
4105020	4107100	occasionally you get summoned in as a blue phantom,
4107100	4110460	so you, yes, you can get backstabbed from ten feet away
4110540	4113500	and wonder if PvP will ever fucking work in these games.
4113500	4115820	In Bloodborne, stray hunters and hunter-sized bosses
4115820	4117260	have obscene amounts of health.
4117260	4118940	This puts you at a massive disadvantage
4118940	4121260	and does away with the feeling that you're fighting an equal
4121260	4123260	and instead fighting a boss version
4123260	4125500	that doesn't really play by the same rules as you.
4126700	4128540	Stop shooting me!
4128540	4129820	Oh, my God!
4129820	4131500	None of them can heal like you can,
4131500	4133020	which kind of balances it out,
4133020	4134460	but it doesn't feel right.
4134460	4135660	Actually, no, some of them do heal
4135660	4136780	and they get back a ton of health,
4136780	4138060	and it's kind of messed up.
4138060	4140300	I know it's possible to get in and make sure they don't,
4140300	4142220	and it's more challenging for them to have more health,
4142220	4144300	but it's not challenging in a way that's fun.
4144300	4145420	It feels off.
4145420	4147340	In my opinion, these fights would be better served
4147340	4149260	if they had an equivalent amount of health as you
4149260	4151340	but could get their health back from rallying like you
4151340	4153180	and would heal themselves in a pinch.
4153180	4154780	They'd be more interesting back and forth
4154780	4155740	like in the previous games,
4155740	4158300	and it wouldn't feel so much like a long, dull slog
4158300	4159820	every time you refight them,
4159820	4162140	getting them slowly back down to that last sliver
4162140	4164540	before they suddenly shoot you dead instantly again.
4164540	4166860	Great, now I have to come back and pick away at his health
4166860	4168860	and hope he doesn't insta-kill me again.
4168860	4170940	Bloodborne? More like blood...
4170940	4172060	snorn.
4172860	4173660	Gah.
4176460	4178620	You can fucking hit me out of my combo
4178620	4180060	while I'm hitting you.
4180060	4182460	That is a fucked up thing to put in a game.
4183500	4184700	That's fucked up, right?
4184700	4186620	Also, they have seemingly infinite ammo,
4186620	4188460	which is just rude.
4188460	4190700	Weirdly enough, invasions by other players
4190700	4193580	show off my version of this mechanic perfectly.
4193580	4196460	I got invaded exactly once in my first playthrough,
4196460	4197900	and it was exhilarating.
4197900	4199900	We both came close to dying multiple times
4199900	4202300	and made spaces to heal as we continued to fight.
4202300	4203580	Healing is super quick,
4203580	4204940	but the developers were smart enough
4204940	4206300	to make this parryable.
4206300	4207820	That's how I won in the end.
4207820	4209580	I kind of wish I'd been invaded more,
4209580	4211340	and that's not really something I say often
4211340	4212620	about the Souls series.
4212620	4214780	Maybe I'm just being a big whiny baby here,
4214780	4216700	or maybe that one invasion was so fun
4216700	4218460	it's forced me to wish there were more fights
4218460	4219660	like that in the game itself,
4219660	4221340	but I think an improvement I'd like to see
4221340	4222940	in a theoretical Bloodborne 2
4222940	4224460	would be more enemies that resemble
4224460	4225660	that kind of encounter.
4225660	4227260	I want the sense that the other hunters
4227260	4229500	got where they did by being exceptionally skilled
4229500	4231180	with the same assets as me,
4231180	4232860	not because they inexplicably had
4232860	4235660	many times more health and infinite ammo.
4235660	4236160	Oh.
4237260	4237740	But because of these dead...
4237740	4238240	Stop it!
4238240	4239260	But because of these dead...
4239260	4241100	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
4241100	4242540	I also think the blood vial system,
4242540	4243580	while good and fun,
4243580	4246060	has the inherent downsides of if you run out,
4246060	4247340	you can't easily buy more
4247340	4249820	because they're just a bit too expensive per vial,
4249820	4251180	and if you're in an area or boss
4251180	4252140	that kills you a lot,
4252140	4254060	you're not going to be recovering them from enemies,
4254060	4256220	so you inevitably have to go farm vials
4256220	4257340	or the souls to buy them,
4257340	4259100	and that's just not great when it happens.
4259100	4261020	There's also some incredibly weird bits
4261020	4262300	where enemies aren't designed
4262300	4263820	for the areas you find them in,
4263820	4264780	like some of the bosses
4264780	4266860	or the giants in Cathedral Ward.
4266860	4268060	I'd like you to tell me
4268060	4269500	what even hit me there,
4270540	4271980	and why do you have to go back
4271980	4273100	to the central hub
4273100	4274540	every time you want to go somewhere?
4274540	4275580	That's kind of annoying.
4275580	4277260	These are all relatively small problems
4277260	4278220	in the grand scheme.
4278220	4279740	My main problem with the game
4279740	4281180	is also the best demonstration
4281180	4283580	of why the rest of Bloodborne is so good.
4283580	4285580	The chalice dungeons.
4285580	4287580	Oh my god!
4287580	4289420	They're a completely optional part of the game
4289420	4290620	where you can go into dungeons
4290620	4291500	and traverse them,
4291500	4293020	fighting more bosses and enemies,
4293020	4294700	and some of them are randomly generated,
4294700	4295980	meaning there is theoretically
4295980	4297500	infinite content in Bloodborne,
4298060	4299500	but I'm going to be honest,
4299500	4301100	they're really bad.
4301100	4302060	By stripping out the part
4302060	4303500	where the levels are carefully designed
4303500	4305180	to be fun and good and interesting
4305180	4307580	and challenge you in a fair and reactive way,
4307580	4310140	the dungeon segments can be teeth-grindingly bad
4310140	4311500	in ways that simply aren't fun.
4312300	4313180	Accidentally,
4313180	4314300	they're object lessons
4314300	4316380	in why we still have level designers
4316380	4317660	and don't just have a computer
4317660	4319100	churn out all our levels.
4319100	4321260	The chalice dungeons are so lazily put together
4321260	4321980	that this guy,
4321980	4323020	who spawns in, like,
4323020	4324140	all of the important rooms
4324140	4325420	in any given dungeon,
4325420	4327580	like, one of the bosses in the dungeons
4327580	4328780	is just three of him.
4329420	4330540	So on some floors,
4330540	4332140	you beat one of these guys,
4332140	4334220	hit the switch that unlocks the boss door,
4334220	4335900	and then you fight three more of him,
4335900	4336400	and you're like,
4337100	4337600	what?
4338140	4339340	You know, I've heard criticisms
4339340	4340780	that some enemies in the Souls series
4340780	4341980	start to get repetitive,
4341980	4343020	but honestly,
4343580	4345500	they don't even come close to this,
4345500	4347500	where you're literally just fighting the same guy
4347500	4349580	over and over in different permutations.
4349580	4350860	I'm not covering the chalice dungeons
4350860	4351900	in very much detail here
4351900	4353900	because I feel like I've talked about Bloodborne
4353900	4354780	enough at this point,
4355420	4357420	so it's not really going to hammer home
4357420	4359100	how just bad this is.
4359100	4359600	Like,
4359660	4361580	this room you're seeing right now,
4361580	4362940	you will see this room copied
4362940	4364220	over and over
4364220	4364940	for hours.
4365500	4367100	That is all the chalice dungeons are.
4367100	4367900	There are,
4367900	4368400	there are, like,
4369020	4371340	five, six different kinds of room
4371340	4372380	repeated
4372380	4373660	over and over.
4373660	4375100	Honestly, watch this part of the video
4375100	4375900	on a loop for, like,
4376700	4377740	two and a half hours,
4377740	4380380	and you will have a full replication
4380380	4382060	of about as much of the chalice dungeon
4382060	4384060	as I can stand to record
4384060	4385100	to make this video.
4385100	4386300	Even the pre-made dungeons
4386300	4387660	are just the same kind of rooms
4387660	4389740	in different configurations over and over.
4389740	4390860	It's not great.
4390860	4391980	You know what it reminded me of?
4392620	4393740	Kingsfield.
4393740	4396460	And no game should be like Kingsfield.
4396460	4397100	Oh, hey, look.
4397100	4398140	It's another one of those.
4398140	4400220	I'm so fucking surprised.
4400220	4401740	They also reveal how good
4401740	4402700	the rest of the game is
4402700	4404700	by showing how much care and attention
4404700	4405740	must have gone into making
4405740	4407100	all the areas and encounters
4407100	4409100	look and feel as good as they do.
4409100	4410380	And they do that by showing
4410380	4411660	how lacking the game would have been
4411660	4412860	if they hadn't been there.
4412860	4414140	Yharnam does the impossible
4414140	4416140	by feeling varied and huge and complex
4416140	4417420	while being primarily focused
4417420	4420300	on one big kind of similar-looking town
4420300	4422380	made of very similar kinds of architecture
4422380	4423100	throughout.
4423100	4424700	The chalice dungeons remind me
4424700	4426060	of the parts of dungeon crawlers
4426060	4427740	that don't hold up to scrutiny either.
4427740	4429740	They're almost literally just box rooms
4429740	4431420	with grimy stone textures
4431420	4432380	thrown up everywhere.
4432380	4434220	If Bloodborne were released as a roguelike
4434220	4436620	that used this randomly generated stuff
4436620	4438380	or if the whole game looked and felt
4438380	4439820	like the chalice dungeons,
4439820	4441180	I think I would hate it.
4441180	4442780	There's this game called Necropolis.
4442780	4444700	It's billed as a Dark Souls roguelike.
4444700	4446220	It's kind of boring.
4446220	4447660	The enemies are repetitive.
4447660	4448940	There's no boss fights.
4448940	4450860	Even quick attacks feel slow
4450860	4452300	like in Lords of the Fallen.
4452300	4453340	And more importantly,
4453340	4454700	the lack of design
4454700	4456460	in any of the levels or environments
4456460	4457740	means there's no character
4457740	4459100	or feel to the world.
4459180	4460300	It's the chalice dungeons
4460300	4461900	but without the upshot of being attached
4461900	4463500	to an actually good game.
4463500	4464620	I guess what I'm saying is
4464620	4465980	I like games when they're...
4466620	4469420	designed by people?
4469420	4470220	Weirdly enough,
4470220	4471420	while some of the new bosses
4471420	4473020	that only appear in the chalice dungeons
4473020	4474620	are repeated a lot across them
4474620	4475980	and clearly didn't have much time
4475980	4476940	or effort put into them
4476940	4478540	and don't strike me as particularly
4478540	4479980	interesting in and of themselves,
4479980	4481420	several of them are super fun
4481420	4483180	to actually fight once you get to them.
4483180	4484140	It's almost a shame
4484140	4485500	that the content you have to pass through
4485500	4487020	to get to them are kind of boring
4487020	4488060	or actively unfun
4488060	4489820	because they're worthy encounters.
4489820	4491340	I almost wonder if all the bosses
4491340	4492060	you encounter here
4492060	4492940	are the ones they made
4492940	4494140	and weren't happy with
4494140	4494940	so they didn't bother
4494940	4496300	putting them in the main game,
4496300	4497260	which naturally means
4497260	4498060	the best ones here
4498060	4499260	are the ones that feel the most
4499260	4501020	like they should have been after all.
4501020	4501740	Look at that!
4501740	4503020	There's a boss from earlier
4503020	4504300	in the regular dungeons
4504300	4505500	just walking around
4505500	4507660	and he's surrounded by two other bosses
4507660	4509260	from earlier in this dungeon
4509260	4511180	and they—they kill him for me!
4512220	4512860	What?!
4512860	4513740	The chalice dungeons
4513740	4515100	make a lot of points for me
4515100	4516860	about the importance of level design
4516860	4518300	and execution in these games
4518300	4519980	and show how the base mechanics alone
4519980	4520860	wouldn't be enough
4520860	4523020	for an engaging and fun experience.
4523020	4524220	You need the push and pull
4524220	4525900	of a designer hiding enemies
4525900	4527420	in just the right places,
4527420	4529260	scaling the difficulty of encounters
4529260	4530380	through careful development
4530380	4531740	of enemy placement and so on.
4533900	4535420	Oh, I fucking see you, mate.
4535420	4535980	Yeah, I've played—
4535980	4537260	I've played a video game before.
4537900	4539020	You're not weird, are you?
4539020	4539740	Welcome—
4539740	4541740	Welcome to Dark Souls!
4541740	4542860	That's the first trick
4542860	4543980	they pull in all those games.
4543980	4544780	Yep.
4544780	4546300	You got me the first time through.
4546300	4547980	This is a true Souls game.
4548620	4549340	Don't even bother
4549340	4550220	looking at what I picked up.
4551260	4552540	The real victory was—
4552540	4553260	Oh, Jesus!
4556460	4558540	I was feeling so full of myself then
4558540	4559980	and, like, another guy came.
4560780	4561420	Holy shit.
4562380	4563260	This game's amazing.
4563980	4565820	If you like walking from box room
4565820	4567340	to box room full
4567340	4569180	just of a bunch of random enemies
4569180	4569900	plopped in there
4569900	4572300	and, oh, look, it's another one of those,
4573020	4574700	then I guess
4574700	4576140	the chalice dungeons are for you.
4576700	4578060	If you like the chalice dungeons
4578060	4579020	and the randomness,
4579020	4580700	I can see an appeal to that,
4580700	4582300	but let's admit that
4582300	4583980	the actual game is more fun
4584940	4586060	and if that, for you,
4586060	4587020	is a contentious point,
4588140	4589900	then I'm sorry,
4589900	4592620	but you are beneath me.
4596780	4597980	Here's the part where I wrap up
4597980	4599260	and give some pithy comments
4599260	4600620	about how developers have things
4600620	4602460	to learn from Bloodborne,
4602460	4603980	but do they?
4603980	4605580	Not every game has to learn something
4605580	4606380	from Bloodborne.
4606380	4607660	Not every game is attempting
4607660	4609340	such a sharp, crackling,
4609340	4610300	deliberateness,
4610300	4611580	such a test of perception
4611580	4613500	and prediction over raw mechanical input
4613500	4615100	or simpler sorts of puzzle
4615100	4617340	or such a specific sense of uncertainty
4617340	4618620	and esoteric horror.
4618620	4620540	While many designers might well recognize
4620540	4621500	in Bloodborne a method
4621500	4622300	they could get across
4622300	4624140	their own intended reaction better,
4624140	4625180	a way of helping players
4625180	4626380	to get the best experience
4626380	4627020	from their work
4627020	4628220	by altering the attitude
4628220	4629500	with which they perceive it,
4629500	4631420	an equal, if not larger amount,
4631420	4632620	should strive to learn
4632620	4633820	absolutely nothing.
4633820	4634700	Gamers everywhere
4634700	4636540	have already had years of laughing
4636540	4637740	and attempts to commodify
4637740	4639580	their enjoyment of the Souls series.
4639580	4641500	The endless descriptions of new games
4641500	4641900	with,
4641900	4642940	it's like Dark Souls,
4642940	4643980	but with Y.
4643980	4644940	The sad truth is,
4644940	4645980	the most common reason
4645980	4647500	the Souls games didn't have Y
4647500	4648300	is because they would have been
4648300	4649260	the worst for it.
4649260	4650940	You know, I thought I wanted a roguelike
4650940	4652380	that was a bit like Dark Souls,
4652380	4653740	but then when I actually got it,
4653740	4655180	I realized there was a reason
4655180	4656700	why they didn't make one of those
4656700	4657820	in the first place.
4657820	4659820	More importantly is the wider critical
4659820	4661420	and cultural overreaction
4661420	4663260	to the series and its popularity.
4663260	4663980	While lots of folks
4663980	4665260	have always been super positive
4665260	4665980	about the series,
4665980	4667420	even since Demon's Souls,
4667420	4668620	its spiritual successor
4668620	4670060	becoming a genuine smash hit
4670060	4671660	with a huge swath of players
4671660	4673020	has caused lots of games writers
4673020	4674460	to kind of go into overdrive
4674460	4675500	about the series.
4675500	4677100	I can already predict one comment
4677100	4678140	someone paused this video
4678140	4679340	halfway through to leave.
4679340	4680540	Why did you bring up Thumper
4680540	4681660	right in the middle of this?
4681660	4683020	Thumper's a rhythm game.
4683020	4683740	What does it have to do
4683740	4685740	with bloody action, adventure,
4685740	4687900	RPG things like the Souls games?
4687900	4689340	Well, apart from the general point
4689340	4690300	I made about how games
4690300	4691340	can engross you,
4691340	4691900	you're right.
4691900	4693100	It doesn't really have much in common
4693100	4694380	with the Souls series.
4694380	4695500	The main reason I brought it up
4695500	4696620	was because when I was reading
4696620	4697420	reviews of Thumper
4697420	4699100	to see what people thought about it,
4699100	4700300	I found a review that called it
4700300	4702460	the Dark Souls of Rhythm Games.
4702460	4703900	I could say that calling something
4703900	4705260	the Dark Souls of something
4705260	4707020	or saying something is like Dark Souls
4707020	4708220	for the sake of comparison
4708220	4709020	and easy clicks
4709020	4710860	is just poor and cliche writing,
4710860	4711900	and it kind of is,
4711900	4713340	but it's more that we as critics
4713340	4714860	have a duty to communicate
4714860	4716380	why something is good.
4716380	4717660	Thumper has done a disservice
4717660	4718540	by being described
4718540	4720460	as the Dark Souls of Rhythm Games
4720460	4721980	because it indicates that we still
4721980	4723340	don't have the language
4723340	4724300	to really explain
4724300	4725660	why something is good
4725660	4726780	without having to compare it
4726780	4728140	to a singular experience
4728140	4730060	that isn't really all that much like it
4730060	4731820	when you really get down to it.
4731820	4733820	I remember Yahtzee's Dark Souls review.
4733820	4735340	In it, he makes this point.
4735340	4736460	So I'd ask them to explain
4736460	4736940	why it's good,
4736940	4737580	and they'd reply,
4737580	4738540	ooh, we can't tell you.
4738540	4739820	You just have to find out for yourself.
4739820	4740700	And then I'd say,
4740700	4741980	shut up or fuck off,
4741980	4743500	ideally both in either order.
4743500	4745020	He kind of skips over it for a joke,
4745020	4745820	but what he's doing here
4745820	4747500	is actually describing the problem.
4747500	4748460	We as a community
4748460	4749260	are sometimes unable
4749260	4750220	to really come up with
4750220	4751740	why we think something is good
4751740	4752700	or we enjoy it,
4752700	4754780	and it leaves us having to vaguely
4754780	4756140	gesture in a game's direction
4756140	4757900	because words have failed us.
4757900	4759340	It's a hard series to pin down,
4759340	4760380	I know, trust me.
4760380	4761980	I've just spent a really long time
4761980	4763020	trying to do so
4763020	4764060	because when we grapple
4764060	4765980	with why we enjoy something,
4765980	4767260	we're ultimately interrogating
4767260	4768220	our own feelings,
4768220	4769500	and that's a very difficult thing
4769500	4770460	to do indeed.
4770460	4771500	At least I assume that's why
4771500	4773260	my therapist charges so much.
4773260	4775900	But good criticism means good discourse.
4775900	4777900	I can completely see why writers,
4777900	4779020	critics, and journalists
4779020	4780540	use the shorthands they do,
4780540	4782140	but I think the onus is on us
4782140	4783340	to try not to,
4783340	4784940	to be willing to be long,
4784940	4785820	complicated,
4785820	4786940	willing to be, yeah,
4786940	4787980	even a little bit boring
4787980	4789180	or pedantic at times
4789180	4789980	in order to explore
4789980	4791820	the qualities of gaming experiences
4791820	4793180	in a truly valuable way,
4793180	4794060	which I hope I've done,
4794060	4795660	but knowing me, I probably, uh...
4796540	4797100	didn't.
4797100	4798460	For things to fully get judged
4798460	4799500	on their own merit,
4799500	4800860	we have to start examining
4800860	4802300	the actual merits
4802300	4803980	in concrete terms.
4803980	4804460	For the record,
4804460	4806140	the most accurate comparison I've seen
4806140	4807580	is when Patrick Klepek described
4807580	4808940	beating a Mario Maker level
4808940	4809980	as like the feeling of
4809980	4811340	beating a Dark Souls boss.
4811340	4813500	The point is the level achieved a feeling
4813500	4814620	rather than having any
4814620	4816060	pure mechanical similarity.
4816060	4817740	I mean, they're completely different genres.
4817740	4819580	It's hard to do that comparison right,
4819580	4821100	but Scoops managed it.
4821100	4821660	Hmm.
4821660	4822700	A hard thing to do
4822700	4824540	that only a few people achieve?
4824540	4826220	I guess that makes Patrick Klepek
4826220	4828140	the Dark Souls of Game Critic.
4828700	4829500	Bloodborne,
4829500	4831100	a game about injecting yourself
4831100	4832140	with increasing amounts
4832140	4833820	of dangerous liquid,
4833820	4836460	is itself the ultimate gateway drug.
4836460	4837980	The precise beauty
4837980	4839820	of the particulars of the experience
4839820	4841340	make for a fantastic thing
4841340	4842300	all on its own.
4842300	4844540	But perhaps more importantly
4844540	4845980	than being one of the best games
4845980	4847180	of its generation,
4847180	4848540	it inoculates its players
4848540	4849580	against the problems
4849580	4851020	the Souls series has previously
4851020	4853340	been unable to rid itself for years.
4853340	4855260	The previous games were really good,
4855260	4856220	but their design
4856220	4857740	accidentally necessitated
4857740	4858620	ways of playing it
4858620	4859740	that were conservative
4859740	4861260	and just not all that fun
4861260	4862540	to actually do.
4862540	4864300	It was, to coin yet another
4864300	4865900	unfitting food metaphor,
4865900	4867580	being handed a very good
4867580	4868460	bowl of soup,
4868460	4869420	shout-out to soup,
4869420	4871660	but being given a shield-shaped
4871660	4873180	pitchfork to eat it with.
4873180	4874540	It took a lot of time to realize
4874540	4875660	there were more funner ways
4875660	4877420	of doing it than it presented itself,
4877420	4877980	and by then,
4877980	4879740	people had lost their appetite.
4879740	4881580	Bloodborne is better soup,
4881580	4882620	but more importantly,
4882620	4883740	it's soup that comes with
4883740	4885180	a piece of paper that says,
4885180	4886700	hey, don't use the shield.
4886700	4888620	Just find a spoon or some bread
4888620	4889820	or just pour me directly
4889820	4890540	into your mouth.
4891180	4892540	Also, the bowl somehow
4892540	4894380	also contains a theoretical
4894380	4896540	infinite amount of bad soup
4896540	4897580	that tastes awful,
4897580	4898540	but it's cordoned off
4898540	4899820	from the good parts of the soup
4899820	4901980	and completely optional to consume.
4901980	4902940	Okay, I probably should have
4902940	4904060	written a conclusion out.
4904060	4905420	This isn't doing very good.
4905420	4907340	What ways do I expect the series
4907340	4909020	to be improved on in the future?
4909020	4910540	Well, I'm honestly daunted
4910540	4911340	by the genius
4911340	4912780	of the FromSoftware team,
4912780	4914540	so I really can't wait
4914540	4915900	to be surprised
4915900	4917020	by how they improve on it
4917020	4917900	in the future.
4917900	4918940	At the very least, though,
4918940	4920380	I do hope that Bloodborne 2
4920380	4922220	comes with complimentary breadsticks.
4923820	4925180	I can't end the video like that.
4925180	4925680	I can't.
4925680	4926180	I can't.
4933280	4935280	I'd like to say a very special thanks to...

5065600	5069040	While the rest of the credits going past, uh, in case you want to know,
5069040	5071600	yes, I am planning a Fallout 4 video,
5071600	5075600	but it's taking some time because I want to approach it with enough critical distance that
5075600	5078640	I give it a proper shot, you know? I want to take my time with it.
5078640	5083200	So I want to make at least one more long video in this style about something else first.
5083920	5088000	If you think about it, it took me eight years to make the Fallout 3 video,
5088000	5091520	and as of November 10th, Fallout 4 has only been out for one.
5091520	5092880	So give me a little bit, you know?
5093680	5097440	The best part about this video being over is I still haven't played Dark Souls 3
5097440	5104400	or the DLC for Bloodborne because I've been too busy making this video since, like, July?
5105520	5109920	This video was supposed to originally come out in October as, like, a Halloween special,
5109920	5112080	but I missed that.
5112080	5115440	So, like, I can finally play video games again.
5119040	5121360	People who back me get access to bonus videos,
5121360	5125440	and also I recorded, like, 24 hours of footage of me playing Bloodborne
5125440	5126960	with a friend that I'm going to put out there.
5127760	5128720	So there's that.
5128720	5134320	But also I shot a pretty elaborate sketch for this video that I decided to take out
5134320	5136640	because I realized it was just complete nonsense.
5136640	5139120	So that stuff's going to be going up soon.
5139120	5141040	I really want to put out a bunch of bonus videos.
5141040	5145600	I've been kind of putting off working on them to get this video out at all ever.
5145600	5147600	So I feel really bad about that.
5147600	5150720	So I'm going to put a whole bunch of those things out as soon as I can.
5150720	5152000	So bear with me.
5157440	5166480	Wow, you sat through all of those?
5167040	5168560	That's very nice of you.
5168560	5171360	If you backed me, I certainly hope I managed to get your name in there.
5171360	5174400	I always worry if I somehow miss names,
5174400	5176480	even though I literally just copy and paste it from a list.
5176480	5178160	If I've made a huge mistake, let me know.
5178160	5181120	But as a present for the nice folks who bothered to sit through the credits
5181120	5183920	of all the people who allowed me to keep making this stuff,
5183920	5186480	I'd like to just throw some game names out there.
5187360	5188400	Shadow of Mordor,
5188960	5191040	Deus Ex Human Revolution,
5191680	5194160	Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines.
5194160	5197440	Feel free to write one of those names in a comment on this video
5197440	5199360	and see what it causes to happen.
