00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
You already know who Sherlock Holmes is.

00:02.300 --> 00:05.240
He's one of the most famous characters in all of Western canon.

00:05.240 --> 00:11.160
He was in dozens and dozens and dozens of stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from 1891 to 1927.

00:11.160 --> 00:16.760
He's a pop-culturally important icon and a foundational figure in the crime and mystery genres of fiction

00:16.760 --> 00:19.080
that have continued all the way to the present day.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.200
The character has been adapted and reimagined and referenced more than any other fictional character,

00:24.200 --> 00:26.040
except, of course, for Jesus Christ.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.360
["Aaaaaaahhh!" sound effect plays in the background.]

00:27.360 --> 00:32.840
The character's so instantly recognizable that, if you strap a hat and coat and pipe onto a teddy bear

00:32.840 --> 00:34.720
and put it in the window of your shop,

00:34.720 --> 00:39.360
people will come in asking how many thousands of pounds they can give you for the Sherlock bear.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.200
["Three. Three thousands of pounds."

00:43.200 --> 00:44.800
["Oh, here it is." sound effect plays in the background.]

00:44.800 --> 00:50.560
There's many direct film adaptations, including, uh, two fun romps made by Guy Ritchie, of all people.

00:50.560 --> 00:56.120
There's a bunch of old film serials, and there's a whole bunch of famous actors who've had a turn playing him.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.440
There's multiple different television versions,

00:58.440 --> 01:02.880
an animated series set in the 22nd century where he got frozen for hundreds of years

01:02.880 --> 01:05.640
and also Watson is a robot for some reason,

01:05.640 --> 01:11.440
and a Canadian children's TV series starring Sherlock's great-grandniece Shirley Holmes.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.680
["Those last two are canon. I can prove it!" sound effect plays in the background.]

01:14.680 --> 01:18.960
And there's perhaps an uncountable amount of books, shows, films, and other properties

01:18.960 --> 01:23.000
directly inspired by or based on the stories and characters,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.160
one of the most obvious and best in recent history being House MD,

01:26.160 --> 01:31.440
a show I've seen all the way through multiple times, starring huge Laurie as Dr. House

01:31.440 --> 01:34.920
and Robert Sean Leonard as Dr. James... Wilson.

01:34.920 --> 01:35.480
You get it?

01:35.480 --> 01:39.280
And my goodness, we haven't even talked about the anime adaptations ye-

01:39.280 --> 01:40.280
Let's not do that.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.440
Then there are the two recent and still active television adaptations.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.080
Elementary plays out like a police procedural in tone,

01:47.080 --> 01:51.520
which is fitting because that type of story is arguably a natural descendant of the original genre,

01:51.520 --> 01:56.760
and it's set in the U.S., this time with Dr. Joan Watson, played by Lucy Liu, and it's pretty good.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.680
It's not as good as House, but it's a well-put-together show and it's very... comfy.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.320
["Sigh." sound effect plays in the background.]

02:01.320 --> 02:03.240
And then there's Sherlock.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.600
Sherlock is an overproduced, overwritten, over-pissed pile of garbage

02:08.600 --> 02:12.760
and the greatest reason ever made to dodge paying your TV license.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.600
But what's so wrong about it? And why do so many people like it?

02:16.600 --> 02:20.280
Or rather, why did so many people think they liked it until season four came out

02:20.280 --> 02:23.160
and everyone collectively realized it was bad and always had been?

02:23.160 --> 02:25.160
And why did that happen?

02:25.160 --> 02:29.560
All these questions and more are going to be answered over the course of this primal, hallucinatory nightmare-

02:29.560 --> 02:30.920
I mean, video essay.

02:30.920 --> 02:34.520
And I hope I can properly impart why this show is such a horrible travesty.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.120
And just to make it clear in advance,

02:36.120 --> 02:41.880
I'm going to do it without ever getting Benedict Cumberbatch's name wrong on purpose for a lazy, overused joke.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.080
Not even once.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.680
Okay, I'm gonna do it once.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.840
Benedict Cumberbad.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.360
Okay, now it's out of my system.

♪ ONAGIRU NARA KONO SORA WO DAITE KAGAYAKU SHOUNEN YO SHINWA NI NARE! ♪

03:08.200 --> 03:10.840
This isn't just the story of one bad show.

03:10.840 --> 03:16.200
Really, it's the story of the life and times of its lead writer, Stephen William Moffat.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.480
Moffat got spat out of a hole in the ground in Paisley in 1961

03:19.480 --> 03:23.880
with the straightforward mission of systematically destroying all of English pop culture,

03:23.880 --> 03:25.800
and no one stopped him yet.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.000
Okay, that's not fair.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.880
Moffat is himself a staple of modern English pop culture,

03:29.880 --> 03:33.320
having written or been involved with a couple of really good shows in his life,

03:33.320 --> 03:39.160
including Coupling, one of the more experimental, creative, and genuinely funny romantic sitcoms ever made.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.240
It's loosely based on how he met his wife, who, by the way, produced the show,

03:43.240 --> 03:45.320
which is probably why he had so much creative freedom.

03:45.320 --> 03:50.120
Although it does raise some questions about how insular the higher-level production staff at the BBC have become.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.560
I'm sure that won't come up later.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.480
After that, during the reboot of Doctor Who,

03:53.480 --> 03:57.400
perhaps the only other British pop cultural staple as iconic as Sherlock Holmes,

03:57.400 --> 04:01.720
Moffat came on and wrote numerous really good episodes that are loved by the fanbase,

04:01.720 --> 04:06.600
giving him massive critical acclaim and winning him, among other things, a Hugo Award and a BAFTA.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.520
If you don't know what those awards are or what they mean, it's okay. No one does.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.520
He's been a fan of Doctor Who all his life,

04:12.520 --> 04:16.360
and in 1999, he even wrote the Doctor Who parody episode,

04:16.360 --> 04:17.880
The Curse of Fatal Death.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.120
Why'd you have chairs on a Dalek spaceship anyway?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.480
Wait, we'll explain later.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.000
This special is one of the best contributions to the series ever,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.520
and somehow still more progressive than the real Doctor Who ever managed to be.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.160
It ends with the Doctor regenerating into a woman.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.040
Scandalous.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.040
Now there's a guy who should be running Doctor Who, the fanbase collectively said aloud.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.200
His writing is scary, dramatic.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.680
He has genuine, established comedic chops, both within and without the science fiction genre.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.840
He might even, you know, make there be a Doctor...

04:51.880 --> 04:52.680
...not played by a man.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.840
You know, maybe.

04:54.840 --> 05:00.600
And in a television miracle, the likes of which hasn't been seen before or since in science fiction,

05:00.600 --> 05:05.080
when Rusty Davies stood down as showrunner, the fans got what they wanted.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.920
["MARFAT'S THEME"]

05:08.920 --> 05:09.720
Oops.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.960
Some of the good aspects of Marfat's writing remain,

05:11.960 --> 05:15.880
but overall, the show is somewhat lacking something with him in the driver's seat.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.880
There's a lot of problems, but the main one,

05:17.880 --> 05:21.960
alongside him not doing the one thing it would have been really cool for him to do

05:21.960 --> 05:25.880
the two times and soon-to-be-three the Doctor has regenerated under his watch,

05:25.880 --> 05:29.320
is that the show is now totally dedicated to the persona of the Doctor.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.400
Previously, the Doctor was the main character, yes,

05:31.400 --> 05:33.800
and he was very important in the story of the canon.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.880
He'd been around for a long time, and he knows the history of the universe almost offhand.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.440
He's dabbled in events so often that writers have played this both for drama and for comedy.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.360
["MARFAT'S THEME"]

05:44.360 --> 05:47.880
["SONIC BLASTER, 51ST CENTURY, WEAPON FACTORIES OF VILLENGAARD"]

05:47.880 --> 05:49.000
["YOU'VE BEEN TO THE FACTORIES?"]

05:49.000 --> 05:49.480
["ONCE"]

05:49.480 --> 05:53.240
["WELL, THEY'RE GONE NOW, DESTROYED, MAIN REACTOR WENT CRITICAL, VAPORIZED THE LIGHT"]

05:53.240 --> 05:55.080
["LIKE I SAID, ONCE"]

05:55.080 --> 05:57.320
That once from the first episode Marfat did, by the way.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.520
But ultimately, he was just a guy with his own personality and problems

06:00.520 --> 06:05.240
who liked having adventures and was a single piece of the puzzle of every episode's story.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.640
Marfat's version of the show positions the Doctor as the central puzzle piece to complete the universe,

06:09.640 --> 06:12.760
with an army of secret societies out to personally destroy the Doctor

06:12.760 --> 06:16.680
because he's the most important person of all time, and special, and wow.

06:16.680 --> 06:23.880
["He is the Doctor. He has walked to this universe for centuries untold. He has seen stars fall to dust."

06:23.880 --> 06:27.880
The first episode written by Marfat with himself as showrunner ends with the Doctor winning

06:27.880 --> 06:31.560
by telling the villains how cool and important and special he is,

06:31.560 --> 06:33.480
and this speech scares them off.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.800
It's all about the Doctor, instead of the stories the Doctor interacts with.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.880
The lesson here is that Marfat is a decent writer, capable of being a great one at times,

06:41.880 --> 06:45.000
but a terrible showrunner because he believes his own hype.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.200
He's very good at implying there's something smart or deep happening

06:48.200 --> 06:52.280
and throwing nice tidbits about the Doctor's history into the mix, like the thing about the gun factory,

06:52.280 --> 06:55.720
but he's not very good at actually doing these things that are referred to.

06:55.720 --> 07:01.960
And a story that consists entirely of a man running around implying he used to do cool shit is a bad story.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.000
Marfat simply doesn't write in the way that's required to pace and execute a full series of television,

07:07.000 --> 07:13.320
which leads us to the problem of him getting to do that with Sherlock.

07:13.320 --> 07:19.000
["Sherlock Holmes Theme"]

07:19.000 --> 07:22.360
What made the original stories so popular was the fact they were self-contained.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.200
Apart from a few scant references to other events or the year the story takes place,

07:26.200 --> 07:29.720
nothing connects the Sherlock Holmes stories to each other as a singular narrative.

07:29.720 --> 07:34.200
On top of that, Holmes and Watson don't change all that much as people over the course of all those stories.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.680
This was hugely beneficial to the impact of the work,

07:36.680 --> 07:39.160
because it meant that even though there were tons of stories,

07:39.160 --> 07:43.800
a person could get a complete narrative without the idea that they were missing too much if they read one of them.

07:43.800 --> 07:49.000
It also meant that since there wasn't a larger overarching plot that needed to be served by each individual story,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.760
they all had their own room to breathe.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.160
If all the dozens of stories had tied into each other,

07:53.160 --> 07:54.760
people would have got confused and bored,

07:54.760 --> 07:59.560
and it wouldn't have been as punchy as getting a series of short, complete stories that were all satisfying on their own.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.800
This format survives in many adaptations.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.720
The 40s serials, for example, don't tie into each other at all, even though there's 14 of them.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.760
You can watch Sherlock Holmes and the Pearl of Death, a personal favorite,

08:08.760 --> 08:12.200
and never need to see any of the others to know what's going on or feel satisfied.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.960
And even in elementary or house, while there's narratives that run throughout the series,

08:15.960 --> 08:20.040
most episodes deal with their own particular one-off mystery and don't have to be all interlinked,

08:20.040 --> 08:23.880
so even tuning into a random episode, you feel like you've got a complete story.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.880
I think it's fair to say the episodic nature of Sherlock Holmes is key to its appeal

08:27.880 --> 08:30.120
and should remain in any adaptation.

08:30.120 --> 08:35.080
Sherlock takes the core concept of the storytelling of Sherlock Holmes and why it works,

08:35.080 --> 08:38.680
crumples it up, hides it in one of six busts of Napoleon,

08:38.680 --> 08:41.480
and then uses them as clubs to kill baby seals.

08:41.480 --> 08:46.040
It opens on Watson's experiences scarring him and the murders that set up that episode's killer.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.200
See, it opens on Watson because historically,

08:48.200 --> 08:51.480
Watson is the point of view from which the audience experiences Holmes.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.640
Watson is the one we actually relate to.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.440
We must first understand Watson to understand Holmes.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.400
Remember that because this is the last time it ever happens on Sherlock.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.600
Then Watson meets Holmes.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.680
He comes with him on a case and they begin to bond,

09:02.680 --> 09:08.040
and almost the entire episode is focused on actually solving the crime.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.720
You know, the fun mystery story?

09:11.720 --> 09:13.960
Well, sort of.

09:13.960 --> 09:18.360
About 30 minutes in, Watson is taken out of the story to meet Sherlock's brother Mycroft,

09:18.360 --> 09:21.800
played by Mark Gatiss, one of the other two writers of the show from Moffat.

09:21.800 --> 09:26.360
They take time, attention, and focus away from the plot of the episode at hand

09:26.520 --> 09:30.600
just to let you know as early as possible that Sherlock has a brother who's around,

09:30.600 --> 09:31.960
and he does stuff.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.080
He keeps popping up just to sort of let you know he exists,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
and he's keeping tabs on what's going on.

09:37.080 --> 09:42.120
But apart from that, almost a full hour is dedicated to trying to solve the crime.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.040
The first two episodes are probably the closest the show ever gets to being good

09:46.040 --> 09:47.640
because you get a lot of long stretches

09:47.640 --> 09:51.160
where the characters try to use deductive reasoning to solve a mystery.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.720
It's still bullshit, for reasons we'll get into later,

09:53.720 --> 09:56.040
but it's the least bullshit we're gonna get,

09:56.040 --> 09:58.760
and that makes it worthy of a fucking prize.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.040
But then this happens.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.800
The killer, the cab driver, shows up at Sherlock's place for unknown reasons,

10:03.800 --> 10:07.000
and then he just sort of gets into the cab.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.040
Then he takes him to an abandoned building and they play mind games

10:10.040 --> 10:11.960
while he explains that he knows about Sherlock

10:11.960 --> 10:14.360
because Moriarty pays him whenever he kills someone

10:14.360 --> 10:19.080
and also told him about Sherlock because Moriarty knows about Sherlock and is a fan of his.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.520
How did you find me?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.880
I was warned about you.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.320
Who warned you about me?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.080
Someone out there who's noticed.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.520
Who would notice me?

10:26.520 --> 10:27.720
Got yourself a fan.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.000
How did you find me?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.040
How did you find me?

10:34.440 --> 10:35.720
I want a name.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.120
MORIARTY!

10:38.120 --> 10:40.040
Wait, what?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.520
This—I'm tapping my table—

10:42.520 --> 10:45.000
THIS is where the problems begin.

10:45.000 --> 10:45.960
Right here.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.160
Everything in the entire universe of the show exists

10:49.160 --> 10:52.920
to set up the inevitable confrontation between Sherlock and Moriarty,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.280
who already knows about Sherlock and is playing games with him for fun from day one.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.440
It wasn't enough to have a one-off murder mystery

11:00.440 --> 11:03.960
where Sherlock figures out who the killer is and set a good tone

11:03.960 --> 11:07.640
and then maybe have him come up in the future to deal with.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.200
The same thing happens again with the second episode.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.880
It starts out on the right foot with the opening setting up the characters for that episode,

11:13.880 --> 11:18.520
but then at the end, we get this scene where it turns out the villain also works for Moriarty

11:18.520 --> 11:20.120
and he has her killed.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.360
Once again, this is completely unnecessary.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.200
Not everyone bad in the world has to turn out to be working for Moriarty.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.960
This to me relates two things.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.640
One, lack of understanding of what makes the source material work,

11:31.640 --> 11:34.680
and two, the creators' lack of faith in their own material.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.040
The creators have taken a series of stories made famous in the first place

11:38.040 --> 11:40.840
by the fundamental facts you can read them in any order

11:40.840 --> 11:43.080
and made it into a continuous slog,

11:43.080 --> 11:47.080
depicting a pitched grand battle in which most of the playing pieces you see

11:47.080 --> 11:50.120
don't actually have any influence on this wider thing.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.480
None of these people matter.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.600
This guy doesn't matter.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.320
It's all about Sherlock and Moriarty fucking with each other.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.520
Sometimes in the books, Sherlock just helped a couple of people out of a jam,

11:58.520 --> 11:59.560
and that was enough.

11:59.560 --> 12:04.680
Adding in this big, important, grand plan undermines the investment in the actual stories.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.480
A scandal in Bohemia wasn't going to be made any better

12:07.480 --> 12:10.840
by being part of some long-running intellectual magic mind battle

12:10.840 --> 12:12.680
between Sherlock and a gay supervillain.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.680
So Arthur Conan Doyle didn't bother

12:16.680 --> 12:20.200
and instead focused on telling one of the most popular and compelling mystery stories

12:20.200 --> 12:22.520
in the entire Western fucking canon.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.560
Moffat, however, seemed to have other plans.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.040
The worst part is that at some point, Moffat understood this.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.840
The unaired pilot of Sherlock is a version of the first episode

12:30.840 --> 12:32.680
where Mycroft isn't shoehorned in

12:32.680 --> 12:35.160
and the villain doesn't turn out to be funded and informed

12:35.160 --> 12:37.560
by a Moriarty who already knows about Sherlock.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.720
The resulting story is much stronger

12:39.720 --> 12:41.800
because you get the entire episode dedicated

12:41.800 --> 12:45.000
to setting up Sherlock and Watson's dynamic far better than you can

12:45.000 --> 12:46.680
when you're too busy with everything else

12:46.680 --> 12:48.040
and the actual crime they're solving

12:48.040 --> 12:50.440
isn't undercut by already being all about Moriarty

12:50.440 --> 12:51.720
and whatever the hell he's up to.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.640
It gives the motivations and intentions of the episode's villain more of a weight.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.520
In the pilot, Sherlock fucking around trying to be clever

12:58.520 --> 13:00.520
gets him captured by the cab driver

13:00.520 --> 13:02.920
who figures out that he's been found out and drugs him.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.360
You even get a cool exchange setting up Sherlock's previous drug problems.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.440
You do a lot of drugs, Sherlock Holmes?

13:09.160 --> 13:09.960
Not in a while.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.560
I ask because you're very resilient.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.520
Most people would have passed out by now.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.560
This is far better at setting up Sherlock's drug stuff

13:17.640 --> 13:20.280
than having the cops be at his place looking for drugs

13:20.280 --> 13:21.880
and mentioning he used to have a problem

13:22.680 --> 13:25.960
and then he walks out and gets into the cab?

13:25.960 --> 13:31.160
It's like a fucking Mad Libs Chinese telephone version of the plot of the pilot.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.280
It's so dumb.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.160
A thing to keep in mind about the pilot is that it's only an hour long.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.800
I have this theory that almost any story could be improved

13:37.800 --> 13:40.280
if, once the creator came to you and said they thought it was done,

13:40.280 --> 13:43.080
you forced them to take out maybe 10, 15 percent.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.880
It forces them to reassess the importance of what's on the screen

13:45.880 --> 13:48.440
and remove indulgences that don't really add anything.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.240
For example, uh, this section in the script

13:51.240 --> 13:54.360
begins with, like, a 10-minute ramble about the importance of the original stories

13:54.360 --> 13:56.920
but then I decided to rewrite that bit to be a tenth of the length

13:56.920 --> 13:58.360
and that turned out to be way better.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.640
The pilot seems to demonstrate this happening in reverse

14:01.640 --> 14:04.760
where the full show was given an extra half an hour.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.200
So they thought, oh, great!

14:06.200 --> 14:09.400
That gives us time to insert the co-writer of the show's character early

14:09.400 --> 14:11.080
and have intrigue that doesn't go anywhere

14:11.080 --> 14:14.280
because he turns out to be, like, just a normal guy who's worried about his brother

14:14.280 --> 14:17.880
and also connect a nice and simple first story to Moriarty for no reason!

14:17.880 --> 14:21.080
I'll here restate my previous point that Moffat is a decent writer

14:21.080 --> 14:23.480
who would be best utilized in one-off episodes

14:23.480 --> 14:25.720
with strong direction and oversight by others

14:25.720 --> 14:28.520
and not directly in charge of running an entire show

14:28.520 --> 14:31.160
based on one of the most well-known properties in British history

14:31.160 --> 14:33.080
like in Doctor Who or in Sh—

14:33.080 --> 14:33.800
Jekyll!

14:33.800 --> 14:36.280
Oh, you thought I'd forgotten about Jekyll, didn't you, Steve?

14:37.240 --> 14:39.240
Well, I can't blame you.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.520
Most people have.

14:40.520 --> 14:45.800
Jekyll is an adaptation of slash sequel thing to The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

14:45.800 --> 14:48.360
made in 2007 with Moffat writing all of it

14:48.360 --> 14:52.680
and executive produced by Moffat, Catherine Mitchell, and Moffat's mother-in-law.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.880
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is behind Doctor Who and Sherlock Holmes,

14:55.880 --> 14:59.640
maybe the one other really big English pop-cultural character we have.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.520
Can we...

15:00.520 --> 15:02.520
Can we stop giving these to him, please?

15:02.520 --> 15:05.160
It's six episodes and it's quite bad.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.520
It's very bad in some places and surprisingly okay in others

15:08.520 --> 15:11.960
but it exhibits all the same problems as Moffat's work on Doctor Who and Sherlock

15:11.960 --> 15:15.640
so it's worth bringing up as an example of the wider problems with Moffat's writing.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.160
The most noticeable and informative thing about the show is its pacing.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.200
The show opens very strongly with Dr. Jackman,

15:22.200 --> 15:22.760
uh,

15:22.760 --> 15:27.000
aware that he has a condition where he manifests a very strong and dangerous personality

15:27.000 --> 15:28.200
and working to manage it.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.360
We open in media res with someone else being introduced to his techniques.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.640
When I first saw the show, I couldn't be happier that Moffat didn't write

15:35.640 --> 15:39.640
the three previous episodes worth of plot he could have written leading into this room

15:39.640 --> 15:42.360
showing Jackman getting his condition and becoming aware of it

15:42.360 --> 15:44.360
and working to try and find a way around it.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.680
Finding out exactly how the transformation works

15:46.680 --> 15:51.160
and the state of his life and the people in it over the course of the first episode is mostly great,

15:51.160 --> 15:54.040
excluding the bad writing and editing in some places,

15:54.040 --> 15:57.480
but it ends super strong with the viewer interested in what's going to happen next

15:57.480 --> 16:00.920
with Hyde learning that Jackman has a family he's been keeping secret from him

16:00.920 --> 16:03.080
and Jackman getting pretty pissed about that.

16:03.080 --> 16:07.720
Come to my family again, and you and I are at war.

16:07.720 --> 16:12.440
It's a good pilot, and it sells you on the story and the conceit of the transformation very well.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.360
The first episode's clever in places, like with Hyde initially not having a name

16:16.360 --> 16:21.320
and deciding to call himself Billy after kicking a guy's ass and deciding to literally take his name.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.080
Then it gets more intriguing with him meeting someone who addresses him as Mr. Hyde

16:25.080 --> 16:28.360
and referring openly to the actual story the show's based on.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.400
It's a clever twist.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.600
You start out thinking the show's a modern reimagining of the story,

16:32.600 --> 16:35.400
but then it turns out, no, the original book still exists.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.040
It's genuinely entertaining watching the cogs turn and the narrative do unexpected things like that.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.560
But after the first episode, the show immediately begins to fall apart.

16:43.560 --> 16:48.040
It turns out that the Jekyll in the original stories was a real person who also existed

16:48.040 --> 16:52.520
and had the same condition as Jackman, and also they exactly resemble each other.

16:52.520 --> 16:58.200
There's also a secret organization bent on making super soldiers out of Hyde's advanced physiology,

16:58.200 --> 17:02.840
a mystery regarding how Jackman came to exist because Jekyll died a virgin.

17:02.840 --> 17:08.280
Henry Jekyll died of— Henry Jekyll didn't have any—

17:08.280 --> 17:09.080
Do you get it?

17:09.080 --> 17:14.120
An unrelated mystery about human cloning that sort of comes in out of nowhere and, by the way, isn't

17:14.120 --> 17:17.880
the resolution of the why Jackman exists and looks exactly like Jekyll plot

17:17.880 --> 17:19.720
because Moffat felt like being clever.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.920
Hyde starts screaming,

17:20.920 --> 17:23.480
Why am I not a superman like a tiny baby?

17:23.480 --> 17:27.000
And Jackman and Hyde merge their personalities.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.080
And all the electricity turns off and he has mind powers and—

17:31.080 --> 17:34.360
Oh, and for some reason, a bunch of characters and lines that could have been ripped whole cloth

17:34.360 --> 17:38.280
from coupling start turning up in this horror drama four episodes in.

17:38.280 --> 17:42.280
But the show even commits, in my opinion based on what I liked about it,

17:42.280 --> 17:43.640
the cardinal sin.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.640
It shows the backstory.

17:45.640 --> 17:50.840
The fourth episode is almost entirely long flashbacks showing Jackman gaining the condition

17:50.840 --> 17:53.480
and starting to discover it and figure out how to manage it.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.200
That's right.

17:54.200 --> 17:59.480
Moffat starts in media res, smartly skipping explaining an origin story that's not necessary

17:59.480 --> 18:02.920
for getting to the interesting bits that take place in the first episode

18:02.920 --> 18:05.560
and then goes back to explain it.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.680
The show ends with Jackman's mother, who has appeared intermittently,

18:08.680 --> 18:13.560
suddenly transforming into the lady who runs the organization that's trying to study Hyde.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.800
It's a twist intended to set up a second series and its own deeper mysteries or whatever,

18:17.800 --> 18:21.240
but the show was cancelled, so we'll never find out what happens next,

18:21.240 --> 18:24.680
why Jackman's mother's alter ego was trying to study Hyde in the first place

18:24.680 --> 18:26.680
given she could have just studied herself,

18:26.680 --> 18:28.600
why Jekyll is so goddamn important,

18:28.600 --> 18:32.040
or how the company got so big and rich and powerful over the course of 100 years

18:32.040 --> 18:34.840
when it's run by a woman who couldn't have been around for more than 60 of them

18:34.840 --> 18:38.040
and all their money was revealed to have come from studying imperfect clones of Jekyll

18:38.040 --> 18:39.720
and their cloning was only achieved in the 50s,

18:39.720 --> 18:43.320
so how did they get the riches required to learn to fucking clone humans before then?

18:43.320 --> 18:46.040
And it turns out that love is what made Jekyll become Hyde in the first place

18:46.040 --> 18:47.240
because there is no potion!

18:47.240 --> 18:50.040
So they even ruined the premise of the original fucking book!

18:50.040 --> 18:53.960
Most importantly, the key word I would associate with Jekyll is promise.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.760
Jekyll has, for all its faults, a very strong pilot episode

18:56.760 --> 18:59.800
and honestly, Moffat should just write pilot episodes for the rest of his life

18:59.800 --> 19:02.280
and then hand the rest of the series off to other writers

19:02.280 --> 19:04.280
to play on the interesting ideas he brings up

19:04.280 --> 19:06.200
and then abandons while trying to be smart

19:06.200 --> 19:08.680
or outsmart the source material.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.280
Moffat desperately needs people slapping his wrists away from the keyboard

19:12.280 --> 19:14.280
when he decides to write an episode of backstory

19:14.280 --> 19:17.320
to a show that started strong specifically by not having any.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.560
So we're left with two pilots penned by Moffat

19:19.560 --> 19:22.760
which both promise really interesting and good shows and work

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
basically all the way through on their own level

19:24.760 --> 19:28.600
but then the actual shows in question fail to live up to any of those ideas.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.280
Also, I kind of have to bring this up,

19:30.280 --> 19:32.920
the editing of the show is pretty bad

19:32.920 --> 19:36.040
but it's clear the editors were given very little to work with.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.880
Most of the fights happen off-screen.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.960
Here's the scene where Hyde throws a guy out a window.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.260
Cheers.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.640
They play a glass smashing sound effect before cutting

19:49.640 --> 19:51.560
and then it cuts to him getting off the ground.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.880
They simply didn't shoot the money shot of this scene

19:53.880 --> 19:56.040
of the guy actually getting thrown through the window.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.680
The editor had to really stretch the shots they had

19:58.680 --> 20:01.480
to make the scene have any continuity whatsoever

20:01.480 --> 20:03.880
and you can almost feel the editor's anger

20:03.880 --> 20:07.000
at whoever decided not to shoot most of the interesting events

20:07.000 --> 20:08.440
called for in the script.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.440
By far the funniest part of the show is this outtake

20:10.440 --> 20:12.840
an editor left in that nobody seemed to notice

20:12.840 --> 20:15.720
where Hyde uses his superpowers to pull out a book of matches

20:15.720 --> 20:16.920
and light one out of nowhere

20:16.920 --> 20:21.720
but Nesbitt accidentally flings the entire pack directly into his face and eyes.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.280
They try and cut away but all they can cut to

20:24.280 --> 20:27.640
is this other angle of him doing the same thing.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.800
It's like, wow, do you have a take

20:29.800 --> 20:32.920
where he doesn't throw the matches into his face?

20:34.120 --> 20:34.620
No?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.480
Oh, well, we have to go with this then.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.880
Actually, considering the way a lot of the show plays out

20:39.880 --> 20:41.720
and the lack of coverage everywhere else,

20:41.720 --> 20:44.520
I'm willing to bet they didn't even shoot a second take at all.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.680
I've spent so long laboring on Jekyll,

20:46.680 --> 20:48.600
well, partially because I watched six hours of it

20:48.600 --> 20:51.480
preparing for this video and wanted to justify the wasted time,

20:51.480 --> 20:53.240
but also because it's very much a blueprint

20:53.240 --> 20:55.400
for a lot of the mistakes in Sherlock's writing.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.880
What Moffat's really good at is telling single stories

20:57.880 --> 21:01.000
that have to start and then end conclusively

21:01.000 --> 21:03.320
because you're never gonna see most of these characters

21:03.320 --> 21:04.840
or even this planet again.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.920
You can't just set up the next season

21:06.920 --> 21:08.920
with a hackneyed cliffhanger or whatever.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.560
You have to end the story satisfyingly.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.600
It needs a big, strong idea every week.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.640
I think you know you've got a good idea for a Doctor Who story

21:17.640 --> 21:21.400
if you think, well, I've just blown that feature film idea forever, haven't I?

21:21.400 --> 21:21.720
Right.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.800
That's the size of story that gets you through 45 minutes of Doctor Who.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.560
Compare and contrast the writing of this scene

21:27.560 --> 21:29.560
from The Empty Child in season one.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.800
The Doctor follows a mysterious Mauve object

21:31.800 --> 21:33.400
through time as it crashes on Earth

21:33.400 --> 21:35.320
and, assuming it would have made an impression,

21:35.320 --> 21:36.600
decides to ask the locals

21:36.600 --> 21:38.120
if they've seen something fall from the sky.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.600
It might seem like a stupid question,

21:41.160 --> 21:43.400
but has anything fallen from the sky recently?

21:51.640 --> 21:52.840
That's a weird response.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.360
He doesn't get it and neither do you.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.480
What's going on?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.320
And then an air raid siren goes off

21:57.320 --> 21:59.640
and he sees the wartime posters and you go,

21:59.640 --> 22:03.160
Oh, it's the war!

22:03.160 --> 22:05.800
This is a clever and simple setup and reveal.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.040
Over the course of the episode and the second part,

22:08.040 --> 22:10.360
we learn what the ship was, what it does,

22:10.360 --> 22:11.640
what's happened in London,

22:11.640 --> 22:13.000
and by the end of these two episodes,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.400
you have a complete picture of what happened and why.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.000
Also, a guy's face gets turned into a gas mask by nanomachines

22:19.000 --> 22:21.400
and it's the scariest thing anyone my age

22:21.400 --> 22:23.880
has ever seen in their entire lives.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.720
There's good writing and a good story here

22:25.720 --> 22:27.560
with a conclusion that feels earned.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.760
Moffat's supposedly famous for writing the more dark episodes,

22:30.760 --> 22:32.040
but at the end of this one,

22:32.040 --> 22:35.160
everyone who has died comes back to life.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.600
Like, he un-kills people

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
and yet the tone carries it,

22:46.600 --> 22:48.200
makes it feel dark even then.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.360
That's just how good he is

22:50.360 --> 22:52.280
when he's given a single story to tell.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.520
But when Moffat has to write the whole series

23:00.520 --> 23:02.360
and manage the wider progression,

23:02.360 --> 23:03.640
you start to see holes.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.520
Things start being implied that sound deep,

23:06.520 --> 23:08.680
seem like they might be going somewhere,

23:08.680 --> 23:09.880
but actually don't.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.560
His first season starts with the Doctor

23:11.560 --> 23:13.000
finding a crack in space and time

23:13.000 --> 23:15.880
on the bedroom wall of a girl he happens to run into,

23:15.880 --> 23:17.240
and then the cracks keep turning up

23:17.240 --> 23:19.080
and a piece of the TARDIS comes through one.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.600
Where did the cracks come from?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.520
Keep watching and maybe you'll find out.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.040
Then it turns out they come from the TARDIS

23:24.040 --> 23:25.560
exploding at the end of the season.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.480
But why did the TARDIS explode?

23:27.480 --> 23:29.320
Keep watching and maybe you'll find out.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.000
Oh, the silence did it?

23:31.480 --> 23:33.400
Maybe. I'm still not clear.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.440
Why did they do it?

23:34.440 --> 23:36.200
Well, keep watching and maybe you'll find out.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.960
Oh, they did it because there's a prophecy

23:37.960 --> 23:41.400
that silence must fall when the question is asked.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.680
Who made this prophecy,

23:42.680 --> 23:44.120
and what the hell does it mean?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.200
Keep watching for yet another fucking season

23:46.200 --> 23:47.000
and maybe...

23:47.000 --> 23:49.880
Bzzzzt....

23:49.880 --> 23:51.640
It also feels like Moffat really did use up

23:51.640 --> 23:52.680
all his feature film ideas

23:52.680 --> 23:54.440
because he brings back the Weeping Angels

23:54.440 --> 23:55.400
for a two-part episode

23:55.400 --> 23:57.080
and then they come back again later,

23:57.080 --> 23:58.760
even more.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.840
In the first series, which is still my favorite,

24:00.840 --> 24:02.600
they would have the Doctor do something shitty

24:02.600 --> 24:04.120
like torture a Dalek,

24:04.120 --> 24:06.280
and he would have to confront himself that episode

24:06.280 --> 24:07.720
and get better as a person.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.640
Say what you want about Russell T. Davies,

24:09.640 --> 24:10.600
but under his watch,

24:10.600 --> 24:12.680
almost every episode would feel involving

24:12.680 --> 24:14.520
because characters would change or grow

24:14.520 --> 24:15.880
or have to actually confront

24:15.880 --> 24:17.720
and deal with something about themselves.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.160
Why don't you finish the job

24:19.160 --> 24:20.920
and make the Daleks extinct?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.680
Rid the universe of your filth!

24:22.680 --> 24:23.960
Rid the universe of your filth!

24:23.960 --> 24:25.160
Why don't you just die?!

24:28.600 --> 24:31.960
You would make a good Dalek.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.600
This episode explores the Doctor's anger at the Daleks

24:42.600 --> 24:45.080
and shows it's an expression of seeing his entire race

24:45.080 --> 24:46.360
die in a war with them.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.640
Over the course of this episode,

24:47.640 --> 24:49.480
he has to confront these feelings

24:49.480 --> 24:50.920
in ways he hasn't let himself

24:50.920 --> 24:52.200
and grow as a person.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.640
It's a really small change,

24:53.640 --> 24:55.320
but we get to see it happen,

24:55.320 --> 24:56.280
and it's good.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.600
In contrast, here's a superficially similar scene

24:58.600 --> 24:59.720
in a Moffat-run season

24:59.720 --> 25:01.560
in an episode co-written by Moffat.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.560
You are a good Dalek.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.920
This happens at the end of an episode.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.440
The purpose of this scene

25:10.440 --> 25:12.680
is to tell you that the Doctor is full of hatred.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.920
Not so we can deal with that hatred being there

25:14.920 --> 25:16.760
in the actual story of the episode

25:16.760 --> 25:19.080
or explore these emotions in more detail,

25:19.080 --> 25:20.760
but to make you watch the next episode

25:20.760 --> 25:23.000
to see if maybe they'll eventually deal

25:23.000 --> 25:24.200
with the interesting thing

25:24.200 --> 25:25.560
they brought up and did nothing with.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.560
I see into your soul, Doctor.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.040
I see hatred!

25:33.240 --> 25:35.000
Oh, I've looked into your soul.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.680
I see hatred, Doctor.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.000
Hatred that a future episode

25:39.000 --> 25:41.720
might eventually fucking deal with and be interesting.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.200
Do you have it in you to murder me?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.120
Did he push you out of that thing?

25:46.760 --> 25:47.560
Or did you fall?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.080
Couldn't really tell.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.520
You can be very mean sometimes.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.080
We get it.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.160
The Doctor's an ambiguous character now.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.920
Are you gonna explore that in more detail

25:56.920 --> 25:58.520
or are you just gonna keep telling us that?

25:58.520 --> 25:59.400
For all his flaws,

25:59.400 --> 26:01.480
Davies tried to make each episode

26:01.480 --> 26:03.240
have a satisfying complete story

26:03.240 --> 26:04.680
and arc for its characters.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.640
I'm the only one left.

26:06.680 --> 26:07.180
I win.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.400
How about that?

26:09.400 --> 26:10.600
Moffat, as a showrunner,

26:10.600 --> 26:12.520
tries to make each episode imply

26:12.520 --> 26:15.880
something satisfying is maybe gonna happen eventually.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.200
You can have all the fantastic premises you like,

26:18.200 --> 26:21.400
shrinking yourself down to go inside a Dalek to do surgery,

26:21.400 --> 26:24.040
having a sword fight with Robin Hood with a spoon,

26:24.040 --> 26:26.840
having to go on a space bank heist with strangers,

26:26.840 --> 26:27.400
whatever,

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
but if most of the time the conclusion is,

26:29.400 --> 26:31.160
wow, you've got some anger, Doctor,

26:31.160 --> 26:33.560
I bet a future episode might bother to deal with it,

26:33.560 --> 26:36.280
those episodes are wasting a lot of their potential.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.840
Again, this is something Moffat grasped excellently

26:38.840 --> 26:40.600
when he was writing one-off episodes.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.840
Blink starred characters that were never seen before

26:42.840 --> 26:44.120
and haven't been seen since,

26:44.120 --> 26:46.120
but it has a complete emotional arc

26:46.120 --> 26:48.680
for its main characters over the course of one episode.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.120
It doesn't end with someone saying,

26:50.120 --> 26:52.920
wow, you have problems you probably ought to deal with at some point.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.840
Tune in next week to see if we do.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.240
The problem is, when you come down to it,

26:57.240 --> 26:59.400
Doctor Who is about visiting other worlds

26:59.400 --> 27:00.840
and going on fun adventures.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
Moffat made it all about the Doctor.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.760
In much the same way,

27:04.760 --> 27:07.160
the Sherlock Holmes stories are about solving crimes

27:07.160 --> 27:09.000
and fun mysteries and figuring things out

27:09.000 --> 27:10.280
using deductive reasoning.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.400
Moffat made his show all about Sherlock.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.880
Sherlock is too important, too special, too powerful,

27:19.880 --> 27:21.560
and this ruins the tension of the show

27:21.560 --> 27:23.720
and our ability to empathize with the character.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.520
The entire show is dedicated to telling you about Sherlock

27:26.520 --> 27:28.040
instead of showing you Sherlock

27:28.040 --> 27:30.440
by way of his interaction with the actual plot.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.640
Season 1 was the only season that came close to getting this right,

27:33.640 --> 27:36.120
where you learned what sort of person he was and his abilities

27:36.120 --> 27:38.120
based on how he used them in the episode.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.280
As the show progresses, the actual mystery,

27:40.280 --> 27:43.800
you know, the crimes we're supposed to have fun watching Sherlock solve,

27:43.800 --> 27:45.400
take a back seat to the show telling us

27:45.400 --> 27:47.720
how cool and wacky Sherlock is

27:47.720 --> 27:49.880
and his mind battle with Moriarty.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.400
In this episode in Season 3,

27:51.400 --> 27:54.120
there's a huge setup just for Sherlock being weird.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.840
They spend a pretty sizable portion of the runtime and budget

27:56.840 --> 27:59.960
for a quick joke about how rude and thoughtless Sherlock is

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
while Lestrade is gearing up to capture someone

28:01.960 --> 28:03.880
who's clearly been a problem with him for a long time.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.040
I-I-I have to go.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.800
Are there any funny stories about John?

28:09.800 --> 28:11.480
They could have just made him rude and thoughtless

28:11.480 --> 28:15.080
over the course of the plot of the actual fucking episode.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.320
The punchline of these jokes is supposed to set up something

28:17.320 --> 28:18.600
regarding the principal characters,

28:18.600 --> 28:21.000
but they do it so poorly and in such a roundabout way

28:21.000 --> 28:23.800
that they're neither funny nor really tell us anything new.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.520
We should already know Sherlock is a big inconsiderate piece of shit

28:26.520 --> 28:28.440
because Moffat has been writing him as one

28:28.440 --> 28:30.040
for three seasons at this point.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.880
This kind of overindulgent nonsense

28:31.880 --> 28:34.600
is antithetical to actually telling an interesting story.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.080
Nothing remotely like this would have happened in the short stories

28:37.080 --> 28:38.760
because they actually had a story worth telling

28:38.760 --> 28:40.120
and wanted to get to it.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.680
Cumulatively, stuff like this reduces the entire show

28:42.680 --> 28:46.280
to Sherlock prancing around showing off how smart and or rude he is

28:46.280 --> 28:49.880
and very occasionally pausing to do something.

28:49.880 --> 28:50.840
I'll get hung for this.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.040
No, no, no, Mr. Pirk, not at all.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.240
Hanged?

28:55.240 --> 28:56.200
Yes.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.880
Sherlock corrects a guy's grammar a bunch

28:57.880 --> 29:00.520
for the first two minutes of this episode and then walks away.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.960
This doesn't serve the story at all

29:01.960 --> 29:04.840
except to tell us that Sherlock doesn't like when you say words wrong,

29:04.840 --> 29:07.320
which is, you know, an admirable character trait, obviously.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.800
Fuck that guy. He deserves to die even if he didn't do the murder.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.160
But it's really not something so pivotal as to be the start of an episode.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.000
It's a show about solving crimes.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.360
The episode should be starting with...

29:17.080 --> 29:20.600
A crime! A thing happens that pequees your interest,

29:20.600 --> 29:22.280
like the first two episodes did.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.520
But by the time of the third episode,

29:24.520 --> 29:26.280
we open on Sherlock being shitty,

29:26.280 --> 29:28.520
dramatically walking out and the credits go,

29:28.520 --> 29:31.240
and then we cut to Sherlock being shitty in his house for another three minutes.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.920
Ooh, there's a head.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.320
Ooh, there's a head in the fridge. How wacky.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.720
The actual start of the episode's fucking plot

29:39.720 --> 29:41.720
is at around 6 minutes 20 seconds

29:41.720 --> 29:44.680
when someone suddenly attacks the house out of nowhere with a bomb.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.960
Everything leading up to that is Sherlock being bored and smarmy

29:47.960 --> 29:51.240
and literally waiting around for the plot to come and get him.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.480
Now, this characterization isn't utterly terrible.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.200
We do have a strong sense that Sherlock is a dick.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.040
But the problem with this is that, in effect,

29:58.040 --> 30:01.640
the entire show is bent towards providing characterization for Sherlock

30:01.640 --> 30:04.440
and making the story he's interacting with take a back seat

30:04.440 --> 30:06.040
until it becomes convenient.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.600
In the actual books and many of the adaptations,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.920
Sherlock Holmes was not the real focal point.

30:10.920 --> 30:14.200
The mystery at hand and the other characters were equally as important,

30:14.200 --> 30:17.880
and the point was the way Sherlock interacted with them to help solve the case.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.840
Let's take the very first story, A Study in Scarlet.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.440
Sherlock, while examining the body, refers to pre-existing events he's clearly studied

30:24.440 --> 30:26.680
and actively recommends others do the same.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.680
Instead of simply telling everyone how smart he is,

30:28.680 --> 30:31.880
he makes a tangible reference to a piece of information that could be relevant.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.800
We're seeing his reasoning in action.

30:33.800 --> 30:37.000
We're also getting strong characterization while the plot moves forward

30:37.080 --> 30:38.920
of Sherlock checking the body

30:38.920 --> 30:42.280
and making comments that teach us about Sherlock and about the case.

30:42.280 --> 30:45.160
Characterization and story are happening at the same time

30:45.160 --> 30:49.320
and not in separate segments for the first six minutes before the story decides to start.

30:49.320 --> 30:53.400
Lestrade assumes R-A-C-H-E written in blood on a wall are meant to say Rachel

30:53.400 --> 30:55.960
and the killer was disturbed before they could finish writing

30:55.960 --> 30:59.240
and that someone called Rachel therefore has something to do with the case.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.600
That's all he gets from this scene,

31:00.600 --> 31:03.000
the assumption that these words might say Rachel,

31:03.000 --> 31:04.440
which it turns out they don't.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.520
Sherlock looks at this scene and deduces, for example,

31:06.520 --> 31:08.760
the approximate height of the person who wrote the message

31:08.760 --> 31:11.000
based on where it had made sense for them to write the letters.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.480
Something no one else in the room thought to observe or consider

31:13.480 --> 31:15.720
but something that you could absolutely arrive at yourself.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.480
This is a tangible piece of information that you yourself could apply to real life.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.120
Sherlock just taught you how to figure out how tall someone is

31:22.120 --> 31:24.120
based on how they would naturally write on a wall

31:24.120 --> 31:26.600
or the length of the stride of their footprints.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.440
This characterization is very strong because it gets across that Sherlock is smart

31:30.440 --> 31:32.440
but also why he's smart,

31:32.440 --> 31:34.680
what he did to learn the things he learned

31:34.680 --> 31:36.600
and got across the point of the scene

31:36.600 --> 31:39.480
which is to demonstrate the use of his analytical techniques.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.120
For comparison, there's a scene in the first Sherlock episode,

31:42.120 --> 31:43.240
a study in pink,

31:43.240 --> 31:44.200
ooh, do you get it?

31:44.200 --> 31:44.840
How clever!

31:44.840 --> 31:47.960
where Sherlock goes to a crime scene clearly based on the one from Scarlet.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.200
Rach here is written by the victim

31:50.200 --> 31:53.720
and it actually turns out that she really is trying to write the name Rachel

31:53.720 --> 31:57.240
because knowing German, I guess, is too much to expect of an audience.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.320
This isn't necessarily a bad change.

31:59.320 --> 32:03.240
What is a bad change is what information Sherlock learns and how he learns it.

32:03.240 --> 32:06.520
We're shown Sherlock inspecting the body and instead making the conclusion,

32:06.520 --> 32:09.560
based on the inside of a dirty wedding ring being clean,

32:09.560 --> 32:11.400
that the woman is a serial adulterer.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.040
This actually doesn't have very much impact on the story whatsoever,

32:14.040 --> 32:15.880
it's just the writers finding a way to be clever

32:15.880 --> 32:18.680
by having Sherlock derive an entire sexual history from a ring.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.680
He then realizes something no one else notices and dramatically runs off screaming,

32:22.680 --> 32:24.280
PINK!

32:24.280 --> 32:26.280
This is tonally, utterly wrong.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.360
Instead of being given tangible explanations

32:28.360 --> 32:31.480
and the intrigue coming from deciding what to do next with the information

32:31.480 --> 32:32.600
in order to catch the killer,

32:32.600 --> 32:35.720
you're told to assume someone's marriage is failing because their ring is dirty

32:35.720 --> 32:37.720
and that Sherlock knows something you don't

32:37.720 --> 32:39.720
and has just run off to deal with it himself.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.120
The tone here is utter confusion.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.200
Sherlock's smart because he figured something out,

32:44.200 --> 32:47.320
but we're not gonna say what or how or why.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.120
Just for contrast,

32:48.120 --> 32:51.560
the first time we see CBS's elementaries Sherlock on a crime scene,

32:51.560 --> 32:54.920
he discovers a hidden room by feeling the incline of the floor with his feet.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.360
The extra weight of the Saffron steel reinforcements

32:58.360 --> 33:00.680
can cause the floor around it to decline slightly,

33:00.680 --> 33:04.520
creating a slope between one and five degrees.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.200
This thing with the marble is clever

33:14.200 --> 33:16.440
and based on quite simple available information,

33:16.440 --> 33:19.640
like that big armored panic rooms are heavy.

33:19.640 --> 33:20.760
It's not rocket science,

33:20.760 --> 33:22.440
but it's a believable deduction

33:22.440 --> 33:26.360
and it did just teach you an actual real-life way of finding hidden panic rooms.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.800
This show might not be perfect,

33:27.800 --> 33:28.520
but at least they...

33:29.480 --> 33:31.400
solve crimes?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.000
Using information they detected?

33:34.040 --> 33:35.480
Like detectives would?

33:35.480 --> 33:39.000
This early scene is the best analysis in the show you're gonna get, too.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.120
You are shown pieces of information that lead to a conclusion.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.160
For example, he recognizes that she would have had to have a suitcase with her

33:45.160 --> 33:46.200
because of splash marks,

33:46.200 --> 33:49.240
which the viewers even shown and has a chance to figure out for themselves

33:49.240 --> 33:50.520
before Sherlock explains it.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.600
But in most investigations after this one,

33:52.600 --> 33:54.760
Sherlock starts either making wild assumptions

33:54.760 --> 33:56.520
that don't have any basis in reality

33:56.520 --> 33:59.720
or straight-up learns key information the viewer isn't even told about.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.440
In episode two,

34:00.440 --> 34:03.560
Sherlock assumes a man found with a gunshot on the right side of his head

34:03.560 --> 34:06.120
couldn't be self-inflicted because he was left-handed.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.560
The wound's on the right side of his head.

34:07.560 --> 34:07.800
And?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.160
Vancombe is left-handed.

34:09.720 --> 34:11.720
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.480
This isn't even a solid assumption.

34:13.480 --> 34:16.920
In practice, plenty of left-handed people use their other hand for firearms

34:16.920 --> 34:18.200
so that the kickback of the weapon

34:18.200 --> 34:20.760
doesn't potentially injure the hand you use for writing with,

34:20.760 --> 34:22.760
including, say, for example,

34:22.760 --> 34:23.560
John Watson.

34:26.120 --> 34:26.760
Bing.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.480
In episode three,

34:27.480 --> 34:30.360
Sherlock has to figure out how a TV personality lady was poisoned.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.640
He sends Watson to the lady's house

34:31.640 --> 34:33.160
and we get scenes of him checking stuff out

34:33.160 --> 34:34.840
and Sherlock starting to watch a few episodes

34:34.840 --> 34:36.200
and check the internet for theories.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.680
The characters meet up and Sherlock just sort of throws out there

34:38.680 --> 34:41.400
that the houseboy who is in a relationship with the lady's brother

34:41.400 --> 34:44.680
probably poisoned her in revenge for mistreatment of the brother on TV

34:44.680 --> 34:46.600
based on all the research he did off-screen.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.600
All we see of this research is her patting him a little bit too hard on the back.

34:50.600 --> 34:54.680
Sherlock proves this theory by having a toxicology report come in

34:54.680 --> 34:56.360
and show it was botulinum toxin

34:56.360 --> 34:58.680
and that the houseboy's job was to give her Botox

34:58.680 --> 35:00.840
and that he knows he's been bulk-ordering it.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.000
My contact at the home office gave me the complete records

35:03.000 --> 35:04.280
of Raoul's internet purchases.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.120
He's been bulk-ordering Botox for months.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.400
Buy it at his time, then up the strength to a fatal dose.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.040
That's right.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.880
In a show about solving crimes

35:11.880 --> 35:14.440
and giving the viewer a sense of unfolding mystery

35:14.440 --> 35:15.880
and maybe giving them some information

35:15.880 --> 35:18.280
so they can try and figure it out themselves as they go

35:18.280 --> 35:19.960
so, you know, their brain is engaged.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.280
Sherlock solves the crime off-screen using information the viewer has never shown

35:24.280 --> 35:26.680
or even has a chance to deduce for themselves.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.240
He just comes out of nowhere and reveals it was Botox

35:29.240 --> 35:32.440
and that he has a friend with the power to find out people's internet purchases

35:32.440 --> 35:33.480
and share them with him.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.760
The ability to be intelligent in finding and interpreting available information

35:36.760 --> 35:38.280
is replaced with a superpower

35:38.280 --> 35:41.560
where he holds all the cards and knows more than the viewer possibly could,

35:41.560 --> 35:44.360
rendering the experience of trying to follow the story

35:44.440 --> 35:47.320
roughly similar to trying to figure out where a car is driving

35:47.320 --> 35:48.600
while there's a bag over your head

35:48.600 --> 35:51.800
and Stephen Moffat is punching you and insisting he's being clever.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.160
In this same episode,

35:53.160 --> 35:56.520
based on a guard being found dead who works in a gallery,

35:57.080 --> 35:59.240
he immediately then arrives at the conclusion

35:59.240 --> 36:01.720
that a recent painting unveiled there has to be fake

36:01.720 --> 36:03.880
because why else would anyone ever be killed?

36:04.520 --> 36:08.200
And then he concludes based on circumstantial evidence

36:08.200 --> 36:11.800
that a well-known legendary hitman we've never heard of before must have done it.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.560
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.640
That is his trademark style.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.280
And then someone off-screen finds out where he is

36:18.280 --> 36:20.920
and then they go to where he is.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.360
Any time you want to explain?

36:22.360 --> 36:25.320
Homeless network really is indispensable.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.880
Like, all the deduction and thinking

36:27.880 --> 36:31.960
isn't done in a way that is actually interesting or fun for the viewer to see.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.880
How would a person track this hitman?

36:33.880 --> 36:35.480
How would you find out where he is?

36:35.480 --> 36:37.000
That's an interesting story.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.200
They skip over it.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.520
Sherlock literally hires someone else to do it

36:40.520 --> 36:41.720
and they do all of this

36:41.720 --> 36:44.200
so that Sherlock and Watson have an excuse to run around

36:44.840 --> 36:48.280
chasing a really tall guy and then having a wrestle with him.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.600
You know, yeah, the original stories were fantastic

36:50.600 --> 36:53.960
and groundbreaking pieces of literature about solving mysteries

36:53.960 --> 36:55.240
but what they really could have done with

36:55.240 --> 36:57.880
was a bit where the main characters wrestle a tall guy for a while.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.880
I'll say again that the show does start out better

36:59.880 --> 37:02.760
and lots of season one does feature some genuine deduction

37:02.760 --> 37:04.600
based on information the viewers also shown

37:04.600 --> 37:07.080
but you can see the slip starting to happen here.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.120
The deductive reasoning a superior show would be centrally about

37:10.200 --> 37:11.720
is replaced with a conjuring trick

37:11.720 --> 37:14.120
where you're told later how clever Sherlock was

37:14.120 --> 37:15.800
and then he tells you about all the other stuff

37:15.800 --> 37:17.560
you didn't even know about that led him to it.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.760
In The Hounds of Baskerville,

37:18.760 --> 37:20.680
Sherlock intentionally tries to drug Watson

37:20.680 --> 37:23.560
with what he thinks is sugar that's had a hallucinogen added to it

37:23.560 --> 37:25.160
based on how he thinks he's been drugged

37:25.160 --> 37:27.320
and it's the only thing they didn't both consume.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.640
The fact it's the one thing they haven't both eaten or drunk

37:29.640 --> 37:32.120
isn't established until after Watson has been given the sugar

37:32.120 --> 37:33.320
and started hallucinating.

37:33.320 --> 37:36.440
The purpose of this part appears to be to make Sherlock look clever

37:36.440 --> 37:39.880
for knowing something we didn't even have the chance to think about for ourselves.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.640
Also, he could have just tested the sugar

37:41.640 --> 37:44.600
instead of trying to drug his friend with an unknown chemical

37:44.600 --> 37:46.920
to see what would happen and then testing it later

37:46.920 --> 37:48.840
only to discover the sugar is clean.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.160
You can even imagine a better, smarter show

37:51.160 --> 37:53.080
having a section where the two stop

37:53.080 --> 37:54.760
and think about everything they've eaten.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.160
Maybe even cutting back to scenes of everything they ate

37:57.160 --> 37:58.200
that we already saw

37:58.200 --> 37:59.960
because they could have had scenes of them doing that

37:59.960 --> 38:01.080
as other stuff happened

38:01.080 --> 38:03.640
and eliminating everything except the sugar

38:03.640 --> 38:06.760
then testing it in the lab and discovering that it's normal.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.480
Instead, all this information is excised on purpose

38:09.480 --> 38:11.000
so you can have the mystery

38:11.000 --> 38:13.720
of Sherlock maybe drugging his only friend

38:13.720 --> 38:15.240
and fill some precious time

38:15.240 --> 38:17.480
as Watson hides in the lab from an imaginary dog

38:17.480 --> 38:18.600
for five whole minutes.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.360
The story it would have made sense to tell

38:20.360 --> 38:22.840
is just too normal for Moffat and Gatiss.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.080
The real focus is what wacky or cool thing

38:25.080 --> 38:26.680
Sherlock will personally do

38:26.680 --> 38:29.480
and then how he'll justify it later using bullshit

38:29.480 --> 38:32.040
instead of being on the piece of evidence or information

38:32.040 --> 38:34.600
and the proper approach to finding it and acting on it.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.680
This conveniently lets the writers off the hook

38:36.680 --> 38:39.320
for ever having to deal with things like character traits

38:39.320 --> 38:41.480
or motivation or choices.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.640
When you read a chapter of a Sherlock Holmes story,

38:43.640 --> 38:45.640
you feel like you've gotten a little bit smarter.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.000
It feels weird to say out loud

38:47.000 --> 38:49.320
but often it's like you've personally seen the benefit

38:49.320 --> 38:51.080
of a certain way of looking at the world.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.640
Sherlock has the strongest characterization in the show

38:53.640 --> 38:55.560
but, in effect, it's too strong,

38:55.560 --> 38:57.160
pulling the focus away from things

38:57.160 --> 38:59.800
that actually make watching him do stuff interesting

38:59.800 --> 39:01.720
like the other characters and their lives

39:01.720 --> 39:03.320
and the mysteries he's solving.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.840
This is a gigantic problem

39:04.840 --> 39:07.240
in both storytelling and characterization.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.040
A lot of the original stories were only a few pages long.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.800
There wasn't enough time to mythologize

39:11.800 --> 39:13.320
what a badass Sherlock was

39:13.320 --> 39:15.320
because there was crime to solve.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.840
The 90-minute format of the show

39:16.840 --> 39:19.160
seemingly gives the creators too much time.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.920
Hell, the pilot was better

39:20.920 --> 39:22.760
because they didn't have that extra 30 minutes

39:22.760 --> 39:24.520
to shoehorn in the Mycroft stuff

39:24.520 --> 39:25.960
and then tie it all into Moriarty

39:25.960 --> 39:28.120
because why not make it all about him, too?

39:28.120 --> 39:29.320
Speaking of which...

39:31.960 --> 39:34.760
If you thought the show's obsession with Sherlock was too much,

39:34.760 --> 39:36.520
wait until you get a load of Moriarty.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.320
The entire Sherlock world has been almost completely absorbed

39:39.320 --> 39:41.640
into the all-encompassing plans of some guy

39:41.640 --> 39:45.160
who was in two of the many dozens of original stories.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.720
After being suddenly inserted into the first two episodes

39:47.720 --> 39:48.680
to let you know he's coming

39:48.680 --> 39:50.760
so you have something to keep watching for

39:50.760 --> 39:52.360
because the writing and mystery solving

39:52.360 --> 39:53.800
certainly can't be doing that for you,

39:53.800 --> 39:55.640
episode three's all weird mind games

39:55.640 --> 39:57.960
explicitly for Sherlock by Moriarty.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.760
It's all about a big, smart baddie messing with Sherlock

40:00.760 --> 40:02.040
but in a really boring way

40:02.040 --> 40:03.240
where he holds all the cards

40:03.240 --> 40:04.920
and Sherlock never actually outsmarts him,

40:04.920 --> 40:06.040
just solves his puzzles

40:06.040 --> 40:08.840
but he solves them off-screen or using magic mind powers

40:08.840 --> 40:11.000
so it's a struggle we don't even get to see.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.200
There's also the problem of him being relentlessly queer-coded.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.280
Okay.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.880
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.080
Daddy's had enough now.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.160
Seriously, this guy's just the fucking most.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.120
Do you like my boys?

40:25.080 --> 40:26.680
This one's got more stamina

40:26.680 --> 40:30.040
but he's less caring in the afterglow.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.640
What are you doing, Andrew?

40:31.640 --> 40:32.760
Oh, boy.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.880
Do you get it?

40:33.880 --> 40:34.760
He's a queen?

40:35.720 --> 40:37.480
Oh, fuck you, Steve.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.600
Like, I get it.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.360
He's really into Sherlock

40:40.360 --> 40:43.800
and the writers imply this means he wants to do the fuck on him

40:43.800 --> 40:46.120
but, like, why?

40:46.680 --> 40:48.440
What does this add to the narrative?

40:48.440 --> 40:52.120
Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain

40:52.120 --> 40:55.480
so we thought someone who was genuinely, properly frightening.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.520
Someone who's an absolute psycho, Moffat.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.020
Okay.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.760
Number one, absolute psycho.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.960
Make him act like a gay.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.520
Great, that's really fucking comforting of you.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.020
Thank you.

41:07.800 --> 41:12.280
Number two, Moriarty, dull and posh?

41:12.840 --> 41:18.600
One of the most memorable fucking characters in, like, the history of literature?

41:19.240 --> 41:20.200
Oh, yeah.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.720
He needs to be fixed.

41:21.720 --> 41:26.920
We need to make him into the fucking loudest, shoutingest, prancingest,

41:27.640 --> 41:29.960
weirdest, most over-the-top guy ever.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.480
Just, you know.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.920
Because we really needed to fucking fix Moria—

41:34.920 --> 41:35.640
You f—

41:35.640 --> 41:36.840
Jesus Christ.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.320
Moriarty is self-consciously a villain.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.360
He knows what he's doing.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.880
He's a nutcase.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.120
He knows what he's doing and he's a nutcase?

41:44.760 --> 41:46.840
Uh, Mark, those—

41:46.840 --> 41:47.720
Those things don't—

41:47.720 --> 41:49.320
See? He's an absolute psycho

41:49.320 --> 41:51.480
which means the creators can have him do anything,

41:51.480 --> 41:53.320
even contradictory things like

41:53.320 --> 41:55.480
threaten Sherlock to try and keep him away

41:55.480 --> 41:58.200
and do everything he can to protect his identity

41:58.200 --> 42:02.280
and needlessly play with Sherlock up to and including fucking just killing himself

42:02.280 --> 42:03.800
just to mess with his head

42:03.800 --> 42:05.880
and they don't have to justify any of it

42:05.880 --> 42:07.720
because he's a complete psycho.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.320
He doesn't have to make any sense.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.320
We don't have to write a cohesive character.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.920
He's mad and that's it.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.360
That's all you're gonna get.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.400
Fuck you.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.640
At the end of season one slash beginning of two,

42:17.640 --> 42:19.640
he threatens them, leaves,

42:19.640 --> 42:21.320
realizes he should probably kill them,

42:21.320 --> 42:22.600
comes back in to do it,

42:22.600 --> 42:26.200
then changes his mind again once the cliffhanger's over and season two starts.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.040
What's the lesson here?

42:28.120 --> 42:29.320
Also, why does he come back in?

42:29.320 --> 42:30.280
He could have just said,

42:30.280 --> 42:31.480
hey, snipers, just kill him.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.720
The villain is practically all-powerful,

42:33.720 --> 42:36.680
doesn't kill Sherlock for the sake of the fun of messing with him,

42:36.680 --> 42:39.960
and Sherlock never, ever gets the upper hand or surprises him

42:39.960 --> 42:41.880
because he's so ridiculously smart.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.360
This makes the conflict have no real weight for the viewer

42:44.360 --> 42:46.040
and thereby render it pointless.

42:46.040 --> 42:49.960
Moriarty always holds all the cards and knows more than Sherlock does.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.720
Boring!

42:51.720 --> 42:53.720
I could have got them anywhere.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.840
In the books, when he's tracking down other criminals and, of course, Moriarty,

42:56.840 --> 42:59.320
Sherlock has to try very hard not to get murdered,

42:59.320 --> 43:01.640
and in the original novel, literally does

43:01.640 --> 43:05.320
because Moriarty and himself end up shuffling off the Reichenbach Falls together.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.280
In this version, Moriarty literally doesn't want Sherlock dead

43:08.280 --> 43:10.680
and he doesn't really care about his crime empire

43:10.680 --> 43:13.960
because he shoots himself in the head simply as a ploy to mess with him.

43:13.960 --> 43:17.160
He's just fucking around with an impossibly genius-level intellect

43:17.160 --> 43:18.600
to seemingly no end,

43:18.600 --> 43:20.440
except literally his own.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.440
Sometimes he's a pragmatic mastermind

43:22.440 --> 43:26.120
who'll do anything to protect even the vaguest sliver of his identity,

43:26.120 --> 43:27.720
like have this lady murdered

43:27.720 --> 43:31.880
or detonate the bombs on the old woman when she tries to tell Sherlock he sounded nice.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.840
If you don't stop prying...

43:36.200 --> 43:38.200
I will burn you.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.880
I will burn...

43:41.880 --> 43:43.880
a horse out of you.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.280
Why not just burn him anyway?

43:46.280 --> 43:51.080
Why make this allowance for the one man who actually stands a chance of ever catching you?

43:51.080 --> 43:53.160
Oh, oh, because he's crazy.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.320
So we don't have to justify it. He's crazy.

43:55.320 --> 43:57.720
The original Moriarty shows up in two stories,

43:57.720 --> 44:01.000
is formidable and wants Sherlock dead for fucking with him,

44:01.000 --> 44:04.200
and the two die in mortal combat trying to kill each other,

44:04.200 --> 44:06.600
although Sherlock is eventually revealed to have survived

44:06.600 --> 44:09.720
after a full decade of readers being convinced he was dead.

44:09.720 --> 44:13.160
This Moriarty runs seemingly all crime everywhere,

44:13.160 --> 44:15.720
will go to great lengths to protect his identity,

44:15.720 --> 44:17.880
but is also so fascinated by Sherlock,

44:17.880 --> 44:20.360
he'll literally kill himself to see what he does

44:20.360 --> 44:21.960
while gaybaiting the fuck out of him

44:21.960 --> 44:24.120
so Tumblr will give it some shipping attention.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.520
Then, when Sherlock dies to stop his plans,

44:26.520 --> 44:28.680
ten minutes later it turns out Sherlock isn't dead

44:28.680 --> 44:31.400
because the writers can't even trust you to wait for the next season

44:31.400 --> 44:34.040
because they're rightfully worried you'd lose interest in this garbage

44:34.040 --> 44:35.800
if the story felt too conclusive.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.320
He kills himself because I guess they wanted him to do something surprising.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.320
The most essential thing about Moriarty for me

44:41.320 --> 44:44.440
is that you don't know what you're gonna get on the day,

44:44.440 --> 44:46.920
that he has to be completely surprising.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.880
So they had him do the stupidest fucking thing possible.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.480
The only way this could be stupider

44:51.480 --> 44:54.440
is if right before he shot himself in the head for no reason,

44:54.440 --> 44:56.280
he told Sherlock he was going to come back

44:56.280 --> 44:58.040
for every season finale afterwards

44:58.040 --> 45:00.840
as an increasingly stupid and bullshit fake-out

45:00.840 --> 45:04.760
or that Sherlock has a secret sister he magically forgot about

45:04.760 --> 45:08.360
and also a mega super double secret old best friend

45:08.360 --> 45:10.920
who he remembers as a dog for some reason

45:10.920 --> 45:12.440
and who the sister killed.

45:12.440 --> 45:14.280
That would be really stupid, wouldn't it?

45:14.280 --> 45:17.160
But Moriarty's shitty characterization doesn't end there.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.760
After the big twist in season two

45:18.760 --> 45:21.320
that there is no secret all-powerful hacking technology,

45:21.400 --> 45:23.720
No, no, no, no, no.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.600
This is too easy. This is too easy.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.120
There is no key.

45:28.120 --> 45:31.320
You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code

45:31.320 --> 45:33.080
are gonna crash the world around our ears.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.800
I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed in you.

45:35.800 --> 45:38.760
It turns out that it does exist because this happens.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.440
They were worried people would stop watching

45:40.440 --> 45:42.120
if there was no Moriarty to fight,

45:42.120 --> 45:44.680
and they just killed the other quite well-known villain,

45:44.680 --> 45:46.760
so they had to make sure they implied he was coming back

45:46.760 --> 45:49.240
because if everything doesn't tie into Moriarty,

45:49.240 --> 45:50.920
there's basically no story here.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.680
He doesn't actually come back either.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.840
This turns out to just be, like,

45:54.840 --> 45:56.600
I think this turns out to be a plot hole.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.120
Like, who did this in the end?

45:58.120 --> 45:59.960
Did someone who works for Moriarty do it?

45:59.960 --> 46:03.240
Did he set this up to happen long after his death?

46:03.240 --> 46:04.760
Uh, did Uris do it?

46:04.760 --> 46:07.400
After teasing everyone into thinking he's going to come back

46:07.400 --> 46:09.720
and having an entire special dedicated to figuring out

46:09.720 --> 46:10.840
that, yes, he's dead,

46:10.840 --> 46:13.160
but he must just have some other plans going,

46:13.160 --> 46:15.960
it just keeps turning out to not have anything to do with him,

46:15.960 --> 46:19.160
and the plot continues on as if Moriarty wasn't around.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.160
Then, in the worst episode of all time,

46:21.160 --> 46:22.760
it turns out before he died,

46:22.760 --> 46:24.760
Moriarty met Sherlock's secret sister

46:24.760 --> 46:26.600
and provided video recordings to use

46:26.600 --> 46:29.240
in some bullshit thing she pulls for him for no reason

46:29.240 --> 46:31.880
other than she's crazy.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.160
Woo!

46:33.160 --> 46:34.120
Nice one, Steve.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.600
You got out of having to characterize yet another villain.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.520
At least you didn't make this one gay.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.520
Oh, and at the very end of the show, this happens.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.480
Surprise.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.560
You didn't think I'd just disappear, did you?

46:46.120 --> 46:49.000
Now, provided the show actually gets another season,

46:49.080 --> 46:52.120
baiting people with the return of Moriarty yet again

46:52.120 --> 46:55.320
after all this time establishing he's definitely dead

46:55.320 --> 46:56.920
is absolutely taking the piss,

46:56.920 --> 46:59.560
and I don't even want to know about a prospective season five

46:59.560 --> 47:00.840
or what that would look like

47:00.840 --> 47:04.280
because I have no idea how the show could possibly get any worse,

47:04.280 --> 47:05.720
so instead I'm gonna just move on.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.680
Another thing Sherlock has is a style problem.

47:10.680 --> 47:13.240
It's clear the production crew were given a vastly higher budget

47:13.240 --> 47:15.480
than the majority of British television normally gets,

47:15.480 --> 47:16.600
and you can see why,

47:16.600 --> 47:19.880
except for Doctor Who, QI, British Bake Off, Come Dine With Me,

47:19.880 --> 47:21.480
and The Legacy of Colonialism,

47:21.480 --> 47:24.120
Britain has virtually no remaining cultural exports,

47:24.120 --> 47:27.640
so it makes sense for the BBC to invest heavily in the TV adaptation

47:27.640 --> 47:29.640
of one of our most important cultural icons

47:29.640 --> 47:32.120
so people think we're still relevant as a nation.

47:32.120 --> 47:35.800
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like anyone really knew what to do with that money,

47:35.800 --> 47:39.960
so consequently the show is overproduced to the point where it only gets in the way.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.000
The show is trying at every moment to be the coolest,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.560
most important thing in the entire world,

47:45.560 --> 47:48.120
and it has the time and money to execute on this,

47:48.120 --> 47:50.600
which isn't necessarily a good thing.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.080
The most obvious way this features is the text that comes up

47:53.080 --> 47:55.160
whenever Sherlock's doing his magic mind powers

47:55.160 --> 47:57.000
or whenever someone gets a message on their phone

47:57.000 --> 47:59.240
and appears on screen in a cool visual way.

47:59.240 --> 48:02.120
This makes sense, and so do things like having images be wiped

48:02.120 --> 48:04.520
by people moving through them or doors closing and stuff.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.480
That's just nice editing, and it does help scenes flow together easier.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.080
This is a vast improvement on Jekyll,

48:09.080 --> 48:11.080
which appears to have been rushed and had no budget,

48:11.080 --> 48:13.640
so you get stuff like Hyde's super strength being shown off

48:13.640 --> 48:17.160
by having them just fast-forward footage of James Nesbitt walking normally,

48:17.160 --> 48:18.280
or this shot.

48:28.360 --> 48:31.400
You can see the bones of the style Moffat and the production team of Sherlock

48:31.400 --> 48:33.400
finally get the budget to actually make,

48:33.400 --> 48:34.520
but it just doesn't work.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.080
This is meant to be Hyde drinking a lot of alcohol very quickly

48:37.080 --> 48:40.200
because of his advanced metabolism and unexplained superpowers,

48:40.200 --> 48:42.760
but it just looks like a guy drinking and fast-forward,

48:42.760 --> 48:44.600
and the sound effects just make it silly.

48:44.600 --> 48:47.160
A lot of the special effects in scenes that are meant to be scarier

48:47.160 --> 48:51.160
just dutch angles and shaky cam with undercrank and weird filters.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.400
Sherlock's enhanced budget and scope of production

48:53.400 --> 48:56.920
allows it to pull off versions of this without looking as terrible.

48:56.920 --> 48:58.520
When Sherlock's using his mind powers,

48:58.520 --> 49:00.680
because let's be honest, that's basically what they are,

49:00.680 --> 49:03.720
the soundtrack swells and all kinds of cool sound effects are used

49:03.720 --> 49:05.800
to get across his sheer attentiveness.

49:08.120 --> 49:11.160
Here, for example, because she was scraping the ground with her nails,

49:11.160 --> 49:13.640
as the text appears, you hear a nail-scraping sound.

49:16.520 --> 49:19.160
Giving the text a sound effect as it writes itself in

49:19.160 --> 49:21.560
helps draw your attention to it, make it pop.

49:31.240 --> 49:34.680
They use pen drawing and nose-sniffling noises when he talks about those,

49:34.680 --> 49:37.240
and you can even see they animate the images as it happens.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.840
They do this because they think you're an idiot

49:38.840 --> 49:40.920
and don't understand what writing with a pen means,

49:40.920 --> 49:43.560
so you need both visual and audio cues.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.800
This use of images and sound effects is very effective.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.960
It helps trick the viewer into thinking they're doing more

49:47.960 --> 49:50.120
than watching Benedict Cumberbatch sit in a chair

49:50.120 --> 49:52.040
and tell you about things he's noticed.

49:52.040 --> 49:55.080
In a way, I wouldn't really recommend analyzing this show too much.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.800
I must mention that paying attention to sound and visuals

49:57.800 --> 50:00.680
causes the show's trick to start to wear thin very quickly.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.960
The trousers. They're pretty full.

50:13.960 --> 50:17.560
At its best, you get intense scenes where the level of thinking

50:17.560 --> 50:19.240
being done by Sherlock is highlighted

50:19.240 --> 50:22.600
and you're put into his mind with these extreme close-ups and pauses,

50:22.600 --> 50:25.720
seeing the world how this mega-genius sees it for brief spurts,

50:25.720 --> 50:27.080
and it's all very stylish.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.720
At its worst, this style is a stupid nonsense mess

50:29.720 --> 50:32.120
that ends up being needless or just straight-up silly.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.320
I swear to God, I didn't edit that in!

50:43.320 --> 50:46.360
This tonally dissonant nightmare doesn't put us in Sherlock's mind

50:46.360 --> 50:48.200
and doesn't even show us his trail of thought.

50:48.200 --> 50:52.040
It's just text and images flying past the screen with weird sound effects.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.360
This is the sort of thing I would do for a quick joke,

50:54.360 --> 50:56.440
not the dramatic investigation scene.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.640
Ooh!

50:57.640 --> 50:59.000
You ain't got the...

51:01.480 --> 51:04.920
The show is so dedicated to this amped-up, over-the-top style

51:04.920 --> 51:07.960
that it applies it to places that are incredibly poorly served by it.

51:07.960 --> 51:09.560
My favorite examples are in this one.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.960
My favorite examples are in the wedding episode.

51:11.960 --> 51:15.400
Firstly, you have this bizarre montage of Sherlock and Watson getting drunk,

51:15.400 --> 51:18.920
set to a fucking atrocious dubstep remix of the show's theme

51:18.920 --> 51:20.520
with a blurry vignette over it

51:20.520 --> 51:22.600
because that's what alcohol does!

51:22.600 --> 51:25.000
Intersected with ultra-fast graphs of their night out,

51:25.000 --> 51:26.760
and you're like, whoa, wait, I didn't even see that!

51:26.760 --> 51:27.400
What? What?

51:27.400 --> 51:31.320
This is the most overproduced pub crawl in the history of television,

51:31.320 --> 51:34.440
but the bestest example ever is earlier in the episode

51:34.440 --> 51:37.160
when you have the wedding photographer taking the gang's pictures.

51:37.240 --> 51:40.840
Okay, three, two, one, cheese!

51:40.840 --> 51:44.520
The music swells, you get this cool time-frozen effect and all that.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.360
This shot was quite difficult to pull off.

51:46.360 --> 51:47.880
I know someone who worked on this episode.

51:47.880 --> 51:50.440
They had to build a giant rig with dozens of DSLRs

51:50.440 --> 51:53.400
all at precise positions and angles and focal distances.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.560
This is a cool technique two of my favorite directors,

51:55.560 --> 51:58.040
the Wachowskis, pioneered for the Matrix.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.920
In theory, this is a nice set of shots, right?

52:00.920 --> 52:03.480
But there's a difference between theory and practice.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.560
What is happening in these shots?

52:05.640 --> 52:07.080
How is the story being furthered?

52:07.080 --> 52:10.840
What action is being exacerbated by executing the scene with this technique?

52:10.840 --> 52:14.760
It's a few, brief, elaborate, expensive shots

52:14.760 --> 52:17.800
of people getting their picture taken at a wedding.

52:17.800 --> 52:21.080
The Wachowskis only used this technique in the most intense moments

52:21.080 --> 52:24.760
of some of the most dramatic and well-edited action scenes in film history,

52:24.760 --> 52:29.480
where a single second decompressed during a life-or-death moment has maximum payoff.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.560
I don't know which Berk saw this scene and thought,

52:31.640 --> 52:32.760
Oh, let's do that!

52:32.760 --> 52:35.400
But for the scene where everyone's standing still.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.480
But whoever they were, they should have been fired.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.200
But I guess, since the writers accidentally wrote an episode

52:40.200 --> 52:43.080
mostly consisting of Sherlock farting about at a wedding,

52:43.080 --> 52:45.800
I guess they decided they had to blow the budget on something.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.960
By golly, I wonder who produced this sho—

52:47.960 --> 52:49.240
Oh.

52:49.240 --> 52:52.120
Is this a purposeful reference to the Matrix?

52:52.120 --> 52:54.040
Like, it wouldn't be the first time they did that.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.960
They did that thing at the beginning with the two pills.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.120
What's the deal with these references?

52:58.920 --> 53:02.680
All right, if you take this pill, you wake up in your bed,

53:02.680 --> 53:06.520
and the Sherlock TV series was never made.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.360
It was all a bad dream.

53:08.360 --> 53:12.040
If you take this pill, you have to watch all of it.

53:12.040 --> 53:12.540
Again.

53:13.080 --> 53:13.800
Oh, cool.

53:13.800 --> 53:14.680
Uh, what do you want in return?

53:14.680 --> 53:16.920
Do I need to, like, suck your dick or something?

53:16.920 --> 53:17.720
What? No, no.

53:17.720 --> 53:20.200
I'm gonna shoot you if you don't take either pill.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.480
But you've gotta take one.

53:21.480 --> 53:22.360
That's all.

53:22.360 --> 53:22.860
Really?

53:23.640 --> 53:26.120
Wow, you just talked yourself out of a sweet deal, mister.

53:26.120 --> 53:26.620
Oh.

53:27.500 --> 53:30.460
Ah, sign me the fuck up, sailor.

53:30.460 --> 53:30.960
Ah.

53:34.220 --> 53:36.700
I forgot where I was going with this bit.

53:36.700 --> 53:37.580
I'm sorry.

53:37.580 --> 53:40.940
This kind of attitude to production can be bad for creativity.

53:40.940 --> 53:45.180
Throwing all the money ever at every scene means you get shots like this getting in the way of the story,

53:45.180 --> 53:48.380
and supposedly tense moments of Sherlock trying to figure something out

53:48.380 --> 53:53.180
are ruined by flinging random images and sound effects at the audience in the name of production value.

53:53.180 --> 53:56.540
This is the one lesson I'd have expected Moffat to have learned by now.

53:56.540 --> 53:58.780
You see, one thing Doctor Who was quite famous for

53:58.780 --> 54:03.180
was shooting for expensive ideas and concepts so often with such tight schedules

54:03.180 --> 54:05.260
that it becomes necessary for there to be episodes

54:05.260 --> 54:07.420
where the main characters don't make too much of an appearance

54:07.420 --> 54:09.900
and there aren't too many effects or expensive props.

54:09.900 --> 54:12.540
Within these constraints, Moffat himself wrote Blink,

54:12.540 --> 54:15.100
one of the most universally loved episodes of the show,

54:15.100 --> 54:19.180
where the Doctor and Martha barely show up and the monsters literally don't even move,

54:19.180 --> 54:23.340
creating some incredibly tense moments out of almost no budget whatsoever,

54:23.340 --> 54:27.260
such as this sphincter-tightening scene of a light starting to flicker

54:27.260 --> 54:30.780
and perhaps the most incredibly engaging piece of drama in the entire show,

54:30.780 --> 54:33.980
where a character's arguing with a pre-recorded message of the Doctor

54:33.980 --> 54:35.740
that knows what they're about to say.

54:35.740 --> 54:38.780
How can you have a copy of the finished transcript? It's still being written.

54:38.780 --> 54:41.180
I told you, I'm a time traveler. I've got it in the future.

54:41.180 --> 54:42.700
Blink won a ton of awards,

54:42.700 --> 54:46.140
and I feel proves with its efficient execution on time and budget constraints

54:46.140 --> 54:48.780
that sometimes limitations can be good for creativity.

54:48.780 --> 54:51.500
I didn't really believe that old aphorism until I saw Sherlock

54:51.500 --> 54:53.580
and realized that if you give people too much money,

54:53.580 --> 54:56.540
they do shit like this instead of tell an engaging story.

54:56.540 --> 54:59.180
This production style leads to characters being underused

54:59.180 --> 55:00.700
because they have so little to do

55:00.700 --> 55:03.900
because the focus is on overproducing the scenes where Sherlock does stuff

55:03.900 --> 55:07.420
and other random bullshit instead of making them a decent addition to the story.

55:07.420 --> 55:10.460
This problem even extends to the second principal character,

55:10.460 --> 55:11.580
John Watson.

55:11.580 --> 55:14.540
Watson sucks and has no purpose in this version of the story.

55:14.540 --> 55:16.220
Mary Watson. No, seriously.

55:16.220 --> 55:18.940
After shooting the baddie at the end of episode one,

55:18.940 --> 55:21.260
Watson has nothing to do and spends most of his time

55:21.260 --> 55:24.220
getting treated like shit by his friend for no reason

55:24.220 --> 55:26.940
and running around next to him while he solves everything.

55:26.940 --> 55:28.940
Watson is the point-of-view character,

55:28.940 --> 55:31.740
the literal narrator for most of the home stories,

55:31.740 --> 55:35.180
and he barely even gets to see plenty of the events of the plot.

55:35.180 --> 55:36.380
What else does he d—

55:36.380 --> 55:39.660
Oh, one time he gets kidnapped and Sherlock has to save him.

55:39.660 --> 55:43.900
Oh, another time he, uh, uh, he gets mysteriously kidnapped and Sherlock has to—

55:43.900 --> 55:47.260
Uh, one time, um, he starts a fire?

55:47.340 --> 55:50.300
Oh, and technically, he's there sometimes while Sherlock figures stuff out.

55:50.300 --> 55:52.620
He's also here for, uh, this fight, I guess.

55:52.620 --> 55:56.140
Oh, and also, there's the time when, uh, he gets kidnapped and Sherlock has to save—

55:56.140 --> 55:59.500
One time, he gets held at gunpoint and Sherlock has—

56:00.140 --> 56:03.660
One time, gets held at gunpoint—

56:06.780 --> 56:09.020
Ah, I just made my ears ring, slapping my face.

56:09.660 --> 56:10.780
Jesus Christ.

56:11.660 --> 56:13.260
Fuck you, Steve.

56:13.260 --> 56:18.380
And oh my God, did you see Watson in the background for this exciting scene?

56:19.500 --> 56:25.020
Literally, the most important thing Watson does in all of season two is watch Sherlock die.

56:25.340 --> 56:31.580
The wedding episode has a bit where Sherlock tells us Watson is a good doctor and a really helpful ally and provides anecdotes of times

56:31.580 --> 56:33.420
he did stuff useful to a case.

56:33.420 --> 56:38.460
Wouldn't it have been great if Watson's skills had come in handy in the episodes of the show that were actually made?

56:38.860 --> 56:41.260
And not the ones that are his backstory for this wedding?

56:41.420 --> 56:45.740
The guy's a doctor and a war survivor and the POV character for most of the books,

56:45.980 --> 56:49.020
and he's barely even a presence at his own fucking wedding,

56:49.480 --> 56:52.780
dedicated to Sherlock's hour-long speech supposedly about him,

56:53.020 --> 56:56.940
but really about how smart Sherlock is for figuring out a crime during a speech.

56:57.260 --> 56:58.140
Fuck off.

56:58.140 --> 56:59.100
Mary Watson.

56:59.100 --> 57:02.540
John's wife is a minor character in some of the books and not super important,

57:02.700 --> 57:05.420
but his relationship with his wife does come up in interesting ways,

57:05.580 --> 57:10.220
usually in order to make points about the limited roles of women in British society in the time the story was set.

57:10.380 --> 57:15.100
In the show, she just sort of appears between seasons two and three. The episode after that is their wedding,

57:15.260 --> 57:15.980
although don't worry,

57:15.980 --> 57:20.940
we all know who that episode is really about, and then the next episode after that she turns out to be a secret ninja assassin.

57:21.100 --> 57:26.460
Then in the next episode, not counting the special because the bulk of it takes place in Sherlock's imagination and she's not really in it,

57:26.620 --> 57:31.260
she dies. Mary lived a hugely interesting life and it would have made for a pretty cool addition to the story.

57:31.500 --> 57:35.500
Unfortunately, most of it happens in the same place most of the interesting stuff in the show happens.

57:36.060 --> 57:36.940
Off-screen.

57:36.940 --> 57:39.180
Then for some reason, John sees her as a ghost for a bit,

57:39.340 --> 57:44.380
and then she gives the dumbest speech of all time about how mega special Holmes and Watson are, even though Watson doesn't

57:44.620 --> 57:48.060
do anything, and even she had more input on the events of the four episodes

57:48.140 --> 57:50.940
she had the privilege of being alive for. You've got to hand it to Moffat.

57:51.180 --> 57:53.180
He finally created a strong, smart,

57:53.560 --> 57:57.980
interesting female character, and then just when she was getting a chance to really interact with the story,

57:58.140 --> 58:04.460
he fucking kills her to create tension for the real main characters. Sherlock and whoever this guy is, what does he do?

58:04.460 --> 58:06.780
I think he got kidnapped a few times. Nice going, Steve.

58:06.860 --> 58:10.460
You fleshed out an actually clever addition to the main story just to kill her.

58:10.780 --> 58:16.940
Although I can see why that would be necessary. There's only so many important women in the original stories to ruin, aren't there?

58:17.400 --> 58:19.400
Speaking of which.

58:24.620 --> 58:27.420
Okay, this is gonna be a kind of tough one to get into.

58:28.620 --> 58:30.620
You see,

58:30.620 --> 58:32.620
in the pantheon of Sherlock Holmes,

58:33.500 --> 58:39.340
there are some characters who stick out so well because they're so unique or different or well-written

58:39.740 --> 58:43.100
or special for the time period in which the stories were first made

58:44.140 --> 58:48.940
that future adaptations can't help but lavish them with even more attention.

58:49.900 --> 58:55.740
You know, you would expect Moriarty to be made into this giant supervillain because,

58:56.540 --> 59:01.340
you know, even though he was only in two stories, one of them was the one that killed Sherlock Holmes for 10 years.

59:01.500 --> 59:03.500
That's a really good reason to stand out.

59:06.060 --> 59:11.180
Irene Adler makes it into almost every single adaptation there is of Sherlock Holmes,

59:12.060 --> 59:14.060
and she was in one story.

59:14.940 --> 59:16.940
The third one ever.

59:16.940 --> 59:18.940
A scandal in Bohemia.

59:19.100 --> 59:24.940
Sherlock is approached by the king of Bohemia who is about to get married to a princess and consolidate a shit-ton of land and power,

59:25.020 --> 59:30.540
but five years ago he had a love affair with a controversial opera singer called Irene Adler and sent her love letters and a

59:30.680 --> 59:37.180
compromising photo. The original dick pic. And since the background of the picture clearly shows his My Little Pony collection,

59:37.420 --> 59:41.980
he's worried Adler will email it to his in-laws and the wedding will be called off and he'll lose out on a sweet deal.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.000
Her majesty has certainly committed an indiscretion.

59:46.620 --> 59:52.780
The king offers Sherlock basically infinite money if he can get that stuff back because none of his people have any idea where it's hidden.

59:53.020 --> 59:58.140
So you have a story in which Sherlock is covering up for a king's actions by stealing from an innocent woman

59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.380
who basically did nothing wrong. Sherlock and the king aren't the good guys here.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.660
Sherlock is dismissive about Adler. Sure, he can outsmart a woman.

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:10.380
He knows what they're like. In disguise, Sherlock tricks Adler into revealing its location.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.300
But when he comes back later to get it, he discovers instead a letter telling him,

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:21.020
Nah, nah, nice try, idiot, and finds she's married out of love for someone and left the country and just wants to move on with her life.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.540
Adler outsmarts Sherlock and gets away with it,

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:29.420
which is more than can ever be said for almost anyone else in the entire series. And moreover,

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.300
she disproves his reductive view of women while she does it.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.540
Sherlock loses and has to learn a lesson from it and the viewer is shown that even the great

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.900
detective is not immune to the biases of the culture he lives in. It's not a feminist story by modern standards,

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.160
but for a story published by a man in the 1890s,

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.780
it makes careful strides in showing that not only are women capable of being as smart as men,

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:53.340
but if we don't get over the preconception that they can't be, they will win every time.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:58.960
Sherlock gains a grudging respect for her, not in a romantic way, but because he appreciates that he's been outsmarted.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.260
What a queen she would have made.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.720
Is it not a pity she was not on my level?

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.660
From what I have seen of the lady, yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your majesty.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.220
In 2012's Scandal in Belgravia,

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.340
Sherlock beats Irene, who, by the way, is sexually attracted to him now,

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:25.420
and also then later he saves her life because she gets captured when she goes on the run.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.180
Oh, and also she's a fucking bisexual kung fu dominatrix now.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.860
That's...

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.860
That's one way of adapting the story. This episode's already been criticized to hell and back.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.580
I'm going to defend a couple of small things about it,

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:43.500
like how Adler defeats Sherlock's over-the-top special effects text-o-vision by simply not wearing anything,

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:49.100
and I like that the show leaves it somewhat ambiguous whether this is because it leaves Sherlock with nothing to easily detect,

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.820
or if it's because he just reacted that badly to seeing a naked woman. Those were the pros.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:59.420
Did you miss them? You might have blinked. The cons include everything else. Firstly, she doesn't beat Sherlock.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:06.060
She loses, and then losing puts her in a bad situation, which, don't worry, Sherlock saves her from. How heroic.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.460
But secondly, Sherlock's heroic now. This is a big deal.

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.780
Scandal was impactful because Sherlock worked for the bad guy, a rich and powerful king trying to tie up loose ends

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.660
so his convenient marriage to someone he clearly didn't really care about could go off as smoothly as possible.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:27.500
Now Adler is directly blackmailing people and also is stealing really important intelligence from the British government.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.860
Sherlock is arguably doing the right thing by getting involved here.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:37.260
The moral ambiguity that the original story's had is being erased in the name of making him always the good guy.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.980
Then it turns out she's working directly with Moriarty, the real bad guy, because, of course,

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.540
everything has to tie into Moriarty now, and basically she's acting on his orders and advice.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.940
I can't take all the credit.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.420
Had a bit of help.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.900
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.420
Yes, he's been in touch. And of course, she loses because of those pesky emotions.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.980
She couldn't help but have feelings for Shirley because he's so dreamy and nice

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.100
and not at all a constant piece of shit in the actual show.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.180
In an adaptation of a story where the character wins using her own wits,

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:16.060
she's told what to do by others and then is beaten and then has to be saved.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:21.980
If the creators of the show were really this disinterested in telling a story using the original traits of Irene Adler,

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:26.380
why even put her in here? Why not come up with a new female character to ruin?

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.220
Oh, no, wait, they do that in season four, don't they?

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.100
Despite, as you can tell, not really liking the show that much,

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:36.060
I was looking forward to this story being adapted because I was hoping for this Sherlock to finally learn

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.860
he wasn't always right about people and be a little bit humbled.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:43.820
But Moffat was too busy being clever, tying everything into the now all-powerful Moriarty and

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:50.860
hashtag modernizing the story by making a woman marrying for love in the 1890s into a dominatrix that he forgot to put in the

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.900
fun core of the story, and we're left with a Sherlock who finishes exactly as he began.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.740
Bored, smart, and the bestest guy ever.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.340
Well, I guess he kind of has a semi-girlfriend now.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.180
That's kind of like character development.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:12.480
Scandal in Belgravia doesn't just fuck up the most important non-protagonist character in the entire canon behind maybe Moriarty.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.700
It also contains the scene.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.260
To me, it is always the scene. You will seldom hear me mention it under any other name.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:29.420
In my eyes, it eclipses and predominates the whole of the series. It's the crown in the crown jewels?

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:37.580
Of the whole sordid affair. The scene combines all the worst aspects of this fucking show and compresses it down into a solid

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.420
diamond of shit.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:45.660
The mystery Sherlock is called in to solve before the Adler thing starts is about a guy who's found dead with seemingly no apparent cause.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:50.300
We're shown nothing, no clues that could possibly leave a keen-eyed viewer with the chance to figure it out.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:55.420
He solves it, but doesn't explain what happened or how he figured it out or why, and just stops bothering with it.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:00.220
Then, in an extravagant and fucking ridiculous scene, him and Adler sci-fi

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:05.340
imaginate their way through a scene neither of them have actually been to, and Irene discovers that...

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.540
a fucking boomerang did it.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.540
A boomerang.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.540
Boomerang.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.540
Boomerang.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.540
Boomerang.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.540
Boomerang.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.540
Boomerang.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.540
Boomerang.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.540
Boomerang.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.500
Elementary, my dear Watson.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.940
We've talked before about times where the show has pulled something out of its ass,

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:37.280
but this fucking scene puts them all to rest. Based on nothing, based on no clues we've been given whatsoever,

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:44.700
Sherlock leads Irene to the conclusion that a boomerang did it, and the show presents this as Sherlock being a massive super mega genius.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:50.620
We get shots of Adler making googly eyes at him because she's so attracted to him now that she knows he successfully solved the stupidest

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.780
written scene in television history.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:58.220
The epic soundtrack swells, and everyone wishes they were being killed by a fucking boomerang.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:04.380
The key to mystery stories, the white, hot, burning core of the genre that makes it what it is,

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:09.100
is being given information just enough that you could maybe figure out what was happening,

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:13.660
and then having a character show you something about the information you managed to miss, or

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.220
put the pieces together in a way you wouldn't expect.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:23.260
But to make sure you can't possibly solve it before Sherlock does, because he's supposed to be the most amazing special boy in the world,

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.840
they can't risk giving you too much information.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.740
So they craft a story in which you're shown basically nothing, and then told,

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:36.380
Bing! It's a legendary serial killer I just made up. Bing! Someone else told me the answer off screen. Bing!

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.980
It was a fucking boomerang! The audience will never really accept

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.940
Sherlock as smart, because they're never given the pieces for themselves, and then presented with a solution

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:50.380
they wouldn't have thought of. Instead, they're told next to nothing, and then Sherlock walks in with the information

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.760
you didn't have, or does something unbelievably unrealistic.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.700
You got that from one look?

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.420
Definitely the new sexy.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:06.300
The show is edited as if you're supposed to, like Adler, be completely in awe of this genius, but that's never gonna happen.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:11.980
Contrast is required. This is precisely why puzzles are fascinating in the first place. There's a tangible,

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.560
emotional reaction to figuring out how to solve something, and putting something together.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:22.140
Similarly, for a mystery story to work, you have to be shown the problem and the clues before it's solved,

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:26.300
so you have a chance to do it yourself, and then marvel at seeing someone else find the solution.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:31.900
You're entertained by seeing someone else solve a puzzle you can't, because you recognize they've seen something you haven't.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.660
Sherlock gives you a meaningless glimpse of a trivial piece of the puzzle,

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.340
then produces the finished puzzle, and tells you it was very hard, I promise.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:45.420
In this show, the viewer's never given a chance to observe, so there's nothing for Sherlock to reveal he observed.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.980
So you're left with an incredibly expensive sequence of elaborate camera tricks shot on an Arri Alexa,

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:55.900
featuring a man telling you he's very smart, because he observed events you never got the chance to observe better than you.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.140
Look at all these hard-working people,

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:01.820
dragging their camera rigs all the way out here so they can film a smooth transition,

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:07.420
laying all their dolly tracks, and looking a couch all the way out there, and carefully planning and timing dozens of shots,

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:13.340
doing excellent professional work, and it's all in service to a mystery story where you're not told anything,

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.300
so you're not engaged with it at all, and then at the end,

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:21.340
you're told a fucking bullshit explanation that you could not have seen coming, and he was really smart.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.620
You just have to trust me. Why is the camera spinning so much?

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:29.820
Is it to make this revelation feel more dramatic, or is it to simulate the spinning of a boomerang?

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.060
Do boomerangs even spin?

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.340
Is that why they did this?

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:39.980
Fittingly, this scene keeps coming back in my nightmares to taunt me with how stupid it is.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:43.340
This scene is so bad,

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:50.380
it almost makes you forget that the final scene of this episode is Sherlock single-handedly fighting Al-Qaeda with a machete.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.820
I half expected the boomerang to come back and take a couple of guys out for him.

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.700
Credit where credit is due,

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:01.740
there's still a lot to like about the Sherlock Show, at least to begin with. For all its massive flaws,

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.860
it's still very good at making you think it's going to get better,

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:09.260
and there are plenty of decent moments and fun bits that make you keep watching just to see,

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:15.020
just to see if it can start having more of them and maybe go somewhere with all the plots it has going. Season 4

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:21.020
destroyed that illusion. Let me explain in a roundabout way first. When I was doing research for this video,

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:27.020
I stumbled upon a bunch of theories about Season 4. The usual Sherlock stuff explaining how secretly gay the main characters are,

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.220
but the one that really caught my eye was the Lost Special Theory.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:36.460
You see, for some Sherlock fans, the fact the show is bad is just a minor hitch in the grand scheme of the amazing

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.940
metanarrative of Moffat's mythic reimagining of Sherlock as a magical pretty boy.

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:48.700
Thus, the horrific badness and plot holes of Season 4 are just more data to incorporate into a running theory about what's really going on.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:54.700
The conclusion quite a lot of people reached was that the last episodes of Sherlock couldn't possibly be as bad as they were.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:02.540
Instead, it's a fake-out, a build-up to a secret, unannounced fourth episode of Season 4 in which everything is really explained.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:09.180
The garbage from the previous eight, sorry, three episodes is revealed to be a hallucination or a play or a dream sequence,

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.460
and the show finally turns out to have always been good.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:18.860
The main focal point of the theory was a show supposedly starting just after the end of Sherlock called Appletree Yard.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:25.120
The theory is that Appletree Yard is a codename, and in reality, it's when the fourth Sherlock airs and all is revealed.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:30.460
The proof? The show's website's German language version or something is a 404 page.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.540
404.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.260
Get it? Season 4? Episode 4?

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.420
Oh my god, even the inventor of HTTP's error messages is in on it.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.500
And if that wasn't enough to prove it, the lead actress's name is Emily Watson.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.900
Watson.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.500
Watson. And if that's not enough to convince you, and I certainly hope it isn't,

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.740
there's plenty more evidence coming your way. At one point in the show, Sherlock says,

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:58.460
We found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.860
All your possessions were searched.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:06.280
Speaking of something comforting about the number three, people always give up after three.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.180
See?

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.180
Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:10.940
The Appletree.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:15.820
Clowns, magpies, and fish, none of which go together whatsoever aesthetically.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.540
But all of which has intricate symbolic meaning.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.540
Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.300
And in this promotional image for the series, Mark Gatiss is holding up four fingers. See?

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.300
Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.940
Oh, wait, that might have just been because it's the fourth season.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:35.980
But you can see how the crushing weight of all this evidence caused me to hold off on working on this video for a while.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.380
Just in case it turned out that there really was going to be another one.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:45.820
Just in case Appletree Yard was fake, and Moffat was really a secret genius,

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:50.300
only pretending to be a bad showrunner this entire time, and then Appletree Yard aired.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:56.220
And guess what? You'll never believe it, but it turns out it was an adaptation of Appletree Yard,

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.660
starring Emily Watson, which is just her name, because some people are called Watson.

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.700
The hashtag on Twitter for Appletree Yard when it aired was,

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:10.300
5% people interested in this new show or an adaptation of a book they quite liked, and 95%

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:17.180
pissed Sherlock fans, waiting to see when Sherlock would show up and retroactively justified the bad show he was in.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.580
It didn't happen, and the fan theory people were mostly apologetic about getting everyone's hopes up, or

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:26.940
annoyed that it turned out their show had always been bad, and had just tricked them into thinking it would be with flashy,

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.500
overproduced, bullet-time wedding photos.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.500
I wouldn't write this if I wouldn't be utterly convinced that this is going to happen.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:39.260
Johnlock is endgame. The series isn't finished yet, and I'm going to tell you why.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:45.500
Because it doesn't make sense. I want to remind you that these people have been producing Sherlock for seven years now.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:51.420
Seven years. They put hard work into it, told us again and again that every little detail matters.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:58.460
Do you truly believe anyone on the show, including the producers, the cast, etc., would all suddenly lose their minds overnight?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.700
Overnight? I mean, it's possible.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:06.300
I can't even tell you which night it was. The one right before Moffat decided to adapt Sherlock Holmes.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.260
I've never actually thought Apple Tree Yard was a completely fake show,

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:15.120
so literally all this does is defer my questions. Why was the final problem badly written on purpose?

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:24.060
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to tell you this, but it wasn't bad on purpose.

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.940
They were trying to make a good show and failed, and even if it's bad on purpose,

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.780
that still just means the show's bad. A secret fourth episode

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:39.900
still wouldn't be a get-out-of-jail-free card for wasting your goddamn time, and more importantly, mine.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.380
But since the secret lost episode never came to fruition because it doesn't exist,

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:50.700
I can finally conclude that I have, in fact, seen all of season four of Sherlock and can therefore weigh in on it.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.420
It's really bad.

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:59.180
So bad that people who wanted to like the show had to invent a secret good episode that would, if it existed,

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:04.060
somehow fix it. It's orders of magnitude worse than the rest of the show,

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:09.180
and I'm pretty sure I've established that's already pretty bad. But what's bad about it goes fairly deep.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:15.660
It's not just that it's worse written, the characters are facsimiles of themselves, and the driving thrust of the story is utterly fallen apart.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.620
It's that ultimately it trips on the curtain and tears away all the flaws of the entire show from front to back,

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:25.020
revealing it to have always been the worst, like a car that looks like a shambles,

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.520
but at least convincingly seems to be headed in the right direction,

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:32.460
until it collides with a brick wall and turns out to have been a doomed journey from the very start.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.820
So after the special in which Sherlock imaginary solves a crime

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.340
he knows very little about and he figures out that Moriarty's definitely dead,

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:45.820
so the game-changing twist of two years ago was once again fake fucking bullshit nonsense designed to trick you into thinking the show was going

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:51.900
to get interesting. The implication was that Moriarty had some kind of plan designed to be executed after his death in order to, what,

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.500
taunt Sherlock?

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.660
Gain power he doesn't need because he's dead?

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.260
Destroy the world or just mess with people for the fun of it?

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.780
Who knows?

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:04.620
I don't, because Moriarty doesn't figure at all into the actual plot of season four.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:10.460
The special also ends by implying something interesting is going to happen, with Sherlock striding off saying that he knows what Moriarty's people are

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.580
going to do next.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.580
I know exactly what he's going to do next.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:19.820
The episode begins with Sherlock revealing he has no idea and he's just going to wait and see what happens next and react to it.

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.180
We brought you back to deal with this. What are you going to do? Wait.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.180
So it's a setup for nothing.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:29.580
This is something a series has always done by ending implying something interesting is about to happen next and then

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:34.220
it doesn't, but this series is especially fucking egregious about this.

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:39.260
Instead Sherlock happens to notice a Thatcher statue broken and becomes fixated upon it

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:44.940
and somehow becomes certain the remains of Moriarty's network want a pearl that might be hidden in the last Thatcher statue.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.580
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.020
I can't stand it. Never can.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.780
I have the strangest feeling.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.220
It is me.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:57.180
But then it turns out no, it's a completely unrelated series of events revolving around Watson's wife again.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:03.020
By the way, this is the exact bullshit twist they pulled in the previous episode where it turns out it's about Mary.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.540
It's hard to explain just how much whiplash there is in this season.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:11.260
The case in point with this one is that you spend the whole time waiting on a reveal that Sherlock really was onto something

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:15.900
and then actually he's onto something completely different we also had no way of seeing coming.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.780
So then Mary goes undercover to try and hide so she can't be found by the other cool assassin guy

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.020
and basically chooses random numbers

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:27.900
so she's untraceable with this long montage showing just how hiding-y she's being and wow,

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:31.820
she's incredibly super off the grid. We get it. And then bam, Sherlock's there.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.260
How did you find me?

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.620
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:43.420
Really though, how? Every movement I made was entirely random. Every new personality just on the roll of a dice.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.580
Once again, here's one of the key sorts of question begged by Sherlock Holmes stories.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.580
How did he solve the puzzle and figure it out?

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:52.300
What sort of genius application of reason will make you go

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:59.980
ah and feel like an idiot and marvel before the simplicity of it? The show recognizes that these questions are the point of Sherlock.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:05.340
Mary, no human action is ever truly random and I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine the seemingly

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.840
infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.740
But they're really difficult so instead I just stuck a trace on the inside of the memory stick.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.740
But instead of giving a useful answer we get this bullshit fake explanation that turns out to be fake

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:24.460
and actually he just put a tracking device in the USB pen that she took from him.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:30.220
This is played for a joke, but it's not a comedy fun time jokey joke to laugh at for comedy hijinks.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:35.980
It's a joke at the expense of the audience for even wanting to know how Sherlock did something.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:41.100
Sherlock finds Mary and fuck you if you hoped for or expected something clever.

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:46.860
Then the assassin she's hiding from turns up because of course he was tracking Sherlock who knew he would track Mary.

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:51.660
So we have this mega genius who knew to plant a tracking device before Mary could drug him and take the device

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.740
but somehow isn't smart enough to A.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:58.540
Detect Mary was going to drug him and maybe stop her or talk her into working with him.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:03.740
B. React at all in a productive manner the way he did when he had a 10 minute sequence dedicated to

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.900
how he reacted in the five seconds of consciousness he had as he passed out from being shot

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:14.460
by Mary who at this point he maybe should be capable of anticipating attacks from or C.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:19.820
Notice he was being tracked himself or even think to consider he might be tracked by the assassin

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:25.900
He'd met before and who knew who he was. So if everyone successfully tracks everyone to the same place and they fight

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:31.500
Anyway, what was the point in writing it? So that this happens like this adds nothing to the actual story

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:37.500
It's all a setup for this big fucking joke about how cool Sherlock is which we've been told enough by now

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.180
This is yet more time that could have been spent telling a story

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.300
It's a farce

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.460
But it's rendered tragic by just how good Sherlock Holmes stories and adaptations can be

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:54.140
Sherlock Holmes and the Pearl of Death adapted the same story fairly excellently by having clearly delineable themes about the power of money and greed

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.660
And fear and having the MacGuffin actually just be a nice pearl lots of people wanted

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:05.020
The pearl has been unobtainable across history because no group endeavor to find it has ever gone without

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:11.260
Internal tensions all vying to take it for themselves. They always end up all killing each other and dying and leaving it lost again

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.300
It stands for a deeper problem with the human soul

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:21.020
All Sherlock's moves are understandable or explained in retrospect when the time comes with a nice reveal or

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:26.780
Justified by reasoning that you could have noticed at the time and then maybe Sherlock reveals it and you go

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:33.600
Ah, of course, it's a delightful romp where the story makes goddamn sense and real themes are explored

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:39.520
No more than a symbol of the greed and cruelty and lust for power that have set men at each other's throats down through the centuries

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.920
The struggle will go on Watson for a pearl

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.720
Kingdom

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.360
Perhaps even world dominion

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.440
To the greed and cruelty of burned out of every last one of us

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.520
When that time comes

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.680
Perhaps even the pearl

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.480
Will be washed clean again

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.760
It's

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:12.480
A good adaptation because it understands what was good about the original story and plays off it

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.740
It doesn't do it for the first like

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:23.840
Maybe 30 minutes and then it actually becomes as fucking stupid spy thing that once again is all about Mary in this story

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.280
The killer is trying to kill Mary because he misunderstood a conversation

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.320
Some torturers were having and assumed they were talking about Mary and therefore sought revenge for years and years and years

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.720
The entire plot of this episode revolves around mishearing someone it's

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.840
Literally the plot of the second half of Shrek

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:47.240
but with some superficial aspects of the basic plot of the six Napoleons draped across it for the simple reason of

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.200
Resembling a real Sherlock Holmes story. What are the themes? What's the story about?

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.660
How does Sherlock happen to stumble upon the one crime being committed right that moment that happens to directly concern Mary Watson?

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:07.140
Presumably because of magic Sherlock's so smart that he saw something and figured it out without even knowing he'd done it

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:10.780
Because at this point that's how fucking bullshit the show is and yes

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:16.980
Sometimes that is the justification for things he notices. You could attenuate to every strand of quivering data

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:23.880
The future would be entirely calculable. I figured it out because I'm attuned to every data point

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.500
Well, that's really fucking convenient, isn't it?

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.900
It saves you having to write a story that people have to follow

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:35.660
Oh, no, it doesn't because those are the people who watch it. This has to be entertaining for us to watch Steve

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:41.600
Did you did you forget that the closest this episode has to a theme is this was a mistake?

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:45.420
This never should have gotten this far. Thank God. It's the last season

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:49.340
The show is so self-aware that killing off Mary Watson is a bad idea

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.020
That she's actually still in the other two episodes

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.740
Like she's a ghost for some of the second one and she appears on DVDs and then in the third one

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.600
She she's another one that she knew to send

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:06.500
Afterwards the second DVD by the way who uses DVDs anymore

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:11.020
She of all people should know that USB pens are the way forward

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.540
Hey, remember the plot of Sherlock the story's twists undercut itself by trying to have you know

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.260
An interesting story that ties together well

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.780
But then having Moriarty turn out to have nothing to do with it all or having Sherlock successfully track Mary only

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:28.300
It's just a tracking device or having the assassin be trying to kill Mary for something from her dark past except it turns out

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:34.060
She did nothing wrong this endless twisting and untwisting runs through season 4 to such a degree that you can never be certain of anything

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.780
And this makes you unable to give a shit about any of it

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:43.300
Also, this is the second time now in two seasons or two slash three episodes depending how you count it the Sherlock completely

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.460
Coincidentally stumbled into a story that directly concerns Mary while trying to do something else

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.500
Would it really have been that hard to tie things together?

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:57.620
Case in point with the twisting and untwisting you have Mary have this dark past right like her whole thing is she used to do

01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.380
Some bad stuff. So then when someone from her dark past is looking for a seeking revenge. You're like, oh

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:08.060
This is the comeuppance for that. This is an interesting thing to explore. But then it's like now she didn't do anything wrong

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.660
she was fine, she was actually his friend she was good all the time and

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.180
He's mistaken

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:17.800
So I guess that's fucked the villain of episode 2 is Culverton Smith

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.820
There's no evidence that he's a criminal

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:26.980
But you begin the episode knowing he's a bad guy because his daughter says to Sherlock that she remembers him

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.580
Saying he's a murderer. So we already have his confession

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:37.540
Then it twists and says our she was fake. But then within about five minutes it untwists because he did do it. So

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:45.380
Again was the fucking point and then it turns out that he didn't hallucinate that woman. She was actually his secret sister in disguise. Oh

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:48.340
Fuck they actually wrote that that wasn't

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:50.540
Jesus fucking Christ

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:56.420
One thing they could have immediately done to improve this season is have the untwist not happen

01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:58.740
Like have the guy who's trying to get revenge on Mary

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:06.820
Actually have justifiable reasons for trying to kill her like maybe she did betray him or maybe have Sherlock

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.900
actually hallucinate a

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:16.680
Confession and Culverton Smith is innocent have an episode dedicated to Sherlock's actual breakdown instead of him obviously faking it

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:23.180
Which it's obvious because you already know he's bad because even after it turns out that

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.580
He hasn't actually met his daughter before

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:30.620
Within like a couple of minutes there. He is saying nah now you're right

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.780
I'm the bad guy, but no instead they always make sure that the characters are a hundred percent, right?

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.580
Mary never betrayed anyone and was very reliable and

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:45.060
Sherlock did not hallucinate and it was all pretend and he was right all along even though a couple things turned out to be

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:50.100
Not what he thought they were and it's just oh well fuck off then the characters aren't really being challenged

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:54.180
We were told that Sherlock was right in the first five minutes, and it turned out to be right so

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.520
What was the point of the last hour and 25 minutes?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.380
They never explain of course how Sherlock's sister figured out that Culverton Smith was a villain because you just have to assume

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.180
She's a super genius who figured out with magic. Why did any of this happen?

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.980
Why did his sister pretend to be Culverton Smith's daughter in order to make Sherlock catch him?

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:17.260
Why did she pretend to be Watson's therapist? Why did she flirt with Watson in disguise?

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.100
making funny face

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.100
I think I'll put a hole in it

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.260
Why does she say I'll put a hole in his head and then it turns out she just tranquilized him

01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:38.240
Why does she do anything well because like Moriarty she wants to test Sherlock or play with him or just

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:44.440
You know mess with his head or something just because why is she doing it now?

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:52.220
But everything is compounded in the final episode an episode so bad that even the show's greatest fans

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:57.940
Wish it was fake just to set up how fucking bullshit this episode is

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:04.500
Let me explain the opening in detail a girl wakes up on a plane everyone else on it is out cold or dead

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:10.100
She looks around her. There's no one to help. She's in trouble a phone rings, and she hears Moriarty

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:25.660
This is a fairly okay set up isn't it by the end of this episode Moriarty is still dead it turns out

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.800
That's just a recording

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.140
but also it isn't even a recording and isn't playing to anyone because none of this is happening because it's all just a fantasy story

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:39.940
By Sherlock's sister that she's making up and telling Sherlock perhaps the only thing sadder than the lost special theorists are the people who are like

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.140
Oh, no, there's loads of really deep stuff going on in the background

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:48.020
Let me explain to you how it's secretly very smart so like a plane full of dead people

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:52.660
except one girl with zero clues suggesting that the adults may be

01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.780
Inhaled or ingested something that the girl didn't or any

01:26:56.180 --> 01:27:00.940
Explanations for how this plane could stay airborne for several hours with no one flying it

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:07.780
I don't think we were ever meant to interpret this literally the show wanted us to doubt the authenticity of all this see they

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:13.980
Certainly imply. This is a fake story by having there be hints in the form of the story being so ridiculous. It's impossible to believe

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:21.820
Listen I hate to burst your bubble, but those aren't really hints at all. This is the sort of crazy stupid bullshit

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:27.300
We've been expected to believe over the course of this entire fucking show in one episode

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:31.220
It turned out a boomerang did it and in that same episode?

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:39.180
Mycroft's plan literally involved making an entire plane full of dead people this literally fucking happened in the fucking show

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:43.940
And suddenly we're supposed to cotton on to how unrealistic it is now

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.060
Fuck off

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.620
Fuck off

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.620
Stop it, please stop trying to trick people into thinking this bullshit was smart

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:58.580
Please the show opens with a relatively interesting setup and it concludes by telling you it made all of it up

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:04.100
And it's a lie, and that's the running theme of this episode nay this season nay this entire show

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:09.420
Relatively clever setups that imply something cool is gonna happen, and then it's fucking

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.260
Undoes itself

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:17.340
Mycroft is chased around by a fucking clown and his pictures start to bleed out of the eyes and you're like oh fuck

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:21.300
What the hell is happening? Oh, it's just Sherlock messing with him. Oh, okay?

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:27.060
Oh, well Sherlock's on the trail of Moriarty's secret gang trying to find oh no

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:32.820
It's not oh my god a DVD with a message on it. This might be the final message from Moriarty. No. It's not oh my god

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.180
Sherlock actually hallucinated a confession, and he actually has a problem no no holy shit

01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:42.020
Did Mary betray her oldest friends and comrades no don't worry? She didn't know it's fine

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.940
How Holmes and Watson gonna get out of that he walks out he walks out holy shit

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:53.020
Who's this fucking shady guy who just abducted Watson? Oh, it's his brother and everything's fine doesn't matter who cares holy shit

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:56.820
They just fucking killed off Sherlock. How are they good? Oh? He's fine. Oh all right?

01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:02.180
Oh my god Moriarty's back, and he's got some cool plan and he can hack all the things in London. No he can't

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.180
He's not even in this story

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.100
What makes season four in particular so disliked by fans

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:14.860
Isn't that it's that much worse than the rest of the show although it is it's that at this point people are starting to realize

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.100
That all these setups will have no payoff

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:20.140
Anyway back to the episode at hand Sherlock

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.820
Mycroft and Eurus Holmes are all super geniuses right

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:29.380
Eurus is set up to be so amazingly mega smart even as a kid that she got too smart and became a psycho murderer that

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:36.940
Sherlock forgot about because it was too traumatic the final episode is guess what season 1 episode 3 again with Eurus taking the place

01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:39.420
Of Moriarty who it turns out she learned about

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:46.500
somehow and asked to meet five years ago and got recordings of for this test that she planned years in advance and also possibly

01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.820
Programmed Moriarty to want to play with Sherlock herself all those years ago

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:54.460
But you'll never really know because the writers seemingly neither know nor care

01:29:54.500 --> 01:30:00.340
There are plenty of plot holes in this episode for how a character knew something or how they knew something could possibly have happened years

01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.860
In advance or any of the choices that they made

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.260
But at this point the writers can write it off with well

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:11.740
They're geniuses and they're attuned to every data point and they know everything and they're so much smarter than you the viewer

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:18.580
Making the characters this amazingly intelligent gives the writers a get-out-of-jail-free card from having to justify or explain

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:24.860
Anything in a tangible way that a normal person could follow and the answer is fuck you

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:31.420
They're smart the episode ends with the revelation that Sherlock has yet another blocked person in his memory a double secret person

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.460
he extra forgot a

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:40.460
Childhood friend who he remembers as a dog. One of the things that characterizes the home stories is that we know

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:43.260
Virtually nothing about Sherlock Holmes

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:50.540
and I'm curious if Benedict and Stephen and Mark Gatiss spent any time on the backstory of

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.500
Sherlock and Mycroft and their antecedents

01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:59.540
No, I don't think you know a character by creating a backstory for them

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:04.620
We sometimes speculate because we're interested in you chat about it what his parents were like what he did

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:10.220
But you know what? We're not it's it's sacred turf. You don't you don't mess that up

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.660
You don't you don't bring that into the show. It's not right

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:15.940
There are some things we don't know about Sherlock Holmes

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:20.900
Just as there are some things we don't know about our friends and we don't ever know them and then that's right and proper

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:24.060
I think if we went and did something like in a way the audience wouldn't believe it

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.980
It's a now you've made that bit up. Okay, I'm gonna be honest here

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:33.900
I was just looking through old interview footage to find b-roll to use for a later section where I talk more about Moffat and

01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:42.140
Accidentally stumbled upon this smoking gun where Moffat's like if we decide to stop and get into Sherlock's backstory

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:49.900
Maybe we're doing something wrong. This interview did not age well and also Eurus made up the girl on the plane

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:54.900
He was trying to save the whole episode and then Sherlock hugs her because at this point

01:31:54.900 --> 01:32:01.020
It's easier than figuring out what she actually wants or why she did it and plays of the violin until she's happy

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:02.980
the end

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:07.540
It's actually pretty believable that fans who stuck with this episode all the way through would assume

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:10.180
This episode was some kind of fake trick

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:16.220
This season is so bad killing off the most interesting addition to the story so far adding in not one

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:22.540
But two secret forgotten people constantly parading Moriarty around as if he's just on the fringes about to come back

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:27.220
But actually he's basically not in it at all that basically everyone thinks it's utter shite

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:31.380
The saddest thing is even though I could talk the longest about the problems of season 4

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.220
Nobody needs me to tell them that season 4 is bad. You know the first three seasons

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:41.540
they're only really bad if you care about the Sherlock mythos or are paying attention or want a compelling story or

01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:48.060
like to think about things, you know, you can turn your brain off and have a pretty fun time watching Benedict Cumberbatch and

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.060
It's Martin McBacon

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.900
talk about the stuff they're doing and

01:32:55.060 --> 01:33:01.180
Watch the camera spin season 4 is so bad that you don't need to perform any analysis whatsoever to recognize how shite it is

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:08.180
So I'm basically out of a job. Like I said, the backlash isn't just a reaction to this season though. It's more than that

01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:10.300
It's a reaction to the deeper

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:16.540
Realization this season brings about the entire show if there's one thing this show was always good at one thing Moffat as a writer

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:21.900
Always did it's keep you thinking an explanation was coming that the show was going to get good

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:26.820
The main way he does this is with cliffhangers and endings that suddenly imply more is going on

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:32.780
The show's bread-and-butter is revealed to have always been implying the show is about to turn out to be deep

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:40.300
Implying characterization and backstory that's way more interesting than what ends up on the screen after four seasons and a special of implying

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:46.580
People started to realize they were being played the drug of this manipulative writing style started to wear off

01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:51.060
Fans of the series have been pretty rough on season 4 and while it deserves all of it

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.340
The preceding show deserved a lot of it too

01:33:53.340 --> 01:34:00.140
But because they hadn't yet realized they were being played people thought those ones were better. Well, sorry go back and check

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:04.420
This is why I brought up the secret good fourth Sherlock episode theory

01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:10.820
Because the show has rung a dozen hours of content out of telling you the audience all about future good episodes

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:16.020
But you don't actually get to see instead of giving you any the fans who want that new episode

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:20.380
Simply take more seriously than anyone else the promise they were made by this show

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:25.060
Which by the way is increasingly difficult to do because of the show's very clear

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:29.900
Attitude to the people who want to think about it if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes stories

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:34.780
Stephen Moffat and his co-writers hate you if you're a fan of Sherlock the show

01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:39.820
Moffat wants you dead if you actually want to understand what is happening in the story

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.900
Stephen Moffat calls you a stupid piece of shit

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:47.180
Repeatedly in the show this hatred doesn't just manifest in

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:53.380
Insulting wankery like having it turn out to be a fucking boomerang or in deliberately rewriting one of the first

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:59.100
Proto-feminist icons in crime fiction to be a sexy kung-fu dominatrix in love with the main character

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:04.900
But in how the show directly tells you that if you're a fan, you should personally go and fuck yourself

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:09.080
When they reveal a couple of minutes after killing him that Sherlock's still alive

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:15.540
They purposefully don't explain how he survived so that people could speculate about it for the years leading into season 3

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.300
But guess what?

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.660
They never explain it

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.220
in fact

01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:25.100
season 3 features several characters whose sole job is to portray fan theories and theorists and make fun of them and call them stupid for

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:30.500
Bothering to try and figure out what happened based on the information given to them by the show now

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:34.300
I just want to be clear on something a lot of the theories about how Sherlock survived were dumb

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:38.940
Not as dumb as the secret good extra season 4 episode theory, but dumb

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:43.060
However, the people coming up with these elaborate theories are the true fans of the show

01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:50.740
They're the real audience the people who care enough to push through the stupid plotting and lack of real mysteries because Sherlock solves them with magic

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.740
To actually try and piece things together

01:35:53.100 --> 01:36:00.300
People trying to figure out the mystery of the mystery story are presented as a little club of weirdos being weird together

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:06.300
the creator of the story appears to be so fundamentally incapable of recognizing how to tell a

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:10.580
Mystery that he's perceived people treating it like one as insane

01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:17.300
They even have one of the perspective theories be that Holmes and Moriarty were gay lovers who faked it together and even the other

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:19.180
Theorists make fun of her for that

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:23.660
even though the same people writing this scene to make fun of that are also the people who

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:29.460
Purposefully queer baited the fuck out of the relationships between Holmes and Watson and Holmes and Moriarty

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:35.060
They spend a huge chunk of this episode literally calling people stupid for reading into the story's clear

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:40.900
Intentional subtext instead of you know, writing better text first off

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:45.820
I want to say give a shout out to all of my UK tumblr friends for staying up very late to watch this right now

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.300
um

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:56.140
The episode resolves with the main theorist played by a Lindybeige impersonator being told by Sherlock what he actually did

01:36:56.180 --> 01:37:02.900
But then maybe it turns out Sherlock isn't there and he's losing his mind and the last we see of this character is him laughing

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:08.100
Maniacally with his conspiracy theory wall like a loser. Did you want to know how Sherlock did the thing?

01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:11.580
Did you expect the story to actually tell you this is you?

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:18.460
Fuck you the actual correct answer that's positioned by John Watson is that you're not supposed to care

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:24.900
I don't care how you faked it Sherlock. I want to know why it doesn't matter how he did it

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:31.320
You should only care about why you're not supposed to care how a thing happened in a fucking

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:33.740
fucking crime

01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:35.700
mystery story

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:40.740
Literally a fucking series of books about figuring out how things happen

01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.740
and

01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:49.940
This shit this shit like with the boomerang scene or the I did a bunch of stuff

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:54.920
You don't know about scene is a blatant disregard for the core appeal of crime

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.840
mystery stories heck stories

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:05.300
It's so disgustingly wrong on almost every level and so hateful towards people for expecting things to make sense

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:09.420
And trying to form a theory out of what they were shown that it's almost avant-garde

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.660
Instead of bothering to use the couple of hours they get every two years

01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:19.420
They get to tell a compelling story. They're basically calling people who like the show

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:23.820
Stupid for thinking about it that takes balls

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:29.500
Moffat and Gant is a seemingly above the idea of people wanting to solve the mystery

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:37.020
They're being presented with because they're so far up their own asses writing about clever people who just know and you're supposed to accept

01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.660
That as a story

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:44.860
They solve it because they're smart and that's not even getting into the sheer contempt for the source material

01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:50.460
Rewriting one of the most interesting characters in the mythos and one of the few people who ever beats Sherlock

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:55.020
So that she's not interesting because she's just the villain and then doesn't beat him is

01:38:55.700 --> 01:39:01.220
Apocalyptically bad, but it's just a tip of a gigantic iceberg made of frozen

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:03.140
We in the hounds of Baskerville

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:10.180
they're too special to simply have a big dog people are scared of and a local legend being abused so someone can claim an

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.860
Inheritance by offing their relatives

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:20.020
No that world famous story on the UK's best-loved novel list the best Holmes novel ever written as rated by Sherlock fans

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:27.740
Was too dumb and simple and understandable what it really needed was a drug that makes you hallucinate and a secret government research facility and

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:30.300
Pointless intrigue with Sherlock sneaking into a facility

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.020
He could easily have asked his fucking brother to let him into which he does later anyway

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:38.180
And the only reason there's a hound in the story at all is because the word hound

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:42.820
Happened to be written on the killers shirt when he killed a kid's father

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:47.700
So the kid hallucinated a giant dog and yet while they're trying to gussy up this

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.380
Famous story to make it more cleverer with this bullshit

01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:56.660
They don't even bother explaining why the killer didn't just kill the only witness to his fucking crime

01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.660
There's this core mismatch in the sensibility of the story's authors

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:03.620
They don't just hate you for wanting to solve a mystery

01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:11.340
They seemingly hate mystery stories themselves for being too understandable having too many simple pleasures like

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.580
Watching a story unfold

01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:19.140
Moffat and Gatiss decided that shit wouldn't fly anymore and it had to be fixed by over

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:25.940
Complicating it and adding in a secret facility. I wonder if Moffat's made this fucking mistake in an adaptation before

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:30.340
Rache, German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us something. Yes. Thank you for your input

01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:35.780
Find out who Rachel is. She was writing Rachel. No, she was leaving an angry note in German

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.380
Of course she was writing Rachel

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:43.460
Oh, wow, they straight up have Sherlock dismiss the twist from the original story as being stupid and for idiots great

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Thanks

01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:50.980
Listen Steve, I know you're listening because

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:56.540
What else you're gonna be doing with your fucking time now that you're not running Doctor Who and probably not gonna get another season of

01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:02.540
This if you think you're too smart for the simple pulpy crime stories that make up a famous property

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:09.580
You're adapting and you think they need to be fixed. Why are you adapting them in the first place the Sherlock fandom?

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:14.020
the people who make gifts of all the romantic moments between Sherlock and Watson with the

01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:18.660
Saturation slightly raised to make the image pop and also fix the show's own shit

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:24.820
Wank color grading the people who actually believe enough pieces of the puzzle are there to explain how Sherlock survived

01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:30.300
the people who actually liked the show enough to not believe season 4 was as bad as it was and

01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.180
There had to be an episode that explained why it was pretending to be shit

01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:40.460
The only people who will stick with Sherlock all the way through and actually profess to enjoying it are these people

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:46.860
These people fully believe the promise of the show that it really will one day be good and smart and pull back the curtain to

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:50.620
Reveal an amazing true narrative kept hidden all this time that had always been there

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:56.260
It's so easy to make fun of people for coming up with that silly theory. In fact, I've done that and you should too

01:41:56.300 --> 01:42:03.940
It's stupid, but it's honest. It's the truest expression of being told over and over that something was coming. It's gonna get good

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:06.660
There's a real secret thing going on in the background

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.420
All these people did was take that seriously

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:15.220
But in reality, they were simply lied to the reality is a show that keeps telling you

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:21.580
I know it's bad, but I promise eventually it'll get good or turn out to have always been smart after four seasons

01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.420
It's just a bad show

01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:28.340
The old books and serials were designed to keep you reading or watching and coming back for more

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:33.980
When Sherlock went over the Reichenbach Falls with Moriarty and the final problem threatened to live up to its name

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.180
There was a public outcry

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:43.340
people wanted more their appetite fed by the format of the story and love for the character a full decade later still

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:49.500
Hounded pardon the pun by fans of his greatest work who still didn't care that much for his historical novels

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.060
Doyle had no choice

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:58.300
But to have Holmes return the new show kills Sherlock and within a few minutes of mourning him tells you it's okay

01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:03.340
He's fine. No one would clamor for this Sherlock's resurrection a decade later

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:07.260
They had to make sure you knew he wasn't really dead

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:12.700
Because otherwise you wouldn't have given a shit about a next series and would have moved on with your life

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.420
They needed you to be speculating for years about how he did it

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:20.460
Even though later they planned on telling you you were a fucking idiot for doing it

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:24.100
It's been ten years since Jekyll came out and ended on a cliffhanger

01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:28.500
Is anyone hounding Moffat to bring back that beloved story?

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.180
No

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:36.740
It's not beloved Moffat is handing off the running of Doctor Who to someone else and he said in interviews that he wants to simply

01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:39.580
Leave the show better than he found it for someone else to take over

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:45.540
Well, guess what Steve? We'd have all liked if you'd done that too. Doctor Who was a silly weird and

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:52.180
Fantastic show that went off the air in 1989 and people remembered it wanted more of it for so long

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:57.340
To the point that almost 20 years later people wanted the show to return

01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:05.020
Cared about seeing what happened next like Sherlock Holmes before it the creators of Doctor Who crafted a character and series

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:10.740
So good so iconic that not even a long absence could kill the love for what they had made

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:17.220
After a few short years of running Doctor Who even Moffat can't wait to be gone

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:24.340
Moffat will be remembered forever for his contributions to the show when someone else ran it when he was just on the edge making the

01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:28.540
Best bits forced to tell a complete story and deliver on the promises

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:35.000
He was making instead of endlessly delaying the time things get good until people realize it isn't and never will and no

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:40.780
One can tell him what to do because the executive producers are him his co-writer and his mother-in-law

01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:44.820
Many of the previous Holmes adaptations are straightforwardly written and shot

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:49.380
There's a whole lot of flat shots of people talking the camera never turns and reveals

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.440
They actually built a set in the middle of London, and it's a dream sequence

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:57.180
But I would rather watch Sherlock figure things out by sitting and looking at things

01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:01.460
We also see and deriving a better explanation than I could with the same information

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:06.700
Any day of the week then sit through another second of self-indulgent look at me

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.420
I'm so clever spinny camera nonsense that reveals

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:14.620
It was probably just a fucking boomerang the new Sherlock thinks it's so much better more

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:22.780
Important and smarter than the mystery stories. It's based on that it cuts out everything that defines them leaving only shameless queer baiting

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:28.700
Pretentious overarching stories that never arrive anywhere and the false assurance that somehow

01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:32.340
Someday all of this will make sense and arrive at an entertaining

01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:37.420
Conclusion that ties everything together and proves you weren't wasting all this fucking time watching it

01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.100
But the sad truth is you were I'm honestly

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:43.620
disappointed by

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:48.940
this work and in a writer who I had a lot of respect for and honestly, I I

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.800
Just think that's a shame. I really do

01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:58.020
Also Benedict Cumberbatch is a terrible actor and his face is stupid

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.700
I

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:07.900
Hey, thanks for watching this video all the way through to the end. I really appreciate it another thing

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:12.820
I really appreciate is being able to afford to take the time to make stuff like this and for that
