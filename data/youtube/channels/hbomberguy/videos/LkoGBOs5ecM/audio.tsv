0	2300	You already know who Sherlock Holmes is.
2300	5240	He's one of the most famous characters in all of Western canon.
5240	11160	He was in dozens and dozens and dozens of stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from 1891 to 1927.
11160	16760	He's a pop-culturally important icon and a foundational figure in the crime and mystery genres of fiction
16760	19080	that have continued all the way to the present day.
19080	24200	The character has been adapted and reimagined and referenced more than any other fictional character,
24200	26040	except, of course, for Jesus Christ.
26040	27360	["Aaaaaaahhh!" sound effect plays in the background.]
27360	32840	The character's so instantly recognizable that, if you strap a hat and coat and pipe onto a teddy bear
32840	34720	and put it in the window of your shop,
34720	39360	people will come in asking how many thousands of pounds they can give you for the Sherlock bear.
40360	43200	["Three. Three thousands of pounds."
43200	44800	["Oh, here it is." sound effect plays in the background.]
44800	50560	There's many direct film adaptations, including, uh, two fun romps made by Guy Ritchie, of all people.
50560	56120	There's a bunch of old film serials, and there's a whole bunch of famous actors who've had a turn playing him.
56160	58440	There's multiple different television versions,
58440	62880	an animated series set in the 22nd century where he got frozen for hundreds of years
62880	65640	and also Watson is a robot for some reason,
65640	71440	and a Canadian children's TV series starring Sherlock's great-grandniece Shirley Holmes.
71440	74680	["Those last two are canon. I can prove it!" sound effect plays in the background.]
74680	78960	And there's perhaps an uncountable amount of books, shows, films, and other properties
78960	83000	directly inspired by or based on the stories and characters,
83000	86160	one of the most obvious and best in recent history being House MD,
86160	91440	a show I've seen all the way through multiple times, starring huge Laurie as Dr. House
91440	94920	and Robert Sean Leonard as Dr. James... Wilson.
94920	95480	You get it?
95480	99280	And my goodness, we haven't even talked about the anime adaptations ye-
99280	100280	Let's not do that.
100280	104440	Then there are the two recent and still active television adaptations.
104440	107080	Elementary plays out like a police procedural in tone,
107080	111520	which is fitting because that type of story is arguably a natural descendant of the original genre,
111520	116760	and it's set in the U.S., this time with Dr. Joan Watson, played by Lucy Liu, and it's pretty good.
116760	120680	It's not as good as House, but it's a well-put-together show and it's very... comfy.
120680	121320	["Sigh." sound effect plays in the background.]
121320	123240	And then there's Sherlock.
123240	128600	Sherlock is an overproduced, overwritten, over-pissed pile of garbage
128600	132760	and the greatest reason ever made to dodge paying your TV license.
132760	136600	But what's so wrong about it? And why do so many people like it?
136600	140280	Or rather, why did so many people think they liked it until season four came out
140280	143160	and everyone collectively realized it was bad and always had been?
143160	145160	And why did that happen?
145160	149560	All these questions and more are going to be answered over the course of this primal, hallucinatory nightmare-
149560	150920	I mean, video essay.
150920	154520	And I hope I can properly impart why this show is such a horrible travesty.
154520	156120	And just to make it clear in advance,
156120	161880	I'm going to do it without ever getting Benedict Cumberbatch's name wrong on purpose for a lazy, overused joke.
161880	163080	Not even once.
163080	164680	Okay, I'm gonna do it once.
164680	166840	Benedict Cumberbad.
166840	168360	Okay, now it's out of my system.

188200	190840	This isn't just the story of one bad show.
190840	196200	Really, it's the story of the life and times of its lead writer, Stephen William Moffat.
196200	199480	Moffat got spat out of a hole in the ground in Paisley in 1961
199480	203880	with the straightforward mission of systematically destroying all of English pop culture,
203880	205800	and no one stopped him yet.
205800	207000	Okay, that's not fair.
207000	209880	Moffat is himself a staple of modern English pop culture,
209880	213320	having written or been involved with a couple of really good shows in his life,
213320	219160	including Coupling, one of the more experimental, creative, and genuinely funny romantic sitcoms ever made.
219160	223240	It's loosely based on how he met his wife, who, by the way, produced the show,
223240	225320	which is probably why he had so much creative freedom.
225320	230120	Although it does raise some questions about how insular the higher-level production staff at the BBC have become.
230120	231560	I'm sure that won't come up later.
231560	233480	After that, during the reboot of Doctor Who,
233480	237400	perhaps the only other British pop cultural staple as iconic as Sherlock Holmes,
237400	241720	Moffat came on and wrote numerous really good episodes that are loved by the fanbase,
241720	246600	giving him massive critical acclaim and winning him, among other things, a Hugo Award and a BAFTA.
246600	250520	If you don't know what those awards are or what they mean, it's okay. No one does.
250520	252520	He's been a fan of Doctor Who all his life,
252520	256360	and in 1999, he even wrote the Doctor Who parody episode,
256360	257880	The Curse of Fatal Death.
257880	260120	Why'd you have chairs on a Dalek spaceship anyway?
260920	263480	Wait, we'll explain later.
264120	267000	This special is one of the best contributions to the series ever,
267000	272520	and somehow still more progressive than the real Doctor Who ever managed to be.
272520	275160	It ends with the Doctor regenerating into a woman.
275160	276040	Scandalous.
276040	280040	Now there's a guy who should be running Doctor Who, the fanbase collectively said aloud.
280040	282200	His writing is scary, dramatic.
282200	286680	He has genuine, established comedic chops, both within and without the science fiction genre.
286680	290840	He might even, you know, make there be a Doctor...
291880	292680	...not played by a man.
293640	294840	You know, maybe.
294840	300600	And in a television miracle, the likes of which hasn't been seen before or since in science fiction,
300600	305080	when Rusty Davies stood down as showrunner, the fans got what they wanted.
305080	308920	["MARFAT'S THEME"]
308920	309720	Oops.
309720	311960	Some of the good aspects of Marfat's writing remain,
311960	315880	but overall, the show is somewhat lacking something with him in the driver's seat.
315880	317880	There's a lot of problems, but the main one,
317880	321960	alongside him not doing the one thing it would have been really cool for him to do
321960	325880	the two times and soon-to-be-three the Doctor has regenerated under his watch,
325880	329320	is that the show is now totally dedicated to the persona of the Doctor.
329320	331400	Previously, the Doctor was the main character, yes,
331400	333800	and he was very important in the story of the canon.
333800	337880	He'd been around for a long time, and he knows the history of the universe almost offhand.
337880	342440	He's dabbled in events so often that writers have played this both for drama and for comedy.
342440	344360	["MARFAT'S THEME"]
344360	347880	["SONIC BLASTER, 51ST CENTURY, WEAPON FACTORIES OF VILLENGAARD"]

349000	349480	["ONCE"]
349480	353240	["WELL, THEY'RE GONE NOW, DESTROYED, MAIN REACTOR WENT CRITICAL, VAPORIZED THE LIGHT"]
353240	355080	["LIKE I SAID, ONCE"]
355080	357320	That once from the first episode Marfat did, by the way.
357320	360520	But ultimately, he was just a guy with his own personality and problems
360520	365240	who liked having adventures and was a single piece of the puzzle of every episode's story.
365240	369640	Marfat's version of the show positions the Doctor as the central puzzle piece to complete the universe,
369640	372760	with an army of secret societies out to personally destroy the Doctor
372760	376680	because he's the most important person of all time, and special, and wow.
376680	383880	["He is the Doctor. He has walked to this universe for centuries untold. He has seen stars fall to dust."
383880	387880	The first episode written by Marfat with himself as showrunner ends with the Doctor winning
387880	391560	by telling the villains how cool and important and special he is,
391560	393480	and this speech scares them off.
393480	397800	It's all about the Doctor, instead of the stories the Doctor interacts with.
397800	401880	The lesson here is that Marfat is a decent writer, capable of being a great one at times,
401880	405000	but a terrible showrunner because he believes his own hype.
405000	408200	He's very good at implying there's something smart or deep happening
408200	412280	and throwing nice tidbits about the Doctor's history into the mix, like the thing about the gun factory,
412280	415720	but he's not very good at actually doing these things that are referred to.
415720	421960	And a story that consists entirely of a man running around implying he used to do cool shit is a bad story.
421960	427000	Marfat simply doesn't write in the way that's required to pace and execute a full series of television,
427000	433320	which leads us to the problem of him getting to do that with Sherlock.
433320	439000	["Sherlock Holmes Theme"]
439000	442360	What made the original stories so popular was the fact they were self-contained.
442360	446200	Apart from a few scant references to other events or the year the story takes place,
446200	449720	nothing connects the Sherlock Holmes stories to each other as a singular narrative.
449720	454200	On top of that, Holmes and Watson don't change all that much as people over the course of all those stories.
454200	456680	This was hugely beneficial to the impact of the work,
456680	459160	because it meant that even though there were tons of stories,
459160	463800	a person could get a complete narrative without the idea that they were missing too much if they read one of them.
463800	469000	It also meant that since there wasn't a larger overarching plot that needed to be served by each individual story,
469000	470760	they all had their own room to breathe.
470760	473160	If all the dozens of stories had tied into each other,
473160	474760	people would have got confused and bored,
474760	479560	and it wouldn't have been as punchy as getting a series of short, complete stories that were all satisfying on their own.
479560	481800	This format survives in many adaptations.
481800	485720	The 40s serials, for example, don't tie into each other at all, even though there's 14 of them.
485720	488760	You can watch Sherlock Holmes and the Pearl of Death, a personal favorite,
488760	492200	and never need to see any of the others to know what's going on or feel satisfied.
492200	495960	And even in elementary or house, while there's narratives that run throughout the series,
495960	500040	most episodes deal with their own particular one-off mystery and don't have to be all interlinked,
500040	503880	so even tuning into a random episode, you feel like you've got a complete story.
503880	507880	I think it's fair to say the episodic nature of Sherlock Holmes is key to its appeal
507880	510120	and should remain in any adaptation.
510120	515080	Sherlock takes the core concept of the storytelling of Sherlock Holmes and why it works,
515080	518680	crumples it up, hides it in one of six busts of Napoleon,
518680	521480	and then uses them as clubs to kill baby seals.
521480	526040	It opens on Watson's experiences scarring him and the murders that set up that episode's killer.
526040	528200	See, it opens on Watson because historically,
528200	531480	Watson is the point of view from which the audience experiences Holmes.
531480	533640	Watson is the one we actually relate to.
533640	536440	We must first understand Watson to understand Holmes.
536440	539400	Remember that because this is the last time it ever happens on Sherlock.
539400	540600	Then Watson meets Holmes.
540600	542680	He comes with him on a case and they begin to bond,
542680	548040	and almost the entire episode is focused on actually solving the crime.
548680	551720	You know, the fun mystery story?
551720	553960	Well, sort of.
553960	558360	About 30 minutes in, Watson is taken out of the story to meet Sherlock's brother Mycroft,
558360	561800	played by Mark Gatiss, one of the other two writers of the show from Moffat.
561800	566360	They take time, attention, and focus away from the plot of the episode at hand
566520	570600	just to let you know as early as possible that Sherlock has a brother who's around,
570600	571960	and he does stuff.
571960	575080	He keeps popping up just to sort of let you know he exists,
575080	577080	and he's keeping tabs on what's going on.
577080	582120	But apart from that, almost a full hour is dedicated to trying to solve the crime.
582120	586040	The first two episodes are probably the closest the show ever gets to being good
586040	587640	because you get a lot of long stretches
587640	591160	where the characters try to use deductive reasoning to solve a mystery.
591160	593720	It's still bullshit, for reasons we'll get into later,
593720	596040	but it's the least bullshit we're gonna get,
596040	598760	and that makes it worthy of a fucking prize.
598760	600040	But then this happens.
600040	603800	The killer, the cab driver, shows up at Sherlock's place for unknown reasons,
603800	607000	and then he just sort of gets into the cab.
607000	610040	Then he takes him to an abandoned building and they play mind games
610040	611960	while he explains that he knows about Sherlock
611960	614360	because Moriarty pays him whenever he kills someone
614360	619080	and also told him about Sherlock because Moriarty knows about Sherlock and is a fan of his.
619080	620520	How did you find me?
620520	621880	I was warned about you.
621880	623320	Who warned you about me?
623320	625080	Someone out there who's noticed.
625080	626520	Who would notice me?
626520	627720	Got yourself a fan.
629560	631000	How did you find me?
631000	632040	How did you find me?
634440	635720	I want a name.
635720	638120	MORIARTY!
638120	640040	Wait, what?
641000	642520	This—I'm tapping my table—
642520	645000	THIS is where the problems begin.
645000	645960	Right here.
645960	649160	Everything in the entire universe of the show exists
649160	652920	to set up the inevitable confrontation between Sherlock and Moriarty,
653000	658280	who already knows about Sherlock and is playing games with him for fun from day one.
658280	660440	It wasn't enough to have a one-off murder mystery
660440	663960	where Sherlock figures out who the killer is and set a good tone
663960	667640	and then maybe have him come up in the future to deal with.
667640	670200	The same thing happens again with the second episode.
670200	673880	It starts out on the right foot with the opening setting up the characters for that episode,
673880	678520	but then at the end, we get this scene where it turns out the villain also works for Moriarty
678520	680120	and he has her killed.
680120	682360	Once again, this is completely unnecessary.
682360	686200	Not everyone bad in the world has to turn out to be working for Moriarty.
686200	687960	This to me relates two things.
687960	691640	One, lack of understanding of what makes the source material work,
691640	694680	and two, the creators' lack of faith in their own material.
694680	698040	The creators have taken a series of stories made famous in the first place
698040	700840	by the fundamental facts you can read them in any order
700840	703080	and made it into a continuous slog,
703080	707080	depicting a pitched grand battle in which most of the playing pieces you see
707080	710120	don't actually have any influence on this wider thing.
710120	711480	None of these people matter.
711480	712600	This guy doesn't matter.
712600	715320	It's all about Sherlock and Moriarty fucking with each other.
715320	718520	Sometimes in the books, Sherlock just helped a couple of people out of a jam,
718520	719560	and that was enough.
719560	724680	Adding in this big, important, grand plan undermines the investment in the actual stories.
724680	727480	A scandal in Bohemia wasn't going to be made any better
727480	730840	by being part of some long-running intellectual magic mind battle
730840	732680	between Sherlock and a gay supervillain.
734920	736680	So Arthur Conan Doyle didn't bother
736680	740200	and instead focused on telling one of the most popular and compelling mystery stories
740200	742520	in the entire Western fucking canon.
742520	745560	Moffat, however, seemed to have other plans.
745560	748040	The worst part is that at some point, Moffat understood this.
748040	750840	The unaired pilot of Sherlock is a version of the first episode
750840	752680	where Mycroft isn't shoehorned in
752680	755160	and the villain doesn't turn out to be funded and informed
755160	757560	by a Moriarty who already knows about Sherlock.
757560	759720	The resulting story is much stronger
759720	761800	because you get the entire episode dedicated
761800	765000	to setting up Sherlock and Watson's dynamic far better than you can
765000	766680	when you're too busy with everything else
766680	768040	and the actual crime they're solving
768040	770440	isn't undercut by already being all about Moriarty
770440	771720	and whatever the hell he's up to.
771720	775640	It gives the motivations and intentions of the episode's villain more of a weight.
775640	778520	In the pilot, Sherlock fucking around trying to be clever
778520	780520	gets him captured by the cab driver
780520	782920	who figures out that he's been found out and drugs him.
782920	786360	You even get a cool exchange setting up Sherlock's previous drug problems.
786360	788440	You do a lot of drugs, Sherlock Holmes?
789160	789960	Not in a while.
789960	791560	I ask because you're very resilient.
792360	794520	Most people would have passed out by now.
794520	797560	This is far better at setting up Sherlock's drug stuff
797640	800280	than having the cops be at his place looking for drugs
800280	801880	and mentioning he used to have a problem
802680	805960	and then he walks out and gets into the cab?
805960	811160	It's like a fucking Mad Libs Chinese telephone version of the plot of the pilot.
811160	812280	It's so dumb.
812280	815160	A thing to keep in mind about the pilot is that it's only an hour long.
815160	817800	I have this theory that almost any story could be improved
817800	820280	if, once the creator came to you and said they thought it was done,
820280	823080	you forced them to take out maybe 10, 15 percent.
823080	825880	It forces them to reassess the importance of what's on the screen
825880	828440	and remove indulgences that don't really add anything.
828440	831240	For example, uh, this section in the script
831240	834360	begins with, like, a 10-minute ramble about the importance of the original stories
834360	836920	but then I decided to rewrite that bit to be a tenth of the length
836920	838360	and that turned out to be way better.
838360	841640	The pilot seems to demonstrate this happening in reverse
841640	844760	where the full show was given an extra half an hour.
844760	846200	So they thought, oh, great!
846200	849400	That gives us time to insert the co-writer of the show's character early
849400	851080	and have intrigue that doesn't go anywhere
851080	854280	because he turns out to be, like, just a normal guy who's worried about his brother
854280	857880	and also connect a nice and simple first story to Moriarty for no reason!
857880	861080	I'll here restate my previous point that Moffat is a decent writer
861080	863480	who would be best utilized in one-off episodes
863480	865720	with strong direction and oversight by others
865720	868520	and not directly in charge of running an entire show
868520	871160	based on one of the most well-known properties in British history
871160	873080	like in Doctor Who or in Sh—
873080	873800	Jekyll!
873800	876280	Oh, you thought I'd forgotten about Jekyll, didn't you, Steve?
877240	879240	Well, I can't blame you.
879240	880520	Most people have.
880520	885800	Jekyll is an adaptation of slash sequel thing to The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
885800	888360	made in 2007 with Moffat writing all of it
888360	892680	and executive produced by Moffat, Catherine Mitchell, and Moffat's mother-in-law.
892680	895880	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is behind Doctor Who and Sherlock Holmes,
895880	899640	maybe the one other really big English pop-cultural character we have.
899640	900520	Can we...
900520	902520	Can we stop giving these to him, please?
902520	905160	It's six episodes and it's quite bad.
905160	908520	It's very bad in some places and surprisingly okay in others
908520	911960	but it exhibits all the same problems as Moffat's work on Doctor Who and Sherlock
911960	915640	so it's worth bringing up as an example of the wider problems with Moffat's writing.
915640	919160	The most noticeable and informative thing about the show is its pacing.
919160	922200	The show opens very strongly with Dr. Jackman,
922200	922760	uh,
922760	927000	aware that he has a condition where he manifests a very strong and dangerous personality
927000	928200	and working to manage it.
928200	932360	We open in media res with someone else being introduced to his techniques.
932360	935640	When I first saw the show, I couldn't be happier that Moffat didn't write
935640	939640	the three previous episodes worth of plot he could have written leading into this room
939640	942360	showing Jackman getting his condition and becoming aware of it
942360	944360	and working to try and find a way around it.
944360	946680	Finding out exactly how the transformation works
946680	951160	and the state of his life and the people in it over the course of the first episode is mostly great,
951160	954040	excluding the bad writing and editing in some places,
954040	957480	but it ends super strong with the viewer interested in what's going to happen next
957480	960920	with Hyde learning that Jackman has a family he's been keeping secret from him
960920	963080	and Jackman getting pretty pissed about that.
963080	967720	Come to my family again, and you and I are at war.
967720	972440	It's a good pilot, and it sells you on the story and the conceit of the transformation very well.
972440	976360	The first episode's clever in places, like with Hyde initially not having a name
976360	981320	and deciding to call himself Billy after kicking a guy's ass and deciding to literally take his name.
981320	985080	Then it gets more intriguing with him meeting someone who addresses him as Mr. Hyde
985080	988360	and referring openly to the actual story the show's based on.
988360	989400	It's a clever twist.
989400	992600	You start out thinking the show's a modern reimagining of the story,
992600	995400	but then it turns out, no, the original book still exists.
995400	1000040	It's genuinely entertaining watching the cogs turn and the narrative do unexpected things like that.
1000040	1003560	But after the first episode, the show immediately begins to fall apart.
1003560	1008040	It turns out that the Jekyll in the original stories was a real person who also existed
1008040	1012520	and had the same condition as Jackman, and also they exactly resemble each other.
1012520	1018200	There's also a secret organization bent on making super soldiers out of Hyde's advanced physiology,
1018200	1022840	a mystery regarding how Jackman came to exist because Jekyll died a virgin.
1022840	1028280	Henry Jekyll died of— Henry Jekyll didn't have any—
1028280	1029080	Do you get it?
1029080	1034120	An unrelated mystery about human cloning that sort of comes in out of nowhere and, by the way, isn't
1034120	1037880	the resolution of the why Jackman exists and looks exactly like Jekyll plot
1037880	1039720	because Moffat felt like being clever.
1039720	1040920	Hyde starts screaming,
1040920	1043480	Why am I not a superman like a tiny baby?
1043480	1047000	And Jackman and Hyde merge their personalities.
1047000	1051080	And all the electricity turns off and he has mind powers and—
1051080	1054360	Oh, and for some reason, a bunch of characters and lines that could have been ripped whole cloth
1054360	1058280	from coupling start turning up in this horror drama four episodes in.
1058280	1062280	But the show even commits, in my opinion based on what I liked about it,
1062280	1063640	the cardinal sin.
1063640	1065640	It shows the backstory.
1065640	1070840	The fourth episode is almost entirely long flashbacks showing Jackman gaining the condition
1070840	1073480	and starting to discover it and figure out how to manage it.
1073480	1074200	That's right.
1074200	1079480	Moffat starts in media res, smartly skipping explaining an origin story that's not necessary
1079480	1082920	for getting to the interesting bits that take place in the first episode
1082920	1085560	and then goes back to explain it.
1085560	1088680	The show ends with Jackman's mother, who has appeared intermittently,
1088680	1093560	suddenly transforming into the lady who runs the organization that's trying to study Hyde.
1093560	1097800	It's a twist intended to set up a second series and its own deeper mysteries or whatever,
1097800	1101240	but the show was cancelled, so we'll never find out what happens next,
1101240	1104680	why Jackman's mother's alter ego was trying to study Hyde in the first place
1104680	1106680	given she could have just studied herself,
1106680	1108600	why Jekyll is so goddamn important,
1108600	1112040	or how the company got so big and rich and powerful over the course of 100 years
1112040	1114840	when it's run by a woman who couldn't have been around for more than 60 of them
1114840	1118040	and all their money was revealed to have come from studying imperfect clones of Jekyll
1118040	1119720	and their cloning was only achieved in the 50s,
1119720	1123320	so how did they get the riches required to learn to fucking clone humans before then?
1123320	1126040	And it turns out that love is what made Jekyll become Hyde in the first place
1126040	1127240	because there is no potion!
1127240	1130040	So they even ruined the premise of the original fucking book!
1130040	1133960	Most importantly, the key word I would associate with Jekyll is promise.
1133960	1136760	Jekyll has, for all its faults, a very strong pilot episode
1136760	1139800	and honestly, Moffat should just write pilot episodes for the rest of his life
1139800	1142280	and then hand the rest of the series off to other writers
1142280	1144280	to play on the interesting ideas he brings up
1144280	1146200	and then abandons while trying to be smart
1146200	1148680	or outsmart the source material.
1148680	1152280	Moffat desperately needs people slapping his wrists away from the keyboard
1152280	1154280	when he decides to write an episode of backstory
1154280	1157320	to a show that started strong specifically by not having any.
1157320	1159560	So we're left with two pilots penned by Moffat
1159560	1162760	which both promise really interesting and good shows and work
1162760	1164760	basically all the way through on their own level
1164760	1168600	but then the actual shows in question fail to live up to any of those ideas.
1168600	1170280	Also, I kind of have to bring this up,
1170280	1172920	the editing of the show is pretty bad
1172920	1176040	but it's clear the editors were given very little to work with.
1176040	1177880	Most of the fights happen off-screen.
1177880	1179960	Here's the scene where Hyde throws a guy out a window.
1180760	1181260	Cheers.
1185240	1189640	They play a glass smashing sound effect before cutting
1189640	1191560	and then it cuts to him getting off the ground.
1191560	1193880	They simply didn't shoot the money shot of this scene
1193880	1196040	of the guy actually getting thrown through the window.
1196040	1198680	The editor had to really stretch the shots they had
1198680	1201480	to make the scene have any continuity whatsoever
1201480	1203880	and you can almost feel the editor's anger
1203880	1207000	at whoever decided not to shoot most of the interesting events
1207000	1208440	called for in the script.
1208440	1210440	By far the funniest part of the show is this outtake
1210440	1212840	an editor left in that nobody seemed to notice
1212840	1215720	where Hyde uses his superpowers to pull out a book of matches
1215720	1216920	and light one out of nowhere
1216920	1221720	but Nesbitt accidentally flings the entire pack directly into his face and eyes.
1221720	1224280	They try and cut away but all they can cut to
1224280	1227640	is this other angle of him doing the same thing.
1227640	1229800	It's like, wow, do you have a take
1229800	1232920	where he doesn't throw the matches into his face?
1234120	1234620	No?
1235000	1237480	Oh, well, we have to go with this then.
1237480	1239880	Actually, considering the way a lot of the show plays out
1239880	1241720	and the lack of coverage everywhere else,
1241720	1244520	I'm willing to bet they didn't even shoot a second take at all.
1244520	1246680	I've spent so long laboring on Jekyll,
1246680	1248600	well, partially because I watched six hours of it
1248600	1251480	preparing for this video and wanted to justify the wasted time,
1251480	1253240	but also because it's very much a blueprint
1253240	1255400	for a lot of the mistakes in Sherlock's writing.
1255400	1257880	What Moffat's really good at is telling single stories
1257880	1261000	that have to start and then end conclusively
1261000	1263320	because you're never gonna see most of these characters
1263320	1264840	or even this planet again.
1264920	1266920	You can't just set up the next season
1266920	1268920	with a hackneyed cliffhanger or whatever.
1268920	1271560	You have to end the story satisfyingly.
1271560	1274600	It needs a big, strong idea every week.
1274600	1277640	I think you know you've got a good idea for a Doctor Who story
1277640	1281400	if you think, well, I've just blown that feature film idea forever, haven't I?
1281400	1281720	Right.
1281720	1285800	That's the size of story that gets you through 45 minutes of Doctor Who.
1285800	1287560	Compare and contrast the writing of this scene
1287560	1289560	from The Empty Child in season one.
1289560	1291800	The Doctor follows a mysterious Mauve object
1291800	1293400	through time as it crashes on Earth
1293400	1295320	and, assuming it would have made an impression,
1295320	1296600	decides to ask the locals
1296600	1298120	if they've seen something fall from the sky.
1298120	1300600	It might seem like a stupid question,
1301160	1303400	but has anything fallen from the sky recently?
1311640	1312840	That's a weird response.
1312840	1314360	He doesn't get it and neither do you.
1314360	1315480	What's going on?
1315480	1317320	And then an air raid siren goes off
1317320	1319640	and he sees the wartime posters and you go,
1319640	1323160	Oh, it's the war!
1323160	1325800	This is a clever and simple setup and reveal.
1325800	1328040	Over the course of the episode and the second part,
1328040	1330360	we learn what the ship was, what it does,
1330360	1331640	what's happened in London,
1331640	1333000	and by the end of these two episodes,
1333000	1335400	you have a complete picture of what happened and why.
1335400	1339000	Also, a guy's face gets turned into a gas mask by nanomachines
1339000	1341400	and it's the scariest thing anyone my age
1341400	1343880	has ever seen in their entire lives.
1343880	1345720	There's good writing and a good story here
1345720	1347560	with a conclusion that feels earned.
1347560	1350760	Moffat's supposedly famous for writing the more dark episodes,
1350760	1352040	but at the end of this one,
1352040	1355160	everyone who has died comes back to life.
1362680	1364600	Like, he un-kills people
1364600	1366600	and yet the tone carries it,
1366600	1368200	makes it feel dark even then.
1368760	1370360	That's just how good he is
1370360	1372280	when he's given a single story to tell.
1378280	1380520	But when Moffat has to write the whole series
1380520	1382360	and manage the wider progression,
1382360	1383640	you start to see holes.
1383640	1386520	Things start being implied that sound deep,
1386520	1388680	seem like they might be going somewhere,
1388680	1389880	but actually don't.
1389880	1391560	His first season starts with the Doctor
1391560	1393000	finding a crack in space and time
1393000	1395880	on the bedroom wall of a girl he happens to run into,
1395880	1397240	and then the cracks keep turning up
1397240	1399080	and a piece of the TARDIS comes through one.
1399080	1400600	Where did the cracks come from?
1400600	1402520	Keep watching and maybe you'll find out.
1402520	1404040	Then it turns out they come from the TARDIS
1404040	1405560	exploding at the end of the season.
1405720	1407480	But why did the TARDIS explode?
1407480	1409320	Keep watching and maybe you'll find out.
1409480	1411000	Oh, the silence did it?
1411480	1413400	Maybe. I'm still not clear.
1413400	1414440	Why did they do it?
1414440	1416200	Well, keep watching and maybe you'll find out.
1416200	1417960	Oh, they did it because there's a prophecy
1417960	1421400	that silence must fall when the question is asked.
1421400	1422680	Who made this prophecy,
1422680	1424120	and what the hell does it mean?
1424120	1426200	Keep watching for yet another fucking season
1426200	1427000	and maybe...
1427000	1429880	Bzzzzt....
1429880	1431640	It also feels like Moffat really did use up
1431640	1432680	all his feature film ideas
1432680	1434440	because he brings back the Weeping Angels
1434440	1435400	for a two-part episode
1435400	1437080	and then they come back again later,
1437080	1438760	even more.
1438760	1440840	In the first series, which is still my favorite,
1440840	1442600	they would have the Doctor do something shitty
1442600	1444120	like torture a Dalek,
1444120	1446280	and he would have to confront himself that episode
1446280	1447720	and get better as a person.
1447720	1449640	Say what you want about Russell T. Davies,
1449640	1450600	but under his watch,
1450600	1452680	almost every episode would feel involving
1452680	1454520	because characters would change or grow
1454520	1455880	or have to actually confront
1455880	1457720	and deal with something about themselves.
1457720	1459160	Why don't you finish the job
1459160	1460920	and make the Daleks extinct?
1460920	1462680	Rid the universe of your filth!
1462680	1463960	Rid the universe of your filth!
1463960	1465160	Why don't you just die?!
1468600	1471960	You would make a good Dalek.
1479560	1482600	This episode explores the Doctor's anger at the Daleks
1482600	1485080	and shows it's an expression of seeing his entire race
1485080	1486360	die in a war with them.
1486360	1487640	Over the course of this episode,
1487640	1489480	he has to confront these feelings
1489480	1490920	in ways he hasn't let himself
1490920	1492200	and grow as a person.
1492280	1493640	It's a really small change,
1493640	1495320	but we get to see it happen,
1495320	1496280	and it's good.
1496280	1498600	In contrast, here's a superficially similar scene
1498600	1499720	in a Moffat-run season
1499720	1501560	in an episode co-written by Moffat.
1502440	1505560	You are a good Dalek.
1506840	1508920	This happens at the end of an episode.
1508920	1510440	The purpose of this scene
1510440	1512680	is to tell you that the Doctor is full of hatred.
1512680	1514920	Not so we can deal with that hatred being there
1514920	1516760	in the actual story of the episode
1516760	1519080	or explore these emotions in more detail,
1519080	1520760	but to make you watch the next episode
1520760	1523000	to see if maybe they'll eventually deal
1523000	1524200	with the interesting thing
1524200	1525560	they brought up and did nothing with.
1526120	1529560	I see into your soul, Doctor.
1529560	1532040	I see hatred!
1533240	1535000	Oh, I've looked into your soul.
1535000	1536680	I see hatred, Doctor.
1536680	1539000	Hatred that a future episode
1539000	1541720	might eventually fucking deal with and be interesting.
1542600	1544200	Do you have it in you to murder me?
1544760	1546120	Did he push you out of that thing?
1546760	1547560	Or did you fall?
1548200	1549080	Couldn't really tell.
1549960	1552520	You can be very mean sometimes.
1552520	1553080	We get it.
1553080	1555160	The Doctor's an ambiguous character now.
1555160	1556920	Are you gonna explore that in more detail
1556920	1558520	or are you just gonna keep telling us that?
1558520	1559400	For all his flaws,
1559400	1561480	Davies tried to make each episode
1561480	1563240	have a satisfying complete story
1563240	1564680	and arc for its characters.
1564680	1565640	I'm the only one left.
1566680	1567180	I win.
1568280	1569400	How about that?
1569400	1570600	Moffat, as a showrunner,
1570600	1572520	tries to make each episode imply
1572520	1575880	something satisfying is maybe gonna happen eventually.
1575880	1578200	You can have all the fantastic premises you like,
1578200	1581400	shrinking yourself down to go inside a Dalek to do surgery,
1581400	1584040	having a sword fight with Robin Hood with a spoon,
1584040	1586840	having to go on a space bank heist with strangers,
1586840	1587400	whatever,
1587400	1589400	but if most of the time the conclusion is,
1589400	1591160	wow, you've got some anger, Doctor,
1591160	1593560	I bet a future episode might bother to deal with it,
1593560	1596280	those episodes are wasting a lot of their potential.
1596280	1598840	Again, this is something Moffat grasped excellently
1598840	1600600	when he was writing one-off episodes.
1600600	1602840	Blink starred characters that were never seen before
1602840	1604120	and haven't been seen since,
1604120	1606120	but it has a complete emotional arc
1606120	1608680	for its main characters over the course of one episode.
1608680	1610120	It doesn't end with someone saying,
1610120	1612920	wow, you have problems you probably ought to deal with at some point.
1612920	1614840	Tune in next week to see if we do.
1615480	1617240	The problem is, when you come down to it,
1617240	1619400	Doctor Who is about visiting other worlds
1619400	1620840	and going on fun adventures.
1621400	1623400	Moffat made it all about the Doctor.
1623400	1624760	In much the same way,
1624760	1627160	the Sherlock Holmes stories are about solving crimes
1627160	1629000	and fun mysteries and figuring things out
1629000	1630280	using deductive reasoning.
1630280	1633400	Moffat made his show all about Sherlock.
1636440	1639880	Sherlock is too important, too special, too powerful,
1639880	1641560	and this ruins the tension of the show
1641560	1643720	and our ability to empathize with the character.
1643720	1646520	The entire show is dedicated to telling you about Sherlock
1646520	1648040	instead of showing you Sherlock
1648040	1650440	by way of his interaction with the actual plot.
1650440	1653640	Season 1 was the only season that came close to getting this right,
1653640	1656120	where you learned what sort of person he was and his abilities
1656120	1658120	based on how he used them in the episode.
1658120	1660280	As the show progresses, the actual mystery,
1660280	1663800	you know, the crimes we're supposed to have fun watching Sherlock solve,
1663800	1665400	take a back seat to the show telling us
1665400	1667720	how cool and wacky Sherlock is
1667720	1669880	and his mind battle with Moriarty.
1669880	1671400	In this episode in Season 3,
1671400	1674120	there's a huge setup just for Sherlock being weird.
1674120	1676840	They spend a pretty sizable portion of the runtime and budget
1676840	1679960	for a quick joke about how rude and thoughtless Sherlock is
1679960	1681960	while Lestrade is gearing up to capture someone
1681960	1683880	who's clearly been a problem with him for a long time.
1684600	1686040	I-I-I have to go.
1688040	1689800	Are there any funny stories about John?
1689800	1691480	They could have just made him rude and thoughtless
1691480	1695080	over the course of the plot of the actual fucking episode.
1695080	1697320	The punchline of these jokes is supposed to set up something
1697320	1698600	regarding the principal characters,
1698600	1701000	but they do it so poorly and in such a roundabout way
1701000	1703800	that they're neither funny nor really tell us anything new.
1703800	1706520	We should already know Sherlock is a big inconsiderate piece of shit
1706520	1708440	because Moffat has been writing him as one
1708440	1710040	for three seasons at this point.
1710040	1711880	This kind of overindulgent nonsense
1711880	1714600	is antithetical to actually telling an interesting story.
1714600	1717080	Nothing remotely like this would have happened in the short stories
1717080	1718760	because they actually had a story worth telling
1718760	1720120	and wanted to get to it.
1720120	1722680	Cumulatively, stuff like this reduces the entire show
1722680	1726280	to Sherlock prancing around showing off how smart and or rude he is
1726280	1729880	and very occasionally pausing to do something.
1729880	1730840	I'll get hung for this.
1731960	1734040	No, no, no, Mr. Pirk, not at all.
1734040	1735240	Hanged?
1735240	1736200	Yes.
1736200	1737880	Sherlock corrects a guy's grammar a bunch
1737880	1740520	for the first two minutes of this episode and then walks away.
1740520	1741960	This doesn't serve the story at all
1741960	1744840	except to tell us that Sherlock doesn't like when you say words wrong,
1744840	1747320	which is, you know, an admirable character trait, obviously.
1747320	1749800	Fuck that guy. He deserves to die even if he didn't do the murder.
1749800	1753160	But it's really not something so pivotal as to be the start of an episode.
1753160	1755000	It's a show about solving crimes.
1755000	1756360	The episode should be starting with...
1757080	1760600	A crime! A thing happens that pequees your interest,
1760600	1762280	like the first two episodes did.
1762280	1764520	But by the time of the third episode,
1764520	1766280	we open on Sherlock being shitty,
1766280	1768520	dramatically walking out and the credits go,
1768520	1771240	and then we cut to Sherlock being shitty in his house for another three minutes.
1773240	1774920	Ooh, there's a head.
1774920	1777320	Ooh, there's a head in the fridge. How wacky.
1777320	1779720	The actual start of the episode's fucking plot
1779720	1781720	is at around 6 minutes 20 seconds
1781720	1784680	when someone suddenly attacks the house out of nowhere with a bomb.
1784680	1787960	Everything leading up to that is Sherlock being bored and smarmy
1787960	1791240	and literally waiting around for the plot to come and get him.
1791240	1793480	Now, this characterization isn't utterly terrible.
1793480	1796200	We do have a strong sense that Sherlock is a dick.
1796200	1798040	But the problem with this is that, in effect,
1798040	1801640	the entire show is bent towards providing characterization for Sherlock
1801640	1804440	and making the story he's interacting with take a back seat
1804440	1806040	until it becomes convenient.
1806040	1808600	In the actual books and many of the adaptations,
1808600	1810920	Sherlock Holmes was not the real focal point.
1810920	1814200	The mystery at hand and the other characters were equally as important,
1814200	1817880	and the point was the way Sherlock interacted with them to help solve the case.
1817880	1820840	Let's take the very first story, A Study in Scarlet.
1820840	1824440	Sherlock, while examining the body, refers to pre-existing events he's clearly studied
1824440	1826680	and actively recommends others do the same.
1826680	1828680	Instead of simply telling everyone how smart he is,
1828680	1831880	he makes a tangible reference to a piece of information that could be relevant.
1831880	1833800	We're seeing his reasoning in action.
1833800	1837000	We're also getting strong characterization while the plot moves forward
1837080	1838920	of Sherlock checking the body
1838920	1842280	and making comments that teach us about Sherlock and about the case.
1842280	1845160	Characterization and story are happening at the same time
1845160	1849320	and not in separate segments for the first six minutes before the story decides to start.
1849320	1853400	Lestrade assumes R-A-C-H-E written in blood on a wall are meant to say Rachel
1853400	1855960	and the killer was disturbed before they could finish writing
1855960	1859240	and that someone called Rachel therefore has something to do with the case.
1859240	1860600	That's all he gets from this scene,
1860600	1863000	the assumption that these words might say Rachel,
1863000	1864440	which it turns out they don't.
1864440	1866520	Sherlock looks at this scene and deduces, for example,
1866520	1868760	the approximate height of the person who wrote the message
1868760	1871000	based on where it had made sense for them to write the letters.
1871000	1873480	Something no one else in the room thought to observe or consider
1873480	1875720	but something that you could absolutely arrive at yourself.
1875720	1879480	This is a tangible piece of information that you yourself could apply to real life.
1879480	1882120	Sherlock just taught you how to figure out how tall someone is
1882120	1884120	based on how they would naturally write on a wall
1884120	1886600	or the length of the stride of their footprints.
1886600	1890440	This characterization is very strong because it gets across that Sherlock is smart
1890440	1892440	but also why he's smart,
1892440	1894680	what he did to learn the things he learned
1894680	1896600	and got across the point of the scene
1896600	1899480	which is to demonstrate the use of his analytical techniques.
1899480	1902120	For comparison, there's a scene in the first Sherlock episode,
1902120	1903240	a study in pink,
1903240	1904200	ooh, do you get it?
1904200	1904840	How clever!
1904840	1907960	where Sherlock goes to a crime scene clearly based on the one from Scarlet.
1907960	1910200	Rach here is written by the victim
1910200	1913720	and it actually turns out that she really is trying to write the name Rachel
1913720	1917240	because knowing German, I guess, is too much to expect of an audience.
1917240	1919320	This isn't necessarily a bad change.
1919320	1923240	What is a bad change is what information Sherlock learns and how he learns it.
1923240	1926520	We're shown Sherlock inspecting the body and instead making the conclusion,
1926520	1929560	based on the inside of a dirty wedding ring being clean,
1929560	1931400	that the woman is a serial adulterer.
1931400	1934040	This actually doesn't have very much impact on the story whatsoever,
1934040	1935880	it's just the writers finding a way to be clever
1935880	1938680	by having Sherlock derive an entire sexual history from a ring.
1938680	1942680	He then realizes something no one else notices and dramatically runs off screaming,
1942680	1944280	PINK!
1944280	1946280	This is tonally, utterly wrong.
1946360	1948360	Instead of being given tangible explanations
1948360	1951480	and the intrigue coming from deciding what to do next with the information
1951480	1952600	in order to catch the killer,
1952600	1955720	you're told to assume someone's marriage is failing because their ring is dirty
1955720	1957720	and that Sherlock knows something you don't
1957720	1959720	and has just run off to deal with it himself.
1959720	1962120	The tone here is utter confusion.
1962120	1964200	Sherlock's smart because he figured something out,
1964200	1967320	but we're not gonna say what or how or why.
1967320	1968120	Just for contrast,
1968120	1971560	the first time we see CBS's elementaries Sherlock on a crime scene,
1971560	1974920	he discovers a hidden room by feeling the incline of the floor with his feet.
1975720	1978360	The extra weight of the Saffron steel reinforcements
1978360	1980680	can cause the floor around it to decline slightly,
1980680	1984520	creating a slope between one and five degrees.
1992840	1994200	This thing with the marble is clever
1994200	1996440	and based on quite simple available information,
1996440	1999640	like that big armored panic rooms are heavy.
1999640	2000760	It's not rocket science,
2000760	2002440	but it's a believable deduction
2002440	2006360	and it did just teach you an actual real-life way of finding hidden panic rooms.
2006360	2007800	This show might not be perfect,
2007800	2008520	but at least they...
2009480	2011400	solve crimes?
2011400	2013000	Using information they detected?
2014040	2015480	Like detectives would?
2015480	2019000	This early scene is the best analysis in the show you're gonna get, too.
2019000	2022120	You are shown pieces of information that lead to a conclusion.
2022120	2025160	For example, he recognizes that she would have had to have a suitcase with her
2025160	2026200	because of splash marks,
2026200	2029240	which the viewers even shown and has a chance to figure out for themselves
2029240	2030520	before Sherlock explains it.
2030520	2032600	But in most investigations after this one,
2032600	2034760	Sherlock starts either making wild assumptions
2034760	2036520	that don't have any basis in reality
2036520	2039720	or straight-up learns key information the viewer isn't even told about.
2039720	2040440	In episode two,
2040440	2043560	Sherlock assumes a man found with a gunshot on the right side of his head
2043560	2046120	couldn't be self-inflicted because he was left-handed.
2046120	2047560	The wound's on the right side of his head.
2047560	2047800	And?
2047800	2049160	Vancombe is left-handed.
2049720	2051720	Requires quite a bit of contortion.
2051720	2053480	This isn't even a solid assumption.
2053480	2056920	In practice, plenty of left-handed people use their other hand for firearms
2056920	2058200	so that the kickback of the weapon
2058200	2060760	doesn't potentially injure the hand you use for writing with,
2060760	2062760	including, say, for example,
2062760	2063560	John Watson.
2066120	2066760	Bing.
2066760	2067480	In episode three,
2067480	2070360	Sherlock has to figure out how a TV personality lady was poisoned.
2070360	2071640	He sends Watson to the lady's house
2071640	2073160	and we get scenes of him checking stuff out
2073160	2074840	and Sherlock starting to watch a few episodes
2074840	2076200	and check the internet for theories.
2076200	2078680	The characters meet up and Sherlock just sort of throws out there
2078680	2081400	that the houseboy who is in a relationship with the lady's brother
2081400	2084680	probably poisoned her in revenge for mistreatment of the brother on TV
2084680	2086600	based on all the research he did off-screen.
2086600	2090600	All we see of this research is her patting him a little bit too hard on the back.
2090600	2094680	Sherlock proves this theory by having a toxicology report come in
2094680	2096360	and show it was botulinum toxin
2096360	2098680	and that the houseboy's job was to give her Botox
2098680	2100840	and that he knows he's been bulk-ordering it.
2100840	2103000	My contact at the home office gave me the complete records
2103000	2104280	of Raoul's internet purchases.
2104280	2106120	He's been bulk-ordering Botox for months.
2106680	2109400	Buy it at his time, then up the strength to a fatal dose.
2109400	2110040	That's right.
2110040	2111880	In a show about solving crimes
2111880	2114440	and giving the viewer a sense of unfolding mystery
2114440	2115880	and maybe giving them some information
2115880	2118280	so they can try and figure it out themselves as they go
2118280	2119960	so, you know, their brain is engaged.
2120680	2124280	Sherlock solves the crime off-screen using information the viewer has never shown
2124280	2126680	or even has a chance to deduce for themselves.
2126680	2129240	He just comes out of nowhere and reveals it was Botox
2129240	2132440	and that he has a friend with the power to find out people's internet purchases
2132440	2133480	and share them with him.
2133480	2136760	The ability to be intelligent in finding and interpreting available information
2136760	2138280	is replaced with a superpower
2138280	2141560	where he holds all the cards and knows more than the viewer possibly could,
2141560	2144360	rendering the experience of trying to follow the story
2144440	2147320	roughly similar to trying to figure out where a car is driving
2147320	2148600	while there's a bag over your head
2148600	2151800	and Stephen Moffat is punching you and insisting he's being clever.
2151800	2153160	In this same episode,
2153160	2156520	based on a guard being found dead who works in a gallery,
2157080	2159240	he immediately then arrives at the conclusion
2159240	2161720	that a recent painting unveiled there has to be fake
2161720	2163880	because why else would anyone ever be killed?
2164520	2168200	And then he concludes based on circumstantial evidence
2168200	2171800	that a well-known legendary hitman we've never heard of before must have done it.
2171800	2173560	One of the deadliest assassins in the world.
2173560	2175640	That is his trademark style.
2175640	2178280	And then someone off-screen finds out where he is
2178280	2180920	and then they go to where he is.
2180920	2182360	Any time you want to explain?
2182360	2185320	Homeless network really is indispensable.
2185320	2187880	Like, all the deduction and thinking
2187880	2191960	isn't done in a way that is actually interesting or fun for the viewer to see.
2191960	2193880	How would a person track this hitman?
2193880	2195480	How would you find out where he is?
2195480	2197000	That's an interesting story.
2197000	2198200	They skip over it.
2198200	2200520	Sherlock literally hires someone else to do it
2200520	2201720	and they do all of this
2201720	2204200	so that Sherlock and Watson have an excuse to run around
2204840	2208280	chasing a really tall guy and then having a wrestle with him.
2208280	2210600	You know, yeah, the original stories were fantastic
2210600	2213960	and groundbreaking pieces of literature about solving mysteries
2213960	2215240	but what they really could have done with
2215240	2217880	was a bit where the main characters wrestle a tall guy for a while.
2217880	2219880	I'll say again that the show does start out better
2219880	2222760	and lots of season one does feature some genuine deduction
2222760	2224600	based on information the viewers also shown
2224600	2227080	but you can see the slip starting to happen here.
2227080	2230120	The deductive reasoning a superior show would be centrally about
2230200	2231720	is replaced with a conjuring trick
2231720	2234120	where you're told later how clever Sherlock was
2234120	2235800	and then he tells you about all the other stuff
2235800	2237560	you didn't even know about that led him to it.
2237560	2238760	In The Hounds of Baskerville,
2238760	2240680	Sherlock intentionally tries to drug Watson
2240680	2243560	with what he thinks is sugar that's had a hallucinogen added to it
2243560	2245160	based on how he thinks he's been drugged
2245160	2247320	and it's the only thing they didn't both consume.
2247320	2249640	The fact it's the one thing they haven't both eaten or drunk
2249640	2252120	isn't established until after Watson has been given the sugar
2252120	2253320	and started hallucinating.
2253320	2256440	The purpose of this part appears to be to make Sherlock look clever
2256440	2259880	for knowing something we didn't even have the chance to think about for ourselves.
2259880	2261640	Also, he could have just tested the sugar
2261640	2264600	instead of trying to drug his friend with an unknown chemical
2264600	2266920	to see what would happen and then testing it later
2266920	2268840	only to discover the sugar is clean.
2268840	2271160	You can even imagine a better, smarter show
2271160	2273080	having a section where the two stop
2273080	2274760	and think about everything they've eaten.
2274760	2277160	Maybe even cutting back to scenes of everything they ate
2277160	2278200	that we already saw
2278200	2279960	because they could have had scenes of them doing that
2279960	2281080	as other stuff happened
2281080	2283640	and eliminating everything except the sugar
2283640	2286760	then testing it in the lab and discovering that it's normal.
2286760	2289480	Instead, all this information is excised on purpose
2289480	2291000	so you can have the mystery
2291000	2293720	of Sherlock maybe drugging his only friend
2293720	2295240	and fill some precious time
2295240	2297480	as Watson hides in the lab from an imaginary dog
2297480	2298600	for five whole minutes.
2298600	2300360	The story it would have made sense to tell
2300360	2302840	is just too normal for Moffat and Gatiss.
2302840	2305080	The real focus is what wacky or cool thing
2305080	2306680	Sherlock will personally do
2306680	2309480	and then how he'll justify it later using bullshit
2309480	2312040	instead of being on the piece of evidence or information
2312040	2314600	and the proper approach to finding it and acting on it.
2314600	2316680	This conveniently lets the writers off the hook
2316680	2319320	for ever having to deal with things like character traits
2319320	2321480	or motivation or choices.
2321480	2323640	When you read a chapter of a Sherlock Holmes story,
2323640	2325640	you feel like you've gotten a little bit smarter.
2325640	2327000	It feels weird to say out loud
2327000	2329320	but often it's like you've personally seen the benefit
2329320	2331080	of a certain way of looking at the world.
2331080	2333640	Sherlock has the strongest characterization in the show
2333640	2335560	but, in effect, it's too strong,
2335560	2337160	pulling the focus away from things
2337160	2339800	that actually make watching him do stuff interesting
2339800	2341720	like the other characters and their lives
2341720	2343320	and the mysteries he's solving.
2343320	2344840	This is a gigantic problem
2344840	2347240	in both storytelling and characterization.
2347320	2350040	A lot of the original stories were only a few pages long.
2350040	2351800	There wasn't enough time to mythologize
2351800	2353320	what a badass Sherlock was
2353320	2355320	because there was crime to solve.
2355320	2356840	The 90-minute format of the show
2356840	2359160	seemingly gives the creators too much time.
2359160	2360920	Hell, the pilot was better
2360920	2362760	because they didn't have that extra 30 minutes
2362760	2364520	to shoehorn in the Mycroft stuff
2364520	2365960	and then tie it all into Moriarty
2365960	2368120	because why not make it all about him, too?
2368120	2369320	Speaking of which...
2371960	2374760	If you thought the show's obsession with Sherlock was too much,
2374760	2376520	wait until you get a load of Moriarty.
2376520	2379320	The entire Sherlock world has been almost completely absorbed
2379320	2381640	into the all-encompassing plans of some guy
2381640	2385160	who was in two of the many dozens of original stories.
2385160	2387720	After being suddenly inserted into the first two episodes
2387720	2388680	to let you know he's coming
2388680	2390760	so you have something to keep watching for
2390760	2392360	because the writing and mystery solving
2392360	2393800	certainly can't be doing that for you,
2393800	2395640	episode three's all weird mind games
2395640	2397960	explicitly for Sherlock by Moriarty.
2397960	2400760	It's all about a big, smart baddie messing with Sherlock
2400760	2402040	but in a really boring way
2402040	2403240	where he holds all the cards
2403240	2404920	and Sherlock never actually outsmarts him,
2404920	2406040	just solves his puzzles
2406040	2408840	but he solves them off-screen or using magic mind powers
2408840	2411000	so it's a struggle we don't even get to see.
2411000	2414200	There's also the problem of him being relentlessly queer-coded.
2415400	2416280	Okay.
2416280	2417880	But the flirting's over, Sherlock.
2417880	2419080	Daddy's had enough now.
2420600	2423160	Seriously, this guy's just the fucking most.
2423160	2424120	Do you like my boys?
2425080	2426680	This one's got more stamina
2426680	2430040	but he's less caring in the afterglow.
2430040	2431640	What are you doing, Andrew?
2431640	2432760	Oh, boy.
2432760	2433880	Do you get it?
2433880	2434760	He's a queen?
2435720	2437480	Oh, fuck you, Steve.
2437480	2438600	Like, I get it.
2438600	2440360	He's really into Sherlock
2440360	2443800	and the writers imply this means he wants to do the fuck on him
2443800	2446120	but, like, why?
2446680	2448440	What does this add to the narrative?
2448440	2452120	Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain
2452120	2455480	so we thought someone who was genuinely, properly frightening.
2455480	2458520	Someone who's an absolute psycho, Moffat.
2458520	2459020	Okay.
2460680	2462760	Number one, absolute psycho.
2462760	2463960	Make him act like a gay.
2463960	2466520	Great, that's really fucking comforting of you.
2466520	2467020	Thank you.
2467800	2472280	Number two, Moriarty, dull and posh?
2472840	2478600	One of the most memorable fucking characters in, like, the history of literature?
2479240	2480200	Oh, yeah.
2480200	2481720	He needs to be fixed.
2481720	2486920	We need to make him into the fucking loudest, shoutingest, prancingest,
2487640	2489960	weirdest, most over-the-top guy ever.
2489960	2491480	Just, you know.
2491480	2494920	Because we really needed to fucking fix Moria—
2494920	2495640	You f—
2495640	2496840	Jesus Christ.
2496840	2499320	Moriarty is self-consciously a villain.
2499320	2500360	He knows what he's doing.
2500360	2501880	He's a nutcase.
2501880	2504120	He knows what he's doing and he's a nutcase?
2504760	2506840	Uh, Mark, those—
2506840	2507720	Those things don't—
2507720	2509320	See? He's an absolute psycho
2509320	2511480	which means the creators can have him do anything,
2511480	2513320	even contradictory things like
2513320	2515480	threaten Sherlock to try and keep him away
2515480	2518200	and do everything he can to protect his identity
2518200	2522280	and needlessly play with Sherlock up to and including fucking just killing himself
2522280	2523800	just to mess with his head
2523800	2525880	and they don't have to justify any of it
2525880	2527720	because he's a complete psycho.
2527720	2529320	He doesn't have to make any sense.
2529320	2531320	We don't have to write a cohesive character.
2531320	2532920	He's mad and that's it.
2532920	2534360	That's all you're gonna get.
2534360	2535400	Fuck you.
2535400	2537640	At the end of season one slash beginning of two,
2537640	2539640	he threatens them, leaves,
2539640	2541320	realizes he should probably kill them,
2541320	2542600	comes back in to do it,
2542600	2546200	then changes his mind again once the cliffhanger's over and season two starts.
2546760	2548040	What's the lesson here?
2548120	2549320	Also, why does he come back in?
2549320	2550280	He could have just said,
2550280	2551480	hey, snipers, just kill him.
2551480	2553720	The villain is practically all-powerful,
2553720	2556680	doesn't kill Sherlock for the sake of the fun of messing with him,
2556680	2559960	and Sherlock never, ever gets the upper hand or surprises him
2559960	2561880	because he's so ridiculously smart.
2561880	2564360	This makes the conflict have no real weight for the viewer
2564360	2566040	and thereby render it pointless.
2566040	2569960	Moriarty always holds all the cards and knows more than Sherlock does.
2569960	2571720	Boring!
2571720	2573720	I could have got them anywhere.
2573720	2576840	In the books, when he's tracking down other criminals and, of course, Moriarty,
2576840	2579320	Sherlock has to try very hard not to get murdered,
2579320	2581640	and in the original novel, literally does
2581640	2585320	because Moriarty and himself end up shuffling off the Reichenbach Falls together.
2585320	2588280	In this version, Moriarty literally doesn't want Sherlock dead
2588280	2590680	and he doesn't really care about his crime empire
2590680	2593960	because he shoots himself in the head simply as a ploy to mess with him.
2593960	2597160	He's just fucking around with an impossibly genius-level intellect
2597160	2598600	to seemingly no end,
2598600	2600440	except literally his own.
2600440	2602440	Sometimes he's a pragmatic mastermind
2602440	2606120	who'll do anything to protect even the vaguest sliver of his identity,
2606120	2607720	like have this lady murdered
2607720	2611880	or detonate the bombs on the old woman when she tries to tell Sherlock he sounded nice.
2612840	2614840	If you don't stop prying...
2616200	2618200	I will burn you.
2619880	2621880	I will burn...
2621880	2623880	a horse out of you.
2624600	2626280	Why not just burn him anyway?
2626280	2631080	Why make this allowance for the one man who actually stands a chance of ever catching you?
2631080	2633160	Oh, oh, because he's crazy.
2633160	2635320	So we don't have to justify it. He's crazy.
2635320	2637720	The original Moriarty shows up in two stories,
2637720	2641000	is formidable and wants Sherlock dead for fucking with him,
2641000	2644200	and the two die in mortal combat trying to kill each other,
2644200	2646600	although Sherlock is eventually revealed to have survived
2646600	2649720	after a full decade of readers being convinced he was dead.
2649720	2653160	This Moriarty runs seemingly all crime everywhere,
2653160	2655720	will go to great lengths to protect his identity,
2655720	2657880	but is also so fascinated by Sherlock,
2657880	2660360	he'll literally kill himself to see what he does
2660360	2661960	while gaybaiting the fuck out of him
2661960	2664120	so Tumblr will give it some shipping attention.
2664120	2666520	Then, when Sherlock dies to stop his plans,
2666520	2668680	ten minutes later it turns out Sherlock isn't dead
2668680	2671400	because the writers can't even trust you to wait for the next season
2671400	2674040	because they're rightfully worried you'd lose interest in this garbage
2674040	2675800	if the story felt too conclusive.
2675800	2679320	He kills himself because I guess they wanted him to do something surprising.
2679320	2681320	The most essential thing about Moriarty for me
2681320	2684440	is that you don't know what you're gonna get on the day,
2684440	2686920	that he has to be completely surprising.
2686920	2689880	So they had him do the stupidest fucking thing possible.
2689880	2691480	The only way this could be stupider
2691480	2694440	is if right before he shot himself in the head for no reason,
2694440	2696280	he told Sherlock he was going to come back
2696280	2698040	for every season finale afterwards
2698040	2700840	as an increasingly stupid and bullshit fake-out
2700840	2704760	or that Sherlock has a secret sister he magically forgot about
2704760	2708360	and also a mega super double secret old best friend
2708360	2710920	who he remembers as a dog for some reason
2710920	2712440	and who the sister killed.
2712440	2714280	That would be really stupid, wouldn't it?
2714280	2717160	But Moriarty's shitty characterization doesn't end there.
2717160	2718760	After the big twist in season two
2718760	2721320	that there is no secret all-powerful hacking technology,
2721400	2723720	No, no, no, no, no.
2723720	2726600	This is too easy. This is too easy.
2726600	2728120	There is no key.
2728120	2731320	You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code
2731320	2733080	are gonna crash the world around our ears.
2733080	2735800	I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed in you.
2735800	2738760	It turns out that it does exist because this happens.
2738760	2740440	They were worried people would stop watching
2740440	2742120	if there was no Moriarty to fight,
2742120	2744680	and they just killed the other quite well-known villain,
2744680	2746760	so they had to make sure they implied he was coming back
2746760	2749240	because if everything doesn't tie into Moriarty,
2749240	2750920	there's basically no story here.
2750920	2752680	He doesn't actually come back either.
2752680	2754840	This turns out to just be, like,
2754840	2756600	I think this turns out to be a plot hole.
2756600	2758120	Like, who did this in the end?
2758120	2759960	Did someone who works for Moriarty do it?
2759960	2763240	Did he set this up to happen long after his death?
2763240	2764760	Uh, did Uris do it?
2764760	2767400	After teasing everyone into thinking he's going to come back
2767400	2769720	and having an entire special dedicated to figuring out
2769720	2770840	that, yes, he's dead,
2770840	2773160	but he must just have some other plans going,
2773160	2775960	it just keeps turning out to not have anything to do with him,
2775960	2779160	and the plot continues on as if Moriarty wasn't around.
2779160	2781160	Then, in the worst episode of all time,
2781160	2782760	it turns out before he died,
2782760	2784760	Moriarty met Sherlock's secret sister
2784760	2786600	and provided video recordings to use
2786600	2789240	in some bullshit thing she pulls for him for no reason
2789240	2791880	other than she's crazy.
2791880	2793160	Woo!
2793160	2794120	Nice one, Steve.
2794120	2796600	You got out of having to characterize yet another villain.
2796600	2798520	At least you didn't make this one gay.
2798520	2800520	Oh, and at the very end of the show, this happens.
2801400	2803480	Surprise.
2803480	2805560	You didn't think I'd just disappear, did you?
2806120	2809000	Now, provided the show actually gets another season,
2809080	2812120	baiting people with the return of Moriarty yet again
2812120	2815320	after all this time establishing he's definitely dead
2815320	2816920	is absolutely taking the piss,
2816920	2819560	and I don't even want to know about a prospective season five
2819560	2820840	or what that would look like
2820840	2824280	because I have no idea how the show could possibly get any worse,
2824280	2825720	so instead I'm gonna just move on.
2828280	2830680	Another thing Sherlock has is a style problem.
2830680	2833240	It's clear the production crew were given a vastly higher budget
2833240	2835480	than the majority of British television normally gets,
2835480	2836600	and you can see why,
2836600	2839880	except for Doctor Who, QI, British Bake Off, Come Dine With Me,
2839880	2841480	and The Legacy of Colonialism,
2841480	2844120	Britain has virtually no remaining cultural exports,
2844120	2847640	so it makes sense for the BBC to invest heavily in the TV adaptation
2847640	2849640	of one of our most important cultural icons
2849640	2852120	so people think we're still relevant as a nation.
2852120	2855800	Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like anyone really knew what to do with that money,
2855800	2859960	so consequently the show is overproduced to the point where it only gets in the way.
2859960	2863000	The show is trying at every moment to be the coolest,
2863000	2865560	most important thing in the entire world,
2865560	2868120	and it has the time and money to execute on this,
2868120	2870600	which isn't necessarily a good thing.
2870600	2873080	The most obvious way this features is the text that comes up
2873080	2875160	whenever Sherlock's doing his magic mind powers
2875160	2877000	or whenever someone gets a message on their phone
2877000	2879240	and appears on screen in a cool visual way.
2879240	2882120	This makes sense, and so do things like having images be wiped
2882120	2884520	by people moving through them or doors closing and stuff.
2884520	2887480	That's just nice editing, and it does help scenes flow together easier.
2887480	2889080	This is a vast improvement on Jekyll,
2889080	2891080	which appears to have been rushed and had no budget,
2891080	2893640	so you get stuff like Hyde's super strength being shown off
2893640	2897160	by having them just fast-forward footage of James Nesbitt walking normally,
2897160	2898280	or this shot.
2908360	2911400	You can see the bones of the style Moffat and the production team of Sherlock
2911400	2913400	finally get the budget to actually make,
2913400	2914520	but it just doesn't work.
2914520	2917080	This is meant to be Hyde drinking a lot of alcohol very quickly
2917080	2920200	because of his advanced metabolism and unexplained superpowers,
2920200	2922760	but it just looks like a guy drinking and fast-forward,
2922760	2924600	and the sound effects just make it silly.
2924600	2927160	A lot of the special effects in scenes that are meant to be scarier
2927160	2931160	just dutch angles and shaky cam with undercrank and weird filters.
2931160	2933400	Sherlock's enhanced budget and scope of production
2933400	2936920	allows it to pull off versions of this without looking as terrible.
2936920	2938520	When Sherlock's using his mind powers,
2938520	2940680	because let's be honest, that's basically what they are,
2940680	2943720	the soundtrack swells and all kinds of cool sound effects are used
2943720	2945800	to get across his sheer attentiveness.
2948120	2951160	Here, for example, because she was scraping the ground with her nails,
2951160	2953640	as the text appears, you hear a nail-scraping sound.
2956520	2959160	Giving the text a sound effect as it writes itself in
2959160	2961560	helps draw your attention to it, make it pop.
2971240	2974680	They use pen drawing and nose-sniffling noises when he talks about those,
2974680	2977240	and you can even see they animate the images as it happens.
2977240	2978840	They do this because they think you're an idiot
2978840	2980920	and don't understand what writing with a pen means,
2980920	2983560	so you need both visual and audio cues.
2983560	2985800	This use of images and sound effects is very effective.
2985800	2987960	It helps trick the viewer into thinking they're doing more
2987960	2990120	than watching Benedict Cumberbatch sit in a chair
2990120	2992040	and tell you about things he's noticed.
2992040	2995080	In a way, I wouldn't really recommend analyzing this show too much.
2995080	2997800	I must mention that paying attention to sound and visuals
2997800	3000680	causes the show's trick to start to wear thin very quickly.
3011720	3013960	The trousers. They're pretty full.
3013960	3017560	At its best, you get intense scenes where the level of thinking
3017560	3019240	being done by Sherlock is highlighted
3019240	3022600	and you're put into his mind with these extreme close-ups and pauses,
3022600	3025720	seeing the world how this mega-genius sees it for brief spurts,
3025720	3027080	and it's all very stylish.
3027080	3029720	At its worst, this style is a stupid nonsense mess
3029720	3032120	that ends up being needless or just straight-up silly.
3041320	3043320	I swear to God, I didn't edit that in!
3043320	3046360	This tonally dissonant nightmare doesn't put us in Sherlock's mind
3046360	3048200	and doesn't even show us his trail of thought.
3048200	3052040	It's just text and images flying past the screen with weird sound effects.
3052040	3054360	This is the sort of thing I would do for a quick joke,
3054360	3056440	not the dramatic investigation scene.
3056440	3057640	Ooh!
3057640	3059000	You ain't got the...
3061480	3064920	The show is so dedicated to this amped-up, over-the-top style
3064920	3067960	that it applies it to places that are incredibly poorly served by it.
3067960	3069560	My favorite examples are in this one.
3069720	3071960	My favorite examples are in the wedding episode.
3071960	3075400	Firstly, you have this bizarre montage of Sherlock and Watson getting drunk,
3075400	3078920	set to a fucking atrocious dubstep remix of the show's theme
3078920	3080520	with a blurry vignette over it
3080520	3082600	because that's what alcohol does!
3082600	3085000	Intersected with ultra-fast graphs of their night out,
3085000	3086760	and you're like, whoa, wait, I didn't even see that!
3086760	3087400	What? What?
3087400	3091320	This is the most overproduced pub crawl in the history of television,
3091320	3094440	but the bestest example ever is earlier in the episode
3094440	3097160	when you have the wedding photographer taking the gang's pictures.
3097240	3100840	Okay, three, two, one, cheese!
3100840	3104520	The music swells, you get this cool time-frozen effect and all that.
3104520	3106360	This shot was quite difficult to pull off.
3106360	3107880	I know someone who worked on this episode.
3107880	3110440	They had to build a giant rig with dozens of DSLRs
3110440	3113400	all at precise positions and angles and focal distances.
3113400	3115560	This is a cool technique two of my favorite directors,
3115560	3118040	the Wachowskis, pioneered for the Matrix.
3118040	3120920	In theory, this is a nice set of shots, right?
3120920	3123480	But there's a difference between theory and practice.
3123480	3125560	What is happening in these shots?
3125640	3127080	How is the story being furthered?
3127080	3130840	What action is being exacerbated by executing the scene with this technique?
3130840	3134760	It's a few, brief, elaborate, expensive shots
3134760	3137800	of people getting their picture taken at a wedding.
3137800	3141080	The Wachowskis only used this technique in the most intense moments
3141080	3144760	of some of the most dramatic and well-edited action scenes in film history,
3144760	3149480	where a single second decompressed during a life-or-death moment has maximum payoff.
3149480	3151560	I don't know which Berk saw this scene and thought,
3151640	3152760	Oh, let's do that!
3152760	3155400	But for the scene where everyone's standing still.
3155400	3157480	But whoever they were, they should have been fired.
3157480	3160200	But I guess, since the writers accidentally wrote an episode
3160200	3163080	mostly consisting of Sherlock farting about at a wedding,
3163080	3165800	I guess they decided they had to blow the budget on something.
3165800	3167960	By golly, I wonder who produced this sho—
3167960	3169240	Oh.
3169240	3172120	Is this a purposeful reference to the Matrix?
3172120	3174040	Like, it wouldn't be the first time they did that.
3174040	3175960	They did that thing at the beginning with the two pills.
3176520	3178120	What's the deal with these references?
3178920	3182680	All right, if you take this pill, you wake up in your bed,
3182680	3186520	and the Sherlock TV series was never made.
3186520	3188360	It was all a bad dream.
3188360	3192040	If you take this pill, you have to watch all of it.
3192040	3192540	Again.
3193080	3193800	Oh, cool.
3193800	3194680	Uh, what do you want in return?
3194680	3196920	Do I need to, like, suck your dick or something?
3196920	3197720	What? No, no.
3197720	3200200	I'm gonna shoot you if you don't take either pill.
3200200	3201480	But you've gotta take one.
3201480	3202360	That's all.
3202360	3202860	Really?
3203640	3206120	Wow, you just talked yourself out of a sweet deal, mister.
3206120	3206620	Oh.
3207500	3210460	Ah, sign me the fuck up, sailor.
3210460	3210960	Ah.
3214220	3216700	I forgot where I was going with this bit.
3216700	3217580	I'm sorry.
3217580	3220940	This kind of attitude to production can be bad for creativity.
3220940	3225180	Throwing all the money ever at every scene means you get shots like this getting in the way of the story,
3225180	3228380	and supposedly tense moments of Sherlock trying to figure something out
3228380	3233180	are ruined by flinging random images and sound effects at the audience in the name of production value.
3233180	3236540	This is the one lesson I'd have expected Moffat to have learned by now.
3236540	3238780	You see, one thing Doctor Who was quite famous for
3238780	3243180	was shooting for expensive ideas and concepts so often with such tight schedules
3243180	3245260	that it becomes necessary for there to be episodes
3245260	3247420	where the main characters don't make too much of an appearance
3247420	3249900	and there aren't too many effects or expensive props.
3249900	3252540	Within these constraints, Moffat himself wrote Blink,
3252540	3255100	one of the most universally loved episodes of the show,
3255100	3259180	where the Doctor and Martha barely show up and the monsters literally don't even move,
3259180	3263340	creating some incredibly tense moments out of almost no budget whatsoever,
3263340	3267260	such as this sphincter-tightening scene of a light starting to flicker
3267260	3270780	and perhaps the most incredibly engaging piece of drama in the entire show,
3270780	3273980	where a character's arguing with a pre-recorded message of the Doctor
3273980	3275740	that knows what they're about to say.
3275740	3278780	How can you have a copy of the finished transcript? It's still being written.
3278780	3281180	I told you, I'm a time traveler. I've got it in the future.
3281180	3282700	Blink won a ton of awards,
3282700	3286140	and I feel proves with its efficient execution on time and budget constraints
3286140	3288780	that sometimes limitations can be good for creativity.
3288780	3291500	I didn't really believe that old aphorism until I saw Sherlock
3291500	3293580	and realized that if you give people too much money,
3293580	3296540	they do shit like this instead of tell an engaging story.
3296540	3299180	This production style leads to characters being underused
3299180	3300700	because they have so little to do
3300700	3303900	because the focus is on overproducing the scenes where Sherlock does stuff
3303900	3307420	and other random bullshit instead of making them a decent addition to the story.
3307420	3310460	This problem even extends to the second principal character,
3310460	3311580	John Watson.
3311580	3314540	Watson sucks and has no purpose in this version of the story.
3314540	3316220	Mary Watson. No, seriously.
3316220	3318940	After shooting the baddie at the end of episode one,
3318940	3321260	Watson has nothing to do and spends most of his time
3321260	3324220	getting treated like shit by his friend for no reason
3324220	3326940	and running around next to him while he solves everything.
3326940	3328940	Watson is the point-of-view character,
3328940	3331740	the literal narrator for most of the home stories,
3331740	3335180	and he barely even gets to see plenty of the events of the plot.
3335180	3336380	What else does he d—
3336380	3339660	Oh, one time he gets kidnapped and Sherlock has to save him.
3339660	3343900	Oh, another time he, uh, uh, he gets mysteriously kidnapped and Sherlock has to—
3343900	3347260	Uh, one time, um, he starts a fire?
3347340	3350300	Oh, and technically, he's there sometimes while Sherlock figures stuff out.
3350300	3352620	He's also here for, uh, this fight, I guess.
3352620	3356140	Oh, and also, there's the time when, uh, he gets kidnapped and Sherlock has to save—
3356140	3359500	One time, he gets held at gunpoint and Sherlock has—
3360140	3363660	One time, gets held at gunpoint—
3366780	3369020	Ah, I just made my ears ring, slapping my face.
3369660	3370780	Jesus Christ.
3371660	3373260	Fuck you, Steve.
3373260	3378380	And oh my God, did you see Watson in the background for this exciting scene?
3379500	3385020	Literally, the most important thing Watson does in all of season two is watch Sherlock die.
3385340	3391580	The wedding episode has a bit where Sherlock tells us Watson is a good doctor and a really helpful ally and provides anecdotes of times
3391580	3393420	he did stuff useful to a case.
3393420	3398460	Wouldn't it have been great if Watson's skills had come in handy in the episodes of the show that were actually made?
3398860	3401260	And not the ones that are his backstory for this wedding?
3401420	3405740	The guy's a doctor and a war survivor and the POV character for most of the books,
3405980	3409020	and he's barely even a presence at his own fucking wedding,
3409480	3412780	dedicated to Sherlock's hour-long speech supposedly about him,
3413020	3416940	but really about how smart Sherlock is for figuring out a crime during a speech.
3417260	3418140	Fuck off.
3418140	3419100	Mary Watson.
3419100	3422540	John's wife is a minor character in some of the books and not super important,
3422700	3425420	but his relationship with his wife does come up in interesting ways,
3425580	3430220	usually in order to make points about the limited roles of women in British society in the time the story was set.
3430380	3435100	In the show, she just sort of appears between seasons two and three. The episode after that is their wedding,
3435260	3435980	although don't worry,
3435980	3440940	we all know who that episode is really about, and then the next episode after that she turns out to be a secret ninja assassin.
3441100	3446460	Then in the next episode, not counting the special because the bulk of it takes place in Sherlock's imagination and she's not really in it,
3446620	3451260	she dies. Mary lived a hugely interesting life and it would have made for a pretty cool addition to the story.
3451500	3455500	Unfortunately, most of it happens in the same place most of the interesting stuff in the show happens.
3456060	3456940	Off-screen.
3456940	3459180	Then for some reason, John sees her as a ghost for a bit,
3459340	3464380	and then she gives the dumbest speech of all time about how mega special Holmes and Watson are, even though Watson doesn't
3464620	3468060	do anything, and even she had more input on the events of the four episodes
3468140	3470940	she had the privilege of being alive for. You've got to hand it to Moffat.
3471180	3473180	He finally created a strong, smart,
3473560	3477980	interesting female character, and then just when she was getting a chance to really interact with the story,
3478140	3484460	he fucking kills her to create tension for the real main characters. Sherlock and whoever this guy is, what does he do?
3484460	3486780	I think he got kidnapped a few times. Nice going, Steve.
3486860	3490460	You fleshed out an actually clever addition to the main story just to kill her.
3490780	3496940	Although I can see why that would be necessary. There's only so many important women in the original stories to ruin, aren't there?
3497400	3499400	Speaking of which.
3504620	3507420	Okay, this is gonna be a kind of tough one to get into.
3508620	3510620	You see,
3510620	3512620	in the pantheon of Sherlock Holmes,
3513500	3519340	there are some characters who stick out so well because they're so unique or different or well-written
3519740	3523100	or special for the time period in which the stories were first made
3524140	3528940	that future adaptations can't help but lavish them with even more attention.
3529900	3535740	You know, you would expect Moriarty to be made into this giant supervillain because,
3536540	3541340	you know, even though he was only in two stories, one of them was the one that killed Sherlock Holmes for 10 years.
3541500	3543500	That's a really good reason to stand out.
3546060	3551180	Irene Adler makes it into almost every single adaptation there is of Sherlock Holmes,
3552060	3554060	and she was in one story.
3554940	3556940	The third one ever.
3556940	3558940	A scandal in Bohemia.
3559100	3564940	Sherlock is approached by the king of Bohemia who is about to get married to a princess and consolidate a shit-ton of land and power,
3565020	3570540	but five years ago he had a love affair with a controversial opera singer called Irene Adler and sent her love letters and a
3570680	3577180	compromising photo. The original dick pic. And since the background of the picture clearly shows his My Little Pony collection,
3577420	3581980	he's worried Adler will email it to his in-laws and the wedding will be called off and he'll lose out on a sweet deal.
3583500	3586000	Her majesty has certainly committed an indiscretion.
3586620	3592780	The king offers Sherlock basically infinite money if he can get that stuff back because none of his people have any idea where it's hidden.
3593020	3598140	So you have a story in which Sherlock is covering up for a king's actions by stealing from an innocent woman
3598220	3602380	who basically did nothing wrong. Sherlock and the king aren't the good guys here.
3602620	3605660	Sherlock is dismissive about Adler. Sure, he can outsmart a woman.
3605820	3610380	He knows what they're like. In disguise, Sherlock tricks Adler into revealing its location.
3610540	3614300	But when he comes back later to get it, he discovers instead a letter telling him,
3614620	3621020	Nah, nah, nice try, idiot, and finds she's married out of love for someone and left the country and just wants to move on with her life.
3621340	3624540	Adler outsmarts Sherlock and gets away with it,
3624700	3629420	which is more than can ever be said for almost anyone else in the entire series. And moreover,
3629660	3632300	she disproves his reductive view of women while she does it.
3632460	3636540	Sherlock loses and has to learn a lesson from it and the viewer is shown that even the great
3636600	3641900	detective is not immune to the biases of the culture he lives in. It's not a feminist story by modern standards,
3641900	3644160	but for a story published by a man in the 1890s,
3644780	3648780	it makes careful strides in showing that not only are women capable of being as smart as men,
3649180	3653340	but if we don't get over the preconception that they can't be, they will win every time.
3653580	3658960	Sherlock gains a grudging respect for her, not in a romantic way, but because he appreciates that he's been outsmarted.
3658960	3661260	What a queen she would have made.
3664220	3666720	Is it not a pity she was not on my level?
3671100	3675660	From what I have seen of the lady, yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your majesty.
3676220	3678220	In 2012's Scandal in Belgravia,
3678300	3681340	Sherlock beats Irene, who, by the way, is sexually attracted to him now,
3681580	3685420	and also then later he saves her life because she gets captured when she goes on the run.
3685660	3689180	Oh, and also she's a fucking bisexual kung fu dominatrix now.
3689900	3690860	That's...
3690860	3694860	That's one way of adapting the story. This episode's already been criticized to hell and back.
3695180	3697580	I'm going to defend a couple of small things about it,
3697980	3703500	like how Adler defeats Sherlock's over-the-top special effects text-o-vision by simply not wearing anything,
3703900	3709100	and I like that the show leaves it somewhat ambiguous whether this is because it leaves Sherlock with nothing to easily detect,
3709500	3713820	or if it's because he just reacted that badly to seeing a naked woman. Those were the pros.
3713900	3719420	Did you miss them? You might have blinked. The cons include everything else. Firstly, she doesn't beat Sherlock.
3719660	3726060	She loses, and then losing puts her in a bad situation, which, don't worry, Sherlock saves her from. How heroic.
3726540	3730460	But secondly, Sherlock's heroic now. This is a big deal.
3730940	3736780	Scandal was impactful because Sherlock worked for the bad guy, a rich and powerful king trying to tie up loose ends
3736860	3741660	so his convenient marriage to someone he clearly didn't really care about could go off as smoothly as possible.
3741740	3747500	Now Adler is directly blackmailing people and also is stealing really important intelligence from the British government.
3747740	3750860	Sherlock is arguably doing the right thing by getting involved here.
3750940	3757260	The moral ambiguity that the original story's had is being erased in the name of making him always the good guy.
3757500	3761980	Then it turns out she's working directly with Moriarty, the real bad guy, because, of course,
3762060	3766540	everything has to tie into Moriarty now, and basically she's acting on his orders and advice.
3766940	3768940	I can't take all the credit.
3769420	3771420	Had a bit of help.
3771900	3773900	Jim Moriarty sends his love.
3774380	3779420	Yes, he's been in touch. And of course, she loses because of those pesky emotions.
3779740	3783980	She couldn't help but have feelings for Shirley because he's so dreamy and nice
3784220	3787100	and not at all a constant piece of shit in the actual show.
3787340	3791180	In an adaptation of a story where the character wins using her own wits,
3791500	3796060	she's told what to do by others and then is beaten and then has to be saved.
3796380	3801980	If the creators of the show were really this disinterested in telling a story using the original traits of Irene Adler,
3802220	3806380	why even put her in here? Why not come up with a new female character to ruin?
3806380	3808220	Oh, no, wait, they do that in season four, don't they?
3808220	3811100	Despite, as you can tell, not really liking the show that much,
3811420	3816060	I was looking forward to this story being adapted because I was hoping for this Sherlock to finally learn
3816140	3818860	he wasn't always right about people and be a little bit humbled.
3819020	3823820	But Moffat was too busy being clever, tying everything into the now all-powerful Moriarty and
3824120	3830860	hashtag modernizing the story by making a woman marrying for love in the 1890s into a dominatrix that he forgot to put in the
3831260	3835900	fun core of the story, and we're left with a Sherlock who finishes exactly as he began.
3836460	3839740	Bored, smart, and the bestest guy ever.
3840620	3843340	Well, I guess he kind of has a semi-girlfriend now.
3843500	3845180	That's kind of like character development.
3845180	3852480	Scandal in Belgravia doesn't just fuck up the most important non-protagonist character in the entire canon behind maybe Moriarty.
3852700	3854700	It also contains the scene.
3858300	3863260	To me, it is always the scene. You will seldom hear me mention it under any other name.
3863420	3869420	In my eyes, it eclipses and predominates the whole of the series. It's the crown in the crown jewels?
3869740	3877580	Of the whole sordid affair. The scene combines all the worst aspects of this fucking show and compresses it down into a solid
3877880	3879420	diamond of shit.
3879420	3885660	The mystery Sherlock is called in to solve before the Adler thing starts is about a guy who's found dead with seemingly no apparent cause.
3885820	3890300	We're shown nothing, no clues that could possibly leave a keen-eyed viewer with the chance to figure it out.
3890460	3895420	He solves it, but doesn't explain what happened or how he figured it out or why, and just stops bothering with it.
3895660	3900220	Then, in an extravagant and fucking ridiculous scene, him and Adler sci-fi
3900440	3905340	imaginate their way through a scene neither of them have actually been to, and Irene discovers that...
3906540	3908540	a fucking boomerang did it.
3908540	3910540	A boomerang.
3910540	3912540	Boomerang.
3912540	3914540	Boomerang.
3914540	3916540	Boomerang.
3916540	3918540	Boomerang.
3918540	3920540	Boomerang.
3920540	3922540	Boomerang.
3922540	3924540	Boomerang.
3925500	3927500	Elementary, my dear Watson.
3927900	3930940	We've talked before about times where the show has pulled something out of its ass,
3931100	3937280	but this fucking scene puts them all to rest. Based on nothing, based on no clues we've been given whatsoever,
3937820	3944700	Sherlock leads Irene to the conclusion that a boomerang did it, and the show presents this as Sherlock being a massive super mega genius.
3944860	3950620	We get shots of Adler making googly eyes at him because she's so attracted to him now that she knows he successfully solved the stupidest
3950780	3952780	written scene in television history.
3953020	3958220	The epic soundtrack swells, and everyone wishes they were being killed by a fucking boomerang.
3958300	3964380	The key to mystery stories, the white, hot, burning core of the genre that makes it what it is,
3964780	3969100	is being given information just enough that you could maybe figure out what was happening,
3969260	3973660	and then having a character show you something about the information you managed to miss, or
3973820	3976220	put the pieces together in a way you wouldn't expect.
3976540	3983260	But to make sure you can't possibly solve it before Sherlock does, because he's supposed to be the most amazing special boy in the world,
3983420	3985840	they can't risk giving you too much information.
3986060	3989740	So they craft a story in which you're shown basically nothing, and then told,
3989820	3996380	Bing! It's a legendary serial killer I just made up. Bing! Someone else told me the answer off screen. Bing!
3996460	3999980	It was a fucking boomerang! The audience will never really accept
4000140	4004940	Sherlock as smart, because they're never given the pieces for themselves, and then presented with a solution
4004940	4010380	they wouldn't have thought of. Instead, they're told next to nothing, and then Sherlock walks in with the information
4010460	4013760	you didn't have, or does something unbelievably unrealistic.
4014700	4016700	You got that from one look?
4017420	4019420	Definitely the new sexy.
4019900	4026300	The show is edited as if you're supposed to, like Adler, be completely in awe of this genius, but that's never gonna happen.
4026700	4031980	Contrast is required. This is precisely why puzzles are fascinating in the first place. There's a tangible,
4032680	4036560	emotional reaction to figuring out how to solve something, and putting something together.
4037100	4042140	Similarly, for a mystery story to work, you have to be shown the problem and the clues before it's solved,
4042140	4046300	so you have a chance to do it yourself, and then marvel at seeing someone else find the solution.
4046380	4051900	You're entertained by seeing someone else solve a puzzle you can't, because you recognize they've seen something you haven't.
4052220	4055660	Sherlock gives you a meaningless glimpse of a trivial piece of the puzzle,
4055900	4059340	then produces the finished puzzle, and tells you it was very hard, I promise.
4059660	4065420	In this show, the viewer's never given a chance to observe, so there's nothing for Sherlock to reveal he observed.
4065500	4069980	So you're left with an incredibly expensive sequence of elaborate camera tricks shot on an Arri Alexa,
4070060	4075900	featuring a man telling you he's very smart, because he observed events you never got the chance to observe better than you.
4076140	4078140	Look at all these hard-working people,
4078220	4081820	dragging their camera rigs all the way out here so they can film a smooth transition,
4081980	4087420	laying all their dolly tracks, and looking a couch all the way out there, and carefully planning and timing dozens of shots,
4087660	4093340	doing excellent professional work, and it's all in service to a mystery story where you're not told anything,
4093660	4096300	so you're not engaged with it at all, and then at the end,
4096540	4101340	you're told a fucking bullshit explanation that you could not have seen coming, and he was really smart.
4101420	4104620	You just have to trust me. Why is the camera spinning so much?
4104700	4109820	Is it to make this revelation feel more dramatic, or is it to simulate the spinning of a boomerang?
4110220	4112060	Do boomerangs even spin?
4112060	4113340	Is that why they did this?
4113340	4119980	Fittingly, this scene keeps coming back in my nightmares to taunt me with how stupid it is.
4121980	4123340	This scene is so bad,
4123340	4130380	it almost makes you forget that the final scene of this episode is Sherlock single-handedly fighting Al-Qaeda with a machete.
4130540	4133820	I half expected the boomerang to come back and take a couple of guys out for him.
4135260	4136700	Credit where credit is due,
4136700	4141740	there's still a lot to like about the Sherlock Show, at least to begin with. For all its massive flaws,
4141820	4144860	it's still very good at making you think it's going to get better,
4145100	4149260	and there are plenty of decent moments and fun bits that make you keep watching just to see,
4149660	4155020	just to see if it can start having more of them and maybe go somewhere with all the plots it has going. Season 4
4155400	4161020	destroyed that illusion. Let me explain in a roundabout way first. When I was doing research for this video,
4161020	4167020	I stumbled upon a bunch of theories about Season 4. The usual Sherlock stuff explaining how secretly gay the main characters are,
4167180	4170220	but the one that really caught my eye was the Lost Special Theory.
4170380	4176460	You see, for some Sherlock fans, the fact the show is bad is just a minor hitch in the grand scheme of the amazing
4176760	4180940	metanarrative of Moffat's mythic reimagining of Sherlock as a magical pretty boy.
4181180	4188700	Thus, the horrific badness and plot holes of Season 4 are just more data to incorporate into a running theory about what's really going on.
4188860	4194700	The conclusion quite a lot of people reached was that the last episodes of Sherlock couldn't possibly be as bad as they were.
4194940	4202540	Instead, it's a fake-out, a build-up to a secret, unannounced fourth episode of Season 4 in which everything is really explained.
4202700	4209180	The garbage from the previous eight, sorry, three episodes is revealed to be a hallucination or a play or a dream sequence,
4209660	4212460	and the show finally turns out to have always been good.
4212620	4218860	The main focal point of the theory was a show supposedly starting just after the end of Sherlock called Appletree Yard.
4219020	4225120	The theory is that Appletree Yard is a codename, and in reality, it's when the fourth Sherlock airs and all is revealed.
4225660	4230460	The proof? The show's website's German language version or something is a 404 page.
4231160	4232540	404.
4232540	4235260	Get it? Season 4? Episode 4?
4235500	4239420	Oh my god, even the inventor of HTTP's error messages is in on it.
4239420	4243500	And if that wasn't enough to prove it, the lead actress's name is Emily Watson.
4244360	4245900	Watson.
4245900	4249500	Watson. And if that's not enough to convince you, and I certainly hope it isn't,
4249740	4253740	there's plenty more evidence coming your way. At one point in the show, Sherlock says,
4254700	4258460	We found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat.
4259100	4260860	All your possessions were searched.
4260860	4266280	Speaking of something comforting about the number three, people always give up after three.
4266280	4267180	See?
4267180	4269180	Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.
4269580	4270940	The Appletree.
4270940	4275820	Clowns, magpies, and fish, none of which go together whatsoever aesthetically.
4275900	4278540	But all of which has intricate symbolic meaning.
4278540	4280540	Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.
4281180	4286300	And in this promotional image for the series, Mark Gatiss is holding up four fingers. See?
4286300	4288300	Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.
4288700	4290940	Oh, wait, that might have just been because it's the fourth season.
4291020	4295980	But you can see how the crushing weight of all this evidence caused me to hold off on working on this video for a while.
4296620	4300380	Just in case it turned out that there really was going to be another one.
4300700	4305820	Just in case Appletree Yard was fake, and Moffat was really a secret genius,
4306060	4310300	only pretending to be a bad showrunner this entire time, and then Appletree Yard aired.
4310780	4316220	And guess what? You'll never believe it, but it turns out it was an adaptation of Appletree Yard,
4316540	4321660	starring Emily Watson, which is just her name, because some people are called Watson.
4322060	4324700	The hashtag on Twitter for Appletree Yard when it aired was,
4325420	4330300	5% people interested in this new show or an adaptation of a book they quite liked, and 95%
4331100	4337180	pissed Sherlock fans, waiting to see when Sherlock would show up and retroactively justified the bad show he was in.
4337340	4341580	It didn't happen, and the fan theory people were mostly apologetic about getting everyone's hopes up, or
4341820	4346940	annoyed that it turned out their show had always been bad, and had just tricked them into thinking it would be with flashy,
4347240	4349500	overproduced, bullet-time wedding photos.
4349900	4353500	I wouldn't write this if I wouldn't be utterly convinced that this is going to happen.
4354060	4359260	Johnlock is endgame. The series isn't finished yet, and I'm going to tell you why.
4359740	4365500	Because it doesn't make sense. I want to remind you that these people have been producing Sherlock for seven years now.
4365900	4371420	Seven years. They put hard work into it, told us again and again that every little detail matters.
4371740	4378460	Do you truly believe anyone on the show, including the producers, the cast, etc., would all suddenly lose their minds overnight?
4379000	4380700	Overnight? I mean, it's possible.
4381020	4386300	I can't even tell you which night it was. The one right before Moffat decided to adapt Sherlock Holmes.
4386460	4389260	I've never actually thought Apple Tree Yard was a completely fake show,
4389260	4395120	so literally all this does is defer my questions. Why was the final problem badly written on purpose?
4398540	4404060	No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to tell you this, but it wasn't bad on purpose.
4404460	4408940	They were trying to make a good show and failed, and even if it's bad on purpose,
4409340	4412780	that still just means the show's bad. A secret fourth episode
4413100	4419900	still wouldn't be a get-out-of-jail-free card for wasting your goddamn time, and more importantly, mine.
4420300	4424380	But since the secret lost episode never came to fruition because it doesn't exist,
4424780	4430700	I can finally conclude that I have, in fact, seen all of season four of Sherlock and can therefore weigh in on it.
4431420	4433420	It's really bad.
4433420	4439180	So bad that people who wanted to like the show had to invent a secret good episode that would, if it existed,
4439500	4444060	somehow fix it. It's orders of magnitude worse than the rest of the show,
4444300	4449180	and I'm pretty sure I've established that's already pretty bad. But what's bad about it goes fairly deep.
4449500	4455660	It's not just that it's worse written, the characters are facsimiles of themselves, and the driving thrust of the story is utterly fallen apart.
4455740	4460620	It's that ultimately it trips on the curtain and tears away all the flaws of the entire show from front to back,
4460940	4465020	revealing it to have always been the worst, like a car that looks like a shambles,
4465020	4467520	but at least convincingly seems to be headed in the right direction,
4467820	4472460	until it collides with a brick wall and turns out to have been a doomed journey from the very start.
4472620	4475820	So after the special in which Sherlock imaginary solves a crime
4475900	4479340	he knows very little about and he figures out that Moriarty's definitely dead,
4479420	4485820	so the game-changing twist of two years ago was once again fake fucking bullshit nonsense designed to trick you into thinking the show was going
4485820	4491900	to get interesting. The implication was that Moriarty had some kind of plan designed to be executed after his death in order to, what,
4492220	4493500	taunt Sherlock?
4493500	4495660	Gain power he doesn't need because he's dead?
4496220	4499260	Destroy the world or just mess with people for the fun of it?
4499820	4500780	Who knows?
4500780	4504620	I don't, because Moriarty doesn't figure at all into the actual plot of season four.
4504780	4510460	The special also ends by implying something interesting is going to happen, with Sherlock striding off saying that he knows what Moriarty's people are
4510460	4511580	going to do next.
4511580	4513580	I know exactly what he's going to do next.
4513580	4519820	The episode begins with Sherlock revealing he has no idea and he's just going to wait and see what happens next and react to it.
4520220	4523180	We brought you back to deal with this. What are you going to do? Wait.
4523660	4525180	So it's a setup for nothing.
4525180	4529580	This is something a series has always done by ending implying something interesting is about to happen next and then
4530220	4534220	it doesn't, but this series is especially fucking egregious about this.
4534460	4539260	Instead Sherlock happens to notice a Thatcher statue broken and becomes fixated upon it
4539500	4544940	and somehow becomes certain the remains of Moriarty's network want a pearl that might be hidden in the last Thatcher statue.
4545100	4547580	What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?
4547580	4549020	I can't stand it. Never can.
4549020	4550780	I have the strangest feeling.
4550780	4552220	It is me.
4552220	4557180	But then it turns out no, it's a completely unrelated series of events revolving around Watson's wife again.
4557340	4563020	By the way, this is the exact bullshit twist they pulled in the previous episode where it turns out it's about Mary.
4563260	4566540	It's hard to explain just how much whiplash there is in this season.
4566780	4571260	The case in point with this one is that you spend the whole time waiting on a reveal that Sherlock really was onto something
4571580	4575900	and then actually he's onto something completely different we also had no way of seeing coming.
4576060	4580780	So then Mary goes undercover to try and hide so she can't be found by the other cool assassin guy
4581180	4583020	and basically chooses random numbers
4583020	4587900	so she's untraceable with this long montage showing just how hiding-y she's being and wow,
4587980	4591820	she's incredibly super off the grid. We get it. And then bam, Sherlock's there.
4593260	4595260	How did you find me?
4595420	4596620	I'm Sherlock Holmes.
4596620	4603420	Really though, how? Every movement I made was entirely random. Every new personality just on the roll of a dice.
4603500	4607580	Once again, here's one of the key sorts of question begged by Sherlock Holmes stories.
4607740	4609580	How did he solve the puzzle and figure it out?
4609580	4612300	What sort of genius application of reason will make you go
4612380	4619980	ah and feel like an idiot and marvel before the simplicity of it? The show recognizes that these questions are the point of Sherlock.
4620300	4625340	Mary, no human action is ever truly random and I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine the seemingly
4625580	4629840	infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
4630060	4633740	But they're really difficult so instead I just stuck a trace on the inside of the memory stick.
4634220	4639740	But instead of giving a useful answer we get this bullshit fake explanation that turns out to be fake
4640220	4644460	and actually he just put a tracking device in the USB pen that she took from him.
4644700	4650220	This is played for a joke, but it's not a comedy fun time jokey joke to laugh at for comedy hijinks.
4650300	4655980	It's a joke at the expense of the audience for even wanting to know how Sherlock did something.
4656300	4661100	Sherlock finds Mary and fuck you if you hoped for or expected something clever.
4661260	4666860	Then the assassin she's hiding from turns up because of course he was tracking Sherlock who knew he would track Mary.
4666940	4671660	So we have this mega genius who knew to plant a tracking device before Mary could drug him and take the device
4671740	4673740	but somehow isn't smart enough to A.
4673900	4678540	Detect Mary was going to drug him and maybe stop her or talk her into working with him.
4678780	4683740	B. React at all in a productive manner the way he did when he had a 10 minute sequence dedicated to
4683980	4687900	how he reacted in the five seconds of consciousness he had as he passed out from being shot
4688540	4694460	by Mary who at this point he maybe should be capable of anticipating attacks from or C.
4694780	4699820	Notice he was being tracked himself or even think to consider he might be tracked by the assassin
4699820	4705900	He'd met before and who knew who he was. So if everyone successfully tracks everyone to the same place and they fight
4705980	4711500	Anyway, what was the point in writing it? So that this happens like this adds nothing to the actual story
4711580	4717500	It's all a setup for this big fucking joke about how cool Sherlock is which we've been told enough by now
4717660	4721180	This is yet more time that could have been spent telling a story
4721500	4722300	It's a farce
4722300	4726460	But it's rendered tragic by just how good Sherlock Holmes stories and adaptations can be
4726780	4734140	Sherlock Holmes and the Pearl of Death adapted the same story fairly excellently by having clearly delineable themes about the power of money and greed
4734220	4739660	And fear and having the MacGuffin actually just be a nice pearl lots of people wanted
4739900	4745020	The pearl has been unobtainable across history because no group endeavor to find it has ever gone without
4745100	4751260	Internal tensions all vying to take it for themselves. They always end up all killing each other and dying and leaving it lost again
4751500	4754300	It stands for a deeper problem with the human soul
4754700	4761020	All Sherlock's moves are understandable or explained in retrospect when the time comes with a nice reveal or
4761480	4766780	Justified by reasoning that you could have noticed at the time and then maybe Sherlock reveals it and you go
4766860	4773600	Ah, of course, it's a delightful romp where the story makes goddamn sense and real themes are explored
4774380	4779520	No more than a symbol of the greed and cruelty and lust for power that have set men at each other's throats down through the centuries
4780520	4783920	The struggle will go on Watson for a pearl
4785720	4787720	Kingdom
4788360	4790360	Perhaps even world dominion
4790800	4794440	To the greed and cruelty of burned out of every last one of us
4796520	4798520	When that time comes
4799680	4801680	Perhaps even the pearl
4802480	4804480	Will be washed clean again
4805480	4806760	It's
4806760	4812480	A good adaptation because it understands what was good about the original story and plays off it
4812560	4815740	It doesn't do it for the first like
4816320	4823840	Maybe 30 minutes and then it actually becomes as fucking stupid spy thing that once again is all about Mary in this story
4823840	4827280	The killer is trying to kill Mary because he misunderstood a conversation
4827280	4832320	Some torturers were having and assumed they were talking about Mary and therefore sought revenge for years and years and years
4832520	4836720	The entire plot of this episode revolves around mishearing someone it's
4837480	4839840	Literally the plot of the second half of Shrek
4839920	4847240	but with some superficial aspects of the basic plot of the six Napoleons draped across it for the simple reason of
4847560	4852200	Resembling a real Sherlock Holmes story. What are the themes? What's the story about?
4852600	4859660	How does Sherlock happen to stumble upon the one crime being committed right that moment that happens to directly concern Mary Watson?
4859860	4867140	Presumably because of magic Sherlock's so smart that he saw something and figured it out without even knowing he'd done it
4867220	4870780	Because at this point that's how fucking bullshit the show is and yes
4871140	4876980	Sometimes that is the justification for things he notices. You could attenuate to every strand of quivering data
4877340	4883880	The future would be entirely calculable. I figured it out because I'm attuned to every data point
4884200	4886500	Well, that's really fucking convenient, isn't it?
4886500	4889900	It saves you having to write a story that people have to follow
4889900	4895660	Oh, no, it doesn't because those are the people who watch it. This has to be entertaining for us to watch Steve
4896140	4901600	Did you did you forget that the closest this episode has to a theme is this was a mistake?
4901740	4905420	This never should have gotten this far. Thank God. It's the last season
4905420	4909340	The show is so self-aware that killing off Mary Watson is a bad idea
4909700	4912020	That she's actually still in the other two episodes
4912500	4917740	Like she's a ghost for some of the second one and she appears on DVDs and then in the third one
4917740	4920600	She she's another one that she knew to send
4921540	4926500	Afterwards the second DVD by the way who uses DVDs anymore
4926820	4931020	She of all people should know that USB pens are the way forward
4931020	4935540	Hey, remember the plot of Sherlock the story's twists undercut itself by trying to have you know
4935540	4937260	An interesting story that ties together well
4937260	4942780	But then having Moriarty turn out to have nothing to do with it all or having Sherlock successfully track Mary only
4942780	4948300	It's just a tracking device or having the assassin be trying to kill Mary for something from her dark past except it turns out
4948300	4954060	She did nothing wrong this endless twisting and untwisting runs through season 4 to such a degree that you can never be certain of anything
4954060	4956780	And this makes you unable to give a shit about any of it
4956780	4963300	Also, this is the second time now in two seasons or two slash three episodes depending how you count it the Sherlock completely
4963740	4968460	Coincidentally stumbled into a story that directly concerns Mary while trying to do something else
4968540	4971500	Would it really have been that hard to tie things together?
4971780	4977620	Case in point with the twisting and untwisting you have Mary have this dark past right like her whole thing is she used to do
4977620	4982380	Some bad stuff. So then when someone from her dark past is looking for a seeking revenge. You're like, oh
4982740	4988060	This is the comeuppance for that. This is an interesting thing to explore. But then it's like now she didn't do anything wrong
4988060	4990660	she was fine, she was actually his friend she was good all the time and
4991620	4993180	He's mistaken
4993180	4997800	So I guess that's fucked the villain of episode 2 is Culverton Smith
4997820	4999820	There's no evidence that he's a criminal
4999820	5006980	But you begin the episode knowing he's a bad guy because his daughter says to Sherlock that she remembers him
5006980	5010580	Saying he's a murderer. So we already have his confession
5010980	5017540	Then it twists and says our she was fake. But then within about five minutes it untwists because he did do it. So
5018340	5025380	Again was the fucking point and then it turns out that he didn't hallucinate that woman. She was actually his secret sister in disguise. Oh
5026340	5028340	Fuck they actually wrote that that wasn't
5028780	5030540	Jesus fucking Christ
5030540	5036420	One thing they could have immediately done to improve this season is have the untwist not happen
5036420	5038740	Like have the guy who's trying to get revenge on Mary
5039540	5046820	Actually have justifiable reasons for trying to kill her like maybe she did betray him or maybe have Sherlock
5046900	5048900	actually hallucinate a
5048980	5056680	Confession and Culverton Smith is innocent have an episode dedicated to Sherlock's actual breakdown instead of him obviously faking it
5056820	5063180	Which it's obvious because you already know he's bad because even after it turns out that
5063580	5065580	He hasn't actually met his daughter before
5066460	5070620	Within like a couple of minutes there. He is saying nah now you're right
5070620	5074780	I'm the bad guy, but no instead they always make sure that the characters are a hundred percent, right?
5074820	5077580	Mary never betrayed anyone and was very reliable and
5078460	5085060	Sherlock did not hallucinate and it was all pretend and he was right all along even though a couple things turned out to be
5085500	5090100	Not what he thought they were and it's just oh well fuck off then the characters aren't really being challenged
5090100	5094180	We were told that Sherlock was right in the first five minutes, and it turned out to be right so
5094820	5097520	What was the point of the last hour and 25 minutes?
5097520	5103380	They never explain of course how Sherlock's sister figured out that Culverton Smith was a villain because you just have to assume
5103380	5107180	She's a super genius who figured out with magic. Why did any of this happen?
5107460	5111980	Why did his sister pretend to be Culverton Smith's daughter in order to make Sherlock catch him?
5111980	5117260	Why did she pretend to be Watson's therapist? Why did she flirt with Watson in disguise?
5118100	5120100	making funny face
5122100	5124100	I think I'll put a hole in it
5126160	5131260	Why does she say I'll put a hole in his head and then it turns out she just tranquilized him
5131380	5138240	Why does she do anything well because like Moriarty she wants to test Sherlock or play with him or just
5139300	5144440	You know mess with his head or something just because why is she doing it now?
5145580	5152220	But everything is compounded in the final episode an episode so bad that even the show's greatest fans
5152300	5157940	Wish it was fake just to set up how fucking bullshit this episode is
5157940	5164500	Let me explain the opening in detail a girl wakes up on a plane everyone else on it is out cold or dead
5164500	5170100	She looks around her. There's no one to help. She's in trouble a phone rings, and she hears Moriarty
5180100	5185660	This is a fairly okay set up isn't it by the end of this episode Moriarty is still dead it turns out
5185660	5186800	That's just a recording
5186800	5193140	but also it isn't even a recording and isn't playing to anyone because none of this is happening because it's all just a fantasy story
5193140	5199940	By Sherlock's sister that she's making up and telling Sherlock perhaps the only thing sadder than the lost special theorists are the people who are like
5199940	5203140	Oh, no, there's loads of really deep stuff going on in the background
5203140	5208020	Let me explain to you how it's secretly very smart so like a plane full of dead people
5208340	5212660	except one girl with zero clues suggesting that the adults may be
5212820	5215780	Inhaled or ingested something that the girl didn't or any
5216180	5220940	Explanations for how this plane could stay airborne for several hours with no one flying it
5220940	5227780	I don't think we were ever meant to interpret this literally the show wanted us to doubt the authenticity of all this see they
5227780	5233980	Certainly imply. This is a fake story by having there be hints in the form of the story being so ridiculous. It's impossible to believe
5234740	5241820	Listen I hate to burst your bubble, but those aren't really hints at all. This is the sort of crazy stupid bullshit
5241860	5247300	We've been expected to believe over the course of this entire fucking show in one episode
5247300	5251220	It turned out a boomerang did it and in that same episode?
5251420	5259180	Mycroft's plan literally involved making an entire plane full of dead people this literally fucking happened in the fucking show
5259180	5263940	And suddenly we're supposed to cotton on to how unrealistic it is now
5264660	5266060	Fuck off
5266060	5267620	Fuck off
5267660	5272620	Stop it, please stop trying to trick people into thinking this bullshit was smart
5273140	5278580	Please the show opens with a relatively interesting setup and it concludes by telling you it made all of it up
5278580	5284100	And it's a lie, and that's the running theme of this episode nay this season nay this entire show
5284620	5289420	Relatively clever setups that imply something cool is gonna happen, and then it's fucking
5289940	5291260	Undoes itself
5291260	5297340	Mycroft is chased around by a fucking clown and his pictures start to bleed out of the eyes and you're like oh fuck
5297340	5301300	What the hell is happening? Oh, it's just Sherlock messing with him. Oh, okay?
5301300	5307060	Oh, well Sherlock's on the trail of Moriarty's secret gang trying to find oh no
5307060	5312820	It's not oh my god a DVD with a message on it. This might be the final message from Moriarty. No. It's not oh my god
5312820	5317180	Sherlock actually hallucinated a confession, and he actually has a problem no no holy shit
5317180	5322020	Did Mary betray her oldest friends and comrades no don't worry? She didn't know it's fine
5322300	5326940	How Holmes and Watson gonna get out of that he walks out he walks out holy shit
5326940	5333020	Who's this fucking shady guy who just abducted Watson? Oh, it's his brother and everything's fine doesn't matter who cares holy shit
5333020	5336820	They just fucking killed off Sherlock. How are they good? Oh? He's fine. Oh all right?
5336820	5342180	Oh my god Moriarty's back, and he's got some cool plan and he can hack all the things in London. No he can't
5342180	5344180	He's not even in this story
5346260	5349100	What makes season four in particular so disliked by fans
5349100	5354860	Isn't that it's that much worse than the rest of the show although it is it's that at this point people are starting to realize
5354860	5357100	That all these setups will have no payoff
5357540	5360140	Anyway back to the episode at hand Sherlock
5360140	5362820	Mycroft and Eurus Holmes are all super geniuses right
5363060	5369380	Eurus is set up to be so amazingly mega smart even as a kid that she got too smart and became a psycho murderer that
5369380	5376940	Sherlock forgot about because it was too traumatic the final episode is guess what season 1 episode 3 again with Eurus taking the place
5376940	5379420	Of Moriarty who it turns out she learned about
5379820	5386500	somehow and asked to meet five years ago and got recordings of for this test that she planned years in advance and also possibly
5387020	5390820	Programmed Moriarty to want to play with Sherlock herself all those years ago
5390820	5394460	But you'll never really know because the writers seemingly neither know nor care
5394500	5400340	There are plenty of plot holes in this episode for how a character knew something or how they knew something could possibly have happened years
5400340	5402860	In advance or any of the choices that they made
5403100	5406260	But at this point the writers can write it off with well
5406260	5411740	They're geniuses and they're attuned to every data point and they know everything and they're so much smarter than you the viewer
5411900	5418580	Making the characters this amazingly intelligent gives the writers a get-out-of-jail-free card from having to justify or explain
5419180	5424860	Anything in a tangible way that a normal person could follow and the answer is fuck you
5424860	5431420	They're smart the episode ends with the revelation that Sherlock has yet another blocked person in his memory a double secret person
5431460	5433460	he extra forgot a
5433460	5440460	Childhood friend who he remembers as a dog. One of the things that characterizes the home stories is that we know
5441260	5443260	Virtually nothing about Sherlock Holmes
5443260	5450540	and I'm curious if Benedict and Stephen and Mark Gatiss spent any time on the backstory of
5451340	5454500	Sherlock and Mycroft and their antecedents
5455180	5459540	No, I don't think you know a character by creating a backstory for them
5459540	5464620	We sometimes speculate because we're interested in you chat about it what his parents were like what he did
5464620	5470220	But you know what? We're not it's it's sacred turf. You don't you don't mess that up
5470220	5473660	You don't you don't bring that into the show. It's not right
5473780	5475940	There are some things we don't know about Sherlock Holmes
5476060	5480900	Just as there are some things we don't know about our friends and we don't ever know them and then that's right and proper
5480900	5484060	I think if we went and did something like in a way the audience wouldn't believe it
5484060	5486980	It's a now you've made that bit up. Okay, I'm gonna be honest here
5486980	5493900	I was just looking through old interview footage to find b-roll to use for a later section where I talk more about Moffat and
5494100	5502140	Accidentally stumbled upon this smoking gun where Moffat's like if we decide to stop and get into Sherlock's backstory
5502860	5509900	Maybe we're doing something wrong. This interview did not age well and also Eurus made up the girl on the plane
5509900	5514900	He was trying to save the whole episode and then Sherlock hugs her because at this point
5514900	5521020	It's easier than figuring out what she actually wants or why she did it and plays of the violin until she's happy
5521580	5522980	the end
5522980	5527540	It's actually pretty believable that fans who stuck with this episode all the way through would assume
5527700	5530180	This episode was some kind of fake trick
5530300	5536220	This season is so bad killing off the most interesting addition to the story so far adding in not one
5536220	5542540	But two secret forgotten people constantly parading Moriarty around as if he's just on the fringes about to come back
5542540	5547220	But actually he's basically not in it at all that basically everyone thinks it's utter shite
5547220	5551380	The saddest thing is even though I could talk the longest about the problems of season 4
5551660	5555220	Nobody needs me to tell them that season 4 is bad. You know the first three seasons
5555220	5561540	they're only really bad if you care about the Sherlock mythos or are paying attention or want a compelling story or
5562340	5568060	like to think about things, you know, you can turn your brain off and have a pretty fun time watching Benedict Cumberbatch and
5569060	5571060	It's Martin McBacon
5571100	5573900	talk about the stuff they're doing and
5575060	5581180	Watch the camera spin season 4 is so bad that you don't need to perform any analysis whatsoever to recognize how shite it is
5581900	5588180	So I'm basically out of a job. Like I said, the backlash isn't just a reaction to this season though. It's more than that
5588300	5590300	It's a reaction to the deeper
5590380	5596540	Realization this season brings about the entire show if there's one thing this show was always good at one thing Moffat as a writer
5596540	5601900	Always did it's keep you thinking an explanation was coming that the show was going to get good
5601940	5606820	The main way he does this is with cliffhangers and endings that suddenly imply more is going on
5606940	5612780	The show's bread-and-butter is revealed to have always been implying the show is about to turn out to be deep
5613300	5620300	Implying characterization and backstory that's way more interesting than what ends up on the screen after four seasons and a special of implying
5620700	5626580	People started to realize they were being played the drug of this manipulative writing style started to wear off
5626980	5631060	Fans of the series have been pretty rough on season 4 and while it deserves all of it
5631060	5633340	The preceding show deserved a lot of it too
5633340	5640140	But because they hadn't yet realized they were being played people thought those ones were better. Well, sorry go back and check
5640340	5644420	This is why I brought up the secret good fourth Sherlock episode theory
5644540	5650820	Because the show has rung a dozen hours of content out of telling you the audience all about future good episodes
5650820	5656020	But you don't actually get to see instead of giving you any the fans who want that new episode
5656100	5660380	Simply take more seriously than anyone else the promise they were made by this show
5660380	5665060	Which by the way is increasingly difficult to do because of the show's very clear
5665140	5669900	Attitude to the people who want to think about it if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes stories
5670140	5674780	Stephen Moffat and his co-writers hate you if you're a fan of Sherlock the show
5675180	5679820	Moffat wants you dead if you actually want to understand what is happening in the story
5680220	5682900	Stephen Moffat calls you a stupid piece of shit
5683260	5687180	Repeatedly in the show this hatred doesn't just manifest in
5687380	5693380	Insulting wankery like having it turn out to be a fucking boomerang or in deliberately rewriting one of the first
5693860	5699100	Proto-feminist icons in crime fiction to be a sexy kung-fu dominatrix in love with the main character
5699100	5704900	But in how the show directly tells you that if you're a fan, you should personally go and fuck yourself
5705340	5709080	When they reveal a couple of minutes after killing him that Sherlock's still alive
5709260	5715540	They purposefully don't explain how he survived so that people could speculate about it for the years leading into season 3
5715540	5716300	But guess what?
5716300	5717660	They never explain it
5717660	5718220	in fact
5718220	5725100	season 3 features several characters whose sole job is to portray fan theories and theorists and make fun of them and call them stupid for
5725100	5730500	Bothering to try and figure out what happened based on the information given to them by the show now
5730500	5734300	I just want to be clear on something a lot of the theories about how Sherlock survived were dumb
5734380	5738940	Not as dumb as the secret good extra season 4 episode theory, but dumb
5739100	5743060	However, the people coming up with these elaborate theories are the true fans of the show
5743100	5750740	They're the real audience the people who care enough to push through the stupid plotting and lack of real mysteries because Sherlock solves them with magic
5750740	5752740	To actually try and piece things together
5753100	5760300	People trying to figure out the mystery of the mystery story are presented as a little club of weirdos being weird together
5760540	5766300	the creator of the story appears to be so fundamentally incapable of recognizing how to tell a
5766380	5770580	Mystery that he's perceived people treating it like one as insane
5770660	5777300	They even have one of the perspective theories be that Holmes and Moriarty were gay lovers who faked it together and even the other
5777420	5779180	Theorists make fun of her for that
5779180	5783660	even though the same people writing this scene to make fun of that are also the people who
5783820	5789460	Purposefully queer baited the fuck out of the relationships between Holmes and Watson and Holmes and Moriarty
5789460	5795060	They spend a huge chunk of this episode literally calling people stupid for reading into the story's clear
5795460	5800900	Intentional subtext instead of you know, writing better text first off
5800900	5805820	I want to say give a shout out to all of my UK tumblr friends for staying up very late to watch this right now
5807300	5809300	um
5809300	5816140	The episode resolves with the main theorist played by a Lindybeige impersonator being told by Sherlock what he actually did
5816180	5822900	But then maybe it turns out Sherlock isn't there and he's losing his mind and the last we see of this character is him laughing
5823060	5828100	Maniacally with his conspiracy theory wall like a loser. Did you want to know how Sherlock did the thing?
5828100	5831580	Did you expect the story to actually tell you this is you?
5831940	5838460	Fuck you the actual correct answer that's positioned by John Watson is that you're not supposed to care
5838460	5844900	I don't care how you faked it Sherlock. I want to know why it doesn't matter how he did it
5844900	5851320	You should only care about why you're not supposed to care how a thing happened in a fucking
5852220	5853740	fucking crime
5853740	5855700	mystery story
5855700	5860740	Literally a fucking series of books about figuring out how things happen
5860740	5862740	and
5864380	5869940	This shit this shit like with the boomerang scene or the I did a bunch of stuff
5869940	5874920	You don't know about scene is a blatant disregard for the core appeal of crime
5875380	5877840	mystery stories heck stories
5877840	5885300	It's so disgustingly wrong on almost every level and so hateful towards people for expecting things to make sense
5885300	5889420	And trying to form a theory out of what they were shown that it's almost avant-garde
5889860	5893660	Instead of bothering to use the couple of hours they get every two years
5894220	5899420	They get to tell a compelling story. They're basically calling people who like the show
5900020	5903820	Stupid for thinking about it that takes balls
5904340	5909500	Moffat and Gant is a seemingly above the idea of people wanting to solve the mystery
5909500	5917020	They're being presented with because they're so far up their own asses writing about clever people who just know and you're supposed to accept
5917020	5918660	That as a story
5918660	5924860	They solve it because they're smart and that's not even getting into the sheer contempt for the source material
5925180	5930460	Rewriting one of the most interesting characters in the mythos and one of the few people who ever beats Sherlock
5930460	5935020	So that she's not interesting because she's just the villain and then doesn't beat him is
5935700	5941220	Apocalyptically bad, but it's just a tip of a gigantic iceberg made of frozen
5941220	5943140	We in the hounds of Baskerville
5943140	5950180	they're too special to simply have a big dog people are scared of and a local legend being abused so someone can claim an
5950180	5951860	Inheritance by offing their relatives
5951860	5960020	No that world famous story on the UK's best-loved novel list the best Holmes novel ever written as rated by Sherlock fans
5960100	5967740	Was too dumb and simple and understandable what it really needed was a drug that makes you hallucinate and a secret government research facility and
5967740	5970300	Pointless intrigue with Sherlock sneaking into a facility
5970300	5974020	He could easily have asked his fucking brother to let him into which he does later anyway
5974020	5978180	And the only reason there's a hound in the story at all is because the word hound
5978820	5982820	Happened to be written on the killers shirt when he killed a kid's father
5982820	5987700	So the kid hallucinated a giant dog and yet while they're trying to gussy up this
5987940	5991380	Famous story to make it more cleverer with this bullshit
5991380	5996660	They don't even bother explaining why the killer didn't just kill the only witness to his fucking crime
5996900	6000660	There's this core mismatch in the sensibility of the story's authors
6000660	6003620	They don't just hate you for wanting to solve a mystery
6004140	6011340	They seemingly hate mystery stories themselves for being too understandable having too many simple pleasures like
6011580	6013580	Watching a story unfold
6013620	6019140	Moffat and Gatiss decided that shit wouldn't fly anymore and it had to be fixed by over
6019380	6025940	Complicating it and adding in a secret facility. I wonder if Moffat's made this fucking mistake in an adaptation before
6026500	6030340	Rache, German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us something. Yes. Thank you for your input
6031140	6035780	Find out who Rachel is. She was writing Rachel. No, she was leaving an angry note in German
6035860	6037380	Of course she was writing Rachel
6037380	6043460	Oh, wow, they straight up have Sherlock dismiss the twist from the original story as being stupid and for idiots great
6044000	6046000	Thanks
6048580	6050980	Listen Steve, I know you're listening because
6051260	6056540	What else you're gonna be doing with your fucking time now that you're not running Doctor Who and probably not gonna get another season of
6056540	6062540	This if you think you're too smart for the simple pulpy crime stories that make up a famous property
6062540	6069580	You're adapting and you think they need to be fixed. Why are you adapting them in the first place the Sherlock fandom?
6069580	6074020	the people who make gifts of all the romantic moments between Sherlock and Watson with the
6074180	6078660	Saturation slightly raised to make the image pop and also fix the show's own shit
6078660	6084820	Wank color grading the people who actually believe enough pieces of the puzzle are there to explain how Sherlock survived
6085140	6090300	the people who actually liked the show enough to not believe season 4 was as bad as it was and
6090420	6094180	There had to be an episode that explained why it was pretending to be shit
6094340	6100460	The only people who will stick with Sherlock all the way through and actually profess to enjoying it are these people
6100460	6106860	These people fully believe the promise of the show that it really will one day be good and smart and pull back the curtain to
6106860	6110620	Reveal an amazing true narrative kept hidden all this time that had always been there
6110620	6116260	It's so easy to make fun of people for coming up with that silly theory. In fact, I've done that and you should too
6116300	6123940	It's stupid, but it's honest. It's the truest expression of being told over and over that something was coming. It's gonna get good
6123940	6126660	There's a real secret thing going on in the background
6126660	6129420	All these people did was take that seriously
6129700	6135220	But in reality, they were simply lied to the reality is a show that keeps telling you
6135220	6141580	I know it's bad, but I promise eventually it'll get good or turn out to have always been smart after four seasons
6141580	6143420	It's just a bad show
6143420	6148340	The old books and serials were designed to keep you reading or watching and coming back for more
6148500	6153980	When Sherlock went over the Reichenbach Falls with Moriarty and the final problem threatened to live up to its name
6154180	6156180	There was a public outcry
6156180	6163340	people wanted more their appetite fed by the format of the story and love for the character a full decade later still
6163740	6169500	Hounded pardon the pun by fans of his greatest work who still didn't care that much for his historical novels
6169860	6171060	Doyle had no choice
6171060	6178300	But to have Holmes return the new show kills Sherlock and within a few minutes of mourning him tells you it's okay
6178460	6183340	He's fine. No one would clamor for this Sherlock's resurrection a decade later
6183620	6187260	They had to make sure you knew he wasn't really dead
6187460	6192700	Because otherwise you wouldn't have given a shit about a next series and would have moved on with your life
6192860	6196420	They needed you to be speculating for years about how he did it
6196620	6200460	Even though later they planned on telling you you were a fucking idiot for doing it
6200460	6204100	It's been ten years since Jekyll came out and ended on a cliffhanger
6204460	6208500	Is anyone hounding Moffat to bring back that beloved story?
6208660	6209180	No
6209180	6216740	It's not beloved Moffat is handing off the running of Doctor Who to someone else and he said in interviews that he wants to simply
6216740	6219580	Leave the show better than he found it for someone else to take over
6219820	6225540	Well, guess what Steve? We'd have all liked if you'd done that too. Doctor Who was a silly weird and
6226140	6232180	Fantastic show that went off the air in 1989 and people remembered it wanted more of it for so long
6232460	6237340	To the point that almost 20 years later people wanted the show to return
6237620	6245020	Cared about seeing what happened next like Sherlock Holmes before it the creators of Doctor Who crafted a character and series
6245020	6250740	So good so iconic that not even a long absence could kill the love for what they had made
6251100	6257220	After a few short years of running Doctor Who even Moffat can't wait to be gone
6257780	6264340	Moffat will be remembered forever for his contributions to the show when someone else ran it when he was just on the edge making the
6264340	6268540	Best bits forced to tell a complete story and deliver on the promises
6268540	6275000	He was making instead of endlessly delaying the time things get good until people realize it isn't and never will and no
6275020	6280780	One can tell him what to do because the executive producers are him his co-writer and his mother-in-law
6280980	6284820	Many of the previous Holmes adaptations are straightforwardly written and shot
6284820	6289380	There's a whole lot of flat shots of people talking the camera never turns and reveals
6289380	6292440	They actually built a set in the middle of London, and it's a dream sequence
6292620	6297180	But I would rather watch Sherlock figure things out by sitting and looking at things
6297180	6301460	We also see and deriving a better explanation than I could with the same information
6301620	6306700	Any day of the week then sit through another second of self-indulgent look at me
6306700	6309420	I'm so clever spinny camera nonsense that reveals
6309420	6314620	It was probably just a fucking boomerang the new Sherlock thinks it's so much better more
6314940	6322780	Important and smarter than the mystery stories. It's based on that it cuts out everything that defines them leaving only shameless queer baiting
6323300	6328700	Pretentious overarching stories that never arrive anywhere and the false assurance that somehow
6329260	6332340	Someday all of this will make sense and arrive at an entertaining
6332780	6337420	Conclusion that ties everything together and proves you weren't wasting all this fucking time watching it
6337420	6341100	But the sad truth is you were I'm honestly
6341980	6343620	disappointed by
6343620	6348940	this work and in a writer who I had a lot of respect for and honestly, I I
6349900	6352800	Just think that's a shame. I really do
6354420	6358020	Also Benedict Cumberbatch is a terrible actor and his face is stupid
6359700	6361700	I
6363380	6367900	Hey, thanks for watching this video all the way through to the end. I really appreciate it another thing
6367900	6372820	I really appreciate is being able to afford to take the time to make stuff like this and for that
6372820	6376740	I really have to thank in addition to the names going past the screen right now Rebecca Harold
