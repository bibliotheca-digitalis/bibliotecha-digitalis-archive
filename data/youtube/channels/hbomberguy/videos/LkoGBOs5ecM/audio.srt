1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
You already know who Sherlock Holmes is.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,240
He's one of the most famous characters in all of Western canon.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,160
He was in dozens and dozens and dozens of stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from 1891 to 1927.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,760
He's a pop-culturally important icon and a foundational figure in the crime and mystery genres of fiction

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,080
that have continued all the way to the present day.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,200
The character has been adapted and reimagined and referenced more than any other fictional character,

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,040
except, of course, for Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,360
["Aaaaaaahhh!" sound effect plays in the background.]

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,840
The character's so instantly recognizable that, if you strap a hat and coat and pipe onto a teddy bear

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,720
and put it in the window of your shop,

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,360
people will come in asking how many thousands of pounds they can give you for the Sherlock bear.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,200
["Three. Three thousands of pounds."

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
["Oh, here it is." sound effect plays in the background.]

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,560
There's many direct film adaptations, including, uh, two fun romps made by Guy Ritchie, of all people.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,120
There's a bunch of old film serials, and there's a whole bunch of famous actors who've had a turn playing him.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,440
There's multiple different television versions,

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,880
an animated series set in the 22nd century where he got frozen for hundreds of years

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,640
and also Watson is a robot for some reason,

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,440
and a Canadian children's TV series starring Sherlock's great-grandniece Shirley Holmes.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,680
["Those last two are canon. I can prove it!" sound effect plays in the background.]

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,960
And there's perhaps an uncountable amount of books, shows, films, and other properties

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,000
directly inspired by or based on the stories and characters,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,160
one of the most obvious and best in recent history being House MD,

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,440
a show I've seen all the way through multiple times, starring huge Laurie as Dr. House

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,920
and Robert Sean Leonard as Dr. James... Wilson.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,480
You get it?

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,280
And my goodness, we haven't even talked about the anime adaptations ye-

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Let's not do that.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,440
Then there are the two recent and still active television adaptations.

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,080
Elementary plays out like a police procedural in tone,

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,520
which is fitting because that type of story is arguably a natural descendant of the original genre,

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,760
and it's set in the U.S., this time with Dr. Joan Watson, played by Lucy Liu, and it's pretty good.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,680
It's not as good as House, but it's a well-put-together show and it's very... comfy.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,320
["Sigh." sound effect plays in the background.]

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
And then there's Sherlock.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,600
Sherlock is an overproduced, overwritten, over-pissed pile of garbage

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,760
and the greatest reason ever made to dodge paying your TV license.

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,600
But what's so wrong about it? And why do so many people like it?

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,280
Or rather, why did so many people think they liked it until season four came out

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,160
and everyone collectively realized it was bad and always had been?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
And why did that happen?

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,560
All these questions and more are going to be answered over the course of this primal, hallucinatory nightmare-

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
I mean, video essay.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,520
And I hope I can properly impart why this show is such a horrible travesty.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
And just to make it clear in advance,

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm going to do it without ever getting Benedict Cumberbatch's name wrong on purpose for a lazy, overused joke.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
Not even once.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,680
Okay, I'm gonna do it once.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,360
Okay, now it's out of my system.

♪ ONAGIRU NARA KONO SORA WO DAITE KAGAYAKU SHOUNEN YO SHINWA NI NARE! ♪

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,840
This isn't just the story of one bad show.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,200
Really, it's the story of the life and times of its lead writer, Stephen William Moffat.

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,480
Moffat got spat out of a hole in the ground in Paisley in 1961

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,880
with the straightforward mission of systematically destroying all of English pop culture,

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,800
and no one stopped him yet.

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, that's not fair.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,880
Moffat is himself a staple of modern English pop culture,

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,320
having written or been involved with a couple of really good shows in his life,

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,160
including Coupling, one of the more experimental, creative, and genuinely funny romantic sitcoms ever made.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,240
It's loosely based on how he met his wife, who, by the way, produced the show,

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,320
which is probably why he had so much creative freedom.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,120
Although it does raise some questions about how insular the higher-level production staff at the BBC have become.

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm sure that won't come up later.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,480
After that, during the reboot of Doctor Who,

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,400
perhaps the only other British pop cultural staple as iconic as Sherlock Holmes,

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,720
Moffat came on and wrote numerous really good episodes that are loved by the fanbase,

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,600
giving him massive critical acclaim and winning him, among other things, a Hugo Award and a BAFTA.

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,520
If you don't know what those awards are or what they mean, it's okay. No one does.

70
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
He's been a fan of Doctor Who all his life,

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,360
and in 1999, he even wrote the Doctor Who parody episode,

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,880
The Curse of Fatal Death.

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,120
Why'd you have chairs on a Dalek spaceship anyway?

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,480
Wait, we'll explain later.

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,000
This special is one of the best contributions to the series ever,

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,520
and somehow still more progressive than the real Doctor Who ever managed to be.

77
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,160
It ends with the Doctor regenerating into a woman.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Scandalous.

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Now there's a guy who should be running Doctor Who, the fanbase collectively said aloud.

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,200
His writing is scary, dramatic.

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,680
He has genuine, established comedic chops, both within and without the science fiction genre.

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,840
He might even, you know, make there be a Doctor...

83
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,680
...not played by a man.

84
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
You know, maybe.

85
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,600
And in a television miracle, the likes of which hasn't been seen before or since in science fiction,

86
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,080
when Rusty Davies stood down as showrunner, the fans got what they wanted.

["MARFAT'S THEME"]

88
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Oops.

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,960
Some of the good aspects of Marfat's writing remain,

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,880
but overall, the show is somewhat lacking something with him in the driver's seat.

91
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
There's a lot of problems, but the main one,

92
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,960
alongside him not doing the one thing it would have been really cool for him to do

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,880
the two times and soon-to-be-three the Doctor has regenerated under his watch,

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,320
is that the show is now totally dedicated to the persona of the Doctor.

95
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,400
Previously, the Doctor was the main character, yes,

96
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,800
and he was very important in the story of the canon.

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,880
He'd been around for a long time, and he knows the history of the universe almost offhand.

98
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,440
He's dabbled in events so often that writers have played this both for drama and for comedy.

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,360
["MARFAT'S THEME"]

["LIKE I SAID, ONCE"]

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,320
That once from the first episode Marfat did, by the way.

106
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,520
But ultimately, he was just a guy with his own personality and problems

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,240
who liked having adventures and was a single piece of the puzzle of every episode's story.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,640
Marfat's version of the show positions the Doctor as the central puzzle piece to complete the universe,

109
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,760
with an army of secret societies out to personally destroy the Doctor

110
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,680
because he's the most important person of all time, and special, and wow.

["He is the Doctor. He has walked to this universe for centuries untold. He has seen stars fall to dust."

112
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,880
The first episode written by Marfat with himself as showrunner ends with the Doctor winning

113
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,560
by telling the villains how cool and important and special he is,

114
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,480
and this speech scares them off.

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,800
It's all about the Doctor, instead of the stories the Doctor interacts with.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,880
The lesson here is that Marfat is a decent writer, capable of being a great one at times,

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,000
but a terrible showrunner because he believes his own hype.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,200
He's very good at implying there's something smart or deep happening

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,280
and throwing nice tidbits about the Doctor's history into the mix, like the thing about the gun factory,

120
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,720
but he's not very good at actually doing these things that are referred to.

121
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,960
And a story that consists entirely of a man running around implying he used to do cool shit is a bad story.

122
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,000
Marfat simply doesn't write in the way that's required to pace and execute a full series of television,

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,320
which leads us to the problem of him getting to do that with Sherlock.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,000
["Sherlock Holmes Theme"]

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,360
What made the original stories so popular was the fact they were self-contained.

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,200
Apart from a few scant references to other events or the year the story takes place,

127
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,720
nothing connects the Sherlock Holmes stories to each other as a singular narrative.

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,200
On top of that, Holmes and Watson don't change all that much as people over the course of all those stories.

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,680
This was hugely beneficial to the impact of the work,

130
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,160
because it meant that even though there were tons of stories,

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,800
a person could get a complete narrative without the idea that they were missing too much if they read one of them.

132
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,000
It also meant that since there wasn't a larger overarching plot that needed to be served by each individual story,

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,760
they all had their own room to breathe.

134
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,160
If all the dozens of stories had tied into each other,

135
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,760
people would have got confused and bored,

136
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,560
and it wouldn't have been as punchy as getting a series of short, complete stories that were all satisfying on their own.

137
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,800
This format survives in many adaptations.

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,720
The 40s serials, for example, don't tie into each other at all, even though there's 14 of them.

139
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,760
You can watch Sherlock Holmes and the Pearl of Death, a personal favorite,

140
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,200
and never need to see any of the others to know what's going on or feel satisfied.

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,960
And even in elementary or house, while there's narratives that run throughout the series,

142
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,040
most episodes deal with their own particular one-off mystery and don't have to be all interlinked,

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,880
so even tuning into a random episode, you feel like you've got a complete story.

144
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I think it's fair to say the episodic nature of Sherlock Holmes is key to its appeal

145
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,120
and should remain in any adaptation.

146
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,080
Sherlock takes the core concept of the storytelling of Sherlock Holmes and why it works,

147
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,680
crumples it up, hides it in one of six busts of Napoleon,

148
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,480
and then uses them as clubs to kill baby seals.

149
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,040
It opens on Watson's experiences scarring him and the murders that set up that episode's killer.

150
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,200
See, it opens on Watson because historically,

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,480
Watson is the point of view from which the audience experiences Holmes.

152
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,640
Watson is the one we actually relate to.

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,440
We must first understand Watson to understand Holmes.

154
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,400
Remember that because this is the last time it ever happens on Sherlock.

155
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Then Watson meets Holmes.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,680
He comes with him on a case and they begin to bond,

157
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,040
and almost the entire episode is focused on actually solving the crime.

158
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,720
You know, the fun mystery story?

159
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,960
Well, sort of.

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,360
About 30 minutes in, Watson is taken out of the story to meet Sherlock's brother Mycroft,

161
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,800
played by Mark Gatiss, one of the other two writers of the show from Moffat.

162
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,360
They take time, attention, and focus away from the plot of the episode at hand

163
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,600
just to let you know as early as possible that Sherlock has a brother who's around,

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
and he does stuff.

165
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,080
He keeps popping up just to sort of let you know he exists,

166
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
and he's keeping tabs on what's going on.

167
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,120
But apart from that, almost a full hour is dedicated to trying to solve the crime.

168
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,040
The first two episodes are probably the closest the show ever gets to being good

169
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
because you get a lot of long stretches

170
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,160
where the characters try to use deductive reasoning to solve a mystery.

171
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,720
It's still bullshit, for reasons we'll get into later,

172
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,040
but it's the least bullshit we're gonna get,

173
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,760
and that makes it worthy of a fucking prize.

174
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,040
But then this happens.

175
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,800
The killer, the cab driver, shows up at Sherlock's place for unknown reasons,

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,000
and then he just sort of gets into the cab.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,040
Then he takes him to an abandoned building and they play mind games

178
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,960
while he explains that he knows about Sherlock

179
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,360
because Moriarty pays him whenever he kills someone

180
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,080
and also told him about Sherlock because Moriarty knows about Sherlock and is a fan of his.

181
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
How did you find me?

182
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,880
I was warned about you.

183
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
Who warned you about me?

184
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,080
Someone out there who's noticed.

185
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,520
Who would notice me?

186
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Got yourself a fan.

187
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,000
How did you find me?

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,040
How did you find me?

189
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,720
I want a name.

190
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,120
MORIARTY!

191
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,040
Wait, what?

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,520
This—I'm tapping my table—

193
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,000
THIS is where the problems begin.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,960
Right here.

195
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,160
Everything in the entire universe of the show exists

196
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,920
to set up the inevitable confrontation between Sherlock and Moriarty,

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,280
who already knows about Sherlock and is playing games with him for fun from day one.

198
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,440
It wasn't enough to have a one-off murder mystery

199
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,960
where Sherlock figures out who the killer is and set a good tone

200
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,640
and then maybe have him come up in the future to deal with.

201
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,200
The same thing happens again with the second episode.

202
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,880
It starts out on the right foot with the opening setting up the characters for that episode,

203
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,520
but then at the end, we get this scene where it turns out the villain also works for Moriarty

204
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
and he has her killed.

205
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,360
Once again, this is completely unnecessary.

206
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,200
Not everyone bad in the world has to turn out to be working for Moriarty.

207
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,960
This to me relates two things.

208
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,640
One, lack of understanding of what makes the source material work,

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,680
and two, the creators' lack of faith in their own material.

210
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,040
The creators have taken a series of stories made famous in the first place

211
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,840
by the fundamental facts you can read them in any order

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,080
and made it into a continuous slog,

213
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,080
depicting a pitched grand battle in which most of the playing pieces you see

214
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,120
don't actually have any influence on this wider thing.

215
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,480
None of these people matter.

216
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,600
This guy doesn't matter.

217
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,320
It's all about Sherlock and Moriarty fucking with each other.

218
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,520
Sometimes in the books, Sherlock just helped a couple of people out of a jam,

219
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,560
and that was enough.

220
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,680
Adding in this big, important, grand plan undermines the investment in the actual stories.

221
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,480
A scandal in Bohemia wasn't going to be made any better

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,840
by being part of some long-running intellectual magic mind battle

223
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,680
between Sherlock and a gay supervillain.

224
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,680
So Arthur Conan Doyle didn't bother

225
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,200
and instead focused on telling one of the most popular and compelling mystery stories

226
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,520
in the entire Western fucking canon.

227
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,560
Moffat, however, seemed to have other plans.

228
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,040
The worst part is that at some point, Moffat understood this.

229
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,840
The unaired pilot of Sherlock is a version of the first episode

230
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,680
where Mycroft isn't shoehorned in

231
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,160
and the villain doesn't turn out to be funded and informed

232
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,560
by a Moriarty who already knows about Sherlock.

233
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,720
The resulting story is much stronger

234
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,800
because you get the entire episode dedicated

235
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,000
to setting up Sherlock and Watson's dynamic far better than you can

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
when you're too busy with everything else

237
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,040
and the actual crime they're solving

238
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,440
isn't undercut by already being all about Moriarty

239
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,720
and whatever the hell he's up to.

240
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,640
It gives the motivations and intentions of the episode's villain more of a weight.

241
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,520
In the pilot, Sherlock fucking around trying to be clever

242
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
gets him captured by the cab driver

243
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,920
who figures out that he's been found out and drugs him.

244
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,360
You even get a cool exchange setting up Sherlock's previous drug problems.

245
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,440
You do a lot of drugs, Sherlock Holmes?

246
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,960
Not in a while.

247
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,560
I ask because you're very resilient.

248
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,520
Most people would have passed out by now.

249
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,560
This is far better at setting up Sherlock's drug stuff

250
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,280
than having the cops be at his place looking for drugs

251
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
and mentioning he used to have a problem

252
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,960
and then he walks out and gets into the cab?

253
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,160
It's like a fucking Mad Libs Chinese telephone version of the plot of the pilot.

254
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
It's so dumb.

255
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,160
A thing to keep in mind about the pilot is that it's only an hour long.

256
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,800
I have this theory that almost any story could be improved

257
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,280
if, once the creator came to you and said they thought it was done,

258
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,080
you forced them to take out maybe 10, 15 percent.

259
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,880
It forces them to reassess the importance of what's on the screen

260
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,440
and remove indulgences that don't really add anything.

261
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,240
For example, uh, this section in the script

262
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,360
begins with, like, a 10-minute ramble about the importance of the original stories

263
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,920
but then I decided to rewrite that bit to be a tenth of the length

264
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,360
and that turned out to be way better.

265
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,640
The pilot seems to demonstrate this happening in reverse

266
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,760
where the full show was given an extra half an hour.

267
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,200
So they thought, oh, great!

268
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,400
That gives us time to insert the co-writer of the show's character early

269
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,080
and have intrigue that doesn't go anywhere

270
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,280
because he turns out to be, like, just a normal guy who's worried about his brother

271
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,880
and also connect a nice and simple first story to Moriarty for no reason!

272
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,080
I'll here restate my previous point that Moffat is a decent writer

273
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,480
who would be best utilized in one-off episodes

274
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,720
with strong direction and oversight by others

275
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,520
and not directly in charge of running an entire show

276
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,160
based on one of the most well-known properties in British history

277
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,080
like in Doctor Who or in Sh—

278
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,800
Jekyll!

279
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,280
Oh, you thought I'd forgotten about Jekyll, didn't you, Steve?

280
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Well, I can't blame you.

281
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Most people have.

282
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,800
Jekyll is an adaptation of slash sequel thing to The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

283
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,360
made in 2007 with Moffat writing all of it

284
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,680
and executive produced by Moffat, Catherine Mitchell, and Moffat's mother-in-law.

285
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,880
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is behind Doctor Who and Sherlock Holmes,

286
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,640
maybe the one other really big English pop-cultural character we have.

287
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,520
Can we...

288
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Can we stop giving these to him, please?

289
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,160
It's six episodes and it's quite bad.

290
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,520
It's very bad in some places and surprisingly okay in others

291
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,960
but it exhibits all the same problems as Moffat's work on Doctor Who and Sherlock

292
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,640
so it's worth bringing up as an example of the wider problems with Moffat's writing.

293
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,160
The most noticeable and informative thing about the show is its pacing.

294
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,200
The show opens very strongly with Dr. Jackman,

295
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,760
uh,

296
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,000
aware that he has a condition where he manifests a very strong and dangerous personality

297
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
and working to manage it.

298
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,360
We open in media res with someone else being introduced to his techniques.

299
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,640
When I first saw the show, I couldn't be happier that Moffat didn't write

300
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,640
the three previous episodes worth of plot he could have written leading into this room

301
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,360
showing Jackman getting his condition and becoming aware of it

302
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
and working to try and find a way around it.

303
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,680
Finding out exactly how the transformation works

304
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,160
and the state of his life and the people in it over the course of the first episode is mostly great,

305
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,040
excluding the bad writing and editing in some places,

306
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,480
but it ends super strong with the viewer interested in what's going to happen next

307
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,920
with Hyde learning that Jackman has a family he's been keeping secret from him

308
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,080
and Jackman getting pretty pissed about that.

309
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,720
Come to my family again, and you and I are at war.

310
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,440
It's a good pilot, and it sells you on the story and the conceit of the transformation very well.

311
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,360
The first episode's clever in places, like with Hyde initially not having a name

312
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,320
and deciding to call himself Billy after kicking a guy's ass and deciding to literally take his name.

313
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,080
Then it gets more intriguing with him meeting someone who addresses him as Mr. Hyde

314
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,360
and referring openly to the actual story the show's based on.

315
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,400
It's a clever twist.

316
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,600
You start out thinking the show's a modern reimagining of the story,

317
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,400
but then it turns out, no, the original book still exists.

318
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,040
It's genuinely entertaining watching the cogs turn and the narrative do unexpected things like that.

319
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,560
But after the first episode, the show immediately begins to fall apart.

320
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,040
It turns out that the Jekyll in the original stories was a real person who also existed

321
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,520
and had the same condition as Jackman, and also they exactly resemble each other.

322
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,200
There's also a secret organization bent on making super soldiers out of Hyde's advanced physiology,

323
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,840
a mystery regarding how Jackman came to exist because Jekyll died a virgin.

324
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,280
Henry Jekyll died of— Henry Jekyll didn't have any—

325
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
Do you get it?

326
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,120
An unrelated mystery about human cloning that sort of comes in out of nowhere and, by the way, isn't

327
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,880
the resolution of the why Jackman exists and looks exactly like Jekyll plot

328
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,720
because Moffat felt like being clever.

329
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
Hyde starts screaming,

330
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,480
Why am I not a superman like a tiny baby?

331
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,000
And Jackman and Hyde merge their personalities.

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,080
And all the electricity turns off and he has mind powers and—

333
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,360
Oh, and for some reason, a bunch of characters and lines that could have been ripped whole cloth

334
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,280
from coupling start turning up in this horror drama four episodes in.

335
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,280
But the show even commits, in my opinion based on what I liked about it,

336
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
the cardinal sin.

337
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
It shows the backstory.

338
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,840
The fourth episode is almost entirely long flashbacks showing Jackman gaining the condition

339
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,480
and starting to discover it and figure out how to manage it.

340
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
That's right.

341
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,480
Moffat starts in media res, smartly skipping explaining an origin story that's not necessary

342
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,920
for getting to the interesting bits that take place in the first episode

343
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,560
and then goes back to explain it.

344
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,680
The show ends with Jackman's mother, who has appeared intermittently,

345
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,560
suddenly transforming into the lady who runs the organization that's trying to study Hyde.

346
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,800
It's a twist intended to set up a second series and its own deeper mysteries or whatever,

347
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,240
but the show was cancelled, so we'll never find out what happens next,

348
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,680
why Jackman's mother's alter ego was trying to study Hyde in the first place

349
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
given she could have just studied herself,

350
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,600
why Jekyll is so goddamn important,

351
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,040
or how the company got so big and rich and powerful over the course of 100 years

352
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,840
when it's run by a woman who couldn't have been around for more than 60 of them

353
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,040
and all their money was revealed to have come from studying imperfect clones of Jekyll

354
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,720
and their cloning was only achieved in the 50s,

355
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,320
so how did they get the riches required to learn to fucking clone humans before then?

356
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,040
And it turns out that love is what made Jekyll become Hyde in the first place

357
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,240
because there is no potion!

358
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,040
So they even ruined the premise of the original fucking book!

359
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,960
Most importantly, the key word I would associate with Jekyll is promise.

360
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,760
Jekyll has, for all its faults, a very strong pilot episode

361
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,800
and honestly, Moffat should just write pilot episodes for the rest of his life

362
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,280
and then hand the rest of the series off to other writers

363
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
to play on the interesting ideas he brings up

364
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,200
and then abandons while trying to be smart

365
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,680
or outsmart the source material.

366
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,280
Moffat desperately needs people slapping his wrists away from the keyboard

367
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
when he decides to write an episode of backstory

368
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,320
to a show that started strong specifically by not having any.

369
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,560
So we're left with two pilots penned by Moffat

370
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,760
which both promise really interesting and good shows and work

371
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
basically all the way through on their own level

372
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,600
but then the actual shows in question fail to live up to any of those ideas.

373
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,280
Also, I kind of have to bring this up,

374
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,920
the editing of the show is pretty bad

375
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,040
but it's clear the editors were given very little to work with.

376
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,880
Most of the fights happen off-screen.

377
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,960
Here's the scene where Hyde throws a guy out a window.

378
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,260
Cheers.

379
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,640
They play a glass smashing sound effect before cutting

380
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,560
and then it cuts to him getting off the ground.

381
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,880
They simply didn't shoot the money shot of this scene

382
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,040
of the guy actually getting thrown through the window.

383
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,680
The editor had to really stretch the shots they had

384
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,480
to make the scene have any continuity whatsoever

385
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,880
and you can almost feel the editor's anger

386
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,000
at whoever decided not to shoot most of the interesting events

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,440
called for in the script.

388
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
By far the funniest part of the show is this outtake

389
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,840
an editor left in that nobody seemed to notice

390
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,720
where Hyde uses his superpowers to pull out a book of matches

391
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,920
and light one out of nowhere

392
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,720
but Nesbitt accidentally flings the entire pack directly into his face and eyes.

393
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
They try and cut away but all they can cut to

394
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,640
is this other angle of him doing the same thing.

395
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,800
It's like, wow, do you have a take

396
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,920
where he doesn't throw the matches into his face?

397
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,620
No?

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,480
Oh, well, we have to go with this then.

399
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,880
Actually, considering the way a lot of the show plays out

400
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,720
and the lack of coverage everywhere else,

401
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,520
I'm willing to bet they didn't even shoot a second take at all.

402
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,680
I've spent so long laboring on Jekyll,

403
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,600
well, partially because I watched six hours of it

404
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,480
preparing for this video and wanted to justify the wasted time,

405
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,240
but also because it's very much a blueprint

406
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,400
for a lot of the mistakes in Sherlock's writing.

407
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,880
What Moffat's really good at is telling single stories

408
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,000
that have to start and then end conclusively

409
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,320
because you're never gonna see most of these characters

410
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,840
or even this planet again.

411
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
You can't just set up the next season

412
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
with a hackneyed cliffhanger or whatever.

413
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,560
You have to end the story satisfyingly.

414
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,600
It needs a big, strong idea every week.

415
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,640
I think you know you've got a good idea for a Doctor Who story

416
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,400
if you think, well, I've just blown that feature film idea forever, haven't I?

417
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,720
Right.

418
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,800
That's the size of story that gets you through 45 minutes of Doctor Who.

419
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,560
Compare and contrast the writing of this scene

420
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
from The Empty Child in season one.

421
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,800
The Doctor follows a mysterious Mauve object

422
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
through time as it crashes on Earth

423
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,320
and, assuming it would have made an impression,

424
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,600
decides to ask the locals

425
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,120
if they've seen something fall from the sky.

426
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,600
It might seem like a stupid question,

427
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,400
but has anything fallen from the sky recently?

428
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,840
That's a weird response.

429
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,360
He doesn't get it and neither do you.

430
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,480
What's going on?

431
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,320
And then an air raid siren goes off

432
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,640
and he sees the wartime posters and you go,

433
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh, it's the war!

434
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,800
This is a clever and simple setup and reveal.

435
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,040
Over the course of the episode and the second part,

436
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,360
we learn what the ship was, what it does,

437
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,640
what's happened in London,

438
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,000
and by the end of these two episodes,

439
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
you have a complete picture of what happened and why.

440
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Also, a guy's face gets turned into a gas mask by nanomachines

441
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
and it's the scariest thing anyone my age

442
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,880
has ever seen in their entire lives.

443
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
There's good writing and a good story here

444
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,560
with a conclusion that feels earned.

445
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,760
Moffat's supposedly famous for writing the more dark episodes,

446
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,040
but at the end of this one,

447
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,160
everyone who has died comes back to life.

448
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,600
Like, he un-kills people

449
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
and yet the tone carries it,

450
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
makes it feel dark even then.

451
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,360
That's just how good he is

452
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,280
when he's given a single story to tell.

453
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,520
But when Moffat has to write the whole series

454
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,360
and manage the wider progression,

455
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,640
you start to see holes.

456
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,520
Things start being implied that sound deep,

457
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,680
seem like they might be going somewhere,

458
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,880
but actually don't.

459
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,560
His first season starts with the Doctor

460
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,000
finding a crack in space and time

461
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,880
on the bedroom wall of a girl he happens to run into,

462
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,240
and then the cracks keep turning up

463
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,080
and a piece of the TARDIS comes through one.

464
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,600
Where did the cracks come from?

465
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,520
Keep watching and maybe you'll find out.

466
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,040
Then it turns out they come from the TARDIS

467
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,560
exploding at the end of the season.

468
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,480
But why did the TARDIS explode?

469
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,320
Keep watching and maybe you'll find out.

470
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, the silence did it?

471
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,400
Maybe. I'm still not clear.

472
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,440
Why did they do it?

473
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,200
Well, keep watching and maybe you'll find out.

474
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,960
Oh, they did it because there's a prophecy

475
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,400
that silence must fall when the question is asked.

476
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,680
Who made this prophecy,

477
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,120
and what the hell does it mean?

478
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,200
Keep watching for yet another fucking season

479
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,000
and maybe...

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,880
Bzzzzt....

481
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,640
It also feels like Moffat really did use up

482
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,680
all his feature film ideas

483
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,440
because he brings back the Weeping Angels

484
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,400
for a two-part episode

485
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,080
and then they come back again later,

486
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,760
even more.

487
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,840
In the first series, which is still my favorite,

488
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,600
they would have the Doctor do something shitty

489
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,120
like torture a Dalek,

490
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,280
and he would have to confront himself that episode

491
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,720
and get better as a person.

492
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,640
Say what you want about Russell T. Davies,

493
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,600
but under his watch,

494
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,680
almost every episode would feel involving

495
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,520
because characters would change or grow

496
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,880
or have to actually confront

497
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,720
and deal with something about themselves.

498
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,160
Why don't you finish the job

499
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,920
and make the Daleks extinct?

500
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,680
Rid the universe of your filth!

501
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
Rid the universe of your filth!

502
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,160
Why don't you just die?!

503
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,960
You would make a good Dalek.

504
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,600
This episode explores the Doctor's anger at the Daleks

505
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,080
and shows it's an expression of seeing his entire race

506
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,360
die in a war with them.

507
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,640
Over the course of this episode,

508
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,480
he has to confront these feelings

509
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,920
in ways he hasn't let himself

510
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
and grow as a person.

511
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,640
It's a really small change,

512
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,320
but we get to see it happen,

513
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,280
and it's good.

514
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,600
In contrast, here's a superficially similar scene

515
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,720
in a Moffat-run season

516
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,560
in an episode co-written by Moffat.

517
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,560
You are a good Dalek.

518
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,920
This happens at the end of an episode.

519
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,440
The purpose of this scene

520
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,680
is to tell you that the Doctor is full of hatred.

521
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,920
Not so we can deal with that hatred being there

522
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
in the actual story of the episode

523
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,080
or explore these emotions in more detail,

524
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,760
but to make you watch the next episode

525
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,000
to see if maybe they'll eventually deal

526
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
with the interesting thing

527
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,560
they brought up and did nothing with.

528
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,560
I see into your soul, Doctor.

529
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,040
I see hatred!

530
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh, I've looked into your soul.

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,680
I see hatred, Doctor.

532
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,000
Hatred that a future episode

533
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,720
might eventually fucking deal with and be interesting.

534
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Do you have it in you to murder me?

535
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,120
Did he push you out of that thing?

536
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,560
Or did you fall?

537
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,080
Couldn't really tell.

538
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,520
You can be very mean sometimes.

539
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,080
We get it.

540
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,160
The Doctor's an ambiguous character now.

541
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,920
Are you gonna explore that in more detail

542
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,520
or are you just gonna keep telling us that?

543
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,400
For all his flaws,

544
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,480
Davies tried to make each episode

545
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,240
have a satisfying complete story

546
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,680
and arc for its characters.

547
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm the only one left.

548
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,180
I win.

549
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,400
How about that?

550
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Moffat, as a showrunner,

551
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,520
tries to make each episode imply

552
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,880
something satisfying is maybe gonna happen eventually.

553
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,200
You can have all the fantastic premises you like,

554
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,400
shrinking yourself down to go inside a Dalek to do surgery,

555
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,040
having a sword fight with Robin Hood with a spoon,

556
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,840
having to go on a space bank heist with strangers,

557
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,400
whatever,

558
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
but if most of the time the conclusion is,

559
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,160
wow, you've got some anger, Doctor,

560
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,560
I bet a future episode might bother to deal with it,

561
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,280
those episodes are wasting a lot of their potential.

562
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,840
Again, this is something Moffat grasped excellently

563
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,600
when he was writing one-off episodes.

564
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,840
Blink starred characters that were never seen before

565
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,120
and haven't been seen since,

566
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
but it has a complete emotional arc

567
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,680
for its main characters over the course of one episode.

568
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,120
It doesn't end with someone saying,

569
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,920
wow, you have problems you probably ought to deal with at some point.

570
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,840
Tune in next week to see if we do.

571
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,240
The problem is, when you come down to it,

572
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,400
Doctor Who is about visiting other worlds

573
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,840
and going on fun adventures.

574
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Moffat made it all about the Doctor.

575
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,760
In much the same way,

576
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,160
the Sherlock Holmes stories are about solving crimes

577
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,000
and fun mysteries and figuring things out

578
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,280
using deductive reasoning.

579
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,400
Moffat made his show all about Sherlock.

580
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,880
Sherlock is too important, too special, too powerful,

581
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,560
and this ruins the tension of the show

582
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,720
and our ability to empathize with the character.

583
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,520
The entire show is dedicated to telling you about Sherlock

584
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,040
instead of showing you Sherlock

585
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,440
by way of his interaction with the actual plot.

586
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,640
Season 1 was the only season that came close to getting this right,

587
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,120
where you learned what sort of person he was and his abilities

588
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
based on how he used them in the episode.

589
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,280
As the show progresses, the actual mystery,

590
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,800
you know, the crimes we're supposed to have fun watching Sherlock solve,

591
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
take a back seat to the show telling us

592
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,720
how cool and wacky Sherlock is

593
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,880
and his mind battle with Moriarty.

594
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,400
In this episode in Season 3,

595
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,120
there's a huge setup just for Sherlock being weird.

596
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,840
They spend a pretty sizable portion of the runtime and budget

597
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,960
for a quick joke about how rude and thoughtless Sherlock is

598
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
while Lestrade is gearing up to capture someone

599
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,880
who's clearly been a problem with him for a long time.

600
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,040
I-I-I have to go.

601
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,800
Are there any funny stories about John?

602
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,480
They could have just made him rude and thoughtless

603
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,080
over the course of the plot of the actual fucking episode.

604
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,320
The punchline of these jokes is supposed to set up something

605
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,600
regarding the principal characters,

606
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,000
but they do it so poorly and in such a roundabout way

607
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,800
that they're neither funny nor really tell us anything new.

608
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,520
We should already know Sherlock is a big inconsiderate piece of shit

609
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,440
because Moffat has been writing him as one

610
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,040
for three seasons at this point.

611
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,880
This kind of overindulgent nonsense

612
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,600
is antithetical to actually telling an interesting story.

613
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,080
Nothing remotely like this would have happened in the short stories

614
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,760
because they actually had a story worth telling

615
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,120
and wanted to get to it.

616
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,680
Cumulatively, stuff like this reduces the entire show

617
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,280
to Sherlock prancing around showing off how smart and or rude he is

618
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,880
and very occasionally pausing to do something.

619
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,840
I'll get hung for this.

620
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,040
No, no, no, Mr. Pirk, not at all.

621
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240
Hanged?

622
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,200
Yes.

623
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,880
Sherlock corrects a guy's grammar a bunch

624
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,520
for the first two minutes of this episode and then walks away.

625
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,960
This doesn't serve the story at all

626
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,840
except to tell us that Sherlock doesn't like when you say words wrong,

627
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,320
which is, you know, an admirable character trait, obviously.

628
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,800
Fuck that guy. He deserves to die even if he didn't do the murder.

629
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,160
But it's really not something so pivotal as to be the start of an episode.

630
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,000
It's a show about solving crimes.

631
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,360
The episode should be starting with...

632
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,600
A crime! A thing happens that pequees your interest,

633
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,280
like the first two episodes did.

634
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,520
But by the time of the third episode,

635
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,280
we open on Sherlock being shitty,

636
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,520
dramatically walking out and the credits go,

637
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,240
and then we cut to Sherlock being shitty in his house for another three minutes.

638
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,920
Ooh, there's a head.

639
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,320
Ooh, there's a head in the fridge. How wacky.

640
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,720
The actual start of the episode's fucking plot

641
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
is at around 6 minutes 20 seconds

642
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,680
when someone suddenly attacks the house out of nowhere with a bomb.

643
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,960
Everything leading up to that is Sherlock being bored and smarmy

644
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,240
and literally waiting around for the plot to come and get him.

645
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,480
Now, this characterization isn't utterly terrible.

646
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,200
We do have a strong sense that Sherlock is a dick.

647
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,040
But the problem with this is that, in effect,

648
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,640
the entire show is bent towards providing characterization for Sherlock

649
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,440
and making the story he's interacting with take a back seat

650
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,040
until it becomes convenient.

651
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,600
In the actual books and many of the adaptations,

652
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,920
Sherlock Holmes was not the real focal point.

653
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,200
The mystery at hand and the other characters were equally as important,

654
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,880
and the point was the way Sherlock interacted with them to help solve the case.

655
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,840
Let's take the very first story, A Study in Scarlet.

656
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,440
Sherlock, while examining the body, refers to pre-existing events he's clearly studied

657
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,680
and actively recommends others do the same.

658
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Instead of simply telling everyone how smart he is,

659
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,880
he makes a tangible reference to a piece of information that could be relevant.

660
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,800
We're seeing his reasoning in action.

661
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,000
We're also getting strong characterization while the plot moves forward

662
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,920
of Sherlock checking the body

663
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,280
and making comments that teach us about Sherlock and about the case.

664
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,160
Characterization and story are happening at the same time

665
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,320
and not in separate segments for the first six minutes before the story decides to start.

666
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,400
Lestrade assumes R-A-C-H-E written in blood on a wall are meant to say Rachel

667
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,960
and the killer was disturbed before they could finish writing

668
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,240
and that someone called Rachel therefore has something to do with the case.

669
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,600
That's all he gets from this scene,

670
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
the assumption that these words might say Rachel,

671
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,440
which it turns out they don't.

672
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,520
Sherlock looks at this scene and deduces, for example,

673
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,760
the approximate height of the person who wrote the message

674
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,000
based on where it had made sense for them to write the letters.

675
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,480
Something no one else in the room thought to observe or consider

676
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,720
but something that you could absolutely arrive at yourself.

677
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,480
This is a tangible piece of information that you yourself could apply to real life.

678
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,120
Sherlock just taught you how to figure out how tall someone is

679
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
based on how they would naturally write on a wall

680
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,600
or the length of the stride of their footprints.

681
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,440
This characterization is very strong because it gets across that Sherlock is smart

682
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
but also why he's smart,

683
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,680
what he did to learn the things he learned

684
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,600
and got across the point of the scene

685
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,480
which is to demonstrate the use of his analytical techniques.

686
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,120
For comparison, there's a scene in the first Sherlock episode,

687
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,240
a study in pink,

688
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,200
ooh, do you get it?

689
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,840
How clever!

690
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,960
where Sherlock goes to a crime scene clearly based on the one from Scarlet.

691
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,200
Rach here is written by the victim

692
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,720
and it actually turns out that she really is trying to write the name Rachel

693
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,240
because knowing German, I guess, is too much to expect of an audience.

694
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,320
This isn't necessarily a bad change.

695
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,240
What is a bad change is what information Sherlock learns and how he learns it.

696
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,520
We're shown Sherlock inspecting the body and instead making the conclusion,

697
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,560
based on the inside of a dirty wedding ring being clean,

698
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,400
that the woman is a serial adulterer.

699
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,040
This actually doesn't have very much impact on the story whatsoever,

700
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,880
it's just the writers finding a way to be clever

701
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,680
by having Sherlock derive an entire sexual history from a ring.

702
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,680
He then realizes something no one else notices and dramatically runs off screaming,

703
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,280
PINK!

704
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
This is tonally, utterly wrong.

705
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Instead of being given tangible explanations

706
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,480
and the intrigue coming from deciding what to do next with the information

707
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,600
in order to catch the killer,

708
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,720
you're told to assume someone's marriage is failing because their ring is dirty

709
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
and that Sherlock knows something you don't

710
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
and has just run off to deal with it himself.

711
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,120
The tone here is utter confusion.

712
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,200
Sherlock's smart because he figured something out,

713
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,320
but we're not gonna say what or how or why.

714
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,120
Just for contrast,

715
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,560
the first time we see CBS's elementaries Sherlock on a crime scene,

716
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,920
he discovers a hidden room by feeling the incline of the floor with his feet.

717
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,360
The extra weight of the Saffron steel reinforcements

718
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,680
can cause the floor around it to decline slightly,

719
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,520
creating a slope between one and five degrees.

720
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
This thing with the marble is clever

721
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,440
and based on quite simple available information,

722
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,640
like that big armored panic rooms are heavy.

723
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,760
It's not rocket science,

724
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,440
but it's a believable deduction

725
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,360
and it did just teach you an actual real-life way of finding hidden panic rooms.

726
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,800
This show might not be perfect,

727
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,520
but at least they...

728
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,400
solve crimes?

729
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Using information they detected?

730
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,480
Like detectives would?

731
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,000
This early scene is the best analysis in the show you're gonna get, too.

732
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,120
You are shown pieces of information that lead to a conclusion.

733
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,160
For example, he recognizes that she would have had to have a suitcase with her

734
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,200
because of splash marks,

735
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,240
which the viewers even shown and has a chance to figure out for themselves

736
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,520
before Sherlock explains it.

737
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,600
But in most investigations after this one,

738
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,760
Sherlock starts either making wild assumptions

739
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,520
that don't have any basis in reality

740
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,720
or straight-up learns key information the viewer isn't even told about.

741
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,440
In episode two,

742
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,560
Sherlock assumes a man found with a gunshot on the right side of his head

743
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,120
couldn't be self-inflicted because he was left-handed.

744
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,560
The wound's on the right side of his head.

745
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:07,800
And?

746
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,160
Vancombe is left-handed.

747
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

748
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,480
This isn't even a solid assumption.

749
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,920
In practice, plenty of left-handed people use their other hand for firearms

750
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,200
so that the kickback of the weapon

751
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,760
doesn't potentially injure the hand you use for writing with,

752
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
including, say, for example,

753
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,560
John Watson.

754
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,760
Bing.

755
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,480
In episode three,

756
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,360
Sherlock has to figure out how a TV personality lady was poisoned.

757
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,640
He sends Watson to the lady's house

758
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,160
and we get scenes of him checking stuff out

759
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,840
and Sherlock starting to watch a few episodes

760
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,200
and check the internet for theories.

761
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,680
The characters meet up and Sherlock just sort of throws out there

762
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,400
that the houseboy who is in a relationship with the lady's brother

763
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,680
probably poisoned her in revenge for mistreatment of the brother on TV

764
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,600
based on all the research he did off-screen.

765
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,600
All we see of this research is her patting him a little bit too hard on the back.

766
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,680
Sherlock proves this theory by having a toxicology report come in

767
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,360
and show it was botulinum toxin

768
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,680
and that the houseboy's job was to give her Botox

769
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,840
and that he knows he's been bulk-ordering it.

770
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,000
My contact at the home office gave me the complete records

771
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,280
of Raoul's internet purchases.

772
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,120
He's been bulk-ordering Botox for months.

773
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,400
Buy it at his time, then up the strength to a fatal dose.

774
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,040
That's right.

775
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,880
In a show about solving crimes

776
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,440
and giving the viewer a sense of unfolding mystery

777
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,880
and maybe giving them some information

778
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,280
so they can try and figure it out themselves as they go

779
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,960
so, you know, their brain is engaged.

780
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,280
Sherlock solves the crime off-screen using information the viewer has never shown

781
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,680
or even has a chance to deduce for themselves.

782
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,240
He just comes out of nowhere and reveals it was Botox

783
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,440
and that he has a friend with the power to find out people's internet purchases

784
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,480
and share them with him.

785
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,760
The ability to be intelligent in finding and interpreting available information

786
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,280
is replaced with a superpower

787
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,560
where he holds all the cards and knows more than the viewer possibly could,

788
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,360
rendering the experience of trying to follow the story

789
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,320
roughly similar to trying to figure out where a car is driving

790
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,600
while there's a bag over your head

791
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,800
and Stephen Moffat is punching you and insisting he's being clever.

792
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,160
In this same episode,

793
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,520
based on a guard being found dead who works in a gallery,

794
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,240
he immediately then arrives at the conclusion

795
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,720
that a recent painting unveiled there has to be fake

796
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,880
because why else would anyone ever be killed?

797
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,200
And then he concludes based on circumstantial evidence

798
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,800
that a well-known legendary hitman we've never heard of before must have done it.

799
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,560
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.

800
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,640
That is his trademark style.

801
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,280
And then someone off-screen finds out where he is

802
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,920
and then they go to where he is.

803
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,360
Any time you want to explain?

804
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,320
Homeless network really is indispensable.

805
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,880
Like, all the deduction and thinking

806
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,960
isn't done in a way that is actually interesting or fun for the viewer to see.

807
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,880
How would a person track this hitman?

808
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,480
How would you find out where he is?

809
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
That's an interesting story.

810
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,200
They skip over it.

811
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,520
Sherlock literally hires someone else to do it

812
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,720
and they do all of this

813
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,200
so that Sherlock and Watson have an excuse to run around

814
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,280
chasing a really tall guy and then having a wrestle with him.

815
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,600
You know, yeah, the original stories were fantastic

816
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,960
and groundbreaking pieces of literature about solving mysteries

817
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,240
but what they really could have done with

818
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,880
was a bit where the main characters wrestle a tall guy for a while.

819
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
I'll say again that the show does start out better

820
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,760
and lots of season one does feature some genuine deduction

821
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,600
based on information the viewers also shown

822
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,080
but you can see the slip starting to happen here.

823
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,120
The deductive reasoning a superior show would be centrally about

824
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,720
is replaced with a conjuring trick

825
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,120
where you're told later how clever Sherlock was

826
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,800
and then he tells you about all the other stuff

827
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,560
you didn't even know about that led him to it.

828
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,760
In The Hounds of Baskerville,

829
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,680
Sherlock intentionally tries to drug Watson

830
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,560
with what he thinks is sugar that's had a hallucinogen added to it

831
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,160
based on how he thinks he's been drugged

832
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,320
and it's the only thing they didn't both consume.

833
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,640
The fact it's the one thing they haven't both eaten or drunk

834
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,120
isn't established until after Watson has been given the sugar

835
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,320
and started hallucinating.

836
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,440
The purpose of this part appears to be to make Sherlock look clever

837
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,880
for knowing something we didn't even have the chance to think about for ourselves.

838
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,640
Also, he could have just tested the sugar

839
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,600
instead of trying to drug his friend with an unknown chemical

840
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,920
to see what would happen and then testing it later

841
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,840
only to discover the sugar is clean.

842
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,160
You can even imagine a better, smarter show

843
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,080
having a section where the two stop

844
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,760
and think about everything they've eaten.

845
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,160
Maybe even cutting back to scenes of everything they ate

846
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,200
that we already saw

847
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,960
because they could have had scenes of them doing that

848
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,080
as other stuff happened

849
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,640
and eliminating everything except the sugar

850
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,760
then testing it in the lab and discovering that it's normal.

851
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,480
Instead, all this information is excised on purpose

852
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,000
so you can have the mystery

853
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,720
of Sherlock maybe drugging his only friend

854
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,240
and fill some precious time

855
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,480
as Watson hides in the lab from an imaginary dog

856
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,600
for five whole minutes.

857
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,360
The story it would have made sense to tell

858
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,840
is just too normal for Moffat and Gatiss.

859
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,080
The real focus is what wacky or cool thing

860
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,680
Sherlock will personally do

861
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,480
and then how he'll justify it later using bullshit

862
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,040
instead of being on the piece of evidence or information

863
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,600
and the proper approach to finding it and acting on it.

864
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,680
This conveniently lets the writers off the hook

865
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,320
for ever having to deal with things like character traits

866
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,480
or motivation or choices.

867
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,640
When you read a chapter of a Sherlock Holmes story,

868
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
you feel like you've gotten a little bit smarter.

869
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,000
It feels weird to say out loud

870
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,320
but often it's like you've personally seen the benefit

871
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,080
of a certain way of looking at the world.

872
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,640
Sherlock has the strongest characterization in the show

873
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,560
but, in effect, it's too strong,

874
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,160
pulling the focus away from things

875
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,800
that actually make watching him do stuff interesting

876
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,720
like the other characters and their lives

877
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,320
and the mysteries he's solving.

878
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
This is a gigantic problem

879
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,240
in both storytelling and characterization.

880
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,040
A lot of the original stories were only a few pages long.

881
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,800
There wasn't enough time to mythologize

882
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,320
what a badass Sherlock was

883
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
because there was crime to solve.

884
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,840
The 90-minute format of the show

885
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,160
seemingly gives the creators too much time.

886
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,920
Hell, the pilot was better

887
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,760
because they didn't have that extra 30 minutes

888
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,520
to shoehorn in the Mycroft stuff

889
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
and then tie it all into Moriarty

890
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,120
because why not make it all about him, too?

891
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,320
Speaking of which...

892
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,760
If you thought the show's obsession with Sherlock was too much,

893
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,520
wait until you get a load of Moriarty.

894
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,320
The entire Sherlock world has been almost completely absorbed

895
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,640
into the all-encompassing plans of some guy

896
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,160
who was in two of the many dozens of original stories.

897
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,720
After being suddenly inserted into the first two episodes

898
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,680
to let you know he's coming

899
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,760
so you have something to keep watching for

900
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,360
because the writing and mystery solving

901
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,800
certainly can't be doing that for you,

902
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,640
episode three's all weird mind games

903
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,960
explicitly for Sherlock by Moriarty.

904
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,760
It's all about a big, smart baddie messing with Sherlock

905
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,040
but in a really boring way

906
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,240
where he holds all the cards

907
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,920
and Sherlock never actually outsmarts him,

908
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,040
just solves his puzzles

909
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,840
but he solves them off-screen or using magic mind powers

910
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,000
so it's a struggle we don't even get to see.

911
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,200
There's also the problem of him being relentlessly queer-coded.

912
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,280
Okay.

913
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,880
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

914
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,080
Daddy's had enough now.

915
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,160
Seriously, this guy's just the fucking most.

916
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,120
Do you like my boys?

917
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,680
This one's got more stamina

918
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,040
but he's less caring in the afterglow.

919
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,640
What are you doing, Andrew?

920
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,760
Oh, boy.

921
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,880
Do you get it?

922
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,760
He's a queen?

923
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,480
Oh, fuck you, Steve.

924
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,600
Like, I get it.

925
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,360
He's really into Sherlock

926
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,800
and the writers imply this means he wants to do the fuck on him

927
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,120
but, like, why?

928
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,440
What does this add to the narrative?

929
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,120
Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain

930
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,480
so we thought someone who was genuinely, properly frightening.

931
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,520
Someone who's an absolute psycho, Moffat.

932
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,020
Okay.

933
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,760
Number one, absolute psycho.

934
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,960
Make him act like a gay.

935
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,520
Great, that's really fucking comforting of you.

936
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,020
Thank you.

937
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,280
Number two, Moriarty, dull and posh?

938
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:18,600
One of the most memorable fucking characters in, like, the history of literature?

939
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,200
Oh, yeah.

940
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,720
He needs to be fixed.

941
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,920
We need to make him into the fucking loudest, shoutingest, prancingest,

942
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,960
weirdest, most over-the-top guy ever.

943
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,480
Just, you know.

944
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,920
Because we really needed to fucking fix Moria—

945
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,640
You f—

946
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,840
Jesus Christ.

947
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,320
Moriarty is self-consciously a villain.

948
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,360
He knows what he's doing.

949
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,880
He's a nutcase.

950
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,120
He knows what he's doing and he's a nutcase?

951
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,840
Uh, Mark, those—

952
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,720
Those things don't—

953
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,320
See? He's an absolute psycho

954
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,480
which means the creators can have him do anything,

955
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,320
even contradictory things like

956
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,480
threaten Sherlock to try and keep him away

957
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,200
and do everything he can to protect his identity

958
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,280
and needlessly play with Sherlock up to and including fucking just killing himself

959
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,800
just to mess with his head

960
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,880
and they don't have to justify any of it

961
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,720
because he's a complete psycho.

962
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,320
He doesn't have to make any sense.

963
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
We don't have to write a cohesive character.

964
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,920
He's mad and that's it.

965
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,360
That's all you're gonna get.

966
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,400
Fuck you.

967
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,640
At the end of season one slash beginning of two,

968
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
he threatens them, leaves,

969
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,320
realizes he should probably kill them,

970
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,600
comes back in to do it,

971
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,200
then changes his mind again once the cliffhanger's over and season two starts.

972
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,040
What's the lesson here?

973
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,320
Also, why does he come back in?

974
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,280
He could have just said,

975
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,480
hey, snipers, just kill him.

976
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,720
The villain is practically all-powerful,

977
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,680
doesn't kill Sherlock for the sake of the fun of messing with him,

978
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,960
and Sherlock never, ever gets the upper hand or surprises him

979
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,880
because he's so ridiculously smart.

980
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,360
This makes the conflict have no real weight for the viewer

981
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,040
and thereby render it pointless.

982
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,960
Moriarty always holds all the cards and knows more than Sherlock does.

983
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,720
Boring!

984
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I could have got them anywhere.

985
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,840
In the books, when he's tracking down other criminals and, of course, Moriarty,

986
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,320
Sherlock has to try very hard not to get murdered,

987
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,640
and in the original novel, literally does

988
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,320
because Moriarty and himself end up shuffling off the Reichenbach Falls together.

989
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,280
In this version, Moriarty literally doesn't want Sherlock dead

990
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,680
and he doesn't really care about his crime empire

991
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,960
because he shoots himself in the head simply as a ploy to mess with him.

992
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,160
He's just fucking around with an impossibly genius-level intellect

993
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,600
to seemingly no end,

994
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,440
except literally his own.

995
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
Sometimes he's a pragmatic mastermind

996
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,120
who'll do anything to protect even the vaguest sliver of his identity,

997
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,720
like have this lady murdered

998
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,880
or detonate the bombs on the old woman when she tries to tell Sherlock he sounded nice.

999
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
If you don't stop prying...

1000
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
I will burn you.

1001
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I will burn...

1002
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,880
a horse out of you.

1003
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,280
Why not just burn him anyway?

1004
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,080
Why make this allowance for the one man who actually stands a chance of ever catching you?

1005
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,160
Oh, oh, because he's crazy.

1006
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,320
So we don't have to justify it. He's crazy.

1007
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,720
The original Moriarty shows up in two stories,

1008
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,000
is formidable and wants Sherlock dead for fucking with him,

1009
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,200
and the two die in mortal combat trying to kill each other,

1010
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,600
although Sherlock is eventually revealed to have survived

1011
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,720
after a full decade of readers being convinced he was dead.

1012
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,160
This Moriarty runs seemingly all crime everywhere,

1013
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,720
will go to great lengths to protect his identity,

1014
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,880
but is also so fascinated by Sherlock,

1015
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,360
he'll literally kill himself to see what he does

1016
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,960
while gaybaiting the fuck out of him

1017
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,120
so Tumblr will give it some shipping attention.

1018
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,520
Then, when Sherlock dies to stop his plans,

1019
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,680
ten minutes later it turns out Sherlock isn't dead

1020
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,400
because the writers can't even trust you to wait for the next season

1021
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,040
because they're rightfully worried you'd lose interest in this garbage

1022
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,800
if the story felt too conclusive.

1023
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,320
He kills himself because I guess they wanted him to do something surprising.

1024
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,320
The most essential thing about Moriarty for me

1025
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,440
is that you don't know what you're gonna get on the day,

1026
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,920
that he has to be completely surprising.

1027
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,880
So they had him do the stupidest fucking thing possible.

1028
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,480
The only way this could be stupider

1029
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,440
is if right before he shot himself in the head for no reason,

1030
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,280
he told Sherlock he was going to come back

1031
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,040
for every season finale afterwards

1032
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,840
as an increasingly stupid and bullshit fake-out

1033
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,760
or that Sherlock has a secret sister he magically forgot about

1034
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,360
and also a mega super double secret old best friend

1035
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,920
who he remembers as a dog for some reason

1036
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,440
and who the sister killed.

1037
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,280
That would be really stupid, wouldn't it?

1038
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,160
But Moriarty's shitty characterization doesn't end there.

1039
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,760
After the big twist in season two

1040
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,320
that there is no secret all-powerful hacking technology,

1041
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,720
No, no, no, no, no.

1042
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,600
This is too easy. This is too easy.

1043
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,120
There is no key.

1044
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,320
You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code

1045
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,080
are gonna crash the world around our ears.

1046
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,800
I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed in you.

1047
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,760
It turns out that it does exist because this happens.

1048
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,440
They were worried people would stop watching

1049
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,120
if there was no Moriarty to fight,

1050
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,680
and they just killed the other quite well-known villain,

1051
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,760
so they had to make sure they implied he was coming back

1052
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,240
because if everything doesn't tie into Moriarty,

1053
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,920
there's basically no story here.

1054
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,680
He doesn't actually come back either.

1055
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,840
This turns out to just be, like,

1056
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,600
I think this turns out to be a plot hole.

1057
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,120
Like, who did this in the end?

1058
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,960
Did someone who works for Moriarty do it?

1059
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,240
Did he set this up to happen long after his death?

1060
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,760
Uh, did Uris do it?

1061
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,400
After teasing everyone into thinking he's going to come back

1062
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,720
and having an entire special dedicated to figuring out

1063
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,840
that, yes, he's dead,

1064
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,160
but he must just have some other plans going,

1065
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,960
it just keeps turning out to not have anything to do with him,

1066
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,160
and the plot continues on as if Moriarty wasn't around.

1067
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
Then, in the worst episode of all time,

1068
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,760
it turns out before he died,

1069
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,760
Moriarty met Sherlock's secret sister

1070
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,600
and provided video recordings to use

1071
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,240
in some bullshit thing she pulls for him for no reason

1072
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,880
other than she's crazy.

1073
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,160
Woo!

1074
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,120
Nice one, Steve.

1075
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,600
You got out of having to characterize yet another villain.

1076
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,520
At least you didn't make this one gay.

1077
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Oh, and at the very end of the show, this happens.

1078
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,480
Surprise.

1079
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,560
You didn't think I'd just disappear, did you?

1080
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,000
Now, provided the show actually gets another season,

1081
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,120
baiting people with the return of Moriarty yet again

1082
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,320
after all this time establishing he's definitely dead

1083
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,920
is absolutely taking the piss,

1084
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,560
and I don't even want to know about a prospective season five

1085
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,840
or what that would look like

1086
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,280
because I have no idea how the show could possibly get any worse,

1087
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,720
so instead I'm gonna just move on.

1088
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,680
Another thing Sherlock has is a style problem.

1089
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,240
It's clear the production crew were given a vastly higher budget

1090
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,480
than the majority of British television normally gets,

1091
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,600
and you can see why,

1092
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,880
except for Doctor Who, QI, British Bake Off, Come Dine With Me,

1093
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,480
and The Legacy of Colonialism,

1094
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,120
Britain has virtually no remaining cultural exports,

1095
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,640
so it makes sense for the BBC to invest heavily in the TV adaptation

1096
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,640
of one of our most important cultural icons

1097
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,120
so people think we're still relevant as a nation.

1098
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,800
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like anyone really knew what to do with that money,

1099
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,960
so consequently the show is overproduced to the point where it only gets in the way.

1100
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,000
The show is trying at every moment to be the coolest,

1101
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,560
most important thing in the entire world,

1102
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,120
and it has the time and money to execute on this,

1103
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,600
which isn't necessarily a good thing.

1104
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,080
The most obvious way this features is the text that comes up

1105
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,160
whenever Sherlock's doing his magic mind powers

1106
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,000
or whenever someone gets a message on their phone

1107
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,240
and appears on screen in a cool visual way.

1108
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,120
This makes sense, and so do things like having images be wiped

1109
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,520
by people moving through them or doors closing and stuff.

1110
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,480
That's just nice editing, and it does help scenes flow together easier.

1111
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,080
This is a vast improvement on Jekyll,

1112
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,080
which appears to have been rushed and had no budget,

1113
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,640
so you get stuff like Hyde's super strength being shown off

1114
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,160
by having them just fast-forward footage of James Nesbitt walking normally,

1115
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,280
or this shot.

1116
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,400
You can see the bones of the style Moffat and the production team of Sherlock

1117
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
finally get the budget to actually make,

1118
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,520
but it just doesn't work.

1119
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,080
This is meant to be Hyde drinking a lot of alcohol very quickly

1120
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,200
because of his advanced metabolism and unexplained superpowers,

1121
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,760
but it just looks like a guy drinking and fast-forward,

1122
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,600
and the sound effects just make it silly.

1123
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,160
A lot of the special effects in scenes that are meant to be scarier

1124
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,160
just dutch angles and shaky cam with undercrank and weird filters.

1125
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,400
Sherlock's enhanced budget and scope of production

1126
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,920
allows it to pull off versions of this without looking as terrible.

1127
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,520
When Sherlock's using his mind powers,

1128
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,680
because let's be honest, that's basically what they are,

1129
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,720
the soundtrack swells and all kinds of cool sound effects are used

1130
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,800
to get across his sheer attentiveness.

1131
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,160
Here, for example, because she was scraping the ground with her nails,

1132
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,640
as the text appears, you hear a nail-scraping sound.

1133
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,160
Giving the text a sound effect as it writes itself in

1134
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,560
helps draw your attention to it, make it pop.

1135
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,680
They use pen drawing and nose-sniffling noises when he talks about those,

1136
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,240
and you can even see they animate the images as it happens.

1137
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,840
They do this because they think you're an idiot

1138
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,920
and don't understand what writing with a pen means,

1139
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,560
so you need both visual and audio cues.

1140
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,800
This use of images and sound effects is very effective.

1141
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,960
It helps trick the viewer into thinking they're doing more

1142
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,120
than watching Benedict Cumberbatch sit in a chair

1143
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,040
and tell you about things he's noticed.

1144
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,080
In a way, I wouldn't really recommend analyzing this show too much.

1145
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,800
I must mention that paying attention to sound and visuals

1146
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,680
causes the show's trick to start to wear thin very quickly.

1147
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,960
The trousers. They're pretty full.

1148
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,560
At its best, you get intense scenes where the level of thinking

1149
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,240
being done by Sherlock is highlighted

1150
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,600
and you're put into his mind with these extreme close-ups and pauses,

1151
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,720
seeing the world how this mega-genius sees it for brief spurts,

1152
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,080
and it's all very stylish.

1153
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,720
At its worst, this style is a stupid nonsense mess

1154
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,120
that ends up being needless or just straight-up silly.

1155
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
I swear to God, I didn't edit that in!

1156
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,360
This tonally dissonant nightmare doesn't put us in Sherlock's mind

1157
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,200
and doesn't even show us his trail of thought.

1158
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,040
It's just text and images flying past the screen with weird sound effects.

1159
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,360
This is the sort of thing I would do for a quick joke,

1160
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,440
not the dramatic investigation scene.

1161
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,640
Ooh!

1162
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,000
You ain't got the...

1163
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,920
The show is so dedicated to this amped-up, over-the-top style

1164
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,960
that it applies it to places that are incredibly poorly served by it.

1165
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,560
My favorite examples are in this one.

1166
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,960
My favorite examples are in the wedding episode.

1167
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,400
Firstly, you have this bizarre montage of Sherlock and Watson getting drunk,

1168
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,920
set to a fucking atrocious dubstep remix of the show's theme

1169
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,520
with a blurry vignette over it

1170
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,600
because that's what alcohol does!

1171
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,000
Intersected with ultra-fast graphs of their night out,

1172
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,760
and you're like, whoa, wait, I didn't even see that!

1173
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,400
What? What?

1174
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,320
This is the most overproduced pub crawl in the history of television,

1175
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,440
but the bestest example ever is earlier in the episode

1176
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,160
when you have the wedding photographer taking the gang's pictures.

1177
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,840
Okay, three, two, one, cheese!

1178
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,520
The music swells, you get this cool time-frozen effect and all that.

1179
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,360
This shot was quite difficult to pull off.

1180
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,880
I know someone who worked on this episode.

1181
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,440
They had to build a giant rig with dozens of DSLRs

1182
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,400
all at precise positions and angles and focal distances.

1183
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,560
This is a cool technique two of my favorite directors,

1184
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,040
the Wachowskis, pioneered for the Matrix.

1185
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,920
In theory, this is a nice set of shots, right?

1186
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,480
But there's a difference between theory and practice.

1187
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,560
What is happening in these shots?

1188
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,080
How is the story being furthered?

1189
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,840
What action is being exacerbated by executing the scene with this technique?

1190
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,760
It's a few, brief, elaborate, expensive shots

1191
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,800
of people getting their picture taken at a wedding.

1192
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,080
The Wachowskis only used this technique in the most intense moments

1193
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,760
of some of the most dramatic and well-edited action scenes in film history,

1194
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,480
where a single second decompressed during a life-or-death moment has maximum payoff.

1195
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,560
I don't know which Berk saw this scene and thought,

1196
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,760
Oh, let's do that!

1197
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,400
But for the scene where everyone's standing still.

1198
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,480
But whoever they were, they should have been fired.

1199
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,200
But I guess, since the writers accidentally wrote an episode

1200
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,080
mostly consisting of Sherlock farting about at a wedding,

1201
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,800
I guess they decided they had to blow the budget on something.

1202
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,960
By golly, I wonder who produced this sho—

1203
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,240
Oh.

1204
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,120
Is this a purposeful reference to the Matrix?

1205
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,040
Like, it wouldn't be the first time they did that.

1206
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,960
They did that thing at the beginning with the two pills.

1207
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,120
What's the deal with these references?

1208
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,680
All right, if you take this pill, you wake up in your bed,

1209
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,520
and the Sherlock TV series was never made.

1210
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,360
It was all a bad dream.

1211
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,040
If you take this pill, you have to watch all of it.

1212
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,540
Again.

1213
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,800
Oh, cool.

1214
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,680
Uh, what do you want in return?

1215
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,920
Do I need to, like, suck your dick or something?

1216
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,720
What? No, no.

1217
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,200
I'm gonna shoot you if you don't take either pill.

1218
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,480
But you've gotta take one.

1219
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,360
That's all.

1220
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:22,860
Really?

1221
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,120
Wow, you just talked yourself out of a sweet deal, mister.

1222
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,620
Oh.

1223
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,460
Ah, sign me the fuck up, sailor.

1224
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:30,960
Ah.

1225
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,700
I forgot where I was going with this bit.

1226
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,580
I'm sorry.

1227
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,940
This kind of attitude to production can be bad for creativity.

1228
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,180
Throwing all the money ever at every scene means you get shots like this getting in the way of the story,

1229
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,380
and supposedly tense moments of Sherlock trying to figure something out

1230
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,180
are ruined by flinging random images and sound effects at the audience in the name of production value.

1231
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,540
This is the one lesson I'd have expected Moffat to have learned by now.

1232
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,780
You see, one thing Doctor Who was quite famous for

1233
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:03,180
was shooting for expensive ideas and concepts so often with such tight schedules

1234
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,260
that it becomes necessary for there to be episodes

1235
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,420
where the main characters don't make too much of an appearance

1236
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,900
and there aren't too many effects or expensive props.

1237
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,540
Within these constraints, Moffat himself wrote Blink,

1238
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,100
one of the most universally loved episodes of the show,

1239
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,180
where the Doctor and Martha barely show up and the monsters literally don't even move,

1240
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,340
creating some incredibly tense moments out of almost no budget whatsoever,

1241
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,260
such as this sphincter-tightening scene of a light starting to flicker

1242
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,780
and perhaps the most incredibly engaging piece of drama in the entire show,

1243
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,980
where a character's arguing with a pre-recorded message of the Doctor

1244
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,740
that knows what they're about to say.

1245
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,780
How can you have a copy of the finished transcript? It's still being written.

1246
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,180
I told you, I'm a time traveler. I've got it in the future.

1247
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,700
Blink won a ton of awards,

1248
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,140
and I feel proves with its efficient execution on time and budget constraints

1249
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,780
that sometimes limitations can be good for creativity.

1250
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,500
I didn't really believe that old aphorism until I saw Sherlock

1251
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,580
and realized that if you give people too much money,

1252
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,540
they do shit like this instead of tell an engaging story.

1253
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,180
This production style leads to characters being underused

1254
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,700
because they have so little to do

1255
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,900
because the focus is on overproducing the scenes where Sherlock does stuff

1256
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,420
and other random bullshit instead of making them a decent addition to the story.

1257
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,460
This problem even extends to the second principal character,

1258
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,580
John Watson.

1259
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,540
Watson sucks and has no purpose in this version of the story.

1260
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,220
Mary Watson. No, seriously.

1261
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,940
After shooting the baddie at the end of episode one,

1262
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,260
Watson has nothing to do and spends most of his time

1263
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,220
getting treated like shit by his friend for no reason

1264
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,940
and running around next to him while he solves everything.

1265
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,940
Watson is the point-of-view character,

1266
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,740
the literal narrator for most of the home stories,

1267
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,180
and he barely even gets to see plenty of the events of the plot.

1268
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,380
What else does he d—

1269
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,660
Oh, one time he gets kidnapped and Sherlock has to save him.

1270
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,900
Oh, another time he, uh, uh, he gets mysteriously kidnapped and Sherlock has to—

1271
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,260
Uh, one time, um, he starts a fire?

1272
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,300
Oh, and technically, he's there sometimes while Sherlock figures stuff out.

1273
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,620
He's also here for, uh, this fight, I guess.

1274
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,140
Oh, and also, there's the time when, uh, he gets kidnapped and Sherlock has to save—

1275
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,500
One time, he gets held at gunpoint and Sherlock has—

1276
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,660
One time, gets held at gunpoint—

1277
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,020
Ah, I just made my ears ring, slapping my face.

1278
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,780
Jesus Christ.

1279
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,260
Fuck you, Steve.

1280
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,380
And oh my God, did you see Watson in the background for this exciting scene?

1281
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:25,020
Literally, the most important thing Watson does in all of season two is watch Sherlock die.

1282
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:31,580
The wedding episode has a bit where Sherlock tells us Watson is a good doctor and a really helpful ally and provides anecdotes of times

1283
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,420
he did stuff useful to a case.

1284
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:38,460
Wouldn't it have been great if Watson's skills had come in handy in the episodes of the show that were actually made?

1285
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,260
And not the ones that are his backstory for this wedding?

1286
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:45,740
The guy's a doctor and a war survivor and the POV character for most of the books,

1287
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,020
and he's barely even a presence at his own fucking wedding,

1288
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,780
dedicated to Sherlock's hour-long speech supposedly about him,

1289
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,940
but really about how smart Sherlock is for figuring out a crime during a speech.

1290
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,140
Fuck off.

1291
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,100
Mary Watson.

1292
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,540
John's wife is a minor character in some of the books and not super important,

1293
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,420
but his relationship with his wife does come up in interesting ways,

1294
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:10,220
usually in order to make points about the limited roles of women in British society in the time the story was set.

1295
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,100
In the show, she just sort of appears between seasons two and three. The episode after that is their wedding,

1296
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:15,980
although don't worry,

1297
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:20,940
we all know who that episode is really about, and then the next episode after that she turns out to be a secret ninja assassin.

1298
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,460
Then in the next episode, not counting the special because the bulk of it takes place in Sherlock's imagination and she's not really in it,

1299
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,260
she dies. Mary lived a hugely interesting life and it would have made for a pretty cool addition to the story.

1300
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Unfortunately, most of it happens in the same place most of the interesting stuff in the show happens.

1301
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:36,940
Off-screen.

1302
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,180
Then for some reason, John sees her as a ghost for a bit,

1303
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,380
and then she gives the dumbest speech of all time about how mega special Holmes and Watson are, even though Watson doesn't

1304
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,060
do anything, and even she had more input on the events of the four episodes

1305
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,940
she had the privilege of being alive for. You've got to hand it to Moffat.

1306
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,180
He finally created a strong, smart,

1307
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,980
interesting female character, and then just when she was getting a chance to really interact with the story,

1308
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:04,460
he fucking kills her to create tension for the real main characters. Sherlock and whoever this guy is, what does he do?

1309
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,780
I think he got kidnapped a few times. Nice going, Steve.

1310
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,460
You fleshed out an actually clever addition to the main story just to kill her.

1311
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:16,940
Although I can see why that would be necessary. There's only so many important women in the original stories to ruin, aren't there?

1312
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,400
Speaking of which.

1313
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,420
Okay, this is gonna be a kind of tough one to get into.

1314
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,620
You see,

1315
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,620
in the pantheon of Sherlock Holmes,

1316
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:39,340
there are some characters who stick out so well because they're so unique or different or well-written

1317
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,100
or special for the time period in which the stories were first made

1318
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,940
that future adaptations can't help but lavish them with even more attention.

1319
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:55,740
You know, you would expect Moriarty to be made into this giant supervillain because,

1320
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,340
you know, even though he was only in two stories, one of them was the one that killed Sherlock Holmes for 10 years.

1321
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
That's a really good reason to stand out.

1322
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:11,180
Irene Adler makes it into almost every single adaptation there is of Sherlock Holmes,

1323
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,060
and she was in one story.

1324
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,940
The third one ever.

1325
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,940
A scandal in Bohemia.

1326
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:24,940
Sherlock is approached by the king of Bohemia who is about to get married to a princess and consolidate a shit-ton of land and power,

1327
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:30,540
but five years ago he had a love affair with a controversial opera singer called Irene Adler and sent her love letters and a

1328
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:37,180
compromising photo. The original dick pic. And since the background of the picture clearly shows his My Little Pony collection,

1329
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,980
he's worried Adler will email it to his in-laws and the wedding will be called off and he'll lose out on a sweet deal.

1330
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,000
Her majesty has certainly committed an indiscretion.

1331
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:52,780
The king offers Sherlock basically infinite money if he can get that stuff back because none of his people have any idea where it's hidden.

1332
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:58,140
So you have a story in which Sherlock is covering up for a king's actions by stealing from an innocent woman

1333
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:02,380
who basically did nothing wrong. Sherlock and the king aren't the good guys here.

1334
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,660
Sherlock is dismissive about Adler. Sure, he can outsmart a woman.

1335
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:10,380
He knows what they're like. In disguise, Sherlock tricks Adler into revealing its location.

1336
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,300
But when he comes back later to get it, he discovers instead a letter telling him,

1337
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:21,020
Nah, nah, nice try, idiot, and finds she's married out of love for someone and left the country and just wants to move on with her life.

1338
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,540
Adler outsmarts Sherlock and gets away with it,

1339
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:29,420
which is more than can ever be said for almost anyone else in the entire series. And moreover,

1340
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,300
she disproves his reductive view of women while she does it.

1341
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,540
Sherlock loses and has to learn a lesson from it and the viewer is shown that even the great

1342
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,900
detective is not immune to the biases of the culture he lives in. It's not a feminist story by modern standards,

1343
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,160
but for a story published by a man in the 1890s,

1344
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,780
it makes careful strides in showing that not only are women capable of being as smart as men,

1345
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,340
but if we don't get over the preconception that they can't be, they will win every time.

1346
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:58,960
Sherlock gains a grudging respect for her, not in a romantic way, but because he appreciates that he's been outsmarted.

1347
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,260
What a queen she would have made.

1348
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,720
Is it not a pity she was not on my level?

1349
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,660
From what I have seen of the lady, yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your majesty.

1350
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,220
In 2012's Scandal in Belgravia,

1351
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,340
Sherlock beats Irene, who, by the way, is sexually attracted to him now,

1352
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,420
and also then later he saves her life because she gets captured when she goes on the run.

1353
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,180
Oh, and also she's a fucking bisexual kung fu dominatrix now.

1354
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,860
That's...

1355
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,860
That's one way of adapting the story. This episode's already been criticized to hell and back.

1356
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,580
I'm going to defend a couple of small things about it,

1357
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:43,500
like how Adler defeats Sherlock's over-the-top special effects text-o-vision by simply not wearing anything,

1358
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:49,100
and I like that the show leaves it somewhat ambiguous whether this is because it leaves Sherlock with nothing to easily detect,

1359
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,820
or if it's because he just reacted that badly to seeing a naked woman. Those were the pros.

1360
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:59,420
Did you miss them? You might have blinked. The cons include everything else. Firstly, she doesn't beat Sherlock.

1361
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:06,060
She loses, and then losing puts her in a bad situation, which, don't worry, Sherlock saves her from. How heroic.

1362
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,460
But secondly, Sherlock's heroic now. This is a big deal.

1363
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:16,780
Scandal was impactful because Sherlock worked for the bad guy, a rich and powerful king trying to tie up loose ends

1364
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:21,660
so his convenient marriage to someone he clearly didn't really care about could go off as smoothly as possible.

1365
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:27,500
Now Adler is directly blackmailing people and also is stealing really important intelligence from the British government.

1366
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,860
Sherlock is arguably doing the right thing by getting involved here.

1367
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:37,260
The moral ambiguity that the original story's had is being erased in the name of making him always the good guy.

1368
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,980
Then it turns out she's working directly with Moriarty, the real bad guy, because, of course,

1369
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,540
everything has to tie into Moriarty now, and basically she's acting on his orders and advice.

1370
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,940
I can't take all the credit.

1371
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,420
Had a bit of help.

1372
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,900
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

1373
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:59,420
Yes, he's been in touch. And of course, she loses because of those pesky emotions.

1374
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:03,980
She couldn't help but have feelings for Shirley because he's so dreamy and nice

1375
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,100
and not at all a constant piece of shit in the actual show.

1376
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,180
In an adaptation of a story where the character wins using her own wits,

1377
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:16,060
she's told what to do by others and then is beaten and then has to be saved.

1378
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,980
If the creators of the show were really this disinterested in telling a story using the original traits of Irene Adler,

1379
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:26,380
why even put her in here? Why not come up with a new female character to ruin?

1380
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,220
Oh, no, wait, they do that in season four, don't they?

1381
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,100
Despite, as you can tell, not really liking the show that much,

1382
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:36,060
I was looking forward to this story being adapted because I was hoping for this Sherlock to finally learn

1383
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,860
he wasn't always right about people and be a little bit humbled.

1384
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:43,820
But Moffat was too busy being clever, tying everything into the now all-powerful Moriarty and

1385
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,860
hashtag modernizing the story by making a woman marrying for love in the 1890s into a dominatrix that he forgot to put in the

1386
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,900
fun core of the story, and we're left with a Sherlock who finishes exactly as he began.

1387
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,740
Bored, smart, and the bestest guy ever.

1388
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:03,340
Well, I guess he kind of has a semi-girlfriend now.

1389
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,180
That's kind of like character development.

1390
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:12,480
Scandal in Belgravia doesn't just fuck up the most important non-protagonist character in the entire canon behind maybe Moriarty.

1391
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,700
It also contains the scene.

1392
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,260
To me, it is always the scene. You will seldom hear me mention it under any other name.

1393
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:29,420
In my eyes, it eclipses and predominates the whole of the series. It's the crown in the crown jewels?

1394
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:37,580
Of the whole sordid affair. The scene combines all the worst aspects of this fucking show and compresses it down into a solid

1395
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,420
diamond of shit.

1396
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:45,660
The mystery Sherlock is called in to solve before the Adler thing starts is about a guy who's found dead with seemingly no apparent cause.

1397
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:50,300
We're shown nothing, no clues that could possibly leave a keen-eyed viewer with the chance to figure it out.

1398
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,420
He solves it, but doesn't explain what happened or how he figured it out or why, and just stops bothering with it.

1399
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:00,220
Then, in an extravagant and fucking ridiculous scene, him and Adler sci-fi

1400
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,340
imaginate their way through a scene neither of them have actually been to, and Irene discovers that...

1401
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,540
a fucking boomerang did it.

1402
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,540
A boomerang.

1403
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,540
Boomerang.

1404
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,540
Boomerang.

1405
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,540
Boomerang.

1406
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,540
Boomerang.

1407
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,540
Boomerang.

1408
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,540
Boomerang.

1409
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,540
Boomerang.

1410
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1411
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,940
We've talked before about times where the show has pulled something out of its ass,

1412
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:37,280
but this fucking scene puts them all to rest. Based on nothing, based on no clues we've been given whatsoever,

1413
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:44,700
Sherlock leads Irene to the conclusion that a boomerang did it, and the show presents this as Sherlock being a massive super mega genius.

1414
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:50,620
We get shots of Adler making googly eyes at him because she's so attracted to him now that she knows he successfully solved the stupidest

1415
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,780
written scene in television history.

1416
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:58,220
The epic soundtrack swells, and everyone wishes they were being killed by a fucking boomerang.

1417
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:04,380
The key to mystery stories, the white, hot, burning core of the genre that makes it what it is,

1418
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:09,100
is being given information just enough that you could maybe figure out what was happening,

1419
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:13,660
and then having a character show you something about the information you managed to miss, or

1420
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,220
put the pieces together in a way you wouldn't expect.

1421
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:23,260
But to make sure you can't possibly solve it before Sherlock does, because he's supposed to be the most amazing special boy in the world,

1422
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,840
they can't risk giving you too much information.

1423
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,740
So they craft a story in which you're shown basically nothing, and then told,

1424
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:36,380
Bing! It's a legendary serial killer I just made up. Bing! Someone else told me the answer off screen. Bing!

1425
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,980
It was a fucking boomerang! The audience will never really accept

1426
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,940
Sherlock as smart, because they're never given the pieces for themselves, and then presented with a solution

1427
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:50,380
they wouldn't have thought of. Instead, they're told next to nothing, and then Sherlock walks in with the information

1428
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,760
you didn't have, or does something unbelievably unrealistic.

1429
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,700
You got that from one look?

1430
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,420
Definitely the new sexy.

1431
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:06,300
The show is edited as if you're supposed to, like Adler, be completely in awe of this genius, but that's never gonna happen.

1432
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:11,980
Contrast is required. This is precisely why puzzles are fascinating in the first place. There's a tangible,

1433
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,560
emotional reaction to figuring out how to solve something, and putting something together.

1434
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:22,140
Similarly, for a mystery story to work, you have to be shown the problem and the clues before it's solved,

1435
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:26,300
so you have a chance to do it yourself, and then marvel at seeing someone else find the solution.

1436
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:31,900
You're entertained by seeing someone else solve a puzzle you can't, because you recognize they've seen something you haven't.

1437
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,660
Sherlock gives you a meaningless glimpse of a trivial piece of the puzzle,

1438
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,340
then produces the finished puzzle, and tells you it was very hard, I promise.

1439
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:45,420
In this show, the viewer's never given a chance to observe, so there's nothing for Sherlock to reveal he observed.

1440
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,980
So you're left with an incredibly expensive sequence of elaborate camera tricks shot on an Arri Alexa,

1441
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:55,900
featuring a man telling you he's very smart, because he observed events you never got the chance to observe better than you.

1442
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,140
Look at all these hard-working people,

1443
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:01,820
dragging their camera rigs all the way out here so they can film a smooth transition,

1444
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:07,420
laying all their dolly tracks, and looking a couch all the way out there, and carefully planning and timing dozens of shots,

1445
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:13,340
doing excellent professional work, and it's all in service to a mystery story where you're not told anything,

1446
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:16,300
so you're not engaged with it at all, and then at the end,

1447
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:21,340
you're told a fucking bullshit explanation that you could not have seen coming, and he was really smart.

1448
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,620
You just have to trust me. Why is the camera spinning so much?

1449
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,820
Is it to make this revelation feel more dramatic, or is it to simulate the spinning of a boomerang?

1450
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,060
Do boomerangs even spin?

1451
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,340
Is that why they did this?

1452
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:39,980
Fittingly, this scene keeps coming back in my nightmares to taunt me with how stupid it is.

1453
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,340
This scene is so bad,

1454
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:50,380
it almost makes you forget that the final scene of this episode is Sherlock single-handedly fighting Al-Qaeda with a machete.

1455
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,820
I half expected the boomerang to come back and take a couple of guys out for him.

1456
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,700
Credit where credit is due,

1457
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:01,740
there's still a lot to like about the Sherlock Show, at least to begin with. For all its massive flaws,

1458
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,860
it's still very good at making you think it's going to get better,

1459
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:09,260
and there are plenty of decent moments and fun bits that make you keep watching just to see,

1460
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:15,020
just to see if it can start having more of them and maybe go somewhere with all the plots it has going. Season 4

1461
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:21,020
destroyed that illusion. Let me explain in a roundabout way first. When I was doing research for this video,

1462
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:27,020
I stumbled upon a bunch of theories about Season 4. The usual Sherlock stuff explaining how secretly gay the main characters are,

1463
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,220
but the one that really caught my eye was the Lost Special Theory.

1464
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:36,460
You see, for some Sherlock fans, the fact the show is bad is just a minor hitch in the grand scheme of the amazing

1465
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,940
metanarrative of Moffat's mythic reimagining of Sherlock as a magical pretty boy.

1466
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:48,700
Thus, the horrific badness and plot holes of Season 4 are just more data to incorporate into a running theory about what's really going on.

1467
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:54,700
The conclusion quite a lot of people reached was that the last episodes of Sherlock couldn't possibly be as bad as they were.

1468
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:02,540
Instead, it's a fake-out, a build-up to a secret, unannounced fourth episode of Season 4 in which everything is really explained.

1469
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:09,180
The garbage from the previous eight, sorry, three episodes is revealed to be a hallucination or a play or a dream sequence,

1470
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,460
and the show finally turns out to have always been good.

1471
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:18,860
The main focal point of the theory was a show supposedly starting just after the end of Sherlock called Appletree Yard.

1472
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:25,120
The theory is that Appletree Yard is a codename, and in reality, it's when the fourth Sherlock airs and all is revealed.

1473
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:30,460
The proof? The show's website's German language version or something is a 404 page.

1474
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,540
404.

1475
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,260
Get it? Season 4? Episode 4?

1476
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,420
Oh my god, even the inventor of HTTP's error messages is in on it.

1477
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:43,500
And if that wasn't enough to prove it, the lead actress's name is Emily Watson.

1478
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,900
Watson.

1479
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,500
Watson. And if that's not enough to convince you, and I certainly hope it isn't,

1480
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:53,740
there's plenty more evidence coming your way. At one point in the show, Sherlock says,

1481
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,460
We found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat.

1482
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,860
All your possessions were searched.

1483
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:06,280
Speaking of something comforting about the number three, people always give up after three.

1484
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,180
See?

1485
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,180
Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.

1486
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,940
The Appletree.

1487
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:15,820
Clowns, magpies, and fish, none of which go together whatsoever aesthetically.

1488
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,540
But all of which has intricate symbolic meaning.

1489
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,540
Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.

1490
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:26,300
And in this promotional image for the series, Mark Gatiss is holding up four fingers. See?

1491
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,300
Secret good fourth Sherlock episode.

1492
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,940
Oh, wait, that might have just been because it's the fourth season.

1493
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,980
But you can see how the crushing weight of all this evidence caused me to hold off on working on this video for a while.

1494
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,380
Just in case it turned out that there really was going to be another one.

1495
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:45,820
Just in case Appletree Yard was fake, and Moffat was really a secret genius,

1496
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:50,300
only pretending to be a bad showrunner this entire time, and then Appletree Yard aired.

1497
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:56,220
And guess what? You'll never believe it, but it turns out it was an adaptation of Appletree Yard,

1498
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:01,660
starring Emily Watson, which is just her name, because some people are called Watson.

1499
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,700
The hashtag on Twitter for Appletree Yard when it aired was,

1500
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:10,300
5% people interested in this new show or an adaptation of a book they quite liked, and 95%

1501
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:17,180
pissed Sherlock fans, waiting to see when Sherlock would show up and retroactively justified the bad show he was in.

1502
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:21,580
It didn't happen, and the fan theory people were mostly apologetic about getting everyone's hopes up, or

1503
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:26,940
annoyed that it turned out their show had always been bad, and had just tricked them into thinking it would be with flashy,

1504
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,500
overproduced, bullet-time wedding photos.

1505
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,500
I wouldn't write this if I wouldn't be utterly convinced that this is going to happen.

1506
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:39,260
Johnlock is endgame. The series isn't finished yet, and I'm going to tell you why.

1507
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:45,500
Because it doesn't make sense. I want to remind you that these people have been producing Sherlock for seven years now.

1508
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:51,420
Seven years. They put hard work into it, told us again and again that every little detail matters.

1509
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:58,460
Do you truly believe anyone on the show, including the producers, the cast, etc., would all suddenly lose their minds overnight?

1510
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,700
Overnight? I mean, it's possible.

1511
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:06,300
I can't even tell you which night it was. The one right before Moffat decided to adapt Sherlock Holmes.

1512
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,260
I've never actually thought Apple Tree Yard was a completely fake show,

1513
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:15,120
so literally all this does is defer my questions. Why was the final problem badly written on purpose?

1514
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:24,060
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to tell you this, but it wasn't bad on purpose.

1515
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,940
They were trying to make a good show and failed, and even if it's bad on purpose,

1516
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,780
that still just means the show's bad. A secret fourth episode

1517
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:39,900
still wouldn't be a get-out-of-jail-free card for wasting your goddamn time, and more importantly, mine.

1518
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:44,380
But since the secret lost episode never came to fruition because it doesn't exist,

1519
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,700
I can finally conclude that I have, in fact, seen all of season four of Sherlock and can therefore weigh in on it.

1520
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,420
It's really bad.

1521
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:59,180
So bad that people who wanted to like the show had to invent a secret good episode that would, if it existed,

1522
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,060
somehow fix it. It's orders of magnitude worse than the rest of the show,

1523
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,180
and I'm pretty sure I've established that's already pretty bad. But what's bad about it goes fairly deep.

1524
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:15,660
It's not just that it's worse written, the characters are facsimiles of themselves, and the driving thrust of the story is utterly fallen apart.

1525
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:20,620
It's that ultimately it trips on the curtain and tears away all the flaws of the entire show from front to back,

1526
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,020
revealing it to have always been the worst, like a car that looks like a shambles,

1527
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,520
but at least convincingly seems to be headed in the right direction,

1528
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:32,460
until it collides with a brick wall and turns out to have been a doomed journey from the very start.

1529
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,820
So after the special in which Sherlock imaginary solves a crime

1530
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,340
he knows very little about and he figures out that Moriarty's definitely dead,

1531
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:45,820
so the game-changing twist of two years ago was once again fake fucking bullshit nonsense designed to trick you into thinking the show was going

1532
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:51,900
to get interesting. The implication was that Moriarty had some kind of plan designed to be executed after his death in order to, what,

1533
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,500
taunt Sherlock?

1534
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,660
Gain power he doesn't need because he's dead?

1535
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,260
Destroy the world or just mess with people for the fun of it?

1536
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,780
Who knows?

1537
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:04,620
I don't, because Moriarty doesn't figure at all into the actual plot of season four.

1538
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:10,460
The special also ends by implying something interesting is going to happen, with Sherlock striding off saying that he knows what Moriarty's people are

1539
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,580
going to do next.

1540
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,580
I know exactly what he's going to do next.

1541
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:19,820
The episode begins with Sherlock revealing he has no idea and he's just going to wait and see what happens next and react to it.

1542
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,180
We brought you back to deal with this. What are you going to do? Wait.

1543
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,180
So it's a setup for nothing.

1544
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:29,580
This is something a series has always done by ending implying something interesting is about to happen next and then

1545
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:34,220
it doesn't, but this series is especially fucking egregious about this.

1546
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,260
Instead Sherlock happens to notice a Thatcher statue broken and becomes fixated upon it

1547
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:44,940
and somehow becomes certain the remains of Moriarty's network want a pearl that might be hidden in the last Thatcher statue.

1548
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,580
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?

1549
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,020
I can't stand it. Never can.

1550
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,780
I have the strangest feeling.

1551
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,220
It is me.

1552
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:57,180
But then it turns out no, it's a completely unrelated series of events revolving around Watson's wife again.

1553
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:03,020
By the way, this is the exact bullshit twist they pulled in the previous episode where it turns out it's about Mary.

1554
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,540
It's hard to explain just how much whiplash there is in this season.

1555
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:11,260
The case in point with this one is that you spend the whole time waiting on a reveal that Sherlock really was onto something

1556
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,900
and then actually he's onto something completely different we also had no way of seeing coming.

1557
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:20,780
So then Mary goes undercover to try and hide so she can't be found by the other cool assassin guy

1558
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,020
and basically chooses random numbers

1559
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:27,900
so she's untraceable with this long montage showing just how hiding-y she's being and wow,

1560
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,820
she's incredibly super off the grid. We get it. And then bam, Sherlock's there.

1561
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,260
How did you find me?

1562
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,620
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

1563
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:43,420
Really though, how? Every movement I made was entirely random. Every new personality just on the roll of a dice.

1564
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,580
Once again, here's one of the key sorts of question begged by Sherlock Holmes stories.

1565
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,580
How did he solve the puzzle and figure it out?

1566
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:52,300
What sort of genius application of reason will make you go

1567
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:59,980
ah and feel like an idiot and marvel before the simplicity of it? The show recognizes that these questions are the point of Sherlock.

1568
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,340
Mary, no human action is ever truly random and I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine the seemingly

1569
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,840
infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.

1570
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,740
But they're really difficult so instead I just stuck a trace on the inside of the memory stick.

1571
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:19,740
But instead of giving a useful answer we get this bullshit fake explanation that turns out to be fake

1572
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:24,460
and actually he just put a tracking device in the USB pen that she took from him.

1573
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:30,220
This is played for a joke, but it's not a comedy fun time jokey joke to laugh at for comedy hijinks.

1574
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,980
It's a joke at the expense of the audience for even wanting to know how Sherlock did something.

1575
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:41,100
Sherlock finds Mary and fuck you if you hoped for or expected something clever.

1576
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:46,860
Then the assassin she's hiding from turns up because of course he was tracking Sherlock who knew he would track Mary.

1577
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:51,660
So we have this mega genius who knew to plant a tracking device before Mary could drug him and take the device

1578
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,740
but somehow isn't smart enough to A.

1579
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:58,540
Detect Mary was going to drug him and maybe stop her or talk her into working with him.

1580
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:03,740
B. React at all in a productive manner the way he did when he had a 10 minute sequence dedicated to

1581
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,900
how he reacted in the five seconds of consciousness he had as he passed out from being shot

1582
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:14,460
by Mary who at this point he maybe should be capable of anticipating attacks from or C.

1583
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:19,820
Notice he was being tracked himself or even think to consider he might be tracked by the assassin

1584
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:25,900
He'd met before and who knew who he was. So if everyone successfully tracks everyone to the same place and they fight

1585
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:31,500
Anyway, what was the point in writing it? So that this happens like this adds nothing to the actual story

1586
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:37,500
It's all a setup for this big fucking joke about how cool Sherlock is which we've been told enough by now

1587
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:41,180
This is yet more time that could have been spent telling a story

1588
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,300
It's a farce

1589
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,460
But it's rendered tragic by just how good Sherlock Holmes stories and adaptations can be

1590
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:54,140
Sherlock Holmes and the Pearl of Death adapted the same story fairly excellently by having clearly delineable themes about the power of money and greed

1591
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:59,660
And fear and having the MacGuffin actually just be a nice pearl lots of people wanted

1592
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:05,020
The pearl has been unobtainable across history because no group endeavor to find it has ever gone without

1593
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:11,260
Internal tensions all vying to take it for themselves. They always end up all killing each other and dying and leaving it lost again

1594
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,300
It stands for a deeper problem with the human soul

1595
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:21,020
All Sherlock's moves are understandable or explained in retrospect when the time comes with a nice reveal or

1596
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:26,780
Justified by reasoning that you could have noticed at the time and then maybe Sherlock reveals it and you go

1597
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:33,600
Ah, of course, it's a delightful romp where the story makes goddamn sense and real themes are explored

1598
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:39,520
No more than a symbol of the greed and cruelty and lust for power that have set men at each other's throats down through the centuries

1599
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,920
The struggle will go on Watson for a pearl

1600
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,720
Kingdom

1601
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,360
Perhaps even world dominion

1602
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,440
To the greed and cruelty of burned out of every last one of us

1603
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,520
When that time comes

1604
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,680
Perhaps even the pearl

1605
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,480
Will be washed clean again

1606
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,760
It's

1607
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:12,480
A good adaptation because it understands what was good about the original story and plays off it

1608
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,740
It doesn't do it for the first like

1609
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:23,840
Maybe 30 minutes and then it actually becomes as fucking stupid spy thing that once again is all about Mary in this story

1610
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,280
The killer is trying to kill Mary because he misunderstood a conversation

1611
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,320
Some torturers were having and assumed they were talking about Mary and therefore sought revenge for years and years and years

1612
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,720
The entire plot of this episode revolves around mishearing someone it's

1613
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,840
Literally the plot of the second half of Shrek

1614
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:47,240
but with some superficial aspects of the basic plot of the six Napoleons draped across it for the simple reason of

1615
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,200
Resembling a real Sherlock Holmes story. What are the themes? What's the story about?

1616
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:59,660
How does Sherlock happen to stumble upon the one crime being committed right that moment that happens to directly concern Mary Watson?

1617
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:07,140
Presumably because of magic Sherlock's so smart that he saw something and figured it out without even knowing he'd done it

1618
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:10,780
Because at this point that's how fucking bullshit the show is and yes

1619
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:16,980
Sometimes that is the justification for things he notices. You could attenuate to every strand of quivering data

1620
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:23,880
The future would be entirely calculable. I figured it out because I'm attuned to every data point

1621
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,500
Well, that's really fucking convenient, isn't it?

1622
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,900
It saves you having to write a story that people have to follow

1623
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:35,660
Oh, no, it doesn't because those are the people who watch it. This has to be entertaining for us to watch Steve

1624
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:41,600
Did you did you forget that the closest this episode has to a theme is this was a mistake?

1625
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:45,420
This never should have gotten this far. Thank God. It's the last season

1626
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:49,340
The show is so self-aware that killing off Mary Watson is a bad idea

1627
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,020
That she's actually still in the other two episodes

1628
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:57,740
Like she's a ghost for some of the second one and she appears on DVDs and then in the third one

1629
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,600
She she's another one that she knew to send

1630
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:06,500
Afterwards the second DVD by the way who uses DVDs anymore

1631
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:11,020
She of all people should know that USB pens are the way forward

1632
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:15,540
Hey, remember the plot of Sherlock the story's twists undercut itself by trying to have you know

1633
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,260
An interesting story that ties together well

1634
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:22,780
But then having Moriarty turn out to have nothing to do with it all or having Sherlock successfully track Mary only

1635
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:28,300
It's just a tracking device or having the assassin be trying to kill Mary for something from her dark past except it turns out

1636
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:34,060
She did nothing wrong this endless twisting and untwisting runs through season 4 to such a degree that you can never be certain of anything

1637
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,780
And this makes you unable to give a shit about any of it

1638
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:43,300
Also, this is the second time now in two seasons or two slash three episodes depending how you count it the Sherlock completely

1639
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:48,460
Coincidentally stumbled into a story that directly concerns Mary while trying to do something else

1640
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,500
Would it really have been that hard to tie things together?

1641
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:57,620
Case in point with the twisting and untwisting you have Mary have this dark past right like her whole thing is she used to do

1642
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:02,380
Some bad stuff. So then when someone from her dark past is looking for a seeking revenge. You're like, oh

1643
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:08,060
This is the comeuppance for that. This is an interesting thing to explore. But then it's like now she didn't do anything wrong

1644
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,660
she was fine, she was actually his friend she was good all the time and

1645
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,180
He's mistaken

1646
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:17,800
So I guess that's fucked the villain of episode 2 is Culverton Smith

1647
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,820
There's no evidence that he's a criminal

1648
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:26,980
But you begin the episode knowing he's a bad guy because his daughter says to Sherlock that she remembers him

1649
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,580
Saying he's a murderer. So we already have his confession

1650
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:37,540
Then it twists and says our she was fake. But then within about five minutes it untwists because he did do it. So

1651
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:45,380
Again was the fucking point and then it turns out that he didn't hallucinate that woman. She was actually his secret sister in disguise. Oh

1652
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:48,340
Fuck they actually wrote that that wasn't

1653
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,540
Jesus fucking Christ

1654
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:56,420
One thing they could have immediately done to improve this season is have the untwist not happen

1655
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,740
Like have the guy who's trying to get revenge on Mary

1656
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:06,820
Actually have justifiable reasons for trying to kill her like maybe she did betray him or maybe have Sherlock

1657
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,900
actually hallucinate a

1658
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:16,680
Confession and Culverton Smith is innocent have an episode dedicated to Sherlock's actual breakdown instead of him obviously faking it

1659
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:23,180
Which it's obvious because you already know he's bad because even after it turns out that

1660
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,580
He hasn't actually met his daughter before

1661
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,620
Within like a couple of minutes there. He is saying nah now you're right

1662
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:34,780
I'm the bad guy, but no instead they always make sure that the characters are a hundred percent, right?

1663
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,580
Mary never betrayed anyone and was very reliable and

1664
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:45,060
Sherlock did not hallucinate and it was all pretend and he was right all along even though a couple things turned out to be

1665
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:50,100
Not what he thought they were and it's just oh well fuck off then the characters aren't really being challenged

1666
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,180
We were told that Sherlock was right in the first five minutes, and it turned out to be right so

1667
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,520
What was the point of the last hour and 25 minutes?

1668
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,380
They never explain of course how Sherlock's sister figured out that Culverton Smith was a villain because you just have to assume

1669
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:07,180
She's a super genius who figured out with magic. Why did any of this happen?

1670
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:11,980
Why did his sister pretend to be Culverton Smith's daughter in order to make Sherlock catch him?

1671
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:17,260
Why did she pretend to be Watson's therapist? Why did she flirt with Watson in disguise?

1672
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,100
making funny face

1673
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,100
I think I'll put a hole in it

1674
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:31,260
Why does she say I'll put a hole in his head and then it turns out she just tranquilized him

1675
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:38,240
Why does she do anything well because like Moriarty she wants to test Sherlock or play with him or just

1676
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:44,440
You know mess with his head or something just because why is she doing it now?

1677
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:52,220
But everything is compounded in the final episode an episode so bad that even the show's greatest fans

1678
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:57,940
Wish it was fake just to set up how fucking bullshit this episode is

1679
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:04,500
Let me explain the opening in detail a girl wakes up on a plane everyone else on it is out cold or dead

1680
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:10,100
She looks around her. There's no one to help. She's in trouble a phone rings, and she hears Moriarty

1681
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,660
This is a fairly okay set up isn't it by the end of this episode Moriarty is still dead it turns out

1682
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,800
That's just a recording

1683
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:33,140
but also it isn't even a recording and isn't playing to anyone because none of this is happening because it's all just a fantasy story

1684
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:39,940
By Sherlock's sister that she's making up and telling Sherlock perhaps the only thing sadder than the lost special theorists are the people who are like

1685
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:43,140
Oh, no, there's loads of really deep stuff going on in the background

1686
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:48,020
Let me explain to you how it's secretly very smart so like a plane full of dead people

1687
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,660
except one girl with zero clues suggesting that the adults may be

1688
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:55,780
Inhaled or ingested something that the girl didn't or any

1689
01:26:56,180 --> 01:27:00,940
Explanations for how this plane could stay airborne for several hours with no one flying it

1690
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:07,780
I don't think we were ever meant to interpret this literally the show wanted us to doubt the authenticity of all this see they

1691
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:13,980
Certainly imply. This is a fake story by having there be hints in the form of the story being so ridiculous. It's impossible to believe

1692
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:21,820
Listen I hate to burst your bubble, but those aren't really hints at all. This is the sort of crazy stupid bullshit

1693
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:27,300
We've been expected to believe over the course of this entire fucking show in one episode

1694
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,220
It turned out a boomerang did it and in that same episode?

1695
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:39,180
Mycroft's plan literally involved making an entire plane full of dead people this literally fucking happened in the fucking show

1696
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:43,940
And suddenly we're supposed to cotton on to how unrealistic it is now

1697
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,060
Fuck off

1698
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,620
Fuck off

1699
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:52,620
Stop it, please stop trying to trick people into thinking this bullshit was smart

1700
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:58,580
Please the show opens with a relatively interesting setup and it concludes by telling you it made all of it up

1701
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:04,100
And it's a lie, and that's the running theme of this episode nay this season nay this entire show

1702
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:09,420
Relatively clever setups that imply something cool is gonna happen, and then it's fucking

1703
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,260
Undoes itself

1704
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:17,340
Mycroft is chased around by a fucking clown and his pictures start to bleed out of the eyes and you're like oh fuck

1705
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,300
What the hell is happening? Oh, it's just Sherlock messing with him. Oh, okay?

1706
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:27,060
Oh, well Sherlock's on the trail of Moriarty's secret gang trying to find oh no

1707
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:32,820
It's not oh my god a DVD with a message on it. This might be the final message from Moriarty. No. It's not oh my god

1708
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:37,180
Sherlock actually hallucinated a confession, and he actually has a problem no no holy shit

1709
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:42,020
Did Mary betray her oldest friends and comrades no don't worry? She didn't know it's fine

1710
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,940
How Holmes and Watson gonna get out of that he walks out he walks out holy shit

1711
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:53,020
Who's this fucking shady guy who just abducted Watson? Oh, it's his brother and everything's fine doesn't matter who cares holy shit

1712
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:56,820
They just fucking killed off Sherlock. How are they good? Oh? He's fine. Oh all right?

1713
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:02,180
Oh my god Moriarty's back, and he's got some cool plan and he can hack all the things in London. No he can't

1714
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,180
He's not even in this story

1715
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:09,100
What makes season four in particular so disliked by fans

1716
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:14,860
Isn't that it's that much worse than the rest of the show although it is it's that at this point people are starting to realize

1717
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:17,100
That all these setups will have no payoff

1718
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:20,140
Anyway back to the episode at hand Sherlock

1719
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,820
Mycroft and Eurus Holmes are all super geniuses right

1720
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:29,380
Eurus is set up to be so amazingly mega smart even as a kid that she got too smart and became a psycho murderer that

1721
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:36,940
Sherlock forgot about because it was too traumatic the final episode is guess what season 1 episode 3 again with Eurus taking the place

1722
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,420
Of Moriarty who it turns out she learned about

1723
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:46,500
somehow and asked to meet five years ago and got recordings of for this test that she planned years in advance and also possibly

1724
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:50,820
Programmed Moriarty to want to play with Sherlock herself all those years ago

1725
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:54,460
But you'll never really know because the writers seemingly neither know nor care

1726
01:29:54,500 --> 01:30:00,340
There are plenty of plot holes in this episode for how a character knew something or how they knew something could possibly have happened years

1727
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:02,860
In advance or any of the choices that they made

1728
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,260
But at this point the writers can write it off with well

1729
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:11,740
They're geniuses and they're attuned to every data point and they know everything and they're so much smarter than you the viewer

1730
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:18,580
Making the characters this amazingly intelligent gives the writers a get-out-of-jail-free card from having to justify or explain

1731
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:24,860
Anything in a tangible way that a normal person could follow and the answer is fuck you

1732
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:31,420
They're smart the episode ends with the revelation that Sherlock has yet another blocked person in his memory a double secret person

1733
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,460
he extra forgot a

1734
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:40,460
Childhood friend who he remembers as a dog. One of the things that characterizes the home stories is that we know

1735
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:43,260
Virtually nothing about Sherlock Holmes

1736
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:50,540
and I'm curious if Benedict and Stephen and Mark Gatiss spent any time on the backstory of

1737
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:54,500
Sherlock and Mycroft and their antecedents

1738
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:59,540
No, I don't think you know a character by creating a backstory for them

1739
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:04,620
We sometimes speculate because we're interested in you chat about it what his parents were like what he did

1740
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:10,220
But you know what? We're not it's it's sacred turf. You don't you don't mess that up

1741
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,660
You don't you don't bring that into the show. It's not right

1742
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:15,940
There are some things we don't know about Sherlock Holmes

1743
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:20,900
Just as there are some things we don't know about our friends and we don't ever know them and then that's right and proper

1744
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,060
I think if we went and did something like in a way the audience wouldn't believe it

1745
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,980
It's a now you've made that bit up. Okay, I'm gonna be honest here

1746
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:33,900
I was just looking through old interview footage to find b-roll to use for a later section where I talk more about Moffat and

1747
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:42,140
Accidentally stumbled upon this smoking gun where Moffat's like if we decide to stop and get into Sherlock's backstory

1748
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:49,900
Maybe we're doing something wrong. This interview did not age well and also Eurus made up the girl on the plane

1749
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:54,900
He was trying to save the whole episode and then Sherlock hugs her because at this point

1750
01:31:54,900 --> 01:32:01,020
It's easier than figuring out what she actually wants or why she did it and plays of the violin until she's happy

1751
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:02,980
the end

1752
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:07,540
It's actually pretty believable that fans who stuck with this episode all the way through would assume

1753
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,180
This episode was some kind of fake trick

1754
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:16,220
This season is so bad killing off the most interesting addition to the story so far adding in not one

1755
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:22,540
But two secret forgotten people constantly parading Moriarty around as if he's just on the fringes about to come back

1756
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:27,220
But actually he's basically not in it at all that basically everyone thinks it's utter shite

1757
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:31,380
The saddest thing is even though I could talk the longest about the problems of season 4

1758
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,220
Nobody needs me to tell them that season 4 is bad. You know the first three seasons

1759
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:41,540
they're only really bad if you care about the Sherlock mythos or are paying attention or want a compelling story or

1760
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:48,060
like to think about things, you know, you can turn your brain off and have a pretty fun time watching Benedict Cumberbatch and

1761
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,060
It's Martin McBacon

1762
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,900
talk about the stuff they're doing and

1763
01:32:55,060 --> 01:33:01,180
Watch the camera spin season 4 is so bad that you don't need to perform any analysis whatsoever to recognize how shite it is

1764
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:08,180
So I'm basically out of a job. Like I said, the backlash isn't just a reaction to this season though. It's more than that

1765
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,300
It's a reaction to the deeper

1766
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:16,540
Realization this season brings about the entire show if there's one thing this show was always good at one thing Moffat as a writer

1767
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:21,900
Always did it's keep you thinking an explanation was coming that the show was going to get good

1768
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:26,820
The main way he does this is with cliffhangers and endings that suddenly imply more is going on

1769
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:32,780
The show's bread-and-butter is revealed to have always been implying the show is about to turn out to be deep

1770
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:40,300
Implying characterization and backstory that's way more interesting than what ends up on the screen after four seasons and a special of implying

1771
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:46,580
People started to realize they were being played the drug of this manipulative writing style started to wear off

1772
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:51,060
Fans of the series have been pretty rough on season 4 and while it deserves all of it

1773
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,340
The preceding show deserved a lot of it too

1774
01:33:53,340 --> 01:34:00,140
But because they hadn't yet realized they were being played people thought those ones were better. Well, sorry go back and check

1775
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:04,420
This is why I brought up the secret good fourth Sherlock episode theory

1776
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:10,820
Because the show has rung a dozen hours of content out of telling you the audience all about future good episodes

1777
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:16,020
But you don't actually get to see instead of giving you any the fans who want that new episode

1778
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:20,380
Simply take more seriously than anyone else the promise they were made by this show

1779
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:25,060
Which by the way is increasingly difficult to do because of the show's very clear

1780
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,900
Attitude to the people who want to think about it if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes stories

1781
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:34,780
Stephen Moffat and his co-writers hate you if you're a fan of Sherlock the show

1782
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:39,820
Moffat wants you dead if you actually want to understand what is happening in the story

1783
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,900
Stephen Moffat calls you a stupid piece of shit

1784
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:47,180
Repeatedly in the show this hatred doesn't just manifest in

1785
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:53,380
Insulting wankery like having it turn out to be a fucking boomerang or in deliberately rewriting one of the first

1786
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:59,100
Proto-feminist icons in crime fiction to be a sexy kung-fu dominatrix in love with the main character

1787
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:04,900
But in how the show directly tells you that if you're a fan, you should personally go and fuck yourself

1788
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:09,080
When they reveal a couple of minutes after killing him that Sherlock's still alive

1789
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:15,540
They purposefully don't explain how he survived so that people could speculate about it for the years leading into season 3

1790
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,300
But guess what?

1791
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,660
They never explain it

1792
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:18,220
in fact

1793
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:25,100
season 3 features several characters whose sole job is to portray fan theories and theorists and make fun of them and call them stupid for

1794
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:30,500
Bothering to try and figure out what happened based on the information given to them by the show now

1795
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,300
I just want to be clear on something a lot of the theories about how Sherlock survived were dumb

1796
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:38,940
Not as dumb as the secret good extra season 4 episode theory, but dumb

1797
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:43,060
However, the people coming up with these elaborate theories are the true fans of the show

1798
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:50,740
They're the real audience the people who care enough to push through the stupid plotting and lack of real mysteries because Sherlock solves them with magic

1799
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,740
To actually try and piece things together

1800
01:35:53,100 --> 01:36:00,300
People trying to figure out the mystery of the mystery story are presented as a little club of weirdos being weird together

1801
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:06,300
the creator of the story appears to be so fundamentally incapable of recognizing how to tell a

1802
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:10,580
Mystery that he's perceived people treating it like one as insane

1803
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:17,300
They even have one of the perspective theories be that Holmes and Moriarty were gay lovers who faked it together and even the other

1804
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:19,180
Theorists make fun of her for that

1805
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:23,660
even though the same people writing this scene to make fun of that are also the people who

1806
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:29,460
Purposefully queer baited the fuck out of the relationships between Holmes and Watson and Holmes and Moriarty

1807
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:35,060
They spend a huge chunk of this episode literally calling people stupid for reading into the story's clear

1808
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:40,900
Intentional subtext instead of you know, writing better text first off

1809
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:45,820
I want to say give a shout out to all of my UK tumblr friends for staying up very late to watch this right now

1810
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,300
um

1811
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:56,140
The episode resolves with the main theorist played by a Lindybeige impersonator being told by Sherlock what he actually did

1812
01:36:56,180 --> 01:37:02,900
But then maybe it turns out Sherlock isn't there and he's losing his mind and the last we see of this character is him laughing

1813
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:08,100
Maniacally with his conspiracy theory wall like a loser. Did you want to know how Sherlock did the thing?

1814
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:11,580
Did you expect the story to actually tell you this is you?

1815
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:18,460
Fuck you the actual correct answer that's positioned by John Watson is that you're not supposed to care

1816
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:24,900
I don't care how you faked it Sherlock. I want to know why it doesn't matter how he did it

1817
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:31,320
You should only care about why you're not supposed to care how a thing happened in a fucking

1818
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,740
fucking crime

1819
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,700
mystery story

1820
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:40,740
Literally a fucking series of books about figuring out how things happen

1821
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:42,740
and

1822
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:49,940
This shit this shit like with the boomerang scene or the I did a bunch of stuff

1823
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:54,920
You don't know about scene is a blatant disregard for the core appeal of crime

1824
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:57,840
mystery stories heck stories

1825
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:05,300
It's so disgustingly wrong on almost every level and so hateful towards people for expecting things to make sense

1826
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:09,420
And trying to form a theory out of what they were shown that it's almost avant-garde

1827
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:13,660
Instead of bothering to use the couple of hours they get every two years

1828
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:19,420
They get to tell a compelling story. They're basically calling people who like the show

1829
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,820
Stupid for thinking about it that takes balls

1830
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:29,500
Moffat and Gant is a seemingly above the idea of people wanting to solve the mystery

1831
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:37,020
They're being presented with because they're so far up their own asses writing about clever people who just know and you're supposed to accept

1832
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:38,660
That as a story

1833
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:44,860
They solve it because they're smart and that's not even getting into the sheer contempt for the source material

1834
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:50,460
Rewriting one of the most interesting characters in the mythos and one of the few people who ever beats Sherlock

1835
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:55,020
So that she's not interesting because she's just the villain and then doesn't beat him is

1836
01:38:55,700 --> 01:39:01,220
Apocalyptically bad, but it's just a tip of a gigantic iceberg made of frozen

1837
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,140
We in the hounds of Baskerville

1838
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:10,180
they're too special to simply have a big dog people are scared of and a local legend being abused so someone can claim an

1839
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,860
Inheritance by offing their relatives

1840
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:20,020
No that world famous story on the UK's best-loved novel list the best Holmes novel ever written as rated by Sherlock fans

1841
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:27,740
Was too dumb and simple and understandable what it really needed was a drug that makes you hallucinate and a secret government research facility and

1842
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:30,300
Pointless intrigue with Sherlock sneaking into a facility

1843
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,020
He could easily have asked his fucking brother to let him into which he does later anyway

1844
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:38,180
And the only reason there's a hound in the story at all is because the word hound

1845
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:42,820
Happened to be written on the killers shirt when he killed a kid's father

1846
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:47,700
So the kid hallucinated a giant dog and yet while they're trying to gussy up this

1847
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:51,380
Famous story to make it more cleverer with this bullshit

1848
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:56,660
They don't even bother explaining why the killer didn't just kill the only witness to his fucking crime

1849
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:00,660
There's this core mismatch in the sensibility of the story's authors

1850
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:03,620
They don't just hate you for wanting to solve a mystery

1851
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:11,340
They seemingly hate mystery stories themselves for being too understandable having too many simple pleasures like

1852
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:13,580
Watching a story unfold

1853
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:19,140
Moffat and Gatiss decided that shit wouldn't fly anymore and it had to be fixed by over

1854
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:25,940
Complicating it and adding in a secret facility. I wonder if Moffat's made this fucking mistake in an adaptation before

1855
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:30,340
Rache, German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us something. Yes. Thank you for your input

1856
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:35,780
Find out who Rachel is. She was writing Rachel. No, she was leaving an angry note in German

1857
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:37,380
Of course she was writing Rachel

1858
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:43,460
Oh, wow, they straight up have Sherlock dismiss the twist from the original story as being stupid and for idiots great

1859
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Thanks

1860
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:50,980
Listen Steve, I know you're listening because

1861
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:56,540
What else you're gonna be doing with your fucking time now that you're not running Doctor Who and probably not gonna get another season of

1862
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:02,540
This if you think you're too smart for the simple pulpy crime stories that make up a famous property

1863
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:09,580
You're adapting and you think they need to be fixed. Why are you adapting them in the first place the Sherlock fandom?

1864
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:14,020
the people who make gifts of all the romantic moments between Sherlock and Watson with the

1865
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:18,660
Saturation slightly raised to make the image pop and also fix the show's own shit

1866
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:24,820
Wank color grading the people who actually believe enough pieces of the puzzle are there to explain how Sherlock survived

1867
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:30,300
the people who actually liked the show enough to not believe season 4 was as bad as it was and

1868
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:34,180
There had to be an episode that explained why it was pretending to be shit

1869
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:40,460
The only people who will stick with Sherlock all the way through and actually profess to enjoying it are these people

1870
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:46,860
These people fully believe the promise of the show that it really will one day be good and smart and pull back the curtain to

1871
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:50,620
Reveal an amazing true narrative kept hidden all this time that had always been there

1872
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:56,260
It's so easy to make fun of people for coming up with that silly theory. In fact, I've done that and you should too

1873
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:03,940
It's stupid, but it's honest. It's the truest expression of being told over and over that something was coming. It's gonna get good

1874
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:06,660
There's a real secret thing going on in the background

1875
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:09,420
All these people did was take that seriously

1876
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:15,220
But in reality, they were simply lied to the reality is a show that keeps telling you

1877
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:21,580
I know it's bad, but I promise eventually it'll get good or turn out to have always been smart after four seasons

1878
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,420
It's just a bad show

1879
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:28,340
The old books and serials were designed to keep you reading or watching and coming back for more

1880
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:33,980
When Sherlock went over the Reichenbach Falls with Moriarty and the final problem threatened to live up to its name

1881
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:36,180
There was a public outcry

1882
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:43,340
people wanted more their appetite fed by the format of the story and love for the character a full decade later still

1883
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:49,500
Hounded pardon the pun by fans of his greatest work who still didn't care that much for his historical novels

1884
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,060
Doyle had no choice

1885
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:58,300
But to have Holmes return the new show kills Sherlock and within a few minutes of mourning him tells you it's okay

1886
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:03,340
He's fine. No one would clamor for this Sherlock's resurrection a decade later

1887
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:07,260
They had to make sure you knew he wasn't really dead

1888
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:12,700
Because otherwise you wouldn't have given a shit about a next series and would have moved on with your life

1889
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:16,420
They needed you to be speculating for years about how he did it

1890
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:20,460
Even though later they planned on telling you you were a fucking idiot for doing it

1891
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:24,100
It's been ten years since Jekyll came out and ended on a cliffhanger

1892
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:28,500
Is anyone hounding Moffat to bring back that beloved story?

1893
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,180
No

1894
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:36,740
It's not beloved Moffat is handing off the running of Doctor Who to someone else and he said in interviews that he wants to simply

1895
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,580
Leave the show better than he found it for someone else to take over

1896
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:45,540
Well, guess what Steve? We'd have all liked if you'd done that too. Doctor Who was a silly weird and

1897
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:52,180
Fantastic show that went off the air in 1989 and people remembered it wanted more of it for so long

1898
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:57,340
To the point that almost 20 years later people wanted the show to return

1899
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:05,020
Cared about seeing what happened next like Sherlock Holmes before it the creators of Doctor Who crafted a character and series

1900
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:10,740
So good so iconic that not even a long absence could kill the love for what they had made

1901
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:17,220
After a few short years of running Doctor Who even Moffat can't wait to be gone

1902
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:24,340
Moffat will be remembered forever for his contributions to the show when someone else ran it when he was just on the edge making the

1903
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:28,540
Best bits forced to tell a complete story and deliver on the promises

1904
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:35,000
He was making instead of endlessly delaying the time things get good until people realize it isn't and never will and no

1905
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:40,780
One can tell him what to do because the executive producers are him his co-writer and his mother-in-law

1906
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:44,820
Many of the previous Holmes adaptations are straightforwardly written and shot

1907
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:49,380
There's a whole lot of flat shots of people talking the camera never turns and reveals

1908
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,440
They actually built a set in the middle of London, and it's a dream sequence

1909
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:57,180
But I would rather watch Sherlock figure things out by sitting and looking at things

1910
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:01,460
We also see and deriving a better explanation than I could with the same information

1911
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:06,700
Any day of the week then sit through another second of self-indulgent look at me

1912
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,420
I'm so clever spinny camera nonsense that reveals

1913
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:14,620
It was probably just a fucking boomerang the new Sherlock thinks it's so much better more

1914
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:22,780
Important and smarter than the mystery stories. It's based on that it cuts out everything that defines them leaving only shameless queer baiting

1915
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:28,700
Pretentious overarching stories that never arrive anywhere and the false assurance that somehow

1916
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:32,340
Someday all of this will make sense and arrive at an entertaining

1917
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:37,420
Conclusion that ties everything together and proves you weren't wasting all this fucking time watching it

1918
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:41,100
But the sad truth is you were I'm honestly

1919
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:43,620
disappointed by

1920
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:48,940
this work and in a writer who I had a lot of respect for and honestly, I I

1921
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,800
Just think that's a shame. I really do

1922
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:58,020
Also Benedict Cumberbatch is a terrible actor and his face is stupid

1923
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:01,700
I

1924
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:07,900
Hey, thanks for watching this video all the way through to the end. I really appreciate it another thing

1925
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:12,820
I really appreciate is being able to afford to take the time to make stuff like this and for that

1926
