00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Hello, friends and people who come to my channel just to dislike the videos and then run away.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,680
I've just been sent a new video about the Alt-Right Dogs trailer by Karl Yushchenko,

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,680
and people keep asking me to watch it or to react to it, so I figured I would set up a

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,280
camera because apparently how I feel about this trailer is going to be important.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,160
I don't know why, but let's find out, shall we?

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm using my laptop because, for unknown reasons, my iMac hasn't been working particularly well lately.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,040
So, uh, yeah. Anyway.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,440
This is the opening of, uh, Reservoir Dogs, isn't it? Yeah.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, Alt-Right Dogs. I get it.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Wait, why would the Alt-Right want to reference fucking Tarantino?

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,040
He does not have views that are agreeable to you.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,680
I have nothing against white nationalism.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,480
Oh no, Colonel Hans Lander disliked my videos.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,000
Hans Lander's such a moral, upstanding character whose opinion is worthy of respect.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,480
Is that... is that Matt Forney?

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Man, that guy's out of shape.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,720
He looks really upset. Is he being filmed surreptitiously?

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Is this made by someone who's not a fan of these people?

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,920
Ah, the original film had, like, cool slow-motion close-ups, and these are just stills from a video.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,840
Is Johan the character or the actor playing him?

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
What? Who?

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,400
You know, there were more Reservoir Dogs, so this was a more interesting thing to watch.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Davis? What? Why does he get a real picture?

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
What? What?

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
But there was four of them, right? Wasn't there...

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Davis is...

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, fuck!

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,480
There's five of them, but no one else was around to hold the camera.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
It's just...

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Oh, shit.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,280
Okay, so Davis isn't in this shot, which means that he's the cameraman for this bit.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
So why is there a black border on the left?

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
What? What?

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,960
Davis, hold the camera steady! You're supposed to be a real director! No!

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
Goddammit!

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,760
Why couldn't the All Right Dogs find a tripod or a friend to fucking hold the camera for them?

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
God! Is there not even in the center of the frame?

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
What?

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Oh, God!

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Look, Davis...

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Get in touch with me, Davis, and I will send you this tripod.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
It's not very good, but it means that all five of you will be in the frame.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
This is fucking so...

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm gonna watch it again.

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
So what is this a trailer for?

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Are they making...

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Are they making a Reservoir Dogs?

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Did they just want to broadcast how badass they are to the world?

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Because it totally worked.

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I can't believe that there are five All Right Dogs,

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
and, like, they didn't have any friends who would hold the camera for them.

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,640
You know, the actual Reservoir Dogs trailer had footage of them, like, doing stuff.

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,640
They weren't just, like, taking the crosswalk outside McDonald's.

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,640
They were, like, doing stuff from the film to try and sell you on it.

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
This is just...

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
This is just piss.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Oh, here it comes. Yeah.

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
I have a feel that if they had slightly more budget,

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
at that point, they would cut Matt Forney

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
shot and bleeding to death in the back of Davis' car

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,320
that he bought with the Sarkeesian effect money.

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Why is the footage misaligned like that?

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
You would have to do that on purpose.

64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Like, what?

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Davis Arini, the cameraman for this footage,

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
thinks he's a filmmaker.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's very sure he's a real filmmaker.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Slow motion shaky cam is just the most...

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's just the most rational thing, you know?

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, all in all, it's not the worst trailer Davis has been involved with,

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but it's pretty up there.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
By the way, who is Carl Eushanka?

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to see what Eushanka US is.

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm actually kind of interested now.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
I just want to go to eushanka.us.

76
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Please, just take me to...

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I don't want to set up parental controls.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Alright, blog.eushanka.us is...

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Hold on a sec.

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,680
This is the guy who makes the eushankas that Davis has been selling

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
on his fucking blog for years!

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Holy shit!

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
What?

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
The collusion is real!

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Advertise my hats on your blog, Davis,

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
and I'll give you a part in Alt-Right Dogs, the trailer.

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm willing to bet that if I checked,

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,360
one of the other guys would be the guy behind the testosterone cream

89
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
and the other shit that he advertises on his blog.

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Let's see what he's selling right now.

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Support my Patreon.

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Buy my Fallout fanfiction.

93
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Please watch Lust in the Time of Heartache.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
My full-length documentary on game-negate social-justice-Marxist narcissism

95
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
and Anita Sarkeesian.

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
He's a professional on one of those topics.

97
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
And, of course, Karl Eushanka's glorious hat.

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
It's stylish. It's warm.

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
It drives liberals nuts.

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Well, I guess I am nuts, but not because of your hat.

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
I think the hat is really funny, and you should wear it constantly.

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Confessions of an Online Hustler by Matt Forney.

103
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,040
He's just using his blog to sell, like, the shit of his four other friends.

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
BachelorPad Economics by Aaron!

105
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Who'd have thought?

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,720
He's also trying to sell Roosh V's latest book,

107
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,720
but Roosh, I guess, couldn't make the time to appear in his really badass film trailer.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Is PayPal joining Google and Twitter in the censorship war?

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm gonna read this.

110
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Okay, Davis has had minor trouble with how PayPal works,

111
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
which is understandable. That happens to literally everyone.

112
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
It's happened to me.

113
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,400
But he appears to think that it means they've taken a side in an internet censorship war?

114
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I mean, okay.

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Also, he feels the need to specifically point out that the person he was talking to on the phone was a girl.

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
As if, like, you needed to know that.

117
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
I wonder why.

118
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
The girl, and you know what they're like,

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
claimed that their investigations aren't motivated by the same sort of political bias

120
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are exhibiting.

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
What, did you call her on the phone and say,

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Are you like Twitter? Are you out to get me?

123
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Matt Forney, whose book is literally right next to this fucking post,

124
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
suspects, and I agree, that this might be the first step in kicking me off their platform.

125
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Oh wow, he actually does think PayPal is out to get him.

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
The fact that all these companies are resorting to such tactics is good news for our side.

127
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Yeah, it's good that you're getting kicked off of all these platforms, apparently.

128
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,760
It means they're running scared, and it means that they consider me dangerous.

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I've got some weird PayPal issues as well,

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,760
and a lot of people do because PayPal is actually not very good.

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
That doesn't mean PayPal is scared of you,

132
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
it just means it's a bit crap.

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
There's nothing that makes me happier than being hated by the unrighteous.

134
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Nobody hates you, Davis.

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
I think you're amazing.

136
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Only time will tell what PayPal's actually up to.

137
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Cue the X-Files theme.

138
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Honestly, I'm not too worried about it.

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Unlike some people I could mention,

140
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I have avenues available to-

141
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I have avenues available to me outside of YouTube Benjamins and the public dole.

142
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,440
And by this time next year, I hope to be a contributor to the various alt-right voices whom I enjoy.

143
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Assuming that they're still able to receive PayPal, of course.

144
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
I still haven't figured out how to Bitcoin!

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Hahahaha!

146
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Of course, you're more than free to include your questions, prayer requests,

147
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
or ideas for videos when you donate.

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Prayer requests?

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
Wait, is he-

150
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh, was that a joke?

151
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Or can I get Davis to pray for me?

152
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Because I need that, I need that right now.

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Davis, if you manage to watch this far,

154
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
and I know you're rational so you did,

155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
um,

156
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I will send you a tripod

157
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
in exchange for footage of you praying for my soul.

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Please do this. Please.

159
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
He links to an article called,

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
in the text bar at the top,

161
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Egoistic Self-Destruction Thunderf00t Sargon of Akkad.

162
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
So he's very angry about certain other reasonable people.

163
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Pfft.

164
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Over the past summer, first Thunderf00t,

165
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Phil Tinas Mason,

166
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
and then Sargon of Akkad, Carl Benjamin,

167
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,800
self-immolated through acts of e-fame driven hubris,

168
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Mason revealed himself as the big government

169
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,480
anti-Brexit globalist who wants your tax dollars to pay for his hobby,

170
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
while Benjamin repeatedly invaded alt-right spaces

171
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
only to dominate the conversation with first-year communist rhetoric.

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
The best thing about the alt-right is that if you just wait long enough,

173
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
they'll fall out with each other,

174
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,480
and then come tell you why they're shit.

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
You don't even have to criticize them,

176
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,480
they'll do it themselves when they realize that they hate each other.

177
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,480
I have to admit it was rather gratifying.

178
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Last year, the two of them went on a slanderous attack campaign against-

179
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Hold on a sec.

180
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Last year, the two of them went on a slanderous attack campaign against me,

181
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
misquoting an alt-right lying.

182
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
They had no regard for the morality of their actions,

183
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
nor the real politic consequences of attacking a Gamergate ally.

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Gamergate is still important in 2016, guys.

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Please, please believe me.

186
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Thunderf00t, the establishment skeptic.

187
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,160
He'll obsessively pick apart anything that doesn't matter in your day-to-day life.

188
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Evolution, hoverboards, and solar roadways,

189
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,840
while ignoring existential threats that demand a skeptical eye.

190
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Global warming, yep.

191
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
James Watson,

192
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
and over-vaccination.

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Sargon of Akkad, aka Marxus of Boobus.

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I've expressed my disappointment with Gamergate in the past,

195
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,840
how it went from being a stalwart defense in the culture war,

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
to being about ethics in games journalism,

197
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
to being nothing more than another equality movement,

198
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,520
nothing but a bunch of castrated jackals who thought themselves clever.

199
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
These are the people who were giving you money, Davis.

200
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
You really shouldn't piss off these people.

201
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,520
I like that he complains that it went from a defense in the culture war,

202
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
to being about ethics in game journalism.

203
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Like, wasn't it supposed to have always been about ethics?

204
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Aren't you kind of showing your hand here that it was just an alt-right dog whistle the whole time?

205
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Oops.

206
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
The people who matter know who and what Phil and Carl actually are,

207
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
so there's no need for me to waste any more time on them,

208
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
beyond this short blog post.

209
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah, yeah, of course.

210
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm not gonna waste my time on them, but let me continue briefly!

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
I poured my heart and soul into that movie.

212
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You know what, here's the thing, is,

213
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
if I had ever watched any of her fucking videos,

214
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I could have come up with a far tighter argument.

215
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
If things had turned out differently, it really could have had an impact.

216
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,880
If the film had been good and contained facts, it would have made a huge difference.

217
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Don't get me wrong, Immersed in Subversion is something I'm genuinely proud of.

218
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Well, that's your first mistake!

219
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,880
It's not just a good film in spite of the circumstances,

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
it's a bloody good film, period.

221
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
The problem with it isn't the film itself, it's the fact that it's on YouTube.

222
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,880
As Marshall McLuhan said, the medium is the message.

223
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,880
And no matter how good the film is, it's nothing but a YouTube movie,

224
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
as far as most people are concerned.

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
The whole point of filming it was to get it onto Netflix!

226
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Without that appearance of endorsement by the assumed experts at Netflix,

227
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,560
it's about as useful as a sports car at the bottom of the ocean.

228
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
What?

229
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Mate, I appreciate the reference, I'm a McLuhanist myself,

230
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,560
there's a copy of The Mechanical Bride in that box of books over there somewhere.

231
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,560
But, let's be honest here, your film isn't bad because it's not on Netflix.

232
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,560
It's bad because it's fucking terrible!

233
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Everything's weirdly reframed because you accidentally had Jordan Owen in most of the shots,

234
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,560
and then you had a massive falling out with him, so you had to edit him out.

235
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Like, it's all complete weird decisions that make your point harder to get across.

236
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Like, it's exactly the sort of thing you would expect from the man who made the Alt-Right Dogs trailer.

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
If you think the people who run Netflix aren't good at their jobs,

238
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,560
why do you want it on Netflix? Why would you want to associate with them?

239
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
I would just declare that Netflix were running from me because they were afraid of the truth.

240
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
You know, like PayPal apparently are, because you don't know what their rules are.

241
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,560
And with that in mind, let's finish this piece by considering the crucial flaw which brought these men low,

242
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
so that we ourselves do not repeat it.

243
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Their sin was ego.

244
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,560
In the analysis I linked above, they delineate the three main strategies that are used against us.

245
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Containment, dilution, and poisoning.

246
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
And ego.

247
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Those aren't...

248
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
That's not three things, Davis.

249
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Because this is the internet and half of you are autistic,

250
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,560
did you get that statistic from the place you get the rest of your facts?

251
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm going to lay out where I stand and why these are issues.

252
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Global warming, even if it is actually occurring, the solutions being offered won't do anything to combat it.

253
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,560
They're nothing more than Trojan horses for globalist control.

254
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,560
If you've recently come to a conclusion that I reached years ago,

255
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
maybe you ought to be listening to the crazy things I'm saying today.

256
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Just saying.

257
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Well, guess what, Davis?

258
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
I thought Sargon of Akkad was a bit weird when you were friends with him years ago.

259
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
So maybe you should be listening to what I'm saying today.

260
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
And I say maybe you should reconsider...

261
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,560
that global warming is a secret plot to take over the world.

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Maybe.

263
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
I've got to stop for now.

264
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
I'm absolutely busting for a piss.

265
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
But until next time,

266
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
your documentary doesn't contain facts until it's on Netflix.

267
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Milady.

268
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
These are absolutely covered in dust.

269
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
There's no credits in this video.

270
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm saving them for a thing that I'm doing later this month.

271
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Just trust me, alright?

272
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
It's going to be great.

273
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
That ushanka actually looks kind of crap.

274
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
I know where you could get some better ushankas,

275
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,560
but you probably wouldn't think much of that place.
