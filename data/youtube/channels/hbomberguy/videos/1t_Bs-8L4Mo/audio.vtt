00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
Hello, friends and people who come to my channel just to dislike the videos and then run away.

00:07.480 --> 00:12.680
I've just been sent a new video about the Alt-Right Dogs trailer by Karl Yushchenko,

00:12.680 --> 00:16.680
and people keep asking me to watch it or to react to it, so I figured I would set up a

00:16.680 --> 00:21.280
camera because apparently how I feel about this trailer is going to be important.

00:21.280 --> 00:26.160
I don't know why, but let's find out, shall we?

00:26.160 --> 00:32.040
I'm using my laptop because, for unknown reasons, my iMac hasn't been working particularly well lately.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.040
So, uh, yeah. Anyway.

00:40.720 --> 00:45.440
This is the opening of, uh, Reservoir Dogs, isn't it? Yeah.

00:45.440 --> 00:50.000
Oh, Alt-Right Dogs. I get it.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.840
Wait, why would the Alt-Right want to reference fucking Tarantino?

00:52.840 --> 00:56.040
He does not have views that are agreeable to you.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.680
I have nothing against white nationalism.

01:02.680 --> 01:06.480
Oh no, Colonel Hans Lander disliked my videos.

01:06.480 --> 01:12.000
Hans Lander's such a moral, upstanding character whose opinion is worthy of respect.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.480
Is that... is that Matt Forney?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.480
Man, that guy's out of shape.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.720
He looks really upset. Is he being filmed surreptitiously?

01:25.720 --> 01:28.720
Is this made by someone who's not a fan of these people?

01:31.480 --> 01:37.920
Ah, the original film had, like, cool slow-motion close-ups, and these are just stills from a video.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.840
Is Johan the character or the actor playing him?

01:40.840 --> 01:42.840
What? Who?

01:45.280 --> 01:50.400
You know, there were more Reservoir Dogs, so this was a more interesting thing to watch.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.080
Davis? What? Why does he get a real picture?

01:54.080 --> 01:56.080
What? What?

01:56.080 --> 01:58.080
But there was four of them, right? Wasn't there...

01:58.080 --> 02:00.080
Davis is...

02:00.080 --> 02:02.080
Oh, fuck!

02:02.080 --> 02:06.480
There's five of them, but no one else was around to hold the camera.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.480
It's just...

02:10.880 --> 02:12.880
Oh, shit.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.280
Okay, so Davis isn't in this shot, which means that he's the cameraman for this bit.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.360
So why is there a black border on the left?

02:20.360 --> 02:22.360
What? What?

02:22.360 --> 02:25.960
Davis, hold the camera steady! You're supposed to be a real director! No!

02:26.960 --> 02:28.360
Goddammit!

02:28.360 --> 02:34.760
Why couldn't the All Right Dogs find a tripod or a friend to fucking hold the camera for them?

02:35.960 --> 02:38.960
God! Is there not even in the center of the frame?

02:43.960 --> 02:45.960
What?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.960
Oh, God!

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
Look, Davis...

03:01.960 --> 03:04.960
Get in touch with me, Davis, and I will send you this tripod.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.960
It's not very good, but it means that all five of you will be in the frame.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.960
This is fucking so...

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
I'm gonna watch it again.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.960
So what is this a trailer for?

03:18.640 --> 03:20.640
Are they making...

03:20.640 --> 03:22.640
Are they making a Reservoir Dogs?

03:22.640 --> 03:24.640
Did they just want to broadcast how badass they are to the world?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.640
Because it totally worked.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.640
I can't believe that there are five All Right Dogs,

03:28.640 --> 03:32.640
and, like, they didn't have any friends who would hold the camera for them.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.640
You know, the actual Reservoir Dogs trailer had footage of them, like, doing stuff.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.640
They weren't just, like, taking the crosswalk outside McDonald's.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.640
They were, like, doing stuff from the film to try and sell you on it.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
This is just...

03:47.320 --> 03:49.320
This is just piss.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.320
Oh, here it comes. Yeah.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.320
I have a feel that if they had slightly more budget,

03:55.320 --> 03:57.320
at that point, they would cut Matt Forney

03:57.320 --> 04:00.320
shot and bleeding to death in the back of Davis' car

04:00.320 --> 04:03.320
that he bought with the Sarkeesian effect money.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.320
Why is the footage misaligned like that?

04:06.320 --> 04:08.320
You would have to do that on purpose.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.320
Like, what?

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Davis Arini, the cameraman for this footage,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
thinks he's a filmmaker.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
He's very sure he's a real filmmaker.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Slow motion shaky cam is just the most...

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
It's just the most rational thing, you know?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
I mean, all in all, it's not the worst trailer Davis has been involved with,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
but it's pretty up there.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
By the way, who is Carl Eushanka?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I want to see what Eushanka US is.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.680
I'm actually kind of interested now.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.680
I just want to go to eushanka.us.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.680
Please, just take me to...

04:47.680 --> 04:49.680
I don't want to set up parental controls.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.680
Alright, blog.eushanka.us is...

04:52.680 --> 04:54.680
Hold on a sec.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.680
This is the guy who makes the eushankas that Davis has been selling

04:57.680 --> 04:59.680
on his fucking blog for years!

05:00.680 --> 05:01.680
Holy shit!

05:01.680 --> 05:02.680
What?

05:02.680 --> 05:04.680
The collusion is real!

05:05.680 --> 05:07.680
Advertise my hats on your blog, Davis,

05:08.360 --> 05:10.360
and I'll give you a part in Alt-Right Dogs, the trailer.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.360
I'm willing to bet that if I checked,

05:13.360 --> 05:16.360
one of the other guys would be the guy behind the testosterone cream

05:16.360 --> 05:18.360
and the other shit that he advertises on his blog.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.360
Let's see what he's selling right now.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.360
Support my Patreon.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.360
Buy my Fallout fanfiction.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
Please watch Lust in the Time of Heartache.

05:26.360 --> 05:31.360
My full-length documentary on game-negate social-justice-Marxist narcissism

05:31.360 --> 05:33.360
and Anita Sarkeesian.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.360
He's a professional on one of those topics.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
And, of course, Karl Eushanka's glorious hat.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.040
It's stylish. It's warm.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
It drives liberals nuts.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.040
Well, I guess I am nuts, but not because of your hat.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.040
I think the hat is really funny, and you should wear it constantly.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.040
Confessions of an Online Hustler by Matt Forney.

05:53.040 --> 05:58.040
He's just using his blog to sell, like, the shit of his four other friends.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.040
BachelorPad Economics by Aaron!

06:01.040 --> 06:03.040
Who'd have thought?

06:03.720 --> 06:07.720
He's also trying to sell Roosh V's latest book,

06:07.720 --> 06:12.720
but Roosh, I guess, couldn't make the time to appear in his really badass film trailer.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.720
Is PayPal joining Google and Twitter in the censorship war?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.720
I'm gonna read this.

06:24.720 --> 06:30.720
Okay, Davis has had minor trouble with how PayPal works,

06:31.400 --> 06:33.400
which is understandable. That happens to literally everyone.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.400
It's happened to me.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.400
But he appears to think that it means they've taken a side in an internet censorship war?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
I mean, okay.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.400
Also, he feels the need to specifically point out that the person he was talking to on the phone was a girl.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
As if, like, you needed to know that.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
I wonder why.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
The girl, and you know what they're like,

06:54.400 --> 06:58.400
claimed that their investigations aren't motivated by the same sort of political bias

06:59.080 --> 07:01.080
that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are exhibiting.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.080
What, did you call her on the phone and say,

07:03.080 --> 07:06.080
Are you like Twitter? Are you out to get me?

07:06.080 --> 07:10.080
Matt Forney, whose book is literally right next to this fucking post,

07:10.080 --> 07:15.080
suspects, and I agree, that this might be the first step in kicking me off their platform.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.080
Oh wow, he actually does think PayPal is out to get him.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.080
The fact that all these companies are resorting to such tactics is good news for our side.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.080
Yeah, it's good that you're getting kicked off of all these platforms, apparently.

07:26.760 --> 07:30.760
It means they're running scared, and it means that they consider me dangerous.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.760
I've got some weird PayPal issues as well,

07:32.760 --> 07:36.760
and a lot of people do because PayPal is actually not very good.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.760
That doesn't mean PayPal is scared of you,

07:38.760 --> 07:40.760
it just means it's a bit crap.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.760
There's nothing that makes me happier than being hated by the unrighteous.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.760
Nobody hates you, Davis.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.760
I think you're amazing.

07:50.760 --> 07:54.760
Only time will tell what PayPal's actually up to.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.440
Cue the X-Files theme.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.440
Honestly, I'm not too worried about it.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.440
Unlike some people I could mention,

08:01.440 --> 08:03.440
I have avenues available to-

08:03.440 --> 08:08.440
I have avenues available to me outside of YouTube Benjamins and the public dole.

08:08.440 --> 08:13.440
And by this time next year, I hope to be a contributor to the various alt-right voices whom I enjoy.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.440
Assuming that they're still able to receive PayPal, of course.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.440
I still haven't figured out how to Bitcoin!

08:19.440 --> 08:21.440
Hahahaha!

08:22.120 --> 08:26.120
Of course, you're more than free to include your questions, prayer requests,

08:26.120 --> 08:28.120
or ideas for videos when you donate.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.120
Prayer requests?

08:30.120 --> 08:32.120
Wait, is he-

08:32.120 --> 08:34.120
Oh, was that a joke?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.120
Or can I get Davis to pray for me?

08:36.120 --> 08:39.120
Because I need that, I need that right now.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.120
Davis, if you manage to watch this far,

08:41.120 --> 08:43.120
and I know you're rational so you did,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
um,

08:45.120 --> 08:47.120
I will send you a tripod

08:47.120 --> 08:50.120
in exchange for footage of you praying for my soul.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.800
Please do this. Please.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.800
He links to an article called,

08:54.800 --> 08:56.800
in the text bar at the top,

08:56.800 --> 09:00.800
Egoistic Self-Destruction Thunderf00t Sargon of Akkad.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.800
So he's very angry about certain other reasonable people.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.800
Pfft.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.800
Over the past summer, first Thunderf00t,

09:07.800 --> 09:09.800
Phil Tinas Mason,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
and then Sargon of Akkad, Carl Benjamin,

09:11.800 --> 09:15.800
self-immolated through acts of e-fame driven hubris,

09:15.800 --> 09:18.800
Mason revealed himself as the big government

09:19.480 --> 09:23.480
anti-Brexit globalist who wants your tax dollars to pay for his hobby,

09:23.480 --> 09:26.480
while Benjamin repeatedly invaded alt-right spaces

09:26.480 --> 09:30.480
only to dominate the conversation with first-year communist rhetoric.

09:30.480 --> 09:34.480
The best thing about the alt-right is that if you just wait long enough,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.480
they'll fall out with each other,

09:37.480 --> 09:40.480
and then come tell you why they're shit.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.480
You don't even have to criticize them,

09:42.480 --> 09:45.480
they'll do it themselves when they realize that they hate each other.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.480
I have to admit it was rather gratifying.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.160
Last year, the two of them went on a slanderous attack campaign against-

09:51.160 --> 09:53.160
Hold on a sec.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.160
Last year, the two of them went on a slanderous attack campaign against me,

09:59.160 --> 10:01.160
misquoting an alt-right lying.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.160
They had no regard for the morality of their actions,

10:04.160 --> 10:08.160
nor the real politic consequences of attacking a Gamergate ally.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.160
Gamergate is still important in 2016, guys.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.160
Please, please believe me.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.160
Thunderf00t, the establishment skeptic.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.160
He'll obsessively pick apart anything that doesn't matter in your day-to-day life.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.840
Evolution, hoverboards, and solar roadways,

10:21.840 --> 10:25.840
while ignoring existential threats that demand a skeptical eye.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.840
Global warming, yep.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.840
James Watson,

10:29.840 --> 10:31.840
and over-vaccination.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.840
Sargon of Akkad, aka Marxus of Boobus.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.840
I've expressed my disappointment with Gamergate in the past,

10:40.840 --> 10:43.840
how it went from being a stalwart defense in the culture war,

10:43.840 --> 10:46.840
to being about ethics in games journalism,

10:47.520 --> 10:49.520
to being nothing more than another equality movement,

10:49.520 --> 10:53.520
nothing but a bunch of castrated jackals who thought themselves clever.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.520
These are the people who were giving you money, Davis.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.520
You really shouldn't piss off these people.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.520
I like that he complains that it went from a defense in the culture war,

11:04.520 --> 11:07.520
to being about ethics in game journalism.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.520
Like, wasn't it supposed to have always been about ethics?

11:11.520 --> 11:15.520
Aren't you kind of showing your hand here that it was just an alt-right dog whistle the whole time?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.200
Oops.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.200
The people who matter know who and what Phil and Carl actually are,

11:21.200 --> 11:24.200
so there's no need for me to waste any more time on them,

11:24.200 --> 11:26.200
beyond this short blog post.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.200
Yeah, yeah, of course.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.200
I'm not gonna waste my time on them, but let me continue briefly!

11:31.200 --> 11:34.200
I poured my heart and soul into that movie.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.200
You know what, here's the thing, is,

11:36.200 --> 11:38.200
if I had ever watched any of her fucking videos,

11:38.200 --> 11:41.200
I could have come up with a far tighter argument.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.200
If things had turned out differently, it really could have had an impact.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.880
If the film had been good and contained facts, it would have made a huge difference.

11:47.880 --> 11:52.880
Don't get me wrong, Immersed in Subversion is something I'm genuinely proud of.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.880
Well, that's your first mistake!

11:55.880 --> 11:58.880
It's not just a good film in spite of the circumstances,

11:58.880 --> 12:00.880
it's a bloody good film, period.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.880
The problem with it isn't the film itself, it's the fact that it's on YouTube.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.880
As Marshall McLuhan said, the medium is the message.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.880
And no matter how good the film is, it's nothing but a YouTube movie,

12:11.880 --> 12:13.880
as far as most people are concerned.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.560
The whole point of filming it was to get it onto Netflix!

12:16.560 --> 12:20.560
Without that appearance of endorsement by the assumed experts at Netflix,

12:20.560 --> 12:24.560
it's about as useful as a sports car at the bottom of the ocean.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.560
What?

12:26.560 --> 12:29.560
Mate, I appreciate the reference, I'm a McLuhanist myself,

12:29.560 --> 12:32.560
there's a copy of The Mechanical Bride in that box of books over there somewhere.

12:32.560 --> 12:37.560
But, let's be honest here, your film isn't bad because it's not on Netflix.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.560
It's bad because it's fucking terrible!

12:40.560 --> 12:45.560
Everything's weirdly reframed because you accidentally had Jordan Owen in most of the shots,

12:45.560 --> 12:48.560
and then you had a massive falling out with him, so you had to edit him out.

12:48.560 --> 12:55.560
Like, it's all complete weird decisions that make your point harder to get across.

12:55.560 --> 13:00.560
Like, it's exactly the sort of thing you would expect from the man who made the Alt-Right Dogs trailer.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.560
If you think the people who run Netflix aren't good at their jobs,

13:03.560 --> 13:06.560
why do you want it on Netflix? Why would you want to associate with them?

13:06.560 --> 13:10.560
I would just declare that Netflix were running from me because they were afraid of the truth.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.560
You know, like PayPal apparently are, because you don't know what their rules are.

13:14.560 --> 13:19.560
And with that in mind, let's finish this piece by considering the crucial flaw which brought these men low,

13:19.560 --> 13:21.560
so that we ourselves do not repeat it.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.560
Their sin was ego.

13:23.560 --> 13:28.560
In the analysis I linked above, they delineate the three main strategies that are used against us.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.560
Containment, dilution, and poisoning.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
And ego.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.560
Those aren't...

13:34.560 --> 13:38.560
That's not three things, Davis.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.560
Because this is the internet and half of you are autistic,

13:41.560 --> 13:45.560
did you get that statistic from the place you get the rest of your facts?

13:45.560 --> 13:48.560
I'm going to lay out where I stand and why these are issues.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.560
Global warming, even if it is actually occurring, the solutions being offered won't do anything to combat it.

13:53.560 --> 13:57.560
They're nothing more than Trojan horses for globalist control.

13:58.560 --> 14:04.560
If you've recently come to a conclusion that I reached years ago,

14:04.560 --> 14:07.560
maybe you ought to be listening to the crazy things I'm saying today.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.560
Just saying.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.560
Well, guess what, Davis?

14:10.560 --> 14:14.560
I thought Sargon of Akkad was a bit weird when you were friends with him years ago.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.560
So maybe you should be listening to what I'm saying today.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.560
And I say maybe you should reconsider...

14:20.560 --> 14:25.560
that global warming is a secret plot to take over the world.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.560
Maybe.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
I've got to stop for now.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.560
I'm absolutely busting for a piss.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.560
But until next time,

14:31.560 --> 14:35.560
your documentary doesn't contain facts until it's on Netflix.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.560
Milady.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.560
These are absolutely covered in dust.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
There's no credits in this video.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.560
I'm saving them for a thing that I'm doing later this month.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.560
Just trust me, alright?

14:52.560 --> 14:53.560
It's going to be great.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.560
That ushanka actually looks kind of crap.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.560
I know where you could get some better ushankas,

14:57.560 --> 15:00.560
but you probably wouldn't think much of that place.
