0	7480	Hello, friends and people who come to my channel just to dislike the videos and then run away.
7480	12680	I've just been sent a new video about the Alt-Right Dogs trailer by Karl Yushchenko,
12680	16680	and people keep asking me to watch it or to react to it, so I figured I would set up a
16680	21280	camera because apparently how I feel about this trailer is going to be important.
21280	26160	I don't know why, but let's find out, shall we?
26160	32040	I'm using my laptop because, for unknown reasons, my iMac hasn't been working particularly well lately.
32040	34040	So, uh, yeah. Anyway.
40720	45440	This is the opening of, uh, Reservoir Dogs, isn't it? Yeah.
45440	50000	Oh, Alt-Right Dogs. I get it.
50000	52840	Wait, why would the Alt-Right want to reference fucking Tarantino?
52840	56040	He does not have views that are agreeable to you.
59680	62680	I have nothing against white nationalism.
62680	66480	Oh no, Colonel Hans Lander disliked my videos.
66480	72000	Hans Lander's such a moral, upstanding character whose opinion is worthy of respect.
76120	79480	Is that... is that Matt Forney?
79480	81480	Man, that guy's out of shape.
82840	85720	He looks really upset. Is he being filmed surreptitiously?
85720	88720	Is this made by someone who's not a fan of these people?
91480	97920	Ah, the original film had, like, cool slow-motion close-ups, and these are just stills from a video.
97920	100840	Is Johan the character or the actor playing him?
100840	102840	What? Who?
105280	110400	You know, there were more Reservoir Dogs, so this was a more interesting thing to watch.
110400	114080	Davis? What? Why does he get a real picture?
114080	116080	What? What?
116080	118080	But there was four of them, right? Wasn't there...
118080	120080	Davis is...
120080	122080	Oh, fuck!
122080	126480	There's five of them, but no one else was around to hold the camera.
126480	128480	It's just...
130880	132880	Oh, shit.
134680	138280	Okay, so Davis isn't in this shot, which means that he's the cameraman for this bit.
138360	140360	So why is there a black border on the left?
140360	142360	What? What?
142360	145960	Davis, hold the camera steady! You're supposed to be a real director! No!
146960	148360	Goddammit!
148360	154760	Why couldn't the All Right Dogs find a tripod or a friend to fucking hold the camera for them?
155960	158960	God! Is there not even in the center of the frame?
163960	165960	What?
168960	170960	Oh, God!
172960	174960	Look, Davis...
181960	184960	Get in touch with me, Davis, and I will send you this tripod.
184960	189960	It's not very good, but it means that all five of you will be in the frame.
190960	192960	This is fucking so...
193960	195960	I'm gonna watch it again.
195960	197960	So what is this a trailer for?
198640	200640	Are they making...
200640	202640	Are they making a Reservoir Dogs?
202640	204640	Did they just want to broadcast how badass they are to the world?
204640	206640	Because it totally worked.
206640	208640	I can't believe that there are five All Right Dogs,
208640	212640	and, like, they didn't have any friends who would hold the camera for them.
213640	217640	You know, the actual Reservoir Dogs trailer had footage of them, like, doing stuff.
217640	221640	They weren't just, like, taking the crosswalk outside McDonald's.
221640	225640	They were, like, doing stuff from the film to try and sell you on it.
226320	227320	This is just...
227320	229320	This is just piss.
229320	231320	Oh, here it comes. Yeah.
233320	235320	I have a feel that if they had slightly more budget,
235320	237320	at that point, they would cut Matt Forney
237320	240320	shot and bleeding to death in the back of Davis' car
240320	243320	that he bought with the Sarkeesian effect money.
243320	246320	Why is the footage misaligned like that?
246320	248320	You would have to do that on purpose.
249320	251320	Like, what?
252000	258000	Davis Arini, the cameraman for this footage,
258000	260000	thinks he's a filmmaker.
260000	263000	He's very sure he's a real filmmaker.
263000	266000	Slow motion shaky cam is just the most...
266000	269000	It's just the most rational thing, you know?
269000	273000	I mean, all in all, it's not the worst trailer Davis has been involved with,
273000	276000	but it's pretty up there.
276000	278000	By the way, who is Carl Eushanka?
278000	280000	I want to see what Eushanka US is.
280680	282680	I'm actually kind of interested now.
284680	286680	I just want to go to eushanka.us.
286680	287680	Please, just take me to...
287680	289680	I don't want to set up parental controls.
289680	292680	Alright, blog.eushanka.us is...
292680	294680	Hold on a sec.
294680	297680	This is the guy who makes the eushankas that Davis has been selling
297680	299680	on his fucking blog for years!
300680	301680	Holy shit!
301680	302680	What?
302680	304680	The collusion is real!
305680	307680	Advertise my hats on your blog, Davis,
308360	310360	and I'll give you a part in Alt-Right Dogs, the trailer.
311360	313360	I'm willing to bet that if I checked,
313360	316360	one of the other guys would be the guy behind the testosterone cream
316360	318360	and the other shit that he advertises on his blog.
318360	320360	Let's see what he's selling right now.
320360	322360	Support my Patreon.
322360	324360	Buy my Fallout fanfiction.
324360	326360	Please watch Lust in the Time of Heartache.
326360	331360	My full-length documentary on game-negate social-justice-Marxist narcissism
331360	333360	and Anita Sarkeesian.
333360	336360	He's a professional on one of those topics.
337040	339040	And, of course, Karl Eushanka's glorious hat.
339040	341040	It's stylish. It's warm.
341040	343040	It drives liberals nuts.
343040	346040	Well, I guess I am nuts, but not because of your hat.
346040	349040	I think the hat is really funny, and you should wear it constantly.
349040	352040	Confessions of an Online Hustler by Matt Forney.
353040	358040	He's just using his blog to sell, like, the shit of his four other friends.
358040	360040	BachelorPad Economics by Aaron!
361040	363040	Who'd have thought?
363720	367720	He's also trying to sell Roosh V's latest book,
367720	372720	but Roosh, I guess, couldn't make the time to appear in his really badass film trailer.
372720	377720	Is PayPal joining Google and Twitter in the censorship war?
382720	384720	I'm gonna read this.
384720	390720	Okay, Davis has had minor trouble with how PayPal works,
391400	393400	which is understandable. That happens to literally everyone.
393400	395400	It's happened to me.
395400	400400	But he appears to think that it means they've taken a side in an internet censorship war?
402400	404400	I mean, okay.
404400	408400	Also, he feels the need to specifically point out that the person he was talking to on the phone was a girl.
408400	410400	As if, like, you needed to know that.
410400	412400	I wonder why.
412400	414400	The girl, and you know what they're like,
414400	418400	claimed that their investigations aren't motivated by the same sort of political bias
419080	421080	that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are exhibiting.
421080	423080	What, did you call her on the phone and say,
423080	426080	Are you like Twitter? Are you out to get me?
426080	430080	Matt Forney, whose book is literally right next to this fucking post,
430080	435080	suspects, and I agree, that this might be the first step in kicking me off their platform.
435080	438080	Oh wow, he actually does think PayPal is out to get him.
438080	442080	The fact that all these companies are resorting to such tactics is good news for our side.
442080	446080	Yeah, it's good that you're getting kicked off of all these platforms, apparently.
446760	450760	It means they're running scared, and it means that they consider me dangerous.
450760	452760	I've got some weird PayPal issues as well,
452760	456760	and a lot of people do because PayPal is actually not very good.
456760	458760	That doesn't mean PayPal is scared of you,
458760	460760	it just means it's a bit crap.
460760	465760	There's nothing that makes me happier than being hated by the unrighteous.
466760	468760	Nobody hates you, Davis.
468760	470760	I think you're amazing.
470760	474760	Only time will tell what PayPal's actually up to.
475440	477440	Cue the X-Files theme.
477440	479440	Honestly, I'm not too worried about it.
479440	481440	Unlike some people I could mention,
481440	483440	I have avenues available to-
483440	488440	I have avenues available to me outside of YouTube Benjamins and the public dole.
488440	493440	And by this time next year, I hope to be a contributor to the various alt-right voices whom I enjoy.
493440	496440	Assuming that they're still able to receive PayPal, of course.
496440	499440	I still haven't figured out how to Bitcoin!
499440	501440	Hahahaha!
502120	506120	Of course, you're more than free to include your questions, prayer requests,
506120	508120	or ideas for videos when you donate.
508120	510120	Prayer requests?
510120	512120	Wait, is he-
512120	514120	Oh, was that a joke?
514120	516120	Or can I get Davis to pray for me?
516120	519120	Because I need that, I need that right now.
519120	521120	Davis, if you manage to watch this far,
521120	523120	and I know you're rational so you did,
523120	525120	um,
525120	527120	I will send you a tripod
527120	530120	in exchange for footage of you praying for my soul.
530800	532800	Please do this. Please.
532800	534800	He links to an article called,
534800	536800	in the text bar at the top,
536800	540800	Egoistic Self-Destruction Thunderf00t Sargon of Akkad.
540800	544800	So he's very angry about certain other reasonable people.
544800	545800	Pfft.
545800	547800	Over the past summer, first Thunderf00t,
547800	549800	Phil Tinas Mason,
549800	551800	and then Sargon of Akkad, Carl Benjamin,
551800	555800	self-immolated through acts of e-fame driven hubris,
555800	558800	Mason revealed himself as the big government
559480	563480	anti-Brexit globalist who wants your tax dollars to pay for his hobby,
563480	566480	while Benjamin repeatedly invaded alt-right spaces
566480	570480	only to dominate the conversation with first-year communist rhetoric.
570480	574480	The best thing about the alt-right is that if you just wait long enough,
574480	577480	they'll fall out with each other,
577480	580480	and then come tell you why they're shit.
580480	582480	You don't even have to criticize them,
582480	585480	they'll do it themselves when they realize that they hate each other.
585480	588480	I have to admit it was rather gratifying.
589160	591160	Last year, the two of them went on a slanderous attack campaign against-
591160	593160	Hold on a sec.
595160	599160	Last year, the two of them went on a slanderous attack campaign against me,
599160	601160	misquoting an alt-right lying.
601160	604160	They had no regard for the morality of their actions,
604160	608160	nor the real politic consequences of attacking a Gamergate ally.
608160	610160	Gamergate is still important in 2016, guys.
610160	612160	Please, please believe me.
612160	614160	Thunderf00t, the establishment skeptic.
614160	618160	He'll obsessively pick apart anything that doesn't matter in your day-to-day life.
618840	621840	Evolution, hoverboards, and solar roadways,
621840	625840	while ignoring existential threats that demand a skeptical eye.
625840	627840	Global warming, yep.
627840	629840	James Watson,
629840	631840	and over-vaccination.
632840	636840	Sargon of Akkad, aka Marxus of Boobus.
637840	640840	I've expressed my disappointment with Gamergate in the past,
640840	643840	how it went from being a stalwart defense in the culture war,
643840	646840	to being about ethics in games journalism,
647520	649520	to being nothing more than another equality movement,
649520	653520	nothing but a bunch of castrated jackals who thought themselves clever.
653520	656520	These are the people who were giving you money, Davis.
656520	659520	You really shouldn't piss off these people.
659520	664520	I like that he complains that it went from a defense in the culture war,
664520	667520	to being about ethics in game journalism.
667520	671520	Like, wasn't it supposed to have always been about ethics?
671520	675520	Aren't you kind of showing your hand here that it was just an alt-right dog whistle the whole time?
676200	677200	Oops.
677200	681200	The people who matter know who and what Phil and Carl actually are,
681200	684200	so there's no need for me to waste any more time on them,
684200	686200	beyond this short blog post.
686200	688200	Yeah, yeah, of course.
688200	691200	I'm not gonna waste my time on them, but let me continue briefly!
691200	694200	I poured my heart and soul into that movie.
694200	696200	You know what, here's the thing, is,
696200	698200	if I had ever watched any of her fucking videos,
698200	701200	I could have come up with a far tighter argument.
701200	704200	If things had turned out differently, it really could have had an impact.
704880	707880	If the film had been good and contained facts, it would have made a huge difference.
707880	712880	Don't get me wrong, Immersed in Subversion is something I'm genuinely proud of.
713880	715880	Well, that's your first mistake!
715880	718880	It's not just a good film in spite of the circumstances,
718880	720880	it's a bloody good film, period.
720880	724880	The problem with it isn't the film itself, it's the fact that it's on YouTube.
724880	727880	As Marshall McLuhan said, the medium is the message.
727880	731880	And no matter how good the film is, it's nothing but a YouTube movie,
731880	733880	as far as most people are concerned.
734560	736560	The whole point of filming it was to get it onto Netflix!
736560	740560	Without that appearance of endorsement by the assumed experts at Netflix,
740560	744560	it's about as useful as a sports car at the bottom of the ocean.
745560	746560	What?
746560	749560	Mate, I appreciate the reference, I'm a McLuhanist myself,
749560	752560	there's a copy of The Mechanical Bride in that box of books over there somewhere.
752560	757560	But, let's be honest here, your film isn't bad because it's not on Netflix.
757560	760560	It's bad because it's fucking terrible!
760560	765560	Everything's weirdly reframed because you accidentally had Jordan Owen in most of the shots,
765560	768560	and then you had a massive falling out with him, so you had to edit him out.
768560	775560	Like, it's all complete weird decisions that make your point harder to get across.
775560	780560	Like, it's exactly the sort of thing you would expect from the man who made the Alt-Right Dogs trailer.
780560	783560	If you think the people who run Netflix aren't good at their jobs,
783560	786560	why do you want it on Netflix? Why would you want to associate with them?
786560	790560	I would just declare that Netflix were running from me because they were afraid of the truth.
790560	794560	You know, like PayPal apparently are, because you don't know what their rules are.
794560	799560	And with that in mind, let's finish this piece by considering the crucial flaw which brought these men low,
799560	801560	so that we ourselves do not repeat it.
801560	803560	Their sin was ego.
803560	808560	In the analysis I linked above, they delineate the three main strategies that are used against us.
808560	811560	Containment, dilution, and poisoning.
811560	812560	And ego.
812560	814560	Those aren't...
814560	818560	That's not three things, Davis.
818560	821560	Because this is the internet and half of you are autistic,
821560	825560	did you get that statistic from the place you get the rest of your facts?
825560	828560	I'm going to lay out where I stand and why these are issues.
828560	833560	Global warming, even if it is actually occurring, the solutions being offered won't do anything to combat it.
833560	837560	They're nothing more than Trojan horses for globalist control.
838560	844560	If you've recently come to a conclusion that I reached years ago,
844560	847560	maybe you ought to be listening to the crazy things I'm saying today.
847560	849560	Just saying.
849560	850560	Well, guess what, Davis?
850560	854560	I thought Sargon of Akkad was a bit weird when you were friends with him years ago.
854560	857560	So maybe you should be listening to what I'm saying today.
857560	860560	And I say maybe you should reconsider...
860560	865560	that global warming is a secret plot to take over the world.
865560	866560	Maybe.
866560	867560	I've got to stop for now.
867560	869560	I'm absolutely busting for a piss.
869560	871560	But until next time,
871560	875560	your documentary doesn't contain facts until it's on Netflix.
879560	880560	Milady.
883560	885560	These are absolutely covered in dust.
887560	888560	There's no credits in this video.
888560	891560	I'm saving them for a thing that I'm doing later this month.
891560	892560	Just trust me, alright?
892560	893560	It's going to be great.
893560	895560	That ushanka actually looks kind of crap.
895560	897560	I know where you could get some better ushankas,
897560	900560	but you probably wouldn't think much of that place.
