1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
I wonder if I can get Max to do a version of this intro with sleigh bells. Hold on.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,500
Ah, he's busy. It's Christmas. Goddamnit.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,520
Hello, friends.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,060
Christmas is upon us once more, as you can tell.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,320
And you know what that means? Spending time with the people you love.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,560
By which I mean...

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,540
there's a Steam sale on.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,560
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,980
So to celebrate the great games of 2016,

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,420
give a couple of recommendations for stuff you might as well get while it's on sale,

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,260
and figure out what my personal game of the year is,

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,800
I thought I'd give my top 11 games of 2016.

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,080
Why 11?

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,200
Because I-

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,460
Oh, by the way, some games will be games that didn't necessarily come out in 2016,

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,000
but which I happened to play for the first time this year.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,920
Some games aren't even out yet, thanks to the magic of Steam Early Access.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,500
I didn't plan this list out very well.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,600
Oops.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Number 11, No Man's Sky.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
That's right. This year I did the most dangerous thing you can do on the internet.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,340
I like to game more than the people who make angry rants about them for attention.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,420
I don't watch trailers, or read press releases, or pay attention to the endless speculation about future games

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,940
that might be so good they eradicate the inherent ennui of being mortal.

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,460
So my hopes were never raised.

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,660
I didn't need No Man's Sky to be anything, so my expectations couldn't be betrayed.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:21,380
I let the game be what it was, and what it was was big and empty and beautiful and lonely and impersonal.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,400
It was like reading The Road, only marginally less depressing and far better written.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,080
Look, sorry, Cormac, it's really not your best. The movie was better.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I really liked it, and you can't stop me.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,440
They're updating it to slowly add stuff I didn't think it needed all that much,

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,080
and make it more like the game everyone else wanted it to be.

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,200
So when it finishes up doing all that in the minimum two years required to make it into that game,

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm sure everyone else will finally check it out for five minutes and go,

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,300
Eh, I guess it's pretty good, and then turn it off and go back to playing Star Citizen,

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,300
which I'm sure will be out by then.

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,940
But the stripped-down experience of a loose, almost aimless journey through the vast yet mundane reaches of space

38
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,020
got me in a really big way.

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,340
I can't say I like the changes that are being made,

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,940
and I especially can't say I like the idea that the team were actually going for the game they're making it into,

41
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,580
because that means they completely fucked up.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,040
But it would be wrong of me to deny the fun I had, idly toiling in the universe of No Man's Sky.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Number 10, Brigador.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
Brigador, formerly known as Matador according to Wikipedia,

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
went into early access in 2015, and I played it a tiny bit back then,

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,200
but when it came out fully this year, I went back to it and had a great time.

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,680
It's an isometric game in which you control a mech, tank, or flying car

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
through a highly destructible world and take out enemy vehicles and buildings.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,620
There's a great mix of stealth, reflexive action, and tactics going on all at once in a great way,

50
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,140
and I just love the aesthetic.

51
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,020
It reminds me of a high-res version of early 90s PC games like Fallout,

52
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,300
complete with more advanced lighting effects.

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,460
The music is also absolutely fantastic.

54
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,220
There are some genuine bangers by Makeup and Vanity Set,

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,980
but every time I try to listen to them on their own, I have to stop and just go play the game.

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,660
It's relentlessly hard at times, and some of the vehicles seem ridiculously difficult on purpose,

57
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,400
but it's a lot of fun and quick enough that dying on an attempt doesn't feel like you wasted a lot of time.

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,060
I really love the sense of scope the game brings to the action.

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,160
You're usually going after specific targets, like an orbital relay or a few specific enemy machines,

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,000
but you can basically walk through buildings and almost everything else,

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,840
including people, and generally wreak a lot of havoc.

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,920
There's this great sense of purpose when buildings are going off all around you

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,960
and chain reaction explosions from gunfire and civilians are running away in their little yellow coats,

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,800
tiny victims of a greater battle that are completely ignored as you and the occupation duke it out for their ultimate fate.

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,240
These little touches add a lot of feeling to play,

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,260
and it makes Brigadier good enough that I put it in my top 11 list,

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,820
even though I played it technically last year.

68
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm really bad at this!

69
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,420
Number nine, Hitman.

70
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,760
The Hitman games are mostly shite.

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
Each successive game feels like an unfinished beta for the next one.

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,660
The technology is never quite good enough to encapsulate the vision of a world

73
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,500
where you hit mans for money and have the freedom to do it lots of ways.

74
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,380
Hitman 1 is barely playable garbage fire.

75
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,420
Hitman 2 is technically a functional piece of software,

76
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,700
but it's critically un-fun to play the intended way and so on,

77
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,620
culminating in Blood Money, an actually pretty decent game with some fun stuff,

78
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,860
but which really doesn't hold up in retrospect.

79
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,300
And then there's its sequel, Hitman Subtitle—I mean, Hitman Absolution,

80
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,540
a very average Hitman game that crashed a third of the way through and deleted all my saves,

81
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,980
and I had no interest in replaying any of the levels to get back to where I was,

82
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,620
which, for a Hitman game, is a really bad sign.

83
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,500
My expectations for this game were incredibly low.

84
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,300
But actually playing it, it's really fun and cool.

85
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,500
It's less a case of the technology finally catching up with the vision

86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,140
and more the vision itself changing and advancing,

87
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,140
as evidenced by the episodic setup and dramatically increased scope of the levels

88
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,740
and the options available to you.

89
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,180
The opportunity system is annoying because it spells out solutions to you,

90
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,740
and the AI sometimes seems all too prepared to feed the solution to you no matter what.

91
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,580
Hey, this Hitman guy looks like he could disguise himself

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,460
as this guy and go wherever he wanted in the building.

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh, fuck you. You think it's so easy to be a fucking Hitman, you piece of shit?

94
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,140
Oh, look, a masseuse in a relatively unguarded area is gonna have a private massage

95
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,380
with the guy we have to ki—

96
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,500
Oh, just...

97
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,880
What?

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,440
It just—it even has a thing to tell you, like, it gives instructions,

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
gives you a map to where he is.

100
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,160
Oh, you've got an interview with the guy I've gotta kill, do you?

101
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,240
That's a nice thing to just keep saying out loud on repeat until I hear it.

102
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,440
If you think it's a fucking smart way, you do the assassination.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
Here, here's my gun.

104
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,480
Here's my proximity device.

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,320
You do the fucking assassination if you think it's a fucking smart fucking piece of shit.

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,680
But you can turn that system off,

107
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,000
and overall, the game is good enough at presenting you with an intuitive but challenging situation

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,720
and letting you solve it yourself without much trial or error.

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
What's going on?

110
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,800
— What? — Police! Police!

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,280
It's the game Hitman was always supposed to have been,

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,200
and it's nice. It finally validates all the really bad ones I played through.

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,760
— Nothing there. — Who would've thought it?

114
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,840
Number eight, Superhot.

115
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
For those of you who haven't heard of Superhot—

116
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,840
Sorry, Superhot.

117
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,080
It's a game about a game where you play someone trying to pirate the game Superhot

118
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,680
and occasionally play betas,

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,720
which involve simple but stylish first-person action puzzles where time only moves when you move.

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,920
It's ridiculously pretty, and it manages to make a frenetic shooter

121
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,120
that you can slow down at any time still feel challenging.

122
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,320
Superhot is very short, but I've replayed it about eight times

123
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,800
because I like time-warping murder so much.

124
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,560
I can't wait to eventually somehow own all the exceedingly expensive equipment

125
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,960
required to play the Oculus Touch VR version,

126
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
which looks amazing, frankly,

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,960
and like the first game that might actually justify getting a VR setup like that.

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,600
Unfortunately, Santa Claus isn't real.

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm sorry, kids.

130
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,560
It's your parents.

131
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,800
Number seven, Darkest Dungeon.

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,040
Double D is so good, I made an entire video about the feelings it gave me as I played it.

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,760
It's a very good RPG with people and home-based managing sections evocative of XCOM,

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,680
which is great, but what makes it even more awesome

135
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,400
is the feeling that the world's infectious evil is slowly turning you into a monster, too.

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,720
It's a type of game I will, in all likelihood, rip off at some point in the future in my own games.

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,520
It encourages a much more dehumanizing approach than XCOM,

138
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,240
where you recognize that these people are frail and expendable

139
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,480
and slowly become less and less attached to the dozens of people that move through your ranks.

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,840
In XCOM, you eventually start wanting to painstakingly save and reload

141
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,720
to preserve the high-level trooper you named after one of your friends

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,520
who you've been on so many adventures with at that point.

143
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,080
In Darkest Dungeon, you've named eight people after that friend,

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,160
and the latest one is definitely doomed, too, and already has a drinking problem.

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,920
Number six, Factorio.

146
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,720
I bought this game around midnight one day and played it for a bit.

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,680
It seemed pretty good.

148
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I looked out my window, and it was getting light.

149
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,280
Then I played it a bit longer and looked out my window again, and it was dark.

150
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,840
I assumed I'd just been wrong about it getting light,

151
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,120
like my eyes had been deceiving me because I'd been looking at a screen for so long.

152
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,240
Then I checked the time on my phone, and it was 7 p.m. the next day.

153
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I currently have 19 hours of playtime logged on Factorio,

154
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,960
and that was one session.

155
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,920
I didn't take any breaks.

156
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,880
I haven't even gone into the game yet to record the footage.

157
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm filming this bit first.

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,640
Factorio is a game about automation.

159
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,880
You mine some materials to build a mining machine,

160
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,120
and then mine materials to fuel the mining machine,

161
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,520
and then use the materials the machine mines to build a machine

162
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,240
that mines the other stuff and feeds it into the other machines on its own,

163
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,880
and then 15 hours later, you've been using the oil you've been refining,

164
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,120
using the electricity that you gain from building other stuff

165
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
to start researching fuel and building a spaceship,

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,520
and you've built a giant Rube Goldberg machine

167
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,640
that, if you're smart, doesn't require any interaction by you.

168
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,600
It scratches an itch that only games can scratch,

169
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,280
and it does it incredibly well.

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,720
A mod for Minecraft back in the day added mining machines a bit like this,

171
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,920
and suddenly made Minecraft into a game that you could actually call fun and a game,

172
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,520
and you could build and manage pipes for all the masses of materials you were digging up.

173
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,800
I believe the developers worked on one such mod, uh, I think.

174
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,200
I love Factorio, and if I stop making videos,

175
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,640
it's probably because I died in my chair playing it and forgot to eat.

176
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,400
The only reason I haven't rated it higher

177
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,520
is because it's not exactly got an emotionally fulfilling story,

178
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,160
and it only really appeals to the childlike urge to build systems and watch them go.

179
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
The game could be called repetitive,

180
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,760
but I don't think it's a kind of repetition I could ever personally get bored with.

181
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,600
I can't imagine what the game will be like when it's actually finished and out of early access,

182
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
because I already think it's just—

183
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,080
it's—it's so good at what it does right now.

184
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
Maybe whenever there's eventually an official release,

185
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll dive back in and then never come out.

186
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Ah, it's gonna be so good, guys.

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,280
I'm gonna die playing a video game!

188
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,520
Number five, Lady Killer in a Bind.

189
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,760
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,560
Lady Killer in a Bind is a visual novel

191
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,080
which frequently depicts sections wherein the characters are having sex.

192
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,320
But I would be hard-pressed to actually call it pornography.

193
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,560
It's deeply concerned with the ideas and voices and pretensions of its characters.

194
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,640
So many lines are quotable and funny,

195
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,880
or feel like they have an actual point to make about how humans relate to one another.

196
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,040
It's clear that a lot of time went into polishing the precise feel every scene has.

197
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,240
Every word and choice and piece of music fits perfectly,

198
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,560
and the music even slides into a nice menu version when you go to save.

199
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,800
The story can develop in quite a few different directions

200
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,480
based on the myriad choices you can make about where to spend your time on the cruise ship

201
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,120
trying to win an absurd popularity contest.

202
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,600
Christine Love, the creator who also made Analog A Hate Story and Hate Plus,

203
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,720
didn't just write some words and put some art next to them that occasionally depict sex.

204
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,600
There's an appreciable precision to it.

205
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,920
Love is very concerned with video game fashion,

206
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,880
and it shows.

207
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
Every character is style-in,

208
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,240
and also changes into equally style-in new clothes every day.

209
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,040
You know, like a person would actually do.

210
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,800
I would be lying if I said I didn't have at least two outfits I wear in public

211
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,680
that I stole directly from the main character's wardrobe.

212
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,320
Incidentally, a recent patch added a work-safe mode

213
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,680
that adds delightfully garish Christmas sweaters to the sex scenes.

214
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,400
This is a coincidence?

215
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,880
It's—it's—it's—it's really good,

216
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,720
and I'd recommend it if you're into the idea of playing the most long-form

217
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,160
and emotionally engaging pieces of what could technically be called erotica ever made.

218
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,720
I've heard rumblings that it's even coming out on Steam,

219
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,440
and Steam only slightly lets porn onto its platform,

220
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,600
so you know it has to be some of the good stuff, right?

221
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Number four, video ball.

222
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,280
Video ball is the new sport.

223
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,800
It's asteroids meets pong meets table tennis meets another world.

224
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,480
Heck, it's such a specific mishmash that that comparison doesn't really work

225
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,720
because it feels so unique on its own.

226
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,240
Everything is delineated easily,

227
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,520
so you understand what's happening

228
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,320
without needing to have played it for dozens of hours yourself.

229
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm looking at you, all MOBAs.

230
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,600
I love this game, but there's a downside to placing it so high on my list.

231
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,280
I can't really recommend video ball because not many people play it.

232
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,280
It's really hard to find a game, and the netcode isn't too great,

233
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
and since it didn't sell well,

234
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,920
a lot of the patches to improve this stuff are probably never gonna materialize,

235
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,280
and that's a damn shame.

236
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,440
It's a travesty that there aren't a hundred people

237
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,760
constantly playing it at all times to join in with.

238
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,920
This was basically the only game I'd allowed myself to get hyped about for years.

239
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,640
I even drove to Birmingham to see it before its release.

240
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,320
It's as good as I'd hoped it to be,

241
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,360
but I'm still disappointed because I rarely get to play it.

242
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,320
Instead, I'll recommend whatever Tim Rogers makes next.

243
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,040
I've decided that he deserves your money.

244
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,640
But if you feel like giving it a shot,

245
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,000
join the official Discord and arrange games through there with other players.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,240
I quite like the community aspect in that regard,

247
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,920
but I don't like how it means everyone's better than me.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
It's not an e-sport.

249
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,960
It's an A-sport.

250
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,400
Because it's so good.

251
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,800
I-I-I-I told that joke to Tim Rogers, the creator,

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,880
when he was at a convention showing the game off,

253
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,760
and he tried to hide it,

254
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,480
but he very obviously winced a little bit.

255
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,720
Number three, Skyrim remastered.

256
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,680
Number three, Lisa.

257
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Lisa was a late 2014 release,

258
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,160
but I only got around to it in early February this year

259
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,400
because I'm a failed human.

260
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,800
Luckily, failure's what Lisa's all about.

261
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,040
You play a drug addict called Brad in a world

262
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,600
where all the women spontaneously disappeared one day,

263
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
so, of course, society completely collapsed

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,960
and is now a wasteland where dirty magazines are currency.

265
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,840
Brad attempts to secretly raise a baby girl he finds one day,

266
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,320
but eventually everyone finds out and goes after her,

267
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,560
and Brad undergoes a series of bad times

268
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,080
and hallucinatory relivings of childhood trauma in order to save her.

269
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,560
The game has a very cool but uncanny soundtrack

270
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,960
that adds to a terrific sense of unease.

271
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,320
Not just the feeling that the world sucks and things might not end well,

272
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,120
but that your actions are directly making everything worse.

273
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,680
At numerous points, Brad is presented with critical choices

274
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,320
like which party members to subject to Russian roulette

275
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,360
or whether or not to lose everything he has or one of his arms,

276
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,280
and the consequences are real.

277
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,760
Over the course of the game, you can unexpectedly lose friends,

278
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,960
not even for story reasons.

279
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,360
They can just get ganked by a dangerous world,

280
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,640
and Brad can even end up losing both of his arms.

281
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,760
The tone can be puzzling and take some time to get accustomed to,

282
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,000
but it's worth it, and I had a really good time feeling bad and sad

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,440
and like I was only hurting the people I loved by trying to be the hero.

284
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,120
I intend to make a video exploring Lisa in more detail at some point in the future,

285
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,560
but basically, it's great.

286
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Number two, Undertale.

287
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,480
Everything about Undertale has already been said, including by me.

288
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,640
I played it late because I tried to avoid hype,

289
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,040
so for me, it gets to be a 2016 game.

290
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,440
It's really good, and you'd better have played it by now.

291
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,960
Don't leave it like I did.

292
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,720
At this point, it's been talked about so much

293
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,000
that I'd rather just recommend it

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,720
and assume you've either heard the reasons before or played it.

295
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,240
Just—just—just do it.

296
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,040
Please.

297
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,800
Undertale only slightly beats out Lisa by having even better music

298
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,400
and, more importantly, more electro swing remixes on YouTube.

299
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,080
I wouldn't rate one higher than the other

300
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,240
if I weren't forcing myself for the purposes of a dumb reductionist game of the year list.

301
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,120
They're very, very different games despite both being RPGs,

302
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,560
and I would recommend both,

303
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,640
but I recommend Lisa more often because far less people seem to have heard of it.

304
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,080
The downside to Undertale's massive popularity and reception by fans

305
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,280
is it's probably immensely damaged Toby Fox's psyche

306
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,040
and led him to believe he can never top it and make him maybe stop making games,

307
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,440
whereas Austin Jorgensen is actively and openly working on his next game, Ninja Tears,

308
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,400
which I can't wait for, so that's pretty nice.

309
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,240
Number one, Bloodborne.

310
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,360
Yes, that game I spent 90 minutes calling amazing over and over

311
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,120
is my favorite game of this year,

312
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,120
and it's my favorite game of this year because I only got a PS4 pretty recently.

313
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,440
It's also the only game I own on the PS4,

314
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,360
and I feel like it was worth the price of entry.

315
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm currently working through the DLC,

316
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,160
dying to this guy in five seconds over and over and over.

317
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,880
Expect a video about the DLC at some point in the future.

318
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,920
Maybe.

319
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,400
I'll have to see if I think I have anything worth saying about it,

320
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,760
and if people are interested.

321
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,200
So there you have it.

322
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
My favorite game of 2016.

323
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,640
A game from 2050.

324
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,140
Fuck!

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,480
Fuck!

326
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,200
This isn't fair!

327
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,920
This isn't right!

328
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,720
I can't! I can't!

329
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,780
It's not!

330
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,040
I can't!

331
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,280
The actual game of the year can't be a game from last year.

332
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,780
That...

333
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
That's really stupid.

334
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,960
But luckily, this whole thing's fucking scripted.

335
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,880
I have an actual game of the year from this year.

336
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
Number one, or I guess...

337
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,200
Bloodborne is kind of, like, one of my favorite things I did this year,

338
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,680
so I guess the number zero is...

339
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,760
Doom!

340
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,880
Oh my goodness!

341
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,560
What a shock this turned out to be.

342
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,600
They made another Doom, and it wasn't just average.

343
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,520
It wasn't just another first-person shooter.

344
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,920
It wasn't just a remake of the original's mechanics,

345
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,800
or those of the underrated but not-Doomy Doom 3.

346
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,680
And it wasn't just nicking mechanics from other modern shooters.

347
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,920
Calling Doom the best first-person shooter

348
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,800
implies it's even in the same category as those, and it's not.

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
If anything, it's the first of something else entirely.

350
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,760
Not the last of the old, but the first of something new.

351
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,400
Fights have a speed, a rhythm, a pace, an ebb and flow of health and ammunition

352
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,440
that utterly destroys the mechanical design of early shooters

353
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,680
and the regenerating health, take cover, and wait a while nonsense of later stuff.

354
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,200
The movement is slick, but just slow enough to feel deliberate,

355
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,520
and the glory kills look and feel great.

356
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,840
They're integrated well into the rest of the health system.

357
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,160
The soundtrack pauses briefly, and it's just...

358
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,880
Oh!

359
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,400
And there are so many different ones for different angles and height differences,

360
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,000
and they never feel anywhere near as bullshit and repetitive as they could have done.

361
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Cough, cough.

362
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Deus Ex takedowns.

363
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,320
There's even a beautiful philosophical approach reflected in the Doom Marine's actions,

364
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,280
where he chooses to wordlessly ignore the information that

365
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,880
Argent Devil Doom Evil Bad Energy can technically be used for good

366
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,360
with only the occasional Nightmare Holocaust.

367
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,880
You must stop.

368
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,640
The Hell Energy is unusable without the filters.

369
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Because it's good to oppose something outright,

370
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,640
even if it can supposedly have positive effects

371
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,240
if you ignore how it's also causing the downfall of civilization.

372
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,400
I hope there's a DLC that's just...

373
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,520
the Doom Marine standing in front of robot Steve Jobs

374
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,640
and just kicking the shit out of the new iPhone just repeatedly.

375
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,240
Entire books have been written about the engine and level design of the first two Dooms,

376
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,000
and entire books will, or at least should, be written about this one.

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,080
A glorious new era of action games is waiting to be brought into existence,

378
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,680
and many of the tools for building them are sitting right here.

379
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,960
The one downside—the ONE downside to New Doom

380
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,080
is Bethesda saw its massive success as proof that it's a good idea

381
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,160
to continue to have shitty business practices that promise to only hurt the games industry

382
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,920
and reduce its chances of making those potential good games I just talked about.

383
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,040
Oh yeah, you voted for it on Twitter, and I didn't forget.

384
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm just lazy and fat and disgusting.

385
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,880
Next time we're going to look into why Bethesda's policies promise to make it

386
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,480
one of the worst game development companies ever,

387
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,840
long into 2017 and doubtless all the rest of the years,

388
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,600
and not for the regular reason of all the bad games that they keep making.

389
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,400
Thanks for watching. I just ate three walnut whips.

390
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,680
How's your Christmas going?

391
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,680
I've got a whole bunch of plans for next year.

392
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,200
I've got a whole bunch of bonus material I found on a hard drive that I thought was broken

393
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,960
but actually was just not plugged in properly.

394
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I want to finish the Dark Souls 2 apologetics video, which is going pretty well,

395
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
but I thought I'd re-record loads of bits of it

396
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,320
because otherwise it's just things I cut out of the Bloodborne video,

397
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,160
and I feel like it needs to be even more cohesive.

398
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,440
I like to pace things properly.

399
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:50,360
Oh, also, a Swedish bodybuilding Nazi tried to copyright claim one of my videos!

400
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,520
So we might have to talk about that at some point, too.

401
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,320
See ya!

402
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,320
So

403
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,280
I realized that I actually have to bring the camera in with me.
