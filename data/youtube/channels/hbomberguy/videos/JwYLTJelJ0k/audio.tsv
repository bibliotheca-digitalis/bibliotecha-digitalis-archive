0	3580	I wonder if I can get Max to do a version of this intro with sleigh bells. Hold on.
4300	6500	Ah, he's busy. It's Christmas. Goddamnit.
6500	7520	Hello, friends.
7520	10060	Christmas is upon us once more, as you can tell.
10500	13320	And you know what that means? Spending time with the people you love.
13320	14560	By which I mean...
15000	16540	there's a Steam sale on.
16540	19560	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
19560	21980	So to celebrate the great games of 2016,
21980	25420	give a couple of recommendations for stuff you might as well get while it's on sale,
25420	28260	and figure out what my personal game of the year is,
28300	31800	I thought I'd give my top 11 games of 2016.
32260	33080	Why 11?
33700	34200	Because I-
34600	38460	Oh, by the way, some games will be games that didn't necessarily come out in 2016,
38460	41000	but which I happened to play for the first time this year.
41000	44920	Some games aren't even out yet, thanks to the magic of Steam Early Access.
45860	47500	I didn't plan this list out very well.
48100	48600	Oops.
48600	50600	Number 11, No Man's Sky.
50600	54600	That's right. This year I did the most dangerous thing you can do on the internet.
54640	58340	I like to game more than the people who make angry rants about them for attention.
58960	64420	I don't watch trailers, or read press releases, or pay attention to the endless speculation about future games
64420	67940	that might be so good they eradicate the inherent ennui of being mortal.
68140	69460	So my hopes were never raised.
69460	74660	I didn't need No Man's Sky to be anything, so my expectations couldn't be betrayed.
74900	81380	I let the game be what it was, and what it was was big and empty and beautiful and lonely and impersonal.
81600	86400	It was like reading The Road, only marginally less depressing and far better written.
86400	89080	Look, sorry, Cormac, it's really not your best. The movie was better.
89080	94080	I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I really liked it, and you can't stop me.
94080	97440	They're updating it to slowly add stuff I didn't think it needed all that much,
97440	100080	and make it more like the game everyone else wanted it to be.
100080	105200	So when it finishes up doing all that in the minimum two years required to make it into that game,
105200	109120	I'm sure everyone else will finally check it out for five minutes and go,
109260	114300	Eh, I guess it's pretty good, and then turn it off and go back to playing Star Citizen,
114300	116300	which I'm sure will be out by then.
116460	122940	But the stripped-down experience of a loose, almost aimless journey through the vast yet mundane reaches of space
122940	125020	got me in a really big way.
125020	127340	I can't say I like the changes that are being made,
127340	132940	and I especially can't say I like the idea that the team were actually going for the game they're making it into,
132940	135580	because that means they completely fucked up.
135600	141040	But it would be wrong of me to deny the fun I had, idly toiling in the universe of No Man's Sky.
143680	145680	Number 10, Brigador.
145680	148720	Brigador, formerly known as Matador according to Wikipedia,
148720	152480	went into early access in 2015, and I played it a tiny bit back then,
152480	156200	but when it came out fully this year, I went back to it and had a great time.
156200	159680	It's an isometric game in which you control a mech, tank, or flying car
159680	163760	through a highly destructible world and take out enemy vehicles and buildings.
163760	168620	There's a great mix of stealth, reflexive action, and tactics going on all at once in a great way,
168620	170140	and I just love the aesthetic.
170140	174020	It reminds me of a high-res version of early 90s PC games like Fallout,
174020	176300	complete with more advanced lighting effects.
176300	178460	The music is also absolutely fantastic.
178460	181220	There are some genuine bangers by Makeup and Vanity Set,
181220	184980	but every time I try to listen to them on their own, I have to stop and just go play the game.
184980	189660	It's relentlessly hard at times, and some of the vehicles seem ridiculously difficult on purpose,
189660	194400	but it's a lot of fun and quick enough that dying on an attempt doesn't feel like you wasted a lot of time.
194400	198060	I really love the sense of scope the game brings to the action.
198060	203160	You're usually going after specific targets, like an orbital relay or a few specific enemy machines,
203160	207000	but you can basically walk through buildings and almost everything else,
207000	209840	including people, and generally wreak a lot of havoc.
209840	212920	There's this great sense of purpose when buildings are going off all around you
212920	217960	and chain reaction explosions from gunfire and civilians are running away in their little yellow coats,
217960	223800	tiny victims of a greater battle that are completely ignored as you and the occupation duke it out for their ultimate fate.
223800	226240	These little touches add a lot of feeling to play,
226240	229260	and it makes Brigadier good enough that I put it in my top 11 list,
229260	231820	even though I played it technically last year.
231820	232920	I'm really bad at this!
232920	235420	Number nine, Hitman.
235420	237760	The Hitman games are mostly shite.
237760	241040	Each successive game feels like an unfinished beta for the next one.
241040	244660	The technology is never quite good enough to encapsulate the vision of a world
244660	248500	where you hit mans for money and have the freedom to do it lots of ways.
248500	251380	Hitman 1 is barely playable garbage fire.
251380	254420	Hitman 2 is technically a functional piece of software,
254420	257700	but it's critically un-fun to play the intended way and so on,
257700	261620	culminating in Blood Money, an actually pretty decent game with some fun stuff,
261620	263860	but which really doesn't hold up in retrospect.
263860	267300	And then there's its sequel, Hitman Subtitle—I mean, Hitman Absolution,
267300	271540	a very average Hitman game that crashed a third of the way through and deleted all my saves,
271540	274980	and I had no interest in replaying any of the levels to get back to where I was,
274980	277620	which, for a Hitman game, is a really bad sign.
277620	280500	My expectations for this game were incredibly low.
280500	283300	But actually playing it, it's really fun and cool.
283300	286500	It's less a case of the technology finally catching up with the vision
286500	289140	and more the vision itself changing and advancing,
289140	293140	as evidenced by the episodic setup and dramatically increased scope of the levels
293140	294740	and the options available to you.
294740	298180	The opportunity system is annoying because it spells out solutions to you,
298180	302740	and the AI sometimes seems all too prepared to feed the solution to you no matter what.
302740	306580	Hey, this Hitman guy looks like he could disguise himself
306580	309460	as this guy and go wherever he wanted in the building.
309460	313700	Oh, fuck you. You think it's so easy to be a fucking Hitman, you piece of shit?
313700	319140	Oh, look, a masseuse in a relatively unguarded area is gonna have a private massage
319140	321380	with the guy we have to ki—
321380	322500	Oh, just...
323380	323880	What?
324840	328440	It just—it even has a thing to tell you, like, it gives instructions,
328440	329960	gives you a map to where he is.
331080	333160	Oh, you've got an interview with the guy I've gotta kill, do you?
333160	337240	That's a nice thing to just keep saying out loud on repeat until I hear it.
337880	340440	If you think it's a fucking smart way, you do the assassination.
340440	341720	Here, here's my gun.
341720	343480	Here's my proximity device.
343480	349320	You do the fucking assassination if you think it's a fucking smart fucking piece of shit.
349320	350680	But you can turn that system off,
350760	355000	and overall, the game is good enough at presenting you with an intuitive but challenging situation
355000	357720	and letting you solve it yourself without much trial or error.
358840	359880	What's going on?
359880	363800	— What? — Police! Police!
363800	366280	It's the game Hitman was always supposed to have been,
366280	370200	and it's nice. It finally validates all the really bad ones I played through.
370200	372760	— Nothing there. — Who would've thought it?
375320	376840	Number eight, Superhot.
376840	378520	For those of you who haven't heard of Superhot—
378520	380840	Sorry, Superhot.
380840	385080	It's a game about a game where you play someone trying to pirate the game Superhot
385080	386680	and occasionally play betas,
386680	391720	which involve simple but stylish first-person action puzzles where time only moves when you move.
391720	394920	It's ridiculously pretty, and it manages to make a frenetic shooter
394920	398120	that you can slow down at any time still feel challenging.
398120	401320	Superhot is very short, but I've replayed it about eight times
401320	403800	because I like time-warping murder so much.
403800	407560	I can't wait to eventually somehow own all the exceedingly expensive equipment
407560	409960	required to play the Oculus Touch VR version,
409960	411880	which looks amazing, frankly,
411880	415960	and like the first game that might actually justify getting a VR setup like that.
415960	418600	Unfortunately, Santa Claus isn't real.
418600	419480	I'm sorry, kids.
420680	421560	It's your parents.
425960	427800	Number seven, Darkest Dungeon.
427800	432040	Double D is so good, I made an entire video about the feelings it gave me as I played it.
432040	436760	It's a very good RPG with people and home-based managing sections evocative of XCOM,
436760	438680	which is great, but what makes it even more awesome
438680	443400	is the feeling that the world's infectious evil is slowly turning you into a monster, too.
443400	447720	It's a type of game I will, in all likelihood, rip off at some point in the future in my own games.
447720	450520	It encourages a much more dehumanizing approach than XCOM,
450520	453240	where you recognize that these people are frail and expendable
453240	457480	and slowly become less and less attached to the dozens of people that move through your ranks.
457480	460840	In XCOM, you eventually start wanting to painstakingly save and reload
460840	463720	to preserve the high-level trooper you named after one of your friends
463720	466520	who you've been on so many adventures with at that point.
466520	469080	In Darkest Dungeon, you've named eight people after that friend,
469080	473160	and the latest one is definitely doomed, too, and already has a drinking problem.
473160	474920	Number six, Factorio.
474920	477720	I bought this game around midnight one day and played it for a bit.
477720	478680	It seemed pretty good.
478680	480680	I looked out my window, and it was getting light.
480680	484280	Then I played it a bit longer and looked out my window again, and it was dark.
484280	486840	I assumed I'd just been wrong about it getting light,
486840	490120	like my eyes had been deceiving me because I'd been looking at a screen for so long.
490120	493240	Then I checked the time on my phone, and it was 7 p.m. the next day.
494200	498200	I currently have 19 hours of playtime logged on Factorio,
498200	499960	and that was one session.
499960	500920	I didn't take any breaks.
501640	503880	I haven't even gone into the game yet to record the footage.
503880	505320	I'm filming this bit first.
505320	507640	Factorio is a game about automation.
507640	509880	You mine some materials to build a mining machine,
509880	512120	and then mine materials to fuel the mining machine,
512120	514520	and then use the materials the machine mines to build a machine
514520	517240	that mines the other stuff and feeds it into the other machines on its own,
517240	519880	and then 15 hours later, you've been using the oil you've been refining,
519880	522120	using the electricity that you gain from building other stuff
522200	524600	to start researching fuel and building a spaceship,
524600	526520	and you've built a giant Rube Goldberg machine
526520	529640	that, if you're smart, doesn't require any interaction by you.
529640	532600	It scratches an itch that only games can scratch,
532600	534280	and it does it incredibly well.
534280	537720	A mod for Minecraft back in the day added mining machines a bit like this,
537720	542920	and suddenly made Minecraft into a game that you could actually call fun and a game,
542920	546520	and you could build and manage pipes for all the masses of materials you were digging up.
546520	549800	I believe the developers worked on one such mod, uh, I think.
549800	552200	I love Factorio, and if I stop making videos,
552200	555640	it's probably because I died in my chair playing it and forgot to eat.
555640	557400	The only reason I haven't rated it higher
557400	560520	is because it's not exactly got an emotionally fulfilling story,
560520	565160	and it only really appeals to the childlike urge to build systems and watch them go.
565160	567160	The game could be called repetitive,
567160	570760	but I don't think it's a kind of repetition I could ever personally get bored with.
570760	574600	I can't imagine what the game will be like when it's actually finished and out of early access,
574600	576600	because I already think it's just—
576600	579080	it's—it's so good at what it does right now.
579080	581160	Maybe whenever there's eventually an official release,
581160	583560	I'll dive back in and then never come out.
584200	586200	Ah, it's gonna be so good, guys.
586200	588280	I'm gonna die playing a video game!
588280	590520	Number five, Lady Killer in a Bind.
591080	592760	Okay, I'm gonna level with you.
592760	595560	Lady Killer in a Bind is a visual novel
595560	601080	which frequently depicts sections wherein the characters are having sex.
602040	605320	But I would be hard-pressed to actually call it pornography.
605320	609560	It's deeply concerned with the ideas and voices and pretensions of its characters.
609560	611640	So many lines are quotable and funny,
611640	615880	or feel like they have an actual point to make about how humans relate to one another.
615880	620040	It's clear that a lot of time went into polishing the precise feel every scene has.
620040	623240	Every word and choice and piece of music fits perfectly,
623240	627560	and the music even slides into a nice menu version when you go to save.
627560	629800	The story can develop in quite a few different directions
629800	633480	based on the myriad choices you can make about where to spend your time on the cruise ship
633480	636120	trying to win an absurd popularity contest.
636120	640600	Christine Love, the creator who also made Analog A Hate Story and Hate Plus,
640600	645720	didn't just write some words and put some art next to them that occasionally depict sex.
645720	648600	There's an appreciable precision to it.
648600	650920	Love is very concerned with video game fashion,
650920	651880	and it shows.
651880	653640	Every character is style-in,
653640	657240	and also changes into equally style-in new clothes every day.
657240	660040	You know, like a person would actually do.
660040	663800	I would be lying if I said I didn't have at least two outfits I wear in public
663800	666680	that I stole directly from the main character's wardrobe.
666680	669320	Incidentally, a recent patch added a work-safe mode
669320	672680	that adds delightfully garish Christmas sweaters to the sex scenes.
674280	675400	This is a coincidence?
675400	677880	It's—it's—it's—it's really good,
677880	683720	and I'd recommend it if you're into the idea of playing the most long-form
683720	689160	and emotionally engaging pieces of what could technically be called erotica ever made.
689160	691720	I've heard rumblings that it's even coming out on Steam,
691720	694440	and Steam only slightly lets porn onto its platform,
694440	696600	so you know it has to be some of the good stuff, right?
696600	698360	Number four, video ball.
704200	706280	Video ball is the new sport.
706280	709800	It's asteroids meets pong meets table tennis meets another world.
709800	713480	Heck, it's such a specific mishmash that that comparison doesn't really work
713480	715720	because it feels so unique on its own.
715720	717240	Everything is delineated easily,
717240	718520	so you understand what's happening
718520	721320	without needing to have played it for dozens of hours yourself.
721320	724200	I'm looking at you, all MOBAs.
724200	728600	I love this game, but there's a downside to placing it so high on my list.
728600	732280	I can't really recommend video ball because not many people play it.
732280	736280	It's really hard to find a game, and the netcode isn't too great,
736280	737480	and since it didn't sell well,
737480	740920	a lot of the patches to improve this stuff are probably never gonna materialize,
740920	742280	and that's a damn shame.
742280	744440	It's a travesty that there aren't a hundred people
744440	746760	constantly playing it at all times to join in with.
746760	750920	This was basically the only game I'd allowed myself to get hyped about for years.
750920	753640	I even drove to Birmingham to see it before its release.
753640	755320	It's as good as I'd hoped it to be,
755320	758360	but I'm still disappointed because I rarely get to play it.
758360	761320	Instead, I'll recommend whatever Tim Rogers makes next.
761320	764040	I've decided that he deserves your money.
764040	765640	But if you feel like giving it a shot,
765640	769000	join the official Discord and arrange games through there with other players.
769000	771240	I quite like the community aspect in that regard,
771240	774920	but I don't like how it means everyone's better than me.
775000	776360	It's not an e-sport.
776360	777960	It's an A-sport.
777960	779400	Because it's so good.
780040	783800	I-I-I-I told that joke to Tim Rogers, the creator,
783800	785880	when he was at a convention showing the game off,
785880	788760	and he tried to hide it,
788760	791480	but he very obviously winced a little bit.
792200	793720	Number three, Skyrim remastered.
795240	796680	Number three, Lisa.
796680	798680	Lisa was a late 2014 release,
798680	801160	but I only got around to it in early February this year
801160	803400	because I'm a failed human.
803400	805800	Luckily, failure's what Lisa's all about.
805800	808040	You play a drug addict called Brad in a world
808040	810600	where all the women spontaneously disappeared one day,
810600	813000	so, of course, society completely collapsed
813000	815960	and is now a wasteland where dirty magazines are currency.
815960	818840	Brad attempts to secretly raise a baby girl he finds one day,
818840	821320	but eventually everyone finds out and goes after her,
821320	823560	and Brad undergoes a series of bad times
823560	827080	and hallucinatory relivings of childhood trauma in order to save her.
827080	829560	The game has a very cool but uncanny soundtrack
829560	831960	that adds to a terrific sense of unease.
831960	835320	Not just the feeling that the world sucks and things might not end well,
835320	838120	but that your actions are directly making everything worse.
838120	840680	At numerous points, Brad is presented with critical choices
840680	843320	like which party members to subject to Russian roulette
843320	846360	or whether or not to lose everything he has or one of his arms,
846360	848280	and the consequences are real.
848280	850760	Over the course of the game, you can unexpectedly lose friends,
850760	851960	not even for story reasons.
851960	854360	They can just get ganked by a dangerous world,
854360	857640	and Brad can even end up losing both of his arms.
857640	860760	The tone can be puzzling and take some time to get accustomed to,
860760	865000	but it's worth it, and I had a really good time feeling bad and sad
865000	868440	and like I was only hurting the people I loved by trying to be the hero.
868440	872120	I intend to make a video exploring Lisa in more detail at some point in the future,
872120	873560	but basically, it's great.
873560	875560	Number two, Undertale.
876280	879480	Everything about Undertale has already been said, including by me.
879480	881640	I played it late because I tried to avoid hype,
881640	884040	so for me, it gets to be a 2016 game.
884040	886440	It's really good, and you'd better have played it by now.
886440	887960	Don't leave it like I did.
887960	889720	At this point, it's been talked about so much
889720	891000	that I'd rather just recommend it
891000	893720	and assume you've either heard the reasons before or played it.
893720	895240	Just—just—just do it.
895240	896040	Please.
896040	899800	Undertale only slightly beats out Lisa by having even better music
899800	903400	and, more importantly, more electro swing remixes on YouTube.
903400	905080	I wouldn't rate one higher than the other
905080	909240	if I weren't forcing myself for the purposes of a dumb reductionist game of the year list.
909240	912120	They're very, very different games despite both being RPGs,
912120	913560	and I would recommend both,
913560	917640	but I recommend Lisa more often because far less people seem to have heard of it.
917640	921080	The downside to Undertale's massive popularity and reception by fans
921080	924280	is it's probably immensely damaged Toby Fox's psyche
924280	928040	and led him to believe he can never top it and make him maybe stop making games,
928040	932440	whereas Austin Jorgensen is actively and openly working on his next game, Ninja Tears,
932440	935400	which I can't wait for, so that's pretty nice.
935400	937240	Number one, Bloodborne.
937240	940360	Yes, that game I spent 90 minutes calling amazing over and over
940360	942120	is my favorite game of this year,
942120	946120	and it's my favorite game of this year because I only got a PS4 pretty recently.
946120	948440	It's also the only game I own on the PS4,
948440	950360	and I feel like it was worth the price of entry.
950360	951960	I'm currently working through the DLC,
951960	955160	dying to this guy in five seconds over and over and over.
955160	957880	Expect a video about the DLC at some point in the future.
958440	958920	Maybe.
958920	961400	I'll have to see if I think I have anything worth saying about it,
961400	962760	and if people are interested.
963400	964200	So there you have it.
964200	965960	My favorite game of 2016.
965960	967640	A game from 2050.
967640	968140	Fuck!
969000	969480	Fuck!
969480	970200	This isn't fair!
970200	970920	This isn't right!
970920	971720	I can't! I can't!
972280	972780	It's not!
973320	974040	I can't!
974040	978280	The actual game of the year can't be a game from last year.
978280	978780	That...
979800	980840	That's really stupid.
981640	983960	But luckily, this whole thing's fucking scripted.
983960	985880	I have an actual game of the year from this year.
986520	987480	Number one, or I guess...
988040	990200	Bloodborne is kind of, like, one of my favorite things I did this year,
990200	992680	so I guess the number zero is...
993800	996760	Doom!
996760	997880	Oh my goodness!
997880	999560	What a shock this turned out to be.
999560	1002600	They made another Doom, and it wasn't just average.
1002600	1004520	It wasn't just another first-person shooter.
1004520	1006920	It wasn't just a remake of the original's mechanics,
1006920	1009800	or those of the underrated but not-Doomy Doom 3.
1009800	1012680	And it wasn't just nicking mechanics from other modern shooters.
1012680	1014920	Calling Doom the best first-person shooter
1014920	1017800	implies it's even in the same category as those, and it's not.
1017800	1020200	If anything, it's the first of something else entirely.
1020200	1022760	Not the last of the old, but the first of something new.
1023320	1027400	Fights have a speed, a rhythm, a pace, an ebb and flow of health and ammunition
1027400	1030440	that utterly destroys the mechanical design of early shooters
1030440	1034680	and the regenerating health, take cover, and wait a while nonsense of later stuff.
1034680	1038200	The movement is slick, but just slow enough to feel deliberate,
1038200	1040520	and the glory kills look and feel great.
1040520	1042840	They're integrated well into the rest of the health system.
1042840	1045160	The soundtrack pauses briefly, and it's just...
1045160	1045880	Oh!
1045880	1049400	And there are so many different ones for different angles and height differences,
1049400	1053000	and they never feel anywhere near as bullshit and repetitive as they could have done.
1053000	1053800	Cough, cough.
1053800	1055480	Deus Ex takedowns.
1055480	1059320	There's even a beautiful philosophical approach reflected in the Doom Marine's actions,
1059320	1062280	where he chooses to wordlessly ignore the information that
1062280	1065880	Argent Devil Doom Evil Bad Energy can technically be used for good
1065880	1068360	with only the occasional Nightmare Holocaust.
1068360	1069880	You must stop.
1069880	1073640	The Hell Energy is unusable without the filters.
1077320	1079320	Because it's good to oppose something outright,
1079320	1081640	even if it can supposedly have positive effects
1081640	1085240	if you ignore how it's also causing the downfall of civilization.
1085240	1087400	I hope there's a DLC that's just...
1087400	1090520	the Doom Marine standing in front of robot Steve Jobs
1090520	1093640	and just kicking the shit out of the new iPhone just repeatedly.
1093640	1097240	Entire books have been written about the engine and level design of the first two Dooms,
1097240	1101000	and entire books will, or at least should, be written about this one.
1101000	1105080	A glorious new era of action games is waiting to be brought into existence,
1105080	1108680	and many of the tools for building them are sitting right here.
1108680	1111960	The one downside—the ONE downside to New Doom
1111960	1115080	is Bethesda saw its massive success as proof that it's a good idea
1115080	1119160	to continue to have shitty business practices that promise to only hurt the games industry
1119160	1122920	and reduce its chances of making those potential good games I just talked about.
1122920	1126040	Oh yeah, you voted for it on Twitter, and I didn't forget.
1126040	1128520	I'm just lazy and fat and disgusting.
1128520	1131880	Next time we're going to look into why Bethesda's policies promise to make it
1131880	1135480	one of the worst game development companies ever,
1135480	1138840	long into 2017 and doubtless all the rest of the years,
1138840	1142600	and not for the regular reason of all the bad games that they keep making.
1156840	1159400	Thanks for watching. I just ate three walnut whips.
1159400	1160680	How's your Christmas going?
1161320	1162680	I've got a whole bunch of plans for next year.
1162680	1166200	I've got a whole bunch of bonus material I found on a hard drive that I thought was broken
1166200	1167960	but actually was just not plugged in properly.
1168920	1172920	I want to finish the Dark Souls 2 apologetics video, which is going pretty well,
1172920	1174920	but I thought I'd re-record loads of bits of it
1174920	1177320	because otherwise it's just things I cut out of the Bloodborne video,
1177320	1179160	and I feel like it needs to be even more cohesive.
1179160	1180440	I like to pace things properly.
1181320	1190360	Oh, also, a Swedish bodybuilding Nazi tried to copyright claim one of my videos!
1190360	1192520	So we might have to talk about that at some point, too.
1192520	1193320	See ya!
1198040	1205320	So
1219240	1222280	I realized that I actually have to bring the camera in with me.
