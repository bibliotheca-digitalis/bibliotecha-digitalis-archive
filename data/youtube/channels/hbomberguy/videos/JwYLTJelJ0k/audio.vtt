00:00.000 --> 00:03.580
I wonder if I can get Max to do a version of this intro with sleigh bells. Hold on.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.500
Ah, he's busy. It's Christmas. Goddamnit.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.520
Hello, friends.

00:07.520 --> 00:10.060
Christmas is upon us once more, as you can tell.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.320
And you know what that means? Spending time with the people you love.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.560
By which I mean...

00:15.000 --> 00:16.540
there's a Steam sale on.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.560
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

00:19.560 --> 00:21.980
So to celebrate the great games of 2016,

00:21.980 --> 00:25.420
give a couple of recommendations for stuff you might as well get while it's on sale,

00:25.420 --> 00:28.260
and figure out what my personal game of the year is,

00:28.300 --> 00:31.800
I thought I'd give my top 11 games of 2016.

00:32.260 --> 00:33.080
Why 11?

00:33.700 --> 00:34.200
Because I-

00:34.600 --> 00:38.460
Oh, by the way, some games will be games that didn't necessarily come out in 2016,

00:38.460 --> 00:41.000
but which I happened to play for the first time this year.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.920
Some games aren't even out yet, thanks to the magic of Steam Early Access.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.500
I didn't plan this list out very well.

00:48.100 --> 00:48.600
Oops.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.600
Number 11, No Man's Sky.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.600
That's right. This year I did the most dangerous thing you can do on the internet.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.340
I like to game more than the people who make angry rants about them for attention.

00:58.960 --> 01:04.420
I don't watch trailers, or read press releases, or pay attention to the endless speculation about future games

01:04.420 --> 01:07.940
that might be so good they eradicate the inherent ennui of being mortal.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.460
So my hopes were never raised.

01:09.460 --> 01:14.660
I didn't need No Man's Sky to be anything, so my expectations couldn't be betrayed.

01:14.900 --> 01:21.380
I let the game be what it was, and what it was was big and empty and beautiful and lonely and impersonal.

01:21.600 --> 01:26.400
It was like reading The Road, only marginally less depressing and far better written.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.080
Look, sorry, Cormac, it's really not your best. The movie was better.

01:29.080 --> 01:34.080
I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I really liked it, and you can't stop me.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.440
They're updating it to slowly add stuff I didn't think it needed all that much,

01:37.440 --> 01:40.080
and make it more like the game everyone else wanted it to be.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.200
So when it finishes up doing all that in the minimum two years required to make it into that game,

01:45.200 --> 01:49.120
I'm sure everyone else will finally check it out for five minutes and go,

01:49.260 --> 01:54.300
Eh, I guess it's pretty good, and then turn it off and go back to playing Star Citizen,

01:54.300 --> 01:56.300
which I'm sure will be out by then.

01:56.460 --> 02:02.940
But the stripped-down experience of a loose, almost aimless journey through the vast yet mundane reaches of space

02:02.940 --> 02:05.020
got me in a really big way.

02:05.020 --> 02:07.340
I can't say I like the changes that are being made,

02:07.340 --> 02:12.940
and I especially can't say I like the idea that the team were actually going for the game they're making it into,

02:12.940 --> 02:15.580
because that means they completely fucked up.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.040
But it would be wrong of me to deny the fun I had, idly toiling in the universe of No Man's Sky.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.680
Number 10, Brigador.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.720
Brigador, formerly known as Matador according to Wikipedia,

02:28.720 --> 02:32.480
went into early access in 2015, and I played it a tiny bit back then,

02:32.480 --> 02:36.200
but when it came out fully this year, I went back to it and had a great time.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.680
It's an isometric game in which you control a mech, tank, or flying car

02:39.680 --> 02:43.760
through a highly destructible world and take out enemy vehicles and buildings.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.620
There's a great mix of stealth, reflexive action, and tactics going on all at once in a great way,

02:48.620 --> 02:50.140
and I just love the aesthetic.

02:50.140 --> 02:54.020
It reminds me of a high-res version of early 90s PC games like Fallout,

02:54.020 --> 02:56.300
complete with more advanced lighting effects.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.460
The music is also absolutely fantastic.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.220
There are some genuine bangers by Makeup and Vanity Set,

03:01.220 --> 03:04.980
but every time I try to listen to them on their own, I have to stop and just go play the game.

03:04.980 --> 03:09.660
It's relentlessly hard at times, and some of the vehicles seem ridiculously difficult on purpose,

03:09.660 --> 03:14.400
but it's a lot of fun and quick enough that dying on an attempt doesn't feel like you wasted a lot of time.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.060
I really love the sense of scope the game brings to the action.

03:18.060 --> 03:23.160
You're usually going after specific targets, like an orbital relay or a few specific enemy machines,

03:23.160 --> 03:27.000
but you can basically walk through buildings and almost everything else,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.840
including people, and generally wreak a lot of havoc.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.920
There's this great sense of purpose when buildings are going off all around you

03:32.920 --> 03:37.960
and chain reaction explosions from gunfire and civilians are running away in their little yellow coats,

03:37.960 --> 03:43.800
tiny victims of a greater battle that are completely ignored as you and the occupation duke it out for their ultimate fate.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.240
These little touches add a lot of feeling to play,

03:46.240 --> 03:49.260
and it makes Brigadier good enough that I put it in my top 11 list,

03:49.260 --> 03:51.820
even though I played it technically last year.

03:51.820 --> 03:52.920
I'm really bad at this!

03:52.920 --> 03:55.420
Number nine, Hitman.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.760
The Hitman games are mostly shite.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.040
Each successive game feels like an unfinished beta for the next one.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.660
The technology is never quite good enough to encapsulate the vision of a world

04:04.660 --> 04:08.500
where you hit mans for money and have the freedom to do it lots of ways.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.380
Hitman 1 is barely playable garbage fire.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.420
Hitman 2 is technically a functional piece of software,

04:14.420 --> 04:17.700
but it's critically un-fun to play the intended way and so on,

04:17.700 --> 04:21.620
culminating in Blood Money, an actually pretty decent game with some fun stuff,

04:21.620 --> 04:23.860
but which really doesn't hold up in retrospect.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.300
And then there's its sequel, Hitman Subtitle—I mean, Hitman Absolution,

04:27.300 --> 04:31.540
a very average Hitman game that crashed a third of the way through and deleted all my saves,

04:31.540 --> 04:34.980
and I had no interest in replaying any of the levels to get back to where I was,

04:34.980 --> 04:37.620
which, for a Hitman game, is a really bad sign.

04:37.620 --> 04:40.500
My expectations for this game were incredibly low.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.300
But actually playing it, it's really fun and cool.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.500
It's less a case of the technology finally catching up with the vision

04:46.500 --> 04:49.140
and more the vision itself changing and advancing,

04:49.140 --> 04:53.140
as evidenced by the episodic setup and dramatically increased scope of the levels

04:53.140 --> 04:54.740
and the options available to you.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.180
The opportunity system is annoying because it spells out solutions to you,

04:58.180 --> 05:02.740
and the AI sometimes seems all too prepared to feed the solution to you no matter what.

05:02.740 --> 05:06.580
Hey, this Hitman guy looks like he could disguise himself

05:06.580 --> 05:09.460
as this guy and go wherever he wanted in the building.

05:09.460 --> 05:13.700
Oh, fuck you. You think it's so easy to be a fucking Hitman, you piece of shit?

05:13.700 --> 05:19.140
Oh, look, a masseuse in a relatively unguarded area is gonna have a private massage

05:19.140 --> 05:21.380
with the guy we have to ki—

05:21.380 --> 05:22.500
Oh, just...

05:23.380 --> 05:23.880
What?

05:24.840 --> 05:28.440
It just—it even has a thing to tell you, like, it gives instructions,

05:28.440 --> 05:29.960
gives you a map to where he is.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.160
Oh, you've got an interview with the guy I've gotta kill, do you?

05:33.160 --> 05:37.240
That's a nice thing to just keep saying out loud on repeat until I hear it.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.440
If you think it's a fucking smart way, you do the assassination.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.720
Here, here's my gun.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.480
Here's my proximity device.

05:43.480 --> 05:49.320
You do the fucking assassination if you think it's a fucking smart fucking piece of shit.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.680
But you can turn that system off,

05:50.760 --> 05:55.000
and overall, the game is good enough at presenting you with an intuitive but challenging situation

05:55.000 --> 05:57.720
and letting you solve it yourself without much trial or error.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.880
What's going on?

05:59.880 --> 06:03.800
— What? — Police! Police!

06:03.800 --> 06:06.280
It's the game Hitman was always supposed to have been,

06:06.280 --> 06:10.200
and it's nice. It finally validates all the really bad ones I played through.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.760
— Nothing there. — Who would've thought it?

06:15.320 --> 06:16.840
Number eight, Superhot.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.520
For those of you who haven't heard of Superhot—

06:18.520 --> 06:20.840
Sorry, Superhot.

06:20.840 --> 06:25.080
It's a game about a game where you play someone trying to pirate the game Superhot

06:25.080 --> 06:26.680
and occasionally play betas,

06:26.680 --> 06:31.720
which involve simple but stylish first-person action puzzles where time only moves when you move.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.920
It's ridiculously pretty, and it manages to make a frenetic shooter

06:34.920 --> 06:38.120
that you can slow down at any time still feel challenging.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.320
Superhot is very short, but I've replayed it about eight times

06:41.320 --> 06:43.800
because I like time-warping murder so much.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.560
I can't wait to eventually somehow own all the exceedingly expensive equipment

06:47.560 --> 06:49.960
required to play the Oculus Touch VR version,

06:49.960 --> 06:51.880
which looks amazing, frankly,

06:51.880 --> 06:55.960
and like the first game that might actually justify getting a VR setup like that.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.600
Unfortunately, Santa Claus isn't real.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.480
I'm sorry, kids.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.560
It's your parents.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.800
Number seven, Darkest Dungeon.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.040
Double D is so good, I made an entire video about the feelings it gave me as I played it.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.760
It's a very good RPG with people and home-based managing sections evocative of XCOM,

07:16.760 --> 07:18.680
which is great, but what makes it even more awesome

07:18.680 --> 07:23.400
is the feeling that the world's infectious evil is slowly turning you into a monster, too.

07:23.400 --> 07:27.720
It's a type of game I will, in all likelihood, rip off at some point in the future in my own games.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.520
It encourages a much more dehumanizing approach than XCOM,

07:30.520 --> 07:33.240
where you recognize that these people are frail and expendable

07:33.240 --> 07:37.480
and slowly become less and less attached to the dozens of people that move through your ranks.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.840
In XCOM, you eventually start wanting to painstakingly save and reload

07:40.840 --> 07:43.720
to preserve the high-level trooper you named after one of your friends

07:43.720 --> 07:46.520
who you've been on so many adventures with at that point.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.080
In Darkest Dungeon, you've named eight people after that friend,

07:49.080 --> 07:53.160
and the latest one is definitely doomed, too, and already has a drinking problem.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.920
Number six, Factorio.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.720
I bought this game around midnight one day and played it for a bit.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.680
It seemed pretty good.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.680
I looked out my window, and it was getting light.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.280
Then I played it a bit longer and looked out my window again, and it was dark.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.840
I assumed I'd just been wrong about it getting light,

08:06.840 --> 08:10.120
like my eyes had been deceiving me because I'd been looking at a screen for so long.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.240
Then I checked the time on my phone, and it was 7 p.m. the next day.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.200
I currently have 19 hours of playtime logged on Factorio,

08:18.200 --> 08:19.960
and that was one session.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.920
I didn't take any breaks.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.880
I haven't even gone into the game yet to record the footage.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.320
I'm filming this bit first.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.640
Factorio is a game about automation.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.880
You mine some materials to build a mining machine,

08:29.880 --> 08:32.120
and then mine materials to fuel the mining machine,

08:32.120 --> 08:34.520
and then use the materials the machine mines to build a machine

08:34.520 --> 08:37.240
that mines the other stuff and feeds it into the other machines on its own,

08:37.240 --> 08:39.880
and then 15 hours later, you've been using the oil you've been refining,

08:39.880 --> 08:42.120
using the electricity that you gain from building other stuff

08:42.200 --> 08:44.600
to start researching fuel and building a spaceship,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.520
and you've built a giant Rube Goldberg machine

08:46.520 --> 08:49.640
that, if you're smart, doesn't require any interaction by you.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.600
It scratches an itch that only games can scratch,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.280
and it does it incredibly well.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.720
A mod for Minecraft back in the day added mining machines a bit like this,

08:57.720 --> 09:02.920
and suddenly made Minecraft into a game that you could actually call fun and a game,

09:02.920 --> 09:06.520
and you could build and manage pipes for all the masses of materials you were digging up.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.800
I believe the developers worked on one such mod, uh, I think.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.200
I love Factorio, and if I stop making videos,

09:12.200 --> 09:15.640
it's probably because I died in my chair playing it and forgot to eat.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.400
The only reason I haven't rated it higher

09:17.400 --> 09:20.520
is because it's not exactly got an emotionally fulfilling story,

09:20.520 --> 09:25.160
and it only really appeals to the childlike urge to build systems and watch them go.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.160
The game could be called repetitive,

09:27.160 --> 09:30.760
but I don't think it's a kind of repetition I could ever personally get bored with.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.600
I can't imagine what the game will be like when it's actually finished and out of early access,

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
because I already think it's just—

09:36.600 --> 09:39.080
it's—it's so good at what it does right now.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.160
Maybe whenever there's eventually an official release,

09:41.160 --> 09:43.560
I'll dive back in and then never come out.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.200
Ah, it's gonna be so good, guys.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.280
I'm gonna die playing a video game!

09:48.280 --> 09:50.520
Number five, Lady Killer in a Bind.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.760
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.560
Lady Killer in a Bind is a visual novel

09:55.560 --> 10:01.080
which frequently depicts sections wherein the characters are having sex.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.320
But I would be hard-pressed to actually call it pornography.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.560
It's deeply concerned with the ideas and voices and pretensions of its characters.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.640
So many lines are quotable and funny,

10:11.640 --> 10:15.880
or feel like they have an actual point to make about how humans relate to one another.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.040
It's clear that a lot of time went into polishing the precise feel every scene has.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.240
Every word and choice and piece of music fits perfectly,

10:23.240 --> 10:27.560
and the music even slides into a nice menu version when you go to save.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.800
The story can develop in quite a few different directions

10:29.800 --> 10:33.480
based on the myriad choices you can make about where to spend your time on the cruise ship

10:33.480 --> 10:36.120
trying to win an absurd popularity contest.

10:36.120 --> 10:40.600
Christine Love, the creator who also made Analog A Hate Story and Hate Plus,

10:40.600 --> 10:45.720
didn't just write some words and put some art next to them that occasionally depict sex.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.600
There's an appreciable precision to it.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.920
Love is very concerned with video game fashion,

10:50.920 --> 10:51.880
and it shows.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.640
Every character is style-in,

10:53.640 --> 10:57.240
and also changes into equally style-in new clothes every day.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.040
You know, like a person would actually do.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.800
I would be lying if I said I didn't have at least two outfits I wear in public

11:03.800 --> 11:06.680
that I stole directly from the main character's wardrobe.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.320
Incidentally, a recent patch added a work-safe mode

11:09.320 --> 11:12.680
that adds delightfully garish Christmas sweaters to the sex scenes.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.400
This is a coincidence?

11:15.400 --> 11:17.880
It's—it's—it's—it's really good,

11:17.880 --> 11:23.720
and I'd recommend it if you're into the idea of playing the most long-form

11:23.720 --> 11:29.160
and emotionally engaging pieces of what could technically be called erotica ever made.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.720
I've heard rumblings that it's even coming out on Steam,

11:31.720 --> 11:34.440
and Steam only slightly lets porn onto its platform,

11:34.440 --> 11:36.600
so you know it has to be some of the good stuff, right?

11:36.600 --> 11:38.360
Number four, video ball.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.280
Video ball is the new sport.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.800
It's asteroids meets pong meets table tennis meets another world.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.480
Heck, it's such a specific mishmash that that comparison doesn't really work

11:53.480 --> 11:55.720
because it feels so unique on its own.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.240
Everything is delineated easily,

11:57.240 --> 11:58.520
so you understand what's happening

11:58.520 --> 12:01.320
without needing to have played it for dozens of hours yourself.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.200
I'm looking at you, all MOBAs.

12:04.200 --> 12:08.600
I love this game, but there's a downside to placing it so high on my list.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.280
I can't really recommend video ball because not many people play it.

12:12.280 --> 12:16.280
It's really hard to find a game, and the netcode isn't too great,

12:16.280 --> 12:17.480
and since it didn't sell well,

12:17.480 --> 12:20.920
a lot of the patches to improve this stuff are probably never gonna materialize,

12:20.920 --> 12:22.280
and that's a damn shame.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.440
It's a travesty that there aren't a hundred people

12:24.440 --> 12:26.760
constantly playing it at all times to join in with.

12:26.760 --> 12:30.920
This was basically the only game I'd allowed myself to get hyped about for years.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.640
I even drove to Birmingham to see it before its release.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.320
It's as good as I'd hoped it to be,

12:35.320 --> 12:38.360
but I'm still disappointed because I rarely get to play it.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.320
Instead, I'll recommend whatever Tim Rogers makes next.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.040
I've decided that he deserves your money.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.640
But if you feel like giving it a shot,

12:45.640 --> 12:49.000
join the official Discord and arrange games through there with other players.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.240
I quite like the community aspect in that regard,

12:51.240 --> 12:54.920
but I don't like how it means everyone's better than me.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.360
It's not an e-sport.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.960
It's an A-sport.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.400
Because it's so good.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.800
I-I-I-I told that joke to Tim Rogers, the creator,

13:03.800 --> 13:05.880
when he was at a convention showing the game off,

13:05.880 --> 13:08.760
and he tried to hide it,

13:08.760 --> 13:11.480
but he very obviously winced a little bit.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.720
Number three, Skyrim remastered.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.680
Number three, Lisa.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.680
Lisa was a late 2014 release,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.160
but I only got around to it in early February this year

13:21.160 --> 13:23.400
because I'm a failed human.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.800
Luckily, failure's what Lisa's all about.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.040
You play a drug addict called Brad in a world

13:28.040 --> 13:30.600
where all the women spontaneously disappeared one day,

13:30.600 --> 13:33.000
so, of course, society completely collapsed

13:33.000 --> 13:35.960
and is now a wasteland where dirty magazines are currency.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.840
Brad attempts to secretly raise a baby girl he finds one day,

13:38.840 --> 13:41.320
but eventually everyone finds out and goes after her,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.560
and Brad undergoes a series of bad times

13:43.560 --> 13:47.080
and hallucinatory relivings of childhood trauma in order to save her.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.560
The game has a very cool but uncanny soundtrack

13:49.560 --> 13:51.960
that adds to a terrific sense of unease.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.320
Not just the feeling that the world sucks and things might not end well,

13:55.320 --> 13:58.120
but that your actions are directly making everything worse.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.680
At numerous points, Brad is presented with critical choices

14:00.680 --> 14:03.320
like which party members to subject to Russian roulette

14:03.320 --> 14:06.360
or whether or not to lose everything he has or one of his arms,

14:06.360 --> 14:08.280
and the consequences are real.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.760
Over the course of the game, you can unexpectedly lose friends,

14:10.760 --> 14:11.960
not even for story reasons.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.360
They can just get ganked by a dangerous world,

14:14.360 --> 14:17.640
and Brad can even end up losing both of his arms.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.760
The tone can be puzzling and take some time to get accustomed to,

14:20.760 --> 14:25.000
but it's worth it, and I had a really good time feeling bad and sad

14:25.000 --> 14:28.440
and like I was only hurting the people I loved by trying to be the hero.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.120
I intend to make a video exploring Lisa in more detail at some point in the future,

14:32.120 --> 14:33.560
but basically, it's great.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.560
Number two, Undertale.

14:36.280 --> 14:39.480
Everything about Undertale has already been said, including by me.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.640
I played it late because I tried to avoid hype,

14:41.640 --> 14:44.040
so for me, it gets to be a 2016 game.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.440
It's really good, and you'd better have played it by now.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.960
Don't leave it like I did.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.720
At this point, it's been talked about so much

14:49.720 --> 14:51.000
that I'd rather just recommend it

14:51.000 --> 14:53.720
and assume you've either heard the reasons before or played it.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.240
Just—just—just do it.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.040
Please.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.800
Undertale only slightly beats out Lisa by having even better music

14:59.800 --> 15:03.400
and, more importantly, more electro swing remixes on YouTube.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.080
I wouldn't rate one higher than the other

15:05.080 --> 15:09.240
if I weren't forcing myself for the purposes of a dumb reductionist game of the year list.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.120
They're very, very different games despite both being RPGs,

15:12.120 --> 15:13.560
and I would recommend both,

15:13.560 --> 15:17.640
but I recommend Lisa more often because far less people seem to have heard of it.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.080
The downside to Undertale's massive popularity and reception by fans

15:21.080 --> 15:24.280
is it's probably immensely damaged Toby Fox's psyche

15:24.280 --> 15:28.040
and led him to believe he can never top it and make him maybe stop making games,

15:28.040 --> 15:32.440
whereas Austin Jorgensen is actively and openly working on his next game, Ninja Tears,

15:32.440 --> 15:35.400
which I can't wait for, so that's pretty nice.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.240
Number one, Bloodborne.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.360
Yes, that game I spent 90 minutes calling amazing over and over

15:40.360 --> 15:42.120
is my favorite game of this year,

15:42.120 --> 15:46.120
and it's my favorite game of this year because I only got a PS4 pretty recently.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.440
It's also the only game I own on the PS4,

15:48.440 --> 15:50.360
and I feel like it was worth the price of entry.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.960
I'm currently working through the DLC,

15:51.960 --> 15:55.160
dying to this guy in five seconds over and over and over.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.880
Expect a video about the DLC at some point in the future.

15:58.440 --> 15:58.920
Maybe.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.400
I'll have to see if I think I have anything worth saying about it,

16:01.400 --> 16:02.760
and if people are interested.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.200
So there you have it.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.960
My favorite game of 2016.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.640
A game from 2050.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.140
Fuck!

16:09.000 --> 16:09.480
Fuck!

16:09.480 --> 16:10.200
This isn't fair!

16:10.200 --> 16:10.920
This isn't right!

16:10.920 --> 16:11.720
I can't! I can't!

16:12.280 --> 16:12.780
It's not!

16:13.320 --> 16:14.040
I can't!

16:14.040 --> 16:18.280
The actual game of the year can't be a game from last year.

16:18.280 --> 16:18.780
That...

16:19.800 --> 16:20.840
That's really stupid.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.960
But luckily, this whole thing's fucking scripted.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.880
I have an actual game of the year from this year.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.480
Number one, or I guess...

16:28.040 --> 16:30.200
Bloodborne is kind of, like, one of my favorite things I did this year,

16:30.200 --> 16:32.680
so I guess the number zero is...

16:33.800 --> 16:36.760
Doom!

16:36.760 --> 16:37.880
Oh my goodness!

16:37.880 --> 16:39.560
What a shock this turned out to be.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.600
They made another Doom, and it wasn't just average.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.520
It wasn't just another first-person shooter.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.920
It wasn't just a remake of the original's mechanics,

16:46.920 --> 16:49.800
or those of the underrated but not-Doomy Doom 3.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.680
And it wasn't just nicking mechanics from other modern shooters.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.920
Calling Doom the best first-person shooter

16:54.920 --> 16:57.800
implies it's even in the same category as those, and it's not.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.200
If anything, it's the first of something else entirely.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.760
Not the last of the old, but the first of something new.

17:03.320 --> 17:07.400
Fights have a speed, a rhythm, a pace, an ebb and flow of health and ammunition

17:07.400 --> 17:10.440
that utterly destroys the mechanical design of early shooters

17:10.440 --> 17:14.680
and the regenerating health, take cover, and wait a while nonsense of later stuff.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.200
The movement is slick, but just slow enough to feel deliberate,

17:18.200 --> 17:20.520
and the glory kills look and feel great.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.840
They're integrated well into the rest of the health system.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.160
The soundtrack pauses briefly, and it's just...

17:25.160 --> 17:25.880
Oh!

17:25.880 --> 17:29.400
And there are so many different ones for different angles and height differences,

17:29.400 --> 17:33.000
and they never feel anywhere near as bullshit and repetitive as they could have done.

17:33.000 --> 17:33.800
Cough, cough.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.480
Deus Ex takedowns.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.320
There's even a beautiful philosophical approach reflected in the Doom Marine's actions,

17:39.320 --> 17:42.280
where he chooses to wordlessly ignore the information that

17:42.280 --> 17:45.880
Argent Devil Doom Evil Bad Energy can technically be used for good

17:45.880 --> 17:48.360
with only the occasional Nightmare Holocaust.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.880
You must stop.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.640
The Hell Energy is unusable without the filters.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.320
Because it's good to oppose something outright,

17:59.320 --> 18:01.640
even if it can supposedly have positive effects

18:01.640 --> 18:05.240
if you ignore how it's also causing the downfall of civilization.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.400
I hope there's a DLC that's just...

18:07.400 --> 18:10.520
the Doom Marine standing in front of robot Steve Jobs

18:10.520 --> 18:13.640
and just kicking the shit out of the new iPhone just repeatedly.

18:13.640 --> 18:17.240
Entire books have been written about the engine and level design of the first two Dooms,

18:17.240 --> 18:21.000
and entire books will, or at least should, be written about this one.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.080
A glorious new era of action games is waiting to be brought into existence,

18:25.080 --> 18:28.680
and many of the tools for building them are sitting right here.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.960
The one downside—the ONE downside to New Doom

18:31.960 --> 18:35.080
is Bethesda saw its massive success as proof that it's a good idea

18:35.080 --> 18:39.160
to continue to have shitty business practices that promise to only hurt the games industry

18:39.160 --> 18:42.920
and reduce its chances of making those potential good games I just talked about.

18:42.920 --> 18:46.040
Oh yeah, you voted for it on Twitter, and I didn't forget.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.520
I'm just lazy and fat and disgusting.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.880
Next time we're going to look into why Bethesda's policies promise to make it

18:51.880 --> 18:55.480
one of the worst game development companies ever,

18:55.480 --> 18:58.840
long into 2017 and doubtless all the rest of the years,

18:58.840 --> 19:02.600
and not for the regular reason of all the bad games that they keep making.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.400
Thanks for watching. I just ate three walnut whips.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.680
How's your Christmas going?

19:21.320 --> 19:22.680
I've got a whole bunch of plans for next year.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.200
I've got a whole bunch of bonus material I found on a hard drive that I thought was broken

19:26.200 --> 19:27.960
but actually was just not plugged in properly.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.920
I want to finish the Dark Souls 2 apologetics video, which is going pretty well,

19:32.920 --> 19:34.920
but I thought I'd re-record loads of bits of it

19:34.920 --> 19:37.320
because otherwise it's just things I cut out of the Bloodborne video,

19:37.320 --> 19:39.160
and I feel like it needs to be even more cohesive.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.440
I like to pace things properly.

19:41.320 --> 19:50.360
Oh, also, a Swedish bodybuilding Nazi tried to copyright claim one of my videos!

19:50.360 --> 19:52.520
So we might have to talk about that at some point, too.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.320
See ya!

19:58.040 --> 20:05.320
So

20:19.240 --> 20:22.280
I realized that I actually have to bring the camera in with me.
