0	4640	Oh, God, a bunch of people voted for each video, and I can't be bothered to counter them.
5140	6700	Hold on, I'm just gonna flip a coin.
7460	9460	Oh, fuck. Ugh.
10620	13660	It's gone behind my fucking desk.
14320	16980	Fallout 3 is garbage, and here's why.
16980	19520	♪
19520	20420	♪
20420	23900	The first two Fallouts comprise some of the best games ever.
23900	26260	Virtually nothing else comes close.
26260	28440	Okay, let me be more specific.
28440	30280	Three games come close.
30280	32840	Oh, wait, what's this? Ignore this, forget about that.
32840	36840	And all three of them are made by people who worked on Fallout.
36840	40160	And they're also by companies that no longer really exist.
40560	45720	These types of games are very thin on the ground, and don't ever do as well as they deserve to.
46080	50000	I'm gonna talk about what makes the first two Fallout games good a lot in this video,
50000	54200	but it's important to keep in mind that even without comparisons to the previous games,
54200	56760	Fallout 3 fails on its own merits, too.
57160	59160	In an attempt to remain balanced,
59160	63840	I looked up some reviews by more professional reviewers in the business at the time the game came out.
63840	66600	After carefully perusing as many reviews as I can,
66600	69520	I've isolated three key facts about the game.
69520	73000	Fact one, the VATS system looks totally badass.
73000	78440	No written or video review can shy away from mentioning this and showing you in graphic detail.
78440	79720	Yeah!
79720	81080	Yeah!
81080	82560	Woo!
82560	85080	Oh, oh, oh, murder! Woo!
85080	87080	Yee! Woo!
87080	88520	Yee-juh!
88520	89880	Uh-juh...
89880	91880	Mm-mm-mm...
92840	96240	Mm-mm-mm, VATS is still happening.
96240	98480	This is all footage from one review.
98480	100760	They just kept showing it.
100760	102840	This is all there is of Fallout.
102840	105400	This is the part that people like.
105400	107400	What about the nuanced storytelling?
107400	108440	Who gives a shit?
108440	113720	Fact two, there are some audiovisual problems on the PS3 version, which also drops frames quite often.
113720	120280	The jagged edges, washed-out lighting, and slightly diminished draw distance of the PS3 release aren't so easy to dismiss.
120280	123400	We also experienced a number of visual bugs on that platform.
123400	127240	And of course, fact three, game reviewers must be purged.
127240	132600	No, seriously, the IGN review of Fallout 3 talks about how fucking deep and intricate the morality system is
132600	135800	and that doing bad things can have dangerous long-lasting effects.
135800	139480	He says this over footage of his character picking up a fork,
139480	144040	and as all the objects on the table bizarrely float around for no reason,
144040	148120	the entire city begins to shoot him to death for theft.
148120	151240	And the game has an awesome climax that we won't spoil for you here.
151240	154200	The IGN reviewer also thinks the ending was good,
154200	157320	the one thing literally everyone disagrees with.
157320	160200	If you think the ending is good, you're actually wrong.
160200	161080	You don't.
161080	162840	That didn't happen. You hated it.
162840	163720	Shut up.
163720	167080	But no matter which system you own, you should play Fallout 3,
167080	172840	which overcomes its issues by offering a deep and involving journey through a world that's hard to forget.
172840	175960	Kevin, you're calling the game deep and involving over footage of you
175960	179000	friendly-firing your fucking allies for no reason.
179000	180840	That guy shows up to help you.
180840	183560	And I had hoped to assist in your rescue.
183560	186440	And he's attacking him just because.
186440	192040	Taking even the briefest glance at the game criticism industry at the time this game came out
192040	196920	reveals it's just a cavalcade of fucking crazy people who think that
196920	201720	do you want to kill a whole town of people or not is a deep question.
203160	204360	Oh my god.
205320	207720	Game journalism is unethical.
207720	210200	The whole thing is a fucking nightmare mess.
211320	213080	So we have to stop them.
213080	214680	We have to stop this.
214680	217080	How can anyone think this about?
222760	224520	In an attempt to present fairness,
224520	228600	I am going to start by listing out some of the things I liked about Fallout 3.
228600	230840	I'm not against the game being turned into an FPS.
230840	233960	A huge portion of the core engine, even though I'm going to complain about it later,
233960	237640	isn't actually all that bad if you strip away the bad things built on top of it.
237640	240520	Fallout 3 has a solid base in there somewhere.
240520	241400	I like that.
241400	245560	I especially like that you can target the weapon in someone's hands and knock it out.
245560	247240	It's a fun strategic move.
247240	250520	If you ever played Perfect Dark and shot a gun out of someone's hand,
250520	254840	it gave you a rush no other game could provide until Fallout 3 had it, which was neat.
254840	257960	I still wish you could go for the eyes, though, like in the originals.
257960	260440	I also wish the AI wasn't fucking terrible.
262680	265400	I guess the other guy's gonna take cover or maybe duck in and out.
265400	266360	Oh no, here he comes.
270680	274440	I am just holding block with the sword I found on the body next to these people.
275000	277480	I could be wrong, but it looks like the sword is hurting them
277480	279720	as much as it's hurting me when they try punching it.
280760	281800	Stand still!
281800	282680	I am!
282680	285560	Yeah, there are some occasionally funny moments or decent bits
285560	287960	mixed in with the garbage we're getting too soon.
287960	291400	The robot assuring you that the bomb is perfectly safe, we promise,
291400	294840	before you even know there's a bomb is pretty impressive as an opener.
294840	298600	And it's an impressive closer for Megaton, too, if you decide to blow it up.
306360	309640	Also, the sniper guarding the town, who you can't reach without cheats
309640	310920	and seems to know this.
313720	314840	Hey, wait a minute.
314840	317160	Megaton's a little different from up here.
317160	318200	What is this?
318200	318920	Morrowind?
320760	323880	The funniest thing in the game is at Raven Rock, the Enclave base.
323880	326600	You'll notice the mess hall floor is a metal grating.
326600	330840	Well, if you go underneath it, you'll find a ton of knives and forks.
330840	333880	People kept dropping them and losing them down the grating.
334440	335560	That's fucking amazing!
335560	336920	It's spectacular!
336920	342360	It's the single humanizing moment the Enclave get in the entire fucking game,
342360	343640	and I love it.
343640	349080	If Fallout 3 consisted entirely of moments like this, it would be the best game ever made.
349080	350280	There are some characters I like.
350280	351160	Not many.
351160	352360	I like Moira.
352360	355240	She's interesting, quirky, has a personality,
355240	360520	and she's probably the character you can have the most varied relationship with.
360520	364680	By which I mean you can do the quest for her and make her happy.
364680	368360	You can do the quest even better and make her happier.
369240	372120	You can crush her dreams by talking her out of her ideas,
372120	375960	or you can nuke her fucking town and then say hi to her later
375960	378600	and carry on as if it didn't happen.
378600	379640	That's almost depth.
380360	381160	I like, um...
382120	382680	What's his name?
382680	385720	I like General Jing Wei from the Operation Anchorage DLC.
385720	388200	He's an incredibly one-dimensional character,
388840	392040	but he is the one permitted one-dimensional character,
392040	394200	unlike all the others in the rest of the game,
394200	398920	because he's literally a racist caricature in a simulation created by Americans
398920	401880	to train soldiers to want to kill Chinese people.
401880	405960	You can literally convince him in one sentence to commit suicide,
405960	411080	which unfortunately isn't far off from how you talk to real characters in the rest of Fallout 3,
411080	415800	but it's still funny because it reminds you how messed up the creators of the simulation were
415800	419640	and how obsessed they thought the Chinese were with honor.
419640	420520	And also the line,
420520	423640	I'm going to kill you so much is pretty funny.
426680	427320	And, um...
428040	428760	That's not it?
428760	429960	Are those all the characters?
429960	430920	Oh, shit, no, wait!
430920	431880	The medic armor!
431880	435240	The medic armor from the basement of old Olney's sewers.
435240	437080	Listen up, you goddamn puke!
437080	439800	You are now wearing prototype medic power armor!
439800	441800	You take care of me, and I'll take care of you!
442680	447480	That's right, I'm stretching the definition of characters purely to complement a game I don't like.
447480	450040	That's how seriously I take being fair on a game.
450040	454200	The medic armor is similarly a remnant of a messed up period in American history,
454200	458360	and when you put it on, it starts yelling at you like a cartoonish drill sergeant.
458360	461560	But even better, it ruins stealth on purpose.
461560	463160	If you're near an enemy, it speaks.
465800	467320	And this attracts enemies.
467320	469720	It literally makes the game harder.
469720	472520	But it's an interesting piece of world building,
472520	475560	and it manages to say something about the culture that built it,
475560	479480	the obnoxiousness of violent American supremacy or whatever.
479480	481880	And, uh, nope.
482520	483240	Nope.
483240	484040	That's it.
484040	487880	So two characters and one talking piece of apparel are good.
488600	490040	And that's it, everybody!
490040	493880	Don't forget to like, rate, and subscribe before you eat shoots and leaves!
494840	499720	But if you want to take a more critical look at the problems with this game's design,
499720	505480	and perhaps whittle the act of playing video games itself to the bare knob of its meaning,
505480	506360	stay right there.
506920	509240	Let's go on an adventure.
509480	511800	4-3 begins with your character's birth.
512520	515240	The vaginal slit dilates—
515240	516040	That's not what it's called.
516040	516600	Hold on a second.
518280	520520	The cervix dilates, and there we are.
523080	526280	The next hour or so is spent making the character,
526280	528920	picking their stats, and learning the dialogue and VATS systems,
528920	531400	up to the point where it's hard to tell what's going on.
531400	533320	It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.
533320	534120	It's a lot of fun.
534120	534680	It's a lot of fun.
534680	535240	It's a lot of fun.
535240	535880	It's a lot of fun.
535880	536440	It's a lot of fun.
536440	537000	It's a lot of fun.
537000	537560	It's a lot of fun.
537560	538040	It's a lot of fun.
538040	538520	It's a lot of fun.
538520	547320	Let's think about this for a second.
547320	549400	The protagonist's literal birth
549400	551960	is the bad joke answer to the question,
551960	553880	where should our story start?
553880	556680	The other problem with this opening is it's fucking boring!
556680	558920	The stat-picking process takes ages
558920	562120	and corresponds to long scenes of your character growing up,
562120	565240	and nothing major happening and meaningless hijinks
565240	567800	as you learn how to control a first-person video game.
567800	570520	You press the WASD keys to move and use the mouse to—
570520	573640	Are you ready to learn you need to click the mouse to shoot yet?
573640	575720	Sorry, Push Mouse 1?
575720	578760	I dunno, maybe we should fuck around at a birthday party some more.
578760	582360	I genuinely want to know whose idea the opening of the game was.
582360	583640	Give me their name!
583640	586120	The first Bethesda employee to tell me who
586120	588920	came up with the opening sequence set in an enclosed space
588920	590520	you have zero control over
590520	592920	in their action RPG about having freedom
592920	595800	and making meaningful choices gets to live.
595880	597960	But eventually, the game properly starts
597960	600600	and you can finally start acting of your own volition.
600600	603160	Your friend gives you a gun and disappears down the hallway.
603160	605160	And no, that's not a description of how quickly she moves.
605160	606520	She's literally gone.
606520	608840	You grab your stuff and go to follow her.
608840	610360	There he is. Hold it right there!
610360	613560	And it was here, in the first proper room of the game,
613560	616200	that I knew Fallout 3 was going to be a problem.
616200	617880	This is Officer Kendall.
617880	620280	He and all the other cops in the vault beside one
620280	622920	attack you on sight as soon as they see you.
622920	626120	Remember how I just said you can finally act of your own volition?
626120	627240	That was a lie.
627240	629000	You can't initiate dialogue at all.
629000	631640	The roaches that attack him rarely kill him for you.
631640	633720	And once he kills them, he goes hostile on you.
633720	635800	If you try to run away, he'll chase you.
635800	638120	He'll chase you through the entire vault.
638120	641720	He is dedicated to putting his fingers in your eyes.
641720	643480	No, wait, you can't target those anymore.
643480	644440	Your head, then.
645080	645800	Whatever.
645800	647480	You can talk to Budge,
647480	650200	the fucker who's been bullying you your entire life.
650200	652200	In fact, you have no choice not to.
652200	655240	He will chase you down to tell you about his mother.
655240	656520	You gotta help me!
656520	658280	But you can't speak to this guy,
658280	661320	who's been a law-abiding citizen and a nice guy vault cop,
661320	663640	who attended your birthday party.
663640	665640	Butch, fucking Butch,
665640	668760	is allowed to have depth and be treated with a range of options.
668760	670360	You can help him save his mother,
670360	672920	leave her to her fate, or murder him in the head.
672920	675640	This is the closest the game comes to a series of choices,
675640	678840	but the game literally forces you to encounter that choice.
678840	682440	And meanwhile, you don't even get one whatsoever when it comes to Officer Mac.
682440	684760	Is this what Fallout is supposed to be?
684760	686760	A hallway with enemies to shoot?
686760	689080	That sounds fine for your bog standard action game,
689080	693480	but isn't this supposed to be about having the freedom to choose what sort of person you are?
693480	696840	Because now, no matter what sort of person I turn out to be,
696840	699800	I've already shot a man's fucking head off his body!
699800	702520	Officer Kendall isn't the victim of the Lone Wanderer.
702520	704120	He's a victim of bad writing.
704920	709640	Compare and contrast with your first meeting with a hostile human in, say, Fallout 2.
709640	713480	To continue in your quest, you must defeat me in unarmed combat.
713480	715080	Why do we have to fight?
715080	718840	The path of the Chosen One is not an easy trail to walk, H-Bomb.
718840	721400	This challenge prepares you to face another human,
721400	722760	look him in the eyes,
722760	724920	and know that you may have to kill him.
724920	726120	I disagree with you.
726120	728920	I think that a peaceful solution to any problem is possible.
730760	733000	Yeah, see you in shit, police officer!
733080	735960	I literally couldn't even attempt a conversation with.
735960	740440	Say hi to your family at your crappy state funeral I had no choice not to cause.
740440	745000	Oh, and it'll be closed, casket, because this is how firearms work!
745000	747720	Officer Park is intestines now!
748280	751400	A lot of games make a big deal out of player choice,
751400	756520	but few in recent memory offer so many intricate ways of approaching any given situation.
756520	757960	There are so many options.
758680	759180	Gun.
762280	762780	Bat.
763560	764060	Oh!
766360	767400	Oh! Knife!
769960	773480	Having a conversation with the human beings in front of you with thoughts and dreams and-
778280	782360	It's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and replaying.
783480	783980	Okay?
784940	787340	Hello, darkness, my old friend.
789500	791900	I've come to talk with you again.
793900	797420	If you aren't Butch, this one guard, or the Overseer,
797420	802060	your only meaningful choice is picking which weapon you mash them to death with.
802060	804460	They're treated like the radroaches!
804460	807420	Like I said, the problem with Fallout 3 isn't any one issue.
807420	811660	Having a long sequence where you play as a baby and pick your stats from little books is fine,
811660	815100	but it's this in tandem with the several other long sequences,
815100	817260	the being told how to click a mouse,
817260	820940	the escape sequence where most players unavoidably killed a bunch of cops
820940	824700	because they weren't given any other choices in this game about having freedom of choice.
824700	827100	The character you build is garbage, too!
827100	829260	They took out all the nuance from it.
829260	832540	They took out the trait system, because traits are scary.
832540	833980	For those of you who don't know,
833980	837900	traits in the first two games are special choices with positive and negative downsides,
837900	840860	which you can start the game with that radically alter the game,
840860	845740	like Jinx, which increases the amount of critical failures everyone, including you, can get,
845740	849100	making the game a hilarious mess of constant suffering!
849100	851180	It's how I make almost every character nowadays,
851180	854220	and it adds yet another layer of possibilities to the proceedings,
854220	856860	as enemies and allies blow the weapons out of their hands
856860	861660	and your dog does such a bad job of biting someone that his leg spontaneously breaks!
861660	864540	But who'd want to risk having funny things happen at random,
864540	869100	or cool risk-reward builds for characters who want to specialize in certain types of skills?
869100	870460	That sounds too fun!
870460	872780	And like it would add too much variety,
872780	875260	that would run the risk of making the vault escape sequence
875260	877500	even a little different every time you do it.
878140	884940	And it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and replaying.
884940	886940	Worth playing and replaying, eh, Kevin?
886940	888460	Hmm, I wonder if players agree with you—
888460	891020	No, wait! They modded the opening out!
891020	891980	That's right!
891980	896060	Even players who loved Fallout 3 enough to learn how to make mods for it
896060	899420	think this opening is a heaping pile of garbage trash!
899420	903820	When the game's biggest fans are editing the content out of a game,
903820	905980	that content is probably bad!
905980	908380	Maybe it's wrong of me to harp on the opening so much,
908380	909820	because even at its worst,
909820	912780	it's an hour of boring, repetitive stuff of no consequence,
912780	913980	and then you're done with it.
913980	916140	But it's not that simple, is it?
916140	918860	The sort of people who thought this was an acceptable way
918860	921260	to open their game about freedom and choice
921260	922940	made the rest of the game, too!
922940	925020	Whoever it was whose fault is the opening,
925020	929020	you can see their grubby little piss-stained hands all over the entire game.
929020	931180	So it's worth talking about the opening's problems
931180	933980	because they're a microcosm of Fallout 3 as a whole.
933980	936140	The dad making all the real decisions,
936140	937900	who you're just following around,
937900	941180	and the throwaway characters you won't have any interest in seeing again
941180	944460	all prime you expertly for the shitty game to come.
944460	946460	So if you can call 3's opening anything,
947100	949660	one word you could call it is honest.
949660	951340	Another word would be shite-arse.
952220	954220	Fallout 3's engine is fairly solid,
954220	956700	but its design is terrible!
956700	959740	Now, I know the lockpicking and hacking minigames are often criticized,
959740	961340	but to be honest, I'm okay with them.
961340	962620	But like the rest of Fallout 3,
962620	965660	their potential is squandered because they aren't used well.
966220	969820	Hacking and lockpicking should be a skill your character has to bother to develop,
969820	972300	which is then rewarded in the form of extra loot,
972300	974060	or the ability to alter a situation,
974060	976060	or even bypass a trickier fight.
976060	977820	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
978620	981580	But let's look at their actual use in the opening.
981580	983500	To access the Overseer's chamber,
983500	987100	you could pick the very easy, almost impossible-to-fail lock,
987100	991180	or you could open the dresser drawer one room away and take the key.
991180	993020	To access the Overseer's computer,
993020	995100	you could do the hacking minigame,
995100	998540	or you could open the drawer directly next to the computer
998540	1000380	and obtain the password directly.
1000380	1003900	While this is probably done to teach the player that hacking and lockpicking are useful,
1003900	1006620	but can sometimes be circumvented by resource-worn games,
1006620	1009580	circumvented by resourcefulness and being aware of your environment,
1009580	1013580	they impart the far stupider lesson that hacking and lockpicking is pointless,
1013580	1016060	and you'll be able to skip them incredibly easily.
1016060	1019900	So, players are ingrained with the belief that these minigames can be avoided,
1019900	1021980	and you ought to look for ways to do so.
1021980	1024220	I think that's why people criticize them so much.
1024220	1025820	Not because they're directly bad,
1025820	1030140	but because the game itself teaches you that you should avoid doing them if you can.
1030140	1032060	Even when you do get out of the vault,
1032060	1035100	Fallout 3's wasteland is big and very pretty at times,
1035100	1039340	but fails to feel like a world because of some very bad design decisions.
1039340	1043340	You're simultaneously too free and have no choices.
1043340	1046540	I know that doesn't make any sense, but we'll get to it, okay? Trust me.
1046540	1047900	The world is really open.
1047900	1051180	You can, technically, go anywhere in the world immediately.
1051180	1053820	The developers seem to have actively wanted this to be the case,
1053820	1055820	so they designed the world around this.
1055820	1059100	Consequently, all the areas feel roughly the same.
1059100	1062620	An open-world shooter can be structured well, like Stalker,
1062700	1065580	which, for example, put harder and stronger enemies in later areas
1065580	1068940	because you've become better at playing and found better equipment.
1068940	1073340	The world is designed so, while you can technically come to harder areas very quickly,
1073340	1078060	simply getting there requires skills or weaponry you will get your hands on on the way over.
1078060	1082460	No matter how you play Stalker, the game is arranged so that if you're playing properly,
1082460	1085500	you're never in a position where you're at a tremendous disadvantage,
1085500	1088940	and more difficult areas are discouraged by being harder to do early on,
1088940	1090940	while still being technically doable.
1091020	1094700	You can assault the army base right next to the start of the game straight away,
1094700	1097180	but you have to be really good to be able to do it.
1097180	1100300	This creates a sense of friction and challenge and fun
1100300	1102620	where the player's ability is being tested.
1102620	1105420	Assaulting the army base in Stalker is just great.
1105420	1106220	I love it.
1106220	1108060	And it's—it's—it's—
1108060	1109740	AAAAAAHHHHHHHH
1109740	1113020	Players don't usually think about these elements of games, especially shooters,
1113020	1117260	but the design of the progression and the pacing is what makes a game fun.
1117260	1121820	Fallout 3's world is designed for almost every area to be accessible to anyone at any time.
1121820	1125980	This means that the developers had to avoid making an area the player could go too early,
1125980	1129900	which let me remind you is anywhere, too hard, so most—
1129900	1135180	no, let's be honest, all enemies and characters in the game have fairly low-quality equipment and stats,
1135180	1139820	and no lockpicks or hacking minigames in your path require much skill to activate.
1139820	1143980	This practically eliminates any sense of pace or rising action or difficulty.
1143980	1147820	Once you've dealt with a couple of packs of raiders and leveled up just a little,
1147820	1150940	or if you stopped off at Moira's for the rocket launcher early on,
1150940	1155260	90% of the game is a splashy meat fest where nothing could really challenge you,
1155260	1157740	rendering almost the entire game dull.
1157740	1159980	A good game is like a three-course meal.
1159980	1163180	You have your salad, your main, and your dessert.
1163180	1165420	Fallout 3 is one massive salad,
1165420	1170700	and you only need to have a little bit of salad before you wish the waiter would bring you your fucking spaghetti!
1170700	1175020	A ton of popular gameplay mods for Fallout 3 make the game harder in various ways,
1175020	1177660	with more realistic weapon damage, or harder enemies,
1177660	1180780	or adding more mechanics the player has to deal with to survive,
1180780	1182380	and this is because past a certain point,
1182380	1185900	you're gonna need that stuff for the game to be challenging in the slightest.
1185900	1189820	Once again, modders are having to do the developers' jobs for them.
1189820	1192940	The most popular of these, Fallout 3 Wanderer's Edition,
1192940	1195420	also adds the ability to skip the opening,
1195420	1197420	because of course it would!
1197420	1200940	Whoever designed this mod should have made Fallout 3!
1200940	1203980	The place where you should be able to expect the enemies and their skills,
1203980	1207020	weapons, and armor to really get more difficult is the main story,
1207020	1210140	but the developers had no way of knowing what level the player would be
1210140	1211500	when they were doing the main story,
1211500	1213580	and wanted to make sure players didn't get stuck,
1213580	1215180	so once the Enclave turn up,
1215180	1218380	not only do they engage you in small enough numbers that they're not a problem,
1218380	1219900	even at quite a low level,
1219900	1222860	but once you encounter them in greater numbers close to the climax,
1222860	1225660	there's invariably something else shooting at them for you,
1225660	1228140	like Liberty Prime, or the Brotherhood of Steel,
1228140	1230860	or Forks, or the turrets in the Enclave base.
1230860	1233420	So even the hard enemies aren't hard.
1234140	1237340	Well, at least the robots are having a fun combat experience here.
1241900	1244940	It's possible to beat a huge portion of the larger set pieces
1244940	1246380	without firing a single shot,
1246380	1248700	because your allies are invincible and overpowered
1248700	1250780	in order to make sure the plot gets pushed forward.
1250780	1252300	In fact, in the final mission,
1252300	1253980	if you're a melee weapons character,
1253980	1256540	the real challenge is to kill anyone yourself,
1256540	1259500	so you're totally free to take part in the game's story,
1259500	1263740	but don't ever have any influence over it in terms of story or gameplay.
1264140	1267740	So in other words, you're too free and have no choices.
1267740	1269740	Do you get it? It all made sense.
1270060	1272780	There are a couple of areas that are suddenly very difficult.
1272780	1276780	For example, the old Olney Sewers I mentioned before are a nightmare mess.
1276780	1278700	The deathclaws are really powerful,
1278700	1281580	making the area the most challenging one in the entire game,
1281580	1284300	and literally impossible if you went to it early on.
1284300	1286700	The reward is a suit of power armor that's no better
1286700	1288940	than the armor you'd need to be wearing to get to it,
1288940	1290700	which, by the way, is still overpowered
1290700	1293180	for the entirety of the rest of Fallout 3's world.
1293180	1294780	If you're gonna have an area like this,
1294780	1297500	you should probably put it somewhere only late-game players can get to
1297500	1299100	so they don't get murdered over and over
1299100	1301020	expecting it to be like the rest of the game,
1301020	1303100	but no, it's just sitting there.
1303100	1306140	Worse off, it's not even leveled to the areas around it.
1306140	1309900	Right next to it, further away from where you start the game,
1309900	1311500	is the Republic of Dave,
1311740	1315260	It's a fun little area with its own, like, weird democracy thing going on,
1315260	1316860	but there's only five characters in it.
1316860	1318140	It's really fun.
1318140	1320060	The Republic of Dave is, like Olney,
1320060	1322780	one of the few truly cool areas in the game,
1322780	1326220	but they're the two areas that shouldn't be right next to each other!
1326220	1328780	They should be on opposite sides of the map!
1328780	1331180	These areas are two of my three favorites in the game,
1331180	1335100	and they're both shoved off to the side right next to each other like an afterthought.
1335100	1337580	A game that properly paced itself would arrange its map
1337580	1339900	so you encountered the latter very early on,
1339900	1342060	and the former much, much later,
1342060	1344140	when, in fact, the opposite happens.
1344140	1346300	Speaking of badly thought-out gameplay,
1346300	1348460	thanks to the poor visual design and writing,
1348460	1350940	it's often very difficult to know how to get somewhere
1350940	1352380	once you decide where you want to go,
1352380	1355260	or what exactly to do when you're doing a quest.
1355260	1357340	The world is so big and full of junk that,
1357340	1360140	for most of the game, if you're doing a story or optional quest,
1360140	1363020	you can't rely on the game to tell you where to head visually.
1363020	1365340	You have to look at the arrow on your radar.
1365340	1371020	And down here is the biggest travesty in the history of video games.
1371020	1373180	Okay, it's not that bad, but it's pretty bad.
1373180	1377580	A good game can tell you where to go effortlessly through the design of its levels,
1377580	1381500	or by giving you enough directions that you can put the pieces together yourself.
1381500	1384860	This is good because it encourages the player to be aware of their surroundings,
1384860	1387820	which lets them fully appreciate the worlds the designers have built
1387820	1389820	and all the neat personal touches to it.
1389820	1392780	When you build a world centered around giving them a blip on their radar
1392780	1394780	to walk towards in a straight line,
1394780	1397820	you hamstring not just their own sense of going on their own journey
1397820	1399820	and making their own decisions,
1399820	1404140	but you've created a situation where the game is teaching you to follow this with your brain.
1404140	1408700	Your eyes are trained to follow it, to stare at it, to just go where it tells you to.
1408700	1412460	The levels can be often quite nice-looking, with fun little things to look at,
1412460	1415100	but your eyes are here at all times.
1415100	1417260	You probably didn't even notice you were doing it,
1417260	1420140	but the game's objective marker slowly turns you into an idiot
1420140	1422220	with no awareness of your surroundings.
1422220	1424220	Here's a review from 2014.
1424380	1427420	Also, like, stuff like, you thought Liberty Prime was sick.
1427420	1430140	I thought it was awesome because he was there the whole time
1430140	1431660	and you never paid attention to him.
1431660	1435020	Liberty Prime is a gigantic fucking robot!
1435020	1437180	You have a bunch of opportunities to see it.
1437180	1440780	You cannot avoid seeing it when you walk into the room!
1440780	1443260	It is literally impossible!
1443260	1446140	And yet, somehow, these players missed it
1446140	1450140	until it was the thing you were following for the last quest as it did all the work.
1450140	1453020	I'm not calling these guys stupid, they're pretty funny and smart.
1453020	1456220	I'm saying Fallout 3 is so stupid by design
1456220	1460540	that it teaches players not to notice things that are otherwise quite easy just to look at
1460540	1463740	and see with your human eyes!
1463740	1466700	In previous Fallouts, if you don't have your wits about you,
1466700	1468700	you're not gonna see what you need to see.
1468700	1471260	It trained you to develop an awareness of your surroundings,
1471260	1475260	and thus, A, make you feel awesome when you figure out a way of doing things
1475260	1478540	that wasn't obvious or literally just told to you by the game,
1478540	1480780	it made you feel like you'd solved a puzzle,
1480780	1484380	and B, it gave you an appreciation of the design of the world.
1484380	1487420	Remember the forks under the mess hall in the Enclave base?
1487420	1490780	How many players do you think noticed that or realized why?
1490780	1494780	This is an uncharacteristically cool and funny and human piece of world-building,
1494780	1498380	but the game was seemingly designed around making sure you don't see it
1498380	1500220	because you're too busy looking at this,
1500220	1502700	the one thing telling you where you're supposed to go.
1502700	1505420	I remember in the other Fallout games and Planescape Torment
1505420	1507580	getting given strict directions like
1507580	1510540	go down the street and take the second left to get to my friend's house.
1510540	1512300	You have to navigate a street.
1512300	1513740	At one point in Fallout 2,
1513740	1515980	a guy gives you directions to some buried treasure,
1515980	1516940	and guess what?
1516940	1518220	He lies.
1518220	1521340	You have to navigate the world based on some guy's advice,
1521340	1523180	which might not even be honest.
1523180	1526140	There wasn't an arrow constantly pointing at your destination.
1526140	1530460	Conversely, turning this arrow off would render many quests impossible
1530460	1534220	because figuring out what you have to do and where without this guide
1534220	1536860	just isn't something the game is equipped to do.
1536860	1538700	In order to progress the main story,
1538700	1541100	you have to pick up this tape.
1541100	1544300	So without the arrow pointing you directly to it,
1544300	1545740	how would you ever find it?
1545740	1547420	It's in a giant base.
1547420	1550620	The Elder Scrolls games, also by Bethesda, have this problem too,
1550620	1552940	and worst off, Morrowind, the ancient one,
1552940	1554780	is the one that doesn't have this problem.
1554780	1556780	The game left navigation to the player,
1556780	1558700	and it resulted in a better world.
1558700	1561500	I haven't finished any of the last three Elder Scrolls games,
1561500	1563180	but I stuck with Morrowind the longest
1563180	1565500	because it felt like my adventure,
1565500	1567980	not an adventure someone else wrote for me,
1568060	1571020	and certainly not an adventure someone else wrote for a different character
1571020	1572860	that I'm just sort of there for.
1572860	1575900	One area of the main story, Vault 87,
1575900	1577740	doesn't give you a place to go.
1577740	1580780	You have to look around a big facility to find the GECK,
1580780	1581740	and guess what?
1581740	1584860	It's by far one of the most interesting areas of the game
1584860	1587740	because it had to be designed to lead you where you should look
1587740	1589100	through sheer design
1589100	1592460	instead of offering very little in terms of direction or world building
1592460	1595100	and relying on a heads-up display with an arrow on it.
1595100	1597820	This forces you to become more aware of your surroundings
1597820	1600060	and causes you to appreciate the game more.
1600060	1601500	It's a breath of fresh air.
1601500	1602700	You notice little things,
1602700	1606380	like how the mutants keep a leaf blower on the shelf next to the meat.
1606380	1607820	That's not sanitary.
1607820	1609260	Meanwhile, in the rest of the game,
1609260	1612140	players don't notice the giant fucking robot
1612140	1614940	because they're too busy following arrows to objectives.
1614940	1619180	Vault 87 is like an intrusion from an alternate reality version of Fallout 3
1619180	1621100	that was really, really good.
1621100	1624780	It's also the one place in the game where you can actually talk to a mutant.
1624780	1626860	Imagine if you could do that with more of them.
1626860	1628380	But it's not just the way you're led around
1628380	1630780	or the poor visual design of the world, no.
1630780	1633180	Fallout 3 is geometrically wrong,
1633180	1634540	and we're gonna show our working.
1634540	1635980	Have you packed your protractor?
1635980	1637980	Because I didn't, can I borrow yours?
1637980	1641980	In open-world games, players can theoretically go anywhere right away,
1641980	1644300	but designers, at least decent ones,
1644300	1646220	do their best to set out a path
1646220	1648620	and give you a sense of direction and progression.
1648620	1650620	This applies also to side quests.
1650620	1653980	While optional content that doesn't affect the main story is fine,
1654060	1657260	there are good and bad ways to put this stuff into the player's view.
1657260	1659660	In Fallout 1, when you're looking for the water chip,
1659660	1662140	you start off with literally one thing on your map,
1662140	1663180	just like in 3.
1663180	1666700	We marked your map with the location of another vault.
1666700	1668860	Not a bad place to start, I think.
1668860	1670620	So, you head in this direction.
1671980	1673420	But what's this?
1673420	1674060	That's right.
1674060	1677660	On your direct path to your objective is Shady Sands,
1677660	1679500	the first populated area.
1679500	1680940	Do you see what the game's done here?
1680940	1683020	The game has given you one place to go,
1683020	1685900	but on your direct route, it's offered you another one.
1685900	1687260	You could go wherever you want,
1687260	1689420	wander around, prance off into the wastes.
1689420	1693660	In fact, you could go to one of the last areas in the game by just walking left.
1693660	1696140	But with just this one location,
1696140	1698540	you've actually been shown two places to go.
1698540	1701580	On top of that, you actually can't get into the vault without a rope.
1701580	1704620	Luckily, you now know of somewhere where you might find one.
1704620	1707180	No objective marker needs to pop up to let you
1707180	1711020	know you need to find a rope with an arrow floating over the people who can sell you one.
1711020	1713340	You go there, you see you need one,
1713340	1715180	and then it's up to you to find it.
1715820	1719500	This establishes a very important narrative and thematic throughline.
1719500	1721900	You're told to do something or go somewhere,
1721900	1724220	but doing that isn't so straightforward.
1724220	1726460	You have to be resourceful to make things work.
1726460	1727740	The game is saying,
1727740	1730380	what you have to do is not going to be obvious.
1730380	1731580	Use your head.
1731580	1733020	This is capped off by how,
1733020	1736700	once you do get a rope and descend to the bottom of Vault 15,
1736700	1739180	you find the lower levels have been completely destroyed,
1739180	1741340	and you're going to have to search elsewhere.
1741340	1745260	So the only instruction you've been given leads to a dead end.
1745260	1749020	None of the people in Shady Sands have probably ever seen a computer in their lives.
1749020	1751740	You have to find your own leads from here on out.
1751740	1753340	The game doesn't hold your hand,
1753340	1758220	but it nudges useful options into your path for you to work with as you see fit.
1758220	1759420	Now it's just you,
1759420	1760300	the wasteland,
1760300	1762300	and, hopefully, somewhere,
1762300	1763100	a water chip.
1763660	1766700	Finding out where one is and figuring out how to get it
1766700	1769580	forms the basis of the entire first half of the game.
1769580	1772700	It's a free-form journey you venture on yourself.
1772700	1774860	Compare and contrast with the search for your dad,
1774860	1777900	where there's always an objective marker pointing to your next breadcrumb,
1777900	1779420	which will tell you where to go next,
1779420	1781020	marked on your radar, of course,
1781020	1782140	until you find him.
1782140	1784860	There's no actual adventuring for the player to do.
1784860	1788780	I think this is why a lot of players ignore the story for a lot of their time playing the game.
1788780	1793100	The story is so unengaging and requires so little effort or thought on your part
1793100	1795340	that your brain sort of slides off it,
1795420	1798700	and you go off to mess about with Tenpenny Tower or those vampire guys,
1798700	1801420	or just wander around listening to the radio.
1801420	1804620	Fallout 1 always makes you feel like you're the hero on a journey
1804620	1808140	by straightforwardly putting the onus on the player to connect the dots
1808140	1812060	while handing you places to look in an order of increasing complexity and danger
1812060	1814940	based on where players are most likely to go next in their mission.
1814940	1818140	It's free-form, and yet it's also subtly structured.
1818140	1820140	You're always searching for the water chip,
1820140	1824620	always on your guard for someone who might happen to be able to help put some pieces of the puzzle together,
1824620	1827660	and when side quests happen, they're also engaging,
1827660	1830780	and they're introduced in an organic, entertaining way.
1830780	1833180	For example, after you've discovered Vault 15's wrecked,
1833180	1835660	you remember a guy you talked to mentioning trade caravans
1835660	1838460	that carry water to and from several towns and cities.
1838460	1839820	So you check out Junk Town.
1839820	1843420	On the way into the town proper, you hear this guy called Killian is the town's sheriff,
1843420	1847260	and there's a dude called Gizmo who runs a casino and does crime things.
1847260	1850460	I go see Killian, who is like a shopkeeper as well as a sheriff,
1850460	1852700	which is a little weird and control-y,
1852780	1854300	but he seems nice enough.
1857020	1858540	Oh, I think I already have.
1858540	1860700	While he doesn't know anything about the chip or vaults
1860700	1865020	and actively gets annoyed by vault dwellers who live lives of safety and complacency,
1865020	1869020	he seems like a nice person and has stuff to sell that can help you out.
1869020	1871020	Then a guy comes in and tries to murder him.
1871020	1872780	Holy shi- I'm right here!
1872780	1874860	I've looked into his dreamy eyes!
1874860	1876140	You can't do that!
1876140	1877500	Obviously you help out.
1879820	1880860	Then Killian's like,
1880860	1882300	we know Gizmo's behind this,
1882300	1885500	but we're Law & Order-type guys, so we have to follow procedure.
1885500	1888220	Next thing you know, you're wiretapping Gizmo's office
1888220	1892060	or getting him to confess to wanting to murder Killian into a tape recorder.
1892060	1895180	So, will you do it for me?
1895180	1897020	Oh yeah, I sure will.
1897740	1900140	Wait, do you see what the game's done?
1900140	1903420	You've reached a point where you're pulling classic cop show hijinks,
1903420	1908540	and it all happened completely organically from walking into a store to ask about the water chip.
1908540	1909740	It's badass!
1909740	1912700	And the side quest is not only entertaining and fun side content,
1912700	1915100	but despite being technically totally optional,
1915100	1918780	the game almost forces you to get involved from how it introduces it to you.
1918780	1922940	There isn't just an optional dialogue choice where you ask Killian if he has any side quests,
1922940	1927500	and he's like, yeah, maybe go to a place and shoot some guys and bring me back a MacGuffin.
1927500	1932060	You get involved with the story of this town simply in the process of walking into it.
1932060	1936780	Junk Town and Junk Town's completely optional additions to the game are peak game design
1936780	1939340	because they present themselves to you naturally.
1939340	1942860	Fallout, despite being made in the 90s before games went mainstream
1942860	1945260	and simplified themselves for a wider audience,
1945260	1947980	is incredibly good at getting people into it.
1947980	1950860	That's why it's so beloved by so many people.
1950860	1953500	Let's contrast with the first town in Fallout 3.
1953500	1956780	You go to Megaton because your game's objective marker tells you to.
1956780	1958220	You walk into a bar and a man says,
1958220	1960860	I knew your dad and I'll tell you where to go if you do a thing for me.
1960860	1963980	But if you hack his computer or talk to his employee for five seconds,
1963980	1965580	you don't need to do that at all.
1965580	1968380	The most freedom you have in your journey to see your dad
1968380	1972060	is how much pointless busywork for other people you have to do.
1972060	1976460	Instead of the options put in your path being different rewards for different actions,
1976460	1979580	most of the rewards are how much side content you want to skip.
1979580	1982140	After that, you go to Galaxy News Radio and see Three Dog
1982140	1984140	because that's what the objective marker says,
1984140	1986620	and then eventually Three Dog tells you he knows where your dad went.
1986620	1989020	But first, would you like to do an optional quest for me?
1989900	1991900	No? Okay, well, he went to Rivet City.
1991900	1994060	All right, so you go to Rivet City.
1994060	1995420	They say he went somewhere else.
1995420	1997020	You go there, you clear out the mutants there,
1997020	1998140	your objective marker tells you—
1998140	1999980	If you are worried about the story, don't be.
1999980	2001580	It's very well-structured and focused.
2001580	2002940	And then you go there and blah blah blah,
2002940	2005580	you're still following this one fucking guy's trail.
2005580	2010060	Which brings me to the game's biggest single narrative and gameplay problem.
2010060	2013020	The main character is never the main character.
2013020	2015180	Your dad is the main character for most of it,
2015180	2017100	doing his own thing for his own reasons.
2017100	2019020	All the game's truly big decisions—
2019020	2021740	the decision to abandon his life's work and raise his son,
2021740	2023580	the decision to leave and try again,
2023580	2026940	the decision to kill himself in order to prevent the Enclave from taking over—
2026940	2031500	you spend too much of this game watching your dad have a much more intricate story.
2031500	2033980	So, uh, I'm Warsaw here.
2033980	2034540	It's time.
2034540	2035900	God damn it, Janice!
2035900	2039340	What did I tell you about walking to tables in the middle of a fucking cutscene?
2039340	2041420	The real main characters are talking here!
2041420	2043020	But even when your dad dies,
2043020	2046700	you're not left to pick up the pieces and make things work for yourself.
2046700	2048540	Dr. Li immediately takes over
2048540	2050780	and starts giving you the orders for where to go next.
2050780	2052380	We've got to evacuate now.
2052380	2054380	Don't wander off. We're going to need you.
2054380	2056060	Jeez, Madison, you don't have to be rude.
2056060	2057500	I'm standing right here.
2057500	2058700	This guy knows what's up.
2059260	2061020	Or he knows something.
2062140	2062940	Are you all right?
2063500	2064000	Mate?
2064620	2066780	Hello, darkness, my old friend.
2068060	2070140	Here she is convincing the Brotherhood to let you in.
2070940	2071740	Lions!
2071740	2072780	I know you're in there!
2072780	2073740	I know you can hear me!
2073740	2075820	You open this goddamn door right now!
2075820	2077260	I guess I'm also here.
2077260	2078620	I'm—I'm the player, but we—
2079500	2081820	And then, when the time finally comes
2081820	2084300	to take back the memorial and kick the Enclave out,
2084300	2086940	who gives the triumphant speeches and leads the charge?
2086940	2087900	Not you!
2087900	2088940	When we're done with this,
2088940	2091740	everyone can have a nice cold glass of water on me.
2091740	2092860	Pry, move out!
2093500	2094860	Hey, guys, how's it going?
2094860	2096220	I literally can't even move.
2096220	2099660	I have to watch this play out exactly how the developers want it to.
2099660	2102620	The biggest effect you can have on the final mission is
2102620	2104620	if you bring an ally in with you,
2104620	2108140	Lions can't get past them when it takes longer for them to get out of the room.
2108140	2110060	The final mission is you walking in a straight line,
2110060	2112620	assisted by the Brotherhood as they kill everyone for you,
2112620	2115500	and you're all following a robot as he kills everyone else.
2115500	2118860	I spent a huge portion of this mission trying to score kills of my own,
2118860	2120380	and I think I got about three.
2120940	2123180	Oh, come on, guys, no kill-stealing.
2123180	2124540	That's just rude.
2124540	2128940	So, apart from a few brief flashes of brilliance like Vault 87,
2128940	2133260	the entire main story the developers wrote for their game is total garbo,
2133260	2135660	and barely even actually qualifies as a story.
2135740	2139820	You're basically a camera with legs who watches a story happen at you.
2139820	2144140	This makes the player constantly aware that they aren't really taking part in a story.
2144780	2146620	They're just playing a video game.
2146620	2149100	Like, I can already imagine an angry comment saying,
2149100	2152460	He's complaining that people are treating the game like a game, lol!
2152460	2154060	But bear with me here.
2154060	2156060	Games, especially role-playing games,
2156060	2159260	are focused on creating a sense of not simply being in a game,
2159260	2162140	but of being immersed in an interactive story.
2162140	2166140	They're emergent from tabletop games like D&D, or in Fallout's case, GURPS.
2166140	2170220	If someone invited you to their weekly sessions set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland,
2170220	2173500	and the story was not only weirdly railroady where your character's dad,
2173500	2175900	who was immortal until his heroic sacrifice,
2175900	2179100	and some lady in power armor and her pals did all the real work,
2179100	2181420	and the only way to interact with the other stories in the world
2181420	2185180	is to ask where the side quests are because you aren't introduced to them organically,
2185180	2187900	you're not really going to be having a good time, are you?
2187900	2190060	Core concept? Bottom line?
2190060	2195420	Fallout 3 fails as an RPG because it fails to make you feel like a person in a world.
2195420	2197340	What does Fallout 3 have to make up for it?
2197340	2199340	Well, that's easy. The rocket launcher.
2201020	2203820	This weapon was touted hugely before it came out.
2203820	2206300	A physics gun that shoots stuff at people.
2206300	2207180	How fun!
2207180	2208780	I'm not saying the rocket launcher's bad.
2208780	2211420	It's not an inherently stupid thing to add to a game,
2211420	2215740	but is it the sort of thing you should be adding to your game before the writing,
2215740	2217820	or storytelling, or game design?
2217820	2219500	One last big design problem.
2219500	2221660	Speech as a concept.
2221660	2223980	Fallout 3 broke it.
2223980	2228460	In the first two games, dialogue had a lot of sneaky behind-the-scenes stuff going on.
2228460	2230700	If your character wasn't smart enough to know something,
2230700	2232940	you couldn't say it in a conversation,
2232940	2235180	and even then, if you didn't have high enough speech,
2235180	2237900	the smarter, more convincing options weren't available.
2237900	2240140	You didn't even see you could make them,
2240140	2244140	and when they were available, you had to actively choose them yourself.
2244140	2245660	You were shown a list of options,
2245660	2247980	and it was up to you to discern what the best,
2247980	2251500	most persuasive thing to say might be to the character in question.
2251500	2254140	It was subtle, and awesome.
2254140	2257100	As always, Fallout 3 ruined everything.
2257100	2260220	For one thing, they're always openly visible to any player.
2260220	2262380	No longer is having high speech a nice surprise
2262380	2265740	that either causes a cool new option to open up and surprise you,
2265740	2269100	or a backing thing adding to your list of possible options.
2269100	2271500	The high speech options are always just sitting there,
2271500	2274060	unsubtle as a gun that shoots junk.
2274060	2276940	Furthermore, it's not a simple test of your character's skill levels,
2276940	2279420	or player ability to decide the best answer,
2279420	2282620	but rather a percentage dice roll based on your skill.
2282620	2284620	It even tells you the percentage,
2284620	2287420	so you can specialize in speech but not roll properly,
2287420	2289980	or someone else who didn't bother gets lucky with it,
2289980	2291820	or you can just reload over and over,
2291820	2295740	which completely defeats the point of having speech checks at all.
2295740	2299420	Cumulatively, this is a huge problem for the game as a whole.
2299420	2302300	Conversation is the fundamental medium
2302300	2305100	through which you experience the Fallout universe,
2305100	2307580	and the speech ability is perhaps the most useful
2307580	2310700	and unique thing Fallout ever brought to the table.
2310700	2314780	Messing this up this badly is a GAME CRIME.
2314780	2316860	Even without relating to the previous games,
2316860	2319100	it makes this world feel like it's made of tissue paper,
2319100	2321020	where if I pass a dice roll,
2321020	2323180	I can totally alter a person's worldview.
2323180	2325340	It's unsubtle and completely ill-fitting
2325340	2327340	for a game series ostensibly based around
2327340	2329900	the nuanced frictions between people.
2329900	2332540	Now let's talk briefly about the weapon degradation system.
2333420	2334060	It's bad.
2336300	2338540	No, wait, that's not fair. I'll explain why.
2338540	2340540	Okay, so I can see what they're going for.
2340540	2343580	There's quite a good deal of thought going into the system and their execution,
2343580	2345580	but like with the way the main quest plays out
2345580	2348060	and the general landmarkless look of the Wasteland,
2348060	2350060	it isn't quite done right.
2350060	2353500	The idea is that your weapons are old and breaking and need to be repaired,
2353500	2354860	not just to continue working,
2354860	2357020	but because their condition affects their damage.
2357100	2360300	A fully functioning pistol is better than one that's falling apart.
2360300	2362780	You have a repair stat that allows you to take two of a weapon
2362780	2364860	and turn them into one better weapon,
2364860	2366380	but you need to get your stat higher
2366380	2368860	to get things beyond a certain quality threshold.
2368860	2370860	This means that as your character progresses,
2370860	2373820	you don't just get stronger by having more points in guns,
2373820	2376140	but you also end up with higher quality weapons
2376140	2378380	that improve your damage output even further.
2378380	2379980	This, so far, is fine.
2380620	2382300	But there's another layer of design
2382300	2384860	that has to go into the game when you add this system in.
2384860	2389020	Since weapons break and can't be used until they're repaired if they hit zero condition,
2389020	2392300	the developers can put more powerful weapons in early game areas
2392300	2395100	in order to give you a taste of the direction the game's gonna go,
2395100	2398060	or give you something powerful but that you can only use a few times
2398060	2400460	so you can save it for more difficult moments.
2400460	2403500	So, lots of powerful weapons can be discovered early on
2403500	2405260	and give you a taste of things to come,
2405260	2406780	but have to be used sparingly.
2408140	2408640	Wait.
2409180	2410540	Can you see the contradiction here?
2411580	2414460	Powerful weapons being given to you early in low condition
2414460	2415980	because they can't be used too much,
2416860	2420220	and weapons that get weaker when they're in lower condition?
2421420	2423660	These two things don't go well together.
2423660	2425580	This means that the game ends up handing you a weapon
2425580	2428140	that's about as weak as all your other weapons.
2428140	2431020	You can find laser pistols in the Mart outside Megaton,
2431020	2431980	but guess what?
2431980	2434540	At this point, you probably haven't put much points into energy weapons
2434540	2436620	because you haven't even seen one yet,
2436620	2438700	and they're in such low condition
2438700	2441580	that they're equivalent to the weapons you were already using.
2441580	2443180	I've conferred with friends on this,
2443180	2446140	and several of them were led to believe that laser weapons were useless
2446140	2448140	because the ones they found were garbage.
2448140	2450540	This isn't just me and my weird pals, either.
2450540	2453580	The internet is really unsure what to think about energy weapons
2453580	2456060	because the first ones you encounter are terrible.
2456060	2458700	Plus, the repair system wasn't great
2458700	2461980	because you can only repair a weapon if you had another of the same weapon.
2461980	2464860	A lot of rare and supposedly powerful weapons could
2464860	2469020	rarely, if ever, be brought up to even a fraction of their actual power.
2469020	2473100	The only weapon that really survives this ridiculous damage curve is the Fat Man,
2473180	2477820	simply because it's so over-the-top powerful, even in a near-broken state.
2477820	2481500	The weapon degradation system is yet another pretty good idea
2481500	2484220	hamstrung by crazy poor execution.
2484220	2485660	Oh, and by the way,
2485660	2488700	shooters already had a mechanic for limiting your ability to use a weapon
2488700	2490780	that was more powerful than your current area.
2490780	2492540	It's called ammunition.
2492540	2495260	This is a gameplay feature that's been used in games like Doom
2495260	2497340	and the Resident Evil series for decades
2497340	2500380	without, pardon the pun, shooting itself in the foot
2500380	2504620	by also making the weapons hot garbage equivalents to what you were already using.
2504620	2507980	They simply rationed out the bullets you were using with them.
2507980	2508940	Anyway, where were we?
2516540	2518460	This video is already going to be super long,
2518460	2521340	so instead of talking at length too much about the morality system,
2521340	2524060	I'm going to use Vault 101's microcosmic nature
2524060	2527660	to illustrate the larger problem with Fallout 3's morality on the whole
2527660	2531180	and then maybe extemporate for a little bit too long anyway about other stuff.
2531180	2534700	The closest the game really comes to a meaningful decision in Vault 101
2534700	2538300	is whether or not you kill the Overseer who, by the way, wants you dead.
2538300	2540300	He doesn't openly initiate combat with you.
2540300	2542220	He just calls for your death.
2542220	2545980	In the middle of me fighting to protect myself from guys I can't talk down,
2545980	2547900	he engages you in a conversation,
2547900	2552060	and you finally have the chance to tell someone you don't want to kill them.
2552060	2553900	If you kill him for being a dick,
2553900	2555420	a martyr is upset at you.
2555900	2557100	Oh my god!
2557660	2558220	Daddy!
2559020	2562300	The game is using the Overseer's death as a teachable moment.
2562300	2563980	Killing people makes people sad.
2564540	2565040	Aww.
2565580	2567340	Maybe killing people's wrong.
2567340	2570700	Who appointed you judge, jury, and executioner?
2570700	2573420	But just wait one backflipping moment.
2573420	2574540	My mum watches my videos.
2574540	2575500	I can't swear too much.
2576140	2579100	That's the lesson I should take from this experience?
2579100	2580380	Amata, not to be rude,
2580940	2583980	but do you have any idea how many cops died
2583980	2586220	because he ordered them to attack me on sight?
2586220	2588300	And innocent people, too?
2588300	2593180	There's something insidious and fucked up to Fallout 3's approach to morality.
2593180	2595980	So many characters are utterly disposable.
2595980	2599740	Throughout the game, all sorts of people will shoot at you without a second thought,
2599740	2603260	and you will kill them, or you'll run away, or you'll die.
2604060	2608060	That's the extent of your moral interaction with a huge portion of the game's characters.
2608060	2610380	The game could have had a more nuanced perspective,
2610380	2614140	where the player is, at any point, made to consider that all these people had friends,
2614140	2615740	and parents, and children,
2615740	2620140	but instead, being nice is reserved for a couple of specific people,
2620140	2623660	who are often the most responsible for the problems you experience.
2623660	2628860	How nice of Bethesda to occasionally let me specifically be nice to one person.
2628860	2633100	Worse than not even giving you the option of being decent to these guys just doing their jobs,
2633100	2637660	the game has a fucking pop-up tell you when it deems an action as the right or wrong thing.
2637660	2641100	Yeah, that's right, let's talk about the amazing karma system.
2641100	2644940	I kind of feel like any game which can measure your morality with a number
2644940	2647580	is kind of problematic,
2647580	2653180	because it means, A, it thinks it is the arbiter of when something is a right or wrong decision,
2653180	2654780	in no uncertain terms,
2654780	2660060	or B, the game is stupid and so lacking in depth or complexity in its writing
2660060	2662700	that you really can boil things down that far.
2663420	2665740	You only really lose karma for stealing,
2665740	2669100	or for actively killing people who weren't shooting at you first,
2669100	2672060	but some people you do gain karma for openly killing,
2672060	2674060	because they're apparently just that bad,
2674060	2676940	so you can walk into a bar and do this.
2681500	2685100	But because he's a bad guy, everyone just sort of ignores it.
2685100	2689100	You gain karma for shooting a man in the face in public.
2689100	2690620	I did a good thing there.
2691260	2694140	Meanwhile, with a few specific characters,
2694140	2697020	often leaders of the groups that are trying to kill you,
2697020	2699180	the ones who initiate the whole thing,
2699180	2703340	all of a sudden, you're supposed to consider the importance of human life.
2703980	2707340	The Overseer is the first in a long line of people who you can spare,
2707340	2710220	or convince to change their ways, or give up, or whatever,
2710220	2713100	but who accidentally make the fact you kill your way wantonly
2713100	2716780	through so many people to get to them fall completely flat.
2716780	2719820	The player's required to only think about the human effects of their actions
2719820	2722380	once the game decides it's time to stop and think.
2723100	2726140	Yes, you can be nice and spare the Overseer.
2726860	2728060	But that guy's fucked!
2729260	2732300	Worse than not even giving you a chance to really be a good person,
2732300	2735900	the game doesn't even really let you be a bad person either.
2735900	2738140	And by bad person, I don't mean,
2738140	2740860	whoa, hey, let's kill all these people for no reason.
2740860	2742940	Whee! I'm so edgy!
2742940	2744540	My name is not important.
2747020	2747520	Whee!
2750140	2752940	I mean as in the game, never, and I do mean never,
2752940	2755500	puts you in a situation where the lines are blurred,
2755500	2758060	or where both sides in a conflict have a point,
2758060	2761980	or are both equally wrong and can be opposed by a superior idea,
2761980	2764700	or where only you benefit from the arrangement,
2764700	2767420	but in the long run, this might be better for the world as a whole
2767420	2769660	because you are, after all, the main character.
2770380	2774860	You're only ever really being nice, or being a fucking murder man.
2775740	2777500	That's a job in Fallout!
2777500	2780620	Comparatively, in a good game, for example, Fallout 1,
2780620	2783980	there's enough of a texture to the problems that are put in your path
2783980	2787740	that you can kind of see either side being justifiable.
2787740	2789740	If you side in Junk Town with Gizmo,
2789740	2792060	who's quite straightforwardly a self-interested dick
2792060	2795260	who wants the sheriff dead because it's bad for his business...
2795260	2798220	I want him dead because he cramps my business.
2799420	2801180	...Junk Town gets better.
2801180	2804940	It grows and becomes a far more successful town than it could have been before.
2804940	2807020	While I don't personally think it's a good choice,
2807020	2809660	there's enough room here that I could see someone
2809660	2813260	with different socio-political beliefs than me making a convincing argument
2813260	2816220	that Gizmo's version of Junk Town is a more prosperous one
2816220	2818220	that's ultimately better for the people in it.
2818220	2820540	That's right! Fallout 1 managed to give you options
2820540	2825340	where the right answer can depend on what you personally think is best for humanity!
2825340	2828780	And speaking of the towns made of junk that you encounter in the beginning of the game,
2828780	2831500	Fallout 3 attempts a similar choice with Megaton.
2831500	2835180	You can either make the bomb safe and help the people a little,
2835180	2838700	or blow the whole town to fucking smithereens.
2839740	2840940	Wait, what?!
2840940	2844620	That's right! Fallout 3's version of a nuanced moral choice is
2844620	2848060	do you want to kill a bunch of innocent people or not?
2848700	2850860	Is killing people for no reason okay?
2850860	2852300	What a complex question!
2852300	2853260	How deep?
2853260	2854540	Ten out of ten!
2854540	2857900	The nuke really well illustrates my problem with the game's moral system.
2857900	2861260	You walk into a town, and a guy motions you over and says,
2861260	2862780	hey, you want to kill everyone?
2862780	2864140	I know you have no reason to want this,
2864140	2866060	and to be honest, neither do I.
2866060	2867660	But, and to be even more honest,
2867660	2868940	neither does the guy I work for.
2868940	2870300	His reasoning's really poor,
2870300	2873420	but you'll feel like you're having an effect on the world, right?
2873420	2876220	And since Megaton is a town that can theoretically be blown up
2876220	2878140	very early in the game's story,
2878140	2880700	none of the characters in it actually matter very much.
2880700	2881900	They aren't allowed to.
2881900	2883900	Like in other shitty games with bad writing,
2883900	2887420	characters who might optionally die are often bad characters,
2887420	2889020	because when they live,
2889020	2892140	they can't be permitted to do anything useful or relevant to the story,
2892220	2894780	because then you'd have to write the version where that doesn't happen,
2894780	2898540	and that can require a lot of rewriting to account for both versions and so on.
2898540	2900060	In Mass Effect 1, for example,
2900060	2901980	you have the ability to let the entire council
2901980	2904300	that's been giving you orders the whole game die.
2904300	2907020	In the sequel, the council barely even comes up,
2907020	2908220	whether they lived or not.
2908220	2910060	This is because accounting for the deaths
2910060	2912460	of the most important people in a political system
2912460	2913740	is actually really difficult
2913740	2916140	if you then also have to account for them not dying.
2916140	2917740	By the time of Mass Effect 3,
2917740	2920700	Bioware fucking gave up on the idea of players having freedom,
2920700	2922060	and if you killed the council,
2922060	2924940	they get replaced by almost identical-looking copies
2924940	2926860	who are virtually no different.
2926860	2930380	You're essentially getting to choose what outfit the council is wearing,
2930380	2933900	so it becomes a decision that's ultimately set-dressing
2933900	2937500	for what some of the people you talk to on the space telephone look like.
2937500	2940540	Much like that decision, Fallout 3 renders its first town
2940540	2942620	practically meaningless on purpose,
2942620	2946780	because nothing of value can be at risk of having an effect on the wider story.
2946780	2948700	Even your dad doesn't get that mad
2948700	2951740	that you blew up a town and killed a bunch of people for no reason.
2951740	2953980	You're still my son, and I love you,
2953980	2957020	but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.
2957660	2960140	We'll talk more about this when there's time.
2960140	2962700	What—what do you have to do to get this guy to hate you?
2962700	2966860	Ironically, the most nuanced and interesting character in the game to me, Moira,
2966860	2969180	actually does survive this incident,
2969180	2972060	presumably because the developers put so much effort
2972060	2973900	into her long and varied quest
2973900	2976700	that they didn't want to risk players missing out on it,
2976700	2981260	so, effectively, walking into Megaton and shooting Moira in the head
2982300	2985100	has worse consequences for your future options
2985100	2987580	than blowing up the entire fucking town with a bomb.
2988380	2989420	Nice job, Bethesda.
2989980	2992940	Hey, Moira, if you can hear me, I found that landmine you wanted.
2992940	2994220	I'll bring it over.
2994220	2996380	Keep working on the survival guide!
2996380	3000300	They could have built an area that arguably deserved to be destroyed,
3000300	3002380	maybe because it relied on slavery
3002380	3005500	and was planning on expanding and causing more harm to others.
3005500	3009020	The player would have to weigh up the cost of invoking the nuclear option,
3009020	3011580	the innocents and slaves caught in the crossfire,
3011580	3015740	and possibly explore alternatives and live with those choices,
3015740	3018460	but instead they built a normal town and said,
3018460	3020380	hey, you want to blow it up for no reason?
3021020	3023740	The Be Good or Be History's Greatest Monster choice
3023740	3026860	is the only consistent set of choices you're given in the game.
3026860	3030300	Towards the end, you have the option of putting a virus in the wasteland's water
3030300	3034620	that purposefully makes it so that every mutant is probably going to die,
3034620	3036620	and the person who gives you this option
3036620	3040460	doesn't give you anywhere near a decent justification for this being a good idea.
3040460	3041820	We're going to come back to this later,
3041820	3044700	but the specific and consistent issue in this game
3044700	3047900	is that you can't really be a good person or a bad person
3047900	3052460	because there are no situations in which you have to decide what you think is best.
3052460	3055260	There are only objectively good or bad decisions.
3055260	3057500	I've chosen to play as a good guy this time.
3057500	3060380	Ooh, I wonder what being a murderer is like.
3060380	3062860	You leave the safety of your vault into this world, you know?
3063100	3064140	You're a big decision.
3064140	3066380	Am I going to help these people, or am I going to, you know,
3066380	3068780	do my own thing and serve my own selfish needs?
3068780	3071340	Help people or do my own thing.
3071340	3072860	Those aren't real choices.
3072860	3075740	What about giving the player different ways of helping people
3075740	3079340	with downsides or risks or wider effects for the rest of the world?
3079340	3083660	There's no junk town scenario where you have to at least stop to consider
3083660	3085900	that giving Gizmo the power to pursue his business
3085900	3089180	will pull more people into the town and make it stronger
3089180	3091100	than the guy who runs the town's police
3091100	3094700	and can be kind of iron-fisted about his ideas of what's moral.
3094700	3096620	You have to pick a side.
3096620	3100060	The end result is the player doesn't feel attached to the world of the game
3100060	3104700	because there's nothing that demands any real moral consideration on their part.
3104700	3107500	If you've decided to be good, here's all the tips I can give you.
3107500	3109980	Don't nuke the town and shoot the bad guys.
3110780	3114780	Fallout 3 reuses and references tons of aspects of the previous games,
3114780	3117500	which is normally fine, it's in a series,
3117500	3120940	but it reuses all of this stuff on a constant basis as a crutch,
3120940	3124620	and it never really does any of that old stuff the justice it deserves.
3124620	3126940	There are so many things that appear to have been brought back
3126940	3129980	simply so the game looks more like a Fallout game,
3129980	3132060	not because they actually needed to be there.
3132060	3133660	It's not because the game is bad.
3133660	3135100	It's because the game is good.
3135100	3136700	It's not because the game is bad.
3136700	3140620	A Fallout game, not because they actually needed to be there.
3140620	3142460	Similarly, the Super Mutants are back.
3142460	3144780	I expected this because they've been around since the first game,
3144780	3147500	but I didn't expect them to be so poorly done.
3147500	3149740	Fallout 1's mutants are dumb and violent,
3149740	3153660	but they have a purpose and a goal and a set of beliefs about themselves and the world.
3154300	3158620	The Super Mutant is the next advancement in human evolution.
3159420	3163020	Soon, everyone in the world will be converted,
3163740	3165740	and peace will reign.
3166700	3170060	They have a moral code that they believe will lead to peace.
3170060	3172620	You don't get the chance to spare any mutants in the first game,
3172620	3176140	but you're given ample opportunities to explore why they can't be,
3176140	3178380	and why they wouldn't listen to you.
3178380	3180300	In 2, the mutants are far less relevant,
3180300	3183580	but the final boss is technically a Super Mutant in power armor.
3183580	3186860	Otherwise, the mutants you do run into are all a little more chilled out.
3186860	3188860	You're talking a long time ago.
3188860	3190700	The world's moved on.
3190700	3194300	People are racist towards mutants for things that happened a long time before,
3194300	3197740	and the mutants secretly still believe that their master plan could have worked.
3197740	3200060	There's a texture to them, especially to Marcus,
3200060	3203180	who will happily claim he thinks his best human friend
3203180	3206140	would be better if they'd been turned into a mutant.
3206140	3208300	What a great mutant he would have been.
3208300	3211980	There are tensions, and yet there isn't any reason for hostility.
3211980	3215900	It's just people with different views and appearances learning slowly to get along.
3218220	3220460	In Fallout 3, the mutants are orcs.
3220460	3223180	They run around killing people for seemingly no reason.
3223180	3225180	They're dumb. They yell and scream about murder.
3225180	3227580	They keep bags of human gore lying around.
3228620	3232300	There's no master plan, no explanation, no justification.
3232300	3234780	They're raiders, but tinted green.
3234780	3236940	They're something for the Brotherhood to be fighting against,
3236940	3238700	and we'll get to the fucking Brotherhood.
3238700	3241820	The mutants are the most interesting characters in the series to me.
3241820	3244780	They live a long time and have a lot to think about.
3244780	3246940	Turning them into this is abysmal.
3246940	3249260	They needed something for the Super Mutants to do,
3249260	3251340	and they needed more things to shoot,
3251340	3251840	so...
3254380	3256460	But it's not just the mutants and the ghouls.
3256460	3259980	All kinds of things make a reappearance for seemingly no reason.
3259980	3263580	Harold, the mutant who appears in the first two games, is back.
3264140	3267980	The Ghek is back, because coming up with another MacGuffin is too much work,
3267980	3269820	and everyone knows the Ghek, right?
3269820	3272300	Oh, the Enclave are back, because people remember them.
3272300	3273980	They're still evil, wow!
3273980	3276220	Now you have guys in power armor to shoot.
3276220	3278380	Are you feeling serviced, fans?
3278380	3280620	Ah, face-to-face, at last.
3281180	3284620	Did you think having a conversation with a computer was an original idea?
3284620	3285260	Wrong!
3285260	3289660	Fucking Zax in the basement of The Glow in Fallout 1 was a talking robot,
3289660	3291660	and you could play chess with him,
3291660	3293820	and discuss what it means to be human,
3293820	3296460	and evolution, and the mutation,
3296460	3300060	and the nature of artificial intelligence in infinitely more detail
3300060	3303260	than any conversation you can have with John Henry Eden.
3303820	3305820	Zax might seem like a minor point,
3305820	3308860	but it speaks volumes about the difference in writing quality,
3308860	3312860	that while in Fallout 1 you can have longer and more philosophically interesting conversations
3312860	3316700	than that take place anywhere in Fallout 3 with an optional character,
3316700	3319660	I'll bet a huge portion of players never even found.
3319660	3322860	And then we have the Brotherhood of Steel.
3323660	3324860	Let's go back again.
3324860	3328940	In Fallout 1, you barely see much of them for most of the game,
3328940	3331740	but their face is looking right at you when you open it.
3331740	3332860	They're coming.
3332860	3334140	They're coming, oh boy!
3334140	3335900	And when you do meet them and you want to join,
3335900	3339500	they send you on a suicide mission that they intend for you to die on.
3339500	3344060	In fact, when you get there, you find the corpses of the previous people they sent.
3344060	3345500	You learn they hoard technology,
3345500	3349020	and they're kind of isolationists who believe in keeping track of technology,
3349020	3351980	and science, and knowledge in order to preserve it for the future,
3351980	3355180	so that the best of humanity can be restored in better days.
3355180	3357180	Even though you can gain an understanding of them,
3357180	3359100	and convince them to help you a little,
3359100	3362300	they ultimately remain hidden underground.
3362300	3363260	That's their choice.
3363980	3368060	The beautiful, capital-B beautiful thing about the Brotherhood of Steel
3368060	3369340	is that they're so human.
3369900	3374700	They're likable, they're cool, they're smart, they're powerful, and they're wrong.
3375340	3379500	Fallout 2 is the story of their failure to truly help the world or themselves
3379500	3381500	as they wither away into nothingness.
3381500	3383980	The title screen of 2 is an enclave soldier.
3383980	3387660	The Brotherhood have been replaced as the strongest faction in the Wasteland.
3387660	3392220	And a loading screen features a tribal in the same pose as the knight from Fallout 1's title screen,
3392220	3394220	wearing a desecrated Brotherhood helmet.
3394780	3397020	That's some pretty powerful imagery right there,
3397020	3398700	especially for a loading screen.
3398700	3400540	They were never really the good guys,
3400540	3402060	but they did care,
3402620	3404700	and you kind of feel sad for their mistakes.
3405420	3408140	In Fallout 3, the Brotherhood run around shooting mutants
3408140	3410220	because they're the good guys now.
3410780	3411980	And no, I'm not saying,
3411980	3415020	well, I'm a big baby, you have to do the Brotherhood this way.
3415020	3418060	No, they can be any way the writer wants them to.
3418060	3421660	They could not even be in a Fallout game because they all died.
3422220	3426300	They could be six guys holding on after the end of their whole way of life.
3426300	3429180	They could be exactly the sort of group they are in Fallout 3.
3429180	3430460	But whatever they are,
3430460	3431980	they have to be done well.
3432540	3437580	None of the Brotherhood are given sufficient levels of characterization or writing or relatability.
3437580	3440460	You never really understand these people.
3440460	3441900	They feel like props.
3441900	3444700	The majority of your interaction with them is part of the main story,
3444700	3445580	which we will get to,
3446140	3448620	or just kind of uninteresting busywork.
3448620	3452220	There's a central area with some generic guys shooting at targets,
3452220	3455340	some rooms off to the side with a couple of people you can talk to a little,
3455340	3457980	but there's nothing you can really gain from them.
3457980	3460140	Nothing really happens here.
3460140	3464620	It's like a Brotherhood of Steel-themed attraction at a park.
3464620	3465740	It doesn't feel like a place,
3465740	3468540	and the Brotherhood doesn't feel like a cohesive group.
3468540	3473340	In Fallout 1, the Brotherhood of Steel was a place you could get quite invested in learning about,
3473340	3475580	with a multifaceted membership.
3475580	3478700	The Brotherhood weren't just a place you could get guns and plot.
3478700	3480140	Fallout 1 has talking heads,
3480140	3481980	but when you talk to someone occasionally,
3481980	3483660	you get a big shot of their face,
3483660	3485980	and, uh, ooh, they mouth at you.
3485980	3489660	What the bloody, bloody, bloody hell are you doing here?!
3489660	3494380	There are four of the game's, what, ten talking heads in the Brotherhood base,
3494380	3498700	and all of them have a distinct personality from the moment you walk up to them.
3498700	3501740	Greetings. It's a fine day for learning.
3501740	3506140	You have Cabot, the obedient, nice, but kind of dumb door guy
3506140	3510140	who does the real work of defending the place and hefts the big guns.
3510140	3514220	You have Vree, the head scribe who privileges knowledge and invention.
3514220	3515660	Speak to the knights.
3515660	3518860	Ask them to show you one of the latest laser pistols I designed.
3518860	3521660	That's right. In Fallout 1, new things are being made.
3521660	3523500	They're not just salvaging old technology,
3523500	3524780	in stark contrast to 3,
3524780	3528140	where all characters are doing nothing but salvage old discarded shit
3528140	3529580	and creating nothing of their own.
3529580	3532220	Ironically, the same attitude the developers had.
3532220	3535340	Vree specifically doesn't think history itself is important.
3535340	3540300	She's more interested in researching the sciences and discovering the future than in the past.
3540300	3544220	You have head paladin Rhombus, a gruff and no-nonsense guy
3544220	3547500	who doesn't really want to talk to you and directs you to Vree
3547500	3550860	if you ask anything sciencey or that requires a long-winded explanation.
3550860	3552700	Talk to Vree in the main library.
3552700	3555340	He represents the militaristic nature of the Brotherhood
3555340	3557740	and their descendants from the US Army.
3557740	3561980	I could teach you how to fight if you had any ability.
3561980	3563980	You have General Maxson, the High Elder,
3563980	3566300	who manages to have a sense of humour and friendliness,
3566300	3570780	but also a sharp wit and an openly militaristic discipline streak to him.
3571420	3573980	You can tell just from how he's written
3573980	3577020	that he was a fighter himself before he was given command.
3577020	3580940	He's a leader who embodies a nice mix of the traits of the other three characters.
3580940	3584380	This gives you a sense that the Brotherhood at its core really is a brotherhood,
3584380	3587180	a fraternity of people who take care of each other
3587180	3589420	and are ultimately very close-knit,
3589420	3592460	not just visible in their constant worrying about the missing knights
3592460	3596860	who went out on an expedition whose trail you can pick up on and eventually rescue,
3596860	3600540	but in things as simple as how their leader comprises a mix
3600540	3602940	of all of their attitudes and beliefs.
3602940	3605820	The Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 1 gives a convincing impression
3605820	3607900	of a functioning mini-society,
3607900	3612780	creating a sense of a vast group of different intersecting personalities within their halls,
3612780	3615420	and it does it with four faces.
3615420	3618700	Every single member of the Brotherhood in Fallout 3 has a face,
3618700	3621740	but they barely have one personality between them.
3622300	3624380	The Brotherhood is at your service.
3624380	3626060	The Brotherhood is at your service.
3626700	3630300	You can shoot them into tiny pieces of carefully modelled meat,
3630300	3633580	but you can't have a meaningful conversation about science with them.
3634220	3637100	It's very clear that Bethesda wanted to do their own versions
3637100	3639340	of Maxson, Rhombus, Vree, and Cabot,
3639340	3643260	either as yet another reference or because they genuinely had no ideas of their own,
3643260	3645420	so here's a test of these new characters.
3646140	3647260	What's this guy's name?
3648060	3651740	What sort of personality does he have besides generic door guard?
3651740	3657020	Cabot's name has been burned into my brain since I played Fallout 1 about 14 years ago.
3657580	3659740	He had a lovely, unassuming nature,
3659740	3661500	a uniquely shaped head,
3661500	3664220	and represented not only the Brotherhood's defensiveness,
3664220	3666540	but their inner kindness to one another.
3666540	3670700	I want to take Cabot for a walk on the beach and just talk about stuff for a while.
3670700	3674380	Fallout 3 was a chance to show a chapter of the Brotherhood that had redeemed themselves,
3674380	3676700	where they saw the result of their foolishness coming
3676700	3680220	and decided to help the people of the Wasteland form a better society,
3680220	3684060	but instead they're a confusing mishmash of their presentation in the first two games,
3684060	3686540	being rude to outsiders, not letting anyone in,
3686540	3688060	with cookie-cutter,
3688060	3691580	maybe being nice to people is a good thing nonsense mixed in with it.
3691580	3694540	None of them offer any real justification for this change,
3694540	3696620	and even as characters in themselves,
3696620	3700620	none of them even say anything as flavourful and character-establishing
3700620	3703580	as it's a fine day for learning.
3704220	3704940	So there.
3704940	3708780	I hope that makes me seem not against changing the Brotherhood on principle,
3708780	3713260	just against changing it badly and not giving them enough characterisation or justification
3713260	3715420	for why they are how they are.
3715420	3719660	Just like how I'm not strictly against the idea of there being a Mega Man cartoon,
3719660	3721500	but that doesn't mean I'm okay with...
3721500	3723660	♪ Super-flying robot! ♪
3724700	3726300	♪ Yeah, yeah! ♪
3727100	3728780	♪ Super-flying robot! ♪
3728780	3732620	The re-use of old concepts smacks, like with the opening birth scene,
3732620	3735740	of hasty attempts at storytelling and world-building.
3735740	3738540	It's as if the developers were handed the rights to three,
3738540	3740140	and they knew they had to make a game,
3740140	3742620	but not what should actually go into it,
3742620	3745660	resulting in a cobbled-together mishmash of whatever
3745660	3748780	original ideas they came up with in some initial meeting,
3748780	3752620	and ideas borrowed from the other games but given no real thought.
3752620	3757820	The Fallout series is characterised largely not by adherence to a core set of concepts,
3757820	3759260	but by change.
3759260	3762780	War never changes, but the world the war is fought in does.
3762780	3765100	In Fallout 2, things changed.
3765100	3768060	The Super Mutants weren't trying to conquer the world in the name of progress,
3768060	3770380	they were survivors of a dead ideology,
3770380	3772860	and the ones left were trying to do good,
3772860	3774220	or at least have some peace,
3774220	3777660	living in a town founded on the site where a Brotherhood knight
3777660	3779900	and a Super Mutant fought for so long
3779900	3782140	that they realised how pointless it was,
3782140	3784700	and sat down and started working together.
3784780	3789020	That sort of concept was unthinkable in the world of the first Fallout.
3789020	3792540	Things didn't stay the same just for the sake of being like the old one.
3792540	3794460	Even the money changed.
3794460	3796860	Fallout 3 didn't know what it wanted to be,
3796860	3799900	or how to grow or shift or change these things,
3799900	3802780	so it ended up playing like a Cliff Notes version of the ideas
3802780	3805580	that were popular or well-known in the previous ones.
3805580	3806620	Caps are back,
3806620	3810460	because caps are a pop-culturally-remembered thing from Fallout 1.
3810460	3813500	The Mutants are here, but they're just generic bad guys.
3813580	3815900	The Brotherhood of Steel has changed,
3815900	3819500	but rather than an interesting or meaningful or fitting change,
3819500	3824300	they're boiled down to such goody-two-shoes heroes of the wasteland with no depth
3824300	3827420	that they fail to actually progress the Brotherhood thematically.
3827420	3831500	They're like a misremembered version of the Brotherhood from the first two games.
3831500	3833900	If you boiled it down really, really far down,
3833900	3837740	you could have called the Brotherhood the goodies in 1 and 2.
3837740	3840140	So that's what got translated over.
3840140	3842140	It's like playing a game of telephone.
3842140	3843020	Ring ring!
3843020	3843980	Hello?
3843980	3844860	What's that?
3844860	3846860	I'm a bad game designer!
3846860	3848460	Whaaaaa—
3848460	3850140	Todd Howard doesn't sound like that.
3855660	3859660	But the one thing that makes Fallout truly special is its themes,
3859660	3863980	its wider story about humans and the problems we face within ourselves
3863980	3866220	and how we conquer them and progress to new ones.
3866220	3868220	Everyone likes to pretend that their favorite game has—
3868220	3869580	Ooh, it's an internal struggle!
3869580	3871740	But Fallout gets it real, man!
3871740	3875580	Despite being open-world games where the player can go anywhere
3875580	3878940	and with stories over which the player has a tremendous amount of influence,
3878940	3882540	the original games manage to be incredibly well-structured and paced.
3882540	3885580	You start small, getting sucked into the squabble and junk town,
3885580	3888220	and then you find yourself inexorably drawn to the hub.
3888220	3891660	Each game begins with relative chaos in which everything's up for grabs,
3891660	3893500	but there isn't much to grab,
3893500	3896380	and you're skirmishing with small groups over petty issues,
3896380	3900060	and things are messy and difficult and almost seem to lack a moral dimension
3900060	3903420	because you're still making your way and figuring out what's going on
3903420	3905740	and getting the equipment you need to save your vault.
3905740	3907660	Then, as you get more educated,
3907660	3911500	you discover areas with complex but identifiable moral problems.
3911500	3916140	Entire populations are at stake if you execute an idea poorly or take the easy option.
3916140	3919580	Getting the water chip can doom the ghoul community of Necropolis
3919580	3921820	if you don't help them fix their own water problems,
3921820	3925100	and their community has members who could do with getting rid of, too,
3925100	3927820	not to mention the mutants standing right there!
3927820	3930860	Unfortunately for them, we can see an isometric.
3930860	3932380	Not every decision is easy,
3932380	3934620	but you develop a sense of how to make things right
3934620	3937500	and a consideration for the wiser effects of your actions.
3937500	3939260	You fight larger and stronger groups,
3939260	3941660	and by this point, you're assisted by a crew of your own.
3941660	3943980	You get better weapons and armor and more allies.
3943980	3945180	You get smart.
3945180	3947180	Then, in the final act,
3947180	3948860	you get access to amazing technology
3948860	3952860	and an incredibly in-depth understanding of why the world is the way it is,
3952860	3955980	from speaking to scientists and Zaks.
3955980	3957500	The tension keeps rising,
3957500	3959580	but all the distractions scale back.
3959580	3961580	The fate of the world is at stake,
3961580	3964780	not because the crosshairs are manually on people like before,
3964780	3968620	but because you're getting confronted with the questions that lie at the heart of the world,
3968620	3970540	and having to come up with a solution to them,
3970540	3972620	or everything is fucked.
3972620	3975100	Concepts solidify and sides are taken,
3975100	3978700	the true motivating forces behind the problems the world face are made known,
3978700	3979980	and then,
3979980	3981100	finally,
3981100	3983100	you go to meet them.
3984060	3988060	You make contact with the followers of the Apocalypse,
3988060	3990940	a group that has infiltrated the cathedral built on top of the vault
3990940	3994060	where the master, the leader of the mutants, is residing.
3994060	3995500	They send a lot of help with you,
3995500	3997340	and you descend into the corrupted vault,
3997340	3999260	covered in proto-Lovecraftian ooze
3999260	4001980	and swarming with mutants, monsters, and psychics.
4001980	4003980	The final fight is very difficult.
4003980	4005260	The mutants are numerous,
4005260	4008700	which doesn't go well with the incredible danger even one of them can pose.
4008700	4011900	They eventually thin out, but so do your allies.
4011900	4013660	This fight seems specifically designed
4013660	4016540	so it's a struggle even for the strongest possible character,
4016540	4019980	and no one who enters with you will leave alive.
4019980	4021420	But eventually,
4021420	4022780	the enemies thin out,
4022780	4024060	paring away,
4024060	4026540	until you're alone in a hallway,
4026540	4029020	and at the end is one person.
4029020	4032300	The entire game is preparing you for the moment
4032300	4033820	where you and the master,
4033820	4035980	who's been in charge of the entire mutant problem
4035980	4038700	that threatens the world with domination this whole time,
4038700	4040700	stand in a room together and talk.
4040700	4043340	This final hallway tenses me up every time.
4043340	4046380	It's a confrontation with a comprehensive belief system
4046380	4048860	that so far has been doing really well for itself,
4048860	4050060	and you have to stop it,
4050060	4052060	or mankind is probably done.
4052060	4054540	You've gone from fighting scorpions to getting antidotes
4054540	4056060	so someone will sell you a rope
4056060	4059260	and slap fights with casino owners over their business practices,
4059260	4062220	to sitting next to the arbiter of the world's doom
4062220	4064860	and trying to explain what is wrong with their plan,
4064860	4066700	and it happens seamlessly.
4066700	4068620	So what shall it be?
4068620	4070380	Do you join the unity,
4070380	4072140	or do you die here?
4072140	4074300	Everything has been pushing you towards the moment
4074300	4076780	when you have to tell the man who thinks he has the solution
4076780	4078460	to the problems you've been facing
4078460	4080060	that he's wrong.
4080060	4082540	These are the crowning moments of Fallout.
4082540	4084140	They're the culmination of their story,
4084140	4085340	their themes, their ideas,
4085340	4087660	and all of your character's choices, too.
4087660	4088940	Do you just want to fight them?
4088940	4091980	Are you unprepared, making the fight unavoidable and difficult?
4091980	4094380	Do you try to talk to them and maybe, just maybe,
4094380	4095500	change their mind?
4095500	4097740	The conversation with the master is nuts.
4097740	4099180	He wants to know where your vault is
4099180	4101660	and has a compelling reason you should tell him.
4101660	4103820	It's a chance to assure the mutants can be strong enough
4103820	4106940	to survive the wastes where mankind has and will not.
4106940	4109100	As long as there are differences,
4109100	4112460	we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other.
4112460	4115660	Because there are no obvious speech options popping up with percentiles,
4115660	4119500	there's no way of telling what the best way of attempting to talk him down might be
4119500	4121340	except for your own judgment.
4121340	4123580	You have to engage him as a reasonable person.
4123580	4124780	The best thing is,
4124780	4127660	it's impossible for him to be talked down on moral grounds.
4127660	4131180	He doesn't care about mankind's survival or killing people
4131180	4133660	because for him, the mutants are the future of mankind
4133660	4135660	and the ends justify the means.
4135660	4138300	The only way to talk him down
4138300	4141180	is to explain why the plan wouldn't work.
4141180	4142780	This isn't just a speech check.
4142780	4145740	To do this, you have to ask everyone about the mutants,
4145740	4147500	about what makes them what they are.
4147500	4150460	Eventually, you can find through Vree that the mutants are sterile,
4150460	4153020	and she gives you the evidence that proves this is the case.
4153020	4155420	The master rejects this as a forgery anyway.
4155420	4157740	You have to get him to ask his own mutants
4157740	4160620	if any of them have gotten pregnant before he realizes the truth.
4185500	4186700	...and healing.
4188060	4189100	It was madness.
4190540	4191820	I can see that now.
4192460	4193180	Madness.
4193180	4194380	Madness?
4194380	4195420	There is no hope.
4197020	4197660	Leave now.
4198860	4201500	Leave while you still have...
4201500	4202620	...hope.
4215420	4218620	The final speech he gives is sad, amazing,
4218620	4221660	and deeply humanizing for such a monstrous character.
4221660	4224460	Video game characters rarely have good voice actors,
4224460	4226220	and the master has, too,
4226220	4228380	playing about four different voices.
4228380	4231660	Jim Cummings and Kath Soucie both make great performances
4231660	4235260	that contribute to one of the best moments in video game character history.
4235260	4238220	After that, all that's left is to fight your way through another
4238220	4241180	and hopefully, you'll be able to get to the end of the story.
4242140	4246380	After that, all that's left is to fight your way through an army of his men
4246380	4248940	and escape the base before the GAME CRASHES!
4248940	4250860	I mean before the base explodes.
4250860	4255740	Outwitting the master feels like you've genuinely contended with an apocalyptic ideology
4255740	4258300	and beaten it with intelligence and reason,
4258300	4262300	not simply the strength of your gun or some cookie-cutter heroic speech.
4262300	4266780	By the way, the male voices of the master are by the same man who voices Winnie the Pooh.
4266780	4268300	I just thought I'd let you know that.
4268300	4270540	Fallout 2 does a lot to...
4270540	4271900	Fallout 2 does a lot as well.
4272540	4276060	Frank Horrigan has a similar culmination of that game's themes,
4276060	4278860	but if I talk about it now, I'll be here for another hour,
4278860	4280780	so I'm just gonna skip ahead, okay?
4280780	4282060	It's good. It's good.
4282060	4284380	Play Fallout 2. Play it. Please.
4285020	4287580	The part where you have a short talk to the man in the room
4287580	4289660	who embodies all the problems you've faced
4289660	4292860	is the best part of those two Fallout games by far to me.
4292860	4294940	They tie everything together.
4294940	4297100	Fallout 3 pits you against Colonel Autumn.
4297740	4298780	You again.
4303980	4306460	Autumn has been a dick to you personally,
4306460	4310140	but he doesn't represent any major flaw in the world of Fallout 3.
4310140	4312620	He isn't the culmination of the problems you've seen.
4312620	4315020	He just sort of turns up halfway through.
4315020	4316940	He's just a guy standing there saying,
4316940	4319020	well, I guess it's time for us to fight now.
4319020	4321820	And in the space of three lines of conversation,
4321820	4324860	if you pass a speech check, you can talk him out of fighting,
4324940	4326140	you can talk him out of fighting,
4326140	4327980	and he just fucking walks out.
4327980	4330380	Colonel Autumn doesn't really stand for anything.
4330380	4331420	He doesn't want anything.
4331420	4334380	He doesn't represent any core concept you've had to face
4334380	4335420	over the course of the game.
4335980	4339340	He's a wet fart on the face of Fallout storytelling.
4339340	4341660	He's a piss in the mouth of philosophy.
4341660	4344380	He's a sledgehammer to the balls of the inner child
4344380	4345580	of the mind of thought.
4348140	4350540	This character has broken my brain!
4350540	4352460	The ending, this final room,
4352460	4356140	could have made everything about the game come together and make sense.
4356140	4358700	It would be difficult, but it could have happened,
4358700	4360860	and at least put a nice bow on things.
4360860	4364140	But instead, it's exactly the ending you would fucking expect
4364140	4365660	from the rest of Fallout 3,
4365660	4368460	and yet that somehow still feels disappointing.
4368460	4371740	Worse than that, this game had two chances to get this right.
4371740	4373340	There were two men in rooms.
4373340	4376220	When you meet President Eden, you're in a similar scenario.
4376220	4378540	Eden wants to convince you to enact his genocide,
4378540	4381020	but unlike with the Master or the Lieutenant or anyone,
4381020	4383660	there's no explanation, no underlying motive.
4383660	4384380	It's just,
4384380	4385580	I am bad guy.
4385580	4388140	We need to kill mutants. Genocide good.
4388140	4391660	Super mutants and ghouls must be purged.
4391660	4395420	We need to clear the way for humanity to rebuild the wastes.
4396140	4397980	The Master had a comprehensive explanation
4397980	4401340	for why the human race needed to be converted into mutants now.
4401340	4404380	Bethesda can't come up with a single compelling explanation
4404380	4406300	for why this is actually a good idea
4406300	4407660	beyond the platitude of,
4407660	4409180	we need to undo mutants.
4409180	4410780	Do you get it? I'm a racist.
4411180	4413260	There's no philosophical struggle.
4413260	4415980	It's impossible to even attempt to reason out
4415980	4419020	why this philosophy is right or wrong in a rational manner
4419020	4422460	because it's so fucking stupid that it defies rationality.
4422460	4425580	You can't show him that the mutants aren't the real problem,
4425580	4428700	that the real problem is something even the Enclave are a part of,
4428700	4433580	the all-too-human need to continue to make unending war and death.
4433580	4435100	How do you talk him down, then?
4435100	4437980	Well, you get a please-kill-yourself speech option,
4437980	4439820	and then you say, uh, you know,
4439820	4441500	don't be bad. It's bad.
4441500	4443420	Aren't you tired of being bad?
4443420	4445260	And then he says, okay.
4445980	4447340	Yes, I suppose it is.
4448220	4448940	Very well.
4449580	4451260	I'll put an end to the Enclave.
4452140	4452780	And he does.
4460060	4462140	This should be a joke,
4462140	4465660	like, wow, President Eden was poorly fucking programmed,
4465660	4469180	or the Enclave are fucking idiots all the way up to the top.
4469180	4471900	But because there's no real discussion or struggle
4471900	4476460	or philosophical point to be made by any of the factions or characters in this game,
4476460	4481260	it becomes strikingly clear that this really was the best Bethesda could do,
4481260	4482940	and that's just sad.
4482940	4485900	Speaking of stupid, one-dimensional choices,
4485900	4488700	after dealing with Autumn, you get one more moral choice.
4489340	4491500	Someone has to save the Purifier,
4491500	4494620	but they will die trying in the radioactive chamber.
4494620	4497020	This choice fundamentally decides your ending.
4497020	4498780	If you do it, you're a hero.
4498780	4501740	If you let the real main character, who's been making the real choices,
4501740	4503500	leading the charge, making the speeches,
4503500	4507580	and literally has been putting her life on the line the entire time to do it,
4507580	4508780	you're a coward.
4508780	4510620	You can be good or bad.
4510620	4513820	It's exactly the moral choice Fallout 3 would give you.
4513820	4516060	That's it. No nuance, no chance to argue,
4516060	4519980	hey, maybe these heroic people who love helping people and being nice could do it.
4519980	4522220	If you pick Lyons, regardless of your reasoning,
4522220	4524380	you're basically objectively a coward.
4524380	4525260	And then it's over.
4525260	4526860	You get your fucking slideshow,
4526860	4528620	and war never changes,
4528620	4529500	and goodbye.
4530060	4531500	Which one of you did this?
4531500	4532460	Which one?!
4532460	4534060	Wait a second, I brought Forks with me.
4534060	4535420	He's immune to radiation.
4535420	4538540	In fact, earlier in the game, he did that.
4538540	4541100	Why doesn't he just save the world and let us all live?
4541660	4542460	No.
4542460	4544780	Oh, well, that's just fucking great!
4544780	4550220	The developers created an ending choice so stupid within their own fiction
4550220	4554220	that all of a sudden, the fucking hyper-intelligent mutant
4554220	4557580	has to develop a sense of destiny to fear denying you.
4557580	4561340	They wanted to pick the most generic hero-coward choice possible,
4561340	4563260	and to do it, they deliberately had to make sure
4563260	4567500	the far better option wasn't available for no reason!
4567500	4569420	Do you want to do this stupid thing,
4569420	4571820	or this stupid but evil thing?
4571820	4575260	What about this clear third option that's actually better than either?
4575260	4575900	No.
4575900	4580700	If you are writing an open-ended RPG about choice and morality,
4580700	4583740	and there is a clear option the player could decide to take,
4583820	4587260	and you put the option there, and you tell them no,
4587260	4588140	you fucked up!
4588700	4590380	But you didn't just fuck up the ending,
4590380	4593020	because the sort of idiots who would make this decision
4593020	4594780	made the rest of the game too.
4594780	4598140	Those same shit-stained fingerprints are all over it.
4598140	4601100	Pick a cartoon character, or kill them both.
4601100	4603820	Nuke a town for no reason, or don't.
4603820	4606220	Ask Tenpenny Tower not to be racist,
4606220	4609260	or fucking murder a bunch of innocent girls for no reason.
4609260	4611180	I don't even know what Autumn wanted.
4611180	4613660	He was against Eden's genocide plan.
4613740	4615500	Seemingly all Autumn wanted
4615500	4618620	was for the Purity Project to have an Enclave sticker on it.
4618620	4621500	When it isn't clear what the final boss's plan is,
4621500	4623500	it's time to do a rewrite.
4623500	4625340	No, wait! I didn't mean that!
4625340	4626060	No!
4626060	4626560	No—
4630460	4632460	Do you get it? It's a reference to the name of the final—
4632460	4633340	Ah, whatever.
4633340	4635020	We all knew I was going to cover this.
4635020	4636540	Everyone hated the ending.
4636540	4638460	People hated Bethesda so much,
4638460	4640700	they wanted to shit themselves inside out.
4640700	4642540	They were made of piss.
4642540	4644300	There isn't enough hyperbole to explain
4644300	4647180	how mad people were with the stupid ending.
4647180	4649820	Then Bethesda released the Broken Steel DLC.
4649820	4652220	So now you survive your heroic sacrifice.
4653500	4656860	While being able to carry on is arguably a straightforward improvement,
4656860	4659100	it speaks volumes that the developers either
4659100	4659820	A.
4659820	4661580	didn't think of that in the first place
4661580	4664460	in the years it took making and playtesting the game,
4664460	4667100	during which they claimed to have played the originals.
4667100	4667900	Hmm.
4667900	4670140	Maybe we should make a version of Fallout 2
4670140	4671500	that's missing a key feature
4671500	4674540	and hope the player has a save before the ending started.
4674540	4676060	Great idea, Todd!
4676060	4677180	And while you're at it,
4677180	4680220	let's add more companions who are immune to radiation
4680220	4682460	but refuse to fix the purifier.
4682460	4684540	By the way, Todd, you don't sound so good.
4684540	4685260	Are you okay?
4685820	4686540	Or B.
4686540	4689900	They really believed in the finality of their project
4689900	4693100	in giving the Lone Wanderer a semblance of a complete arc
4693100	4694620	going from birth to death,
4694620	4697900	then walked back on it the instant people complained.
4698540	4699500	Or C.
4699500	4701980	Did this deliberately so players would buy the DLC
4701980	4703900	unless some carry on playing their game.
4703900	4707020	You'll notice there's no footage from Broken Steel in this video.
4707820	4709900	That's because, back when it came out,
4709900	4711500	I found myself wondering
4711500	4714860	why I would pay to play more of Fallout 3.
4714860	4717740	I had already accidentally slipped and hit the button
4717740	4719500	that buys Operation Anchorage,
4719500	4722540	a ten-quid-costing corridor full of generic enemies
4722540	4723740	you can't talk to,
4723740	4725420	terminating in a general who gives up
4725420	4727020	if you say one thing to him.
4727020	4729580	In other words, a microcosm of the actual game.
4730300	4732140	Players had to fix the beginning,
4732140	4734140	the developers had to fix the end,
4734140	4737020	and that leaves only a middle consisting of hollow nonsense
4737020	4739180	where you shoot the bad guys until they die
4739180	4741820	and collect Fallout-themed MacGuffins.
4741820	4744220	It's no surprise that players who have the most fun
4744220	4747020	are the ones who traipse around on their own kind of adventure,
4747020	4750540	shunning the garbage experience poorly planned for their perusal,
4750540	4752860	flicking on the radio, and just doing whatever they like.
4752860	4754780	A friend who is way smarter than me
4754780	4757100	has played Fallout 3 for a very long time,
4757100	4758140	and still does,
4758140	4760220	because they essentially just walk around,
4760220	4761980	taking very little interest in the experience
4761980	4763340	the world had planned for them.
4763340	4765020	The best way to have fun with the game
4765020	4768460	is to view the whole thing as something to take a walking tour through,
4768460	4770380	purposefully carving out your own journey
4770380	4772220	almost in spite of the game itself.
4772220	4773980	These people aren't playing the game wrong
4773980	4775820	for not focusing on the story.
4775820	4777660	They're proving how wrong the game is
4777660	4780220	by showing how differently the game has to be approached
4780220	4781660	in order to be enjoyed.
4781660	4784540	It is a story-driven action RPG
4784540	4785980	in which, to have fun,
4785980	4788780	you have to avoid the story on purpose.
4793100	4795580	For a long time, like, years,
4795580	4797500	I was pretty sure Fallout 3 wasn't just bad,
4797500	4801180	but it was proof you couldn't make a nuanced 3D game of its scale
4801180	4802540	without it being bad.
4802540	4804540	There wasn't enough time to make it good.
4804540	4807020	There was too much manpower involved.
4807020	4810060	I thought that maybe the future was dark for RPGs.
4810060	4811580	When New Vegas came out,
4811580	4813500	I didn't play it for about two years.
4813500	4814780	I'd been burned before.
4814780	4816460	But then one day in university,
4817420	4818460	I did.
4834380	4837100	Fallout New Vegas is the fourth game on that list.
4837820	4839740	It fixed everything.
4839740	4842220	The opening isn't seven million hours long
4842220	4844460	populated with unavoidable murder.
4844460	4846140	You walk over to a machine,
4846140	4847180	pick your stats,
4847180	4848780	sit a short personality test,
4848780	4850140	and you go on an adventure.
4850860	4852380	Traits are back.
4852380	4854300	The mutants in Brotherhood and Enclave
4854300	4856140	are treated differently from their appearances
4856140	4857660	in 1, 2, and 3,
4857660	4859900	and their changes are explained and justified
4859900	4861100	and understandable
4861100	4863180	while not distracting from the main story,
4863180	4866460	which concerns the threat posed by an entirely new faction
4866460	4869500	because the creators knew how to come up with new ideas.
4869500	4873500	And the new faction is a group of seemingly unjustifiably genocidal fascists,
4873500	4875260	but when you sit down with their leader,
4875260	4879340	he gives a meaningful and legitimate criticism of democracy itself
4879340	4882060	and starts talking about the Hegelian dialectic.
4882060	4884220	When that happened the first time I played,
4884220	4889260	I cried the only two tears I have ever wept playing a video game.
4889260	4891820	I am not embarrassed to admit that even a little.
4892780	4894620	Conversations are fixed.
4894620	4897980	Not only are speech checks no longer just a fucking dice roll,
4897980	4899980	you can use skills besides speech,
4899980	4901260	especially barter,
4901260	4902220	to get an edge,
4902220	4903660	but if you don't have enough,
4903660	4907420	you get a joke option that automatically fails just for fun.
4907420	4909660	You can repair weapons using other stuff,
4909660	4912300	making the laser pistol you find in the first room of the game
4912300	4914460	an immediately useful option.
4914460	4915340	That's right!
4915340	4918460	The weapons work in Fallout New Vegas!
4918460	4922060	The game's writing and acting is so nuanced,
4922060	4925900	you can tell what a character's stance is on Caesar's Legion
4925900	4929180	based on how they pronounce the name Caesar.
4929180	4931500	The world's design is paste,
4931500	4933900	so the game actually gets harder as you go,
4933900	4938220	and you actually need all the crazy explosives you pick up on the way.
4938220	4940620	The only problems I can identify are
4940620	4943020	the game crashes when you try to resurrect yourself,
4943020	4946780	which seems ironic given how the game starts with you doing that,
4946780	4950060	and that I can't seem to uninstall the giant bouncy breast mod
4950060	4953100	a friend installed on my computer at a party years ago,
4953100	4956380	despite making fresh installs on several computers.
4956380	4957740	That is a true story.
4957740	4960700	It is a true story, and I have healthy beliefs about women,
4960700	4961740	and...
4961740	4963180	Just cut this part out, really.
4963180	4964220	We...
4964220	4965420	They're not gonna believe me.
4965420	4968380	Fallout New Vegas, for me, is...
4968380	4971020	the best game.
4971020	4973260	But for me, it's somehow even more than that.
4973260	4976300	It proved that you could tell a good story and make an amazing world
4976300	4980140	just by actually bothering to design and write and paste it properly.
4980140	4984060	It fixed everything wrong with Fallout 3.
4984060	4985580	Literally everything.
4985580	4989740	I can't even go into detail about all the ways that it improves upon its predecessor,
4989740	4992380	because we're already an hour and twenty minutes in.
4992380	4993900	What else can I even say?
4993900	4994780	I just...
4994780	4998060	There isn't enough time left, and we're gonna eventually have to stop.
4998060	5000780	Just trust me, and give it a shot for yourself.
5000780	5002940	If, for some reason, you haven't played New Vegas,
5002940	5007580	perhaps because you were burned out after playing hours and hours and hours of Fallout 3,
5007580	5010060	maybe now is a good time to give it a shot.
5010060	5012700	Although Fallout 4 just came out, so I bet everyone's burned on that, too.
5012700	5014220	Ugh, whatever.
5014220	5017740	They also seem to have seen the same problems with 3 that I have,
5017740	5021980	at least based on their attitude to it and its fans in the making of documentary.
5021980	5023580	A lot of people like Fallout 3.
5023580	5024540	That little smirk.
5024540	5026300	That's just such a beautiful moment.
5026300	5027340	I'm gonna be honest.
5027340	5031020	The reason why I decided to play New Vegas was because I saw him do that.
5031020	5032140	I saw that smirk.
5032140	5034460	I thought, yeah, he knows.
5034460	5036060	Th- He knows!
5036140	5040060	Josh Sawyer is what would happen if you dipped Todd Howard in the vats.
5040060	5042620	He's- he's just- he's just better!
5043180	5048780	I would do a lot of dark shit to try and get a Fallout 4 New Vegas-type situation happening,
5048780	5053260	but, to be honest, I kind of like the idea of Obsidian doing their own thing.
5053260	5057500	Almost one of the core messages of New Vegas and what it does with the Fallout mythos is
5057500	5060300	show you that it's okay to do things differently,
5060300	5064620	and in a way, it's truer to the spirit of that by letting them just make their own thing,
5064620	5066460	not even having a Fallout name on it.
5067020	5072220	In a way, Black Isle getting shot in the head and Obsidian rising from their grave
5072860	5077660	made them truly free to do whatever they want without being attached to any pre-existing property.
5077660	5080620	Meanwhile, Bethesda's become this franchise zombie,
5080620	5083740	just making more Fallouts and more Elder Scrolls,
5083740	5086940	and- and they published the new Doom and Wolfenstein as well.
5086940	5090620	If you asked me which developers are going to come up with the better, fresher,
5090620	5092460	more interesting and unique ideas,
5093260	5095740	well, you don't need to ask me, it's fucking obvious!
5107660	5112140	You can say what you like, but this, for me, is the defining moment of Fallout 3.
5112860	5116220	It's the most telling portion about the priorities in the game's development,
5116220	5119820	and the most straightforward expression of all its problems and mistakes,
5119820	5121820	and it's about ten seconds of gameplay.
5122780	5125340	You walk into the final chamber with the water purifier.
5125900	5127100	Autumn's here.
5127100	5130780	He plans to kill you with his gun because he wants to, uh,
5131580	5135500	be the guy who has the water purifier that's gonna exist anyway
5135500	5137980	and purify all the water regardless of anything.
5137980	5141260	In the course of three sentences, you talk him down from his desire to do this.
5141260	5143180	He gives up and goes to walk out.
5143820	5146780	On his way, I remember this guy doesn't deserve to walk out of here.
5146780	5148700	I have an obligation to stop him.
5148700	5151100	I killed all his guys, I'm gonna let him go?
5151180	5154220	The guy upon whom this entire conflict can be blamed?
5154220	5158300	The guy who my dad killed himself trying to stop and yet miraculously survived?
5159500	5160380	Fuck that guy!
5160380	5163740	I'm gonna shoot him in the face with a butter knife I stole from his own base!
5167100	5168700	Look at this frame for a moment.
5169420	5175820	The creators of this game modelled the individual 3D pieces of a face exploding.
5175820	5177980	The eyes, the brain, the skull,
5177980	5182940	the fleshy, gooey, splashy matter erupting from a gaping hole in his neck.
5183660	5189340	This is a complex rendition of a head actually being crushed apart into disparate shapes
5189340	5191100	and leaving behind a gory hole.
5191740	5194940	They probably had to look up diagrams and do research for this,
5194940	5197180	model every individual piece,
5197180	5199980	and make sure it spawned correctly where the head once was.
5201180	5205180	They wanted to make sure that when you shot someone in the face with a gun,
5205180	5210700	it exploded in the perfect blend of satisfying, hilarious, and grimly visceral.
5211980	5213740	The character stands for nothing.
5213740	5215100	He turns on a dime.
5215100	5215980	He's flat.
5215980	5218380	He's not written well in any of his appearances.
5218380	5221660	They didn't write a character who you could have a real conversation with.
5221660	5222620	You either say,
5222620	5225340	Time to die, or give up and walk out now, please.
5225980	5229580	The creator's time was apparently better spent on something else.
5231180	5234380	Planet Xbox 360 gave Fallout 3 a 9.8,
5234380	5235100	saying,
5243340	5244700	Presentation.
5244700	5246860	That site now redirects to a clickbait site,
5246860	5251660	because it turns out game reviewers really did at some point get purged the way I said they should earlier.
5251660	5253580	Archive.org saved the site.
5253580	5256860	The review is mostly fluff talking about how many enemies there are to kill,
5256860	5258620	how pretty the blood explosions are,
5258620	5259820	and how cool VATS is,
5259820	5261660	and how much it reminded them of Oblivion.
5261660	5263340	The images are missing from the archive,
5263340	5265020	but it's no big loss.
5265020	5267980	I've seen enough pictures and video from enough other reviews
5267980	5271900	to know there'd probably be more shots from VATS of the player shooting someone else.
5271900	5275580	AKA, slight variations on this frame.
5276140	5278700	The developers spent their time on the presentation.
5279500	5280060	On this.
5280860	5282220	Not on the writing.
5282220	5285820	Not on making you care whose face it was, and why it's exploding.
5286700	5288300	But it doesn't matter now.
5288300	5294940	This un-nuanced, barely even written, confusing-motived man is very definitely dead.
5295980	5297500	But Lyons doesn't think so.
5298060	5300540	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you just let him walk away.
5301340	5301900	Lyons, you—
5302780	5304060	You are not good at this.
5304060	5306540	Go into the water now, please.
5306540	5307100	Just go.
5307100	5307740	Just go—
5307740	5308780	OH GOD!
5308780	5309740	OH GOD!
5318620	5326940	I'd also like to thank Jenny Angel, CavP, Kevin M. Knippy, MK, Malick Malachi-Robinson,
5326940	5332140	Max Scher, Rob Brunt, Simon AJ, and Tom Cameron.
5332140	5334060	I'd also like to apologize.
5334060	5336300	I split the people I was thanking per video in half
5336300	5339260	because I thought I was going to get the other half thanked in this video,
5339260	5341740	and then I went way over the end of the month.
5341740	5343340	Everyone who backed me last month,
5343340	5345020	and everyone who backed me this month,
5345020	5346940	went way over the end of the month.
5346940	5349740	Everyone who backed me last month will get thanked this month
5350460	5352540	in the two videos coming up soon.
5352540	5354220	This one just took a lot longer than I thought,
5354220	5355420	and I had to help with the funeral.
5355420	5356860	It was a whole thing.
5356860	5357820	Next time I do one of these,
5357820	5360540	I kind of want to talk about the philosophy of Dark Souls 2,
5360540	5365980	or why Bloodborne is the best-designed Souls game in terms of introducing it to new players.

5366620	5367660	No, I don't have to do those.
5368220	5369900	Just let me know in the comments which you'd prefer.
5370460	5371900	Or, you know, suggest a new thing.
5371900	5372860	I don't mind.
5372860	5374380	You know, I'm out of ideas.
