00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Oh, God, a bunch of people voted for each video, and I can't be bothered to counter them.

00:05.140 --> 00:06.700
Hold on, I'm just gonna flip a coin.

00:07.460 --> 00:09.460
Oh, fuck. Ugh.

00:10.620 --> 00:13.660
It's gone behind my fucking desk.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.980
Fallout 3 is garbage, and here's why.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.520
♪

00:19.520 --> 00:20.420
♪

00:20.420 --> 00:23.900
The first two Fallouts comprise some of the best games ever.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.260
Virtually nothing else comes close.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.440
Okay, let me be more specific.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.280
Three games come close.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.840
Oh, wait, what's this? Ignore this, forget about that.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.840
And all three of them are made by people who worked on Fallout.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.160
And they're also by companies that no longer really exist.

00:40.560 --> 00:45.720
These types of games are very thin on the ground, and don't ever do as well as they deserve to.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.000
I'm gonna talk about what makes the first two Fallout games good a lot in this video,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.200
but it's important to keep in mind that even without comparisons to the previous games,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.760
Fallout 3 fails on its own merits, too.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.160
In an attempt to remain balanced,

00:59.160 --> 01:03.840
I looked up some reviews by more professional reviewers in the business at the time the game came out.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.600
After carefully perusing as many reviews as I can,

01:06.600 --> 01:09.520
I've isolated three key facts about the game.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.000
Fact one, the VATS system looks totally badass.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.440
No written or video review can shy away from mentioning this and showing you in graphic detail.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.720
Yeah!

01:19.720 --> 01:21.080
Yeah!

01:21.080 --> 01:22.560
Woo!

01:22.560 --> 01:25.080
Oh, oh, oh, murder! Woo!

01:25.080 --> 01:27.080
Yee! Woo!

01:27.080 --> 01:28.520
Yee-juh!

01:28.520 --> 01:29.880
Uh-juh...

01:29.880 --> 01:31.880
Mm-mm-mm...

01:32.840 --> 01:36.240
Mm-mm-mm, VATS is still happening.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.480
This is all footage from one review.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.760
They just kept showing it.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.840
This is all there is of Fallout.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.400
This is the part that people like.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
What about the nuanced storytelling?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.440
Who gives a shit?

01:48.440 --> 01:53.720
Fact two, there are some audiovisual problems on the PS3 version, which also drops frames quite often.

01:53.720 --> 02:00.280
The jagged edges, washed-out lighting, and slightly diminished draw distance of the PS3 release aren't so easy to dismiss.

02:00.280 --> 02:03.400
We also experienced a number of visual bugs on that platform.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.240
And of course, fact three, game reviewers must be purged.

02:07.240 --> 02:12.600
No, seriously, the IGN review of Fallout 3 talks about how fucking deep and intricate the morality system is

02:12.600 --> 02:15.800
and that doing bad things can have dangerous long-lasting effects.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.480
He says this over footage of his character picking up a fork,

02:19.480 --> 02:24.040
and as all the objects on the table bizarrely float around for no reason,

02:24.040 --> 02:28.120
the entire city begins to shoot him to death for theft.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.240
And the game has an awesome climax that we won't spoil for you here.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.200
The IGN reviewer also thinks the ending was good,

02:34.200 --> 02:37.320
the one thing literally everyone disagrees with.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.200
If you think the ending is good, you're actually wrong.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.080
You don't.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.840
That didn't happen. You hated it.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.720
Shut up.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.080
But no matter which system you own, you should play Fallout 3,

02:47.080 --> 02:52.840
which overcomes its issues by offering a deep and involving journey through a world that's hard to forget.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.960
Kevin, you're calling the game deep and involving over footage of you

02:55.960 --> 02:59.000
friendly-firing your fucking allies for no reason.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.840
That guy shows up to help you.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.560
And I had hoped to assist in your rescue.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.440
And he's attacking him just because.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.040
Taking even the briefest glance at the game criticism industry at the time this game came out

03:12.040 --> 03:16.920
reveals it's just a cavalcade of fucking crazy people who think that

03:16.920 --> 03:21.720
do you want to kill a whole town of people or not is a deep question.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.360
Oh my god.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.720
Game journalism is unethical.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.200
The whole thing is a fucking nightmare mess.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.080
So we have to stop them.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.680
We have to stop this.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.080
How can anyone think this about?

03:42.760 --> 03:44.520
In an attempt to present fairness,

03:44.520 --> 03:48.600
I am going to start by listing out some of the things I liked about Fallout 3.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.840
I'm not against the game being turned into an FPS.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.960
A huge portion of the core engine, even though I'm going to complain about it later,

03:53.960 --> 03:57.640
isn't actually all that bad if you strip away the bad things built on top of it.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.520
Fallout 3 has a solid base in there somewhere.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.400
I like that.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.560
I especially like that you can target the weapon in someone's hands and knock it out.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.240
It's a fun strategic move.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.520
If you ever played Perfect Dark and shot a gun out of someone's hand,

04:10.520 --> 04:14.840
it gave you a rush no other game could provide until Fallout 3 had it, which was neat.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.960
I still wish you could go for the eyes, though, like in the originals.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.440
I also wish the AI wasn't fucking terrible.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.400
I guess the other guy's gonna take cover or maybe duck in and out.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.360
Oh no, here he comes.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.440
I am just holding block with the sword I found on the body next to these people.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.480
I could be wrong, but it looks like the sword is hurting them

04:37.480 --> 04:39.720
as much as it's hurting me when they try punching it.

04:40.760 --> 04:41.800
Stand still!

04:41.800 --> 04:42.680
I am!

04:42.680 --> 04:45.560
Yeah, there are some occasionally funny moments or decent bits

04:45.560 --> 04:47.960
mixed in with the garbage we're getting too soon.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.400
The robot assuring you that the bomb is perfectly safe, we promise,

04:51.400 --> 04:54.840
before you even know there's a bomb is pretty impressive as an opener.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.600
And it's an impressive closer for Megaton, too, if you decide to blow it up.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.640
Also, the sniper guarding the town, who you can't reach without cheats

05:09.640 --> 05:10.920
and seems to know this.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.840
Hey, wait a minute.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.160
Megaton's a little different from up here.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.200
What is this?

05:18.200 --> 05:18.920
Morrowind?

05:20.760 --> 05:23.880
The funniest thing in the game is at Raven Rock, the Enclave base.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.600
You'll notice the mess hall floor is a metal grating.

05:26.600 --> 05:30.840
Well, if you go underneath it, you'll find a ton of knives and forks.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.880
People kept dropping them and losing them down the grating.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.560
That's fucking amazing!

05:35.560 --> 05:36.920
It's spectacular!

05:36.920 --> 05:42.360
It's the single humanizing moment the Enclave get in the entire fucking game,

05:42.360 --> 05:43.640
and I love it.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.080
If Fallout 3 consisted entirely of moments like this, it would be the best game ever made.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.280
There are some characters I like.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.160
Not many.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.360
I like Moira.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.240
She's interesting, quirky, has a personality,

05:55.240 --> 06:00.520
and she's probably the character you can have the most varied relationship with.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.680
By which I mean you can do the quest for her and make her happy.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.360
You can do the quest even better and make her happier.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.120
You can crush her dreams by talking her out of her ideas,

06:12.120 --> 06:15.960
or you can nuke her fucking town and then say hi to her later

06:15.960 --> 06:18.600
and carry on as if it didn't happen.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.640
That's almost depth.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.160
I like, um...

06:22.120 --> 06:22.680
What's his name?

06:22.680 --> 06:25.720
I like General Jing Wei from the Operation Anchorage DLC.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.200
He's an incredibly one-dimensional character,

06:28.840 --> 06:32.040
but he is the one permitted one-dimensional character,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.200
unlike all the others in the rest of the game,

06:34.200 --> 06:38.920
because he's literally a racist caricature in a simulation created by Americans

06:38.920 --> 06:41.880
to train soldiers to want to kill Chinese people.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.960
You can literally convince him in one sentence to commit suicide,

06:45.960 --> 06:51.080
which unfortunately isn't far off from how you talk to real characters in the rest of Fallout 3,

06:51.080 --> 06:55.800
but it's still funny because it reminds you how messed up the creators of the simulation were

06:55.800 --> 06:59.640
and how obsessed they thought the Chinese were with honor.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.520
And also the line,

07:00.520 --> 07:03.640
I'm going to kill you so much is pretty funny.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.320
And, um...

07:08.040 --> 07:08.760
That's not it?

07:08.760 --> 07:09.960
Are those all the characters?

07:09.960 --> 07:10.920
Oh, shit, no, wait!

07:10.920 --> 07:11.880
The medic armor!

07:11.880 --> 07:15.240
The medic armor from the basement of old Olney's sewers.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.080
Listen up, you goddamn puke!

07:17.080 --> 07:19.800
You are now wearing prototype medic power armor!

07:19.800 --> 07:21.800
You take care of me, and I'll take care of you!

07:22.680 --> 07:27.480
That's right, I'm stretching the definition of characters purely to complement a game I don't like.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.040
That's how seriously I take being fair on a game.

07:30.040 --> 07:34.200
The medic armor is similarly a remnant of a messed up period in American history,

07:34.200 --> 07:38.360
and when you put it on, it starts yelling at you like a cartoonish drill sergeant.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.560
But even better, it ruins stealth on purpose.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.160
If you're near an enemy, it speaks.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.320
And this attracts enemies.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.720
It literally makes the game harder.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.520
But it's an interesting piece of world building,

07:52.520 --> 07:55.560
and it manages to say something about the culture that built it,

07:55.560 --> 07:59.480
the obnoxiousness of violent American supremacy or whatever.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.880
And, uh, nope.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.240
Nope.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.040
That's it.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.880
So two characters and one talking piece of apparel are good.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.040
And that's it, everybody!

08:10.040 --> 08:13.880
Don't forget to like, rate, and subscribe before you eat shoots and leaves!

08:14.840 --> 08:19.720
But if you want to take a more critical look at the problems with this game's design,

08:19.720 --> 08:25.480
and perhaps whittle the act of playing video games itself to the bare knob of its meaning,

08:25.480 --> 08:26.360
stay right there.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.240
Let's go on an adventure.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.800
4-3 begins with your character's birth.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.240
The vaginal slit dilates—

08:35.240 --> 08:36.040
That's not what it's called.

08:36.040 --> 08:36.600
Hold on a second.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.520
The cervix dilates, and there we are.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.280
The next hour or so is spent making the character,

08:46.280 --> 08:48.920
picking their stats, and learning the dialogue and VATS systems,

08:48.920 --> 08:51.400
up to the point where it's hard to tell what's going on.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.320
It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.120
It's a lot of fun.

08:54.120 --> 08:54.680
It's a lot of fun.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.240
It's a lot of fun.

08:55.240 --> 08:55.880
It's a lot of fun.

08:55.880 --> 08:56.440
It's a lot of fun.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.000
It's a lot of fun.

08:57.000 --> 08:57.560
It's a lot of fun.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.040
It's a lot of fun.

08:58.040 --> 08:58.520
It's a lot of fun.

08:58.520 --> 09:07.320
Let's think about this for a second.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.400
The protagonist's literal birth

09:09.400 --> 09:11.960
is the bad joke answer to the question,

09:11.960 --> 09:13.880
where should our story start?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.680
The other problem with this opening is it's fucking boring!

09:16.680 --> 09:18.920
The stat-picking process takes ages

09:18.920 --> 09:22.120
and corresponds to long scenes of your character growing up,

09:22.120 --> 09:25.240
and nothing major happening and meaningless hijinks

09:25.240 --> 09:27.800
as you learn how to control a first-person video game.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.520
You press the WASD keys to move and use the mouse to—

09:30.520 --> 09:33.640
Are you ready to learn you need to click the mouse to shoot yet?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.720
Sorry, Push Mouse 1?

09:35.720 --> 09:38.760
I dunno, maybe we should fuck around at a birthday party some more.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.360
I genuinely want to know whose idea the opening of the game was.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.640
Give me their name!

09:43.640 --> 09:46.120
The first Bethesda employee to tell me who

09:46.120 --> 09:48.920
came up with the opening sequence set in an enclosed space

09:48.920 --> 09:50.520
you have zero control over

09:50.520 --> 09:52.920
in their action RPG about having freedom

09:52.920 --> 09:55.800
and making meaningful choices gets to live.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.960
But eventually, the game properly starts

09:57.960 --> 10:00.600
and you can finally start acting of your own volition.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.160
Your friend gives you a gun and disappears down the hallway.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.160
And no, that's not a description of how quickly she moves.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.520
She's literally gone.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.840
You grab your stuff and go to follow her.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.360
There he is. Hold it right there!

10:10.360 --> 10:13.560
And it was here, in the first proper room of the game,

10:13.560 --> 10:16.200
that I knew Fallout 3 was going to be a problem.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.880
This is Officer Kendall.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.280
He and all the other cops in the vault beside one

10:20.280 --> 10:22.920
attack you on sight as soon as they see you.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.120
Remember how I just said you can finally act of your own volition?

10:26.120 --> 10:27.240
That was a lie.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.000
You can't initiate dialogue at all.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.640
The roaches that attack him rarely kill him for you.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.720
And once he kills them, he goes hostile on you.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.800
If you try to run away, he'll chase you.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.120
He'll chase you through the entire vault.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.720
He is dedicated to putting his fingers in your eyes.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.480
No, wait, you can't target those anymore.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.440
Your head, then.

10:45.080 --> 10:45.800
Whatever.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.480
You can talk to Budge,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.200
the fucker who's been bullying you your entire life.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.200
In fact, you have no choice not to.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.240
He will chase you down to tell you about his mother.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.520
You gotta help me!

10:56.520 --> 10:58.280
But you can't speak to this guy,

10:58.280 --> 11:01.320
who's been a law-abiding citizen and a nice guy vault cop,

11:01.320 --> 11:03.640
who attended your birthday party.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.640
Butch, fucking Butch,

11:05.640 --> 11:08.760
is allowed to have depth and be treated with a range of options.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.360
You can help him save his mother,

11:10.360 --> 11:12.920
leave her to her fate, or murder him in the head.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.640
This is the closest the game comes to a series of choices,

11:15.640 --> 11:18.840
but the game literally forces you to encounter that choice.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.440
And meanwhile, you don't even get one whatsoever when it comes to Officer Mac.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.760
Is this what Fallout is supposed to be?

11:24.760 --> 11:26.760
A hallway with enemies to shoot?

11:26.760 --> 11:29.080
That sounds fine for your bog standard action game,

11:29.080 --> 11:33.480
but isn't this supposed to be about having the freedom to choose what sort of person you are?

11:33.480 --> 11:36.840
Because now, no matter what sort of person I turn out to be,

11:36.840 --> 11:39.800
I've already shot a man's fucking head off his body!

11:39.800 --> 11:42.520
Officer Kendall isn't the victim of the Lone Wanderer.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.120
He's a victim of bad writing.

11:44.920 --> 11:49.640
Compare and contrast with your first meeting with a hostile human in, say, Fallout 2.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.480
To continue in your quest, you must defeat me in unarmed combat.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.080
Why do we have to fight?

11:55.080 --> 11:58.840
The path of the Chosen One is not an easy trail to walk, H-Bomb.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.400
This challenge prepares you to face another human,

12:01.400 --> 12:02.760
look him in the eyes,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.920
and know that you may have to kill him.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.120
I disagree with you.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.920
I think that a peaceful solution to any problem is possible.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, see you in shit, police officer!

12:13.080 --> 12:15.960
I literally couldn't even attempt a conversation with.

12:15.960 --> 12:20.440
Say hi to your family at your crappy state funeral I had no choice not to cause.

12:20.440 --> 12:25.000
Oh, and it'll be closed, casket, because this is how firearms work!

12:25.000 --> 12:27.720
Officer Park is intestines now!

12:28.280 --> 12:31.400
A lot of games make a big deal out of player choice,

12:31.400 --> 12:36.520
but few in recent memory offer so many intricate ways of approaching any given situation.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.960
There are so many options.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.180
Gun.

12:42.280 --> 12:42.780
Bat.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.060
Oh!

12:46.360 --> 12:47.400
Oh! Knife!

12:49.960 --> 12:53.480
Having a conversation with the human beings in front of you with thoughts and dreams and-

12:58.280 --> 13:02.360
It's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and replaying.

13:03.480 --> 13:03.980
Okay?

13:04.940 --> 13:07.340
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.900
I've come to talk with you again.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.420
If you aren't Butch, this one guard, or the Overseer,

13:17.420 --> 13:22.060
your only meaningful choice is picking which weapon you mash them to death with.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.460
They're treated like the radroaches!

13:24.460 --> 13:27.420
Like I said, the problem with Fallout 3 isn't any one issue.

13:27.420 --> 13:31.660
Having a long sequence where you play as a baby and pick your stats from little books is fine,

13:31.660 --> 13:35.100
but it's this in tandem with the several other long sequences,

13:35.100 --> 13:37.260
the being told how to click a mouse,

13:37.260 --> 13:40.940
the escape sequence where most players unavoidably killed a bunch of cops

13:40.940 --> 13:44.700
because they weren't given any other choices in this game about having freedom of choice.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.100
The character you build is garbage, too!

13:47.100 --> 13:49.260
They took out all the nuance from it.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.540
They took out the trait system, because traits are scary.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.980
For those of you who don't know,

13:53.980 --> 13:57.900
traits in the first two games are special choices with positive and negative downsides,

13:57.900 --> 14:00.860
which you can start the game with that radically alter the game,

14:00.860 --> 14:05.740
like Jinx, which increases the amount of critical failures everyone, including you, can get,

14:05.740 --> 14:09.100
making the game a hilarious mess of constant suffering!

14:09.100 --> 14:11.180
It's how I make almost every character nowadays,

14:11.180 --> 14:14.220
and it adds yet another layer of possibilities to the proceedings,

14:14.220 --> 14:16.860
as enemies and allies blow the weapons out of their hands

14:16.860 --> 14:21.660
and your dog does such a bad job of biting someone that his leg spontaneously breaks!

14:21.660 --> 14:24.540
But who'd want to risk having funny things happen at random,

14:24.540 --> 14:29.100
or cool risk-reward builds for characters who want to specialize in certain types of skills?

14:29.100 --> 14:30.460
That sounds too fun!

14:30.460 --> 14:32.780
And like it would add too much variety,

14:32.780 --> 14:35.260
that would run the risk of making the vault escape sequence

14:35.260 --> 14:37.500
even a little different every time you do it.

14:38.140 --> 14:44.940
And it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and replaying.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.940
Worth playing and replaying, eh, Kevin?

14:46.940 --> 14:48.460
Hmm, I wonder if players agree with you—

14:48.460 --> 14:51.020
No, wait! They modded the opening out!

14:51.020 --> 14:51.980
That's right!

14:51.980 --> 14:56.060
Even players who loved Fallout 3 enough to learn how to make mods for it

14:56.060 --> 14:59.420
think this opening is a heaping pile of garbage trash!

14:59.420 --> 15:03.820
When the game's biggest fans are editing the content out of a game,

15:03.820 --> 15:05.980
that content is probably bad!

15:05.980 --> 15:08.380
Maybe it's wrong of me to harp on the opening so much,

15:08.380 --> 15:09.820
because even at its worst,

15:09.820 --> 15:12.780
it's an hour of boring, repetitive stuff of no consequence,

15:12.780 --> 15:13.980
and then you're done with it.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.140
But it's not that simple, is it?

15:16.140 --> 15:18.860
The sort of people who thought this was an acceptable way

15:18.860 --> 15:21.260
to open their game about freedom and choice

15:21.260 --> 15:22.940
made the rest of the game, too!

15:22.940 --> 15:25.020
Whoever it was whose fault is the opening,

15:25.020 --> 15:29.020
you can see their grubby little piss-stained hands all over the entire game.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.180
So it's worth talking about the opening's problems

15:31.180 --> 15:33.980
because they're a microcosm of Fallout 3 as a whole.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.140
The dad making all the real decisions,

15:36.140 --> 15:37.900
who you're just following around,

15:37.900 --> 15:41.180
and the throwaway characters you won't have any interest in seeing again

15:41.180 --> 15:44.460
all prime you expertly for the shitty game to come.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.460
So if you can call 3's opening anything,

15:47.100 --> 15:49.660
one word you could call it is honest.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.340
Another word would be shite-arse.

15:52.220 --> 15:54.220
Fallout 3's engine is fairly solid,

15:54.220 --> 15:56.700
but its design is terrible!

15:56.700 --> 15:59.740
Now, I know the lockpicking and hacking minigames are often criticized,

15:59.740 --> 16:01.340
but to be honest, I'm okay with them.

16:01.340 --> 16:02.620
But like the rest of Fallout 3,

16:02.620 --> 16:05.660
their potential is squandered because they aren't used well.

16:06.220 --> 16:09.820
Hacking and lockpicking should be a skill your character has to bother to develop,

16:09.820 --> 16:12.300
which is then rewarded in the form of extra loot,

16:12.300 --> 16:14.060
or the ability to alter a situation,

16:14.060 --> 16:16.060
or even bypass a trickier fight.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.820
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.580
But let's look at their actual use in the opening.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.500
To access the Overseer's chamber,

16:23.500 --> 16:27.100
you could pick the very easy, almost impossible-to-fail lock,

16:27.100 --> 16:31.180
or you could open the dresser drawer one room away and take the key.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.020
To access the Overseer's computer,

16:33.020 --> 16:35.100
you could do the hacking minigame,

16:35.100 --> 16:38.540
or you could open the drawer directly next to the computer

16:38.540 --> 16:40.380
and obtain the password directly.

16:40.380 --> 16:43.900
While this is probably done to teach the player that hacking and lockpicking are useful,

16:43.900 --> 16:46.620
but can sometimes be circumvented by resource-worn games,

16:46.620 --> 16:49.580
circumvented by resourcefulness and being aware of your environment,

16:49.580 --> 16:53.580
they impart the far stupider lesson that hacking and lockpicking is pointless,

16:53.580 --> 16:56.060
and you'll be able to skip them incredibly easily.

16:56.060 --> 16:59.900
So, players are ingrained with the belief that these minigames can be avoided,

16:59.900 --> 17:01.980
and you ought to look for ways to do so.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.220
I think that's why people criticize them so much.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.820
Not because they're directly bad,

17:05.820 --> 17:10.140
but because the game itself teaches you that you should avoid doing them if you can.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.060
Even when you do get out of the vault,

17:12.060 --> 17:15.100
Fallout 3's wasteland is big and very pretty at times,

17:15.100 --> 17:19.340
but fails to feel like a world because of some very bad design decisions.

17:19.340 --> 17:23.340
You're simultaneously too free and have no choices.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.540
I know that doesn't make any sense, but we'll get to it, okay? Trust me.

17:26.540 --> 17:27.900
The world is really open.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.180
You can, technically, go anywhere in the world immediately.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.820
The developers seem to have actively wanted this to be the case,

17:33.820 --> 17:35.820
so they designed the world around this.

17:35.820 --> 17:39.100
Consequently, all the areas feel roughly the same.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.620
An open-world shooter can be structured well, like Stalker,

17:42.700 --> 17:45.580
which, for example, put harder and stronger enemies in later areas

17:45.580 --> 17:48.940
because you've become better at playing and found better equipment.

17:48.940 --> 17:53.340
The world is designed so, while you can technically come to harder areas very quickly,

17:53.340 --> 17:58.060
simply getting there requires skills or weaponry you will get your hands on on the way over.

17:58.060 --> 18:02.460
No matter how you play Stalker, the game is arranged so that if you're playing properly,

18:02.460 --> 18:05.500
you're never in a position where you're at a tremendous disadvantage,

18:05.500 --> 18:08.940
and more difficult areas are discouraged by being harder to do early on,

18:08.940 --> 18:10.940
while still being technically doable.

18:11.020 --> 18:14.700
You can assault the army base right next to the start of the game straight away,

18:14.700 --> 18:17.180
but you have to be really good to be able to do it.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.300
This creates a sense of friction and challenge and fun

18:20.300 --> 18:22.620
where the player's ability is being tested.

18:22.620 --> 18:25.420
Assaulting the army base in Stalker is just great.

18:25.420 --> 18:26.220
I love it.

18:26.220 --> 18:28.060
And it's—it's—it's—

18:28.060 --> 18:29.740
AAAAAAHHHHHHHH

18:29.740 --> 18:33.020
Players don't usually think about these elements of games, especially shooters,

18:33.020 --> 18:37.260
but the design of the progression and the pacing is what makes a game fun.

18:37.260 --> 18:41.820
Fallout 3's world is designed for almost every area to be accessible to anyone at any time.

18:41.820 --> 18:45.980
This means that the developers had to avoid making an area the player could go too early,

18:45.980 --> 18:49.900
which let me remind you is anywhere, too hard, so most—

18:49.900 --> 18:55.180
no, let's be honest, all enemies and characters in the game have fairly low-quality equipment and stats,

18:55.180 --> 18:59.820
and no lockpicks or hacking minigames in your path require much skill to activate.

18:59.820 --> 19:03.980
This practically eliminates any sense of pace or rising action or difficulty.

19:03.980 --> 19:07.820
Once you've dealt with a couple of packs of raiders and leveled up just a little,

19:07.820 --> 19:10.940
or if you stopped off at Moira's for the rocket launcher early on,

19:10.940 --> 19:15.260
90% of the game is a splashy meat fest where nothing could really challenge you,

19:15.260 --> 19:17.740
rendering almost the entire game dull.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.980
A good game is like a three-course meal.

19:19.980 --> 19:23.180
You have your salad, your main, and your dessert.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.420
Fallout 3 is one massive salad,

19:25.420 --> 19:30.700
and you only need to have a little bit of salad before you wish the waiter would bring you your fucking spaghetti!

19:30.700 --> 19:35.020
A ton of popular gameplay mods for Fallout 3 make the game harder in various ways,

19:35.020 --> 19:37.660
with more realistic weapon damage, or harder enemies,

19:37.660 --> 19:40.780
or adding more mechanics the player has to deal with to survive,

19:40.780 --> 19:42.380
and this is because past a certain point,

19:42.380 --> 19:45.900
you're gonna need that stuff for the game to be challenging in the slightest.

19:45.900 --> 19:49.820
Once again, modders are having to do the developers' jobs for them.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.940
The most popular of these, Fallout 3 Wanderer's Edition,

19:52.940 --> 19:55.420
also adds the ability to skip the opening,

19:55.420 --> 19:57.420
because of course it would!

19:57.420 --> 20:00.940
Whoever designed this mod should have made Fallout 3!

20:00.940 --> 20:03.980
The place where you should be able to expect the enemies and their skills,

20:03.980 --> 20:07.020
weapons, and armor to really get more difficult is the main story,

20:07.020 --> 20:10.140
but the developers had no way of knowing what level the player would be

20:10.140 --> 20:11.500
when they were doing the main story,

20:11.500 --> 20:13.580
and wanted to make sure players didn't get stuck,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.180
so once the Enclave turn up,

20:15.180 --> 20:18.380
not only do they engage you in small enough numbers that they're not a problem,

20:18.380 --> 20:19.900
even at quite a low level,

20:19.900 --> 20:22.860
but once you encounter them in greater numbers close to the climax,

20:22.860 --> 20:25.660
there's invariably something else shooting at them for you,

20:25.660 --> 20:28.140
like Liberty Prime, or the Brotherhood of Steel,

20:28.140 --> 20:30.860
or Forks, or the turrets in the Enclave base.

20:30.860 --> 20:33.420
So even the hard enemies aren't hard.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.340
Well, at least the robots are having a fun combat experience here.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.940
It's possible to beat a huge portion of the larger set pieces

20:44.940 --> 20:46.380
without firing a single shot,

20:46.380 --> 20:48.700
because your allies are invincible and overpowered

20:48.700 --> 20:50.780
in order to make sure the plot gets pushed forward.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.300
In fact, in the final mission,

20:52.300 --> 20:53.980
if you're a melee weapons character,

20:53.980 --> 20:56.540
the real challenge is to kill anyone yourself,

20:56.540 --> 20:59.500
so you're totally free to take part in the game's story,

20:59.500 --> 21:03.740
but don't ever have any influence over it in terms of story or gameplay.

21:04.140 --> 21:07.740
So in other words, you're too free and have no choices.

21:07.740 --> 21:09.740
Do you get it? It all made sense.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.780
There are a couple of areas that are suddenly very difficult.

21:12.780 --> 21:16.780
For example, the old Olney Sewers I mentioned before are a nightmare mess.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.700
The deathclaws are really powerful,

21:18.700 --> 21:21.580
making the area the most challenging one in the entire game,

21:21.580 --> 21:24.300
and literally impossible if you went to it early on.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.700
The reward is a suit of power armor that's no better

21:26.700 --> 21:28.940
than the armor you'd need to be wearing to get to it,

21:28.940 --> 21:30.700
which, by the way, is still overpowered

21:30.700 --> 21:33.180
for the entirety of the rest of Fallout 3's world.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.780
If you're gonna have an area like this,

21:34.780 --> 21:37.500
you should probably put it somewhere only late-game players can get to

21:37.500 --> 21:39.100
so they don't get murdered over and over

21:39.100 --> 21:41.020
expecting it to be like the rest of the game,

21:41.020 --> 21:43.100
but no, it's just sitting there.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.140
Worse off, it's not even leveled to the areas around it.

21:46.140 --> 21:49.900
Right next to it, further away from where you start the game,

21:49.900 --> 21:51.500
is the Republic of Dave,

21:51.740 --> 21:55.260
It's a fun little area with its own, like, weird democracy thing going on,

21:55.260 --> 21:56.860
but there's only five characters in it.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.140
It's really fun.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.060
The Republic of Dave is, like Olney,

22:00.060 --> 22:02.780
one of the few truly cool areas in the game,

22:02.780 --> 22:06.220
but they're the two areas that shouldn't be right next to each other!

22:06.220 --> 22:08.780
They should be on opposite sides of the map!

22:08.780 --> 22:11.180
These areas are two of my three favorites in the game,

22:11.180 --> 22:15.100
and they're both shoved off to the side right next to each other like an afterthought.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.580
A game that properly paced itself would arrange its map

22:17.580 --> 22:19.900
so you encountered the latter very early on,

22:19.900 --> 22:22.060
and the former much, much later,

22:22.060 --> 22:24.140
when, in fact, the opposite happens.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.300
Speaking of badly thought-out gameplay,

22:26.300 --> 22:28.460
thanks to the poor visual design and writing,

22:28.460 --> 22:30.940
it's often very difficult to know how to get somewhere

22:30.940 --> 22:32.380
once you decide where you want to go,

22:32.380 --> 22:35.260
or what exactly to do when you're doing a quest.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.340
The world is so big and full of junk that,

22:37.340 --> 22:40.140
for most of the game, if you're doing a story or optional quest,

22:40.140 --> 22:43.020
you can't rely on the game to tell you where to head visually.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.340
You have to look at the arrow on your radar.

22:45.340 --> 22:51.020
And down here is the biggest travesty in the history of video games.

22:51.020 --> 22:53.180
Okay, it's not that bad, but it's pretty bad.

22:53.180 --> 22:57.580
A good game can tell you where to go effortlessly through the design of its levels,

22:57.580 --> 23:01.500
or by giving you enough directions that you can put the pieces together yourself.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.860
This is good because it encourages the player to be aware of their surroundings,

23:04.860 --> 23:07.820
which lets them fully appreciate the worlds the designers have built

23:07.820 --> 23:09.820
and all the neat personal touches to it.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.780
When you build a world centered around giving them a blip on their radar

23:12.780 --> 23:14.780
to walk towards in a straight line,

23:14.780 --> 23:17.820
you hamstring not just their own sense of going on their own journey

23:17.820 --> 23:19.820
and making their own decisions,

23:19.820 --> 23:24.140
but you've created a situation where the game is teaching you to follow this with your brain.

23:24.140 --> 23:28.700
Your eyes are trained to follow it, to stare at it, to just go where it tells you to.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.460
The levels can be often quite nice-looking, with fun little things to look at,

23:32.460 --> 23:35.100
but your eyes are here at all times.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.260
You probably didn't even notice you were doing it,

23:37.260 --> 23:40.140
but the game's objective marker slowly turns you into an idiot

23:40.140 --> 23:42.220
with no awareness of your surroundings.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.220
Here's a review from 2014.

23:44.380 --> 23:47.420
Also, like, stuff like, you thought Liberty Prime was sick.

23:47.420 --> 23:50.140
I thought it was awesome because he was there the whole time

23:50.140 --> 23:51.660
and you never paid attention to him.

23:51.660 --> 23:55.020
Liberty Prime is a gigantic fucking robot!

23:55.020 --> 23:57.180
You have a bunch of opportunities to see it.

23:57.180 --> 24:00.780
You cannot avoid seeing it when you walk into the room!

24:00.780 --> 24:03.260
It is literally impossible!

24:03.260 --> 24:06.140
And yet, somehow, these players missed it

24:06.140 --> 24:10.140
until it was the thing you were following for the last quest as it did all the work.

24:10.140 --> 24:13.020
I'm not calling these guys stupid, they're pretty funny and smart.

24:13.020 --> 24:16.220
I'm saying Fallout 3 is so stupid by design

24:16.220 --> 24:20.540
that it teaches players not to notice things that are otherwise quite easy just to look at

24:20.540 --> 24:23.740
and see with your human eyes!

24:23.740 --> 24:26.700
In previous Fallouts, if you don't have your wits about you,

24:26.700 --> 24:28.700
you're not gonna see what you need to see.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.260
It trained you to develop an awareness of your surroundings,

24:31.260 --> 24:35.260
and thus, A, make you feel awesome when you figure out a way of doing things

24:35.260 --> 24:38.540
that wasn't obvious or literally just told to you by the game,

24:38.540 --> 24:40.780
it made you feel like you'd solved a puzzle,

24:40.780 --> 24:44.380
and B, it gave you an appreciation of the design of the world.

24:44.380 --> 24:47.420
Remember the forks under the mess hall in the Enclave base?

24:47.420 --> 24:50.780
How many players do you think noticed that or realized why?

24:50.780 --> 24:54.780
This is an uncharacteristically cool and funny and human piece of world-building,

24:54.780 --> 24:58.380
but the game was seemingly designed around making sure you don't see it

24:58.380 --> 25:00.220
because you're too busy looking at this,

25:00.220 --> 25:02.700
the one thing telling you where you're supposed to go.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.420
I remember in the other Fallout games and Planescape Torment

25:05.420 --> 25:07.580
getting given strict directions like

25:07.580 --> 25:10.540
go down the street and take the second left to get to my friend's house.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.300
You have to navigate a street.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.740
At one point in Fallout 2,

25:13.740 --> 25:15.980
a guy gives you directions to some buried treasure,

25:15.980 --> 25:16.940
and guess what?

25:16.940 --> 25:18.220
He lies.

25:18.220 --> 25:21.340
You have to navigate the world based on some guy's advice,

25:21.340 --> 25:23.180
which might not even be honest.

25:23.180 --> 25:26.140
There wasn't an arrow constantly pointing at your destination.

25:26.140 --> 25:30.460
Conversely, turning this arrow off would render many quests impossible

25:30.460 --> 25:34.220
because figuring out what you have to do and where without this guide

25:34.220 --> 25:36.860
just isn't something the game is equipped to do.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.700
In order to progress the main story,

25:38.700 --> 25:41.100
you have to pick up this tape.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.300
So without the arrow pointing you directly to it,

25:44.300 --> 25:45.740
how would you ever find it?

25:45.740 --> 25:47.420
It's in a giant base.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.620
The Elder Scrolls games, also by Bethesda, have this problem too,

25:50.620 --> 25:52.940
and worst off, Morrowind, the ancient one,

25:52.940 --> 25:54.780
is the one that doesn't have this problem.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.780
The game left navigation to the player,

25:56.780 --> 25:58.700
and it resulted in a better world.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.500
I haven't finished any of the last three Elder Scrolls games,

26:01.500 --> 26:03.180
but I stuck with Morrowind the longest

26:03.180 --> 26:05.500
because it felt like my adventure,

26:05.500 --> 26:07.980
not an adventure someone else wrote for me,

26:08.060 --> 26:11.020
and certainly not an adventure someone else wrote for a different character

26:11.020 --> 26:12.860
that I'm just sort of there for.

26:12.860 --> 26:15.900
One area of the main story, Vault 87,

26:15.900 --> 26:17.740
doesn't give you a place to go.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.780
You have to look around a big facility to find the GECK,

26:20.780 --> 26:21.740
and guess what?

26:21.740 --> 26:24.860
It's by far one of the most interesting areas of the game

26:24.860 --> 26:27.740
because it had to be designed to lead you where you should look

26:27.740 --> 26:29.100
through sheer design

26:29.100 --> 26:32.460
instead of offering very little in terms of direction or world building

26:32.460 --> 26:35.100
and relying on a heads-up display with an arrow on it.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.820
This forces you to become more aware of your surroundings

26:37.820 --> 26:40.060
and causes you to appreciate the game more.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.500
It's a breath of fresh air.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.700
You notice little things,

26:42.700 --> 26:46.380
like how the mutants keep a leaf blower on the shelf next to the meat.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.820
That's not sanitary.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.260
Meanwhile, in the rest of the game,

26:49.260 --> 26:52.140
players don't notice the giant fucking robot

26:52.140 --> 26:54.940
because they're too busy following arrows to objectives.

26:54.940 --> 26:59.180
Vault 87 is like an intrusion from an alternate reality version of Fallout 3

26:59.180 --> 27:01.100
that was really, really good.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.780
It's also the one place in the game where you can actually talk to a mutant.

27:04.780 --> 27:06.860
Imagine if you could do that with more of them.

27:06.860 --> 27:08.380
But it's not just the way you're led around

27:08.380 --> 27:10.780
or the poor visual design of the world, no.

27:10.780 --> 27:13.180
Fallout 3 is geometrically wrong,

27:13.180 --> 27:14.540
and we're gonna show our working.

27:14.540 --> 27:15.980
Have you packed your protractor?

27:15.980 --> 27:17.980
Because I didn't, can I borrow yours?

27:17.980 --> 27:21.980
In open-world games, players can theoretically go anywhere right away,

27:21.980 --> 27:24.300
but designers, at least decent ones,

27:24.300 --> 27:26.220
do their best to set out a path

27:26.220 --> 27:28.620
and give you a sense of direction and progression.

27:28.620 --> 27:30.620
This applies also to side quests.

27:30.620 --> 27:33.980
While optional content that doesn't affect the main story is fine,

27:34.060 --> 27:37.260
there are good and bad ways to put this stuff into the player's view.

27:37.260 --> 27:39.660
In Fallout 1, when you're looking for the water chip,

27:39.660 --> 27:42.140
you start off with literally one thing on your map,

27:42.140 --> 27:43.180
just like in 3.

27:43.180 --> 27:46.700
We marked your map with the location of another vault.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.860
Not a bad place to start, I think.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.620
So, you head in this direction.

27:51.980 --> 27:53.420
But what's this?

27:53.420 --> 27:54.060
That's right.

27:54.060 --> 27:57.660
On your direct path to your objective is Shady Sands,

27:57.660 --> 27:59.500
the first populated area.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.940
Do you see what the game's done here?

28:00.940 --> 28:03.020
The game has given you one place to go,

28:03.020 --> 28:05.900
but on your direct route, it's offered you another one.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.260
You could go wherever you want,

28:07.260 --> 28:09.420
wander around, prance off into the wastes.

28:09.420 --> 28:13.660
In fact, you could go to one of the last areas in the game by just walking left.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.140
But with just this one location,

28:16.140 --> 28:18.540
you've actually been shown two places to go.

28:18.540 --> 28:21.580
On top of that, you actually can't get into the vault without a rope.

28:21.580 --> 28:24.620
Luckily, you now know of somewhere where you might find one.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.180
No objective marker needs to pop up to let you

28:27.180 --> 28:31.020
know you need to find a rope with an arrow floating over the people who can sell you one.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.340
You go there, you see you need one,

28:33.340 --> 28:35.180
and then it's up to you to find it.

28:35.820 --> 28:39.500
This establishes a very important narrative and thematic throughline.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.900
You're told to do something or go somewhere,

28:41.900 --> 28:44.220
but doing that isn't so straightforward.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.460
You have to be resourceful to make things work.

28:46.460 --> 28:47.740
The game is saying,

28:47.740 --> 28:50.380
what you have to do is not going to be obvious.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.580
Use your head.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.020
This is capped off by how,

28:53.020 --> 28:56.700
once you do get a rope and descend to the bottom of Vault 15,

28:56.700 --> 28:59.180
you find the lower levels have been completely destroyed,

28:59.180 --> 29:01.340
and you're going to have to search elsewhere.

29:01.340 --> 29:05.260
So the only instruction you've been given leads to a dead end.

29:05.260 --> 29:09.020
None of the people in Shady Sands have probably ever seen a computer in their lives.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.740
You have to find your own leads from here on out.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.340
The game doesn't hold your hand,

29:13.340 --> 29:18.220
but it nudges useful options into your path for you to work with as you see fit.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.420
Now it's just you,

29:19.420 --> 29:20.300
the wasteland,

29:20.300 --> 29:22.300
and, hopefully, somewhere,

29:22.300 --> 29:23.100
a water chip.

29:23.660 --> 29:26.700
Finding out where one is and figuring out how to get it

29:26.700 --> 29:29.580
forms the basis of the entire first half of the game.

29:29.580 --> 29:32.700
It's a free-form journey you venture on yourself.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.860
Compare and contrast with the search for your dad,

29:34.860 --> 29:37.900
where there's always an objective marker pointing to your next breadcrumb,

29:37.900 --> 29:39.420
which will tell you where to go next,

29:39.420 --> 29:41.020
marked on your radar, of course,

29:41.020 --> 29:42.140
until you find him.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.860
There's no actual adventuring for the player to do.

29:44.860 --> 29:48.780
I think this is why a lot of players ignore the story for a lot of their time playing the game.

29:48.780 --> 29:53.100
The story is so unengaging and requires so little effort or thought on your part

29:53.100 --> 29:55.340
that your brain sort of slides off it,

29:55.420 --> 29:58.700
and you go off to mess about with Tenpenny Tower or those vampire guys,

29:58.700 --> 30:01.420
or just wander around listening to the radio.

30:01.420 --> 30:04.620
Fallout 1 always makes you feel like you're the hero on a journey

30:04.620 --> 30:08.140
by straightforwardly putting the onus on the player to connect the dots

30:08.140 --> 30:12.060
while handing you places to look in an order of increasing complexity and danger

30:12.060 --> 30:14.940
based on where players are most likely to go next in their mission.

30:14.940 --> 30:18.140
It's free-form, and yet it's also subtly structured.

30:18.140 --> 30:20.140
You're always searching for the water chip,

30:20.140 --> 30:24.620
always on your guard for someone who might happen to be able to help put some pieces of the puzzle together,

30:24.620 --> 30:27.660
and when side quests happen, they're also engaging,

30:27.660 --> 30:30.780
and they're introduced in an organic, entertaining way.

30:30.780 --> 30:33.180
For example, after you've discovered Vault 15's wrecked,

30:33.180 --> 30:35.660
you remember a guy you talked to mentioning trade caravans

30:35.660 --> 30:38.460
that carry water to and from several towns and cities.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.820
So you check out Junk Town.

30:39.820 --> 30:43.420
On the way into the town proper, you hear this guy called Killian is the town's sheriff,

30:43.420 --> 30:47.260
and there's a dude called Gizmo who runs a casino and does crime things.

30:47.260 --> 30:50.460
I go see Killian, who is like a shopkeeper as well as a sheriff,

30:50.460 --> 30:52.700
which is a little weird and control-y,

30:52.780 --> 30:54.300
but he seems nice enough.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.540
Oh, I think I already have.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.700
While he doesn't know anything about the chip or vaults

31:00.700 --> 31:05.020
and actively gets annoyed by vault dwellers who live lives of safety and complacency,

31:05.020 --> 31:09.020
he seems like a nice person and has stuff to sell that can help you out.

31:09.020 --> 31:11.020
Then a guy comes in and tries to murder him.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.780
Holy shi- I'm right here!

31:12.780 --> 31:14.860
I've looked into his dreamy eyes!

31:14.860 --> 31:16.140
You can't do that!

31:16.140 --> 31:17.500
Obviously you help out.

31:19.820 --> 31:20.860
Then Killian's like,

31:20.860 --> 31:22.300
we know Gizmo's behind this,

31:22.300 --> 31:25.500
but we're Law & Order-type guys, so we have to follow procedure.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.220
Next thing you know, you're wiretapping Gizmo's office

31:28.220 --> 31:32.060
or getting him to confess to wanting to murder Killian into a tape recorder.

31:32.060 --> 31:35.180
So, will you do it for me?

31:35.180 --> 31:37.020
Oh yeah, I sure will.

31:37.740 --> 31:40.140
Wait, do you see what the game's done?

31:40.140 --> 31:43.420
You've reached a point where you're pulling classic cop show hijinks,

31:43.420 --> 31:48.540
and it all happened completely organically from walking into a store to ask about the water chip.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.740
It's badass!

31:49.740 --> 31:52.700
And the side quest is not only entertaining and fun side content,

31:52.700 --> 31:55.100
but despite being technically totally optional,

31:55.100 --> 31:58.780
the game almost forces you to get involved from how it introduces it to you.

31:58.780 --> 32:02.940
There isn't just an optional dialogue choice where you ask Killian if he has any side quests,

32:02.940 --> 32:07.500
and he's like, yeah, maybe go to a place and shoot some guys and bring me back a MacGuffin.

32:07.500 --> 32:12.060
You get involved with the story of this town simply in the process of walking into it.

32:12.060 --> 32:16.780
Junk Town and Junk Town's completely optional additions to the game are peak game design

32:16.780 --> 32:19.340
because they present themselves to you naturally.

32:19.340 --> 32:22.860
Fallout, despite being made in the 90s before games went mainstream

32:22.860 --> 32:25.260
and simplified themselves for a wider audience,

32:25.260 --> 32:27.980
is incredibly good at getting people into it.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.860
That's why it's so beloved by so many people.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.500
Let's contrast with the first town in Fallout 3.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.780
You go to Megaton because your game's objective marker tells you to.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.220
You walk into a bar and a man says,

32:38.220 --> 32:40.860
I knew your dad and I'll tell you where to go if you do a thing for me.

32:40.860 --> 32:43.980
But if you hack his computer or talk to his employee for five seconds,

32:43.980 --> 32:45.580
you don't need to do that at all.

32:45.580 --> 32:48.380
The most freedom you have in your journey to see your dad

32:48.380 --> 32:52.060
is how much pointless busywork for other people you have to do.

32:52.060 --> 32:56.460
Instead of the options put in your path being different rewards for different actions,

32:56.460 --> 32:59.580
most of the rewards are how much side content you want to skip.

32:59.580 --> 33:02.140
After that, you go to Galaxy News Radio and see Three Dog

33:02.140 --> 33:04.140
because that's what the objective marker says,

33:04.140 --> 33:06.620
and then eventually Three Dog tells you he knows where your dad went.

33:06.620 --> 33:09.020
But first, would you like to do an optional quest for me?

33:09.900 --> 33:11.900
No? Okay, well, he went to Rivet City.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.060
All right, so you go to Rivet City.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.420
They say he went somewhere else.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.020
You go there, you clear out the mutants there,

33:17.020 --> 33:18.140
your objective marker tells you—

33:18.140 --> 33:19.980
If you are worried about the story, don't be.

33:19.980 --> 33:21.580
It's very well-structured and focused.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.940
And then you go there and blah blah blah,

33:22.940 --> 33:25.580
you're still following this one fucking guy's trail.

33:25.580 --> 33:30.060
Which brings me to the game's biggest single narrative and gameplay problem.

33:30.060 --> 33:33.020
The main character is never the main character.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.180
Your dad is the main character for most of it,

33:35.180 --> 33:37.100
doing his own thing for his own reasons.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.020
All the game's truly big decisions—

33:39.020 --> 33:41.740
the decision to abandon his life's work and raise his son,

33:41.740 --> 33:43.580
the decision to leave and try again,

33:43.580 --> 33:46.940
the decision to kill himself in order to prevent the Enclave from taking over—

33:46.940 --> 33:51.500
you spend too much of this game watching your dad have a much more intricate story.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.980
So, uh, I'm Warsaw here.

33:53.980 --> 33:54.540
It's time.

33:54.540 --> 33:55.900
God damn it, Janice!

33:55.900 --> 33:59.340
What did I tell you about walking to tables in the middle of a fucking cutscene?

33:59.340 --> 34:01.420
The real main characters are talking here!

34:01.420 --> 34:03.020
But even when your dad dies,

34:03.020 --> 34:06.700
you're not left to pick up the pieces and make things work for yourself.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.540
Dr. Li immediately takes over

34:08.540 --> 34:10.780
and starts giving you the orders for where to go next.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.380
We've got to evacuate now.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.380
Don't wander off. We're going to need you.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.060
Jeez, Madison, you don't have to be rude.

34:16.060 --> 34:17.500
I'm standing right here.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.700
This guy knows what's up.

34:19.260 --> 34:21.020
Or he knows something.

34:22.140 --> 34:22.940
Are you all right?

34:23.500 --> 34:24.000
Mate?

34:24.620 --> 34:26.780
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

34:28.060 --> 34:30.140
Here she is convincing the Brotherhood to let you in.

34:30.940 --> 34:31.740
Lions!

34:31.740 --> 34:32.780
I know you're in there!

34:32.780 --> 34:33.740
I know you can hear me!

34:33.740 --> 34:35.820
You open this goddamn door right now!

34:35.820 --> 34:37.260
I guess I'm also here.

34:37.260 --> 34:38.620
I'm—I'm the player, but we—

34:39.500 --> 34:41.820
And then, when the time finally comes

34:41.820 --> 34:44.300
to take back the memorial and kick the Enclave out,

34:44.300 --> 34:46.940
who gives the triumphant speeches and leads the charge?

34:46.940 --> 34:47.900
Not you!

34:47.900 --> 34:48.940
When we're done with this,

34:48.940 --> 34:51.740
everyone can have a nice cold glass of water on me.

34:51.740 --> 34:52.860
Pry, move out!

34:53.500 --> 34:54.860
Hey, guys, how's it going?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.220
I literally can't even move.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.660
I have to watch this play out exactly how the developers want it to.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.620
The biggest effect you can have on the final mission is

35:02.620 --> 35:04.620
if you bring an ally in with you,

35:04.620 --> 35:08.140
Lions can't get past them when it takes longer for them to get out of the room.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.060
The final mission is you walking in a straight line,

35:10.060 --> 35:12.620
assisted by the Brotherhood as they kill everyone for you,

35:12.620 --> 35:15.500
and you're all following a robot as he kills everyone else.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.860
I spent a huge portion of this mission trying to score kills of my own,

35:18.860 --> 35:20.380
and I think I got about three.

35:20.940 --> 35:23.180
Oh, come on, guys, no kill-stealing.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.540
That's just rude.

35:24.540 --> 35:28.940
So, apart from a few brief flashes of brilliance like Vault 87,

35:28.940 --> 35:33.260
the entire main story the developers wrote for their game is total garbo,

35:33.260 --> 35:35.660
and barely even actually qualifies as a story.

35:35.740 --> 35:39.820
You're basically a camera with legs who watches a story happen at you.

35:39.820 --> 35:44.140
This makes the player constantly aware that they aren't really taking part in a story.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.620
They're just playing a video game.

35:46.620 --> 35:49.100
Like, I can already imagine an angry comment saying,

35:49.100 --> 35:52.460
He's complaining that people are treating the game like a game, lol!

35:52.460 --> 35:54.060
But bear with me here.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.060
Games, especially role-playing games,

35:56.060 --> 35:59.260
are focused on creating a sense of not simply being in a game,

35:59.260 --> 36:02.140
but of being immersed in an interactive story.

36:02.140 --> 36:06.140
They're emergent from tabletop games like D&D, or in Fallout's case, GURPS.

36:06.140 --> 36:10.220
If someone invited you to their weekly sessions set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland,

36:10.220 --> 36:13.500
and the story was not only weirdly railroady where your character's dad,

36:13.500 --> 36:15.900
who was immortal until his heroic sacrifice,

36:15.900 --> 36:19.100
and some lady in power armor and her pals did all the real work,

36:19.100 --> 36:21.420
and the only way to interact with the other stories in the world

36:21.420 --> 36:25.180
is to ask where the side quests are because you aren't introduced to them organically,

36:25.180 --> 36:27.900
you're not really going to be having a good time, are you?

36:27.900 --> 36:30.060
Core concept? Bottom line?

36:30.060 --> 36:35.420
Fallout 3 fails as an RPG because it fails to make you feel like a person in a world.

36:35.420 --> 36:37.340
What does Fallout 3 have to make up for it?

36:37.340 --> 36:39.340
Well, that's easy. The rocket launcher.

36:41.020 --> 36:43.820
This weapon was touted hugely before it came out.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.300
A physics gun that shoots stuff at people.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.180
How fun!

36:47.180 --> 36:48.780
I'm not saying the rocket launcher's bad.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.420
It's not an inherently stupid thing to add to a game,

36:51.420 --> 36:55.740
but is it the sort of thing you should be adding to your game before the writing,

36:55.740 --> 36:57.820
or storytelling, or game design?

36:57.820 --> 36:59.500
One last big design problem.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.660
Speech as a concept.

37:01.660 --> 37:03.980
Fallout 3 broke it.

37:03.980 --> 37:08.460
In the first two games, dialogue had a lot of sneaky behind-the-scenes stuff going on.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.700
If your character wasn't smart enough to know something,

37:10.700 --> 37:12.940
you couldn't say it in a conversation,

37:12.940 --> 37:15.180
and even then, if you didn't have high enough speech,

37:15.180 --> 37:17.900
the smarter, more convincing options weren't available.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.140
You didn't even see you could make them,

37:20.140 --> 37:24.140
and when they were available, you had to actively choose them yourself.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.660
You were shown a list of options,

37:25.660 --> 37:27.980
and it was up to you to discern what the best,

37:27.980 --> 37:31.500
most persuasive thing to say might be to the character in question.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.140
It was subtle, and awesome.

37:34.140 --> 37:37.100
As always, Fallout 3 ruined everything.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.220
For one thing, they're always openly visible to any player.

37:40.220 --> 37:42.380
No longer is having high speech a nice surprise

37:42.380 --> 37:45.740
that either causes a cool new option to open up and surprise you,

37:45.740 --> 37:49.100
or a backing thing adding to your list of possible options.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.500
The high speech options are always just sitting there,

37:51.500 --> 37:54.060
unsubtle as a gun that shoots junk.

37:54.060 --> 37:56.940
Furthermore, it's not a simple test of your character's skill levels,

37:56.940 --> 37:59.420
or player ability to decide the best answer,

37:59.420 --> 38:02.620
but rather a percentage dice roll based on your skill.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.620
It even tells you the percentage,

38:04.620 --> 38:07.420
so you can specialize in speech but not roll properly,

38:07.420 --> 38:09.980
or someone else who didn't bother gets lucky with it,

38:09.980 --> 38:11.820
or you can just reload over and over,

38:11.820 --> 38:15.740
which completely defeats the point of having speech checks at all.

38:15.740 --> 38:19.420
Cumulatively, this is a huge problem for the game as a whole.

38:19.420 --> 38:22.300
Conversation is the fundamental medium

38:22.300 --> 38:25.100
through which you experience the Fallout universe,

38:25.100 --> 38:27.580
and the speech ability is perhaps the most useful

38:27.580 --> 38:30.700
and unique thing Fallout ever brought to the table.

38:30.700 --> 38:34.780
Messing this up this badly is a GAME CRIME.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.860
Even without relating to the previous games,

38:36.860 --> 38:39.100
it makes this world feel like it's made of tissue paper,

38:39.100 --> 38:41.020
where if I pass a dice roll,

38:41.020 --> 38:43.180
I can totally alter a person's worldview.

38:43.180 --> 38:45.340
It's unsubtle and completely ill-fitting

38:45.340 --> 38:47.340
for a game series ostensibly based around

38:47.340 --> 38:49.900
the nuanced frictions between people.

38:49.900 --> 38:52.540
Now let's talk briefly about the weapon degradation system.

38:53.420 --> 38:54.060
It's bad.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.540
No, wait, that's not fair. I'll explain why.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.540
Okay, so I can see what they're going for.

39:00.540 --> 39:03.580
There's quite a good deal of thought going into the system and their execution,

39:03.580 --> 39:05.580
but like with the way the main quest plays out

39:05.580 --> 39:08.060
and the general landmarkless look of the Wasteland,

39:08.060 --> 39:10.060
it isn't quite done right.

39:10.060 --> 39:13.500
The idea is that your weapons are old and breaking and need to be repaired,

39:13.500 --> 39:14.860
not just to continue working,

39:14.860 --> 39:17.020
but because their condition affects their damage.

39:17.100 --> 39:20.300
A fully functioning pistol is better than one that's falling apart.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.780
You have a repair stat that allows you to take two of a weapon

39:22.780 --> 39:24.860
and turn them into one better weapon,

39:24.860 --> 39:26.380
but you need to get your stat higher

39:26.380 --> 39:28.860
to get things beyond a certain quality threshold.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.860
This means that as your character progresses,

39:30.860 --> 39:33.820
you don't just get stronger by having more points in guns,

39:33.820 --> 39:36.140
but you also end up with higher quality weapons

39:36.140 --> 39:38.380
that improve your damage output even further.

39:38.380 --> 39:39.980
This, so far, is fine.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.300
But there's another layer of design

39:42.300 --> 39:44.860
that has to go into the game when you add this system in.

39:44.860 --> 39:49.020
Since weapons break and can't be used until they're repaired if they hit zero condition,

39:49.020 --> 39:52.300
the developers can put more powerful weapons in early game areas

39:52.300 --> 39:55.100
in order to give you a taste of the direction the game's gonna go,

39:55.100 --> 39:58.060
or give you something powerful but that you can only use a few times

39:58.060 --> 40:00.460
so you can save it for more difficult moments.

40:00.460 --> 40:03.500
So, lots of powerful weapons can be discovered early on

40:03.500 --> 40:05.260
and give you a taste of things to come,

40:05.260 --> 40:06.780
but have to be used sparingly.

40:08.140 --> 40:08.640
Wait.

40:09.180 --> 40:10.540
Can you see the contradiction here?

40:11.580 --> 40:14.460
Powerful weapons being given to you early in low condition

40:14.460 --> 40:15.980
because they can't be used too much,

40:16.860 --> 40:20.220
and weapons that get weaker when they're in lower condition?

40:21.420 --> 40:23.660
These two things don't go well together.

40:23.660 --> 40:25.580
This means that the game ends up handing you a weapon

40:25.580 --> 40:28.140
that's about as weak as all your other weapons.

40:28.140 --> 40:31.020
You can find laser pistols in the Mart outside Megaton,

40:31.020 --> 40:31.980
but guess what?

40:31.980 --> 40:34.540
At this point, you probably haven't put much points into energy weapons

40:34.540 --> 40:36.620
because you haven't even seen one yet,

40:36.620 --> 40:38.700
and they're in such low condition

40:38.700 --> 40:41.580
that they're equivalent to the weapons you were already using.

40:41.580 --> 40:43.180
I've conferred with friends on this,

40:43.180 --> 40:46.140
and several of them were led to believe that laser weapons were useless

40:46.140 --> 40:48.140
because the ones they found were garbage.

40:48.140 --> 40:50.540
This isn't just me and my weird pals, either.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.580
The internet is really unsure what to think about energy weapons

40:53.580 --> 40:56.060
because the first ones you encounter are terrible.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.700
Plus, the repair system wasn't great

40:58.700 --> 41:01.980
because you can only repair a weapon if you had another of the same weapon.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.860
A lot of rare and supposedly powerful weapons could

41:04.860 --> 41:09.020
rarely, if ever, be brought up to even a fraction of their actual power.

41:09.020 --> 41:13.100
The only weapon that really survives this ridiculous damage curve is the Fat Man,

41:13.180 --> 41:17.820
simply because it's so over-the-top powerful, even in a near-broken state.

41:17.820 --> 41:21.500
The weapon degradation system is yet another pretty good idea

41:21.500 --> 41:24.220
hamstrung by crazy poor execution.

41:24.220 --> 41:25.660
Oh, and by the way,

41:25.660 --> 41:28.700
shooters already had a mechanic for limiting your ability to use a weapon

41:28.700 --> 41:30.780
that was more powerful than your current area.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.540
It's called ammunition.

41:32.540 --> 41:35.260
This is a gameplay feature that's been used in games like Doom

41:35.260 --> 41:37.340
and the Resident Evil series for decades

41:37.340 --> 41:40.380
without, pardon the pun, shooting itself in the foot

41:40.380 --> 41:44.620
by also making the weapons hot garbage equivalents to what you were already using.

41:44.620 --> 41:47.980
They simply rationed out the bullets you were using with them.

41:47.980 --> 41:48.940
Anyway, where were we?

41:56.540 --> 41:58.460
This video is already going to be super long,

41:58.460 --> 42:01.340
so instead of talking at length too much about the morality system,

42:01.340 --> 42:04.060
I'm going to use Vault 101's microcosmic nature

42:04.060 --> 42:07.660
to illustrate the larger problem with Fallout 3's morality on the whole

42:07.660 --> 42:11.180
and then maybe extemporate for a little bit too long anyway about other stuff.

42:11.180 --> 42:14.700
The closest the game really comes to a meaningful decision in Vault 101

42:14.700 --> 42:18.300
is whether or not you kill the Overseer who, by the way, wants you dead.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.300
He doesn't openly initiate combat with you.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.220
He just calls for your death.

42:22.220 --> 42:25.980
In the middle of me fighting to protect myself from guys I can't talk down,

42:25.980 --> 42:27.900
he engages you in a conversation,

42:27.900 --> 42:32.060
and you finally have the chance to tell someone you don't want to kill them.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.900
If you kill him for being a dick,

42:33.900 --> 42:35.420
a martyr is upset at you.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.100
Oh my god!

42:37.660 --> 42:38.220
Daddy!

42:39.020 --> 42:42.300
The game is using the Overseer's death as a teachable moment.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.980
Killing people makes people sad.

42:44.540 --> 42:45.040
Aww.

42:45.580 --> 42:47.340
Maybe killing people's wrong.

42:47.340 --> 42:50.700
Who appointed you judge, jury, and executioner?

42:50.700 --> 42:53.420
But just wait one backflipping moment.

42:53.420 --> 42:54.540
My mum watches my videos.

42:54.540 --> 42:55.500
I can't swear too much.

42:56.140 --> 42:59.100
That's the lesson I should take from this experience?

42:59.100 --> 43:00.380
Amata, not to be rude,

43:00.940 --> 43:03.980
but do you have any idea how many cops died

43:03.980 --> 43:06.220
because he ordered them to attack me on sight?

43:06.220 --> 43:08.300
And innocent people, too?

43:08.300 --> 43:13.180
There's something insidious and fucked up to Fallout 3's approach to morality.

43:13.180 --> 43:15.980
So many characters are utterly disposable.

43:15.980 --> 43:19.740
Throughout the game, all sorts of people will shoot at you without a second thought,

43:19.740 --> 43:23.260
and you will kill them, or you'll run away, or you'll die.

43:24.060 --> 43:28.060
That's the extent of your moral interaction with a huge portion of the game's characters.

43:28.060 --> 43:30.380
The game could have had a more nuanced perspective,

43:30.380 --> 43:34.140
where the player is, at any point, made to consider that all these people had friends,

43:34.140 --> 43:35.740
and parents, and children,

43:35.740 --> 43:40.140
but instead, being nice is reserved for a couple of specific people,

43:40.140 --> 43:43.660
who are often the most responsible for the problems you experience.

43:43.660 --> 43:48.860
How nice of Bethesda to occasionally let me specifically be nice to one person.

43:48.860 --> 43:53.100
Worse than not even giving you the option of being decent to these guys just doing their jobs,

43:53.100 --> 43:57.660
the game has a fucking pop-up tell you when it deems an action as the right or wrong thing.

43:57.660 --> 44:01.100
Yeah, that's right, let's talk about the amazing karma system.

44:01.100 --> 44:04.940
I kind of feel like any game which can measure your morality with a number

44:04.940 --> 44:07.580
is kind of problematic,

44:07.580 --> 44:13.180
because it means, A, it thinks it is the arbiter of when something is a right or wrong decision,

44:13.180 --> 44:14.780
in no uncertain terms,

44:14.780 --> 44:20.060
or B, the game is stupid and so lacking in depth or complexity in its writing

44:20.060 --> 44:22.700
that you really can boil things down that far.

44:23.420 --> 44:25.740
You only really lose karma for stealing,

44:25.740 --> 44:29.100
or for actively killing people who weren't shooting at you first,

44:29.100 --> 44:32.060
but some people you do gain karma for openly killing,

44:32.060 --> 44:34.060
because they're apparently just that bad,

44:34.060 --> 44:36.940
so you can walk into a bar and do this.

44:41.500 --> 44:45.100
But because he's a bad guy, everyone just sort of ignores it.

44:45.100 --> 44:49.100
You gain karma for shooting a man in the face in public.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.620
I did a good thing there.

44:51.260 --> 44:54.140
Meanwhile, with a few specific characters,

44:54.140 --> 44:57.020
often leaders of the groups that are trying to kill you,

44:57.020 --> 44:59.180
the ones who initiate the whole thing,

44:59.180 --> 45:03.340
all of a sudden, you're supposed to consider the importance of human life.

45:03.980 --> 45:07.340
The Overseer is the first in a long line of people who you can spare,

45:07.340 --> 45:10.220
or convince to change their ways, or give up, or whatever,

45:10.220 --> 45:13.100
but who accidentally make the fact you kill your way wantonly

45:13.100 --> 45:16.780
through so many people to get to them fall completely flat.

45:16.780 --> 45:19.820
The player's required to only think about the human effects of their actions

45:19.820 --> 45:22.380
once the game decides it's time to stop and think.

45:23.100 --> 45:26.140
Yes, you can be nice and spare the Overseer.

45:26.860 --> 45:28.060
But that guy's fucked!

45:29.260 --> 45:32.300
Worse than not even giving you a chance to really be a good person,

45:32.300 --> 45:35.900
the game doesn't even really let you be a bad person either.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.140
And by bad person, I don't mean,

45:38.140 --> 45:40.860
whoa, hey, let's kill all these people for no reason.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.940
Whee! I'm so edgy!

45:42.940 --> 45:44.540
My name is not important.

45:47.020 --> 45:47.520
Whee!

45:50.140 --> 45:52.940
I mean as in the game, never, and I do mean never,

45:52.940 --> 45:55.500
puts you in a situation where the lines are blurred,

45:55.500 --> 45:58.060
or where both sides in a conflict have a point,

45:58.060 --> 46:01.980
or are both equally wrong and can be opposed by a superior idea,

46:01.980 --> 46:04.700
or where only you benefit from the arrangement,

46:04.700 --> 46:07.420
but in the long run, this might be better for the world as a whole

46:07.420 --> 46:09.660
because you are, after all, the main character.

46:10.380 --> 46:14.860
You're only ever really being nice, or being a fucking murder man.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.500
That's a job in Fallout!

46:17.500 --> 46:20.620
Comparatively, in a good game, for example, Fallout 1,

46:20.620 --> 46:23.980
there's enough of a texture to the problems that are put in your path

46:23.980 --> 46:27.740
that you can kind of see either side being justifiable.

46:27.740 --> 46:29.740
If you side in Junk Town with Gizmo,

46:29.740 --> 46:32.060
who's quite straightforwardly a self-interested dick

46:32.060 --> 46:35.260
who wants the sheriff dead because it's bad for his business...

46:35.260 --> 46:38.220
I want him dead because he cramps my business.

46:39.420 --> 46:41.180
...Junk Town gets better.

46:41.180 --> 46:44.940
It grows and becomes a far more successful town than it could have been before.

46:44.940 --> 46:47.020
While I don't personally think it's a good choice,

46:47.020 --> 46:49.660
there's enough room here that I could see someone

46:49.660 --> 46:53.260
with different socio-political beliefs than me making a convincing argument

46:53.260 --> 46:56.220
that Gizmo's version of Junk Town is a more prosperous one

46:56.220 --> 46:58.220
that's ultimately better for the people in it.

46:58.220 --> 47:00.540
That's right! Fallout 1 managed to give you options

47:00.540 --> 47:05.340
where the right answer can depend on what you personally think is best for humanity!

47:05.340 --> 47:08.780
And speaking of the towns made of junk that you encounter in the beginning of the game,

47:08.780 --> 47:11.500
Fallout 3 attempts a similar choice with Megaton.

47:11.500 --> 47:15.180
You can either make the bomb safe and help the people a little,

47:15.180 --> 47:18.700
or blow the whole town to fucking smithereens.

47:19.740 --> 47:20.940
Wait, what?!

47:20.940 --> 47:24.620
That's right! Fallout 3's version of a nuanced moral choice is

47:24.620 --> 47:28.060
do you want to kill a bunch of innocent people or not?

47:28.700 --> 47:30.860
Is killing people for no reason okay?

47:30.860 --> 47:32.300
What a complex question!

47:32.300 --> 47:33.260
How deep?

47:33.260 --> 47:34.540
Ten out of ten!

47:34.540 --> 47:37.900
The nuke really well illustrates my problem with the game's moral system.

47:37.900 --> 47:41.260
You walk into a town, and a guy motions you over and says,

47:41.260 --> 47:42.780
hey, you want to kill everyone?

47:42.780 --> 47:44.140
I know you have no reason to want this,

47:44.140 --> 47:46.060
and to be honest, neither do I.

47:46.060 --> 47:47.660
But, and to be even more honest,

47:47.660 --> 47:48.940
neither does the guy I work for.

47:48.940 --> 47:50.300
His reasoning's really poor,

47:50.300 --> 47:53.420
but you'll feel like you're having an effect on the world, right?

47:53.420 --> 47:56.220
And since Megaton is a town that can theoretically be blown up

47:56.220 --> 47:58.140
very early in the game's story,

47:58.140 --> 48:00.700
none of the characters in it actually matter very much.

48:00.700 --> 48:01.900
They aren't allowed to.

48:01.900 --> 48:03.900
Like in other shitty games with bad writing,

48:03.900 --> 48:07.420
characters who might optionally die are often bad characters,

48:07.420 --> 48:09.020
because when they live,

48:09.020 --> 48:12.140
they can't be permitted to do anything useful or relevant to the story,

48:12.220 --> 48:14.780
because then you'd have to write the version where that doesn't happen,

48:14.780 --> 48:18.540
and that can require a lot of rewriting to account for both versions and so on.

48:18.540 --> 48:20.060
In Mass Effect 1, for example,

48:20.060 --> 48:21.980
you have the ability to let the entire council

48:21.980 --> 48:24.300
that's been giving you orders the whole game die.

48:24.300 --> 48:27.020
In the sequel, the council barely even comes up,

48:27.020 --> 48:28.220
whether they lived or not.

48:28.220 --> 48:30.060
This is because accounting for the deaths

48:30.060 --> 48:32.460
of the most important people in a political system

48:32.460 --> 48:33.740
is actually really difficult

48:33.740 --> 48:36.140
if you then also have to account for them not dying.

48:36.140 --> 48:37.740
By the time of Mass Effect 3,

48:37.740 --> 48:40.700
Bioware fucking gave up on the idea of players having freedom,

48:40.700 --> 48:42.060
and if you killed the council,

48:42.060 --> 48:44.940
they get replaced by almost identical-looking copies

48:44.940 --> 48:46.860
who are virtually no different.

48:46.860 --> 48:50.380
You're essentially getting to choose what outfit the council is wearing,

48:50.380 --> 48:53.900
so it becomes a decision that's ultimately set-dressing

48:53.900 --> 48:57.500
for what some of the people you talk to on the space telephone look like.

48:57.500 --> 49:00.540
Much like that decision, Fallout 3 renders its first town

49:00.540 --> 49:02.620
practically meaningless on purpose,

49:02.620 --> 49:06.780
because nothing of value can be at risk of having an effect on the wider story.

49:06.780 --> 49:08.700
Even your dad doesn't get that mad

49:08.700 --> 49:11.740
that you blew up a town and killed a bunch of people for no reason.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.980
You're still my son, and I love you,

49:13.980 --> 49:17.020
but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.

49:17.660 --> 49:20.140
We'll talk more about this when there's time.

49:20.140 --> 49:22.700
What—what do you have to do to get this guy to hate you?

49:22.700 --> 49:26.860
Ironically, the most nuanced and interesting character in the game to me, Moira,

49:26.860 --> 49:29.180
actually does survive this incident,

49:29.180 --> 49:32.060
presumably because the developers put so much effort

49:32.060 --> 49:33.900
into her long and varied quest

49:33.900 --> 49:36.700
that they didn't want to risk players missing out on it,

49:36.700 --> 49:41.260
so, effectively, walking into Megaton and shooting Moira in the head

49:42.300 --> 49:45.100
has worse consequences for your future options

49:45.100 --> 49:47.580
than blowing up the entire fucking town with a bomb.

49:48.380 --> 49:49.420
Nice job, Bethesda.

49:49.980 --> 49:52.940
Hey, Moira, if you can hear me, I found that landmine you wanted.

49:52.940 --> 49:54.220
I'll bring it over.

49:54.220 --> 49:56.380
Keep working on the survival guide!

49:56.380 --> 50:00.300
They could have built an area that arguably deserved to be destroyed,

50:00.300 --> 50:02.380
maybe because it relied on slavery

50:02.380 --> 50:05.500
and was planning on expanding and causing more harm to others.

50:05.500 --> 50:09.020
The player would have to weigh up the cost of invoking the nuclear option,

50:09.020 --> 50:11.580
the innocents and slaves caught in the crossfire,

50:11.580 --> 50:15.740
and possibly explore alternatives and live with those choices,

50:15.740 --> 50:18.460
but instead they built a normal town and said,

50:18.460 --> 50:20.380
hey, you want to blow it up for no reason?

50:21.020 --> 50:23.740
The Be Good or Be History's Greatest Monster choice

50:23.740 --> 50:26.860
is the only consistent set of choices you're given in the game.

50:26.860 --> 50:30.300
Towards the end, you have the option of putting a virus in the wasteland's water

50:30.300 --> 50:34.620
that purposefully makes it so that every mutant is probably going to die,

50:34.620 --> 50:36.620
and the person who gives you this option

50:36.620 --> 50:40.460
doesn't give you anywhere near a decent justification for this being a good idea.

50:40.460 --> 50:41.820
We're going to come back to this later,

50:41.820 --> 50:44.700
but the specific and consistent issue in this game

50:44.700 --> 50:47.900
is that you can't really be a good person or a bad person

50:47.900 --> 50:52.460
because there are no situations in which you have to decide what you think is best.

50:52.460 --> 50:55.260
There are only objectively good or bad decisions.

50:55.260 --> 50:57.500
I've chosen to play as a good guy this time.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.380
Ooh, I wonder what being a murderer is like.

51:00.380 --> 51:02.860
You leave the safety of your vault into this world, you know?

51:03.100 --> 51:04.140
You're a big decision.

51:04.140 --> 51:06.380
Am I going to help these people, or am I going to, you know,

51:06.380 --> 51:08.780
do my own thing and serve my own selfish needs?

51:08.780 --> 51:11.340
Help people or do my own thing.

51:11.340 --> 51:12.860
Those aren't real choices.

51:12.860 --> 51:15.740
What about giving the player different ways of helping people

51:15.740 --> 51:19.340
with downsides or risks or wider effects for the rest of the world?

51:19.340 --> 51:23.660
There's no junk town scenario where you have to at least stop to consider

51:23.660 --> 51:25.900
that giving Gizmo the power to pursue his business

51:25.900 --> 51:29.180
will pull more people into the town and make it stronger

51:29.180 --> 51:31.100
than the guy who runs the town's police

51:31.100 --> 51:34.700
and can be kind of iron-fisted about his ideas of what's moral.

51:34.700 --> 51:36.620
You have to pick a side.

51:36.620 --> 51:40.060
The end result is the player doesn't feel attached to the world of the game

51:40.060 --> 51:44.700
because there's nothing that demands any real moral consideration on their part.

51:44.700 --> 51:47.500
If you've decided to be good, here's all the tips I can give you.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.980
Don't nuke the town and shoot the bad guys.

51:50.780 --> 51:54.780
Fallout 3 reuses and references tons of aspects of the previous games,

51:54.780 --> 51:57.500
which is normally fine, it's in a series,

51:57.500 --> 52:00.940
but it reuses all of this stuff on a constant basis as a crutch,

52:00.940 --> 52:04.620
and it never really does any of that old stuff the justice it deserves.

52:04.620 --> 52:06.940
There are so many things that appear to have been brought back

52:06.940 --> 52:09.980
simply so the game looks more like a Fallout game,

52:09.980 --> 52:12.060
not because they actually needed to be there.

52:12.060 --> 52:13.660
It's not because the game is bad.

52:13.660 --> 52:15.100
It's because the game is good.

52:15.100 --> 52:16.700
It's not because the game is bad.

52:16.700 --> 52:20.620
A Fallout game, not because they actually needed to be there.

52:20.620 --> 52:22.460
Similarly, the Super Mutants are back.

52:22.460 --> 52:24.780
I expected this because they've been around since the first game,

52:24.780 --> 52:27.500
but I didn't expect them to be so poorly done.

52:27.500 --> 52:29.740
Fallout 1's mutants are dumb and violent,

52:29.740 --> 52:33.660
but they have a purpose and a goal and a set of beliefs about themselves and the world.

52:34.300 --> 52:38.620
The Super Mutant is the next advancement in human evolution.

52:39.420 --> 52:43.020
Soon, everyone in the world will be converted,

52:43.740 --> 52:45.740
and peace will reign.

52:46.700 --> 52:50.060
They have a moral code that they believe will lead to peace.

52:50.060 --> 52:52.620
You don't get the chance to spare any mutants in the first game,

52:52.620 --> 52:56.140
but you're given ample opportunities to explore why they can't be,

52:56.140 --> 52:58.380
and why they wouldn't listen to you.

52:58.380 --> 53:00.300
In 2, the mutants are far less relevant,

53:00.300 --> 53:03.580
but the final boss is technically a Super Mutant in power armor.

53:03.580 --> 53:06.860
Otherwise, the mutants you do run into are all a little more chilled out.

53:06.860 --> 53:08.860
You're talking a long time ago.

53:08.860 --> 53:10.700
The world's moved on.

53:10.700 --> 53:14.300
People are racist towards mutants for things that happened a long time before,

53:14.300 --> 53:17.740
and the mutants secretly still believe that their master plan could have worked.

53:17.740 --> 53:20.060
There's a texture to them, especially to Marcus,

53:20.060 --> 53:23.180
who will happily claim he thinks his best human friend

53:23.180 --> 53:26.140
would be better if they'd been turned into a mutant.

53:26.140 --> 53:28.300
What a great mutant he would have been.

53:28.300 --> 53:31.980
There are tensions, and yet there isn't any reason for hostility.

53:31.980 --> 53:35.900
It's just people with different views and appearances learning slowly to get along.

53:38.220 --> 53:40.460
In Fallout 3, the mutants are orcs.

53:40.460 --> 53:43.180
They run around killing people for seemingly no reason.

53:43.180 --> 53:45.180
They're dumb. They yell and scream about murder.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.580
They keep bags of human gore lying around.

53:48.620 --> 53:52.300
There's no master plan, no explanation, no justification.

53:52.300 --> 53:54.780
They're raiders, but tinted green.

53:54.780 --> 53:56.940
They're something for the Brotherhood to be fighting against,

53:56.940 --> 53:58.700
and we'll get to the fucking Brotherhood.

53:58.700 --> 54:01.820
The mutants are the most interesting characters in the series to me.

54:01.820 --> 54:04.780
They live a long time and have a lot to think about.

54:04.780 --> 54:06.940
Turning them into this is abysmal.

54:06.940 --> 54:09.260
They needed something for the Super Mutants to do,

54:09.260 --> 54:11.340
and they needed more things to shoot,

54:11.340 --> 54:11.840
so...

54:14.380 --> 54:16.460
But it's not just the mutants and the ghouls.

54:16.460 --> 54:19.980
All kinds of things make a reappearance for seemingly no reason.

54:19.980 --> 54:23.580
Harold, the mutant who appears in the first two games, is back.

54:24.140 --> 54:27.980
The Ghek is back, because coming up with another MacGuffin is too much work,

54:27.980 --> 54:29.820
and everyone knows the Ghek, right?

54:29.820 --> 54:32.300
Oh, the Enclave are back, because people remember them.

54:32.300 --> 54:33.980
They're still evil, wow!

54:33.980 --> 54:36.220
Now you have guys in power armor to shoot.

54:36.220 --> 54:38.380
Are you feeling serviced, fans?

54:38.380 --> 54:40.620
Ah, face-to-face, at last.

54:41.180 --> 54:44.620
Did you think having a conversation with a computer was an original idea?

54:44.620 --> 54:45.260
Wrong!

54:45.260 --> 54:49.660
Fucking Zax in the basement of The Glow in Fallout 1 was a talking robot,

54:49.660 --> 54:51.660
and you could play chess with him,

54:51.660 --> 54:53.820
and discuss what it means to be human,

54:53.820 --> 54:56.460
and evolution, and the mutation,

54:56.460 --> 55:00.060
and the nature of artificial intelligence in infinitely more detail

55:00.060 --> 55:03.260
than any conversation you can have with John Henry Eden.

55:03.820 --> 55:05.820
Zax might seem like a minor point,

55:05.820 --> 55:08.860
but it speaks volumes about the difference in writing quality,

55:08.860 --> 55:12.860
that while in Fallout 1 you can have longer and more philosophically interesting conversations

55:12.860 --> 55:16.700
than that take place anywhere in Fallout 3 with an optional character,

55:16.700 --> 55:19.660
I'll bet a huge portion of players never even found.

55:19.660 --> 55:22.860
And then we have the Brotherhood of Steel.

55:23.660 --> 55:24.860
Let's go back again.

55:24.860 --> 55:28.940
In Fallout 1, you barely see much of them for most of the game,

55:28.940 --> 55:31.740
but their face is looking right at you when you open it.

55:31.740 --> 55:32.860
They're coming.

55:32.860 --> 55:34.140
They're coming, oh boy!

55:34.140 --> 55:35.900
And when you do meet them and you want to join,

55:35.900 --> 55:39.500
they send you on a suicide mission that they intend for you to die on.

55:39.500 --> 55:44.060
In fact, when you get there, you find the corpses of the previous people they sent.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.500
You learn they hoard technology,

55:45.500 --> 55:49.020
and they're kind of isolationists who believe in keeping track of technology,

55:49.020 --> 55:51.980
and science, and knowledge in order to preserve it for the future,

55:51.980 --> 55:55.180
so that the best of humanity can be restored in better days.

55:55.180 --> 55:57.180
Even though you can gain an understanding of them,

55:57.180 --> 55:59.100
and convince them to help you a little,

55:59.100 --> 56:02.300
they ultimately remain hidden underground.

56:02.300 --> 56:03.260
That's their choice.

56:03.980 --> 56:08.060
The beautiful, capital-B beautiful thing about the Brotherhood of Steel

56:08.060 --> 56:09.340
is that they're so human.

56:09.900 --> 56:14.700
They're likable, they're cool, they're smart, they're powerful, and they're wrong.

56:15.340 --> 56:19.500
Fallout 2 is the story of their failure to truly help the world or themselves

56:19.500 --> 56:21.500
as they wither away into nothingness.

56:21.500 --> 56:23.980
The title screen of 2 is an enclave soldier.

56:23.980 --> 56:27.660
The Brotherhood have been replaced as the strongest faction in the Wasteland.

56:27.660 --> 56:32.220
And a loading screen features a tribal in the same pose as the knight from Fallout 1's title screen,

56:32.220 --> 56:34.220
wearing a desecrated Brotherhood helmet.

56:34.780 --> 56:37.020
That's some pretty powerful imagery right there,

56:37.020 --> 56:38.700
especially for a loading screen.

56:38.700 --> 56:40.540
They were never really the good guys,

56:40.540 --> 56:42.060
but they did care,

56:42.620 --> 56:44.700
and you kind of feel sad for their mistakes.

56:45.420 --> 56:48.140
In Fallout 3, the Brotherhood run around shooting mutants

56:48.140 --> 56:50.220
because they're the good guys now.

56:50.780 --> 56:51.980
And no, I'm not saying,

56:51.980 --> 56:55.020
well, I'm a big baby, you have to do the Brotherhood this way.

56:55.020 --> 56:58.060
No, they can be any way the writer wants them to.

56:58.060 --> 57:01.660
They could not even be in a Fallout game because they all died.

57:02.220 --> 57:06.300
They could be six guys holding on after the end of their whole way of life.

57:06.300 --> 57:09.180
They could be exactly the sort of group they are in Fallout 3.

57:09.180 --> 57:10.460
But whatever they are,

57:10.460 --> 57:11.980
they have to be done well.

57:12.540 --> 57:17.580
None of the Brotherhood are given sufficient levels of characterization or writing or relatability.

57:17.580 --> 57:20.460
You never really understand these people.

57:20.460 --> 57:21.900
They feel like props.

57:21.900 --> 57:24.700
The majority of your interaction with them is part of the main story,

57:24.700 --> 57:25.580
which we will get to,

57:26.140 --> 57:28.620
or just kind of uninteresting busywork.

57:28.620 --> 57:32.220
There's a central area with some generic guys shooting at targets,

57:32.220 --> 57:35.340
some rooms off to the side with a couple of people you can talk to a little,

57:35.340 --> 57:37.980
but there's nothing you can really gain from them.

57:37.980 --> 57:40.140
Nothing really happens here.

57:40.140 --> 57:44.620
It's like a Brotherhood of Steel-themed attraction at a park.

57:44.620 --> 57:45.740
It doesn't feel like a place,

57:45.740 --> 57:48.540
and the Brotherhood doesn't feel like a cohesive group.

57:48.540 --> 57:53.340
In Fallout 1, the Brotherhood of Steel was a place you could get quite invested in learning about,

57:53.340 --> 57:55.580
with a multifaceted membership.

57:55.580 --> 57:58.700
The Brotherhood weren't just a place you could get guns and plot.

57:58.700 --> 58:00.140
Fallout 1 has talking heads,

58:00.140 --> 58:01.980
but when you talk to someone occasionally,

58:01.980 --> 58:03.660
you get a big shot of their face,

58:03.660 --> 58:05.980
and, uh, ooh, they mouth at you.

58:05.980 --> 58:09.660
What the bloody, bloody, bloody hell are you doing here?!

58:09.660 --> 58:14.380
There are four of the game's, what, ten talking heads in the Brotherhood base,

58:14.380 --> 58:18.700
and all of them have a distinct personality from the moment you walk up to them.

58:18.700 --> 58:21.740
Greetings. It's a fine day for learning.

58:21.740 --> 58:26.140
You have Cabot, the obedient, nice, but kind of dumb door guy

58:26.140 --> 58:30.140
who does the real work of defending the place and hefts the big guns.

58:30.140 --> 58:34.220
You have Vree, the head scribe who privileges knowledge and invention.

58:34.220 --> 58:35.660
Speak to the knights.

58:35.660 --> 58:38.860
Ask them to show you one of the latest laser pistols I designed.

58:38.860 --> 58:41.660
That's right. In Fallout 1, new things are being made.

58:41.660 --> 58:43.500
They're not just salvaging old technology,

58:43.500 --> 58:44.780
in stark contrast to 3,

58:44.780 --> 58:48.140
where all characters are doing nothing but salvage old discarded shit

58:48.140 --> 58:49.580
and creating nothing of their own.

58:49.580 --> 58:52.220
Ironically, the same attitude the developers had.

58:52.220 --> 58:55.340
Vree specifically doesn't think history itself is important.

58:55.340 --> 59:00.300
She's more interested in researching the sciences and discovering the future than in the past.

59:00.300 --> 59:04.220
You have head paladin Rhombus, a gruff and no-nonsense guy

59:04.220 --> 59:07.500
who doesn't really want to talk to you and directs you to Vree

59:07.500 --> 59:10.860
if you ask anything sciencey or that requires a long-winded explanation.

59:10.860 --> 59:12.700
Talk to Vree in the main library.

59:12.700 --> 59:15.340
He represents the militaristic nature of the Brotherhood

59:15.340 --> 59:17.740
and their descendants from the US Army.

59:17.740 --> 59:21.980
I could teach you how to fight if you had any ability.

59:21.980 --> 59:23.980
You have General Maxson, the High Elder,

59:23.980 --> 59:26.300
who manages to have a sense of humour and friendliness,

59:26.300 --> 59:30.780
but also a sharp wit and an openly militaristic discipline streak to him.

59:31.420 --> 59:33.980
You can tell just from how he's written

59:33.980 --> 59:37.020
that he was a fighter himself before he was given command.

59:37.020 --> 59:40.940
He's a leader who embodies a nice mix of the traits of the other three characters.

59:40.940 --> 59:44.380
This gives you a sense that the Brotherhood at its core really is a brotherhood,

59:44.380 --> 59:47.180
a fraternity of people who take care of each other

59:47.180 --> 59:49.420
and are ultimately very close-knit,

59:49.420 --> 59:52.460
not just visible in their constant worrying about the missing knights

59:52.460 --> 59:56.860
who went out on an expedition whose trail you can pick up on and eventually rescue,

59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.540
but in things as simple as how their leader comprises a mix

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.940
of all of their attitudes and beliefs.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.820
The Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 1 gives a convincing impression

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.900
of a functioning mini-society,

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:12.780
creating a sense of a vast group of different intersecting personalities within their halls,

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.420
and it does it with four faces.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.700
Every single member of the Brotherhood in Fallout 3 has a face,

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.740
but they barely have one personality between them.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.380
The Brotherhood is at your service.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.060
The Brotherhood is at your service.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.300
You can shoot them into tiny pieces of carefully modelled meat,

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.580
but you can't have a meaningful conversation about science with them.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.100
It's very clear that Bethesda wanted to do their own versions

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.340
of Maxson, Rhombus, Vree, and Cabot,

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.260
either as yet another reference or because they genuinely had no ideas of their own,

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.420
so here's a test of these new characters.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.260
What's this guy's name?

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.740
What sort of personality does he have besides generic door guard?

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:57.020
Cabot's name has been burned into my brain since I played Fallout 1 about 14 years ago.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.740
He had a lovely, unassuming nature,

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.500
a uniquely shaped head,

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.220
and represented not only the Brotherhood's defensiveness,

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.540
but their inner kindness to one another.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.700
I want to take Cabot for a walk on the beach and just talk about stuff for a while.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.380
Fallout 3 was a chance to show a chapter of the Brotherhood that had redeemed themselves,

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.700
where they saw the result of their foolishness coming

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.220
and decided to help the people of the Wasteland form a better society,

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.060
but instead they're a confusing mishmash of their presentation in the first two games,

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.540
being rude to outsiders, not letting anyone in,

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.060
with cookie-cutter,

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.580
maybe being nice to people is a good thing nonsense mixed in with it.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.540
None of them offer any real justification for this change,

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.620
and even as characters in themselves,

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.620
none of them even say anything as flavourful and character-establishing

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.580
as it's a fine day for learning.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:44.940
So there.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.780
I hope that makes me seem not against changing the Brotherhood on principle,

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:53.260
just against changing it badly and not giving them enough characterisation or justification

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.420
for why they are how they are.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.660
Just like how I'm not strictly against the idea of there being a Mega Man cartoon,

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.500
but that doesn't mean I'm okay with...

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.660
♪ Super-flying robot! ♪

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.300
♪ Yeah, yeah! ♪

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.780
♪ Super-flying robot! ♪

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:12.620
The re-use of old concepts smacks, like with the opening birth scene,

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.740
of hasty attempts at storytelling and world-building.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.540
It's as if the developers were handed the rights to three,

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.140
and they knew they had to make a game,

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.620
but not what should actually go into it,

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.660
resulting in a cobbled-together mishmash of whatever

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.780
original ideas they came up with in some initial meeting,

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.620
and ideas borrowed from the other games but given no real thought.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.820
The Fallout series is characterised largely not by adherence to a core set of concepts,

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.260
but by change.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.780
War never changes, but the world the war is fought in does.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.100
In Fallout 2, things changed.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.060
The Super Mutants weren't trying to conquer the world in the name of progress,

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.380
they were survivors of a dead ideology,

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.860
and the ones left were trying to do good,

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.220
or at least have some peace,

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.660
living in a town founded on the site where a Brotherhood knight

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.900
and a Super Mutant fought for so long

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.140
that they realised how pointless it was,

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.700
and sat down and started working together.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:09.020
That sort of concept was unthinkable in the world of the first Fallout.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:12.540
Things didn't stay the same just for the sake of being like the old one.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.460
Even the money changed.

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.860
Fallout 3 didn't know what it wanted to be,

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.900
or how to grow or shift or change these things,

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.780
so it ended up playing like a Cliff Notes version of the ideas

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.580
that were popular or well-known in the previous ones.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.620
Caps are back,

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.460
because caps are a pop-culturally-remembered thing from Fallout 1.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:33.500
The Mutants are here, but they're just generic bad guys.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.900
The Brotherhood of Steel has changed,

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.500
but rather than an interesting or meaningful or fitting change,

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:44.300
they're boiled down to such goody-two-shoes heroes of the wasteland with no depth

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.420
that they fail to actually progress the Brotherhood thematically.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.500
They're like a misremembered version of the Brotherhood from the first two games.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.900
If you boiled it down really, really far down,

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.740
you could have called the Brotherhood the goodies in 1 and 2.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.140
So that's what got translated over.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.140
It's like playing a game of telephone.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.020
Ring ring!

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:03.980
Hello?

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.860
What's that?

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.860
I'm a bad game designer!

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.460
Whaaaaa—

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.140
Todd Howard doesn't sound like that.

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:19.660
But the one thing that makes Fallout truly special is its themes,

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:23.980
its wider story about humans and the problems we face within ourselves

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.220
and how we conquer them and progress to new ones.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.220
Everyone likes to pretend that their favorite game has—

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.580
Ooh, it's an internal struggle!

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.740
But Fallout gets it real, man!

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.580
Despite being open-world games where the player can go anywhere

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.940
and with stories over which the player has a tremendous amount of influence,

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.540
the original games manage to be incredibly well-structured and paced.

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.580
You start small, getting sucked into the squabble and junk town,

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.220
and then you find yourself inexorably drawn to the hub.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.660
Each game begins with relative chaos in which everything's up for grabs,

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.500
but there isn't much to grab,

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.380
and you're skirmishing with small groups over petty issues,

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.060
and things are messy and difficult and almost seem to lack a moral dimension

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:03.420
because you're still making your way and figuring out what's going on

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.740
and getting the equipment you need to save your vault.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.660
Then, as you get more educated,

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.500
you discover areas with complex but identifiable moral problems.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.140
Entire populations are at stake if you execute an idea poorly or take the easy option.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.580
Getting the water chip can doom the ghoul community of Necropolis

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.820
if you don't help them fix their own water problems,

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.100
and their community has members who could do with getting rid of, too,

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.820
not to mention the mutants standing right there!

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.860
Unfortunately for them, we can see an isometric.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.380
Not every decision is easy,

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.620
but you develop a sense of how to make things right

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.500
and a consideration for the wiser effects of your actions.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.260
You fight larger and stronger groups,

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.660
and by this point, you're assisted by a crew of your own.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.980
You get better weapons and armor and more allies.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.180
You get smart.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.180
Then, in the final act,

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.860
you get access to amazing technology

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.860
and an incredibly in-depth understanding of why the world is the way it is,

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.980
from speaking to scientists and Zaks.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.500
The tension keeps rising,

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.580
but all the distractions scale back.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.580
The fate of the world is at stake,

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.780
not because the crosshairs are manually on people like before,

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.620
but because you're getting confronted with the questions that lie at the heart of the world,

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.540
and having to come up with a solution to them,

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.620
or everything is fucked.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.100
Concepts solidify and sides are taken,

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.700
the true motivating forces behind the problems the world face are made known,

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:19.980
and then,

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.100
finally,

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.100
you go to meet them.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.060
You make contact with the followers of the Apocalypse,

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.940
a group that has infiltrated the cathedral built on top of the vault

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:34.060
where the master, the leader of the mutants, is residing.

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.500
They send a lot of help with you,

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.340
and you descend into the corrupted vault,

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.260
covered in proto-Lovecraftian ooze

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.980
and swarming with mutants, monsters, and psychics.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.980
The final fight is very difficult.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.260
The mutants are numerous,

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.700
which doesn't go well with the incredible danger even one of them can pose.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.900
They eventually thin out, but so do your allies.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.660
This fight seems specifically designed

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.540
so it's a struggle even for the strongest possible character,

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.980
and no one who enters with you will leave alive.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.420
But eventually,

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.780
the enemies thin out,

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.060
paring away,

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.540
until you're alone in a hallway,

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.020
and at the end is one person.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.300
The entire game is preparing you for the moment

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.820
where you and the master,

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.980
who's been in charge of the entire mutant problem

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.700
that threatens the world with domination this whole time,

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.700
stand in a room together and talk.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.340
This final hallway tenses me up every time.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.380
It's a confrontation with a comprehensive belief system

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.860
that so far has been doing really well for itself,

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.060
and you have to stop it,

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.060
or mankind is probably done.

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.540
You've gone from fighting scorpions to getting antidotes

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.060
so someone will sell you a rope

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:39.260
and slap fights with casino owners over their business practices,

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.220
to sitting next to the arbiter of the world's doom

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.860
and trying to explain what is wrong with their plan,

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.700
and it happens seamlessly.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.620
So what shall it be?

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.380
Do you join the unity,

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.140
or do you die here?

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.300
Everything has been pushing you towards the moment

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.780
when you have to tell the man who thinks he has the solution

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.460
to the problems you've been facing

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.060
that he's wrong.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.540
These are the crowning moments of Fallout.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.140
They're the culmination of their story,

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.340
their themes, their ideas,

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.660
and all of your character's choices, too.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.940
Do you just want to fight them?

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.980
Are you unprepared, making the fight unavoidable and difficult?

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.380
Do you try to talk to them and maybe, just maybe,

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.500
change their mind?

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.740
The conversation with the master is nuts.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.180
He wants to know where your vault is

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.660
and has a compelling reason you should tell him.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.820
It's a chance to assure the mutants can be strong enough

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.940
to survive the wastes where mankind has and will not.

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.100
As long as there are differences,

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:32.460
we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other.

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:35.660
Because there are no obvious speech options popping up with percentiles,

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.500
there's no way of telling what the best way of attempting to talk him down might be

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.340
except for your own judgment.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.580
You have to engage him as a reasonable person.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.780
The best thing is,

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.660
it's impossible for him to be talked down on moral grounds.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.180
He doesn't care about mankind's survival or killing people

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.660
because for him, the mutants are the future of mankind

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.660
and the ends justify the means.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.300
The only way to talk him down

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.180
is to explain why the plan wouldn't work.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.780
This isn't just a speech check.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.740
To do this, you have to ask everyone about the mutants,

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.500
about what makes them what they are.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.460
Eventually, you can find through Vree that the mutants are sterile,

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.020
and she gives you the evidence that proves this is the case.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.420
The master rejects this as a forgery anyway.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.740
You have to get him to ask his own mutants

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.620
if any of them have gotten pregnant before he realizes the truth.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.700
...and healing.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.100
It was madness.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.820
I can see that now.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.180
Madness.

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.380
Madness?

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.420
There is no hope.

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:57.660
Leave now.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.500
Leave while you still have...

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.620
...hope.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.620
The final speech he gives is sad, amazing,

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.660
and deeply humanizing for such a monstrous character.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.460
Video game characters rarely have good voice actors,

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.220
and the master has, too,

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.380
playing about four different voices.

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:31.660
Jim Cummings and Kath Soucie both make great performances

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:35.260
that contribute to one of the best moments in video game character history.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.220
After that, all that's left is to fight your way through another

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.180
and hopefully, you'll be able to get to the end of the story.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:46.380
After that, all that's left is to fight your way through an army of his men

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.940
and escape the base before the GAME CRASHES!

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.860
I mean before the base explodes.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:55.740
Outwitting the master feels like you've genuinely contended with an apocalyptic ideology

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.300
and beaten it with intelligence and reason,

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.300
not simply the strength of your gun or some cookie-cutter heroic speech.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.780
By the way, the male voices of the master are by the same man who voices Winnie the Pooh.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.300
I just thought I'd let you know that.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.540
Fallout 2 does a lot to...

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:11.900
Fallout 2 does a lot as well.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:16.060
Frank Horrigan has a similar culmination of that game's themes,

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.860
but if I talk about it now, I'll be here for another hour,

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.780
so I'm just gonna skip ahead, okay?

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.060
It's good. It's good.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.380
Play Fallout 2. Play it. Please.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.580
The part where you have a short talk to the man in the room

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.660
who embodies all the problems you've faced

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.860
is the best part of those two Fallout games by far to me.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.940
They tie everything together.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.100
Fallout 3 pits you against Colonel Autumn.

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.780
You again.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:46.460
Autumn has been a dick to you personally,

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:50.140
but he doesn't represent any major flaw in the world of Fallout 3.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.620
He isn't the culmination of the problems you've seen.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.020
He just sort of turns up halfway through.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.940
He's just a guy standing there saying,

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.020
well, I guess it's time for us to fight now.

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.820
And in the space of three lines of conversation,

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.860
if you pass a speech check, you can talk him out of fighting,

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.140
you can talk him out of fighting,

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.980
and he just fucking walks out.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.380
Colonel Autumn doesn't really stand for anything.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.420
He doesn't want anything.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:14.380
He doesn't represent any core concept you've had to face

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.420
over the course of the game.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:19.340
He's a wet fart on the face of Fallout storytelling.

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.660
He's a piss in the mouth of philosophy.

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.380
He's a sledgehammer to the balls of the inner child

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.580
of the mind of thought.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.540
This character has broken my brain!

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.460
The ending, this final room,

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.140
could have made everything about the game come together and make sense.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.700
It would be difficult, but it could have happened,

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.860
and at least put a nice bow on things.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.140
But instead, it's exactly the ending you would fucking expect

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.660
from the rest of Fallout 3,

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.460
and yet that somehow still feels disappointing.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:51.740
Worse than that, this game had two chances to get this right.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.340
There were two men in rooms.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.220
When you meet President Eden, you're in a similar scenario.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.540
Eden wants to convince you to enact his genocide,

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.020
but unlike with the Master or the Lieutenant or anyone,

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.660
there's no explanation, no underlying motive.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:04.380
It's just,

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.580
I am bad guy.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.140
We need to kill mutants. Genocide good.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:11.660
Super mutants and ghouls must be purged.

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:15.420
We need to clear the way for humanity to rebuild the wastes.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.980
The Master had a comprehensive explanation

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.340
for why the human race needed to be converted into mutants now.

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.380
Bethesda can't come up with a single compelling explanation

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.300
for why this is actually a good idea

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.660
beyond the platitude of,

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.180
we need to undo mutants.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.780
Do you get it? I'm a racist.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.260
There's no philosophical struggle.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.980
It's impossible to even attempt to reason out

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:39.020
why this philosophy is right or wrong in a rational manner

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.460
because it's so fucking stupid that it defies rationality.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.580
You can't show him that the mutants aren't the real problem,

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.700
that the real problem is something even the Enclave are a part of,

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:53.580
the all-too-human need to continue to make unending war and death.

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.100
How do you talk him down, then?

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.980
Well, you get a please-kill-yourself speech option,

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.820
and then you say, uh, you know,

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.500
don't be bad. It's bad.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.420
Aren't you tired of being bad?

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.260
And then he says, okay.

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.340
Yes, I suppose it is.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:08.940
Very well.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.260
I'll put an end to the Enclave.

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:12.780
And he does.

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.140
This should be a joke,

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.660
like, wow, President Eden was poorly fucking programmed,

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.180
or the Enclave are fucking idiots all the way up to the top.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.900
But because there's no real discussion or struggle

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:36.460
or philosophical point to be made by any of the factions or characters in this game,

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:41.260
it becomes strikingly clear that this really was the best Bethesda could do,

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.940
and that's just sad.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.900
Speaking of stupid, one-dimensional choices,

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.700
after dealing with Autumn, you get one more moral choice.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.500
Someone has to save the Purifier,

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.620
but they will die trying in the radioactive chamber.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.020
This choice fundamentally decides your ending.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.780
If you do it, you're a hero.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.740
If you let the real main character, who's been making the real choices,

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.500
leading the charge, making the speeches,

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.580
and literally has been putting her life on the line the entire time to do it,

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:08.780
you're a coward.

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.620
You can be good or bad.

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:13.820
It's exactly the moral choice Fallout 3 would give you.

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.060
That's it. No nuance, no chance to argue,

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.980
hey, maybe these heroic people who love helping people and being nice could do it.

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.220
If you pick Lyons, regardless of your reasoning,

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.380
you're basically objectively a coward.

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.260
And then it's over.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.860
You get your fucking slideshow,

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.620
and war never changes,

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.500
and goodbye.

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.500
Which one of you did this?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.460
Which one?!

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.060
Wait a second, I brought Forks with me.

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.420
He's immune to radiation.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.540
In fact, earlier in the game, he did that.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.100
Why doesn't he just save the world and let us all live?

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.460
No.

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.780
Oh, well, that's just fucking great!

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:50.220
The developers created an ending choice so stupid within their own fiction

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.220
that all of a sudden, the fucking hyper-intelligent mutant

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.580
has to develop a sense of destiny to fear denying you.

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:01.340
They wanted to pick the most generic hero-coward choice possible,

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:03.260
and to do it, they deliberately had to make sure

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.500
the far better option wasn't available for no reason!

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.420
Do you want to do this stupid thing,

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.820
or this stupid but evil thing?

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.260
What about this clear third option that's actually better than either?

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:15.900
No.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:20.700
If you are writing an open-ended RPG about choice and morality,

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.740
and there is a clear option the player could decide to take,

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.260
and you put the option there, and you tell them no,

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:28.140
you fucked up!

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.380
But you didn't just fuck up the ending,

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.020
because the sort of idiots who would make this decision

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.780
made the rest of the game too.

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.140
Those same shit-stained fingerprints are all over it.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.100
Pick a cartoon character, or kill them both.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.820
Nuke a town for no reason, or don't.

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.220
Ask Tenpenny Tower not to be racist,

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.260
or fucking murder a bunch of innocent girls for no reason.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.180
I don't even know what Autumn wanted.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.660
He was against Eden's genocide plan.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.500
Seemingly all Autumn wanted

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.620
was for the Purity Project to have an Enclave sticker on it.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.500
When it isn't clear what the final boss's plan is,

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
it's time to do a rewrite.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.340
No, wait! I didn't mean that!

01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.060
No!

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:06.560
No—

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.460
Do you get it? It's a reference to the name of the final—

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.340
Ah, whatever.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.020
We all knew I was going to cover this.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.540
Everyone hated the ending.

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.460
People hated Bethesda so much,

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.700
they wanted to shit themselves inside out.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.540
They were made of piss.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.300
There isn't enough hyperbole to explain

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.180
how mad people were with the stupid ending.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.820
Then Bethesda released the Broken Steel DLC.

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.220
So now you survive your heroic sacrifice.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.860
While being able to carry on is arguably a straightforward improvement,

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.100
it speaks volumes that the developers either

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:39.820
A.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.580
didn't think of that in the first place

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.460
in the years it took making and playtesting the game,

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:47.100
during which they claimed to have played the originals.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:47.900
Hmm.

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.140
Maybe we should make a version of Fallout 2

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.500
that's missing a key feature

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.540
and hope the player has a save before the ending started.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.060
Great idea, Todd!

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.180
And while you're at it,

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.220
let's add more companions who are immune to radiation

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.460
but refuse to fix the purifier.

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.540
By the way, Todd, you don't sound so good.

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.260
Are you okay?

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:06.540
Or B.

01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.900
They really believed in the finality of their project

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.100
in giving the Lone Wanderer a semblance of a complete arc

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.620
going from birth to death,

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:17.900
then walked back on it the instant people complained.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.500
Or C.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.980
Did this deliberately so players would buy the DLC

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.900
unless some carry on playing their game.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.020
You'll notice there's no footage from Broken Steel in this video.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.900
That's because, back when it came out,

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.500
I found myself wondering

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.860
why I would pay to play more of Fallout 3.

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.740
I had already accidentally slipped and hit the button

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.500
that buys Operation Anchorage,

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.540
a ten-quid-costing corridor full of generic enemies

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.740
you can't talk to,

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.420
terminating in a general who gives up

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.020
if you say one thing to him.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.580
In other words, a microcosm of the actual game.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.140
Players had to fix the beginning,

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.140
the developers had to fix the end,

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:57.020
and that leaves only a middle consisting of hollow nonsense

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.180
where you shoot the bad guys until they die

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.820
and collect Fallout-themed MacGuffins.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.220
It's no surprise that players who have the most fun

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.020
are the ones who traipse around on their own kind of adventure,

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:10.540
shunning the garbage experience poorly planned for their perusal,

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.860
flicking on the radio, and just doing whatever they like.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.780
A friend who is way smarter than me

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.100
has played Fallout 3 for a very long time,

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.140
and still does,

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.220
because they essentially just walk around,

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.980
taking very little interest in the experience

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.340
the world had planned for them.

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.020
The best way to have fun with the game

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.460
is to view the whole thing as something to take a walking tour through,

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.380
purposefully carving out your own journey

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.220
almost in spite of the game itself.

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:33.980
These people aren't playing the game wrong

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.820
for not focusing on the story.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.660
They're proving how wrong the game is

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.220
by showing how differently the game has to be approached

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.660
in order to be enjoyed.

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.540
It is a story-driven action RPG

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.980
in which, to have fun,

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.780
you have to avoid the story on purpose.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.580
For a long time, like, years,

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.500
I was pretty sure Fallout 3 wasn't just bad,

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:01.180
but it was proof you couldn't make a nuanced 3D game of its scale

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.540
without it being bad.

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.540
There wasn't enough time to make it good.

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:07.020
There was too much manpower involved.

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.060
I thought that maybe the future was dark for RPGs.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.580
When New Vegas came out,

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.500
I didn't play it for about two years.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.780
I'd been burned before.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.460
But then one day in university,

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.460
I did.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.100
Fallout New Vegas is the fourth game on that list.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.740
It fixed everything.

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.220
The opening isn't seven million hours long

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.460
populated with unavoidable murder.

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.140
You walk over to a machine,

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:47.180
pick your stats,

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.780
sit a short personality test,

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.140
and you go on an adventure.

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.380
Traits are back.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.300
The mutants in Brotherhood and Enclave

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.140
are treated differently from their appearances

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.660
in 1, 2, and 3,

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.900
and their changes are explained and justified

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.100
and understandable

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.180
while not distracting from the main story,

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.460
which concerns the threat posed by an entirely new faction

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:09.500
because the creators knew how to come up with new ideas.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:13.500
And the new faction is a group of seemingly unjustifiably genocidal fascists,

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.260
but when you sit down with their leader,

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.340
he gives a meaningful and legitimate criticism of democracy itself

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.060
and starts talking about the Hegelian dialectic.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.220
When that happened the first time I played,

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:29.260
I cried the only two tears I have ever wept playing a video game.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.820
I am not embarrassed to admit that even a little.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.620
Conversations are fixed.

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.980
Not only are speech checks no longer just a fucking dice roll,

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.980
you can use skills besides speech,

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.260
especially barter,

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.220
to get an edge,

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.660
but if you don't have enough,

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.420
you get a joke option that automatically fails just for fun.

01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:49.660
You can repair weapons using other stuff,

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.300
making the laser pistol you find in the first room of the game

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.460
an immediately useful option.

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.340
That's right!

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:58.460
The weapons work in Fallout New Vegas!

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:02.060
The game's writing and acting is so nuanced,

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:05.900
you can tell what a character's stance is on Caesar's Legion

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:09.180
based on how they pronounce the name Caesar.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.500
The world's design is paste,

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.900
so the game actually gets harder as you go,

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:18.220
and you actually need all the crazy explosives you pick up on the way.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.620
The only problems I can identify are

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.020
the game crashes when you try to resurrect yourself,

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:26.780
which seems ironic given how the game starts with you doing that,

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:30.060
and that I can't seem to uninstall the giant bouncy breast mod

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:33.100
a friend installed on my computer at a party years ago,

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:36.380
despite making fresh installs on several computers.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.740
That is a true story.

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.700
It is a true story, and I have healthy beliefs about women,

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.740
and...

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.180
Just cut this part out, really.

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.220
We...

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.420
They're not gonna believe me.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.380
Fallout New Vegas, for me, is...

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.020
the best game.

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.260
But for me, it's somehow even more than that.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.300
It proved that you could tell a good story and make an amazing world

01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:00.140
just by actually bothering to design and write and paste it properly.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:04.060
It fixed everything wrong with Fallout 3.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.580
Literally everything.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:09.740
I can't even go into detail about all the ways that it improves upon its predecessor,

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.380
because we're already an hour and twenty minutes in.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.900
What else can I even say?

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:14.780
I just...

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:18.060
There isn't enough time left, and we're gonna eventually have to stop.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.780
Just trust me, and give it a shot for yourself.

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.940
If, for some reason, you haven't played New Vegas,

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:27.580
perhaps because you were burned out after playing hours and hours and hours of Fallout 3,

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:30.060
maybe now is a good time to give it a shot.

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.700
Although Fallout 4 just came out, so I bet everyone's burned on that, too.

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.220
Ugh, whatever.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.740
They also seem to have seen the same problems with 3 that I have,

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:41.980
at least based on their attitude to it and its fans in the making of documentary.

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.580
A lot of people like Fallout 3.

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.540
That little smirk.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.300
That's just such a beautiful moment.

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.340
I'm gonna be honest.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:51.020
The reason why I decided to play New Vegas was because I saw him do that.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.140
I saw that smirk.

01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.460
I thought, yeah, he knows.

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.060
Th- He knows!

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:00.060
Josh Sawyer is what would happen if you dipped Todd Howard in the vats.

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.620
He's- he's just- he's just better!

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:08.780
I would do a lot of dark shit to try and get a Fallout 4 New Vegas-type situation happening,

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.260
but, to be honest, I kind of like the idea of Obsidian doing their own thing.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:17.500
Almost one of the core messages of New Vegas and what it does with the Fallout mythos is

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.300
show you that it's okay to do things differently,

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.620
and in a way, it's truer to the spirit of that by letting them just make their own thing,

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.460
not even having a Fallout name on it.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:32.220
In a way, Black Isle getting shot in the head and Obsidian rising from their grave

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.660
made them truly free to do whatever they want without being attached to any pre-existing property.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.620
Meanwhile, Bethesda's become this franchise zombie,

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.740
just making more Fallouts and more Elder Scrolls,

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.940
and- and they published the new Doom and Wolfenstein as well.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:50.620
If you asked me which developers are going to come up with the better, fresher,

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.460
more interesting and unique ideas,

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.740
well, you don't need to ask me, it's fucking obvious!

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:12.140
You can say what you like, but this, for me, is the defining moment of Fallout 3.

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:16.220
It's the most telling portion about the priorities in the game's development,

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:19.820
and the most straightforward expression of all its problems and mistakes,

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.820
and it's about ten seconds of gameplay.

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.340
You walk into the final chamber with the water purifier.

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.100
Autumn's here.

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.780
He plans to kill you with his gun because he wants to, uh,

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.500
be the guy who has the water purifier that's gonna exist anyway

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.980
and purify all the water regardless of anything.

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:41.260
In the course of three sentences, you talk him down from his desire to do this.

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:43.180
He gives up and goes to walk out.

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.780
On his way, I remember this guy doesn't deserve to walk out of here.

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:48.700
I have an obligation to stop him.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.100
I killed all his guys, I'm gonna let him go?

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.220
The guy upon whom this entire conflict can be blamed?

01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:58.300
The guy who my dad killed himself trying to stop and yet miraculously survived?

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.380
Fuck that guy!

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.740
I'm gonna shoot him in the face with a butter knife I stole from his own base!

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.700
Look at this frame for a moment.

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:15.820
The creators of this game modelled the individual 3D pieces of a face exploding.

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.980
The eyes, the brain, the skull,

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:22.940
the fleshy, gooey, splashy matter erupting from a gaping hole in his neck.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:29.340
This is a complex rendition of a head actually being crushed apart into disparate shapes

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.100
and leaving behind a gory hole.

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.940
They probably had to look up diagrams and do research for this,

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.180
model every individual piece,

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:39.980
and make sure it spawned correctly where the head once was.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.180
They wanted to make sure that when you shot someone in the face with a gun,

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:50.700
it exploded in the perfect blend of satisfying, hilarious, and grimly visceral.

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.740
The character stands for nothing.

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.100
He turns on a dime.

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:55.980
He's flat.

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.380
He's not written well in any of his appearances.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.660
They didn't write a character who you could have a real conversation with.

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:02.620
You either say,

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.340
Time to die, or give up and walk out now, please.

01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:09.580
The creator's time was apparently better spent on something else.

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.380
Planet Xbox 360 gave Fallout 3 a 9.8,

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:15.100
saying,

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.700
Presentation.

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.860
That site now redirects to a clickbait site,

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:31.660
because it turns out game reviewers really did at some point get purged the way I said they should earlier.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.580
Archive.org saved the site.

01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:36.860
The review is mostly fluff talking about how many enemies there are to kill,

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.620
how pretty the blood explosions are,

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.820
and how cool VATS is,

01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.660
and how much it reminded them of Oblivion.

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.340
The images are missing from the archive,

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.020
but it's no big loss.

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.980
I've seen enough pictures and video from enough other reviews

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:51.900
to know there'd probably be more shots from VATS of the player shooting someone else.

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:55.580
AKA, slight variations on this frame.

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.700
The developers spent their time on the presentation.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.060
On this.

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.220
Not on the writing.

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.820
Not on making you care whose face it was, and why it's exploding.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.300
But it doesn't matter now.

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:14.940
This un-nuanced, barely even written, confusing-motived man is very definitely dead.

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:17.500
But Lyons doesn't think so.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:20.540
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you just let him walk away.

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:21.900
Lyons, you—

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.060
You are not good at this.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.540
Go into the water now, please.

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:27.100
Just go.

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:27.740
Just go—

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.780
OH GOD!

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.740
OH GOD!

01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:46.940
I'd also like to thank Jenny Angel, CavP, Kevin M. Knippy, MK, Malick Malachi-Robinson,

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:52.140
Max Scher, Rob Brunt, Simon AJ, and Tom Cameron.

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:54.060
I'd also like to apologize.

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.300
I split the people I was thanking per video in half

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.260
because I thought I was going to get the other half thanked in this video,

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:01.740
and then I went way over the end of the month.

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.340
Everyone who backed me last month,

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:05.020
and everyone who backed me this month,

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:06.940
went way over the end of the month.

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.740
Everyone who backed me last month will get thanked this month

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:12.540
in the two videos coming up soon.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.220
This one just took a lot longer than I thought,

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.420
and I had to help with the funeral.

01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.860
It was a whole thing.

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.820
Next time I do one of these,

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:20.540
I kind of want to talk about the philosophy of Dark Souls 2,

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.980
or why Bloodborne is the best-designed Souls game in terms of introducing it to new players.

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.620
Click on—

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.660
No, I don't have to do those.

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:29.900
Just let me know in the comments which you'd prefer.

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.900
Or, you know, suggest a new thing.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:32.860
I don't mind.

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.380
You know, I'm out of ideas.
