1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Oh, God, a bunch of people voted for each video, and I can't be bothered to counter them.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,700
Hold on, I'm just gonna flip a coin.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,460
Oh, fuck. Ugh.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,660
It's gone behind my fucking desk.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,980
Fallout 3 is garbage, and here's why.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,520
♪

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,420
♪

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,900
The first two Fallouts comprise some of the best games ever.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,260
Virtually nothing else comes close.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,440
Okay, let me be more specific.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,280
Three games come close.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,840
Oh, wait, what's this? Ignore this, forget about that.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,840
And all three of them are made by people who worked on Fallout.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,160
And they're also by companies that no longer really exist.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,720
These types of games are very thin on the ground, and don't ever do as well as they deserve to.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm gonna talk about what makes the first two Fallout games good a lot in this video,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,200
but it's important to keep in mind that even without comparisons to the previous games,

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,760
Fallout 3 fails on its own merits, too.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,160
In an attempt to remain balanced,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,840
I looked up some reviews by more professional reviewers in the business at the time the game came out.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,600
After carefully perusing as many reviews as I can,

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,520
I've isolated three key facts about the game.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,000
Fact one, the VATS system looks totally badass.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,440
No written or video review can shy away from mentioning this and showing you in graphic detail.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
Yeah!

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,080
Yeah!

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,560
Woo!

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Oh, oh, oh, murder! Woo!

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Yee! Woo!

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,520
Yee-juh!

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,880
Uh-juh...

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Mm-mm-mm...

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,240
Mm-mm-mm, VATS is still happening.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,480
This is all footage from one review.

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,760
They just kept showing it.

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,840
This is all there is of Fallout.

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,400
This is the part that people like.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
What about the nuanced storytelling?

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,440
Who gives a shit?

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Fact two, there are some audiovisual problems on the PS3 version, which also drops frames quite often.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,280
The jagged edges, washed-out lighting, and slightly diminished draw distance of the PS3 release aren't so easy to dismiss.

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,400
We also experienced a number of visual bugs on that platform.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,240
And of course, fact three, game reviewers must be purged.

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,600
No, seriously, the IGN review of Fallout 3 talks about how fucking deep and intricate the morality system is

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,800
and that doing bad things can have dangerous long-lasting effects.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,480
He says this over footage of his character picking up a fork,

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,040
and as all the objects on the table bizarrely float around for no reason,

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,120
the entire city begins to shoot him to death for theft.

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,240
And the game has an awesome climax that we won't spoil for you here.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,200
The IGN reviewer also thinks the ending was good,

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,320
the one thing literally everyone disagrees with.

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,200
If you think the ending is good, you're actually wrong.

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,080
You don't.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,840
That didn't happen. You hated it.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,720
Shut up.

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,080
But no matter which system you own, you should play Fallout 3,

57
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,840
which overcomes its issues by offering a deep and involving journey through a world that's hard to forget.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,960
Kevin, you're calling the game deep and involving over footage of you

59
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,000
friendly-firing your fucking allies for no reason.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,840
That guy shows up to help you.

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,560
And I had hoped to assist in your rescue.

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,440
And he's attacking him just because.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,040
Taking even the briefest glance at the game criticism industry at the time this game came out

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,920
reveals it's just a cavalcade of fucking crazy people who think that

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,720
do you want to kill a whole town of people or not is a deep question.

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
Oh my god.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Game journalism is unethical.

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,200
The whole thing is a fucking nightmare mess.

69
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,080
So we have to stop them.

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
We have to stop this.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,080
How can anyone think this about?

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
In an attempt to present fairness,

73
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,600
I am going to start by listing out some of the things I liked about Fallout 3.

74
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,840
I'm not against the game being turned into an FPS.

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,960
A huge portion of the core engine, even though I'm going to complain about it later,

76
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,640
isn't actually all that bad if you strip away the bad things built on top of it.

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,520
Fallout 3 has a solid base in there somewhere.

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,400
I like that.

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,560
I especially like that you can target the weapon in someone's hands and knock it out.

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
It's a fun strategic move.

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,520
If you ever played Perfect Dark and shot a gun out of someone's hand,

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,840
it gave you a rush no other game could provide until Fallout 3 had it, which was neat.

83
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,960
I still wish you could go for the eyes, though, like in the originals.

84
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,440
I also wish the AI wasn't fucking terrible.

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,400
I guess the other guy's gonna take cover or maybe duck in and out.

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,360
Oh no, here he comes.

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,440
I am just holding block with the sword I found on the body next to these people.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
I could be wrong, but it looks like the sword is hurting them

89
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,720
as much as it's hurting me when they try punching it.

90
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,800
Stand still!

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,680
I am!

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Yeah, there are some occasionally funny moments or decent bits

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,960
mixed in with the garbage we're getting too soon.

94
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,400
The robot assuring you that the bomb is perfectly safe, we promise,

95
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,840
before you even know there's a bomb is pretty impressive as an opener.

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,600
And it's an impressive closer for Megaton, too, if you decide to blow it up.

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Also, the sniper guarding the town, who you can't reach without cheats

98
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,920
and seems to know this.

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,840
Hey, wait a minute.

100
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,160
Megaton's a little different from up here.

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,200
What is this?

102
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,920
Morrowind?

103
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,880
The funniest thing in the game is at Raven Rock, the Enclave base.

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,600
You'll notice the mess hall floor is a metal grating.

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,840
Well, if you go underneath it, you'll find a ton of knives and forks.

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,880
People kept dropping them and losing them down the grating.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560
That's fucking amazing!

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,920
It's spectacular!

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,360
It's the single humanizing moment the Enclave get in the entire fucking game,

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,640
and I love it.

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,080
If Fallout 3 consisted entirely of moments like this, it would be the best game ever made.

112
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,280
There are some characters I like.

113
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,160
Not many.

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,360
I like Moira.

115
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,240
She's interesting, quirky, has a personality,

116
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,520
and she's probably the character you can have the most varied relationship with.

117
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,680
By which I mean you can do the quest for her and make her happy.

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,360
You can do the quest even better and make her happier.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,120
You can crush her dreams by talking her out of her ideas,

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,960
or you can nuke her fucking town and then say hi to her later

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,600
and carry on as if it didn't happen.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,640
That's almost depth.

123
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
I like, um...

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,680
What's his name?

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,720
I like General Jing Wei from the Operation Anchorage DLC.

126
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,200
He's an incredibly one-dimensional character,

127
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,040
but he is the one permitted one-dimensional character,

128
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,200
unlike all the others in the rest of the game,

129
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,920
because he's literally a racist caricature in a simulation created by Americans

130
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,880
to train soldiers to want to kill Chinese people.

131
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,960
You can literally convince him in one sentence to commit suicide,

132
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,080
which unfortunately isn't far off from how you talk to real characters in the rest of Fallout 3,

133
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,800
but it's still funny because it reminds you how messed up the creators of the simulation were

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,640
and how obsessed they thought the Chinese were with honor.

135
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
And also the line,

136
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,640
I'm going to kill you so much is pretty funny.

137
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,320
And, um...

138
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,760
That's not it?

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,960
Are those all the characters?

140
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,920
Oh, shit, no, wait!

141
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,880
The medic armor!

142
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,240
The medic armor from the basement of old Olney's sewers.

143
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,080
Listen up, you goddamn puke!

144
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,800
You are now wearing prototype medic power armor!

145
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
You take care of me, and I'll take care of you!

146
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,480
That's right, I'm stretching the definition of characters purely to complement a game I don't like.

147
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
That's how seriously I take being fair on a game.

148
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,200
The medic armor is similarly a remnant of a messed up period in American history,

149
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,360
and when you put it on, it starts yelling at you like a cartoonish drill sergeant.

150
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,560
But even better, it ruins stealth on purpose.

151
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,160
If you're near an enemy, it speaks.

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,320
And this attracts enemies.

153
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,720
It literally makes the game harder.

154
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,520
But it's an interesting piece of world building,

155
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,560
and it manages to say something about the culture that built it,

156
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,480
the obnoxiousness of violent American supremacy or whatever.

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,880
And, uh, nope.

158
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Nope.

159
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
That's it.

160
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,880
So two characters and one talking piece of apparel are good.

161
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
And that's it, everybody!

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,880
Don't forget to like, rate, and subscribe before you eat shoots and leaves!

163
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,720
But if you want to take a more critical look at the problems with this game's design,

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,480
and perhaps whittle the act of playing video games itself to the bare knob of its meaning,

165
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,360
stay right there.

166
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,240
Let's go on an adventure.

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,800
4-3 begins with your character's birth.

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,240
The vaginal slit dilates—

169
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,040
That's not what it's called.

170
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,600
Hold on a second.

171
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,520
The cervix dilates, and there we are.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,280
The next hour or so is spent making the character,

173
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,920
picking their stats, and learning the dialogue and VATS systems,

174
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,400
up to the point where it's hard to tell what's going on.

175
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,320
It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.

176
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
It's a lot of fun.

177
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,680
It's a lot of fun.

178
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,240
It's a lot of fun.

179
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,880
It's a lot of fun.

180
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,440
It's a lot of fun.

181
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a lot of fun.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,560
It's a lot of fun.

183
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,040
It's a lot of fun.

184
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,520
It's a lot of fun.

185
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:07,320
Let's think about this for a second.

186
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,400
The protagonist's literal birth

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,960
is the bad joke answer to the question,

188
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,880
where should our story start?

189
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,680
The other problem with this opening is it's fucking boring!

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,920
The stat-picking process takes ages

191
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,120
and corresponds to long scenes of your character growing up,

192
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,240
and nothing major happening and meaningless hijinks

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,800
as you learn how to control a first-person video game.

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,520
You press the WASD keys to move and use the mouse to—

195
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Are you ready to learn you need to click the mouse to shoot yet?

196
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,720
Sorry, Push Mouse 1?

197
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,760
I dunno, maybe we should fuck around at a birthday party some more.

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,360
I genuinely want to know whose idea the opening of the game was.

199
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
Give me their name!

200
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,120
The first Bethesda employee to tell me who

201
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,920
came up with the opening sequence set in an enclosed space

202
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,520
you have zero control over

203
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,920
in their action RPG about having freedom

204
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,800
and making meaningful choices gets to live.

205
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,960
But eventually, the game properly starts

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,600
and you can finally start acting of your own volition.

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Your friend gives you a gun and disappears down the hallway.

208
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
And no, that's not a description of how quickly she moves.

209
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
She's literally gone.

210
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,840
You grab your stuff and go to follow her.

211
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,360
There he is. Hold it right there!

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,560
And it was here, in the first proper room of the game,

213
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,200
that I knew Fallout 3 was going to be a problem.

214
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,880
This is Officer Kendall.

215
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,280
He and all the other cops in the vault beside one

216
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,920
attack you on sight as soon as they see you.

217
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,120
Remember how I just said you can finally act of your own volition?

218
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
That was a lie.

219
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,000
You can't initiate dialogue at all.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,640
The roaches that attack him rarely kill him for you.

221
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,720
And once he kills them, he goes hostile on you.

222
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,800
If you try to run away, he'll chase you.

223
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,120
He'll chase you through the entire vault.

224
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,720
He is dedicated to putting his fingers in your eyes.

225
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,480
No, wait, you can't target those anymore.

226
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,440
Your head, then.

227
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,800
Whatever.

228
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,480
You can talk to Budge,

229
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,200
the fucker who's been bullying you your entire life.

230
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
In fact, you have no choice not to.

231
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,240
He will chase you down to tell you about his mother.

232
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,520
You gotta help me!

233
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,280
But you can't speak to this guy,

234
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,320
who's been a law-abiding citizen and a nice guy vault cop,

235
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,640
who attended your birthday party.

236
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Butch, fucking Butch,

237
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,760
is allowed to have depth and be treated with a range of options.

238
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
You can help him save his mother,

239
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,920
leave her to her fate, or murder him in the head.

240
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,640
This is the closest the game comes to a series of choices,

241
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,840
but the game literally forces you to encounter that choice.

242
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,440
And meanwhile, you don't even get one whatsoever when it comes to Officer Mac.

243
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,760
Is this what Fallout is supposed to be?

244
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
A hallway with enemies to shoot?

245
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,080
That sounds fine for your bog standard action game,

246
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,480
but isn't this supposed to be about having the freedom to choose what sort of person you are?

247
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,840
Because now, no matter what sort of person I turn out to be,

248
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,800
I've already shot a man's fucking head off his body!

249
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,520
Officer Kendall isn't the victim of the Lone Wanderer.

250
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,120
He's a victim of bad writing.

251
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,640
Compare and contrast with your first meeting with a hostile human in, say, Fallout 2.

252
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,480
To continue in your quest, you must defeat me in unarmed combat.

253
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,080
Why do we have to fight?

254
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,840
The path of the Chosen One is not an easy trail to walk, H-Bomb.

255
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,400
This challenge prepares you to face another human,

256
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,760
look him in the eyes,

257
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,920
and know that you may have to kill him.

258
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,120
I disagree with you.

259
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,920
I think that a peaceful solution to any problem is possible.

260
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, see you in shit, police officer!

261
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,960
I literally couldn't even attempt a conversation with.

262
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,440
Say hi to your family at your crappy state funeral I had no choice not to cause.

263
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, and it'll be closed, casket, because this is how firearms work!

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Officer Park is intestines now!

265
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,400
A lot of games make a big deal out of player choice,

266
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,520
but few in recent memory offer so many intricate ways of approaching any given situation.

267
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,960
There are so many options.

268
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,180
Gun.

269
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,780
Bat.

270
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,060
Oh!

271
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,400
Oh! Knife!

272
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,480
Having a conversation with the human beings in front of you with thoughts and dreams and-

273
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,360
It's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and replaying.

274
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,980
Okay?

275
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,340
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

276
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,900
I've come to talk with you again.

277
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,420
If you aren't Butch, this one guard, or the Overseer,

278
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,060
your only meaningful choice is picking which weapon you mash them to death with.

279
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,460
They're treated like the radroaches!

280
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,420
Like I said, the problem with Fallout 3 isn't any one issue.

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,660
Having a long sequence where you play as a baby and pick your stats from little books is fine,

282
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,100
but it's this in tandem with the several other long sequences,

283
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,260
the being told how to click a mouse,

284
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,940
the escape sequence where most players unavoidably killed a bunch of cops

285
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,700
because they weren't given any other choices in this game about having freedom of choice.

286
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,100
The character you build is garbage, too!

287
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,260
They took out all the nuance from it.

288
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,540
They took out the trait system, because traits are scary.

289
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,980
For those of you who don't know,

290
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,900
traits in the first two games are special choices with positive and negative downsides,

291
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,860
which you can start the game with that radically alter the game,

292
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,740
like Jinx, which increases the amount of critical failures everyone, including you, can get,

293
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,100
making the game a hilarious mess of constant suffering!

294
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,180
It's how I make almost every character nowadays,

295
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,220
and it adds yet another layer of possibilities to the proceedings,

296
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,860
as enemies and allies blow the weapons out of their hands

297
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,660
and your dog does such a bad job of biting someone that his leg spontaneously breaks!

298
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,540
But who'd want to risk having funny things happen at random,

299
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,100
or cool risk-reward builds for characters who want to specialize in certain types of skills?

300
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,460
That sounds too fun!

301
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,780
And like it would add too much variety,

302
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,260
that would run the risk of making the vault escape sequence

303
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,500
even a little different every time you do it.

304
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,940
And it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing and replaying.

305
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Worth playing and replaying, eh, Kevin?

306
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,460
Hmm, I wonder if players agree with you—

307
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,020
No, wait! They modded the opening out!

308
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
That's right!

309
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,060
Even players who loved Fallout 3 enough to learn how to make mods for it

310
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,420
think this opening is a heaping pile of garbage trash!

311
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,820
When the game's biggest fans are editing the content out of a game,

312
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,980
that content is probably bad!

313
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,380
Maybe it's wrong of me to harp on the opening so much,

314
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,820
because even at its worst,

315
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,780
it's an hour of boring, repetitive stuff of no consequence,

316
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,980
and then you're done with it.

317
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,140
But it's not that simple, is it?

318
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,860
The sort of people who thought this was an acceptable way

319
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,260
to open their game about freedom and choice

320
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,940
made the rest of the game, too!

321
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,020
Whoever it was whose fault is the opening,

322
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,020
you can see their grubby little piss-stained hands all over the entire game.

323
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,180
So it's worth talking about the opening's problems

324
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,980
because they're a microcosm of Fallout 3 as a whole.

325
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,140
The dad making all the real decisions,

326
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,900
who you're just following around,

327
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,180
and the throwaway characters you won't have any interest in seeing again

328
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,460
all prime you expertly for the shitty game to come.

329
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
So if you can call 3's opening anything,

330
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,660
one word you could call it is honest.

331
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,340
Another word would be shite-arse.

332
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Fallout 3's engine is fairly solid,

333
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,700
but its design is terrible!

334
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,740
Now, I know the lockpicking and hacking minigames are often criticized,

335
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,340
but to be honest, I'm okay with them.

336
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,620
But like the rest of Fallout 3,

337
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,660
their potential is squandered because they aren't used well.

338
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,820
Hacking and lockpicking should be a skill your character has to bother to develop,

339
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,300
which is then rewarded in the form of extra loot,

340
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,060
or the ability to alter a situation,

341
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
or even bypass a trickier fight.

342
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,820
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

343
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,580
But let's look at their actual use in the opening.

344
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,500
To access the Overseer's chamber,

345
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,100
you could pick the very easy, almost impossible-to-fail lock,

346
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,180
or you could open the dresser drawer one room away and take the key.

347
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,020
To access the Overseer's computer,

348
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,100
you could do the hacking minigame,

349
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,540
or you could open the drawer directly next to the computer

350
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,380
and obtain the password directly.

351
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,900
While this is probably done to teach the player that hacking and lockpicking are useful,

352
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,620
but can sometimes be circumvented by resource-worn games,

353
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,580
circumvented by resourcefulness and being aware of your environment,

354
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,580
they impart the far stupider lesson that hacking and lockpicking is pointless,

355
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,060
and you'll be able to skip them incredibly easily.

356
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,900
So, players are ingrained with the belief that these minigames can be avoided,

357
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,980
and you ought to look for ways to do so.

358
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,220
I think that's why people criticize them so much.

359
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,820
Not because they're directly bad,

360
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,140
but because the game itself teaches you that you should avoid doing them if you can.

361
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,060
Even when you do get out of the vault,

362
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,100
Fallout 3's wasteland is big and very pretty at times,

363
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,340
but fails to feel like a world because of some very bad design decisions.

364
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,340
You're simultaneously too free and have no choices.

365
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,540
I know that doesn't make any sense, but we'll get to it, okay? Trust me.

366
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,900
The world is really open.

367
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,180
You can, technically, go anywhere in the world immediately.

368
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,820
The developers seem to have actively wanted this to be the case,

369
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
so they designed the world around this.

370
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,100
Consequently, all the areas feel roughly the same.

371
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,620
An open-world shooter can be structured well, like Stalker,

372
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,580
which, for example, put harder and stronger enemies in later areas

373
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,940
because you've become better at playing and found better equipment.

374
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,340
The world is designed so, while you can technically come to harder areas very quickly,

375
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,060
simply getting there requires skills or weaponry you will get your hands on on the way over.

376
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,460
No matter how you play Stalker, the game is arranged so that if you're playing properly,

377
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,500
you're never in a position where you're at a tremendous disadvantage,

378
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,940
and more difficult areas are discouraged by being harder to do early on,

379
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
while still being technically doable.

380
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,700
You can assault the army base right next to the start of the game straight away,

381
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,180
but you have to be really good to be able to do it.

382
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,300
This creates a sense of friction and challenge and fun

383
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,620
where the player's ability is being tested.

384
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,420
Assaulting the army base in Stalker is just great.

385
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,220
I love it.

386
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,060
And it's—it's—it's—

387
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,740
AAAAAAHHHHHHHH

388
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,020
Players don't usually think about these elements of games, especially shooters,

389
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,260
but the design of the progression and the pacing is what makes a game fun.

390
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,820
Fallout 3's world is designed for almost every area to be accessible to anyone at any time.

391
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,980
This means that the developers had to avoid making an area the player could go too early,

392
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,900
which let me remind you is anywhere, too hard, so most—

393
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,180
no, let's be honest, all enemies and characters in the game have fairly low-quality equipment and stats,

394
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,820
and no lockpicks or hacking minigames in your path require much skill to activate.

395
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,980
This practically eliminates any sense of pace or rising action or difficulty.

396
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,820
Once you've dealt with a couple of packs of raiders and leveled up just a little,

397
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,940
or if you stopped off at Moira's for the rocket launcher early on,

398
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,260
90% of the game is a splashy meat fest where nothing could really challenge you,

399
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,740
rendering almost the entire game dull.

400
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,980
A good game is like a three-course meal.

401
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,180
You have your salad, your main, and your dessert.

402
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,420
Fallout 3 is one massive salad,

403
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,700
and you only need to have a little bit of salad before you wish the waiter would bring you your fucking spaghetti!

404
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,020
A ton of popular gameplay mods for Fallout 3 make the game harder in various ways,

405
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,660
with more realistic weapon damage, or harder enemies,

406
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,780
or adding more mechanics the player has to deal with to survive,

407
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,380
and this is because past a certain point,

408
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,900
you're gonna need that stuff for the game to be challenging in the slightest.

409
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,820
Once again, modders are having to do the developers' jobs for them.

410
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,940
The most popular of these, Fallout 3 Wanderer's Edition,

411
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,420
also adds the ability to skip the opening,

412
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
because of course it would!

413
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,940
Whoever designed this mod should have made Fallout 3!

414
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,980
The place where you should be able to expect the enemies and their skills,

415
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,020
weapons, and armor to really get more difficult is the main story,

416
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,140
but the developers had no way of knowing what level the player would be

417
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,500
when they were doing the main story,

418
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,580
and wanted to make sure players didn't get stuck,

419
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,180
so once the Enclave turn up,

420
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,380
not only do they engage you in small enough numbers that they're not a problem,

421
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,900
even at quite a low level,

422
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,860
but once you encounter them in greater numbers close to the climax,

423
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,660
there's invariably something else shooting at them for you,

424
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,140
like Liberty Prime, or the Brotherhood of Steel,

425
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,860
or Forks, or the turrets in the Enclave base.

426
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,420
So even the hard enemies aren't hard.

427
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,340
Well, at least the robots are having a fun combat experience here.

428
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,940
It's possible to beat a huge portion of the larger set pieces

429
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,380
without firing a single shot,

430
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,700
because your allies are invincible and overpowered

431
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,780
in order to make sure the plot gets pushed forward.

432
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,300
In fact, in the final mission,

433
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,980
if you're a melee weapons character,

434
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,540
the real challenge is to kill anyone yourself,

435
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,500
so you're totally free to take part in the game's story,

436
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,740
but don't ever have any influence over it in terms of story or gameplay.

437
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,740
So in other words, you're too free and have no choices.

438
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Do you get it? It all made sense.

439
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,780
There are a couple of areas that are suddenly very difficult.

440
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,780
For example, the old Olney Sewers I mentioned before are a nightmare mess.

441
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,700
The deathclaws are really powerful,

442
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,580
making the area the most challenging one in the entire game,

443
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,300
and literally impossible if you went to it early on.

444
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,700
The reward is a suit of power armor that's no better

445
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,940
than the armor you'd need to be wearing to get to it,

446
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,700
which, by the way, is still overpowered

447
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,180
for the entirety of the rest of Fallout 3's world.

448
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,780
If you're gonna have an area like this,

449
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,500
you should probably put it somewhere only late-game players can get to

450
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,100
so they don't get murdered over and over

451
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,020
expecting it to be like the rest of the game,

452
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,100
but no, it's just sitting there.

453
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,140
Worse off, it's not even leveled to the areas around it.

454
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,900
Right next to it, further away from where you start the game,

455
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,500
is the Republic of Dave,

456
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,260
It's a fun little area with its own, like, weird democracy thing going on,

457
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,860
but there's only five characters in it.

458
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,140
It's really fun.

459
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,060
The Republic of Dave is, like Olney,

460
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,780
one of the few truly cool areas in the game,

461
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,220
but they're the two areas that shouldn't be right next to each other!

462
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,780
They should be on opposite sides of the map!

463
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,180
These areas are two of my three favorites in the game,

464
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,100
and they're both shoved off to the side right next to each other like an afterthought.

465
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,580
A game that properly paced itself would arrange its map

466
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,900
so you encountered the latter very early on,

467
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,060
and the former much, much later,

468
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,140
when, in fact, the opposite happens.

469
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,300
Speaking of badly thought-out gameplay,

470
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,460
thanks to the poor visual design and writing,

471
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,940
it's often very difficult to know how to get somewhere

472
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,380
once you decide where you want to go,

473
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,260
or what exactly to do when you're doing a quest.

474
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,340
The world is so big and full of junk that,

475
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,140
for most of the game, if you're doing a story or optional quest,

476
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,020
you can't rely on the game to tell you where to head visually.

477
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,340
You have to look at the arrow on your radar.

478
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,020
And down here is the biggest travesty in the history of video games.

479
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,180
Okay, it's not that bad, but it's pretty bad.

480
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,580
A good game can tell you where to go effortlessly through the design of its levels,

481
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,500
or by giving you enough directions that you can put the pieces together yourself.

482
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,860
This is good because it encourages the player to be aware of their surroundings,

483
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,820
which lets them fully appreciate the worlds the designers have built

484
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
and all the neat personal touches to it.

485
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,780
When you build a world centered around giving them a blip on their radar

486
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
to walk towards in a straight line,

487
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,820
you hamstring not just their own sense of going on their own journey

488
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
and making their own decisions,

489
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,140
but you've created a situation where the game is teaching you to follow this with your brain.

490
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,700
Your eyes are trained to follow it, to stare at it, to just go where it tells you to.

491
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,460
The levels can be often quite nice-looking, with fun little things to look at,

492
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,100
but your eyes are here at all times.

493
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,260
You probably didn't even notice you were doing it,

494
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,140
but the game's objective marker slowly turns you into an idiot

495
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,220
with no awareness of your surroundings.

496
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,220
Here's a review from 2014.

497
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,420
Also, like, stuff like, you thought Liberty Prime was sick.

498
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,140
I thought it was awesome because he was there the whole time

499
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,660
and you never paid attention to him.

500
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,020
Liberty Prime is a gigantic fucking robot!

501
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,180
You have a bunch of opportunities to see it.

502
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,780
You cannot avoid seeing it when you walk into the room!

503
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,260
It is literally impossible!

504
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,140
And yet, somehow, these players missed it

505
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,140
until it was the thing you were following for the last quest as it did all the work.

506
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,020
I'm not calling these guys stupid, they're pretty funny and smart.

507
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm saying Fallout 3 is so stupid by design

508
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,540
that it teaches players not to notice things that are otherwise quite easy just to look at

509
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,740
and see with your human eyes!

510
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,700
In previous Fallouts, if you don't have your wits about you,

511
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
you're not gonna see what you need to see.

512
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,260
It trained you to develop an awareness of your surroundings,

513
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,260
and thus, A, make you feel awesome when you figure out a way of doing things

514
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,540
that wasn't obvious or literally just told to you by the game,

515
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,780
it made you feel like you'd solved a puzzle,

516
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,380
and B, it gave you an appreciation of the design of the world.

517
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,420
Remember the forks under the mess hall in the Enclave base?

518
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,780
How many players do you think noticed that or realized why?

519
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,780
This is an uncharacteristically cool and funny and human piece of world-building,

520
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,380
but the game was seemingly designed around making sure you don't see it

521
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,220
because you're too busy looking at this,

522
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,700
the one thing telling you where you're supposed to go.

523
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,420
I remember in the other Fallout games and Planescape Torment

524
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,580
getting given strict directions like

525
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,540
go down the street and take the second left to get to my friend's house.

526
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,300
You have to navigate a street.

527
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,740
At one point in Fallout 2,

528
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,980
a guy gives you directions to some buried treasure,

529
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,940
and guess what?

530
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,220
He lies.

531
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,340
You have to navigate the world based on some guy's advice,

532
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,180
which might not even be honest.

533
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,140
There wasn't an arrow constantly pointing at your destination.

534
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,460
Conversely, turning this arrow off would render many quests impossible

535
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,220
because figuring out what you have to do and where without this guide

536
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,860
just isn't something the game is equipped to do.

537
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,700
In order to progress the main story,

538
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,100
you have to pick up this tape.

539
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,300
So without the arrow pointing you directly to it,

540
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,740
how would you ever find it?

541
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,420
It's in a giant base.

542
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,620
The Elder Scrolls games, also by Bethesda, have this problem too,

543
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,940
and worst off, Morrowind, the ancient one,

544
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,780
is the one that doesn't have this problem.

545
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
The game left navigation to the player,

546
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,700
and it resulted in a better world.

547
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,500
I haven't finished any of the last three Elder Scrolls games,

548
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,180
but I stuck with Morrowind the longest

549
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,500
because it felt like my adventure,

550
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,980
not an adventure someone else wrote for me,

551
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,020
and certainly not an adventure someone else wrote for a different character

552
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,860
that I'm just sort of there for.

553
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,900
One area of the main story, Vault 87,

554
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,740
doesn't give you a place to go.

555
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,780
You have to look around a big facility to find the GECK,

556
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,740
and guess what?

557
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,860
It's by far one of the most interesting areas of the game

558
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,740
because it had to be designed to lead you where you should look

559
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,100
through sheer design

560
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,460
instead of offering very little in terms of direction or world building

561
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,100
and relying on a heads-up display with an arrow on it.

562
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,820
This forces you to become more aware of your surroundings

563
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,060
and causes you to appreciate the game more.

564
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,500
It's a breath of fresh air.

565
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,700
You notice little things,

566
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,380
like how the mutants keep a leaf blower on the shelf next to the meat.

567
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,820
That's not sanitary.

568
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,260
Meanwhile, in the rest of the game,

569
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,140
players don't notice the giant fucking robot

570
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,940
because they're too busy following arrows to objectives.

571
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,180
Vault 87 is like an intrusion from an alternate reality version of Fallout 3

572
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,100
that was really, really good.

573
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,780
It's also the one place in the game where you can actually talk to a mutant.

574
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,860
Imagine if you could do that with more of them.

575
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,380
But it's not just the way you're led around

576
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,780
or the poor visual design of the world, no.

577
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,180
Fallout 3 is geometrically wrong,

578
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,540
and we're gonna show our working.

579
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,980
Have you packed your protractor?

580
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
Because I didn't, can I borrow yours?

581
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,980
In open-world games, players can theoretically go anywhere right away,

582
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,300
but designers, at least decent ones,

583
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,220
do their best to set out a path

584
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,620
and give you a sense of direction and progression.

585
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,620
This applies also to side quests.

586
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,980
While optional content that doesn't affect the main story is fine,

587
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,260
there are good and bad ways to put this stuff into the player's view.

588
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,660
In Fallout 1, when you're looking for the water chip,

589
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,140
you start off with literally one thing on your map,

590
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,180
just like in 3.

591
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,700
We marked your map with the location of another vault.

592
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,860
Not a bad place to start, I think.

593
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,620
So, you head in this direction.

594
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,420
But what's this?

595
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,060
That's right.

596
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,660
On your direct path to your objective is Shady Sands,

597
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,500
the first populated area.

598
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,940
Do you see what the game's done here?

599
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,020
The game has given you one place to go,

600
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,900
but on your direct route, it's offered you another one.

601
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,260
You could go wherever you want,

602
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,420
wander around, prance off into the wastes.

603
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,660
In fact, you could go to one of the last areas in the game by just walking left.

604
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,140
But with just this one location,

605
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,540
you've actually been shown two places to go.

606
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,580
On top of that, you actually can't get into the vault without a rope.

607
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,620
Luckily, you now know of somewhere where you might find one.

608
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,180
No objective marker needs to pop up to let you

609
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,020
know you need to find a rope with an arrow floating over the people who can sell you one.

610
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,340
You go there, you see you need one,

611
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,180
and then it's up to you to find it.

612
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,500
This establishes a very important narrative and thematic throughline.

613
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,900
You're told to do something or go somewhere,

614
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,220
but doing that isn't so straightforward.

615
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,460
You have to be resourceful to make things work.

616
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,740
The game is saying,

617
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,380
what you have to do is not going to be obvious.

618
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,580
Use your head.

619
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,020
This is capped off by how,

620
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,700
once you do get a rope and descend to the bottom of Vault 15,

621
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,180
you find the lower levels have been completely destroyed,

622
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,340
and you're going to have to search elsewhere.

623
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,260
So the only instruction you've been given leads to a dead end.

624
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,020
None of the people in Shady Sands have probably ever seen a computer in their lives.

625
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,740
You have to find your own leads from here on out.

626
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,340
The game doesn't hold your hand,

627
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,220
but it nudges useful options into your path for you to work with as you see fit.

628
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,420
Now it's just you,

629
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,300
the wasteland,

630
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
and, hopefully, somewhere,

631
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,100
a water chip.

632
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,700
Finding out where one is and figuring out how to get it

633
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,580
forms the basis of the entire first half of the game.

634
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,700
It's a free-form journey you venture on yourself.

635
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,860
Compare and contrast with the search for your dad,

636
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,900
where there's always an objective marker pointing to your next breadcrumb,

637
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,420
which will tell you where to go next,

638
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,020
marked on your radar, of course,

639
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,140
until you find him.

640
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,860
There's no actual adventuring for the player to do.

641
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,780
I think this is why a lot of players ignore the story for a lot of their time playing the game.

642
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,100
The story is so unengaging and requires so little effort or thought on your part

643
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,340
that your brain sort of slides off it,

644
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,700
and you go off to mess about with Tenpenny Tower or those vampire guys,

645
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,420
or just wander around listening to the radio.

646
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,620
Fallout 1 always makes you feel like you're the hero on a journey

647
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,140
by straightforwardly putting the onus on the player to connect the dots

648
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,060
while handing you places to look in an order of increasing complexity and danger

649
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,940
based on where players are most likely to go next in their mission.

650
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,140
It's free-form, and yet it's also subtly structured.

651
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
You're always searching for the water chip,

652
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,620
always on your guard for someone who might happen to be able to help put some pieces of the puzzle together,

653
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,660
and when side quests happen, they're also engaging,

654
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,780
and they're introduced in an organic, entertaining way.

655
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,180
For example, after you've discovered Vault 15's wrecked,

656
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,660
you remember a guy you talked to mentioning trade caravans

657
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,460
that carry water to and from several towns and cities.

658
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,820
So you check out Junk Town.

659
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,420
On the way into the town proper, you hear this guy called Killian is the town's sheriff,

660
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,260
and there's a dude called Gizmo who runs a casino and does crime things.

661
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,460
I go see Killian, who is like a shopkeeper as well as a sheriff,

662
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,700
which is a little weird and control-y,

663
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,300
but he seems nice enough.

664
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,540
Oh, I think I already have.

665
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,700
While he doesn't know anything about the chip or vaults

666
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,020
and actively gets annoyed by vault dwellers who live lives of safety and complacency,

667
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,020
he seems like a nice person and has stuff to sell that can help you out.

668
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Then a guy comes in and tries to murder him.

669
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,780
Holy shi- I'm right here!

670
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,860
I've looked into his dreamy eyes!

671
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,140
You can't do that!

672
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,500
Obviously you help out.

673
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,860
Then Killian's like,

674
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,300
we know Gizmo's behind this,

675
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,500
but we're Law & Order-type guys, so we have to follow procedure.

676
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,220
Next thing you know, you're wiretapping Gizmo's office

677
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,060
or getting him to confess to wanting to murder Killian into a tape recorder.

678
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,180
So, will you do it for me?

679
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,020
Oh yeah, I sure will.

680
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,140
Wait, do you see what the game's done?

681
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,420
You've reached a point where you're pulling classic cop show hijinks,

682
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:48,540
and it all happened completely organically from walking into a store to ask about the water chip.

683
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,740
It's badass!

684
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,700
And the side quest is not only entertaining and fun side content,

685
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,100
but despite being technically totally optional,

686
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,780
the game almost forces you to get involved from how it introduces it to you.

687
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,940
There isn't just an optional dialogue choice where you ask Killian if he has any side quests,

688
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,500
and he's like, yeah, maybe go to a place and shoot some guys and bring me back a MacGuffin.

689
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,060
You get involved with the story of this town simply in the process of walking into it.

690
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,780
Junk Town and Junk Town's completely optional additions to the game are peak game design

691
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,340
because they present themselves to you naturally.

692
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,860
Fallout, despite being made in the 90s before games went mainstream

693
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,260
and simplified themselves for a wider audience,

694
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,980
is incredibly good at getting people into it.

695
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,860
That's why it's so beloved by so many people.

696
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,500
Let's contrast with the first town in Fallout 3.

697
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,780
You go to Megaton because your game's objective marker tells you to.

698
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,220
You walk into a bar and a man says,

699
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,860
I knew your dad and I'll tell you where to go if you do a thing for me.

700
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,980
But if you hack his computer or talk to his employee for five seconds,

701
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,580
you don't need to do that at all.

702
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,380
The most freedom you have in your journey to see your dad

703
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,060
is how much pointless busywork for other people you have to do.

704
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,460
Instead of the options put in your path being different rewards for different actions,

705
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,580
most of the rewards are how much side content you want to skip.

706
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,140
After that, you go to Galaxy News Radio and see Three Dog

707
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,140
because that's what the objective marker says,

708
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,620
and then eventually Three Dog tells you he knows where your dad went.

709
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,020
But first, would you like to do an optional quest for me?

710
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
No? Okay, well, he went to Rivet City.

711
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,060
All right, so you go to Rivet City.

712
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,420
They say he went somewhere else.

713
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,020
You go there, you clear out the mutants there,

714
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,140
your objective marker tells you—

715
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,980
If you are worried about the story, don't be.

716
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,580
It's very well-structured and focused.

717
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,940
And then you go there and blah blah blah,

718
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,580
you're still following this one fucking guy's trail.

719
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,060
Which brings me to the game's biggest single narrative and gameplay problem.

720
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,020
The main character is never the main character.

721
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,180
Your dad is the main character for most of it,

722
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,100
doing his own thing for his own reasons.

723
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,020
All the game's truly big decisions—

724
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,740
the decision to abandon his life's work and raise his son,

725
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,580
the decision to leave and try again,

726
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,940
the decision to kill himself in order to prevent the Enclave from taking over—

727
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,500
you spend too much of this game watching your dad have a much more intricate story.

728
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,980
So, uh, I'm Warsaw here.

729
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,540
It's time.

730
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,900
God damn it, Janice!

731
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,340
What did I tell you about walking to tables in the middle of a fucking cutscene?

732
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,420
The real main characters are talking here!

733
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,020
But even when your dad dies,

734
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,700
you're not left to pick up the pieces and make things work for yourself.

735
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,540
Dr. Li immediately takes over

736
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,780
and starts giving you the orders for where to go next.

737
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,380
We've got to evacuate now.

738
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Don't wander off. We're going to need you.

739
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,060
Jeez, Madison, you don't have to be rude.

740
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,500
I'm standing right here.

741
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,700
This guy knows what's up.

742
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,020
Or he knows something.

743
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,940
Are you all right?

744
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,000
Mate?

745
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,780
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

746
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,140
Here she is convincing the Brotherhood to let you in.

747
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,740
Lions!

748
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,780
I know you're in there!

749
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,740
I know you can hear me!

750
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,820
You open this goddamn door right now!

751
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,260
I guess I'm also here.

752
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm—I'm the player, but we—

753
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,820
And then, when the time finally comes

754
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,300
to take back the memorial and kick the Enclave out,

755
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,940
who gives the triumphant speeches and leads the charge?

756
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,900
Not you!

757
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,940
When we're done with this,

758
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,740
everyone can have a nice cold glass of water on me.

759
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,860
Pry, move out!

760
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,860
Hey, guys, how's it going?

761
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,220
I literally can't even move.

762
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,660
I have to watch this play out exactly how the developers want it to.

763
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,620
The biggest effect you can have on the final mission is

764
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
if you bring an ally in with you,

765
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,140
Lions can't get past them when it takes longer for them to get out of the room.

766
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,060
The final mission is you walking in a straight line,

767
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,620
assisted by the Brotherhood as they kill everyone for you,

768
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,500
and you're all following a robot as he kills everyone else.

769
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,860
I spent a huge portion of this mission trying to score kills of my own,

770
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,380
and I think I got about three.

771
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,180
Oh, come on, guys, no kill-stealing.

772
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,540
That's just rude.

773
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,940
So, apart from a few brief flashes of brilliance like Vault 87,

774
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,260
the entire main story the developers wrote for their game is total garbo,

775
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,660
and barely even actually qualifies as a story.

776
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,820
You're basically a camera with legs who watches a story happen at you.

777
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,140
This makes the player constantly aware that they aren't really taking part in a story.

778
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,620
They're just playing a video game.

779
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,100
Like, I can already imagine an angry comment saying,

780
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,460
He's complaining that people are treating the game like a game, lol!

781
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,060
But bear with me here.

782
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,060
Games, especially role-playing games,

783
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,260
are focused on creating a sense of not simply being in a game,

784
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,140
but of being immersed in an interactive story.

785
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,140
They're emergent from tabletop games like D&D, or in Fallout's case, GURPS.

786
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,220
If someone invited you to their weekly sessions set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland,

787
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,500
and the story was not only weirdly railroady where your character's dad,

788
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,900
who was immortal until his heroic sacrifice,

789
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,100
and some lady in power armor and her pals did all the real work,

790
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,420
and the only way to interact with the other stories in the world

791
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,180
is to ask where the side quests are because you aren't introduced to them organically,

792
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,900
you're not really going to be having a good time, are you?

793
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,060
Core concept? Bottom line?

794
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,420
Fallout 3 fails as an RPG because it fails to make you feel like a person in a world.

795
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,340
What does Fallout 3 have to make up for it?

796
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Well, that's easy. The rocket launcher.

797
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,820
This weapon was touted hugely before it came out.

798
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,300
A physics gun that shoots stuff at people.

799
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,180
How fun!

800
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,780
I'm not saying the rocket launcher's bad.

801
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,420
It's not an inherently stupid thing to add to a game,

802
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,740
but is it the sort of thing you should be adding to your game before the writing,

803
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,820
or storytelling, or game design?

804
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,500
One last big design problem.

805
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,660
Speech as a concept.

806
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,980
Fallout 3 broke it.

807
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,460
In the first two games, dialogue had a lot of sneaky behind-the-scenes stuff going on.

808
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,700
If your character wasn't smart enough to know something,

809
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,940
you couldn't say it in a conversation,

810
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,180
and even then, if you didn't have high enough speech,

811
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,900
the smarter, more convincing options weren't available.

812
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,140
You didn't even see you could make them,

813
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,140
and when they were available, you had to actively choose them yourself.

814
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,660
You were shown a list of options,

815
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,980
and it was up to you to discern what the best,

816
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,500
most persuasive thing to say might be to the character in question.

817
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,140
It was subtle, and awesome.

818
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,100
As always, Fallout 3 ruined everything.

819
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,220
For one thing, they're always openly visible to any player.

820
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,380
No longer is having high speech a nice surprise

821
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,740
that either causes a cool new option to open up and surprise you,

822
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,100
or a backing thing adding to your list of possible options.

823
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,500
The high speech options are always just sitting there,

824
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,060
unsubtle as a gun that shoots junk.

825
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,940
Furthermore, it's not a simple test of your character's skill levels,

826
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,420
or player ability to decide the best answer,

827
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,620
but rather a percentage dice roll based on your skill.

828
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
It even tells you the percentage,

829
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,420
so you can specialize in speech but not roll properly,

830
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,980
or someone else who didn't bother gets lucky with it,

831
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,820
or you can just reload over and over,

832
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,740
which completely defeats the point of having speech checks at all.

833
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,420
Cumulatively, this is a huge problem for the game as a whole.

834
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,300
Conversation is the fundamental medium

835
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,100
through which you experience the Fallout universe,

836
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,580
and the speech ability is perhaps the most useful

837
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,700
and unique thing Fallout ever brought to the table.

838
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,780
Messing this up this badly is a GAME CRIME.

839
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,860
Even without relating to the previous games,

840
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,100
it makes this world feel like it's made of tissue paper,

841
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,020
where if I pass a dice roll,

842
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,180
I can totally alter a person's worldview.

843
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,340
It's unsubtle and completely ill-fitting

844
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
for a game series ostensibly based around

845
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,900
the nuanced frictions between people.

846
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,540
Now let's talk briefly about the weapon degradation system.

847
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,060
It's bad.

848
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,540
No, wait, that's not fair. I'll explain why.

849
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Okay, so I can see what they're going for.

850
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,580
There's quite a good deal of thought going into the system and their execution,

851
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
but like with the way the main quest plays out

852
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,060
and the general landmarkless look of the Wasteland,

853
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,060
it isn't quite done right.

854
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,500
The idea is that your weapons are old and breaking and need to be repaired,

855
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,860
not just to continue working,

856
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,020
but because their condition affects their damage.

857
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,300
A fully functioning pistol is better than one that's falling apart.

858
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,780
You have a repair stat that allows you to take two of a weapon

859
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,860
and turn them into one better weapon,

860
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,380
but you need to get your stat higher

861
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,860
to get things beyond a certain quality threshold.

862
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,860
This means that as your character progresses,

863
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,820
you don't just get stronger by having more points in guns,

864
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,140
but you also end up with higher quality weapons

865
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,380
that improve your damage output even further.

866
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,980
This, so far, is fine.

867
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,300
But there's another layer of design

868
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,860
that has to go into the game when you add this system in.

869
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,020
Since weapons break and can't be used until they're repaired if they hit zero condition,

870
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,300
the developers can put more powerful weapons in early game areas

871
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,100
in order to give you a taste of the direction the game's gonna go,

872
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,060
or give you something powerful but that you can only use a few times

873
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,460
so you can save it for more difficult moments.

874
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,500
So, lots of powerful weapons can be discovered early on

875
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,260
and give you a taste of things to come,

876
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,780
but have to be used sparingly.

877
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,640
Wait.

878
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,540
Can you see the contradiction here?

879
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,460
Powerful weapons being given to you early in low condition

880
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,980
because they can't be used too much,

881
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,220
and weapons that get weaker when they're in lower condition?

882
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,660
These two things don't go well together.

883
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,580
This means that the game ends up handing you a weapon

884
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,140
that's about as weak as all your other weapons.

885
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,020
You can find laser pistols in the Mart outside Megaton,

886
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,980
but guess what?

887
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,540
At this point, you probably haven't put much points into energy weapons

888
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,620
because you haven't even seen one yet,

889
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,700
and they're in such low condition

890
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,580
that they're equivalent to the weapons you were already using.

891
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,180
I've conferred with friends on this,

892
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,140
and several of them were led to believe that laser weapons were useless

893
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
because the ones they found were garbage.

894
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,540
This isn't just me and my weird pals, either.

895
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,580
The internet is really unsure what to think about energy weapons

896
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,060
because the first ones you encounter are terrible.

897
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,700
Plus, the repair system wasn't great

898
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,980
because you can only repair a weapon if you had another of the same weapon.

899
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,860
A lot of rare and supposedly powerful weapons could

900
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,020
rarely, if ever, be brought up to even a fraction of their actual power.

901
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,100
The only weapon that really survives this ridiculous damage curve is the Fat Man,

902
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,820
simply because it's so over-the-top powerful, even in a near-broken state.

903
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,500
The weapon degradation system is yet another pretty good idea

904
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,220
hamstrung by crazy poor execution.

905
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,660
Oh, and by the way,

906
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,700
shooters already had a mechanic for limiting your ability to use a weapon

907
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,780
that was more powerful than your current area.

908
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,540
It's called ammunition.

909
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,260
This is a gameplay feature that's been used in games like Doom

910
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,340
and the Resident Evil series for decades

911
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,380
without, pardon the pun, shooting itself in the foot

912
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,620
by also making the weapons hot garbage equivalents to what you were already using.

913
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,980
They simply rationed out the bullets you were using with them.

914
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,940
Anyway, where were we?

915
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,460
This video is already going to be super long,

916
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,340
so instead of talking at length too much about the morality system,

917
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,060
I'm going to use Vault 101's microcosmic nature

918
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,660
to illustrate the larger problem with Fallout 3's morality on the whole

919
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,180
and then maybe extemporate for a little bit too long anyway about other stuff.

920
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,700
The closest the game really comes to a meaningful decision in Vault 101

921
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,300
is whether or not you kill the Overseer who, by the way, wants you dead.

922
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
He doesn't openly initiate combat with you.

923
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,220
He just calls for your death.

924
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,980
In the middle of me fighting to protect myself from guys I can't talk down,

925
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,900
he engages you in a conversation,

926
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,060
and you finally have the chance to tell someone you don't want to kill them.

927
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,900
If you kill him for being a dick,

928
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,420
a martyr is upset at you.

929
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,100
Oh my god!

930
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,220
Daddy!

931
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,300
The game is using the Overseer's death as a teachable moment.

932
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,980
Killing people makes people sad.

933
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,040
Aww.

934
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,340
Maybe killing people's wrong.

935
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,700
Who appointed you judge, jury, and executioner?

936
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,420
But just wait one backflipping moment.

937
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,540
My mum watches my videos.

938
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,500
I can't swear too much.

939
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,100
That's the lesson I should take from this experience?

940
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,380
Amata, not to be rude,

941
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,980
but do you have any idea how many cops died

942
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,220
because he ordered them to attack me on sight?

943
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,300
And innocent people, too?

944
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,180
There's something insidious and fucked up to Fallout 3's approach to morality.

945
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,980
So many characters are utterly disposable.

946
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,740
Throughout the game, all sorts of people will shoot at you without a second thought,

947
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,260
and you will kill them, or you'll run away, or you'll die.

948
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,060
That's the extent of your moral interaction with a huge portion of the game's characters.

949
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,380
The game could have had a more nuanced perspective,

950
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,140
where the player is, at any point, made to consider that all these people had friends,

951
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,740
and parents, and children,

952
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,140
but instead, being nice is reserved for a couple of specific people,

953
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,660
who are often the most responsible for the problems you experience.

954
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,860
How nice of Bethesda to occasionally let me specifically be nice to one person.

955
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,100
Worse than not even giving you the option of being decent to these guys just doing their jobs,

956
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,660
the game has a fucking pop-up tell you when it deems an action as the right or wrong thing.

957
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,100
Yeah, that's right, let's talk about the amazing karma system.

958
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,940
I kind of feel like any game which can measure your morality with a number

959
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,580
is kind of problematic,

960
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:13,180
because it means, A, it thinks it is the arbiter of when something is a right or wrong decision,

961
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,780
in no uncertain terms,

962
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,060
or B, the game is stupid and so lacking in depth or complexity in its writing

963
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,700
that you really can boil things down that far.

964
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,740
You only really lose karma for stealing,

965
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,100
or for actively killing people who weren't shooting at you first,

966
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,060
but some people you do gain karma for openly killing,

967
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,060
because they're apparently just that bad,

968
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,940
so you can walk into a bar and do this.

969
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,100
But because he's a bad guy, everyone just sort of ignores it.

970
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,100
You gain karma for shooting a man in the face in public.

971
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,620
I did a good thing there.

972
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,140
Meanwhile, with a few specific characters,

973
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,020
often leaders of the groups that are trying to kill you,

974
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,180
the ones who initiate the whole thing,

975
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,340
all of a sudden, you're supposed to consider the importance of human life.

976
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,340
The Overseer is the first in a long line of people who you can spare,

977
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,220
or convince to change their ways, or give up, or whatever,

978
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,100
but who accidentally make the fact you kill your way wantonly

979
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,780
through so many people to get to them fall completely flat.

980
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,820
The player's required to only think about the human effects of their actions

981
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,380
once the game decides it's time to stop and think.

982
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,140
Yes, you can be nice and spare the Overseer.

983
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,060
But that guy's fucked!

984
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,300
Worse than not even giving you a chance to really be a good person,

985
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,900
the game doesn't even really let you be a bad person either.

986
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,140
And by bad person, I don't mean,

987
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,860
whoa, hey, let's kill all these people for no reason.

988
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,940
Whee! I'm so edgy!

989
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,540
My name is not important.

990
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,520
Whee!

991
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,940
I mean as in the game, never, and I do mean never,

992
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,500
puts you in a situation where the lines are blurred,

993
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,060
or where both sides in a conflict have a point,

994
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,980
or are both equally wrong and can be opposed by a superior idea,

995
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,700
or where only you benefit from the arrangement,

996
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,420
but in the long run, this might be better for the world as a whole

997
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,660
because you are, after all, the main character.

998
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,860
You're only ever really being nice, or being a fucking murder man.

999
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,500
That's a job in Fallout!

1000
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,620
Comparatively, in a good game, for example, Fallout 1,

1001
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,980
there's enough of a texture to the problems that are put in your path

1002
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,740
that you can kind of see either side being justifiable.

1003
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,740
If you side in Junk Town with Gizmo,

1004
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,060
who's quite straightforwardly a self-interested dick

1005
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,260
who wants the sheriff dead because it's bad for his business...

1006
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,220
I want him dead because he cramps my business.

1007
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,180
...Junk Town gets better.

1008
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,940
It grows and becomes a far more successful town than it could have been before.

1009
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,020
While I don't personally think it's a good choice,

1010
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,660
there's enough room here that I could see someone

1011
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,260
with different socio-political beliefs than me making a convincing argument

1012
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,220
that Gizmo's version of Junk Town is a more prosperous one

1013
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
that's ultimately better for the people in it.

1014
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,540
That's right! Fallout 1 managed to give you options

1015
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,340
where the right answer can depend on what you personally think is best for humanity!

1016
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,780
And speaking of the towns made of junk that you encounter in the beginning of the game,

1017
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,500
Fallout 3 attempts a similar choice with Megaton.

1018
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,180
You can either make the bomb safe and help the people a little,

1019
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,700
or blow the whole town to fucking smithereens.

1020
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,940
Wait, what?!

1021
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,620
That's right! Fallout 3's version of a nuanced moral choice is

1022
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,060
do you want to kill a bunch of innocent people or not?

1023
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,860
Is killing people for no reason okay?

1024
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,300
What a complex question!

1025
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,260
How deep?

1026
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,540
Ten out of ten!

1027
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,900
The nuke really well illustrates my problem with the game's moral system.

1028
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,260
You walk into a town, and a guy motions you over and says,

1029
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,780
hey, you want to kill everyone?

1030
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,140
I know you have no reason to want this,

1031
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,060
and to be honest, neither do I.

1032
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,660
But, and to be even more honest,

1033
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,940
neither does the guy I work for.

1034
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,300
His reasoning's really poor,

1035
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,420
but you'll feel like you're having an effect on the world, right?

1036
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,220
And since Megaton is a town that can theoretically be blown up

1037
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,140
very early in the game's story,

1038
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,700
none of the characters in it actually matter very much.

1039
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,900
They aren't allowed to.

1040
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
Like in other shitty games with bad writing,

1041
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,420
characters who might optionally die are often bad characters,

1042
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,020
because when they live,

1043
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,140
they can't be permitted to do anything useful or relevant to the story,

1044
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,780
because then you'd have to write the version where that doesn't happen,

1045
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,540
and that can require a lot of rewriting to account for both versions and so on.

1046
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,060
In Mass Effect 1, for example,

1047
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,980
you have the ability to let the entire council

1048
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,300
that's been giving you orders the whole game die.

1049
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,020
In the sequel, the council barely even comes up,

1050
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,220
whether they lived or not.

1051
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,060
This is because accounting for the deaths

1052
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,460
of the most important people in a political system

1053
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,740
is actually really difficult

1054
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,140
if you then also have to account for them not dying.

1055
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,740
By the time of Mass Effect 3,

1056
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,700
Bioware fucking gave up on the idea of players having freedom,

1057
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,060
and if you killed the council,

1058
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,940
they get replaced by almost identical-looking copies

1059
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,860
who are virtually no different.

1060
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,380
You're essentially getting to choose what outfit the council is wearing,

1061
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,900
so it becomes a decision that's ultimately set-dressing

1062
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,500
for what some of the people you talk to on the space telephone look like.

1063
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,540
Much like that decision, Fallout 3 renders its first town

1064
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,620
practically meaningless on purpose,

1065
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,780
because nothing of value can be at risk of having an effect on the wider story.

1066
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,700
Even your dad doesn't get that mad

1067
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,740
that you blew up a town and killed a bunch of people for no reason.

1068
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,980
You're still my son, and I love you,

1069
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,020
but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.

1070
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,140
We'll talk more about this when there's time.

1071
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,700
What—what do you have to do to get this guy to hate you?

1072
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,860
Ironically, the most nuanced and interesting character in the game to me, Moira,

1073
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,180
actually does survive this incident,

1074
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,060
presumably because the developers put so much effort

1075
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,900
into her long and varied quest

1076
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,700
that they didn't want to risk players missing out on it,

1077
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,260
so, effectively, walking into Megaton and shooting Moira in the head

1078
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,100
has worse consequences for your future options

1079
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,580
than blowing up the entire fucking town with a bomb.

1080
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,420
Nice job, Bethesda.

1081
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,940
Hey, Moira, if you can hear me, I found that landmine you wanted.

1082
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,220
I'll bring it over.

1083
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,380
Keep working on the survival guide!

1084
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,300
They could have built an area that arguably deserved to be destroyed,

1085
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,380
maybe because it relied on slavery

1086
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,500
and was planning on expanding and causing more harm to others.

1087
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,020
The player would have to weigh up the cost of invoking the nuclear option,

1088
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,580
the innocents and slaves caught in the crossfire,

1089
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,740
and possibly explore alternatives and live with those choices,

1090
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,460
but instead they built a normal town and said,

1091
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,380
hey, you want to blow it up for no reason?

1092
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,740
The Be Good or Be History's Greatest Monster choice

1093
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,860
is the only consistent set of choices you're given in the game.

1094
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,300
Towards the end, you have the option of putting a virus in the wasteland's water

1095
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,620
that purposefully makes it so that every mutant is probably going to die,

1096
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,620
and the person who gives you this option

1097
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,460
doesn't give you anywhere near a decent justification for this being a good idea.

1098
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,820
We're going to come back to this later,

1099
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,700
but the specific and consistent issue in this game

1100
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,900
is that you can't really be a good person or a bad person

1101
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,460
because there are no situations in which you have to decide what you think is best.

1102
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,260
There are only objectively good or bad decisions.

1103
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,500
I've chosen to play as a good guy this time.

1104
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,380
Ooh, I wonder what being a murderer is like.

1105
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,860
You leave the safety of your vault into this world, you know?

1106
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,140
You're a big decision.

1107
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,380
Am I going to help these people, or am I going to, you know,

1108
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,780
do my own thing and serve my own selfish needs?

1109
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,340
Help people or do my own thing.

1110
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,860
Those aren't real choices.

1111
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,740
What about giving the player different ways of helping people

1112
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,340
with downsides or risks or wider effects for the rest of the world?

1113
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,660
There's no junk town scenario where you have to at least stop to consider

1114
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,900
that giving Gizmo the power to pursue his business

1115
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,180
will pull more people into the town and make it stronger

1116
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,100
than the guy who runs the town's police

1117
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,700
and can be kind of iron-fisted about his ideas of what's moral.

1118
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,620
You have to pick a side.

1119
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,060
The end result is the player doesn't feel attached to the world of the game

1120
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,700
because there's nothing that demands any real moral consideration on their part.

1121
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,500
If you've decided to be good, here's all the tips I can give you.

1122
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,980
Don't nuke the town and shoot the bad guys.

1123
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,780
Fallout 3 reuses and references tons of aspects of the previous games,

1124
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,500
which is normally fine, it's in a series,

1125
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,940
but it reuses all of this stuff on a constant basis as a crutch,

1126
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,620
and it never really does any of that old stuff the justice it deserves.

1127
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,940
There are so many things that appear to have been brought back

1128
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,980
simply so the game looks more like a Fallout game,

1129
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,060
not because they actually needed to be there.

1130
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,660
It's not because the game is bad.

1131
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,100
It's because the game is good.

1132
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,700
It's not because the game is bad.

1133
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,620
A Fallout game, not because they actually needed to be there.

1134
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,460
Similarly, the Super Mutants are back.

1135
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,780
I expected this because they've been around since the first game,

1136
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,500
but I didn't expect them to be so poorly done.

1137
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,740
Fallout 1's mutants are dumb and violent,

1138
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,660
but they have a purpose and a goal and a set of beliefs about themselves and the world.

1139
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,620
The Super Mutant is the next advancement in human evolution.

1140
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,020
Soon, everyone in the world will be converted,

1141
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,740
and peace will reign.

1142
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,060
They have a moral code that they believe will lead to peace.

1143
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,620
You don't get the chance to spare any mutants in the first game,

1144
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,140
but you're given ample opportunities to explore why they can't be,

1145
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,380
and why they wouldn't listen to you.

1146
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,300
In 2, the mutants are far less relevant,

1147
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,580
but the final boss is technically a Super Mutant in power armor.

1148
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,860
Otherwise, the mutants you do run into are all a little more chilled out.

1149
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,860
You're talking a long time ago.

1150
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,700
The world's moved on.

1151
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,300
People are racist towards mutants for things that happened a long time before,

1152
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,740
and the mutants secretly still believe that their master plan could have worked.

1153
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,060
There's a texture to them, especially to Marcus,

1154
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,180
who will happily claim he thinks his best human friend

1155
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,140
would be better if they'd been turned into a mutant.

1156
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,300
What a great mutant he would have been.

1157
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,980
There are tensions, and yet there isn't any reason for hostility.

1158
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,900
It's just people with different views and appearances learning slowly to get along.

1159
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,460
In Fallout 3, the mutants are orcs.

1160
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,180
They run around killing people for seemingly no reason.

1161
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
They're dumb. They yell and scream about murder.

1162
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,580
They keep bags of human gore lying around.

1163
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,300
There's no master plan, no explanation, no justification.

1164
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,780
They're raiders, but tinted green.

1165
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,940
They're something for the Brotherhood to be fighting against,

1166
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,700
and we'll get to the fucking Brotherhood.

1167
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,820
The mutants are the most interesting characters in the series to me.

1168
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,780
They live a long time and have a lot to think about.

1169
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,940
Turning them into this is abysmal.

1170
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,260
They needed something for the Super Mutants to do,

1171
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,340
and they needed more things to shoot,

1172
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:11,840
so...

1173
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,460
But it's not just the mutants and the ghouls.

1174
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,980
All kinds of things make a reappearance for seemingly no reason.

1175
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,580
Harold, the mutant who appears in the first two games, is back.

1176
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,980
The Ghek is back, because coming up with another MacGuffin is too much work,

1177
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,820
and everyone knows the Ghek, right?

1178
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,300
Oh, the Enclave are back, because people remember them.

1179
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,980
They're still evil, wow!

1180
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,220
Now you have guys in power armor to shoot.

1181
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,380
Are you feeling serviced, fans?

1182
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,620
Ah, face-to-face, at last.

1183
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,620
Did you think having a conversation with a computer was an original idea?

1184
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,260
Wrong!

1185
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,660
Fucking Zax in the basement of The Glow in Fallout 1 was a talking robot,

1186
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,660
and you could play chess with him,

1187
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,820
and discuss what it means to be human,

1188
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,460
and evolution, and the mutation,

1189
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,060
and the nature of artificial intelligence in infinitely more detail

1190
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,260
than any conversation you can have with John Henry Eden.

1191
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,820
Zax might seem like a minor point,

1192
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,860
but it speaks volumes about the difference in writing quality,

1193
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,860
that while in Fallout 1 you can have longer and more philosophically interesting conversations

1194
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:16,700
than that take place anywhere in Fallout 3 with an optional character,

1195
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,660
I'll bet a huge portion of players never even found.

1196
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,860
And then we have the Brotherhood of Steel.

1197
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,860
Let's go back again.

1198
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,940
In Fallout 1, you barely see much of them for most of the game,

1199
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,740
but their face is looking right at you when you open it.

1200
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,860
They're coming.

1201
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,140
They're coming, oh boy!

1202
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,900
And when you do meet them and you want to join,

1203
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,500
they send you on a suicide mission that they intend for you to die on.

1204
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,060
In fact, when you get there, you find the corpses of the previous people they sent.

1205
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,500
You learn they hoard technology,

1206
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,020
and they're kind of isolationists who believe in keeping track of technology,

1207
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,980
and science, and knowledge in order to preserve it for the future,

1208
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,180
so that the best of humanity can be restored in better days.

1209
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,180
Even though you can gain an understanding of them,

1210
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,100
and convince them to help you a little,

1211
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,300
they ultimately remain hidden underground.

1212
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,260
That's their choice.

1213
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,060
The beautiful, capital-B beautiful thing about the Brotherhood of Steel

1214
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,340
is that they're so human.

1215
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,700
They're likable, they're cool, they're smart, they're powerful, and they're wrong.

1216
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,500
Fallout 2 is the story of their failure to truly help the world or themselves

1217
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
as they wither away into nothingness.

1218
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,980
The title screen of 2 is an enclave soldier.

1219
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,660
The Brotherhood have been replaced as the strongest faction in the Wasteland.

1220
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:32,220
And a loading screen features a tribal in the same pose as the knight from Fallout 1's title screen,

1221
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,220
wearing a desecrated Brotherhood helmet.

1222
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,020
That's some pretty powerful imagery right there,

1223
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,700
especially for a loading screen.

1224
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,540
They were never really the good guys,

1225
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,060
but they did care,

1226
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,700
and you kind of feel sad for their mistakes.

1227
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,140
In Fallout 3, the Brotherhood run around shooting mutants

1228
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,220
because they're the good guys now.

1229
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,980
And no, I'm not saying,

1230
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,020
well, I'm a big baby, you have to do the Brotherhood this way.

1231
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,060
No, they can be any way the writer wants them to.

1232
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,660
They could not even be in a Fallout game because they all died.

1233
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,300
They could be six guys holding on after the end of their whole way of life.

1234
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,180
They could be exactly the sort of group they are in Fallout 3.

1235
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,460
But whatever they are,

1236
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,980
they have to be done well.

1237
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:17,580
None of the Brotherhood are given sufficient levels of characterization or writing or relatability.

1238
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,460
You never really understand these people.

1239
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,900
They feel like props.

1240
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,700
The majority of your interaction with them is part of the main story,

1241
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,580
which we will get to,

1242
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,620
or just kind of uninteresting busywork.

1243
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,220
There's a central area with some generic guys shooting at targets,

1244
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,340
some rooms off to the side with a couple of people you can talk to a little,

1245
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,980
but there's nothing you can really gain from them.

1246
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,140
Nothing really happens here.

1247
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,620
It's like a Brotherhood of Steel-themed attraction at a park.

1248
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,740
It doesn't feel like a place,

1249
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,540
and the Brotherhood doesn't feel like a cohesive group.

1250
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,340
In Fallout 1, the Brotherhood of Steel was a place you could get quite invested in learning about,

1251
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,580
with a multifaceted membership.

1252
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,700
The Brotherhood weren't just a place you could get guns and plot.

1253
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,140
Fallout 1 has talking heads,

1254
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,980
but when you talk to someone occasionally,

1255
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,660
you get a big shot of their face,

1256
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,980
and, uh, ooh, they mouth at you.

1257
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,660
What the bloody, bloody, bloody hell are you doing here?!

1258
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,380
There are four of the game's, what, ten talking heads in the Brotherhood base,

1259
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,700
and all of them have a distinct personality from the moment you walk up to them.

1260
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,740
Greetings. It's a fine day for learning.

1261
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,140
You have Cabot, the obedient, nice, but kind of dumb door guy

1262
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,140
who does the real work of defending the place and hefts the big guns.

1263
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,220
You have Vree, the head scribe who privileges knowledge and invention.

1264
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,660
Speak to the knights.

1265
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,860
Ask them to show you one of the latest laser pistols I designed.

1266
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,660
That's right. In Fallout 1, new things are being made.

1267
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,500
They're not just salvaging old technology,

1268
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,780
in stark contrast to 3,

1269
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:48,140
where all characters are doing nothing but salvage old discarded shit

1270
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,580
and creating nothing of their own.

1271
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,220
Ironically, the same attitude the developers had.

1272
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,340
Vree specifically doesn't think history itself is important.

1273
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:00,300
She's more interested in researching the sciences and discovering the future than in the past.

1274
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,220
You have head paladin Rhombus, a gruff and no-nonsense guy

1275
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:07,500
who doesn't really want to talk to you and directs you to Vree

1276
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,860
if you ask anything sciencey or that requires a long-winded explanation.

1277
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,700
Talk to Vree in the main library.

1278
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,340
He represents the militaristic nature of the Brotherhood

1279
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,740
and their descendants from the US Army.

1280
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:21,980
I could teach you how to fight if you had any ability.

1281
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,980
You have General Maxson, the High Elder,

1282
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,300
who manages to have a sense of humour and friendliness,

1283
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,780
but also a sharp wit and an openly militaristic discipline streak to him.

1284
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,980
You can tell just from how he's written

1285
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,020
that he was a fighter himself before he was given command.

1286
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,940
He's a leader who embodies a nice mix of the traits of the other three characters.

1287
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,380
This gives you a sense that the Brotherhood at its core really is a brotherhood,

1288
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,180
a fraternity of people who take care of each other

1289
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,420
and are ultimately very close-knit,

1290
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,460
not just visible in their constant worrying about the missing knights

1291
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,860
who went out on an expedition whose trail you can pick up on and eventually rescue,

1292
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,540
but in things as simple as how their leader comprises a mix

1293
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,940
of all of their attitudes and beliefs.

1294
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,820
The Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 1 gives a convincing impression

1295
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,900
of a functioning mini-society,

1296
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:12,780
creating a sense of a vast group of different intersecting personalities within their halls,

1297
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,420
and it does it with four faces.

1298
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,700
Every single member of the Brotherhood in Fallout 3 has a face,

1299
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,740
but they barely have one personality between them.

1300
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,380
The Brotherhood is at your service.

1301
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,060
The Brotherhood is at your service.

1302
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,300
You can shoot them into tiny pieces of carefully modelled meat,

1303
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,580
but you can't have a meaningful conversation about science with them.

1304
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,100
It's very clear that Bethesda wanted to do their own versions

1305
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,340
of Maxson, Rhombus, Vree, and Cabot,

1306
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:43,260
either as yet another reference or because they genuinely had no ideas of their own,

1307
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,420
so here's a test of these new characters.

1308
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,260
What's this guy's name?

1309
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,740
What sort of personality does he have besides generic door guard?

1310
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:57,020
Cabot's name has been burned into my brain since I played Fallout 1 about 14 years ago.

1311
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,740
He had a lovely, unassuming nature,

1312
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,500
a uniquely shaped head,

1313
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,220
and represented not only the Brotherhood's defensiveness,

1314
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,540
but their inner kindness to one another.

1315
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,700
I want to take Cabot for a walk on the beach and just talk about stuff for a while.

1316
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,380
Fallout 3 was a chance to show a chapter of the Brotherhood that had redeemed themselves,

1317
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,700
where they saw the result of their foolishness coming

1318
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,220
and decided to help the people of the Wasteland form a better society,

1319
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,060
but instead they're a confusing mishmash of their presentation in the first two games,

1320
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,540
being rude to outsiders, not letting anyone in,

1321
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,060
with cookie-cutter,

1322
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,580
maybe being nice to people is a good thing nonsense mixed in with it.

1323
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,540
None of them offer any real justification for this change,

1324
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,620
and even as characters in themselves,

1325
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:40,620
none of them even say anything as flavourful and character-establishing

1326
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,580
as it's a fine day for learning.

1327
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,940
So there.

1328
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,780
I hope that makes me seem not against changing the Brotherhood on principle,

1329
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,260
just against changing it badly and not giving them enough characterisation or justification

1330
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,420
for why they are how they are.

1331
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,660
Just like how I'm not strictly against the idea of there being a Mega Man cartoon,

1332
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,500
but that doesn't mean I'm okay with...

1333
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,660
♪ Super-flying robot! ♪

1334
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,300
♪ Yeah, yeah! ♪

1335
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,780
♪ Super-flying robot! ♪

1336
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:12,620
The re-use of old concepts smacks, like with the opening birth scene,

1337
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,740
of hasty attempts at storytelling and world-building.

1338
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,540
It's as if the developers were handed the rights to three,

1339
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,140
and they knew they had to make a game,

1340
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,620
but not what should actually go into it,

1341
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,660
resulting in a cobbled-together mishmash of whatever

1342
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,780
original ideas they came up with in some initial meeting,

1343
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,620
and ideas borrowed from the other games but given no real thought.

1344
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:37,820
The Fallout series is characterised largely not by adherence to a core set of concepts,

1345
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,260
but by change.

1346
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,780
War never changes, but the world the war is fought in does.

1347
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,100
In Fallout 2, things changed.

1348
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,060
The Super Mutants weren't trying to conquer the world in the name of progress,

1349
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,380
they were survivors of a dead ideology,

1350
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,860
and the ones left were trying to do good,

1351
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,220
or at least have some peace,

1352
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,660
living in a town founded on the site where a Brotherhood knight

1353
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,900
and a Super Mutant fought for so long

1354
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,140
that they realised how pointless it was,

1355
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,700
and sat down and started working together.

1356
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,020
That sort of concept was unthinkable in the world of the first Fallout.

1357
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:12,540
Things didn't stay the same just for the sake of being like the old one.

1358
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,460
Even the money changed.

1359
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,860
Fallout 3 didn't know what it wanted to be,

1360
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,900
or how to grow or shift or change these things,

1361
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,780
so it ended up playing like a Cliff Notes version of the ideas

1362
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,580
that were popular or well-known in the previous ones.

1363
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,620
Caps are back,

1364
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,460
because caps are a pop-culturally-remembered thing from Fallout 1.

1365
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,500
The Mutants are here, but they're just generic bad guys.

1366
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,900
The Brotherhood of Steel has changed,

1367
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,500
but rather than an interesting or meaningful or fitting change,

1368
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,300
they're boiled down to such goody-two-shoes heroes of the wasteland with no depth

1369
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,420
that they fail to actually progress the Brotherhood thematically.

1370
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,500
They're like a misremembered version of the Brotherhood from the first two games.

1371
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,900
If you boiled it down really, really far down,

1372
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,740
you could have called the Brotherhood the goodies in 1 and 2.

1373
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:00,140
So that's what got translated over.

1374
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,140
It's like playing a game of telephone.

1375
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,020
Ring ring!

1376
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:03,980
Hello?

1377
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,860
What's that?

1378
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
I'm a bad game designer!

1379
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,460
Whaaaaa—

1380
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,140
Todd Howard doesn't sound like that.

1381
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:19,660
But the one thing that makes Fallout truly special is its themes,

1382
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:23,980
its wider story about humans and the problems we face within ourselves

1383
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,220
and how we conquer them and progress to new ones.

1384
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,220
Everyone likes to pretend that their favorite game has—

1385
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,580
Ooh, it's an internal struggle!

1386
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,740
But Fallout gets it real, man!

1387
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,580
Despite being open-world games where the player can go anywhere

1388
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,940
and with stories over which the player has a tremendous amount of influence,

1389
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,540
the original games manage to be incredibly well-structured and paced.

1390
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,580
You start small, getting sucked into the squabble and junk town,

1391
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,220
and then you find yourself inexorably drawn to the hub.

1392
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,660
Each game begins with relative chaos in which everything's up for grabs,

1393
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,500
but there isn't much to grab,

1394
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,380
and you're skirmishing with small groups over petty issues,

1395
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,060
and things are messy and difficult and almost seem to lack a moral dimension

1396
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,420
because you're still making your way and figuring out what's going on

1397
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,740
and getting the equipment you need to save your vault.

1398
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,660
Then, as you get more educated,

1399
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:11,500
you discover areas with complex but identifiable moral problems.

1400
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:16,140
Entire populations are at stake if you execute an idea poorly or take the easy option.

1401
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,580
Getting the water chip can doom the ghoul community of Necropolis

1402
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,820
if you don't help them fix their own water problems,

1403
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:25,100
and their community has members who could do with getting rid of, too,

1404
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,820
not to mention the mutants standing right there!

1405
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,860
Unfortunately for them, we can see an isometric.

1406
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,380
Not every decision is easy,

1407
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,620
but you develop a sense of how to make things right

1408
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,500
and a consideration for the wiser effects of your actions.

1409
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,260
You fight larger and stronger groups,

1410
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,660
and by this point, you're assisted by a crew of your own.

1411
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,980
You get better weapons and armor and more allies.

1412
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,180
You get smart.

1413
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,180
Then, in the final act,

1414
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,860
you get access to amazing technology

1415
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,860
and an incredibly in-depth understanding of why the world is the way it is,

1416
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,980
from speaking to scientists and Zaks.

1417
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,500
The tension keeps rising,

1418
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,580
but all the distractions scale back.

1419
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580
The fate of the world is at stake,

1420
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,780
not because the crosshairs are manually on people like before,

1421
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:08,620
but because you're getting confronted with the questions that lie at the heart of the world,

1422
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,540
and having to come up with a solution to them,

1423
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,620
or everything is fucked.

1424
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,100
Concepts solidify and sides are taken,

1425
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,700
the true motivating forces behind the problems the world face are made known,

1426
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,980
and then,

1427
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,100
finally,

1428
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,100
you go to meet them.

1429
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,060
You make contact with the followers of the Apocalypse,

1430
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,940
a group that has infiltrated the cathedral built on top of the vault

1431
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,060
where the master, the leader of the mutants, is residing.

1432
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,500
They send a lot of help with you,

1433
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,340
and you descend into the corrupted vault,

1434
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,260
covered in proto-Lovecraftian ooze

1435
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,980
and swarming with mutants, monsters, and psychics.

1436
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,980
The final fight is very difficult.

1437
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,260
The mutants are numerous,

1438
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,700
which doesn't go well with the incredible danger even one of them can pose.

1439
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,900
They eventually thin out, but so do your allies.

1440
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,660
This fight seems specifically designed

1441
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,540
so it's a struggle even for the strongest possible character,

1442
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,980
and no one who enters with you will leave alive.

1443
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,420
But eventually,

1444
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,780
the enemies thin out,

1445
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,060
paring away,

1446
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,540
until you're alone in a hallway,

1447
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,020
and at the end is one person.

1448
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:12,300
The entire game is preparing you for the moment

1449
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,820
where you and the master,

1450
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,980
who's been in charge of the entire mutant problem

1451
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,700
that threatens the world with domination this whole time,

1452
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,700
stand in a room together and talk.

1453
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,340
This final hallway tenses me up every time.

1454
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,380
It's a confrontation with a comprehensive belief system

1455
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,860
that so far has been doing really well for itself,

1456
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,060
and you have to stop it,

1457
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,060
or mankind is probably done.

1458
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,540
You've gone from fighting scorpions to getting antidotes

1459
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,060
so someone will sell you a rope

1460
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,260
and slap fights with casino owners over their business practices,

1461
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:42,220
to sitting next to the arbiter of the world's doom

1462
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,860
and trying to explain what is wrong with their plan,

1463
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,700
and it happens seamlessly.

1464
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,620
So what shall it be?

1465
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,380
Do you join the unity,

1466
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,140
or do you die here?

1467
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,300
Everything has been pushing you towards the moment

1468
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,780
when you have to tell the man who thinks he has the solution

1469
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,460
to the problems you've been facing

1470
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,060
that he's wrong.

1471
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,540
These are the crowning moments of Fallout.

1472
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,140
They're the culmination of their story,

1473
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,340
their themes, their ideas,

1474
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,660
and all of your character's choices, too.

1475
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,940
Do you just want to fight them?

1476
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,980
Are you unprepared, making the fight unavoidable and difficult?

1477
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,380
Do you try to talk to them and maybe, just maybe,

1478
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,500
change their mind?

1479
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,740
The conversation with the master is nuts.

1480
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,180
He wants to know where your vault is

1481
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,660
and has a compelling reason you should tell him.

1482
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,820
It's a chance to assure the mutants can be strong enough

1483
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,940
to survive the wastes where mankind has and will not.

1484
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:29,100
As long as there are differences,

1485
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,460
we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other.

1486
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,660
Because there are no obvious speech options popping up with percentiles,

1487
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,500
there's no way of telling what the best way of attempting to talk him down might be

1488
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,340
except for your own judgment.

1489
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,580
You have to engage him as a reasonable person.

1490
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,780
The best thing is,

1491
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,660
it's impossible for him to be talked down on moral grounds.

1492
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,180
He doesn't care about mankind's survival or killing people

1493
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,660
because for him, the mutants are the future of mankind

1494
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,660
and the ends justify the means.

1495
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,300
The only way to talk him down

1496
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,180
is to explain why the plan wouldn't work.

1497
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,780
This isn't just a speech check.

1498
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,740
To do this, you have to ask everyone about the mutants,

1499
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,500
about what makes them what they are.

1500
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,460
Eventually, you can find through Vree that the mutants are sterile,

1501
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,020
and she gives you the evidence that proves this is the case.

1502
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,420
The master rejects this as a forgery anyway.

1503
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,740
You have to get him to ask his own mutants

1504
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,620
if any of them have gotten pregnant before he realizes the truth.

1505
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,700
...and healing.

1506
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,100
It was madness.

1507
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,820
I can see that now.

1508
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,180
Madness.

1509
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,380
Madness?

1510
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,420
There is no hope.

1511
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:57,660
Leave now.

1512
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,500
Leave while you still have...

1513
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,620
...hope.

1514
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,620
The final speech he gives is sad, amazing,

1515
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,660
and deeply humanizing for such a monstrous character.

1516
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,460
Video game characters rarely have good voice actors,

1517
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,220
and the master has, too,

1518
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,380
playing about four different voices.

1519
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,660
Jim Cummings and Kath Soucie both make great performances

1520
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:35,260
that contribute to one of the best moments in video game character history.

1521
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,220
After that, all that's left is to fight your way through another

1522
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,180
and hopefully, you'll be able to get to the end of the story.

1523
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:46,380
After that, all that's left is to fight your way through an army of his men

1524
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,940
and escape the base before the GAME CRASHES!

1525
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,860
I mean before the base explodes.

1526
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:55,740
Outwitting the master feels like you've genuinely contended with an apocalyptic ideology

1527
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,300
and beaten it with intelligence and reason,

1528
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:02,300
not simply the strength of your gun or some cookie-cutter heroic speech.

1529
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,780
By the way, the male voices of the master are by the same man who voices Winnie the Pooh.

1530
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,300
I just thought I'd let you know that.

1531
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,540
Fallout 2 does a lot to...

1532
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,900
Fallout 2 does a lot as well.

1533
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:16,060
Frank Horrigan has a similar culmination of that game's themes,

1534
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,860
but if I talk about it now, I'll be here for another hour,

1535
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,780
so I'm just gonna skip ahead, okay?

1536
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,060
It's good. It's good.

1537
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,380
Play Fallout 2. Play it. Please.

1538
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,580
The part where you have a short talk to the man in the room

1539
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,660
who embodies all the problems you've faced

1540
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,860
is the best part of those two Fallout games by far to me.

1541
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,940
They tie everything together.

1542
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,100
Fallout 3 pits you against Colonel Autumn.

1543
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,780
You again.

1544
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,460
Autumn has been a dick to you personally,

1545
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:50,140
but he doesn't represent any major flaw in the world of Fallout 3.

1546
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,620
He isn't the culmination of the problems you've seen.

1547
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,020
He just sort of turns up halfway through.

1548
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,940
He's just a guy standing there saying,

1549
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,020
well, I guess it's time for us to fight now.

1550
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,820
And in the space of three lines of conversation,

1551
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,860
if you pass a speech check, you can talk him out of fighting,

1552
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,140
you can talk him out of fighting,

1553
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,980
and he just fucking walks out.

1554
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,380
Colonel Autumn doesn't really stand for anything.

1555
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,420
He doesn't want anything.

1556
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:14,380
He doesn't represent any core concept you've had to face

1557
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,420
over the course of the game.

1558
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,340
He's a wet fart on the face of Fallout storytelling.

1559
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,660
He's a piss in the mouth of philosophy.

1560
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,380
He's a sledgehammer to the balls of the inner child

1561
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,580
of the mind of thought.

1562
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,540
This character has broken my brain!

1563
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,460
The ending, this final room,

1564
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,140
could have made everything about the game come together and make sense.

1565
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,700
It would be difficult, but it could have happened,

1566
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,860
and at least put a nice bow on things.

1567
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,140
But instead, it's exactly the ending you would fucking expect

1568
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,660
from the rest of Fallout 3,

1569
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:48,460
and yet that somehow still feels disappointing.

1570
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,740
Worse than that, this game had two chances to get this right.

1571
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:53,340
There were two men in rooms.

1572
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,220
When you meet President Eden, you're in a similar scenario.

1573
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,540
Eden wants to convince you to enact his genocide,

1574
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,020
but unlike with the Master or the Lieutenant or anyone,

1575
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,660
there's no explanation, no underlying motive.

1576
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:04,380
It's just,

1577
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,580
I am bad guy.

1578
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,140
We need to kill mutants. Genocide good.

1579
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:11,660
Super mutants and ghouls must be purged.

1580
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:15,420
We need to clear the way for humanity to rebuild the wastes.

1581
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,980
The Master had a comprehensive explanation

1582
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:21,340
for why the human race needed to be converted into mutants now.

1583
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:24,380
Bethesda can't come up with a single compelling explanation

1584
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,300
for why this is actually a good idea

1585
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,660
beyond the platitude of,

1586
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,180
we need to undo mutants.

1587
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,780
Do you get it? I'm a racist.

1588
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,260
There's no philosophical struggle.

1589
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,980
It's impossible to even attempt to reason out

1590
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:39,020
why this philosophy is right or wrong in a rational manner

1591
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,460
because it's so fucking stupid that it defies rationality.

1592
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,580
You can't show him that the mutants aren't the real problem,

1593
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,700
that the real problem is something even the Enclave are a part of,

1594
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:53,580
the all-too-human need to continue to make unending war and death.

1595
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,100
How do you talk him down, then?

1596
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,980
Well, you get a please-kill-yourself speech option,

1597
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,820
and then you say, uh, you know,

1598
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,500
don't be bad. It's bad.

1599
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,420
Aren't you tired of being bad?

1600
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,260
And then he says, okay.

1601
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,340
Yes, I suppose it is.

1602
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:08,940
Very well.

1603
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,260
I'll put an end to the Enclave.

1604
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:12,780
And he does.

1605
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,140
This should be a joke,

1606
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,660
like, wow, President Eden was poorly fucking programmed,

1607
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,180
or the Enclave are fucking idiots all the way up to the top.

1608
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,900
But because there's no real discussion or struggle

1609
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:36,460
or philosophical point to be made by any of the factions or characters in this game,

1610
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:41,260
it becomes strikingly clear that this really was the best Bethesda could do,

1611
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,940
and that's just sad.

1612
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,900
Speaking of stupid, one-dimensional choices,

1613
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,700
after dealing with Autumn, you get one more moral choice.

1614
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,500
Someone has to save the Purifier,

1615
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,620
but they will die trying in the radioactive chamber.

1616
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,020
This choice fundamentally decides your ending.

1617
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,780
If you do it, you're a hero.

1618
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,740
If you let the real main character, who's been making the real choices,

1619
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,500
leading the charge, making the speeches,

1620
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,580
and literally has been putting her life on the line the entire time to do it,

1621
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,780
you're a coward.

1622
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,620
You can be good or bad.

1623
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,820
It's exactly the moral choice Fallout 3 would give you.

1624
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:16,060
That's it. No nuance, no chance to argue,

1625
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,980
hey, maybe these heroic people who love helping people and being nice could do it.

1626
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,220
If you pick Lyons, regardless of your reasoning,

1627
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,380
you're basically objectively a coward.

1628
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,260
And then it's over.

1629
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,860
You get your fucking slideshow,

1630
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,620
and war never changes,

1631
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,500
and goodbye.

1632
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,500
Which one of you did this?

1633
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,460
Which one?!

1634
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,060
Wait a second, I brought Forks with me.

1635
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,420
He's immune to radiation.

1636
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,540
In fact, earlier in the game, he did that.

1637
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:41,100
Why doesn't he just save the world and let us all live?

1638
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,460
No.

1639
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,780
Oh, well, that's just fucking great!

1640
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:50,220
The developers created an ending choice so stupid within their own fiction

1641
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:54,220
that all of a sudden, the fucking hyper-intelligent mutant

1642
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,580
has to develop a sense of destiny to fear denying you.

1643
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:01,340
They wanted to pick the most generic hero-coward choice possible,

1644
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,260
and to do it, they deliberately had to make sure

1645
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:07,500
the far better option wasn't available for no reason!

1646
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,420
Do you want to do this stupid thing,

1647
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,820
or this stupid but evil thing?

1648
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,260
What about this clear third option that's actually better than either?

1649
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:15,900
No.

1650
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:20,700
If you are writing an open-ended RPG about choice and morality,

1651
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,740
and there is a clear option the player could decide to take,

1652
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:27,260
and you put the option there, and you tell them no,

1653
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,140
you fucked up!

1654
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,380
But you didn't just fuck up the ending,

1655
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,020
because the sort of idiots who would make this decision

1656
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,780
made the rest of the game too.

1657
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:38,140
Those same shit-stained fingerprints are all over it.

1658
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,100
Pick a cartoon character, or kill them both.

1659
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,820
Nuke a town for no reason, or don't.

1660
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,220
Ask Tenpenny Tower not to be racist,

1661
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:49,260
or fucking murder a bunch of innocent girls for no reason.

1662
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,180
I don't even know what Autumn wanted.

1663
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,660
He was against Eden's genocide plan.

1664
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,500
Seemingly all Autumn wanted

1665
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,620
was for the Purity Project to have an Enclave sticker on it.

1666
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,500
When it isn't clear what the final boss's plan is,

1667
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,500
it's time to do a rewrite.

1668
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,340
No, wait! I didn't mean that!

1669
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,060
No!

1670
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:06,560
No—

1671
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,460
Do you get it? It's a reference to the name of the final—

1672
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,340
Ah, whatever.

1673
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,020
We all knew I was going to cover this.

1674
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,540
Everyone hated the ending.

1675
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,460
People hated Bethesda so much,

1676
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,700
they wanted to shit themselves inside out.

1677
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,540
They were made of piss.

1678
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,300
There isn't enough hyperbole to explain

1679
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,180
how mad people were with the stupid ending.

1680
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,820
Then Bethesda released the Broken Steel DLC.

1681
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,220
So now you survive your heroic sacrifice.

1682
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,860
While being able to carry on is arguably a straightforward improvement,

1683
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,100
it speaks volumes that the developers either

1684
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:39,820
A.

1685
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,580
didn't think of that in the first place

1686
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,460
in the years it took making and playtesting the game,

1687
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,100
during which they claimed to have played the originals.

1688
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:47,900
Hmm.

1689
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,140
Maybe we should make a version of Fallout 2

1690
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,500
that's missing a key feature

1691
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,540
and hope the player has a save before the ending started.

1692
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,060
Great idea, Todd!

1693
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,180
And while you're at it,

1694
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,220
let's add more companions who are immune to radiation

1695
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,460
but refuse to fix the purifier.

1696
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,540
By the way, Todd, you don't sound so good.

1697
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,260
Are you okay?

1698
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:06,540
Or B.

1699
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,900
They really believed in the finality of their project

1700
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,100
in giving the Lone Wanderer a semblance of a complete arc

1701
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,620
going from birth to death,

1702
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,900
then walked back on it the instant people complained.

1703
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,500
Or C.

1704
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,980
Did this deliberately so players would buy the DLC

1705
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,900
unless some carry on playing their game.

1706
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,020
You'll notice there's no footage from Broken Steel in this video.

1707
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,900
That's because, back when it came out,

1708
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,500
I found myself wondering

1709
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,860
why I would pay to play more of Fallout 3.

1710
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,740
I had already accidentally slipped and hit the button

1711
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,500
that buys Operation Anchorage,

1712
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,540
a ten-quid-costing corridor full of generic enemies

1713
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,740
you can't talk to,

1714
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:45,420
terminating in a general who gives up

1715
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,020
if you say one thing to him.

1716
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,580
In other words, a microcosm of the actual game.

1717
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,140
Players had to fix the beginning,

1718
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,140
the developers had to fix the end,

1719
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:57,020
and that leaves only a middle consisting of hollow nonsense

1720
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,180
where you shoot the bad guys until they die

1721
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,820
and collect Fallout-themed MacGuffins.

1722
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,220
It's no surprise that players who have the most fun

1723
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,020
are the ones who traipse around on their own kind of adventure,

1724
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,540
shunning the garbage experience poorly planned for their perusal,

1725
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,860
flicking on the radio, and just doing whatever they like.

1726
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,780
A friend who is way smarter than me

1727
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:17,100
has played Fallout 3 for a very long time,

1728
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,140
and still does,

1729
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,220
because they essentially just walk around,

1730
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,980
taking very little interest in the experience

1731
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,340
the world had planned for them.

1732
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,020
The best way to have fun with the game

1733
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:28,460
is to view the whole thing as something to take a walking tour through,

1734
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,380
purposefully carving out your own journey

1735
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,220
almost in spite of the game itself.

1736
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:33,980
These people aren't playing the game wrong

1737
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,820
for not focusing on the story.

1738
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,660
They're proving how wrong the game is

1739
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,220
by showing how differently the game has to be approached

1740
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,660
in order to be enjoyed.

1741
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,540
It is a story-driven action RPG

1742
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,980
in which, to have fun,

1743
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,780
you have to avoid the story on purpose.

1744
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,580
For a long time, like, years,

1745
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,500
I was pretty sure Fallout 3 wasn't just bad,

1746
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,180
but it was proof you couldn't make a nuanced 3D game of its scale

1747
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,540
without it being bad.

1748
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,540
There wasn't enough time to make it good.

1749
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,020
There was too much manpower involved.

1750
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,060
I thought that maybe the future was dark for RPGs.

1751
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,580
When New Vegas came out,

1752
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,500
I didn't play it for about two years.

1753
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,780
I'd been burned before.

1754
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,460
But then one day in university,

1755
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:18,460
I did.

1756
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,100
Fallout New Vegas is the fourth game on that list.

1757
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,740
It fixed everything.

1758
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:42,220
The opening isn't seven million hours long

1759
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,460
populated with unavoidable murder.

1760
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,140
You walk over to a machine,

1761
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,180
pick your stats,

1762
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,780
sit a short personality test,

1763
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,140
and you go on an adventure.

1764
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,380
Traits are back.

1765
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,300
The mutants in Brotherhood and Enclave

1766
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,140
are treated differently from their appearances

1767
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,660
in 1, 2, and 3,

1768
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,900
and their changes are explained and justified

1769
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,100
and understandable

1770
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,180
while not distracting from the main story,

1771
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,460
which concerns the threat posed by an entirely new faction

1772
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:09,500
because the creators knew how to come up with new ideas.

1773
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,500
And the new faction is a group of seemingly unjustifiably genocidal fascists,

1774
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,260
but when you sit down with their leader,

1775
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,340
he gives a meaningful and legitimate criticism of democracy itself

1776
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,060
and starts talking about the Hegelian dialectic.

1777
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,220
When that happened the first time I played,

1778
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:29,260
I cried the only two tears I have ever wept playing a video game.

1779
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,820
I am not embarrassed to admit that even a little.

1780
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,620
Conversations are fixed.

1781
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,980
Not only are speech checks no longer just a fucking dice roll,

1782
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,980
you can use skills besides speech,

1783
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,260
especially barter,

1784
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,220
to get an edge,

1785
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,660
but if you don't have enough,

1786
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,420
you get a joke option that automatically fails just for fun.

1787
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,660
You can repair weapons using other stuff,

1788
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:52,300
making the laser pistol you find in the first room of the game

1789
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,460
an immediately useful option.

1790
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,340
That's right!

1791
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,460
The weapons work in Fallout New Vegas!

1792
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,060
The game's writing and acting is so nuanced,

1793
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:05,900
you can tell what a character's stance is on Caesar's Legion

1794
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:09,180
based on how they pronounce the name Caesar.

1795
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,500
The world's design is paste,

1796
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,900
so the game actually gets harder as you go,

1797
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:18,220
and you actually need all the crazy explosives you pick up on the way.

1798
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,620
The only problems I can identify are

1799
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:23,020
the game crashes when you try to resurrect yourself,

1800
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,780
which seems ironic given how the game starts with you doing that,

1801
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:30,060
and that I can't seem to uninstall the giant bouncy breast mod

1802
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:33,100
a friend installed on my computer at a party years ago,

1803
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:36,380
despite making fresh installs on several computers.

1804
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,740
That is a true story.

1805
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,700
It is a true story, and I have healthy beliefs about women,

1806
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,740
and...

1807
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,180
Just cut this part out, really.

1808
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,220
We...

1809
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,420
They're not gonna believe me.

1810
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,380
Fallout New Vegas, for me, is...

1811
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,020
the best game.

1812
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:53,260
But for me, it's somehow even more than that.

1813
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,300
It proved that you could tell a good story and make an amazing world

1814
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:00,140
just by actually bothering to design and write and paste it properly.

1815
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:04,060
It fixed everything wrong with Fallout 3.

1816
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,580
Literally everything.

1817
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,740
I can't even go into detail about all the ways that it improves upon its predecessor,

1818
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,380
because we're already an hour and twenty minutes in.

1819
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,900
What else can I even say?

1820
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,780
I just...

1821
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:18,060
There isn't enough time left, and we're gonna eventually have to stop.

1822
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,780
Just trust me, and give it a shot for yourself.

1823
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:22,940
If, for some reason, you haven't played New Vegas,

1824
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:27,580
perhaps because you were burned out after playing hours and hours and hours of Fallout 3,

1825
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,060
maybe now is a good time to give it a shot.

1826
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,700
Although Fallout 4 just came out, so I bet everyone's burned on that, too.

1827
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,220
Ugh, whatever.

1828
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,740
They also seem to have seen the same problems with 3 that I have,

1829
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:41,980
at least based on their attitude to it and its fans in the making of documentary.

1830
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,580
A lot of people like Fallout 3.

1831
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,540
That little smirk.

1832
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,300
That's just such a beautiful moment.

1833
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,340
I'm gonna be honest.

1834
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:51,020
The reason why I decided to play New Vegas was because I saw him do that.

1835
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,140
I saw that smirk.

1836
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,460
I thought, yeah, he knows.

1837
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,060
Th- He knows!

1838
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:00,060
Josh Sawyer is what would happen if you dipped Todd Howard in the vats.

1839
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,620
He's- he's just- he's just better!

1840
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:08,780
I would do a lot of dark shit to try and get a Fallout 4 New Vegas-type situation happening,

1841
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:13,260
but, to be honest, I kind of like the idea of Obsidian doing their own thing.

1842
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:17,500
Almost one of the core messages of New Vegas and what it does with the Fallout mythos is

1843
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,300
show you that it's okay to do things differently,

1844
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:24,620
and in a way, it's truer to the spirit of that by letting them just make their own thing,

1845
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:26,460
not even having a Fallout name on it.

1846
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:32,220
In a way, Black Isle getting shot in the head and Obsidian rising from their grave

1847
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,660
made them truly free to do whatever they want without being attached to any pre-existing property.

1848
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,620
Meanwhile, Bethesda's become this franchise zombie,

1849
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:43,740
just making more Fallouts and more Elder Scrolls,

1850
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:46,940
and- and they published the new Doom and Wolfenstein as well.

1851
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:50,620
If you asked me which developers are going to come up with the better, fresher,

1852
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,460
more interesting and unique ideas,

1853
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,740
well, you don't need to ask me, it's fucking obvious!

1854
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:12,140
You can say what you like, but this, for me, is the defining moment of Fallout 3.

1855
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:16,220
It's the most telling portion about the priorities in the game's development,

1856
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:19,820
and the most straightforward expression of all its problems and mistakes,

1857
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,820
and it's about ten seconds of gameplay.

1858
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,340
You walk into the final chamber with the water purifier.

1859
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,100
Autumn's here.

1860
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:30,780
He plans to kill you with his gun because he wants to, uh,

1861
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:35,500
be the guy who has the water purifier that's gonna exist anyway

1862
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,980
and purify all the water regardless of anything.

1863
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:41,260
In the course of three sentences, you talk him down from his desire to do this.

1864
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,180
He gives up and goes to walk out.

1865
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,780
On his way, I remember this guy doesn't deserve to walk out of here.

1866
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,700
I have an obligation to stop him.

1867
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,100
I killed all his guys, I'm gonna let him go?

1868
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,220
The guy upon whom this entire conflict can be blamed?

1869
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:58,300
The guy who my dad killed himself trying to stop and yet miraculously survived?

1870
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,380
Fuck that guy!

1871
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:03,740
I'm gonna shoot him in the face with a butter knife I stole from his own base!

1872
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,700
Look at this frame for a moment.

1873
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:15,820
The creators of this game modelled the individual 3D pieces of a face exploding.

1874
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,980
The eyes, the brain, the skull,

1875
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:22,940
the fleshy, gooey, splashy matter erupting from a gaping hole in his neck.

1876
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:29,340
This is a complex rendition of a head actually being crushed apart into disparate shapes

1877
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,100
and leaving behind a gory hole.

1878
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:34,940
They probably had to look up diagrams and do research for this,

1879
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,180
model every individual piece,

1880
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,980
and make sure it spawned correctly where the head once was.

1881
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:45,180
They wanted to make sure that when you shot someone in the face with a gun,

1882
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:50,700
it exploded in the perfect blend of satisfying, hilarious, and grimly visceral.

1883
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,740
The character stands for nothing.

1884
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,100
He turns on a dime.

1885
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:55,980
He's flat.

1886
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,380
He's not written well in any of his appearances.

1887
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,660
They didn't write a character who you could have a real conversation with.

1888
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:02,620
You either say,

1889
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,340
Time to die, or give up and walk out now, please.

1890
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:09,580
The creator's time was apparently better spent on something else.

1891
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:14,380
Planet Xbox 360 gave Fallout 3 a 9.8,

1892
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:15,100
saying,

1893
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,700
Presentation.

1894
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,860
That site now redirects to a clickbait site,

1895
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:31,660
because it turns out game reviewers really did at some point get purged the way I said they should earlier.

1896
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,580
Archive.org saved the site.

1897
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,860
The review is mostly fluff talking about how many enemies there are to kill,

1898
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,620
how pretty the blood explosions are,

1899
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,820
and how cool VATS is,

1900
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,660
and how much it reminded them of Oblivion.

1901
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,340
The images are missing from the archive,

1902
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,020
but it's no big loss.

1903
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,980
I've seen enough pictures and video from enough other reviews

1904
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:51,900
to know there'd probably be more shots from VATS of the player shooting someone else.

1905
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,580
AKA, slight variations on this frame.

1906
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,700
The developers spent their time on the presentation.

1907
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,060
On this.

1908
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,220
Not on the writing.

1909
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:05,820
Not on making you care whose face it was, and why it's exploding.

1910
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,300
But it doesn't matter now.

1911
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:14,940
This un-nuanced, barely even written, confusing-motived man is very definitely dead.

1912
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,500
But Lyons doesn't think so.

1913
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,540
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you just let him walk away.

1914
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:21,900
Lyons, you—

1915
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,060
You are not good at this.

1916
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,540
Go into the water now, please.

1917
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:27,100
Just go.

1918
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:27,740
Just go—

1919
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:28,780
OH GOD!

1920
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,740
OH GOD!

1921
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:46,940
I'd also like to thank Jenny Angel, CavP, Kevin M. Knippy, MK, Malick Malachi-Robinson,

1922
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:52,140
Max Scher, Rob Brunt, Simon AJ, and Tom Cameron.

1923
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:54,060
I'd also like to apologize.

1924
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,300
I split the people I was thanking per video in half

1925
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,260
because I thought I was going to get the other half thanked in this video,

1926
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,740
and then I went way over the end of the month.

1927
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,340
Everyone who backed me last month,

1928
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,020
and everyone who backed me this month,

1929
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:06,940
went way over the end of the month.

1930
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,740
Everyone who backed me last month will get thanked this month

1931
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,540
in the two videos coming up soon.

1932
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,220
This one just took a lot longer than I thought,

1933
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,420
and I had to help with the funeral.

1934
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,860
It was a whole thing.

1935
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:17,820
Next time I do one of these,

1936
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,540
I kind of want to talk about the philosophy of Dark Souls 2,

1937
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:25,980
or why Bloodborne is the best-designed Souls game in terms of introducing it to new players.

1938
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,620
Click on—

1939
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,660
No, I don't have to do those.

1940
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,900
Just let me know in the comments which you'd prefer.

1941
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:31,900
Or, you know, suggest a new thing.

1942
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:32,860
I don't mind.

1943
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,380
You know, I'm out of ideas.
