00:06.280 --> 00:10.160
Greetings, fellow Antifa super-soldiers.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.220
It's me, Harris Bomberguy, official spokesman for the radical left.

00:15.220 --> 00:21.320
Well, I'm right up there, behind, uh, Mark Hamill and a catgirl.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.800
I'm here to bring you an important announcement regarding the official leftist diet plan,

00:25.800 --> 00:28.240
which, as you know, we have.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.880
The original smash-the-state diet plan recommends numerous soy products,

00:32.880 --> 00:38.600
but thanks to the work of rigorous journalist and intellectual powerhouse Paul Joseph Watson,

00:38.600 --> 00:42.200
it turns out that soy might be bad for you?

00:42.200 --> 00:45.240
That's huge, if it turns out to be true!

00:45.240 --> 00:51.640
Is soy food consumption turning men into pussies and making them more likely to adopt left-wing beliefs?

00:51.640 --> 00:54.480
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.560
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.000
There seems to be an even closer correlation between male feminist virtue-signalers,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.400
who defend Muslim refugees, and their soy fetish.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.240
What is it about soy that turns men into such spineless wimps?

01:10.240 --> 01:16.520
A full investigation at Antifa headquarters, which exists,

01:16.520 --> 01:21.240
is underway to determine if the soy diet is a product of fascist subversion.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.280
Please refrain from consuming soy products until further notice.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.000
Nailed it.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.960
And thanks to further investigation by Paul Joseph Watson's enlightened fanbase,

01:30.960 --> 01:33.760
you might also want to hold off on drinking...

01:33.760 --> 01:34.760
water.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.560
In the meantime, we'd better watch more of Paul's content to find out what foods he recommends in its place.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.560
Roll the clip, Jeremy!

01:45.560 --> 01:48.200
Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video,

01:48.200 --> 01:52.800
I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.320
This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.

The all-new, supercharged Brain Force Plus, because there's a war on for your mind.

02:11.760 --> 02:16.600
Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons

02:16.600 --> 02:21.240
in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
AAAAAAAH!

02:23.920 --> 02:27.680
Ah, well, we can't find any top scientists or researchers who say this,

02:27.680 --> 02:32.240
and Labdor in San Francisco has tested the supplements and found their effects to be massively lacking

02:32.240 --> 02:36.200
and also to be hugely overpriced compared to the same pills sold elsewhere.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.240
Almost as if InfoWars is a giant scam for money.

02:39.240 --> 02:45.440
But that's what you would get if you trusted the soy-entists at Soy-Fran-Soy-Sco.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.920
Let's turn instead to the unbiased internet for a second opinion.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.000
I bought this stuff because Alex told me this would help me turn the corner mentally,

02:54.000 --> 02:55.360
but it hasn't really worked.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.440
I just get all jittery, I can't sit still, and then I pass out without accomplishing anything.

02:59.440 --> 03:04.600
The real conspiracy is Jones' garbage products that he sells to ignorant people that believe his lies.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.680
I used to be one of them, but not after my horrible experience with Brain Force.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.880
When I took Brain Force, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, and then the diarrhea started.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.480
I tried to return the product, but they were rude and ignored me.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.160
By all of these accounts, Brain Force fails to establish itself as a quality nootropic supplement.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.560
They cut their one useful ingredient with cheap stimulants and sedatives

03:24.560 --> 03:26.760
that are neither considered healthy nor effective.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.600
Alex Jones and InfoWars both have an extremely negative reputation

03:30.600 --> 03:33.680
within the scientific, medical, and business worlds,

03:33.680 --> 03:36.800
and their products are considered low quality in general.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.600
Pfft.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.200
Lastly, the vast majority of their previous users have negative things to say

03:41.200 --> 03:43.080
about their experiences with the product.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.520
There is no better judge of how effective a supplement can be

03:45.520 --> 03:47.440
than the results it gets from normal people,

03:47.440 --> 03:50.680
and they largely have not had positive things to say about its effects.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.560
How does Brain Force compare to similar nootropics?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.240
Well, um...

03:56.400 --> 03:57.240
Uh...

03:57.240 --> 04:01.640
But of course, there's no reason to trust Richard at dietsinreview.com.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.160
After all, for all we know, he could be using, uh...

04:05.160 --> 04:08.560
science to determine the effects of these supplements.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.200
And science is known to be a tool of the establishment,

04:11.200 --> 04:14.680
run purely by leftists and water drinkers,

04:14.680 --> 04:15.840
or as I like to call them,

04:15.840 --> 04:17.520
fluoride fops.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.880
It's alliterative so that my less intelligent fans

04:19.880 --> 04:22.520
will remember what I'm talking about when the video's ended.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.360
So I wouldn't trust that website either.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.440
No, all we need to do to find out what we're putting into our bodies

04:27.440 --> 04:29.360
is to look at the ingredients section.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.640
So, using our heads, we can determine that instead of soy,

04:33.640 --> 04:36.120
we're just getting pure, unadulterated...

It's additive-free, nothing artificial.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.640
It's Brain Force Plus.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.520
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.640
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.880
Men with low testosterone have impaired sexual functioning.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.160
They lose their libido.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.760

05:03.760 --> 05:06.160
I take two capsules of Brain Force.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.200
Men with high estrogen take on feminine traits.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.120
They find it harder to handle stress.

What is it about soy that turns men into such spineless wimps?

We're losing an entire generation of young men...

05:23.880 --> 05:24.600

05:36.920 --> 05:39.720
When it comes to soy, just say no.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.680
Okay, okay, this might be a little confusing for some people.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.240
If soy makes you effeminate and a leftist,

05:45.240 --> 05:49.840
why is Paul, a right-wing Adonis-like perfect specimen of human masculinity,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.400
happily recommending products that contain soy?

05:52.400 --> 05:56.880
How do we resolve the deadlock between what Paul says and what Paul does?

05:56.880 --> 06:00.520
Obviously, my first solution was to drink some raw milk to own the libs

06:00.520 --> 06:02.840
and then have to have a light down for a little bit.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.880
But when I got out of the hospital, I realized that the main problem

06:05.880 --> 06:07.800
is that Paul simply doesn't have enough data

06:07.800 --> 06:10.240
to determine whether or not soy is bad for him,

06:10.240 --> 06:13.840
which is a problem that tends to come with ignoring all the data.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.320
So we're going to have to test the effects of soy ourselves

06:16.320 --> 06:21.480
without those pesky scientists surreptitiously inserting their misleading FACTS.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.360
And as a fan of Paul's, um, journalism,

06:25.360 --> 06:27.720
I volunteer my body to be the test.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.840
The normal H-Bomber Guy diet, the HBG Classic,

06:30.840 --> 06:33.920
consists mostly of coffee with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk,

06:33.920 --> 06:36.520
porridge consumed on the toilet for maximum efficiency,

06:37.520 --> 06:39.560
co-op chicken and bacon wraps,

06:39.560 --> 06:41.560
co-op duck and hoisin sauce wraps,

06:41.560 --> 06:43.000
McDonald's chicken nuggets,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.880
the worst energy drinks I can find,

06:44.880 --> 06:46.840
sausage and chips with cheese and curry sauce

06:46.840 --> 06:48.840
from a shop where everyone recognizes me from high school

06:48.840 --> 06:51.160
and at some point also found out about my YouTube channel

06:51.160 --> 06:52.440
and it's really embarrassing!

06:52.440 --> 06:55.360
This isn't a joke! Shout out to Dan and Cullen if you're watching this!

06:55.360 --> 06:58.320
And for dessert, co-op Easy Roll Puff pastry.

06:58.320 --> 07:03.080
I'm not fully certain I consume that much soy at all.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.840
So let's change that.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.880
My pal Alexis Berman on Twitter drew up a soy boy diet

07:07.880 --> 07:10.960
which includes plenty of great examples of things containing soy

07:10.960 --> 07:13.280
and I'll be largely sticking to it for the next 30 days

07:13.280 --> 07:14.480
and recording my weight,

07:14.480 --> 07:16.400
taking intrusive pictures of my body

07:16.400 --> 07:18.560
and seeing if I become a puny effeminate weakling

07:18.560 --> 07:20.920
right in time for my really buff and health-conscious cousin

07:20.920 --> 07:22.320
to make fun of me at Christmas dinner

07:22.320 --> 07:23.960
for the third year in a fucking row.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.600
I just got back from Holland and Barrett,

07:25.600 --> 07:28.120
a store I've never walked into before in my life.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.080
My basic rule for this diet is that anything I can reasonably replace

07:31.080 --> 07:32.880
with a soy-based product will be.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.840
Soy yogurt, soy milk, soy replacements for meat and so on.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.200
This will probably effectively double as a vegan diet

07:38.200 --> 07:40.600
because all meats and animal products I would normally be eating

07:40.600 --> 07:43.400
are being replaced for the purposes of ensuring I'm eating enough soy

07:43.400 --> 07:44.560
for this test to be efficient.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.160
Basically, the only soy product I won't be consuming

07:47.160 --> 07:49.080
is Brain Force Plus because holy shit,

07:49.080 --> 07:51.000
have you seen the reviews? It's fucking terrible!

07:51.000 --> 07:54.360
See you in around 30 days when I cover the effects of this ridiculous test

07:54.360 --> 07:56.120
and also do a more in-depth debunking

07:56.120 --> 07:58.240
of the bizarre conspiracy theorist ideology

07:58.240 --> 07:59.960
behind nonsense like Paul's video.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.640
I've already done my initial weigh-in.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.400
I've censored it, though, because after filming this,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.240
I realized I was holding a pretty heavy camera

08:05.240 --> 08:06.960
that would severely affect the results.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.280
So I'm gonna have to weigh myself again later.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.040
You know what they say about the camera adding 10 pounds?

08:13.680 --> 08:15.560
It was significantly more than 10 pounds.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.800
I'll be documenting everything I eat over on Patreon

08:17.800 --> 08:20.960
for people who are super interested in the things I'm putting into my mouth

08:20.960 --> 08:22.760
and maybe I'll record some little bonus videos

08:22.760 --> 08:25.240
about the experience of eating vegan meat replacement foods

08:25.240 --> 08:26.480
for the first time in my life.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.960
And as a send-off for meat in my diet for at least the next 30 days,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.520
I got myself my favorite meat-based product.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.640
Thanks for watching, and until next time,

08:38.640 --> 08:39.680
avoid eating...

08:42.000 --> 08:45.840
I'm trying to think of a comical food to avoid eating

08:45.840 --> 08:47.840
in case it turns you into a leftist,

08:47.840 --> 08:51.840
but these people are literally afraid of beans and water.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.400
So I can't think of anything funnier than that.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.600
You can't own them any harder than they're owning themselves.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.040
So I guess I'll soy you in a month.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.600
These are actually quite hard to peel.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.120
Would be really cool if I peeled it right as I said that, wouldn't it?

09:08.120 --> 09:11.920
I guess I'll soy you in a month.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.800
Great.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.560
You know, the basic amount of nutritional research I did

09:18.560 --> 09:22.080
to form the basis of the diet I'm gonna be doing

09:22.080 --> 09:23.880
has led me to realize

09:23.880 --> 09:26.960
that I actually don't want to eat any more of these.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.640
So I can't even do the ending I'd planned.
