6280	10160	Greetings, fellow Antifa super-soldiers.
10160	15220	It's me, Harris Bomberguy, official spokesman for the radical left.
15220	21320	Well, I'm right up there, behind, uh, Mark Hamill and a catgirl.
21320	25800	I'm here to bring you an important announcement regarding the official leftist diet plan,
25800	28240	which, as you know, we have.
28240	32880	The original smash-the-state diet plan recommends numerous soy products,
32880	38600	but thanks to the work of rigorous journalist and intellectual powerhouse Paul Joseph Watson,
38600	42200	it turns out that soy might be bad for you?
42200	45240	That's huge, if it turns out to be true!
45240	51640	Is soy food consumption turning men into pussies and making them more likely to adopt left-wing beliefs?
51640	54480	Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens.
54480	57560	This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.
57560	63000	There seems to be an even closer correlation between male feminist virtue-signalers,
63000	66400	who defend Muslim refugees, and their soy fetish.
66400	70240	What is it about soy that turns men into such spineless wimps?
70240	76520	A full investigation at Antifa headquarters, which exists,
76520	81240	is underway to determine if the soy diet is a product of fascist subversion.
81240	86280	Please refrain from consuming soy products until further notice.
86280	87000	Nailed it.
87000	90960	And thanks to further investigation by Paul Joseph Watson's enlightened fanbase,
90960	93760	you might also want to hold off on drinking...
93760	94760	water.
98640	103560	In the meantime, we'd better watch more of Paul's content to find out what foods he recommends in its place.
103560	105560	Roll the clip, Jeremy!
105560	108200	Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video,
108200	112800	I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
112800	117320	This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
117320	121440	These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
121440	125680	Get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
125680	131760	The all-new, supercharged Brain Force Plus, because there's a war on for your mind.
131760	136600	Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons
136600	141240	in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
141280	142280	AAAAAAAH!
143920	147680	Ah, well, we can't find any top scientists or researchers who say this,
147680	152240	and Labdor in San Francisco has tested the supplements and found their effects to be massively lacking
152240	156200	and also to be hugely overpriced compared to the same pills sold elsewhere.
156200	159240	Almost as if InfoWars is a giant scam for money.
159240	165440	But that's what you would get if you trusted the soy-entists at Soy-Fran-Soy-Sco.
165440	169920	Let's turn instead to the unbiased internet for a second opinion.
169920	174000	I bought this stuff because Alex told me this would help me turn the corner mentally,
174000	175360	but it hasn't really worked.
175360	179440	I just get all jittery, I can't sit still, and then I pass out without accomplishing anything.
179440	184600	The real conspiracy is Jones' garbage products that he sells to ignorant people that believe his lies.
184600	188680	I used to be one of them, but not after my horrible experience with Brain Force.
188680	192880	When I took Brain Force, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, and then the diarrhea started.
192880	196480	I tried to return the product, but they were rude and ignored me.
196480	201160	By all of these accounts, Brain Force fails to establish itself as a quality nootropic supplement.
201160	204560	They cut their one useful ingredient with cheap stimulants and sedatives
204560	206760	that are neither considered healthy nor effective.
206760	210600	Alex Jones and InfoWars both have an extremely negative reputation
210600	213680	within the scientific, medical, and business worlds,
213680	216800	and their products are considered low quality in general.
216800	217600	Pfft.
217600	221200	Lastly, the vast majority of their previous users have negative things to say
221200	223080	about their experiences with the product.
223080	225520	There is no better judge of how effective a supplement can be
225520	227440	than the results it gets from normal people,
227440	230680	and they largely have not had positive things to say about its effects.
230680	233560	How does Brain Force compare to similar nootropics?
233560	235240	Well, um...
236400	237240	Uh...
237240	241640	But of course, there's no reason to trust Richard at dietsinreview.com.
241640	245160	After all, for all we know, he could be using, uh...
245160	248560	science to determine the effects of these supplements.
248560	251200	And science is known to be a tool of the establishment,
251200	254680	run purely by leftists and water drinkers,
254680	255840	or as I like to call them,
255840	257520	fluoride fops.
257520	259880	It's alliterative so that my less intelligent fans
259880	262520	will remember what I'm talking about when the video's ended.
262520	264360	So I wouldn't trust that website either.
264360	267440	No, all we need to do to find out what we're putting into our bodies
267440	269360	is to look at the ingredients section.
270240	273640	So, using our heads, we can determine that instead of soy,
273640	276120	we're just getting pure, unadulterated...
276120	282560	[♪ Dramatic music ♪ and singing from the video ♪
282560	285440	I think I might be getting a few mixed messages here, Paul.
285440	289080	It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
289080	290640	It's Brain Force Plus.
290640	293520	Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens.
293520	296640	This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.
296640	299880	Men with low testosterone have impaired sexual functioning.
299880	301160	They lose their libido.
301160	303760	Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video,
303760	306160	I take two capsules of Brain Force.
306160	309200	Men with high estrogen take on feminine traits.
309200	311120	They find it harder to handle stress.
311120	312360	I take Brain Force.
312360	314880	Their voices get higher, their genitals shrink.
314880	316120	I take Brain Force.
316120	319920	What is it about soy that turns men into such spineless wimps?
319920	322760	We're losing an entire generation of young men...
323880	324600	...to soy.
324600	329040	This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
329040	332680	Soy boy, soy boy, soy boy.
332680	336920	Get your Brain Force Plus at infowarslife.com.
336920	339720	When it comes to soy, just say no.
340240	342680	Okay, okay, this might be a little confusing for some people.
342680	345240	If soy makes you effeminate and a leftist,
345240	349840	why is Paul, a right-wing Adonis-like perfect specimen of human masculinity,
349840	352400	happily recommending products that contain soy?
352400	356880	How do we resolve the deadlock between what Paul says and what Paul does?
356880	360520	Obviously, my first solution was to drink some raw milk to own the libs
360520	362840	and then have to have a light down for a little bit.
362840	365880	But when I got out of the hospital, I realized that the main problem
365880	367800	is that Paul simply doesn't have enough data
367800	370240	to determine whether or not soy is bad for him,
370240	373840	which is a problem that tends to come with ignoring all the data.
373840	376320	So we're going to have to test the effects of soy ourselves
376320	381480	without those pesky scientists surreptitiously inserting their misleading FACTS.
381480	385360	And as a fan of Paul's, um, journalism,
385360	387720	I volunteer my body to be the test.
387720	390840	The normal H-Bomber Guy diet, the HBG Classic,
390840	393920	consists mostly of coffee with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk,
393920	396520	porridge consumed on the toilet for maximum efficiency,
397520	399560	co-op chicken and bacon wraps,
399560	401560	co-op duck and hoisin sauce wraps,
401560	403000	McDonald's chicken nuggets,
403000	404880	the worst energy drinks I can find,
404880	406840	sausage and chips with cheese and curry sauce
406840	408840	from a shop where everyone recognizes me from high school
408840	411160	and at some point also found out about my YouTube channel
411160	412440	and it's really embarrassing!
412440	415360	This isn't a joke! Shout out to Dan and Cullen if you're watching this!
415360	418320	And for dessert, co-op Easy Roll Puff pastry.
418320	423080	I'm not fully certain I consume that much soy at all.
423080	424840	So let's change that.
424880	427880	My pal Alexis Berman on Twitter drew up a soy boy diet
427880	430960	which includes plenty of great examples of things containing soy
430960	433280	and I'll be largely sticking to it for the next 30 days
433280	434480	and recording my weight,
434480	436400	taking intrusive pictures of my body
436400	438560	and seeing if I become a puny effeminate weakling
438560	440920	right in time for my really buff and health-conscious cousin
440920	442320	to make fun of me at Christmas dinner
442320	443960	for the third year in a fucking row.
443960	445600	I just got back from Holland and Barrett,
445600	448120	a store I've never walked into before in my life.
448120	451080	My basic rule for this diet is that anything I can reasonably replace
451080	452880	with a soy-based product will be.
452880	455840	Soy yogurt, soy milk, soy replacements for meat and so on.
455840	458200	This will probably effectively double as a vegan diet
458200	460600	because all meats and animal products I would normally be eating
460600	463400	are being replaced for the purposes of ensuring I'm eating enough soy
463400	464560	for this test to be efficient.
464560	467160	Basically, the only soy product I won't be consuming
467160	469080	is Brain Force Plus because holy shit,
469080	471000	have you seen the reviews? It's fucking terrible!
471000	474360	See you in around 30 days when I cover the effects of this ridiculous test
474360	476120	and also do a more in-depth debunking
476120	478240	of the bizarre conspiracy theorist ideology
478240	479960	behind nonsense like Paul's video.
479960	481640	I've already done my initial weigh-in.
481640	483400	I've censored it, though, because after filming this,
483400	485240	I realized I was holding a pretty heavy camera
485240	486960	that would severely affect the results.
486960	489280	So I'm gonna have to weigh myself again later.
489280	492040	You know what they say about the camera adding 10 pounds?
493680	495560	It was significantly more than 10 pounds.
495560	497800	I'll be documenting everything I eat over on Patreon
497800	500960	for people who are super interested in the things I'm putting into my mouth
500960	502760	and maybe I'll record some little bonus videos
502760	505240	about the experience of eating vegan meat replacement foods
505240	506480	for the first time in my life.
506480	509960	And as a send-off for meat in my diet for at least the next 30 days,
510000	513520	I got myself my favorite meat-based product.
516440	518640	Thanks for watching, and until next time,
518640	519680	avoid eating...
522000	525840	I'm trying to think of a comical food to avoid eating
525840	527840	in case it turns you into a leftist,
527840	531840	but these people are literally afraid of beans and water.
531840	534400	So I can't think of anything funnier than that.
534400	537600	You can't own them any harder than they're owning themselves.
537600	541040	So I guess I'll soy you in a month.
542560	544600	These are actually quite hard to peel.
545600	548120	Would be really cool if I peeled it right as I said that, wouldn't it?
548120	551920	I guess I'll soy you in a month.
553800	554800	Great.
556000	558560	You know, the basic amount of nutritional research I did
558560	562080	to form the basis of the diet I'm gonna be doing
562080	563880	has led me to realize
563880	566960	that I actually don't want to eat any more of these.
566960	568640	So I can't even do the ending I'd planned.
