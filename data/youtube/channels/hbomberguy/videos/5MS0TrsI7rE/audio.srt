Greetings, fellow Antifa super-soldiers.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,220
It's me, Harris Bomberguy, official spokesman for the radical left.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,320
Well, I'm right up there, behind, uh, Mark Hamill and a catgirl.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm here to bring you an important announcement regarding the official leftist diet plan,

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,240
which, as you know, we have.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,880
The original smash-the-state diet plan recommends numerous soy products,

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,600
but thanks to the work of rigorous journalist and intellectual powerhouse Paul Joseph Watson,

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
it turns out that soy might be bad for you?

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,240
That's huge, if it turns out to be true!

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,640
Is soy food consumption turning men into pussies and making them more likely to adopt left-wing beliefs?

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,480
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,560
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,000
There seems to be an even closer correlation between male feminist virtue-signalers,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,400
who defend Muslim refugees, and their soy fetish.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
What is it about soy that turns men into such spineless wimps?

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,520
A full investigation at Antifa headquarters, which exists,

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,240
is underway to determine if the soy diet is a product of fascist subversion.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,280
Please refrain from consuming soy products until further notice.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,000

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,960

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,760
you might also want to hold off on drinking...

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
water.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,560
In the meantime, we'd better watch more of Paul's content to find out what foods he recommends in its place.

The all-new, supercharged Brain Force Plus, because there's a war on for your mind.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,600
Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,240
in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
AAAAAAAH!

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,680
Ah, well, we can't find any top scientists or researchers who say this,

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,240
and Labdor in San Francisco has tested the supplements and found their effects to be massively lacking

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,200
and also to be hugely overpriced compared to the same pills sold elsewhere.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,240
Almost as if InfoWars is a giant scam for money.

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,440
But that's what you would get if you trusted the soy-entists at Soy-Fran-Soy-Sco.

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's turn instead to the unbiased internet for a second opinion.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
I bought this stuff because Alex told me this would help me turn the corner mentally,

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
but it hasn't really worked.

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
I just get all jittery, I can't sit still, and then I pass out without accomplishing anything.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,600
The real conspiracy is Jones' garbage products that he sells to ignorant people that believe his lies.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,680
I used to be one of them, but not after my horrible experience with Brain Force.

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,880
When I took Brain Force, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, and then the diarrhea started.

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,480
I tried to return the product, but they were rude and ignored me.

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,160
By all of these accounts, Brain Force fails to establish itself as a quality nootropic supplement.

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,560
They cut their one useful ingredient with cheap stimulants and sedatives

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,760
that are neither considered healthy nor effective.

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,600
Alex Jones and InfoWars both have an extremely negative reputation

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,680
within the scientific, medical, and business worlds,

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,800
and their products are considered low quality in general.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Pfft.

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Lastly, the vast majority of their previous users have negative things to say

57
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,080
about their experiences with the product.

58
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,520
There is no better judge of how effective a supplement can be

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,440
than the results it gets from normal people,

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,680
and they largely have not had positive things to say about its effects.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,560
How does Brain Force compare to similar nootropics?

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,240
Well, um...

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Uh...

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,640
But of course, there's no reason to trust Richard at dietsinreview.com.

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,160
After all, for all we know, he could be using, uh...

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,560
science to determine the effects of these supplements.

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,200
And science is known to be a tool of the establishment,

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,680

73
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,360
So I wouldn't trust that website either.

No, all we need to do to find out what we're putting into our bodies

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
is to look at the ingredients section.

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,640
So, using our heads, we can determine that instead of soy,

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,120
we're just getting pure, unadulterated...

Okay, okay, this might be a little confusing for some people.

If soy makes you effeminate and a leftist,

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,840
why is Paul, a right-wing Adonis-like perfect specimen of human masculinity,

103
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
happily recommending products that contain soy?

104
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
How do we resolve the deadlock between what Paul says and what Paul does?

105
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,520
Obviously, my first solution was to drink some raw milk to own the libs

106
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,840
and then have to have a light down for a little bit.

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,880
But when I got out of the hospital, I realized that the main problem

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
is that Paul simply doesn't have enough data

109
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,240
to determine whether or not soy is bad for him,

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
which is a problem that tends to come with ignoring all the data.

111
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,320
So we're going to have to test the effects of soy ourselves

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,480
without those pesky scientists surreptitiously inserting their misleading FACTS.

113
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,360
And as a fan of Paul's, um, journalism,

114
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,720
I volunteer my body to be the test.

115
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,840
The normal H-Bomber Guy diet, the HBG Classic,

116
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,920
consists mostly of coffee with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk,

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,520
porridge consumed on the toilet for maximum efficiency,

118
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
co-op chicken and bacon wraps,

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
co-op duck and hoisin sauce wraps,

120
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,000

124
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,160
and at some point also found out about my YouTube channel

125
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,440
and it's really embarrassing!

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,360
This isn't a joke! Shout out to Dan and Cullen if you're watching this!

And for dessert, co-op Easy Roll Puff pastry.

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm not fully certain I consume that much soy at all.

129
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
So let's change that.

130
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,880
My pal Alexis Berman on Twitter drew up a soy boy diet

131
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,960
which includes plenty of great examples of things containing soy

132
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,280
and I'll be largely sticking to it for the next 30 days

133
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,480
and recording my weight,

134
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,400
taking intrusive pictures of my body

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,560
and seeing if I become a puny effeminate weakling

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,920
right in time for my really buff and health-conscious cousin

137
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,320
to make fun of me at Christmas dinner

138
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
for the third year in a fucking row.

139
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,600
I just got back from Holland and Barrett,

140
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,120
a store I've never walked into before in my life.

141
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,080
My basic rule for this diet is that anything I can reasonably replace

142
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,880
with a soy-based product will be.

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,840
Soy yogurt, soy milk, soy replacements for meat and so on.

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,200
This will probably effectively double as a vegan diet

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,600
because all meats and animal products I would normally be eating

146
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,400
are being replaced for the purposes of ensuring I'm eating enough soy

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
for this test to be efficient.

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,160
Basically, the only soy product I won't be consuming

149
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,080
is Brain Force Plus because holy shit,

150
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,000
have you seen the reviews? It's fucking terrible!

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,360
See you in around 30 days when I cover the effects of this ridiculous test

152
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,120
and also do a more in-depth debunking

153
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,240
of the bizarre conspiracy theorist ideology

154
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,960
behind nonsense like Paul's video.

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,640
I've already done my initial weigh-in.

156
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,400
I've censored it, though, because after filming this,

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,240
I realized I was holding a pretty heavy camera

158
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,960
that would severely affect the results.

159
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
So I'm gonna have to weigh myself again later.

160
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,040
You know what they say about the camera adding 10 pounds?

161
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,560
It was significantly more than 10 pounds.

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,800
I'll be documenting everything I eat over on Patreon

163
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,960
for people who are super interested in the things I'm putting into my mouth

164
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
and maybe I'll record some little bonus videos

165
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,240
about the experience of eating vegan meat replacement foods

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
for the first time in my life.

167
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,960
And as a send-off for meat in my diet for at least the next 30 days,

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,520
I got myself my favorite meat-based product.

169
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,640
Thanks for watching, and until next time,

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm trying to think of a comical food to avoid eating

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
in case it turns you into a leftist,

173
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,840
but these people are literally afraid of beans and water.

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,400
So I can't think of anything funnier than that.

175
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,600
You can't own them any harder than they're owning themselves.

176
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
So I guess I'll soy you in a month.

177
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,600
These are actually quite hard to peel.

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,120
Would be really cool if I peeled it right as I said that, wouldn't it?

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,920
I guess I'll soy you in a month.

180
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Great.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
You know, the basic amount of nutritional research I did

182
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,080
to form the basis of the diet I'm gonna be doing

183
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,880
has led me to realize

184
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,960
that I actually don't want to eat any more of these.

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
So I can't even do the ending I'd planned.
