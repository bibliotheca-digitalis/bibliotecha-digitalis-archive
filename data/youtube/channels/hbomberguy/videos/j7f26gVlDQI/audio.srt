1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Ah, here I am in my childhood bedroom.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,620
That's what it is. This is what my childhood bedroom was.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,340
Look, I think all that matters is that I had a normal childhood

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,340
and my experience is made for hashtag relatable content!

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,040
AHH!

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
Because recently I've been thinking an awful lot about nostalgia.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,340
You're probably wondering, why are you filming on a bed with all of these stuffed toys?

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,560
Are you trying to rip off Jenny Nicholson so that you can finally catch up to her in terms of subscribers?

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,160
And the answer to that question is...

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeah. But also, for another reason.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Okay, we're gonna get into some real deep Hbomb lore here.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,160
But for the first... decade of my channel,

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,420
it was basically just a place where I posted whatever random videos I thought were funny,

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,300
and Let's Plays and stuff like that.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,880
But I also used to do, like, a web series that was making fun of video blogs.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,760
It was just me with a camcorder messing about. It was silly.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,300
In that old video series, I used to have a sequence where I would go to my bed

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,100
to answer viewer emails.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,940
And really, it was just a way of using all the jokes that I thought of

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,480
that had nothing to do with the rest of the theme of the video.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,900
Basically, it was just a technique used to justify doing something

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,820
completely unrelated to what people actually wanted or expected.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,620
And, um...

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,160
So I'm using it now for a different reason.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,360
Sitting on these bed...

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
These bed...

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,240
Because sitting on this bed with these ancient sheets from...

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,040
1996? 7? I'm guessing?

29
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,740
Makes me feel nostalgic for an earlier point in my life.

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,120
And that's what this video is gonna be about.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,380
Speaking of the past, the 1980s were really...

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,000
interesting.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,840
I was born in the 90s, so my real love was the stuff I had access to,

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,340
like PokÃ©mon and Power Rangers, you know, where they beat up cool monsters

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
and did fighting and there was explosions and giant robots.

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,500
It was a kid's dream.

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,700
And the music was so catchy that they've been reusing that same riff

38
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,920
in bits of music for the last, like, 25 years.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,220
Oh, wow.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,260
I've learned how to feel old.

41
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,340
But a secret fascination of mine was the 80s.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,800
To me, they were like the dark times.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,260
This period from before I was born and we had all of these ancient artifacts from it

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,520
that only I could make sense of.

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,220
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and He-Man and the Transformers

46
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,300
weren't really for me.

47
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,560
They were for kids from a previous generation.

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,800
And luckily for me, thanks to VHS, a format that I've heard someone cool made a video about once,

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,220
I could re-watch these ancient stories from the before time over and over

50
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,180
without ever having to develop a personality.

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,560
Transformers in particular was really cool.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,860
But then one day in Blockbusters,

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,600
and I only realize now how dated this video is going to be,

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,100
I saw a copy of a tape for The Transformers The Movie.

55
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,900
And that's weird because I thought movies were for adults and not kids

56
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,320
who watch their favorite stuff at 5 in the morning or however early I used to be able to wake up.

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,860
So I forced my dad to rent it and I spent a weekend watching it over and over

58
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,100
and storing all of its images in my brain for the rest of time.

59
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,860
There are some powerful images in that film which will never leave me.

60
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,600
I never learned an instrument.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,100
["Turkish March"]

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,680
But in my adolescent and then later adult years,

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,600
I noticed that a lot of people my age or slightly older

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,480
didn't really remember the show in that much detail

65
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,980
but still remembered a lot of stuff from that movie and they might not have even seen it for decades.

66
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,680
And I've been curious for quite a while about how it ended up that way

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,280
so lately I re-watched some of the show and then the movie to try to figure out how to...

68
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,480
Actually, no.

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,860
I don't really have a justification for my life choices in such a clear-cut way like that.

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,280
To be honest, most of my videos are me hastily writing an introduction and a conclusion

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,560
to the bit that I just felt like making for no particular reason

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,900
and this time I just don't have one.

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,780
I'm going to talk about The Transformers show and the 1986 movie

74
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,960
for an amount of time and you can watch it if you'd like.

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm gonna make that the thumbnail.

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,120
["Turkish March"]

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,460
Something I didn't really realize as a kid and probably should have done

78
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,120
is that The Transformers show is basically just a really explicit toy commercial.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,340
I was really curious how a show could come to be like this

80
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,460
so I asked my father, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, how it came to be

81
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,880
and he told me it was all the fault of that capitalist pig dog, Reagan.

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,260
Ronald McDonald's Reagan was, of course, president of the United States for most of the 80s

83
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,380
and he famously hated regulation almost as much as he hated South American civilians.

84
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,340
I believe that prior to Reagan, broadcasters weren't allowed to do more than 12 minutes per hour of advertising

85
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,380
and, you know, a show which is basically selling a toy probably would have counted as advertising.

86
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,760
Reagan took office in 1981 and his FCC oversaw a complete overhaul of all these regulations,

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,140
putting the free market in charge of what children could see.

88
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,140
And as we know, Reagan's policies are beyond criticism.

89
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,640
My generation grew up being advertised to every waking moment of their entire lives

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,520
and all of us turned out fine.

91
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,760
And that allowed the creation of shows like My Little Pony, G.I. Joe, He-Man,

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Mask, which I just remembered now while filming this bit,

93
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,020
and, yes, Silverhawks.

94
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,320
Partly metal, partly regal.

95
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,820
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

96
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,940
I mean the Transformers.

97
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,900
These robots fight every episode and then at the end the status quo is usually restored

98
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:48,600
and maybe another robot turns up who can show off their amazing new abilities.

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,980
And it's in stores now.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,900
And by now, I mean 30 years ago.

101
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,200
Oh my god.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,620
I think the go-to example from this of the episodes I watched is the one called Bot.

103
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,200
Okay, there's this one robot called Bruticus who's like a big, really powerful robot.

104
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,660
He's way bigger than all the others because he's actually made of five smaller Decepticons

105
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,620
and they all team up and go,

106
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,160
BLEH!

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,660
He's the most powerful one.

108
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,240
He's just this utter destructive killing machine.

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,620
Anyway, in this episode, he gets shot once and completely falls apart.

110
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:29,160
Destroyed so completely that four of the five robots are just in bits, like, dead.

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,620
And there's only one survivor.

112
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,740
So getting completely obliterated and literally scrapped for parts

113
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,500
and the parts get put in other things.

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,120
They put the personality component in another robot for a while and, like, it runs off

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,460
and there's this really funny shot of it, like, diving through a window.

116
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,100
Anyway, so that can happen, but it's fine.

117
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,760
They just get rebuilt and they're totally okay.

118
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,800
There is no real death in this universe.

119
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,880
That's fine. I'm not asking for a children's show in which there's murder.

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,260
It's actually a really effective way of writing a show with a limited cast of characters.

121
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,300
It means that you can have people getting beat up, people get destroyed,

122
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,920
there are fights and people lose badly,

123
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,220
but they can be rebuilt so they can carry on going

124
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,640
so you don't have to continuously be churning out new characters.

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,360
It's also quite similar to how kids play with toys.

126
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
You know, when you're a kid and one of your toys dies in whatever thing you're playing,

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,900
you don't give it, like, a Viking funeral and then, like, you, like, bury it in the ground

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,320
because you can't use it anymore.

129
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,400
That's my secret strategy for winning in Warhammer.

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,940
I insist on giving every character of mine that gets killed a proper funeral with a eulogy.

131
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,360
After, like, the fifth one, my opponent always surrenders.

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,020
They never want to play with me again,

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,120
but I like to think it's because I taught them a harsh lesson about the horrors of war.

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,540
Basically, Transformers is the kind of story where no one can really die.

135
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,500
Youâyou get blown up, then they put you back together at the end of the episode,

136
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,800
and then you do it all again. It's that kind of show.

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,500
It's very comfy and easy to get into a rhythm, and you can watch a hundred episodes of it,

138
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,960
and it's not particularly challenging, but it doesn't have to be.

139
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
It's for kids.

140
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,380
And it's actually quite nice and relaxing to live in a universe where seemingly nobody can die.

141
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,500
Yeah, it's quite nice.

142
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,800
Anyway, in the opening of the Transformers movie, a planet gets destroyed and millions of people die.

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,600
...

144
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,260
Yeah, there's aâthere's a bit of a tone difference in the movie.

145
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,520
âª

146
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,560
Like, we see an actual civilization full of people going about their everyday business.

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,700
There's even, like, malls and shopping centers.

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,640
And then we get to watch them get completely obliterated and devoured by this giant monster.

149
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,820
I don't really remember the movie being that different as a kid.

150
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,560
I remember the show being, like, really cool and kind of violent.

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,660
There was lasers and explosions.

152
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,860
But as an adult, the difference is, like, so clear and shocking.

153
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,820
Something is clearly very different from the previously consequence-free cartoon.

154
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,540
IâI mean, the episode where the guy gets blown up into tiny pieces and put back together

155
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,800
is the episode before the movie.

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,560
And it's, like, you go right from that to this!

157
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,100
Let's take a moment to talk about Unicron as a character.

158
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Because, as a kid, he was the big bad guy robot of the movie.

159
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,020
But as an adult, I think Unicron represents something, actually stands in for something.

160
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Um...

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,280
Nihilism?

162
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,440
Like, the Transformers universe has a god, according to its wiki.

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,120
He's called Primus. I think in some continuities, he's literally Cybertron.

164
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,580
And, you know, just hideâpretend to be a planet. It's a robot in disguise!

165
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:38,580
But, at least in the philosophical sense, Unicron is the closest thing we see in this universe to, like, a god.

166
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Like, it's absolutely gigantic. It's incomprehensibly powerful.

167
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,500
It can destroy entire planets.

168
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:52,100
But what's interesting about itânot him, itâis it doesn't do it because it's evil or bad.

169
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,140
Maybe they change this in characterization later.

170
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,800
But in the film, it's very clear that it's eating.

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,680
This is how it feeds to survive.

172
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,720
It's this almost Lovecraftian thing.

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,040
It's so much bigger than us, and all it wants to do is eat.

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,720
And we just happen to be food on the planet it's eating.

175
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:22,440
And its insides are this bizarre and inscrutable seething mass of machines that just crunch andâand jitter and spark.

176
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,120
There was a negative review of the film in the LA Times by Charles Solomon,

177
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,720
which criticized, like, all aspects of the movie. He didn't really like it.

178
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,360
But he singles out Unicron, and I actually wrote this down.

179
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,160
Um...

180
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,520
The great animated villains, like the Wicked Queen in Disney's Snow White,

181
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,720
had motivations as compelling as any live-action character.

182
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,040
Unicron apparently destroys entire worlds because it has nothing else to do.

183
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,840
Now, personally, I think that's a kind of overly mechanistic way of looking at a film,

184
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,400
where you break down what theâwhat the motivation is,

185
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,920
and if the motivation isn't good according to some arbitrary standards, then it's bad.

186
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,720
Like, it's missing the forest for the trees by assuming a character has to be written a certain way to count as good.

187
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,360
For me, this criticism misses the actual terrifying thing about the character,

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,400
which is precisely that Unicron devours entire worlds because it has nothing else to do.

189
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,080
There's just something inevitable and huge about it.

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,640
It's this reminder that the universe is cold and senseless and will just kill you because it can.

191
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,400
And it's like, oh, I'm more scared of this movie now than when I was a baby.

192
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,800
The character Unicron most directly evokes,

193
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,600
and by evokes I mean ripped off, they definitely just stole it,

194
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,320
is Galactus from the Marvel Comics continuity universe thing.

195
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,560
Look out for him in Phase...12...point...5...movie...103?

196
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,760
Avengers...

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,040
The Return of Jafar.

198
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Stan Lee and Jack Kirby came up with Galactus in 1966, way before Unicron.

199
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,480
Unicron's human form has horns that kind of resemble Galactus's headdress thing.

200
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,800
That might not be intentional, but I hope it was,

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,000
because the rest of the character was clearly taken from that as well.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,440
Galactus is a invincible, or almost invincible, whatever,

203
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,240
godlike entity that eats planets to survive.

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,640
In an interview, Jack Kirby wrote this about Galactus.

205
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,480
Galactus is a sort of god.

206
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,600
He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion.

207
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And this is kind of what I find interesting about Unicron.

208
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,200
Its life cycle just involves eating whole planets.

209
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,120
It's not got a moral compunction to do it.

210
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,160
It's just trying to survive, and it will genocide you.

211
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,280
Like, that's, like, a different kind of horror to the sorts of evil

212
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,680
that we normally think about in morality plays and children's media and stuff like that.

213
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,440
And Stan Lee said this about him.

214
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Galactus was simply another in a long line of supervillains who we loved creating.

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,480
We felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evildoer

216
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,560
who had almost godlike powers.

217
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,960
Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demigod.

218
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,560
But now what would we do with him?

219
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,080
We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world.

220
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,560
There were enough would-be world conquerors in the Marvel Universe

221
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,800
and in all the other comic book galaxies.

222
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
That was when inspiration struck.

223
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,120
Why not have him not be a really evil person?

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,720
After all, a demigod should be beyond mere good and evil.

225
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,760
He'd just be, don't laugh, hungry.

226
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,080
And the nourishment he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets.

227
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,920
Now, the phrase,

228
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
beyond mere good and evil,

229
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,440
really sticks out to me here?

230
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,080
Not just because it's the name of a book by Friedrich Nietzsche,

231
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,280
like a work of philosophical aphorisms that are all about

232
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,520
dealing specifically with how we build the morality in the wake

233
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,320
of the discovery that our previous assumptions,

234
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,520
like that there was a god who guaranteed good and evil,

235
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,360
just didn't exist.

236
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,400
Like, boiling it down,

237
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,200
it's a book about how to build a philosophy in the wake of there not being a god.

238
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Like, the exact themes that are being presented in this film.

239
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,720
But also because that same phrase is repeated again in the tagline of this movie.

240
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,760
It's even in the trailer.

241
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,440
Unicron, like Galactus, is really compelling

242
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,240
because, in its own cartoonish, for kids-y way,

243
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,400
it's dealing with actual moral and philosophical questions

244
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,040
about how we live in the universe?

245
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,200
Like, its very existence, its incursion into this ideological universe,

246
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,920
is this statement.

247
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,840
There is no divine plan,

248
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,200
you are all going to die,

249
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
you are tiny,

250
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,240
and the universe is gonna eat you.

251
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,200
The sort of,

252
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,800
ooh, I want Energon to fight a war so I can be in charge,

253
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,240
evil of Megatron,

254
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,960
is utterly fucking dwarfed

255
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,680
by the magnificent horror of this awful thing.

256
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,440
I even feel bad calling Unicron awful,

257
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,280
it's just, it just is.

258
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,840
Basically, Unicron is an absolutely awesome character,

259
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,320
and I really like it.

260
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,200
And this tone shift doesn't just involve the deaths of a bunch of never-before-seen alien robots.

261
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,880
In the beginning, Megatron and co. surprise attack an Autobot ship,

262
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,400
and all four of the robots on it, who are characters from the show,

263
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,760
just get murked.

264
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,920
They get Game of Thrones'd,

265
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
they just get killed, they die,

266
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,840
and then they take that ship,

267
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,920
and they take it to Autobot City,

268
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
and there's another big fight,

269
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,120
and, like, a bunch of them die.

270
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,360
The wiki has a special article just for it,

271
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,200
it's the Battle of Autobot City.

272
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,800
And there's just, like, a list of all the characters who died

273
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,120
in the first, like, ten minutes of this movie.

274
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,280
Prowl's death is especially shocking,

275
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,680
like, you see smoke emerge from his mouth and eyes and face

276
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,600
as he goes out, he's just dead.

277
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,400
This is a character from a show that you spent two seasons going,

278
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,640
well, it's okay, they get put back together, it's fine,

279
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,800
and he's just dead.

280
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,680
Megatron repeatedly shoots Optimus Prime in the chest,

281
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,240
and Prime haymakers him off the top of a building,

282
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,640
and he falls, like, multiple stories to the ground.

283
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,240
And they're both, like, fatally wounded and have to be dragged to safety.

284
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,800
And it's not like the show, where they get put back together,

285
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Optimus Prime...

286
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,920
dies.

287
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,000
In the next scene, he gets this, like, deathbed goodbye.

288
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,840
And you watch the light fade from his eyes.

289
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
It's worth talking about why this was happening.

290
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,080
Hasbro were making some changes to the toy line,

291
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,360
and they thought, well, in the movie,

292
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,360
get rid of the old characters and introduce the new ones.

293
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,000
And there is something, like, still, even to me now,

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,840
genuinely quite sad about this scene,

295
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,600
especially after having just watched the show.

296
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
We had two seasons of silly cartoon fights of Megatron,

297
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,320
and this time they just murdered each other?

298
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,640
The father figure of the show is just gone,

299
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,200
and there isn't really anyone left to take his place.

300
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,000
And, like, that's really sad.

301
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
And this obviously had a massive impact on its audience.

302
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,000
Like, kids were crying in the theater and had to be dragged out.

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
There were tons of complaints.

304
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,560
Flint Dill has gone on the record as saying that, like,

305
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,840
he didn't really think it would have this kind of impact.

306
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
I'll get somebody saying,

307
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,400
how come you killed Optimus Prime?

308
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,320
I cried when you killed Optimus Prime.

309
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,640
But the real answer is that we, you know,

310
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,800
we didn't know that he was an icon.

311
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,240
As be- it was a toy show.

312
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,640
We just thought we were killing off the old product line,

313
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,920
introducing a new product.

314
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,400
And, you know, Optimus Prime was one of those guys.

315
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,040
They didn't think that they created, like, a cultural icon,

316
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,000
and, in a way,

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,160
I don't think they had created such an icon until they killed him.

318
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,040
And what makes it so impactful isn't just that people know the character.

319
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,520
If you had a scene like that for a character no one knew about,

320
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,800
it wouldn't be that interesting.

321
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,320
It's the specific juxtaposition of this

322
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,760
with the kind of immortal,

323
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,800
everything's fine, don't worry about it, nature of the show.

324
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,440
It just invented death in a universe where previously that couldn't happen,

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,920
and for a kid that's way, way more shocking than something you know just dying.

326
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,600
It's that specific contrast.

327
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,320
And I think this specifically is what makes the movie interesting,

328
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,080
and makes the movie and the show by relation

329
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,560
such a memorable pop cultural artifact.

330
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,240
It's this specific change they made,

331
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,480
which they didn't have to in the movie.

332
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,400
Like, in the show, as we explored, the story didn't really matter.

333
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,840
No one blinked an eye when everyone was dead for four million years.

334
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,280
Sometimes Megatron can fly.

335
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,360
Doesn't matter. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

336
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,000
All of a sudden, you do have to worry about it.

337
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,240
People can die now,

338
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,480
and that, to, like, a kid, is, like, a giant punch in the face.

339
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,120
It's like, oh god, there's a real world out there with consequences,

340
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,400
and I have to live in it.

341
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,400
For me, the introduction of Galactus and the death of Optimus Prime

342
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,000
are the actual beginning of the story of Transformers.

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,840
There are actual real big problems,

344
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,800
and not just these silly cartoony villains that you have to face.

345
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,560
There's this existential dread you have to somehow deal with,

346
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,480
and the people you look up to can go and just be gone,

347
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,520
and you might have to take their place,

348
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,640
or learn to make do in a world without them.

349
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
And how do you deal with that?

350
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,200
And all of a sudden, this silly show about space robots

351
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,480
has a meaningful story.

352
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,280
And I think that's why I find the Transformers movie so interesting,

353
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,360
and why I wanted to go back and think about it.

354
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,440
I didn't get a pet until I was a bit older,

355
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,680
so for me, like, the first time something that I knew about

356
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,000
and was kind of close to me died was the cartoon robot dad,

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,480
and the narrative of the movie actually explores

358
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,800
these really interesting questions and ideas

359
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,960
that you wouldn't expect to happen in the Transformers movie.

360
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,840
Questions like, how do you deal with the fact

361
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,640
that your existence is probably meaningless

362
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,680
and everyone you love can and will die?

363
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,040
These are, like, really important and difficult questions

364
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,560
that we as humans have been striving to try and answer

365
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,040
for hundreds if not thousands of years.

366
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,200
Like, that's basically all Friedrich Nietzsche did

367
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,760
until he, like, went mad and hugged a horse and died.

368
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,600
So ideally, the film would, in a perhaps kid-friendly way,

369
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,640
explore and maybe try and find some answers to these questions.

370
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,800
I said ideally there because it doesn't really.

371
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,320
Like, I've bigged this movie up a lot,

372
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,920
set up all the things about it that I like

373
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,880
and the interesting concepts that it kind of almost explores,

374
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,520
but the movie isn't very good.

375
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Like, for all the bits in it that I like or think are really interesting,

376
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,040
there is a lot of bullshit.

377
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,800
There's loads of scenes of characters just faffing about

378
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,320
and saying one-liners that no one ever thought was cool.

379
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,880
Most egregious is the guy who talks really, really fast

380
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,720
because his thing is he moves really fast

381
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
and the little one that, like, talks in rhymes.

382
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,920
What about me, Magnus? What about me?

383
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,280
Mm-ha, mm-ha, mm-ha. I can help. I want to help.

384
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,000
What about me?

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,080
Friend, fine. Look behind.

386
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,480
You go wrong way. You fool, I say.

387
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,520
Absolutely, positively, definitely.

388
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,720
Nobody can get this job done faster than I can.

389
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

390
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,640
I've gone out of my way to not learn their names

391
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,360
because I want their existence to slide from my memory as quickly as possible.

392
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,280
If you think this film is actually good,

393
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,080
it's because you forgot about 75% of it.

394
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,720
But the 25% of stuff that's decent,

395
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,840
it actually deals with some really interesting stuff sometimes.

396
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,920
One scene I really quite like is when Unicron eats two of Cybertron's moons

397
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,240
and Bumblebee sets a bomb to detonate while it's being eaten by Unicron and they escape

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,960
and then it just isn't affected by the explosion at all

399
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,120
and they get sucked into Unicron and eaten and they're just gone for the rest of the movie

400
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,320
and you only found out that they didn't die, like, right at the end.

401
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,680
It isn't even dented!

402
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,480
Oh, shit! What are we gonna do now?

403
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,120
They actually said a swear in the children's film.

404
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,600
That's how bad things have got for the main characters.

405
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,240
I actually find this really compelling even as an adult.

406
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,120
Watching the characters see this horrible thing coming

407
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,880
and try to formulate a way of attacking it and getting away

408
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,280
and watching it just fail utterly and watch them get sucked in anyway,

409
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,120
it's, like, really cool.

410
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,880
And I think there's an important thematic thing there,

411
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,240
like, the characters are coping with the death of a lot of their friends

412
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,200
and even their leader, like, someone tremendously important to them,

413
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,920
and Unicron, if it represents nihilism or this understanding that life is meaningless,

414
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,720
in a really direct, literalized way,

415
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,360
the characters are trying to deal with and fail to deal with

416
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,680
this gnawing emptiness that tells them that life is pain.

417
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,040
And the whole movie is really about trying to escape the pull of these feelings

418
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,360
and do something with your life,

419
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,520
even though you know that at the end of it you die

420
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,400
and maybe all things don't really matter.

421
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,320
Like, theâtheâthe ultimate question of the film, basically,

422
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,480
is, oh, shit, what do we do now?

423
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,800
Like, even as an adult, I was kind of sucked in.

424
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Like, what's gonna happen?

425
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,520
And the answer isâ¦ a lot of garbage.

426
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,960
âNice, dino, good dino, sweet dino,

427
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,980
won't you step into the night spaceship,

428
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,520
and blow up pretty, please, pretty, pretty, pretty, please, nice dino.

429
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,540
âI'm trying to get them to the shuttle,

430
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,000
what's so magical?

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,640
âI'm gonna get on the dino, get on the dino, get on the dino!

432
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,400
âOh, they're gonna mess about for a bit now,

433
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,640
Galvatron'll fly past and go,

434
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,480
ooh,

435
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,120
I'll get you.

436
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,240
Skrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

437
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,920
But I think we've established pretty successfully

438
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
what the questions of the movie are,

439
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
and that makes the scenes that are actually about that kind of cool

440
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,760
and interesting and cute

441
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,120
and stand out against the rubbish of the rest of the film.

442
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,840
There's a bit where Cup is telling this, like, old war story to the dinobots,

443
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,600
and they're all sitting around and listening,

444
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,560
and even Hot Rod's like,

445
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,640
why are you doing this?

446
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,680
What's the point of this?

447
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,640
We've got stuff to do.

448
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,040
And I find that scene actually really heartwarming and interesting.

449
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,760
Like, in the middle of this emotionally fraught situation

450
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,240
where bad stuff is happening and danger is present,

451
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,440
the character with the most knowledge and experience sits down and says,

452
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,600
let me tell you about another time it was bad.

453
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,520
And you realize, oh, wow,

454
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,320
when this movie's not just messing about,

455
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
it's actually just making a point here

456
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,760
about how, like, telling stories about other times when things were bad

457
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,640
helps us remember that things aren't actually bad all the time,

458
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,800
and there's lots of really good times

459
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,960
where life seems like it's worth living,

460
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
even if it ultimately isn't.

461
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,920
And you're like, oh.

462
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,880
There's, like, an interesting point here,

463
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,280
and it takes place in a scene

464
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,240
where a giant robot soldier is telling a bedtime story to a bunch of dinosaurs.

465
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,360
Like, in the context of the movie,

466
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,160
Unicron is really afraid of the Matrix of Leadership for some reason.

467
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,840
Like, it's the only thing that poses a threat to it.

468
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,440
And it's clear here what the Matrix of Leadership actually is.

469
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,680
It's all the stuff that the Autobots are doing to continue carrying on,

470
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,800
even when it seems pointless and like they can't win.

471
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,040
It's all the little things that actually constitute a morality.

472
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,200
That stuff is what allows the Autobots to carry on,

473
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,920
even when all of this bad stuff has happened.

474
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,360
And there's the specific thing that it's called the Matrix of Leadership,

475
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,040
and that begs the question of, like, what is leadership?

476
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,680
What was the je ne sais quoi that made Optimus Prime the cool guy?

477
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,600
And that's being explored here

478
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,080
in how the characters deal with this tough situation.

479
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,160
And what I find really interesting is that the guy who's picked as Prime's successor

480
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,400
is objectively really bad at the specific things required of leadership.

481
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,720
Like, Ultra Magnus even says in the scene, he's like,

482
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,480
But Prime, I'mâI'm just a soldier. IâI'm not worthy.

483
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,360
I am not a good successor to you.

484
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm just a guy who's good at the thing that he does.

485
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,160
And he's right. Like, Ultra Magnus makes leadership decisions in the movie,

486
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,760
and they always are basically just concessions

487
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,800
to the Decepticons that actually make the situation worse.

488
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,960
Like, he pulls this clever trick where he lets most of his ship be blown up

489
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,160
so that, like, a little bit of it with them on it can escape,

490
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,560
and that buys them, like, five minutes of time in the movie.

491
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,040
And then after that, he creates a diversion so that the rest of his pals can escape,

492
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,280
which gives him and the Matrix to Galvatron.

493
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,120
Basically, justâhe just loses.

494
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,880
He's just the highest-ranking guy.

495
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,720
He's not a conceptual leader-type figure.

496
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,680
He's not actually good at making the kind of high-concept decisions

497
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,560
a leader should make, whatever those may be.

498
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,080
I wonder if there's an answer to that question explored by the end of the story.

499
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,240
So that begs the ultimate questions.

500
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,640
What actually is leadership if it's not just being in charge?

501
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,440
And how do we make all of this work?

502
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,960
How do we make a positive change in a universe where it often seems hopeless?

503
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,360
And this gets explored on the other ship,

504
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,080
which also crash-lands, but on a different planet.

505
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,480
The one with Hot Rod and Cup and the Dinobots on it.

506
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,240
So they encounter these piranha-like, Transformer-ish robots,

507
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,280
and Cup's like,

508
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,560
We shouldn't fight them.

509
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,920
Let's do the universal greeting.

510
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,200
Don't act hostile.

511
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,440
I'll use the universal greeting.

512
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,280
Universal greeting?

513
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,160
Oh, we're going with this?

514
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,080
Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.

515
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,640
Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.

516
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,800
What I find interesting about this is the sheer friction

517
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,440
between the concept being explored and the way it's being explored.

518
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,840
Like, the idea of, in this vast universe with multiple different languages

519
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,640
and levels of intellect and consciousness,

520
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,920
the idea that there is a universal phrase

521
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,520
which to anyone means vaguely,

522
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,360
Hi, I'm your friend,

523
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,120
is, like, super fascinating.

524
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,560
Like, the idea of a universe where there is this central,

525
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,360
conceptual meaning and a way of communicating,

526
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,800
like, that's a thing.

527
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,240
And it's being explored by the robot saying,

528
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,760
Weep-a-boop-a-baaah.

529
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,320
Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.

530
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,600
See? The universal greeting works every time.

531
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,360
Bah-weep-boop-

532
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,280
I can't even be bothered to remember it.

533
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,000
It's so embarrassing and obnoxious,

534
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,080
and it just still makes me cringe.

535
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
And even as a kid, I was like,

536
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,040
Oh, no, I hope no one's watching me watching this.

537
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,760
I just, oh, God.

538
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,920
And it doesn't even work either.

539
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,600
They give them the candy, the laser candy,

540
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,560
and they run out and they just capture them anyway.

541
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,280
It doesn't work.

542
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,640
And this is another, like, cool way

543
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,280
that they juxtapose the reality of the story

544
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,520
with the kind of silliness of the cartoon.

545
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
They're like, no, this is real.

546
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
That childish nonsense doesn't work here.

547
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,320
You've got to be realistic.

548
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,920
You should have slaughtered those other sentient beings.

549
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,120
So they escape, they get on a ship,

550
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,280
and they go to pick up the other Autobots, right?

551
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,960
And then they have a repeat

552
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,640
of the last encounter they just had.

553
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,880
Like, they meet this new alien species

554
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,480
that might be possibly hostile,

555
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,600
and this time Kup's like,

556
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,640
let's just fucking shoot them.

557
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
We got them.

558
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,960
And then we get the point of the movie.

559
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,080
We get the moral core, the thesis of the film,

560
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,320
and it is simultaneously the silliest thing ever,

561
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,120
the worst, stupidest, most baddest scene ever,

562
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,000
and also amazing.

563
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,240
So Kup's gonna shoot them, right?

564
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
And Hot Rod goes,

565
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,560
no, I've discovered the moral core of the movie.

566
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
Let's do the universal greeting again.

567
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,240
What was that universal greeting again?

568
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,440
Never mind, I remember.

569
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,600
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

570
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,320
And they do it.

571
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,680
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

572
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,200
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

573
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,920
And it works.

574
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,080
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

575
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,520
And everyone's happy,

576
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,320
and they form like a circle around them,

577
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,840
and they do a big dance,

578
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,440
and everyone's their friend.

579
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,560
And then you're like, oh shit,

580
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,200
the movie's actually making a point here

581
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,000
with this incredibly childish thing.

582
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,800
The point is the childishness.

583
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,960
Like, the movie has just positioned

584
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,400
the naive and childish desire

585
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,200
to try to make friends in spite of everything

586
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,760
as the actual radical positive moral choice

587
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,360
to save the universe.

588
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,960
Where you try the thing,

589
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,480
even though the world has told you

590
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
it won't work and it'll be bad,

591
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,080
just in case it might.

592
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Just in case you might actually be able

593
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,600
to unite with these other people.

594
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,480
And sometimes it works.

595
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,400
Despite appearing on the surface

596
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,320
to be a deeply cynical movie,

597
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,920
what it's actually doing is setting up

598
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,760
all the really good reasons

599
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,000
that you should be cynical about the world

600
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,120
and your place in it,

601
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,240
and then saying,

602
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,400
no, it's actually really good

603
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,240
to be a bit naive sometimes.

604
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,680
And maybe that's the thing.

605
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,280
Maybe that's the miraculous way

606
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,440
that we build a morality in this universe.

607
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,760
We, perhaps in a somewhat silly way,

608
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,320
assert that this does matter

609
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,600
and everything can work,

610
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,040
even if it doesn't seem like it.

611
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,720
And this is the film answering the question

612
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
of what is leadership.

613
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,640
Hot Rods goes,

614
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,960
no, let's not do the tactically clever thing.

615
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,960
Let's be unrealistic.

616
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,560
Let's believe that a peaceful,

617
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,360
mutually beneficial outcome is possible,

618
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,040
and we can actually all get on

619
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
and have this peaceful encounter.

620
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,440
And it seems like an unrealistic and silly thing,

621
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,240
but someone there asserting

622
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,760
that they believe it is possible

623
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,760
causes it to happen.

624
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,080
And that is an actual philosophical statement

625
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,760
about how to live in the world,

626
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,160
to insist, if not demand,

627
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,120
that better things are possible,

628
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,560
even when it specifically doesn't seem possible at all.

629
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,840
Literally this scene,

630
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,760
where all of a sudden

631
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,720
there's an answer to the darkness of the universe,

632
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,480
the song that plays over the scene

633
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,200
is Weird Al Yankovic's Dare to be Stupid.

634
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,080
["Dare to be Stupid"]

635
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,640
And that's literally the moral core of the film.

636
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,960
You have to dare to be stupid.

637
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,120
You have to believe in the incredibly silly, idyllic thing.

638
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,560
Ultra Magnus and the other robots

639
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,880
immediately get, like, forlorn,

640
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,720
and they want to be cynical again,

641
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,360
and Hunter says,

642
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
no, don't think about it in terms of

643
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,040
whether or not we have the MacGuffin.

644
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,720
Think about it in terms of

645
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,360
what we can do now to make it work.

646
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,800
You know, there's this old thing

647
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,320
that a philosopher guy said once.

648
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,040
A leader isn't someone who tells you what to do

649
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,640
and you obey because he's in a position of power over you.

650
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,800
A leader is someone who talks

651
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,440
and then you realize you believe them

652
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,200
and you want that thing to happen as well.

653
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,800
And that great philosopher's name was Optimus Prime,

654
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,120
and I find this sort of positivity

655
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,960
radically reshapes the universe thing

656
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,680
happening as well with Unicron.

657
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,840
Like, Galvatron tries to use the Matrix

658
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,320
and he doesn't really know how to understand it,

659
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
but he does use it in some capacity

660
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,120
because it suddenly causes Unicron

661
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,520
to transform and unfold

662
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
and you actually get the coolest scene in the movie,

663
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,440
this really awesome transformation sequence

664
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,000
where he unfolds and moves and shifts

665
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,040
and it's got some of the best music ever.

666
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,280
Like, I've listened to the Unicron theme medley

667
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,920
like 1,500 times in my life over the last decade.

668
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
It's just incredible.

669
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,320
Just Unicron's theme in general

670
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,000
is just this epic thing

671
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,960
where it's a mix of synthesizers and drums

672
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,880
and there's like this industrial hissing

673
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,360
and it's just...

674
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,520
I realize that almost all of my musical interests

675
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,360
spring forth in some fashion

676
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,240
from the soundscape of the various iterations

677
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,000
of the Unicron theme in the movie.

678
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,600
It's also, like, really, really cool

679
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,200
that the best scene in the movie

680
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,640
is literally just a scene of something transforming.

681
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,840
It's just, this is literally the film

682
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,320
and it's really cool. I love it.

683
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,080
But this scene is also a continuation

684
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,440
of the themes of the story.

685
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,240
Like, we've just seen that the assertion

686
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,080
that things can be made better

687
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,840
allows the impossible to happen.

688
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,000
People who would have been your enemies

689
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,200
if you'd approached them differently

690
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,320
are suddenly your friends

691
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,760
and with the mere application of the belief

692
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,080
that something can be done about Unicron,

693
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,000
all of a sudden Unicron becomes a comprehensible threat.

694
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,880
Unicron becomes mortal in response to Galvatron

695
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,200
trying to use the Matrix against him

696
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,120
and I find that super interesting.

697
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,880
Like, that's literally the themes of the film.

698
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,800
If you believe something can be done,

699
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,640
all of a sudden maybe it actually can be.

700
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
So Hot Rod crashes his ship

701
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,400
right through Unicron's eye

702
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,240
and, like, all of a sudden

703
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,440
this basically god-like creature

704
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,720
that eats planets and can't be harmed

705
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,360
by massive moon-sized explosions

706
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
and can suck people in

707
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,440
even when they're trying to escape,

708
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,200
all of a sudden he's, like, gasping in pain.

709
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,520
He goes,

710
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,720
"[screams in pain, laughs evilly"]

711
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,800
And his eye, because it's been smashed apart

712
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,240
and the crash is timed

713
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,040
with the first line of Stan Bush's song,

714
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,360
"'Dare.'"

715
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,160
["Dare!" by Stan Bush plays in the background.]

716
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,000
Where, again, it's the thing about daring, again.

717
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,640
It's, like, daring is, by definition,

718
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,640
believing in something

719
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,200
which it's not realistic to believe.

720
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,040
And this isn't just a ridiculous 80s rock anthem

721
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,720
about generic positivity

722
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,960
playing over a toy commercial film.

723
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,000
I mean, it is that,

724
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,240
but in addition,

725
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,040
it's a really interesting declaration

726
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,760
that doing the supposedly clever thing,

727
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,360
the realistic thing,

728
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,800
isn't really enough.

729
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,200
Sometimes you have to demand the impossible.

730
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,040
One last scene that I really, really like

731
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,200
is the bit between Galvatron and Hot Rod

732
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,080
when they're fighting

733
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,360
and Galvatron's like,

734
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,200
"'We should probably just come out and be killed by me.

735
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I mean, we're all gonna die, right?'

736
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,640
["Come out, Autobot!

737
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,920
We all must die sometime!"

738
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,720
And Hot Rod goes,

739
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,320
"'No!'

740
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,520
and punches him.

741
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,120
"'Not today, Galvatron!'

742
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,960
And that exchange sums up the whole movie.

743
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,840
You know, the universe is dark and scary,

744
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,520
and maybe your life is meaningless,

745
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,240
and maybe we're all just sitting around waiting to die.

746
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,880
We're all just running out the biological clock,

747
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,560
but we're not gonna die today,

748
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,360
and things can be made better.

749
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,600
And this approach is what causes the Matrix

750
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,960
to finally activate and get all glowy and stuff,

751
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,440
and he's like,

752
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,640
"'I have the power!'

753
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,680
That's a different show.

754
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,800
I know it's a different show.

755
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,640
I was making a reference.

756
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,960
Stan Bush's The Touch starts playing,

757
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,480
and he gets all glowy,

758
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,320
and he transforms.

759
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,080
He evolves, and he doesn't hit B,

760
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,040
so it's permanent,

761
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,320
and he transforms into...

762
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,840
Rodimus Prime.

763
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,000
["Arise, Rodimus Prime!"

764
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,480
["Optimus!"

765
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,240
Come on, you almost let me use you

766
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,160
to make a really interesting point movie,

767
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,760
and then the main character's apotheosis

768
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,680
is to transform into someone called Rodimus Prime.

769
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,680
He's just, oh, there's a reason no one's taken this movie seriously

770
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,440
for 30 years.

771
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,360
Oh!"

772
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,320
And then he holds up the Matrix,

773
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,600
and Unicron explodes.

774
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,760
The power of leadership and hope

775
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,560
and unwarranted positivity in a dark universe

776
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,960
has successfully vanquished the pessimistic nihilism

777
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,320
that encroaches upon us all

778
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,000
when bad things happen in our lives.

779
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,760
Rodimus Prime discovered the magic of Xanax.

780
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,200
Rodimus Prime makes a speech about how, like,

781
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,640
now we're going to live in a world of peace

782
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,080
where everyone can be a part of this beautiful new world.

783
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,640
Just this ridiculously optimistic speech.

784
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,200
["We march forward to a new age of peace and happiness

785
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,800
till all are one!"

786
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,760
And it's like, yeah,

787
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,600
and then Unicron's head flies past,

788
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,160
and that's the end.

789
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,240
It just ends on that speech with the music playing

790
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,960
just like that.

791
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,760
We beat you.

792
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,160
Let's all live in peace and happiness forever.

793
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,720
Done.

794
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,360
Credits.

795
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,760
Go.

796
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,480
Just have a nice day, everyone.

797
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:51,960
I love it.

798
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,200
So yeah, it's not really that great a movie,

799
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,960
and the scenes that stand out,

800
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,880
especially to the kids who remembered it

801
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,960
from the time they first saw it,

802
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,880
they stand out usually because it was busy killing

803
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,720
a character that was well-known and important to you.

804
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,200
Like, it wasn't impactful because it was good.

805
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,280
It was impactful because it was horrifying

806
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,040
in, like, a really terrible way for a kid.

807
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,440
It didn't really stand out because of its quality.

808
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,080
Like, I find that I keep every couple of years

809
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,480
coming back to this movie in some form.

810
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,360
This movie is unmistakably a kind of standard

811
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,720
hero's journey transition into adulthood thing for Hot Rod.

812
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,200
Growing up, I appreciate that far more

813
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,840
because, like, I and a lot of the kids who watch this movie

814
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
have had to mature into adults

815
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,680
and encounter some of the emotions

816
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,400
that were first brought up for some kids in this film.

817
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,800
A lot of people have had to deal with the death of a parent

818
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,120
or someone really close to them and learn to cope with that.

819
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,200
And it's hard not to, in that process,

820
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,520
look back on a movie that is kind of about

821
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,640
dealing with those things.

822
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,040
Like, in a way, the Transformers movie

823
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,000
is more meaningful to adults now

824
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,720
than it ever could have been for kids then.

825
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,960
I think I find myself coming back to this movie

826
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,040
because I never feel like I'm quite done thinking about it

827
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,280
because its meaning keeps changing for me

828
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,560
as I keep changing as a person.

829
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,640
I, as a person, have grown up and changed a lot

830
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,240
in the last 10, 15, 20 years of my life.

831
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,840
A lot of things in the world have changed

832
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,800
and, in a way, one of the ways that you learn to deal with it

833
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,320
and fully appreciate those things

834
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,800
is you go back to something that you felt you knew

835
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:42,840
and look at it with the benefit of the new site that you have.

836
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,040
And I find that I keep doing this

837
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,880
with the Transformers movie in particular.

838
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Like, five years ago, when I was just really into

839
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
how clever I thought I was,

840
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,480
I used to write for this website called smugfilm.com.

841
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,840
Like, that was supposed to be a joke.

842
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,160
Like, haha, we know how silly this looks.

843
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,560
But really, no, everyone on that site was pretty smug,

844
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,520
especially me.

845
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,280
And five years ago now, in 2014,

846
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,160
I wrote a piece about how the Transformers movie

847
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,360
is actually about the Nietzschean ideal.

848
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,360
How it's this, like, radical rebuttal to philosophical nihilism.

849
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,760
Like, that was incredibly silly.

850
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,000
But there was a time in my life

851
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,960
where I genuinely felt that way about the film

852
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,520
and felt that way about how to think about the world.

853
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,520
And one of the ways that I allowed myself to develop

854
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,880
was by reinvestigating what I had previously thought of

855
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,760
as just this fun movie that I thought was cool when I was a kid.

856
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,360
Like, in a way, it's only through nostalgia

857
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,760
that we understand the present

858
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,640
by fully accepting how we used to see something.

859
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,000
Don't read that article, by the way.

860
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,480
It's really not that great.

861
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,240
In fact, I still have some beef with the guy who ran the site.

862
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,240
He would edit the articles to be what he thought sounded better

863
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,000
and he would cut a bunch of the words out.

864
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,200
Like, I remember my original article being, like, twice as long

865
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,480
and he, like, cut out all my favorite bits and reworded some of it

866
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,800
and it just, I don't know, it just kind of annoyed me.

867
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,920
Don't read the old article, anyway.

868
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,880
It was bad before.

869
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,240
It was bad before it was edited.

870
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,360
We are all, in a very specific sense,

871
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,960
undergoing this eternal and never truly finished transformation.

872
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,640
We're always becoming something else

873
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,240
and this is one of the ways that we come to understand who we are now

874
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,160
is by looking at the things from our past with the new lens that we have

875
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,120
and, like, that, I think, is the value of nostalgia.

876
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,920
You have the ability to look back not just on something from the past

877
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,400
but on how you were in the past.

878
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,560
I think a lot of people are nostalgic for movies

879
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,440
not because there's something particularly great

880
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,160
about living in the 80s or something

881
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,000
but because being a kid in the 80s

882
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,040
when the worst thing that could possibly happen to you that day

883
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,760
was the cartoon dad robot died.

884
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,280
Like, that is a really nice time to be alive

885
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,560
that we all kind of, on some level, do appreciate more now that we don't have it.

886
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,040
We're coming up on, like, in a couple of months,

887
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,560
the 10-year anniversary of Lindsay Ellis's video about the Transformers movie.

888
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,280
She hates it.

889
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,800
She thinks it's terrible.

890
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,440
Like, 10 years.

891
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,560
I wasn't joking earlier in the video where I talked about how old I felt.

892
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,560
Like, in a way, this video is, like, a very brief midlife crisis for me

893
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,600
where I look back on how I used to think about some stuff

894
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,800
and my old YouTube videos and the things I used to do

895
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,560
and try and figure out where I've changed

896
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,720
and where I'm going and what I'm supposed to do

897
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,800
and I think the reason why I turn back to Transformers

898
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,440
is because it shouts the loudest and clearest,

899
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,560
the most valuable message for someone in that state,

900
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,080
which is demand the impossible.

901
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,600
Believe that it can be better even if it doesn't seem that way

902
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,280
and that's how finding the way out becomes possible

903
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,200
and I guess I never really stopped believing in the silly cartoon.

904
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,480
I just find better and better ways to intellectualize it.

905
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,760
For the first time in my life, I feel old.

906
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,360
I've felt like I was 19 until I was 26

907
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,960
and now I feel like an old person

908
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,560
and it's made me go,

909
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,240
well, who am I?

910
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,640
And looking back on all my old videos, it makes me think,

911
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,440
wow, I thought this was funny

912
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,480
and maybe I miss having that much future ahead of me

913
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,000
but it makes me happy to be who I am now.

914
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,240
It's fun realizing that while the past had its benefits,

915
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,320
the present and the future are pretty cool too.

916
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,080
This movie is a part of my process of thinking about life and the world

917
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,480
so it's been fun using it as an excuse to talk about these ideas now.

918
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,120
So, yeah, thanks for tuning in to my midlife crisis.

919
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,160
It's over now. I feel good again.

920
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,600
Thank you very much to the people who support me doing this

921
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,360
because I literally, literally couldn't be here doing this without you.

922
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,040
So for me now, the Transformers movie is unavoidably

923
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,760
about dealing with having to mature into a world

924
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,160
where no one really knows what's going on

925
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,240
and you have to somehow figure it out for yourself

926
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,200
and that makes the movie interesting to me even now,

927
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,360
even though it's measurably bad.

928
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,960
I guess the movie was more than meets the eye.

929
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,200
Oh my god.
