00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Ah, here I am in my childhood bedroom.

00:03.500 --> 00:06.620
That's what it is. This is what my childhood bedroom was.

00:06.620 --> 00:10.340
Look, I think all that matters is that I had a normal childhood

00:10.340 --> 00:14.340
and my experience is made for hashtag relatable content!

00:14.340 --> 00:15.040
AHH!

00:15.040 --> 00:17.760
Because recently I've been thinking an awful lot about nostalgia.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.340
You're probably wondering, why are you filming on a bed with all of these stuffed toys?

00:22.340 --> 00:27.560
Are you trying to rip off Jenny Nicholson so that you can finally catch up to her in terms of subscribers?

00:27.660 --> 00:29.160
And the answer to that question is...

00:30.120 --> 00:32.200
Yeah. But also, for another reason.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.200
Okay, we're gonna get into some real deep Hbomb lore here.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.160
But for the first... decade of my channel,

00:39.160 --> 00:43.420
it was basically just a place where I posted whatever random videos I thought were funny,

00:43.420 --> 00:45.300
and Let's Plays and stuff like that.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.880
But I also used to do, like, a web series that was making fun of video blogs.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.760
It was just me with a camcorder messing about. It was silly.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.300
In that old video series, I used to have a sequence where I would go to my bed

00:56.300 --> 00:58.100
to answer viewer emails.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.940
And really, it was just a way of using all the jokes that I thought of

01:00.940 --> 01:03.480
that had nothing to do with the rest of the theme of the video.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.900
Basically, it was just a technique used to justify doing something

01:07.900 --> 01:10.820
completely unrelated to what people actually wanted or expected.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.620
And, um...

01:13.240 --> 01:16.160
So I'm using it now for a different reason.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.360
Sitting on these bed...

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
These bed...

01:19.200 --> 01:23.240
Because sitting on this bed with these ancient sheets from...

01:23.240 --> 01:27.040
1996? 7? I'm guessing?

01:27.460 --> 01:31.740
Makes me feel nostalgic for an earlier point in my life.

01:31.740 --> 01:34.120
And that's what this video is gonna be about.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.380
Speaking of the past, the 1980s were really...

01:38.260 --> 01:39.000
interesting.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.840
I was born in the 90s, so my real love was the stuff I had access to,

01:42.840 --> 01:47.340
like PokÃ©mon and Power Rangers, you know, where they beat up cool monsters

01:47.360 --> 01:51.040
and did fighting and there was explosions and giant robots.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.500
It was a kid's dream.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.700
And the music was so catchy that they've been reusing that same riff

01:55.700 --> 01:59.920
in bits of music for the last, like, 25 years.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.220
Oh, wow.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.260
I've learned how to feel old.

02:05.260 --> 02:08.340
But a secret fascination of mine was the 80s.

02:08.340 --> 02:10.800
To me, they were like the dark times.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.260
This period from before I was born and we had all of these ancient artifacts from it

02:15.260 --> 02:17.520
that only I could make sense of.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.220
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and He-Man and the Transformers

02:21.220 --> 02:23.300
weren't really for me.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.560
They were for kids from a previous generation.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.800
And luckily for me, thanks to VHS, a format that I've heard someone cool made a video about once,

02:31.800 --> 02:36.220
I could re-watch these ancient stories from the before time over and over

02:36.220 --> 02:39.180
without ever having to develop a personality.

02:39.180 --> 02:41.560
Transformers in particular was really cool.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.860
But then one day in Blockbusters,

02:43.860 --> 02:46.600
and I only realize now how dated this video is going to be,

02:46.600 --> 02:51.100
I saw a copy of a tape for The Transformers The Movie.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.900
And that's weird because I thought movies were for adults and not kids

02:53.900 --> 02:58.320
who watch their favorite stuff at 5 in the morning or however early I used to be able to wake up.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.860
So I forced my dad to rent it and I spent a weekend watching it over and over

03:02.860 --> 03:08.100
and storing all of its images in my brain for the rest of time.

03:08.140 --> 03:11.860
There are some powerful images in that film which will never leave me.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.600
I never learned an instrument.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.100
["Turkish March"]

03:15.100 --> 03:18.680
But in my adolescent and then later adult years,

03:18.680 --> 03:22.600
I noticed that a lot of people my age or slightly older

03:22.600 --> 03:25.480
didn't really remember the show in that much detail

03:25.480 --> 03:29.980
but still remembered a lot of stuff from that movie and they might not have even seen it for decades.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.680
And I've been curious for quite a while about how it ended up that way

03:32.680 --> 03:37.280
so lately I re-watched some of the show and then the movie to try to figure out how to...

03:38.360 --> 03:40.480
Actually, no.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.860
I don't really have a justification for my life choices in such a clear-cut way like that.

03:46.860 --> 03:51.280
To be honest, most of my videos are me hastily writing an introduction and a conclusion

03:51.280 --> 03:55.560
to the bit that I just felt like making for no particular reason

03:55.560 --> 03:57.900
and this time I just don't have one.

03:57.900 --> 04:02.780
I'm going to talk about The Transformers show and the 1986 movie

04:02.780 --> 04:07.960
for an amount of time and you can watch it if you'd like.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.280
I'm gonna make that the thumbnail.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.120
["Turkish March"]

04:14.120 --> 04:18.460
Something I didn't really realize as a kid and probably should have done

04:18.460 --> 04:22.120
is that The Transformers show is basically just a really explicit toy commercial.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.340
I was really curious how a show could come to be like this

04:25.340 --> 04:29.460
so I asked my father, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, how it came to be

04:29.460 --> 04:32.880
and he told me it was all the fault of that capitalist pig dog, Reagan.

04:32.880 --> 04:37.260
Ronald McDonald's Reagan was, of course, president of the United States for most of the 80s

04:37.260 --> 04:42.380
and he famously hated regulation almost as much as he hated South American civilians.

04:42.380 --> 04:48.340
I believe that prior to Reagan, broadcasters weren't allowed to do more than 12 minutes per hour of advertising

04:48.340 --> 04:53.380
and, you know, a show which is basically selling a toy probably would have counted as advertising.

04:53.380 --> 04:58.760
Reagan took office in 1981 and his FCC oversaw a complete overhaul of all these regulations,

04:58.760 --> 05:03.140
putting the free market in charge of what children could see.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.140
And as we know, Reagan's policies are beyond criticism.

05:06.140 --> 05:11.640
My generation grew up being advertised to every waking moment of their entire lives

05:11.640 --> 05:14.520
and all of us turned out fine.

05:14.520 --> 05:20.760
And that allowed the creation of shows like My Little Pony, G.I. Joe, He-Man,

05:20.760 --> 05:24.760
Mask, which I just remembered now while filming this bit,

05:24.760 --> 05:29.020
and, yes, Silverhawks.

05:29.020 --> 05:32.320
Partly metal, partly regal.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.820
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

05:33.820 --> 05:34.940
I mean the Transformers.

05:34.940 --> 05:40.900
These robots fight every episode and then at the end the status quo is usually restored

05:40.900 --> 05:48.600
and maybe another robot turns up who can show off their amazing new abilities.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.980
And it's in stores now.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.900
And by now, I mean 30 years ago.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.200
Oh my god.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.620
I think the go-to example from this of the episodes I watched is the one called Bot.

05:59.620 --> 06:04.200
Okay, there's this one robot called Bruticus who's like a big, really powerful robot.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.660
He's way bigger than all the others because he's actually made of five smaller Decepticons

06:08.660 --> 06:09.620
and they all team up and go,

06:09.620 --> 06:10.160
BLEH!

06:10.160 --> 06:12.660
He's the most powerful one.

06:12.660 --> 06:16.240
He's just this utter destructive killing machine.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.620
Anyway, in this episode, he gets shot once and completely falls apart.

06:21.620 --> 06:29.160
Destroyed so completely that four of the five robots are just in bits, like, dead.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.620
And there's only one survivor.

06:30.620 --> 06:35.740
So getting completely obliterated and literally scrapped for parts

06:35.740 --> 06:37.500
and the parts get put in other things.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.120
They put the personality component in another robot for a while and, like, it runs off

06:41.120 --> 06:44.460
and there's this really funny shot of it, like, diving through a window.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.100
Anyway, so that can happen, but it's fine.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.760
They just get rebuilt and they're totally okay.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.800
There is no real death in this universe.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.880
That's fine. I'm not asking for a children's show in which there's murder.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.260
It's actually a really effective way of writing a show with a limited cast of characters.

07:01.260 --> 07:05.300
It means that you can have people getting beat up, people get destroyed,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.920
there are fights and people lose badly,

07:07.920 --> 07:11.220
but they can be rebuilt so they can carry on going

07:11.220 --> 07:14.640
so you don't have to continuously be churning out new characters.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.360
It's also quite similar to how kids play with toys.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.720
You know, when you're a kid and one of your toys dies in whatever thing you're playing,

07:20.720 --> 07:24.900
you don't give it, like, a Viking funeral and then, like, you, like, bury it in the ground

07:24.900 --> 07:26.320
because you can't use it anymore.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.400
That's my secret strategy for winning in Warhammer.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.940
I insist on giving every character of mine that gets killed a proper funeral with a eulogy.

07:33.940 --> 07:37.360
After, like, the fifth one, my opponent always surrenders.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.020
They never want to play with me again,

07:39.020 --> 07:43.120
but I like to think it's because I taught them a harsh lesson about the horrors of war.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.540
Basically, Transformers is the kind of story where no one can really die.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.500
Youâyou get blown up, then they put you back together at the end of the episode,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.800
and then you do it all again. It's that kind of show.

07:51.800 --> 07:55.500
It's very comfy and easy to get into a rhythm, and you can watch a hundred episodes of it,

07:55.500 --> 07:59.960
and it's not particularly challenging, but it doesn't have to be.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
It's for kids.

08:00.960 --> 08:08.380
And it's actually quite nice and relaxing to live in a universe where seemingly nobody can die.

08:08.380 --> 08:09.500
Yeah, it's quite nice.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.800
Anyway, in the opening of the Transformers movie, a planet gets destroyed and millions of people die.

08:13.800 --> 08:18.600
...

08:18.600 --> 08:21.260
Yeah, there's aâthere's a bit of a tone difference in the movie.

08:21.260 --> 08:25.520
âª

08:25.520 --> 08:30.560
Like, we see an actual civilization full of people going about their everyday business.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.700
There's even, like, malls and shopping centers.

08:32.720 --> 08:38.640
And then we get to watch them get completely obliterated and devoured by this giant monster.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.820
I don't really remember the movie being that different as a kid.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.560
I remember the show being, like, really cool and kind of violent.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.660
There was lasers and explosions.

08:45.660 --> 08:49.860
But as an adult, the difference is, like, so clear and shocking.

08:49.860 --> 08:54.820
Something is clearly very different from the previously consequence-free cartoon.

08:54.820 --> 09:00.540
IâI mean, the episode where the guy gets blown up into tiny pieces and put back together

09:00.560 --> 09:02.800
is the episode before the movie.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.560
And it's, like, you go right from that to this!

09:05.560 --> 09:08.100
Let's take a moment to talk about Unicron as a character.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.900
Because, as a kid, he was the big bad guy robot of the movie.

09:11.900 --> 09:17.020
But as an adult, I think Unicron represents something, actually stands in for something.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.240
Um...

09:19.160 --> 09:20.280
Nihilism?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.440
Like, the Transformers universe has a god, according to its wiki.

09:23.440 --> 09:28.120
He's called Primus. I think in some continuities, he's literally Cybertron.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.580
And, you know, just hideâpretend to be a planet. It's a robot in disguise!

09:31.580 --> 09:38.580
But, at least in the philosophical sense, Unicron is the closest thing we see in this universe to, like, a god.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.580
Like, it's absolutely gigantic. It's incomprehensibly powerful.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.500
It can destroy entire planets.

09:44.500 --> 09:52.100
But what's interesting about itânot him, itâis it doesn't do it because it's evil or bad.

09:52.100 --> 09:55.140
Maybe they change this in characterization later.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.800
But in the film, it's very clear that it's eating.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.680
This is how it feeds to survive.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.720
It's this almost Lovecraftian thing.

10:03.720 --> 10:08.040
It's so much bigger than us, and all it wants to do is eat.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.720
And we just happen to be food on the planet it's eating.

10:11.720 --> 10:22.440
And its insides are this bizarre and inscrutable seething mass of machines that just crunch andâand jitter and spark.

10:22.440 --> 10:26.120
There was a negative review of the film in the LA Times by Charles Solomon,

10:26.120 --> 10:29.720
which criticized, like, all aspects of the movie. He didn't really like it.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.360
But he singles out Unicron, and I actually wrote this down.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.160
Um...

10:34.520 --> 10:38.520
The great animated villains, like the Wicked Queen in Disney's Snow White,

10:38.520 --> 10:41.720
had motivations as compelling as any live-action character.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.040
Unicron apparently destroys entire worlds because it has nothing else to do.

10:46.040 --> 10:50.840
Now, personally, I think that's a kind of overly mechanistic way of looking at a film,

10:50.840 --> 10:53.400
where you break down what theâwhat the motivation is,

10:53.400 --> 10:56.920
and if the motivation isn't good according to some arbitrary standards, then it's bad.

10:56.920 --> 11:01.720
Like, it's missing the forest for the trees by assuming a character has to be written a certain way to count as good.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.360
For me, this criticism misses the actual terrifying thing about the character,

11:06.360 --> 11:13.400
which is precisely that Unicron devours entire worlds because it has nothing else to do.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.080
There's just something inevitable and huge about it.

11:17.080 --> 11:23.640
It's this reminder that the universe is cold and senseless and will just kill you because it can.

11:24.600 --> 11:31.400
And it's like, oh, I'm more scared of this movie now than when I was a baby.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.800
The character Unicron most directly evokes,

11:33.800 --> 11:36.600
and by evokes I mean ripped off, they definitely just stole it,

11:36.600 --> 11:41.320
is Galactus from the Marvel Comics continuity universe thing.

11:41.400 --> 11:47.560
Look out for him in Phase...12...point...5...movie...103?

11:47.560 --> 11:48.760
Avengers...

11:50.280 --> 11:52.040
The Return of Jafar.

11:52.040 --> 11:56.840
Stan Lee and Jack Kirby came up with Galactus in 1966, way before Unicron.

11:56.840 --> 12:01.480
Unicron's human form has horns that kind of resemble Galactus's headdress thing.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.800
That might not be intentional, but I hope it was,

12:03.800 --> 12:07.000
because the rest of the character was clearly taken from that as well.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.440
Galactus is a invincible, or almost invincible, whatever,

12:10.440 --> 12:13.240
godlike entity that eats planets to survive.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.640
In an interview, Jack Kirby wrote this about Galactus.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.480
Galactus is a sort of god.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.600
He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
And this is kind of what I find interesting about Unicron.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.200
Its life cycle just involves eating whole planets.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.120
It's not got a moral compunction to do it.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.160
It's just trying to survive, and it will genocide you.

12:31.880 --> 12:36.280
Like, that's, like, a different kind of horror to the sorts of evil

12:36.280 --> 12:40.680
that we normally think about in morality plays and children's media and stuff like that.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.440
And Stan Lee said this about him.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.440
Galactus was simply another in a long line of supervillains who we loved creating.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.480
We felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evildoer

12:49.480 --> 12:51.560
who had almost godlike powers.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.960
Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demigod.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.560
But now what would we do with him?

12:55.560 --> 12:59.080
We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.560
There were enough would-be world conquerors in the Marvel Universe

13:01.560 --> 13:03.800
and in all the other comic book galaxies.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.400
That was when inspiration struck.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.120
Why not have him not be a really evil person?

13:08.120 --> 13:11.720
After all, a demigod should be beyond mere good and evil.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.760
He'd just be, don't laugh, hungry.

13:14.760 --> 13:19.080
And the nourishment he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.920
Now, the phrase,

13:20.920 --> 13:22.920
beyond mere good and evil,

13:22.920 --> 13:24.440
really sticks out to me here?

13:24.440 --> 13:27.080
Not just because it's the name of a book by Friedrich Nietzsche,

13:27.080 --> 13:30.280
like a work of philosophical aphorisms that are all about

13:30.280 --> 13:34.520
dealing specifically with how we build the morality in the wake

13:34.520 --> 13:37.320
of the discovery that our previous assumptions,

13:37.320 --> 13:40.520
like that there was a god who guaranteed good and evil,

13:41.320 --> 13:42.360
just didn't exist.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.400
Like, boiling it down,

13:43.400 --> 13:48.200
it's a book about how to build a philosophy in the wake of there not being a god.

13:48.200 --> 13:52.200
Like, the exact themes that are being presented in this film.

13:52.200 --> 13:57.720
But also because that same phrase is repeated again in the tagline of this movie.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.760
It's even in the trailer.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.440
Unicron, like Galactus, is really compelling

14:08.440 --> 14:11.240
because, in its own cartoonish, for kids-y way,

14:11.960 --> 14:15.400
it's dealing with actual moral and philosophical questions

14:15.400 --> 14:18.040
about how we live in the universe?

14:18.040 --> 14:22.200
Like, its very existence, its incursion into this ideological universe,

14:22.760 --> 14:24.920
is this statement.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.840
There is no divine plan,

14:26.840 --> 14:28.200
you are all going to die,

14:28.840 --> 14:30.200
you are tiny,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.240
and the universe is gonna eat you.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.200
The sort of,

14:34.200 --> 14:37.800
ooh, I want Energon to fight a war so I can be in charge,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.240
evil of Megatron,

14:39.240 --> 14:41.960
is utterly fucking dwarfed

14:42.680 --> 14:46.680
by the magnificent horror of this awful thing.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.440
I even feel bad calling Unicron awful,

14:48.440 --> 14:50.280
it's just, it just is.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.840
Basically, Unicron is an absolutely awesome character,

14:52.840 --> 14:55.320
and I really like it.

14:55.320 --> 15:00.200
And this tone shift doesn't just involve the deaths of a bunch of never-before-seen alien robots.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.880
In the beginning, Megatron and co. surprise attack an Autobot ship,

15:03.880 --> 15:07.400
and all four of the robots on it, who are characters from the show,

15:07.400 --> 15:08.760
just get murked.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.920
They get Game of Thrones'd,

15:10.920 --> 15:12.920
they just get killed, they die,

15:12.920 --> 15:14.840
and then they take that ship,

15:14.840 --> 15:16.920
and they take it to Autobot City,

15:16.920 --> 15:18.920
and there's another big fight,

15:19.480 --> 15:22.120
and, like, a bunch of them die.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.360
The wiki has a special article just for it,

15:24.360 --> 15:26.200
it's the Battle of Autobot City.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.800
And there's just, like, a list of all the characters who died

15:29.800 --> 15:32.120
in the first, like, ten minutes of this movie.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.280
Prowl's death is especially shocking,

15:34.280 --> 15:38.680
like, you see smoke emerge from his mouth and eyes and face

15:38.680 --> 15:40.600
as he goes out, he's just dead.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.400
This is a character from a show that you spent two seasons going,

15:43.400 --> 15:45.640
well, it's okay, they get put back together, it's fine,

15:46.280 --> 15:47.800
and he's just dead.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.680
Megatron repeatedly shoots Optimus Prime in the chest,

15:50.680 --> 15:53.240
and Prime haymakers him off the top of a building,

15:53.240 --> 15:55.640
and he falls, like, multiple stories to the ground.

15:55.640 --> 15:59.240
And they're both, like, fatally wounded and have to be dragged to safety.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.800
And it's not like the show, where they get put back together,

16:01.800 --> 16:02.600
Optimus Prime...

16:03.960 --> 16:04.920
dies.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.000
In the next scene, he gets this, like, deathbed goodbye.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.840
And you watch the light fade from his eyes.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.840
It's worth talking about why this was happening.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.080
Hasbro were making some changes to the toy line,

16:17.080 --> 16:18.360
and they thought, well, in the movie,

16:19.080 --> 16:22.360
get rid of the old characters and introduce the new ones.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.000
And there is something, like, still, even to me now,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.840
genuinely quite sad about this scene,

16:26.840 --> 16:28.600
especially after having just watched the show.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.400
We had two seasons of silly cartoon fights of Megatron,

16:31.400 --> 16:33.320
and this time they just murdered each other?

16:33.320 --> 16:35.640
The father figure of the show is just gone,

16:35.640 --> 16:38.200
and there isn't really anyone left to take his place.

16:38.840 --> 16:43.000
And, like, that's really sad.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.320
And this obviously had a massive impact on its audience.

16:45.320 --> 16:49.000
Like, kids were crying in the theater and had to be dragged out.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.600
There were tons of complaints.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.560
Flint Dill has gone on the record as saying that, like,

16:53.560 --> 16:56.840
he didn't really think it would have this kind of impact.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.640
I'll get somebody saying,

16:57.640 --> 16:59.400
how come you killed Optimus Prime?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.320
I cried when you killed Optimus Prime.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.640
But the real answer is that we, you know,

17:03.640 --> 17:05.800
we didn't know that he was an icon.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.240
As be- it was a toy show.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.640
We just thought we were killing off the old product line,

17:09.640 --> 17:10.920
introducing a new product.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.400
And, you know, Optimus Prime was one of those guys.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.040
They didn't think that they created, like, a cultural icon,

17:16.760 --> 17:19.000
and, in a way,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.160
I don't think they had created such an icon until they killed him.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.040
And what makes it so impactful isn't just that people know the character.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.520
If you had a scene like that for a character no one knew about,

17:28.520 --> 17:29.800
it wouldn't be that interesting.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.320
It's the specific juxtaposition of this

17:33.320 --> 17:34.760
with the kind of immortal,

17:34.760 --> 17:37.800
everything's fine, don't worry about it, nature of the show.

17:37.800 --> 17:42.440
It just invented death in a universe where previously that couldn't happen,

17:42.440 --> 17:46.920
and for a kid that's way, way more shocking than something you know just dying.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.600
It's that specific contrast.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.320
And I think this specifically is what makes the movie interesting,

17:51.320 --> 17:55.080
and makes the movie and the show by relation

17:55.080 --> 17:57.560
such a memorable pop cultural artifact.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.240
It's this specific change they made,

18:01.240 --> 18:03.480
which they didn't have to in the movie.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.400
Like, in the show, as we explored, the story didn't really matter.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.840
No one blinked an eye when everyone was dead for four million years.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.280
Sometimes Megatron can fly.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.360
Doesn't matter. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.000
All of a sudden, you do have to worry about it.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.240
People can die now,

18:19.240 --> 18:23.480
and that, to, like, a kid, is, like, a giant punch in the face.

18:24.040 --> 18:28.120
It's like, oh god, there's a real world out there with consequences,

18:28.120 --> 18:29.400
and I have to live in it.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.400
For me, the introduction of Galactus and the death of Optimus Prime

18:33.560 --> 18:37.000
are the actual beginning of the story of Transformers.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.840
There are actual real big problems,

18:38.840 --> 18:41.800
and not just these silly cartoony villains that you have to face.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.560
There's this existential dread you have to somehow deal with,

18:45.560 --> 18:51.480
and the people you look up to can go and just be gone,

18:51.480 --> 18:54.520
and you might have to take their place,

18:54.520 --> 18:57.640
or learn to make do in a world without them.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.240
And how do you deal with that?

18:59.960 --> 19:04.200
And all of a sudden, this silly show about space robots

19:05.240 --> 19:07.480
has a meaningful story.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.280
And I think that's why I find the Transformers movie so interesting,

19:10.280 --> 19:12.360
and why I wanted to go back and think about it.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.440
I didn't get a pet until I was a bit older,

19:14.440 --> 19:18.680
so for me, like, the first time something that I knew about

19:18.680 --> 19:23.000
and was kind of close to me died was the cartoon robot dad,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.480
and the narrative of the movie actually explores

19:25.480 --> 19:27.800
these really interesting questions and ideas

19:27.800 --> 19:31.960
that you wouldn't expect to happen in the Transformers movie.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.840
Questions like, how do you deal with the fact

19:34.840 --> 19:37.640
that your existence is probably meaningless

19:37.640 --> 19:40.680
and everyone you love can and will die?

19:40.680 --> 19:44.040
These are, like, really important and difficult questions

19:44.040 --> 19:47.560
that we as humans have been striving to try and answer

19:47.560 --> 19:50.040
for hundreds if not thousands of years.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.200
Like, that's basically all Friedrich Nietzsche did

19:52.200 --> 19:54.760
until he, like, went mad and hugged a horse and died.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.600
So ideally, the film would, in a perhaps kid-friendly way,

19:58.600 --> 20:01.640
explore and maybe try and find some answers to these questions.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.800
I said ideally there because it doesn't really.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.320
Like, I've bigged this movie up a lot,

20:07.320 --> 20:08.920
set up all the things about it that I like

20:08.920 --> 20:11.880
and the interesting concepts that it kind of almost explores,

20:12.680 --> 20:14.520
but the movie isn't very good.

20:15.160 --> 20:19.160
Like, for all the bits in it that I like or think are really interesting,

20:19.160 --> 20:22.040
there is a lot of bullshit.

20:22.040 --> 20:25.800
There's loads of scenes of characters just faffing about

20:25.800 --> 20:29.320
and saying one-liners that no one ever thought was cool.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.880
Most egregious is the guy who talks really, really fast

20:31.880 --> 20:33.720
because his thing is he moves really fast

20:33.720 --> 20:35.720
and the little one that, like, talks in rhymes.

20:35.720 --> 20:36.920
What about me, Magnus? What about me?

20:36.920 --> 20:38.280
Mm-ha, mm-ha, mm-ha. I can help. I want to help.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.000
What about me?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.080
Friend, fine. Look behind.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.480
You go wrong way. You fool, I say.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.520
Absolutely, positively, definitely.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.720
Nobody can get this job done faster than I can.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.680
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.640
I've gone out of my way to not learn their names

20:49.640 --> 20:54.360
because I want their existence to slide from my memory as quickly as possible.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.280
If you think this film is actually good,

20:56.280 --> 20:59.080
it's because you forgot about 75% of it.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.720
But the 25% of stuff that's decent,

21:01.720 --> 21:04.840
it actually deals with some really interesting stuff sometimes.

21:04.840 --> 21:08.920
One scene I really quite like is when Unicron eats two of Cybertron's moons

21:08.920 --> 21:13.240
and Bumblebee sets a bomb to detonate while it's being eaten by Unicron and they escape

21:13.800 --> 21:17.960
and then it just isn't affected by the explosion at all

21:17.960 --> 21:22.120
and they get sucked into Unicron and eaten and they're just gone for the rest of the movie

21:22.120 --> 21:25.320
and you only found out that they didn't die, like, right at the end.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.680
It isn't even dented!

21:27.240 --> 21:29.480
Oh, shit! What are we gonna do now?

21:29.480 --> 21:32.120
They actually said a swear in the children's film.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.600
That's how bad things have got for the main characters.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.240
I actually find this really compelling even as an adult.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.120
Watching the characters see this horrible thing coming

21:40.120 --> 21:43.880
and try to formulate a way of attacking it and getting away

21:43.880 --> 21:48.280
and watching it just fail utterly and watch them get sucked in anyway,

21:48.280 --> 21:50.120
it's, like, really cool.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.880
And I think there's an important thematic thing there,

21:51.880 --> 21:55.240
like, the characters are coping with the death of a lot of their friends

21:55.240 --> 21:58.200
and even their leader, like, someone tremendously important to them,

21:59.160 --> 22:04.920
and Unicron, if it represents nihilism or this understanding that life is meaningless,

22:04.920 --> 22:07.720
in a really direct, literalized way,

22:07.720 --> 22:12.360
the characters are trying to deal with and fail to deal with

22:12.840 --> 22:18.680
this gnawing emptiness that tells them that life is pain.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.040
And the whole movie is really about trying to escape the pull of these feelings

22:22.040 --> 22:24.360
and do something with your life,

22:24.360 --> 22:26.520
even though you know that at the end of it you die

22:26.520 --> 22:29.400
and maybe all things don't really matter.

22:30.200 --> 22:35.320
Like, theâtheâthe ultimate question of the film, basically,

22:35.320 --> 22:39.480
is, oh, shit, what do we do now?

22:39.480 --> 22:41.800
Like, even as an adult, I was kind of sucked in.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.400
Like, what's gonna happen?

22:43.400 --> 22:46.520
And the answer isâ¦ a lot of garbage.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.960
âNice, dino, good dino, sweet dino,

22:47.960 --> 22:48.980
won't you step into the night spaceship,

22:48.980 --> 22:50.520
and blow up pretty, please, pretty, pretty, pretty, please, nice dino.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.540
âI'm trying to get them to the shuttle,

22:51.560 --> 22:52.000
what's so magical?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.640
âI'm gonna get on the dino, get on the dino, get on the dino!

22:53.640 --> 22:55.400
âOh, they're gonna mess about for a bit now,

22:56.040 --> 22:57.640
Galvatron'll fly past and go,

22:58.280 --> 22:59.480
ooh,

22:59.480 --> 23:02.120
I'll get you.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.240
Skrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.920
But I think we've established pretty successfully

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
what the questions of the movie are,

23:06.920 --> 23:10.920
and that makes the scenes that are actually about that kind of cool

23:10.920 --> 23:12.760
and interesting and cute

23:12.760 --> 23:16.120
and stand out against the rubbish of the rest of the film.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.840
There's a bit where Cup is telling this, like, old war story to the dinobots,

23:20.840 --> 23:22.600
and they're all sitting around and listening,

23:22.600 --> 23:23.560
and even Hot Rod's like,

23:24.360 --> 23:25.640
why are you doing this?

23:25.640 --> 23:26.680
What's the point of this?

23:26.680 --> 23:27.640
We've got stuff to do.

23:27.640 --> 23:32.040
And I find that scene actually really heartwarming and interesting.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.760
Like, in the middle of this emotionally fraught situation

23:34.760 --> 23:37.240
where bad stuff is happening and danger is present,

23:37.240 --> 23:40.440
the character with the most knowledge and experience sits down and says,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.600
let me tell you about another time it was bad.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.520
And you realize, oh, wow,

23:44.520 --> 23:47.320
when this movie's not just messing about,

23:47.320 --> 23:49.240
it's actually just making a point here

23:49.240 --> 23:52.760
about how, like, telling stories about other times when things were bad

23:52.760 --> 23:55.640
helps us remember that things aren't actually bad all the time,

23:55.640 --> 23:57.800
and there's lots of really good times

23:57.800 --> 23:59.960
where life seems like it's worth living,

23:59.960 --> 24:01.720
even if it ultimately isn't.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.920
And you're like, oh.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.880
There's, like, an interesting point here,

24:05.880 --> 24:08.280
and it takes place in a scene

24:08.280 --> 24:13.240
where a giant robot soldier is telling a bedtime story to a bunch of dinosaurs.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.360
Like, in the context of the movie,

24:14.360 --> 24:17.160
Unicron is really afraid of the Matrix of Leadership for some reason.

24:17.160 --> 24:20.840
Like, it's the only thing that poses a threat to it.

24:20.840 --> 24:26.440
And it's clear here what the Matrix of Leadership actually is.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.680
It's all the stuff that the Autobots are doing to continue carrying on,

24:30.680 --> 24:33.800
even when it seems pointless and like they can't win.

24:33.800 --> 24:38.040
It's all the little things that actually constitute a morality.

24:38.040 --> 24:42.200
That stuff is what allows the Autobots to carry on,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.920
even when all of this bad stuff has happened.

24:44.920 --> 24:48.360
And there's the specific thing that it's called the Matrix of Leadership,

24:48.360 --> 24:52.040
and that begs the question of, like, what is leadership?

24:52.040 --> 24:56.680
What was the je ne sais quoi that made Optimus Prime the cool guy?

24:56.680 --> 24:58.600
And that's being explored here

24:58.600 --> 25:01.080
in how the characters deal with this tough situation.

25:01.080 --> 25:05.160
And what I find really interesting is that the guy who's picked as Prime's successor

25:05.240 --> 25:11.400
is objectively really bad at the specific things required of leadership.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.720
Like, Ultra Magnus even says in the scene, he's like,

25:13.720 --> 25:19.480
But Prime, I'mâI'm just a soldier. IâI'm not worthy.

25:19.480 --> 25:22.360
I am not a good successor to you.

25:22.360 --> 25:26.200
I'm just a guy who's good at the thing that he does.

25:26.200 --> 25:31.160
And he's right. Like, Ultra Magnus makes leadership decisions in the movie,

25:31.160 --> 25:34.760
and they always are basically just concessions

25:34.760 --> 25:37.800
to the Decepticons that actually make the situation worse.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.960
Like, he pulls this clever trick where he lets most of his ship be blown up

25:41.960 --> 25:45.160
so that, like, a little bit of it with them on it can escape,

25:45.160 --> 25:49.560
and that buys them, like, five minutes of time in the movie.

25:49.560 --> 25:54.040
And then after that, he creates a diversion so that the rest of his pals can escape,

25:54.040 --> 25:58.280
which gives him and the Matrix to Galvatron.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.120
Basically, justâhe just loses.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.880
He's just the highest-ranking guy.

26:01.880 --> 26:05.720
He's not a conceptual leader-type figure.

26:05.720 --> 26:10.680
He's not actually good at making the kind of high-concept decisions

26:10.680 --> 26:13.560
a leader should make, whatever those may be.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.080
I wonder if there's an answer to that question explored by the end of the story.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.240
So that begs the ultimate questions.

26:19.240 --> 26:23.640
What actually is leadership if it's not just being in charge?

26:23.640 --> 26:26.440
And how do we make all of this work?

26:26.440 --> 26:31.960
How do we make a positive change in a universe where it often seems hopeless?

26:31.960 --> 26:34.360
And this gets explored on the other ship,

26:34.360 --> 26:37.080
which also crash-lands, but on a different planet.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.480
The one with Hot Rod and Cup and the Dinobots on it.

26:39.480 --> 26:45.240
So they encounter these piranha-like, Transformer-ish robots,

26:45.240 --> 26:46.280
and Cup's like,

26:46.280 --> 26:47.560
We shouldn't fight them.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.920
Let's do the universal greeting.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.200
Don't act hostile.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.440
I'll use the universal greeting.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.280
Universal greeting?

26:56.280 --> 26:57.160
Oh, we're going with this?

26:57.160 --> 27:01.080
Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.640
Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.

27:03.640 --> 27:07.800
What I find interesting about this is the sheer friction

27:07.800 --> 27:12.440
between the concept being explored and the way it's being explored.

27:12.440 --> 27:16.840
Like, the idea of, in this vast universe with multiple different languages

27:16.840 --> 27:19.640
and levels of intellect and consciousness,

27:19.640 --> 27:22.920
the idea that there is a universal phrase

27:22.920 --> 27:26.520
which to anyone means vaguely,

27:26.520 --> 27:28.360
Hi, I'm your friend,

27:28.360 --> 27:30.120
is, like, super fascinating.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.560
Like, the idea of a universe where there is this central,

27:33.560 --> 27:36.360
conceptual meaning and a way of communicating,

27:36.360 --> 27:37.800
like, that's a thing.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.240
And it's being explored by the robot saying,

27:44.520 --> 27:46.760
Weep-a-boop-a-baaah.

27:46.760 --> 27:51.320
Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.600
See? The universal greeting works every time.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.360
Bah-weep-boop-

27:56.360 --> 27:58.280
I can't even be bothered to remember it.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.000
It's so embarrassing and obnoxious,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.080
and it just still makes me cringe.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.000
And even as a kid, I was like,

28:05.000 --> 28:08.040
Oh, no, I hope no one's watching me watching this.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.760
I just, oh, God.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.920
And it doesn't even work either.

28:12.920 --> 28:16.600
They give them the candy, the laser candy,

28:16.600 --> 28:19.560
and they run out and they just capture them anyway.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.280
It doesn't work.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.640
And this is another, like, cool way

28:21.640 --> 28:24.280
that they juxtapose the reality of the story

28:24.280 --> 28:26.520
with the kind of silliness of the cartoon.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.520
They're like, no, this is real.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.360
That childish nonsense doesn't work here.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.320
You've got to be realistic.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.920
You should have slaughtered those other sentient beings.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.120
So they escape, they get on a ship,

28:36.120 --> 28:38.280
and they go to pick up the other Autobots, right?

28:38.840 --> 28:41.960
And then they have a repeat

28:41.960 --> 28:43.640
of the last encounter they just had.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.880
Like, they meet this new alien species

28:45.880 --> 28:47.480
that might be possibly hostile,

28:48.120 --> 28:50.600
and this time Kup's like,

28:50.600 --> 28:51.640
let's just fucking shoot them.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.680
We got them.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.960
And then we get the point of the movie.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.080
We get the moral core, the thesis of the film,

28:59.080 --> 29:03.320
and it is simultaneously the silliest thing ever,

29:03.320 --> 29:08.120
the worst, stupidest, most baddest scene ever,

29:08.120 --> 29:11.000
and also amazing.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.240
So Kup's gonna shoot them, right?

29:13.240 --> 29:14.440
And Hot Rod goes,

29:14.440 --> 29:17.560
no, I've discovered the moral core of the movie.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.080
Let's do the universal greeting again.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.240
What was that universal greeting again?

29:23.240 --> 29:24.440
Never mind, I remember.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.600
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.320
And they do it.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.680
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.200
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

29:38.200 --> 29:38.920
And it works.

29:38.920 --> 29:45.080
Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.520
And everyone's happy,

29:46.520 --> 29:49.320
and they form like a circle around them,

29:49.320 --> 29:50.840
and they do a big dance,

29:50.840 --> 29:52.440
and everyone's their friend.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.560
And then you're like, oh shit,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.200
the movie's actually making a point here

29:57.080 --> 29:59.000
with this incredibly childish thing.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.800
The point is the childishness.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.960
Like, the movie has just positioned

30:04.920 --> 30:09.400
the naive and childish desire

30:09.400 --> 30:12.200
to try to make friends in spite of everything

30:12.920 --> 30:18.760
as the actual radical positive moral choice

30:18.760 --> 30:20.360
to save the universe.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.960
Where you try the thing,

30:21.960 --> 30:23.480
even though the world has told you

30:23.480 --> 30:24.920
it won't work and it'll be bad,

30:25.480 --> 30:27.080
just in case it might.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.080
Just in case you might actually be able

30:29.080 --> 30:30.600
to unite with these other people.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.480
And sometimes it works.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.400
Despite appearing on the surface

30:35.400 --> 30:37.320
to be a deeply cynical movie,

30:37.320 --> 30:38.920
what it's actually doing is setting up

30:38.920 --> 30:40.760
all the really good reasons

30:40.760 --> 30:43.000
that you should be cynical about the world

30:43.000 --> 30:44.120
and your place in it,

30:44.120 --> 30:45.240
and then saying,

30:45.240 --> 30:47.400
no, it's actually really good

30:47.400 --> 30:49.240
to be a bit naive sometimes.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.680
And maybe that's the thing.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.280
Maybe that's the miraculous way

30:52.280 --> 30:54.440
that we build a morality in this universe.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.760
We, perhaps in a somewhat silly way,

30:56.760 --> 30:59.320
assert that this does matter

30:59.320 --> 31:00.600
and everything can work,

31:00.600 --> 31:02.040
even if it doesn't seem like it.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.720
And this is the film answering the question

31:03.720 --> 31:04.920
of what is leadership.

31:04.920 --> 31:05.640
Hot Rods goes,

31:05.640 --> 31:07.960
no, let's not do the tactically clever thing.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.960
Let's be unrealistic.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.560
Let's believe that a peaceful,

31:11.560 --> 31:14.360
mutually beneficial outcome is possible,

31:14.360 --> 31:16.040
and we can actually all get on

31:16.040 --> 31:18.040
and have this peaceful encounter.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.440
And it seems like an unrealistic and silly thing,

31:20.440 --> 31:23.240
but someone there asserting

31:23.240 --> 31:24.760
that they believe it is possible

31:25.320 --> 31:26.760
causes it to happen.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.080
And that is an actual philosophical statement

31:31.080 --> 31:32.760
about how to live in the world,

31:32.760 --> 31:35.160
to insist, if not demand,

31:35.800 --> 31:38.120
that better things are possible,

31:38.120 --> 31:41.560
even when it specifically doesn't seem possible at all.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.840
Literally this scene,

31:42.840 --> 31:44.760
where all of a sudden

31:44.760 --> 31:47.720
there's an answer to the darkness of the universe,

31:47.720 --> 31:49.480
the song that plays over the scene

31:49.480 --> 31:52.200
is Weird Al Yankovic's Dare to be Stupid.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.080
["Dare to be Stupid"]

31:55.080 --> 31:57.640
And that's literally the moral core of the film.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.960
You have to dare to be stupid.

31:59.960 --> 32:04.120
You have to believe in the incredibly silly, idyllic thing.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.560
Ultra Magnus and the other robots

32:05.560 --> 32:07.880
immediately get, like, forlorn,

32:07.880 --> 32:09.720
and they want to be cynical again,

32:09.720 --> 32:10.360
and Hunter says,

32:10.360 --> 32:12.360
no, don't think about it in terms of

32:12.360 --> 32:14.040
whether or not we have the MacGuffin.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.720
Think about it in terms of

32:15.720 --> 32:18.360
what we can do now to make it work.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.800
You know, there's this old thing

32:19.800 --> 32:21.320
that a philosopher guy said once.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.040
A leader isn't someone who tells you what to do

32:26.040 --> 32:29.640
and you obey because he's in a position of power over you.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.800
A leader is someone who talks

32:31.800 --> 32:34.440
and then you realize you believe them

32:34.440 --> 32:36.200
and you want that thing to happen as well.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.800
And that great philosopher's name was Optimus Prime,

32:39.800 --> 32:42.120
and I find this sort of positivity

32:42.120 --> 32:43.960
radically reshapes the universe thing

32:45.080 --> 32:46.680
happening as well with Unicron.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.840
Like, Galvatron tries to use the Matrix

32:49.480 --> 32:51.320
and he doesn't really know how to understand it,

32:51.320 --> 32:53.320
but he does use it in some capacity

32:53.320 --> 32:56.120
because it suddenly causes Unicron

32:56.120 --> 32:58.520
to transform and unfold

32:58.520 --> 33:00.520
and you actually get the coolest scene in the movie,

33:00.520 --> 33:02.440
this really awesome transformation sequence

33:02.440 --> 33:05.000
where he unfolds and moves and shifts

33:05.000 --> 33:08.040
and it's got some of the best music ever.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.280
Like, I've listened to the Unicron theme medley

33:10.280 --> 33:14.920
like 1,500 times in my life over the last decade.

33:14.920 --> 33:15.880
It's just incredible.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.320
Just Unicron's theme in general

33:17.320 --> 33:19.000
is just this epic thing

33:19.000 --> 33:21.960
where it's a mix of synthesizers and drums

33:21.960 --> 33:25.880
and there's like this industrial hissing

33:25.880 --> 33:26.360
and it's just...

33:27.320 --> 33:30.520
I realize that almost all of my musical interests

33:30.520 --> 33:32.360
spring forth in some fashion

33:32.360 --> 33:35.240
from the soundscape of the various iterations

33:35.240 --> 33:37.000
of the Unicron theme in the movie.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.600
It's also, like, really, really cool

33:38.600 --> 33:40.200
that the best scene in the movie

33:40.200 --> 33:43.640
is literally just a scene of something transforming.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.840
It's just, this is literally the film

33:46.840 --> 33:49.320
and it's really cool. I love it.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.080
But this scene is also a continuation

33:51.080 --> 33:52.440
of the themes of the story.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.240
Like, we've just seen that the assertion

33:55.240 --> 33:57.080
that things can be made better

33:57.080 --> 33:58.840
allows the impossible to happen.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.000
People who would have been your enemies

34:01.000 --> 34:02.200
if you'd approached them differently

34:02.200 --> 34:03.320
are suddenly your friends

34:03.960 --> 34:06.760
and with the mere application of the belief

34:06.760 --> 34:09.080
that something can be done about Unicron,

34:09.880 --> 34:13.000
all of a sudden Unicron becomes a comprehensible threat.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.880
Unicron becomes mortal in response to Galvatron

34:17.880 --> 34:20.200
trying to use the Matrix against him

34:20.200 --> 34:22.120
and I find that super interesting.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.880
Like, that's literally the themes of the film.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.800
If you believe something can be done,

34:25.800 --> 34:27.640
all of a sudden maybe it actually can be.

34:27.640 --> 34:29.640
So Hot Rod crashes his ship

34:29.640 --> 34:31.400
right through Unicron's eye

34:32.200 --> 34:33.240
and, like, all of a sudden

34:33.240 --> 34:36.440
this basically god-like creature

34:36.440 --> 34:39.720
that eats planets and can't be harmed

34:39.720 --> 34:42.360
by massive moon-sized explosions

34:42.360 --> 34:43.400
and can suck people in

34:43.400 --> 34:44.440
even when they're trying to escape,

34:44.440 --> 34:46.200
all of a sudden he's, like, gasping in pain.

34:46.200 --> 34:46.520
He goes,

34:46.520 --> 34:47.720
"[screams in pain, laughs evilly"]

34:47.720 --> 34:49.800
And his eye, because it's been smashed apart

34:49.800 --> 34:51.240
and the crash is timed

34:51.240 --> 34:54.040
with the first line of Stan Bush's song,

34:54.040 --> 34:54.360
"'Dare.'"

34:54.360 --> 34:57.160
["Dare!" by Stan Bush plays in the background.]

34:57.160 --> 34:59.000
Where, again, it's the thing about daring, again.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.640
It's, like, daring is, by definition,

35:02.360 --> 35:03.640
believing in something

35:03.640 --> 35:06.200
which it's not realistic to believe.

35:06.200 --> 35:10.040
And this isn't just a ridiculous 80s rock anthem

35:10.040 --> 35:11.720
about generic positivity

35:11.720 --> 35:13.960
playing over a toy commercial film.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.000
I mean, it is that,

35:16.040 --> 35:17.240
but in addition,

35:17.240 --> 35:20.040
it's a really interesting declaration

35:20.120 --> 35:24.760
that doing the supposedly clever thing,

35:24.760 --> 35:26.360
the realistic thing,

35:26.360 --> 35:27.800
isn't really enough.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.200
Sometimes you have to demand the impossible.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.040
One last scene that I really, really like

35:32.040 --> 35:34.200
is the bit between Galvatron and Hot Rod

35:34.200 --> 35:35.080
when they're fighting

35:35.080 --> 35:36.360
and Galvatron's like,

35:36.360 --> 35:38.200
"'We should probably just come out and be killed by me.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.200
I mean, we're all gonna die, right?'

35:40.200 --> 35:41.640
["Come out, Autobot!

35:42.520 --> 35:44.920
We all must die sometime!"

35:44.920 --> 35:45.720
And Hot Rod goes,

35:46.600 --> 35:47.320
"'No!'

35:47.320 --> 35:48.520
and punches him.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.120
"'Not today, Galvatron!'

35:51.560 --> 35:53.960
And that exchange sums up the whole movie.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.840
You know, the universe is dark and scary,

35:56.840 --> 35:58.520
and maybe your life is meaningless,

35:58.520 --> 36:01.240
and maybe we're all just sitting around waiting to die.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.880
We're all just running out the biological clock,

36:03.880 --> 36:05.560
but we're not gonna die today,

36:06.600 --> 36:08.360
and things can be made better.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.600
And this approach is what causes the Matrix

36:10.600 --> 36:13.960
to finally activate and get all glowy and stuff,

36:13.960 --> 36:14.440
and he's like,

36:14.440 --> 36:15.640
"'I have the power!'

36:15.640 --> 36:16.680
That's a different show.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.800
I know it's a different show.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.640
I was making a reference.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.960
Stan Bush's The Touch starts playing,

36:21.960 --> 36:23.480
and he gets all glowy,

36:23.480 --> 36:25.320
and he transforms.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.080
He evolves, and he doesn't hit B,

36:27.080 --> 36:28.040
so it's permanent,

36:28.040 --> 36:29.320
and he transforms into...

36:31.480 --> 36:32.840
Rodimus Prime.

36:32.840 --> 36:37.000
["Arise, Rodimus Prime!"

36:37.000 --> 36:39.480
["Optimus!"

36:40.920 --> 36:43.240
Come on, you almost let me use you

36:43.240 --> 36:45.160
to make a really interesting point movie,

36:45.160 --> 36:48.760
and then the main character's apotheosis

36:48.760 --> 36:52.680
is to transform into someone called Rodimus Prime.

36:52.680 --> 36:56.680
He's just, oh, there's a reason no one's taken this movie seriously

36:56.680 --> 36:58.440
for 30 years.

36:59.560 --> 37:00.360
Oh!"

37:00.360 --> 37:01.320
And then he holds up the Matrix,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.600
and Unicron explodes.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.760
The power of leadership and hope

37:04.760 --> 37:07.560
and unwarranted positivity in a dark universe

37:07.560 --> 37:11.960
has successfully vanquished the pessimistic nihilism

37:11.960 --> 37:13.320
that encroaches upon us all

37:13.320 --> 37:15.000
when bad things happen in our lives.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.760
Rodimus Prime discovered the magic of Xanax.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.200
Rodimus Prime makes a speech about how, like,

37:22.920 --> 37:25.640
now we're going to live in a world of peace

37:25.640 --> 37:29.080
where everyone can be a part of this beautiful new world.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.640
Just this ridiculously optimistic speech.

37:31.640 --> 37:36.200
["We march forward to a new age of peace and happiness

37:36.200 --> 37:37.800
till all are one!"

37:37.800 --> 37:38.760
And it's like, yeah,

37:38.760 --> 37:40.600
and then Unicron's head flies past,

37:40.600 --> 37:41.160
and that's the end.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.240
It just ends on that speech with the music playing

37:43.240 --> 37:43.960
just like that.

37:43.960 --> 37:44.760
We beat you.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.160
Let's all live in peace and happiness forever.

37:47.160 --> 37:47.720
Done.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.360
Credits.

37:48.360 --> 37:48.760
Go.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.480
Just have a nice day, everyone.

37:51.480 --> 37:51.960
I love it.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.200
So yeah, it's not really that great a movie,

37:54.200 --> 37:55.960
and the scenes that stand out,

37:55.960 --> 37:57.880
especially to the kids who remembered it

37:57.880 --> 37:59.960
from the time they first saw it,

37:59.960 --> 38:03.880
they stand out usually because it was busy killing

38:04.680 --> 38:07.720
a character that was well-known and important to you.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.200
Like, it wasn't impactful because it was good.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.280
It was impactful because it was horrifying

38:12.840 --> 38:16.040
in, like, a really terrible way for a kid.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.440
It didn't really stand out because of its quality.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.080
Like, I find that I keep every couple of years

38:21.080 --> 38:23.480
coming back to this movie in some form.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.360
This movie is unmistakably a kind of standard

38:26.360 --> 38:29.720
hero's journey transition into adulthood thing for Hot Rod.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.200
Growing up, I appreciate that far more

38:32.200 --> 38:34.840
because, like, I and a lot of the kids who watch this movie

38:34.840 --> 38:36.360
have had to mature into adults

38:36.360 --> 38:38.680
and encounter some of the emotions

38:38.680 --> 38:41.400
that were first brought up for some kids in this film.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.800
A lot of people have had to deal with the death of a parent

38:43.800 --> 38:48.120
or someone really close to them and learn to cope with that.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.200
And it's hard not to, in that process,

38:52.200 --> 38:54.520
look back on a movie that is kind of about

38:54.520 --> 38:55.640
dealing with those things.

38:56.360 --> 38:58.040
Like, in a way, the Transformers movie

38:58.040 --> 39:01.000
is more meaningful to adults now

39:01.000 --> 39:03.720
than it ever could have been for kids then.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.960
I think I find myself coming back to this movie

39:05.960 --> 39:10.040
because I never feel like I'm quite done thinking about it

39:10.040 --> 39:12.280
because its meaning keeps changing for me

39:12.920 --> 39:15.560
as I keep changing as a person.

39:15.560 --> 39:19.640
I, as a person, have grown up and changed a lot

39:19.640 --> 39:23.240
in the last 10, 15, 20 years of my life.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.840
A lot of things in the world have changed

39:26.840 --> 39:31.800
and, in a way, one of the ways that you learn to deal with it

39:31.800 --> 39:33.320
and fully appreciate those things

39:33.320 --> 39:35.800
is you go back to something that you felt you knew

39:36.360 --> 39:42.840
and look at it with the benefit of the new site that you have.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.040
And I find that I keep doing this

39:44.040 --> 39:45.880
with the Transformers movie in particular.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.680
Like, five years ago, when I was just really into

39:48.680 --> 39:49.880
how clever I thought I was,

39:49.880 --> 39:53.480
I used to write for this website called smugfilm.com.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.840
Like, that was supposed to be a joke.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.160
Like, haha, we know how silly this looks.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.560
But really, no, everyone on that site was pretty smug,

39:59.560 --> 40:00.520
especially me.

40:00.520 --> 40:04.280
And five years ago now, in 2014,

40:05.560 --> 40:09.160
I wrote a piece about how the Transformers movie

40:09.160 --> 40:12.360
is actually about the Nietzschean ideal.

40:12.360 --> 40:16.360
How it's this, like, radical rebuttal to philosophical nihilism.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.760
Like, that was incredibly silly.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.000
But there was a time in my life

40:21.000 --> 40:23.960
where I genuinely felt that way about the film

40:24.760 --> 40:28.520
and felt that way about how to think about the world.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.520
And one of the ways that I allowed myself to develop

40:32.520 --> 40:35.880
was by reinvestigating what I had previously thought of

40:35.880 --> 40:38.760
as just this fun movie that I thought was cool when I was a kid.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.360
Like, in a way, it's only through nostalgia

40:43.000 --> 40:44.760
that we understand the present

40:44.760 --> 40:47.640
by fully accepting how we used to see something.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.000
Don't read that article, by the way.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.480
It's really not that great.

40:51.480 --> 40:55.240
In fact, I still have some beef with the guy who ran the site.

40:55.240 --> 40:59.240
He would edit the articles to be what he thought sounded better

40:59.240 --> 41:01.000
and he would cut a bunch of the words out.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.200
Like, I remember my original article being, like, twice as long

41:04.200 --> 41:07.480
and he, like, cut out all my favorite bits and reworded some of it

41:07.480 --> 41:09.800
and it just, I don't know, it just kind of annoyed me.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.920
Don't read the old article, anyway.

41:10.920 --> 41:11.880
It was bad before.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.240
It was bad before it was edited.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.360
We are all, in a very specific sense,

41:16.360 --> 41:21.960
undergoing this eternal and never truly finished transformation.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.640
We're always becoming something else

41:24.440 --> 41:29.240
and this is one of the ways that we come to understand who we are now

41:29.240 --> 41:35.160
is by looking at the things from our past with the new lens that we have

41:35.160 --> 41:40.120
and, like, that, I think, is the value of nostalgia.

41:40.120 --> 41:44.920
You have the ability to look back not just on something from the past

41:44.920 --> 41:47.400
but on how you were in the past.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.560
I think a lot of people are nostalgic for movies

41:50.200 --> 41:52.440
not because there's something particularly great

41:52.440 --> 41:55.160
about living in the 80s or something

41:55.160 --> 41:57.000
but because being a kid in the 80s

41:57.000 --> 42:00.040
when the worst thing that could possibly happen to you that day

42:00.040 --> 42:02.760
was the cartoon dad robot died.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.280
Like, that is a really nice time to be alive

42:06.280 --> 42:11.560
that we all kind of, on some level, do appreciate more now that we don't have it.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.040
We're coming up on, like, in a couple of months,

42:14.040 --> 42:19.560
the 10-year anniversary of Lindsay Ellis's video about the Transformers movie.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.280
She hates it.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.800
She thinks it's terrible.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.440
Like, 10 years.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.560
I wasn't joking earlier in the video where I talked about how old I felt.

42:27.560 --> 42:33.560
Like, in a way, this video is, like, a very brief midlife crisis for me

42:33.560 --> 42:36.600
where I look back on how I used to think about some stuff

42:36.600 --> 42:39.800
and my old YouTube videos and the things I used to do

42:40.360 --> 42:43.560
and try and figure out where I've changed

42:43.560 --> 42:45.720
and where I'm going and what I'm supposed to do

42:46.360 --> 42:49.800
and I think the reason why I turn back to Transformers

42:49.800 --> 42:52.440
is because it shouts the loudest and clearest,

42:53.080 --> 42:55.560
the most valuable message for someone in that state,

42:55.560 --> 42:59.080
which is demand the impossible.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.600
Believe that it can be better even if it doesn't seem that way

43:02.600 --> 43:06.280
and that's how finding the way out becomes possible

43:06.280 --> 43:10.200
and I guess I never really stopped believing in the silly cartoon.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.480
I just find better and better ways to intellectualize it.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.760
For the first time in my life, I feel old.

43:17.080 --> 43:22.360
I've felt like I was 19 until I was 26

43:23.320 --> 43:25.960
and now I feel like an old person

43:27.320 --> 43:29.560
and it's made me go,

43:30.840 --> 43:33.240
well, who am I?

43:33.240 --> 43:35.640
And looking back on all my old videos, it makes me think,

43:35.640 --> 43:38.440
wow, I thought this was funny

43:39.480 --> 43:43.480
and maybe I miss having that much future ahead of me

43:43.640 --> 43:47.000
but it makes me happy to be who I am now.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.240
It's fun realizing that while the past had its benefits,

43:52.120 --> 43:55.320
the present and the future are pretty cool too.

43:55.320 --> 43:59.080
This movie is a part of my process of thinking about life and the world

43:59.640 --> 44:03.480
so it's been fun using it as an excuse to talk about these ideas now.

44:04.120 --> 44:10.120
So, yeah, thanks for tuning in to my midlife crisis.

44:10.360 --> 44:15.160
It's over now. I feel good again.

44:15.160 --> 44:18.600
Thank you very much to the people who support me doing this

44:18.600 --> 44:22.360
because I literally, literally couldn't be here doing this without you.

44:22.360 --> 44:26.040
So for me now, the Transformers movie is unavoidably

44:26.040 --> 44:28.760
about dealing with having to mature into a world

44:28.760 --> 44:31.160
where no one really knows what's going on

44:31.160 --> 44:33.240
and you have to somehow figure it out for yourself

44:33.240 --> 44:36.200
and that makes the movie interesting to me even now,

44:36.200 --> 44:38.360
even though it's measurably bad.

44:38.360 --> 44:41.960
I guess the movie was more than meets the eye.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.200
Oh my god.
