0	3500	Ah, here I am in my childhood bedroom.
3500	6620	That's what it is. This is what my childhood bedroom was.
6620	10340	Look, I think all that matters is that I had a normal childhood
10340	14340	and my experience is made for hashtag relatable content!
14340	15040	AHH!
15040	17760	Because recently I've been thinking an awful lot about nostalgia.
17760	22340	You're probably wondering, why are you filming on a bed with all of these stuffed toys?
22340	27560	Are you trying to rip off Jenny Nicholson so that you can finally catch up to her in terms of subscribers?
27660	29160	And the answer to that question is...
30120	32200	Yeah. But also, for another reason.
32200	35200	Okay, we're gonna get into some real deep Hbomb lore here.
35200	39160	But for the first... decade of my channel,
39160	43420	it was basically just a place where I posted whatever random videos I thought were funny,
43420	45300	and Let's Plays and stuff like that.
45300	48880	But I also used to do, like, a web series that was making fun of video blogs.
48880	51760	It was just me with a camcorder messing about. It was silly.
51760	56300	In that old video series, I used to have a sequence where I would go to my bed
56300	58100	to answer viewer emails.
58100	60940	And really, it was just a way of using all the jokes that I thought of
60940	63480	that had nothing to do with the rest of the theme of the video.
63480	67900	Basically, it was just a technique used to justify doing something
67900	70820	completely unrelated to what people actually wanted or expected.
71440	72620	And, um...
73240	76160	So I'm using it now for a different reason.
76160	77360	Sitting on these bed...
78200	79200	These bed...
79200	83240	Because sitting on this bed with these ancient sheets from...
83240	87040	1996? 7? I'm guessing?
87460	91740	Makes me feel nostalgic for an earlier point in my life.
91740	94120	And that's what this video is gonna be about.
94120	97380	Speaking of the past, the 1980s were really...
98260	99000	interesting.
99000	102840	I was born in the 90s, so my real love was the stuff I had access to,
102840	107340	like Pokémon and Power Rangers, you know, where they beat up cool monsters
107360	111040	and did fighting and there was explosions and giant robots.
111040	112500	It was a kid's dream.
112500	115700	And the music was so catchy that they've been reusing that same riff
115700	119920	in bits of music for the last, like, 25 years.
120920	122220	Oh, wow.
123000	125260	I've learned how to feel old.
125260	128340	But a secret fascination of mine was the 80s.
128340	130800	To me, they were like the dark times.
130800	135260	This period from before I was born and we had all of these ancient artifacts from it
135260	137520	that only I could make sense of.
137520	141220	The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and He-Man and the Transformers
141220	143300	weren't really for me.
143300	146560	They were for kids from a previous generation.
146560	151800	And luckily for me, thanks to VHS, a format that I've heard someone cool made a video about once,
151800	156220	I could re-watch these ancient stories from the before time over and over
156220	159180	without ever having to develop a personality.
159180	161560	Transformers in particular was really cool.
161600	163860	But then one day in Blockbusters,
163860	166600	and I only realize now how dated this video is going to be,
166600	171100	I saw a copy of a tape for The Transformers The Movie.
171100	173900	And that's weird because I thought movies were for adults and not kids
173900	178320	who watch their favorite stuff at 5 in the morning or however early I used to be able to wake up.
178320	182860	So I forced my dad to rent it and I spent a weekend watching it over and over
182860	188100	and storing all of its images in my brain for the rest of time.
188140	191860	There are some powerful images in that film which will never leave me.
191860	193600	I never learned an instrument.
193600	195100	["Turkish March"]
195100	198680	But in my adolescent and then later adult years,
198680	202600	I noticed that a lot of people my age or slightly older
202600	205480	didn't really remember the show in that much detail
205480	209980	but still remembered a lot of stuff from that movie and they might not have even seen it for decades.
209980	212680	And I've been curious for quite a while about how it ended up that way
212680	217280	so lately I re-watched some of the show and then the movie to try to figure out how to...
218360	220480	Actually, no.
220480	226860	I don't really have a justification for my life choices in such a clear-cut way like that.
226860	231280	To be honest, most of my videos are me hastily writing an introduction and a conclusion
231280	235560	to the bit that I just felt like making for no particular reason
235560	237900	and this time I just don't have one.
237900	242780	I'm going to talk about The Transformers show and the 1986 movie
242780	247960	for an amount of time and you can watch it if you'd like.
249280	251280	I'm gonna make that the thumbnail.
251280	254120	["Turkish March"]
254120	258460	Something I didn't really realize as a kid and probably should have done
258460	262120	is that The Transformers show is basically just a really explicit toy commercial.
262120	265340	I was really curious how a show could come to be like this
265340	269460	so I asked my father, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, how it came to be
269460	272880	and he told me it was all the fault of that capitalist pig dog, Reagan.
272880	277260	Ronald McDonald's Reagan was, of course, president of the United States for most of the 80s
277260	282380	and he famously hated regulation almost as much as he hated South American civilians.
282380	288340	I believe that prior to Reagan, broadcasters weren't allowed to do more than 12 minutes per hour of advertising
288340	293380	and, you know, a show which is basically selling a toy probably would have counted as advertising.
293380	298760	Reagan took office in 1981 and his FCC oversaw a complete overhaul of all these regulations,
298760	303140	putting the free market in charge of what children could see.
303140	306140	And as we know, Reagan's policies are beyond criticism.
306140	311640	My generation grew up being advertised to every waking moment of their entire lives
311640	314520	and all of us turned out fine.
314520	320760	And that allowed the creation of shows like My Little Pony, G.I. Joe, He-Man,
320760	324760	Mask, which I just remembered now while filming this bit,
324760	329020	and, yes, Silverhawks.
329020	332320	Partly metal, partly regal.
332320	333820	Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
333820	334940	I mean the Transformers.
334940	340900	These robots fight every episode and then at the end the status quo is usually restored
340900	348600	and maybe another robot turns up who can show off their amazing new abilities.
348600	350980	And it's in stores now.
351000	353900	And by now, I mean 30 years ago.
353900	355200	Oh my god.
355200	359620	I think the go-to example from this of the episodes I watched is the one called Bot.
359620	364200	Okay, there's this one robot called Bruticus who's like a big, really powerful robot.
364200	368660	He's way bigger than all the others because he's actually made of five smaller Decepticons
368660	369620	and they all team up and go,
369620	370160	BLEH!
370160	372660	He's the most powerful one.
372660	376240	He's just this utter destructive killing machine.
377240	381620	Anyway, in this episode, he gets shot once and completely falls apart.
381620	389160	Destroyed so completely that four of the five robots are just in bits, like, dead.
389160	390620	And there's only one survivor.
390620	395740	So getting completely obliterated and literally scrapped for parts
395740	397500	and the parts get put in other things.
397500	401120	They put the personality component in another robot for a while and, like, it runs off
401120	404460	and there's this really funny shot of it, like, diving through a window.
404500	407100	Anyway, so that can happen, but it's fine.
407100	409760	They just get rebuilt and they're totally okay.
409760	411800	There is no real death in this universe.
411800	414880	That's fine. I'm not asking for a children's show in which there's murder.
417720	421260	It's actually a really effective way of writing a show with a limited cast of characters.
421260	425300	It means that you can have people getting beat up, people get destroyed,
425300	427920	there are fights and people lose badly,
427920	431220	but they can be rebuilt so they can carry on going
431220	434640	so you don't have to continuously be churning out new characters.
434640	437360	It's also quite similar to how kids play with toys.
437360	440720	You know, when you're a kid and one of your toys dies in whatever thing you're playing,
440720	444900	you don't give it, like, a Viking funeral and then, like, you, like, bury it in the ground
444900	446320	because you can't use it anymore.
446320	448400	That's my secret strategy for winning in Warhammer.
448400	453940	I insist on giving every character of mine that gets killed a proper funeral with a eulogy.
453940	457360	After, like, the fifth one, my opponent always surrenders.
457360	459020	They never want to play with me again,
459020	463120	but I like to think it's because I taught them a harsh lesson about the horrors of war.
463120	466540	Basically, Transformers is the kind of story where no one can really die.
466540	469500	You—you get blown up, then they put you back together at the end of the episode,
469500	471800	and then you do it all again. It's that kind of show.
471800	475500	It's very comfy and easy to get into a rhythm, and you can watch a hundred episodes of it,
475500	479960	and it's not particularly challenging, but it doesn't have to be.
479960	480960	It's for kids.
480960	488380	And it's actually quite nice and relaxing to live in a universe where seemingly nobody can die.
488380	489500	Yeah, it's quite nice.
489500	493800	Anyway, in the opening of the Transformers movie, a planet gets destroyed and millions of people die.
493800	498600	...
498600	501260	Yeah, there's a—there's a bit of a tone difference in the movie.
501260	505520	♪
505520	510560	Like, we see an actual civilization full of people going about their everyday business.
510560	512700	There's even, like, malls and shopping centers.
512720	518640	And then we get to watch them get completely obliterated and devoured by this giant monster.
518640	521820	I don't really remember the movie being that different as a kid.
521820	524560	I remember the show being, like, really cool and kind of violent.
524560	525660	There was lasers and explosions.
525660	529860	But as an adult, the difference is, like, so clear and shocking.
529860	534820	Something is clearly very different from the previously consequence-free cartoon.
534820	540540	I—I mean, the episode where the guy gets blown up into tiny pieces and put back together
540560	542800	is the episode before the movie.
542800	545560	And it's, like, you go right from that to this!
545560	548100	Let's take a moment to talk about Unicron as a character.
548100	551900	Because, as a kid, he was the big bad guy robot of the movie.
551900	557020	But as an adult, I think Unicron represents something, actually stands in for something.
557440	558240	Um...
559160	560280	Nihilism?
560280	563440	Like, the Transformers universe has a god, according to its wiki.
563440	568120	He's called Primus. I think in some continuities, he's literally Cybertron.
568280	571580	And, you know, just hide—pretend to be a planet. It's a robot in disguise!
571580	578580	But, at least in the philosophical sense, Unicron is the closest thing we see in this universe to, like, a god.
578580	582580	Like, it's absolutely gigantic. It's incomprehensibly powerful.
582580	584500	It can destroy entire planets.
584500	592100	But what's interesting about it—not him, it—is it doesn't do it because it's evil or bad.
592100	595140	Maybe they change this in characterization later.
595140	597800	But in the film, it's very clear that it's eating.
597800	600680	This is how it feeds to survive.
600680	603720	It's this almost Lovecraftian thing.
603720	608040	It's so much bigger than us, and all it wants to do is eat.
608040	611720	And we just happen to be food on the planet it's eating.
611720	622440	And its insides are this bizarre and inscrutable seething mass of machines that just crunch and—and jitter and spark.
622440	626120	There was a negative review of the film in the LA Times by Charles Solomon,
626120	629720	which criticized, like, all aspects of the movie. He didn't really like it.
629720	632360	But he singles out Unicron, and I actually wrote this down.
632360	633160	Um...
634520	638520	The great animated villains, like the Wicked Queen in Disney's Snow White,
638520	641720	had motivations as compelling as any live-action character.
641720	646040	Unicron apparently destroys entire worlds because it has nothing else to do.
646040	650840	Now, personally, I think that's a kind of overly mechanistic way of looking at a film,
650840	653400	where you break down what the—what the motivation is,
653400	656920	and if the motivation isn't good according to some arbitrary standards, then it's bad.
656920	661720	Like, it's missing the forest for the trees by assuming a character has to be written a certain way to count as good.
661720	666360	For me, this criticism misses the actual terrifying thing about the character,
666360	673400	which is precisely that Unicron devours entire worlds because it has nothing else to do.
673400	677080	There's just something inevitable and huge about it.
677080	683640	It's this reminder that the universe is cold and senseless and will just kill you because it can.
684600	691400	And it's like, oh, I'm more scared of this movie now than when I was a baby.
691400	693800	The character Unicron most directly evokes,
693800	696600	and by evokes I mean ripped off, they definitely just stole it,
696600	701320	is Galactus from the Marvel Comics continuity universe thing.
701400	707560	Look out for him in Phase...12...point...5...movie...103?
707560	708760	Avengers...
710280	712040	The Return of Jafar.
712040	716840	Stan Lee and Jack Kirby came up with Galactus in 1966, way before Unicron.
716840	721480	Unicron's human form has horns that kind of resemble Galactus's headdress thing.
721480	723800	That might not be intentional, but I hope it was,
723800	727000	because the rest of the character was clearly taken from that as well.
727000	730440	Galactus is a invincible, or almost invincible, whatever,
730440	733240	godlike entity that eats planets to survive.
733240	735640	In an interview, Jack Kirby wrote this about Galactus.
735640	737480	Galactus is a sort of god.
737480	740600	He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion.
740600	742600	And this is kind of what I find interesting about Unicron.
742600	746200	Its life cycle just involves eating whole planets.
746200	748120	It's not got a moral compunction to do it.
748120	751160	It's just trying to survive, and it will genocide you.
751880	756280	Like, that's, like, a different kind of horror to the sorts of evil
756280	760680	that we normally think about in morality plays and children's media and stuff like that.
760680	762440	And Stan Lee said this about him.
762440	766440	Galactus was simply another in a long line of supervillains who we loved creating.
766440	769480	We felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evildoer
769480	771560	who had almost godlike powers.
771560	773960	Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demigod.
773960	775560	But now what would we do with him?
775560	779080	We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world.
779080	781560	There were enough would-be world conquerors in the Marvel Universe
781560	783800	and in all the other comic book galaxies.
783800	785400	That was when inspiration struck.
785400	788120	Why not have him not be a really evil person?
788120	791720	After all, a demigod should be beyond mere good and evil.
791720	794760	He'd just be, don't laugh, hungry.
794760	799080	And the nourishment he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets.
799080	800920	Now, the phrase,
800920	802920	beyond mere good and evil,
802920	804440	really sticks out to me here?
804440	807080	Not just because it's the name of a book by Friedrich Nietzsche,
807080	810280	like a work of philosophical aphorisms that are all about
810280	814520	dealing specifically with how we build the morality in the wake
814520	817320	of the discovery that our previous assumptions,
817320	820520	like that there was a god who guaranteed good and evil,
821320	822360	just didn't exist.
822360	823400	Like, boiling it down,
823400	828200	it's a book about how to build a philosophy in the wake of there not being a god.
828200	832200	Like, the exact themes that are being presented in this film.
832200	837720	But also because that same phrase is repeated again in the tagline of this movie.
837720	838760	It's even in the trailer.
845480	848440	Unicron, like Galactus, is really compelling
848440	851240	because, in its own cartoonish, for kids-y way,
851960	855400	it's dealing with actual moral and philosophical questions
855400	858040	about how we live in the universe?
858040	862200	Like, its very existence, its incursion into this ideological universe,
862760	864920	is this statement.
864920	866840	There is no divine plan,
866840	868200	you are all going to die,
868840	870200	you are tiny,
870200	873240	and the universe is gonna eat you.
873240	874200	The sort of,
874200	877800	ooh, I want Energon to fight a war so I can be in charge,
877800	879240	evil of Megatron,
879240	881960	is utterly fucking dwarfed
882680	886680	by the magnificent horror of this awful thing.
886680	888440	I even feel bad calling Unicron awful,
888440	890280	it's just, it just is.
890280	892840	Basically, Unicron is an absolutely awesome character,
892840	895320	and I really like it.
895320	900200	And this tone shift doesn't just involve the deaths of a bunch of never-before-seen alien robots.
900200	903880	In the beginning, Megatron and co. surprise attack an Autobot ship,
903880	907400	and all four of the robots on it, who are characters from the show,
907400	908760	just get murked.
909320	910920	They get Game of Thrones'd,
910920	912920	they just get killed, they die,
912920	914840	and then they take that ship,
914840	916920	and they take it to Autobot City,
916920	918920	and there's another big fight,
919480	922120	and, like, a bunch of them die.
922120	924360	The wiki has a special article just for it,
924360	926200	it's the Battle of Autobot City.
926200	929800	And there's just, like, a list of all the characters who died
929800	932120	in the first, like, ten minutes of this movie.
932120	934280	Prowl's death is especially shocking,
934280	938680	like, you see smoke emerge from his mouth and eyes and face
938680	940600	as he goes out, he's just dead.
940600	943400	This is a character from a show that you spent two seasons going,
943400	945640	well, it's okay, they get put back together, it's fine,
946280	947800	and he's just dead.
947800	950680	Megatron repeatedly shoots Optimus Prime in the chest,
950680	953240	and Prime haymakers him off the top of a building,
953240	955640	and he falls, like, multiple stories to the ground.
955640	959240	And they're both, like, fatally wounded and have to be dragged to safety.
959240	961800	And it's not like the show, where they get put back together,
961800	962600	Optimus Prime...
963960	964920	dies.
964920	969000	In the next scene, he gets this, like, deathbed goodbye.
969240	972840	And you watch the light fade from his eyes.
972840	974840	It's worth talking about why this was happening.
974840	977080	Hasbro were making some changes to the toy line,
977080	978360	and they thought, well, in the movie,
979080	982360	get rid of the old characters and introduce the new ones.
982360	985000	And there is something, like, still, even to me now,
985000	986840	genuinely quite sad about this scene,
986840	988600	especially after having just watched the show.
988600	991400	We had two seasons of silly cartoon fights of Megatron,
991400	993320	and this time they just murdered each other?
993320	995640	The father figure of the show is just gone,
995640	998200	and there isn't really anyone left to take his place.
998840	1003000	And, like, that's really sad.
1003000	1005320	And this obviously had a massive impact on its audience.
1005320	1009000	Like, kids were crying in the theater and had to be dragged out.
1009000	1010600	There were tons of complaints.
1010600	1013560	Flint Dill has gone on the record as saying that, like,
1013560	1016840	he didn't really think it would have this kind of impact.
1016840	1017640	I'll get somebody saying,
1017640	1019400	how come you killed Optimus Prime?
1019400	1021320	I cried when you killed Optimus Prime.
1021320	1023640	But the real answer is that we, you know,
1023640	1025800	we didn't know that he was an icon.
1025800	1027240	As be- it was a toy show.
1027240	1029640	We just thought we were killing off the old product line,
1029640	1030920	introducing a new product.
1030920	1033400	And, you know, Optimus Prime was one of those guys.
1033400	1036040	They didn't think that they created, like, a cultural icon,
1036760	1039000	and, in a way,
1039000	1043160	I don't think they had created such an icon until they killed him.
1043160	1046040	And what makes it so impactful isn't just that people know the character.
1046040	1048520	If you had a scene like that for a character no one knew about,
1048520	1049800	it wouldn't be that interesting.
1049800	1053320	It's the specific juxtaposition of this
1053320	1054760	with the kind of immortal,
1054760	1057800	everything's fine, don't worry about it, nature of the show.
1057800	1062440	It just invented death in a universe where previously that couldn't happen,
1062440	1066920	and for a kid that's way, way more shocking than something you know just dying.
1066920	1068600	It's that specific contrast.
1068600	1071320	And I think this specifically is what makes the movie interesting,
1071320	1075080	and makes the movie and the show by relation
1075080	1077560	such a memorable pop cultural artifact.
1077560	1081240	It's this specific change they made,
1081240	1083480	which they didn't have to in the movie.
1083480	1087400	Like, in the show, as we explored, the story didn't really matter.
1087400	1090840	No one blinked an eye when everyone was dead for four million years.
1090840	1092280	Sometimes Megatron can fly.
1092280	1094360	Doesn't matter. It's fine. Don't worry about it.
1094360	1097000	All of a sudden, you do have to worry about it.
1097640	1099240	People can die now,
1099240	1103480	and that, to, like, a kid, is, like, a giant punch in the face.
1104040	1108120	It's like, oh god, there's a real world out there with consequences,
1108120	1109400	and I have to live in it.
1109400	1113400	For me, the introduction of Galactus and the death of Optimus Prime
1113560	1117000	are the actual beginning of the story of Transformers.
1117000	1118840	There are actual real big problems,
1118840	1121800	and not just these silly cartoony villains that you have to face.
1121800	1125560	There's this existential dread you have to somehow deal with,
1125560	1131480	and the people you look up to can go and just be gone,
1131480	1134520	and you might have to take their place,
1134520	1137640	or learn to make do in a world without them.
1137640	1139240	And how do you deal with that?
1139960	1144200	And all of a sudden, this silly show about space robots
1145240	1147480	has a meaningful story.
1147480	1150280	And I think that's why I find the Transformers movie so interesting,
1150280	1152360	and why I wanted to go back and think about it.
1152360	1154440	I didn't get a pet until I was a bit older,
1154440	1158680	so for me, like, the first time something that I knew about
1158680	1163000	and was kind of close to me died was the cartoon robot dad,
1163000	1165480	and the narrative of the movie actually explores
1165480	1167800	these really interesting questions and ideas
1167800	1171960	that you wouldn't expect to happen in the Transformers movie.
1171960	1174840	Questions like, how do you deal with the fact
1174840	1177640	that your existence is probably meaningless
1177640	1180680	and everyone you love can and will die?
1180680	1184040	These are, like, really important and difficult questions
1184040	1187560	that we as humans have been striving to try and answer
1187560	1190040	for hundreds if not thousands of years.
1190040	1192200	Like, that's basically all Friedrich Nietzsche did
1192200	1194760	until he, like, went mad and hugged a horse and died.
1194760	1198600	So ideally, the film would, in a perhaps kid-friendly way,
1198600	1201640	explore and maybe try and find some answers to these questions.
1201640	1205800	I said ideally there because it doesn't really.
1205800	1207320	Like, I've bigged this movie up a lot,
1207320	1208920	set up all the things about it that I like
1208920	1211880	and the interesting concepts that it kind of almost explores,
1212680	1214520	but the movie isn't very good.
1215160	1219160	Like, for all the bits in it that I like or think are really interesting,
1219160	1222040	there is a lot of bullshit.
1222040	1225800	There's loads of scenes of characters just faffing about
1225800	1229320	and saying one-liners that no one ever thought was cool.
1229320	1231880	Most egregious is the guy who talks really, really fast
1231880	1233720	because his thing is he moves really fast
1233720	1235720	and the little one that, like, talks in rhymes.
1235720	1236920	What about me, Magnus? What about me?
1236920	1238280	Mm-ha, mm-ha, mm-ha. I can help. I want to help.
1238280	1239000	What about me?
1239000	1241080	Friend, fine. Look behind.
1241080	1243480	You go wrong way. You fool, I say.
1243480	1244520	Absolutely, positively, definitely.
1244520	1245720	Nobody can get this job done faster than I can.
1245720	1246680	Nobody, nobody, nobody.
1246680	1249640	I've gone out of my way to not learn their names
1249640	1254360	because I want their existence to slide from my memory as quickly as possible.
1254360	1256280	If you think this film is actually good,
1256280	1259080	it's because you forgot about 75% of it.
1259080	1261720	But the 25% of stuff that's decent,
1261720	1264840	it actually deals with some really interesting stuff sometimes.
1264840	1268920	One scene I really quite like is when Unicron eats two of Cybertron's moons
1268920	1273240	and Bumblebee sets a bomb to detonate while it's being eaten by Unicron and they escape
1273800	1277960	and then it just isn't affected by the explosion at all
1277960	1282120	and they get sucked into Unicron and eaten and they're just gone for the rest of the movie
1282120	1285320	and you only found out that they didn't die, like, right at the end.
1285320	1286680	It isn't even dented!
1287240	1289480	Oh, shit! What are we gonna do now?
1289480	1292120	They actually said a swear in the children's film.
1292120	1294600	That's how bad things have got for the main characters.
1294600	1297240	I actually find this really compelling even as an adult.
1297240	1300120	Watching the characters see this horrible thing coming
1300120	1303880	and try to formulate a way of attacking it and getting away
1303880	1308280	and watching it just fail utterly and watch them get sucked in anyway,
1308280	1310120	it's, like, really cool.
1310120	1311880	And I think there's an important thematic thing there,
1311880	1315240	like, the characters are coping with the death of a lot of their friends
1315240	1318200	and even their leader, like, someone tremendously important to them,
1319160	1324920	and Unicron, if it represents nihilism or this understanding that life is meaningless,
1324920	1327720	in a really direct, literalized way,
1327720	1332360	the characters are trying to deal with and fail to deal with
1332840	1338680	this gnawing emptiness that tells them that life is pain.
1338680	1342040	And the whole movie is really about trying to escape the pull of these feelings
1342040	1344360	and do something with your life,
1344360	1346520	even though you know that at the end of it you die
1346520	1349400	and maybe all things don't really matter.
1350200	1355320	Like, the—the—the ultimate question of the film, basically,
1355320	1359480	is, oh, shit, what do we do now?
1359480	1361800	Like, even as an adult, I was kind of sucked in.
1361800	1363400	Like, what's gonna happen?
1363400	1366520	And the answer is… a lot of garbage.
1366520	1367960	–Nice, dino, good dino, sweet dino,
1367960	1368980	won't you step into the night spaceship,
1368980	1370520	and blow up pretty, please, pretty, pretty, pretty, please, nice dino.
1370520	1371540	–I'm trying to get them to the shuttle,
1371560	1372000	what's so magical?
1372000	1373640	–I'm gonna get on the dino, get on the dino, get on the dino!
1373640	1375400	–Oh, they're gonna mess about for a bit now,
1376040	1377640	Galvatron'll fly past and go,
1378280	1379480	ooh,
1379480	1382120	I'll get you.
1382120	1383240	Skrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
1383240	1384920	But I think we've established pretty successfully
1384920	1386920	what the questions of the movie are,
1386920	1390920	and that makes the scenes that are actually about that kind of cool
1390920	1392760	and interesting and cute
1392760	1396120	and stand out against the rubbish of the rest of the film.
1396120	1400840	There's a bit where Cup is telling this, like, old war story to the dinobots,
1400840	1402600	and they're all sitting around and listening,
1402600	1403560	and even Hot Rod's like,
1404360	1405640	why are you doing this?
1405640	1406680	What's the point of this?
1406680	1407640	We've got stuff to do.
1407640	1412040	And I find that scene actually really heartwarming and interesting.
1412040	1414760	Like, in the middle of this emotionally fraught situation
1414760	1417240	where bad stuff is happening and danger is present,
1417240	1420440	the character with the most knowledge and experience sits down and says,
1420520	1422600	let me tell you about another time it was bad.
1422600	1424520	And you realize, oh, wow,
1424520	1427320	when this movie's not just messing about,
1427320	1429240	it's actually just making a point here
1429240	1432760	about how, like, telling stories about other times when things were bad
1432760	1435640	helps us remember that things aren't actually bad all the time,
1435640	1437800	and there's lots of really good times
1437800	1439960	where life seems like it's worth living,
1439960	1441720	even if it ultimately isn't.
1441720	1442920	And you're like, oh.
1442920	1445880	There's, like, an interesting point here,
1445880	1448280	and it takes place in a scene
1448280	1453240	where a giant robot soldier is telling a bedtime story to a bunch of dinosaurs.
1453240	1454360	Like, in the context of the movie,
1454360	1457160	Unicron is really afraid of the Matrix of Leadership for some reason.
1457160	1460840	Like, it's the only thing that poses a threat to it.
1460840	1466440	And it's clear here what the Matrix of Leadership actually is.
1466440	1470680	It's all the stuff that the Autobots are doing to continue carrying on,
1470680	1473800	even when it seems pointless and like they can't win.
1473800	1478040	It's all the little things that actually constitute a morality.
1478040	1482200	That stuff is what allows the Autobots to carry on,
1482200	1484920	even when all of this bad stuff has happened.
1484920	1488360	And there's the specific thing that it's called the Matrix of Leadership,
1488360	1492040	and that begs the question of, like, what is leadership?
1492040	1496680	What was the je ne sais quoi that made Optimus Prime the cool guy?
1496680	1498600	And that's being explored here
1498600	1501080	in how the characters deal with this tough situation.
1501080	1505160	And what I find really interesting is that the guy who's picked as Prime's successor
1505240	1511400	is objectively really bad at the specific things required of leadership.
1511400	1513720	Like, Ultra Magnus even says in the scene, he's like,
1513720	1519480	But Prime, I'm—I'm just a soldier. I—I'm not worthy.
1519480	1522360	I am not a good successor to you.
1522360	1526200	I'm just a guy who's good at the thing that he does.
1526200	1531160	And he's right. Like, Ultra Magnus makes leadership decisions in the movie,
1531160	1534760	and they always are basically just concessions
1534760	1537800	to the Decepticons that actually make the situation worse.
1537800	1541960	Like, he pulls this clever trick where he lets most of his ship be blown up
1541960	1545160	so that, like, a little bit of it with them on it can escape,
1545160	1549560	and that buys them, like, five minutes of time in the movie.
1549560	1554040	And then after that, he creates a diversion so that the rest of his pals can escape,
1554040	1558280	which gives him and the Matrix to Galvatron.
1558360	1560120	Basically, just—he just loses.
1560120	1561880	He's just the highest-ranking guy.
1561880	1565720	He's not a conceptual leader-type figure.
1565720	1570680	He's not actually good at making the kind of high-concept decisions
1570680	1573560	a leader should make, whatever those may be.
1573560	1577080	I wonder if there's an answer to that question explored by the end of the story.
1577080	1579240	So that begs the ultimate questions.
1579240	1583640	What actually is leadership if it's not just being in charge?
1583640	1586440	And how do we make all of this work?
1586440	1591960	How do we make a positive change in a universe where it often seems hopeless?
1591960	1594360	And this gets explored on the other ship,
1594360	1597080	which also crash-lands, but on a different planet.
1597080	1599480	The one with Hot Rod and Cup and the Dinobots on it.
1599480	1605240	So they encounter these piranha-like, Transformer-ish robots,
1605240	1606280	and Cup's like,
1606280	1607560	We shouldn't fight them.
1607560	1610920	Let's do the universal greeting.
1610920	1612200	Don't act hostile.
1612200	1614440	I'll use the universal greeting.
1614440	1616280	Universal greeting?
1616280	1617160	Oh, we're going with this?
1617160	1621080	Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.
1621080	1623640	Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.
1623640	1627800	What I find interesting about this is the sheer friction
1627800	1632440	between the concept being explored and the way it's being explored.
1632440	1636840	Like, the idea of, in this vast universe with multiple different languages
1636840	1639640	and levels of intellect and consciousness,
1639640	1642920	the idea that there is a universal phrase
1642920	1646520	which to anyone means vaguely,
1646520	1648360	Hi, I'm your friend,
1648360	1650120	is, like, super fascinating.
1650120	1653560	Like, the idea of a universe where there is this central,
1653560	1656360	conceptual meaning and a way of communicating,
1656360	1657800	like, that's a thing.
1657800	1661240	And it's being explored by the robot saying,
1664520	1666760	Weep-a-boop-a-baaah.
1666760	1671320	Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-needy-bon.
1671400	1674600	See? The universal greeting works every time.
1674600	1676360	Bah-weep-boop-
1676360	1678280	I can't even be bothered to remember it.
1678280	1681000	It's so embarrassing and obnoxious,
1681000	1683080	and it just still makes me cringe.
1683080	1685000	And even as a kid, I was like,
1685000	1688040	Oh, no, I hope no one's watching me watching this.
1688920	1690760	I just, oh, God.
1691480	1692920	And it doesn't even work either.
1692920	1696600	They give them the candy, the laser candy,
1696600	1699560	and they run out and they just capture them anyway.
1699560	1700280	It doesn't work.
1700280	1701640	And this is another, like, cool way
1701640	1704280	that they juxtapose the reality of the story
1704280	1706520	with the kind of silliness of the cartoon.
1706520	1708520	They're like, no, this is real.
1708520	1710360	That childish nonsense doesn't work here.
1710360	1711320	You've got to be realistic.
1711320	1714920	You should have slaughtered those other sentient beings.
1714920	1716120	So they escape, they get on a ship,
1716120	1718280	and they go to pick up the other Autobots, right?
1718840	1721960	And then they have a repeat
1721960	1723640	of the last encounter they just had.
1723640	1725880	Like, they meet this new alien species
1725880	1727480	that might be possibly hostile,
1728120	1730600	and this time Kup's like,
1730600	1731640	let's just fucking shoot them.
1731640	1732680	We got them.
1732680	1735960	And then we get the point of the movie.
1735960	1739080	We get the moral core, the thesis of the film,
1739080	1743320	and it is simultaneously the silliest thing ever,
1743320	1748120	the worst, stupidest, most baddest scene ever,
1748120	1751000	and also amazing.
1751000	1753240	So Kup's gonna shoot them, right?
1753240	1754440	And Hot Rod goes,
1754440	1757560	no, I've discovered the moral core of the movie.
1759080	1761080	Let's do the universal greeting again.
1761080	1763240	What was that universal greeting again?
1763240	1764440	Never mind, I remember.
1765160	1768600	Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.
1768600	1769320	And they do it.
1771800	1774680	Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.
1775240	1778200	Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.
1778200	1778920	And it works.
1778920	1785080	Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-nini-bong.
1785080	1786520	And everyone's happy,
1786520	1789320	and they form like a circle around them,
1789320	1790840	and they do a big dance,
1790840	1792440	and everyone's their friend.
1792440	1793560	And then you're like, oh shit,
1794360	1796200	the movie's actually making a point here
1797080	1799000	with this incredibly childish thing.
1799000	1801800	The point is the childishness.
1801800	1803960	Like, the movie has just positioned
1804920	1809400	the naive and childish desire
1809400	1812200	to try to make friends in spite of everything
1812920	1818760	as the actual radical positive moral choice
1818760	1820360	to save the universe.
1820360	1821960	Where you try the thing,
1821960	1823480	even though the world has told you
1823480	1824920	it won't work and it'll be bad,
1825480	1827080	just in case it might.
1827080	1829080	Just in case you might actually be able
1829080	1830600	to unite with these other people.
1831800	1833480	And sometimes it works.
1833960	1835400	Despite appearing on the surface
1835400	1837320	to be a deeply cynical movie,
1837320	1838920	what it's actually doing is setting up
1838920	1840760	all the really good reasons
1840760	1843000	that you should be cynical about the world
1843000	1844120	and your place in it,
1844120	1845240	and then saying,
1845240	1847400	no, it's actually really good
1847400	1849240	to be a bit naive sometimes.
1849240	1850680	And maybe that's the thing.
1850680	1852280	Maybe that's the miraculous way
1852280	1854440	that we build a morality in this universe.
1854440	1856760	We, perhaps in a somewhat silly way,
1856760	1859320	assert that this does matter
1859320	1860600	and everything can work,
1860600	1862040	even if it doesn't seem like it.
1862040	1863720	And this is the film answering the question
1863720	1864920	of what is leadership.
1864920	1865640	Hot Rods goes,
1865640	1867960	no, let's not do the tactically clever thing.
1868600	1869960	Let's be unrealistic.
1869960	1871560	Let's believe that a peaceful,
1871560	1874360	mutually beneficial outcome is possible,
1874360	1876040	and we can actually all get on
1876040	1878040	and have this peaceful encounter.
1878040	1880440	And it seems like an unrealistic and silly thing,
1880440	1883240	but someone there asserting
1883240	1884760	that they believe it is possible
1885320	1886760	causes it to happen.
1887400	1891080	And that is an actual philosophical statement
1891080	1892760	about how to live in the world,
1892760	1895160	to insist, if not demand,
1895800	1898120	that better things are possible,
1898120	1901560	even when it specifically doesn't seem possible at all.
1901560	1902840	Literally this scene,
1902840	1904760	where all of a sudden
1904760	1907720	there's an answer to the darkness of the universe,
1907720	1909480	the song that plays over the scene
1909480	1912200	is Weird Al Yankovic's Dare to be Stupid.
1912200	1915080	["Dare to be Stupid"]
1915080	1917640	And that's literally the moral core of the film.
1917640	1919960	You have to dare to be stupid.
1919960	1924120	You have to believe in the incredibly silly, idyllic thing.
1924120	1925560	Ultra Magnus and the other robots
1925560	1927880	immediately get, like, forlorn,
1927880	1929720	and they want to be cynical again,
1929720	1930360	and Hunter says,
1930360	1932360	no, don't think about it in terms of
1932360	1934040	whether or not we have the MacGuffin.
1934040	1935720	Think about it in terms of
1935720	1938360	what we can do now to make it work.
1938360	1939800	You know, there's this old thing
1939800	1941320	that a philosopher guy said once.
1942280	1946040	A leader isn't someone who tells you what to do
1946040	1949640	and you obey because he's in a position of power over you.
1949720	1951800	A leader is someone who talks
1951800	1954440	and then you realize you believe them
1954440	1956200	and you want that thing to happen as well.
1956200	1959800	And that great philosopher's name was Optimus Prime,
1959800	1962120	and I find this sort of positivity
1962120	1963960	radically reshapes the universe thing
1965080	1966680	happening as well with Unicron.
1966680	1968840	Like, Galvatron tries to use the Matrix
1969480	1971320	and he doesn't really know how to understand it,
1971320	1973320	but he does use it in some capacity
1973320	1976120	because it suddenly causes Unicron
1976120	1978520	to transform and unfold
1978520	1980520	and you actually get the coolest scene in the movie,
1980520	1982440	this really awesome transformation sequence
1982440	1985000	where he unfolds and moves and shifts
1985000	1988040	and it's got some of the best music ever.
1988040	1990280	Like, I've listened to the Unicron theme medley
1990280	1994920	like 1,500 times in my life over the last decade.
1994920	1995880	It's just incredible.
1995880	1997320	Just Unicron's theme in general
1997320	1999000	is just this epic thing
1999000	2001960	where it's a mix of synthesizers and drums
2001960	2005880	and there's like this industrial hissing
2005880	2006360	and it's just...
2007320	2010520	I realize that almost all of my musical interests
2010520	2012360	spring forth in some fashion
2012360	2015240	from the soundscape of the various iterations
2015240	2017000	of the Unicron theme in the movie.
2017000	2018600	It's also, like, really, really cool
2018600	2020200	that the best scene in the movie
2020200	2023640	is literally just a scene of something transforming.
2023640	2026840	It's just, this is literally the film
2026840	2029320	and it's really cool. I love it.
2029320	2031080	But this scene is also a continuation
2031080	2032440	of the themes of the story.
2032440	2035240	Like, we've just seen that the assertion
2035240	2037080	that things can be made better
2037080	2038840	allows the impossible to happen.
2038840	2041000	People who would have been your enemies
2041000	2042200	if you'd approached them differently
2042200	2043320	are suddenly your friends
2043960	2046760	and with the mere application of the belief
2046760	2049080	that something can be done about Unicron,
2049880	2053000	all of a sudden Unicron becomes a comprehensible threat.
2053000	2057880	Unicron becomes mortal in response to Galvatron
2057880	2060200	trying to use the Matrix against him
2060200	2062120	and I find that super interesting.
2062120	2063880	Like, that's literally the themes of the film.
2063880	2065800	If you believe something can be done,
2065800	2067640	all of a sudden maybe it actually can be.
2067640	2069640	So Hot Rod crashes his ship
2069640	2071400	right through Unicron's eye
2072200	2073240	and, like, all of a sudden
2073240	2076440	this basically god-like creature
2076440	2079720	that eats planets and can't be harmed
2079720	2082360	by massive moon-sized explosions
2082360	2083400	and can suck people in
2083400	2084440	even when they're trying to escape,
2084440	2086200	all of a sudden he's, like, gasping in pain.
2086200	2086520	He goes,
2086520	2087720	"[screams in pain, laughs evilly"]
2087720	2089800	And his eye, because it's been smashed apart
2089800	2091240	and the crash is timed
2091240	2094040	with the first line of Stan Bush's song,
2094040	2094360	"'Dare.'"
2094360	2097160	["Dare!" by Stan Bush plays in the background.]
2097160	2099000	Where, again, it's the thing about daring, again.
2099000	2101640	It's, like, daring is, by definition,
2102360	2103640	believing in something
2103640	2106200	which it's not realistic to believe.
2106200	2110040	And this isn't just a ridiculous 80s rock anthem
2110040	2111720	about generic positivity
2111720	2113960	playing over a toy commercial film.
2113960	2115000	I mean, it is that,
2116040	2117240	but in addition,
2117240	2120040	it's a really interesting declaration
2120120	2124760	that doing the supposedly clever thing,
2124760	2126360	the realistic thing,
2126360	2127800	isn't really enough.
2127800	2130200	Sometimes you have to demand the impossible.
2130200	2132040	One last scene that I really, really like
2132040	2134200	is the bit between Galvatron and Hot Rod
2134200	2135080	when they're fighting
2135080	2136360	and Galvatron's like,
2136360	2138200	"'We should probably just come out and be killed by me.
2138200	2140200	I mean, we're all gonna die, right?'
2140200	2141640	["Come out, Autobot!
2142520	2144920	We all must die sometime!"
2144920	2145720	And Hot Rod goes,
2146600	2147320	"'No!'
2147320	2148520	and punches him.
2148520	2150120	"'Not today, Galvatron!'
2151560	2153960	And that exchange sums up the whole movie.
2153960	2156840	You know, the universe is dark and scary,
2156840	2158520	and maybe your life is meaningless,
2158520	2161240	and maybe we're all just sitting around waiting to die.
2161240	2163880	We're all just running out the biological clock,
2163880	2165560	but we're not gonna die today,
2166600	2168360	and things can be made better.
2168360	2170600	And this approach is what causes the Matrix
2170600	2173960	to finally activate and get all glowy and stuff,
2173960	2174440	and he's like,
2174440	2175640	"'I have the power!'
2175640	2176680	That's a different show.
2176680	2177800	I know it's a different show.
2178680	2179640	I was making a reference.
2179640	2181960	Stan Bush's The Touch starts playing,
2181960	2183480	and he gets all glowy,
2183480	2185320	and he transforms.
2185320	2187080	He evolves, and he doesn't hit B,
2187080	2188040	so it's permanent,
2188040	2189320	and he transforms into...
2191480	2192840	Rodimus Prime.
2192840	2197000	["Arise, Rodimus Prime!"
2197000	2199480	["Optimus!"
2200920	2203240	Come on, you almost let me use you
2203240	2205160	to make a really interesting point movie,
2205160	2208760	and then the main character's apotheosis
2208760	2212680	is to transform into someone called Rodimus Prime.
2212680	2216680	He's just, oh, there's a reason no one's taken this movie seriously
2216680	2218440	for 30 years.
2219560	2220360	Oh!"
2220360	2221320	And then he holds up the Matrix,
2221320	2222600	and Unicron explodes.
2222600	2224760	The power of leadership and hope
2224760	2227560	and unwarranted positivity in a dark universe
2227560	2231960	has successfully vanquished the pessimistic nihilism
2231960	2233320	that encroaches upon us all
2233320	2235000	when bad things happen in our lives.
2235000	2238760	Rodimus Prime discovered the magic of Xanax.
2240040	2242200	Rodimus Prime makes a speech about how, like,
2242920	2245640	now we're going to live in a world of peace
2245640	2249080	where everyone can be a part of this beautiful new world.
2249080	2251640	Just this ridiculously optimistic speech.
2251640	2256200	["We march forward to a new age of peace and happiness
2256200	2257800	till all are one!"
2257800	2258760	And it's like, yeah,
2258760	2260600	and then Unicron's head flies past,
2260600	2261160	and that's the end.
2261160	2263240	It just ends on that speech with the music playing
2263240	2263960	just like that.
2263960	2264760	We beat you.
2264760	2267160	Let's all live in peace and happiness forever.
2267160	2267720	Done.
2267720	2268360	Credits.
2268360	2268760	Go.
2268760	2271480	Just have a nice day, everyone.
2271480	2271960	I love it.
2271960	2274200	So yeah, it's not really that great a movie,
2274200	2275960	and the scenes that stand out,
2275960	2277880	especially to the kids who remembered it
2277880	2279960	from the time they first saw it,
2279960	2283880	they stand out usually because it was busy killing
2284680	2287720	a character that was well-known and important to you.
2287720	2290200	Like, it wasn't impactful because it was good.
2290200	2292280	It was impactful because it was horrifying
2292840	2296040	in, like, a really terrible way for a kid.
2296040	2298440	It didn't really stand out because of its quality.
2298440	2301080	Like, I find that I keep every couple of years
2301080	2303480	coming back to this movie in some form.
2303480	2306360	This movie is unmistakably a kind of standard
2306360	2309720	hero's journey transition into adulthood thing for Hot Rod.
2309720	2312200	Growing up, I appreciate that far more
2312200	2314840	because, like, I and a lot of the kids who watch this movie
2314840	2316360	have had to mature into adults
2316360	2318680	and encounter some of the emotions
2318680	2321400	that were first brought up for some kids in this film.
2321400	2323800	A lot of people have had to deal with the death of a parent
2323800	2328120	or someone really close to them and learn to cope with that.
2328760	2332200	And it's hard not to, in that process,
2332200	2334520	look back on a movie that is kind of about
2334520	2335640	dealing with those things.
2336360	2338040	Like, in a way, the Transformers movie
2338040	2341000	is more meaningful to adults now
2341000	2343720	than it ever could have been for kids then.
2343720	2345960	I think I find myself coming back to this movie
2345960	2350040	because I never feel like I'm quite done thinking about it
2350040	2352280	because its meaning keeps changing for me
2352920	2355560	as I keep changing as a person.
2355560	2359640	I, as a person, have grown up and changed a lot
2359640	2363240	in the last 10, 15, 20 years of my life.
2364440	2366840	A lot of things in the world have changed
2366840	2371800	and, in a way, one of the ways that you learn to deal with it
2371800	2373320	and fully appreciate those things
2373320	2375800	is you go back to something that you felt you knew
2376360	2382840	and look at it with the benefit of the new site that you have.
2382840	2384040	And I find that I keep doing this
2384040	2385880	with the Transformers movie in particular.
2385880	2388680	Like, five years ago, when I was just really into
2388680	2389880	how clever I thought I was,
2389880	2393480	I used to write for this website called smugfilm.com.
2393480	2394840	Like, that was supposed to be a joke.
2394840	2397160	Like, haha, we know how silly this looks.
2397160	2399560	But really, no, everyone on that site was pretty smug,
2399560	2400520	especially me.
2400520	2404280	And five years ago now, in 2014,
2405560	2409160	I wrote a piece about how the Transformers movie
2409160	2412360	is actually about the Nietzschean ideal.
2412360	2416360	How it's this, like, radical rebuttal to philosophical nihilism.
2417240	2418760	Like, that was incredibly silly.
2418760	2421000	But there was a time in my life
2421000	2423960	where I genuinely felt that way about the film
2424760	2428520	and felt that way about how to think about the world.
2428520	2432520	And one of the ways that I allowed myself to develop
2432520	2435880	was by reinvestigating what I had previously thought of
2435880	2438760	as just this fun movie that I thought was cool when I was a kid.
2439400	2442360	Like, in a way, it's only through nostalgia
2443000	2444760	that we understand the present
2444760	2447640	by fully accepting how we used to see something.
2447640	2449000	Don't read that article, by the way.
2449000	2451480	It's really not that great.
2451480	2455240	In fact, I still have some beef with the guy who ran the site.
2455240	2459240	He would edit the articles to be what he thought sounded better
2459240	2461000	and he would cut a bunch of the words out.
2461000	2464200	Like, I remember my original article being, like, twice as long
2464200	2467480	and he, like, cut out all my favorite bits and reworded some of it
2467480	2469800	and it just, I don't know, it just kind of annoyed me.
2469800	2470920	Don't read the old article, anyway.
2470920	2471880	It was bad before.
2471880	2473240	It was bad before it was edited.
2473240	2476360	We are all, in a very specific sense,
2476360	2481960	undergoing this eternal and never truly finished transformation.
2481960	2483640	We're always becoming something else
2484440	2489240	and this is one of the ways that we come to understand who we are now
2489240	2495160	is by looking at the things from our past with the new lens that we have
2495160	2500120	and, like, that, I think, is the value of nostalgia.
2500120	2504920	You have the ability to look back not just on something from the past
2504920	2507400	but on how you were in the past.
2507400	2509560	I think a lot of people are nostalgic for movies
2510200	2512440	not because there's something particularly great
2512440	2515160	about living in the 80s or something
2515160	2517000	but because being a kid in the 80s
2517000	2520040	when the worst thing that could possibly happen to you that day
2520040	2522760	was the cartoon dad robot died.
2523800	2526280	Like, that is a really nice time to be alive
2526280	2531560	that we all kind of, on some level, do appreciate more now that we don't have it.
2531560	2534040	We're coming up on, like, in a couple of months,
2534040	2539560	the 10-year anniversary of Lindsay Ellis's video about the Transformers movie.
2539560	2540280	She hates it.
2540280	2541800	She thinks it's terrible.
2541800	2544440	Like, 10 years.
2544440	2547560	I wasn't joking earlier in the video where I talked about how old I felt.
2547560	2553560	Like, in a way, this video is, like, a very brief midlife crisis for me
2553560	2556600	where I look back on how I used to think about some stuff
2556600	2559800	and my old YouTube videos and the things I used to do
2560360	2563560	and try and figure out where I've changed
2563560	2565720	and where I'm going and what I'm supposed to do
2566360	2569800	and I think the reason why I turn back to Transformers
2569800	2572440	is because it shouts the loudest and clearest,
2573080	2575560	the most valuable message for someone in that state,
2575560	2579080	which is demand the impossible.
2579080	2582600	Believe that it can be better even if it doesn't seem that way
2582600	2586280	and that's how finding the way out becomes possible
2586280	2590200	and I guess I never really stopped believing in the silly cartoon.
2590200	2593480	I just find better and better ways to intellectualize it.
2593480	2596760	For the first time in my life, I feel old.
2597080	2602360	I've felt like I was 19 until I was 26
2603320	2605960	and now I feel like an old person
2607320	2609560	and it's made me go,
2610840	2613240	well, who am I?
2613240	2615640	And looking back on all my old videos, it makes me think,
2615640	2618440	wow, I thought this was funny
2619480	2623480	and maybe I miss having that much future ahead of me
2623640	2627000	but it makes me happy to be who I am now.
2627000	2631240	It's fun realizing that while the past had its benefits,
2632120	2635320	the present and the future are pretty cool too.
2635320	2639080	This movie is a part of my process of thinking about life and the world
2639640	2643480	so it's been fun using it as an excuse to talk about these ideas now.
2644120	2650120	So, yeah, thanks for tuning in to my midlife crisis.
2650360	2655160	It's over now. I feel good again.
2655160	2658600	Thank you very much to the people who support me doing this
2658600	2662360	because I literally, literally couldn't be here doing this without you.
2662360	2666040	So for me now, the Transformers movie is unavoidably
2666040	2668760	about dealing with having to mature into a world
2668760	2671160	where no one really knows what's going on
2671160	2673240	and you have to somehow figure it out for yourself
2673240	2676200	and that makes the movie interesting to me even now,
2676200	2678360	even though it's measurably bad.
2678360	2681960	I guess the movie was more than meets the eye.
2685080	2686200	Oh my god.
