00:00.000 --> 00:01.880
So the Killing Joke movie came out.

00:01.880 --> 00:06.220
Great! Adaptations of Alan Moore's work. They've never been bad.

00:06.320 --> 00:10.060
Bwaaaahpahpahpapapapapapahpahpah!

00:10.060 --> 00:12.140
Papapapa! Papapapa!

00:13.980 --> 00:17.020
Ha! What is that sound effect?

00:17.620 --> 00:18.120
What?

00:19.580 --> 00:20.740
Ha ha ha ha!

00:20.740 --> 00:22.220
What the fuck is that?

00:22.220 --> 00:24.220
Okay, so it's not very good. It's not very good at all.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.360
Most fans of Batman or Batgirl at this point know that it adds, among other things,

00:28.760 --> 00:31.800
a scene where Barbara and Bruce have explicit sexual tension,

00:31.800 --> 00:33.240
followed by sex,

00:33.240 --> 00:34.760
followed by awkwardness,

00:34.760 --> 00:38.920
followed by Barbara taking out these feelings on a criminal by beating them completely senseless,

00:38.920 --> 00:40.200
followed by her quitting.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.200
It's lazy, and it's poorly written,

00:42.760 --> 00:44.040
and it's boring.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.320
But before we can really get into how and why

00:47.320 --> 00:51.320
Batman, colon, The Killing Joke, colon, the 2016 film is so bad,

00:51.320 --> 00:53.720
and at least learn a lesson of some kind from it,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.880
we have to talk about the comic industry.

00:55.960 --> 01:00.520
We have to talk about Batman, colon, The Killing Joke, colon, the 1988 comic.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.400
And we have to talk at least a little bit about Alan Moore,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.520
also known as the Rasputin of the comics industry,

01:06.520 --> 01:08.280
because he has a huge beard,

01:08.280 --> 01:09.480
will never die,

01:09.480 --> 01:11.480
and killed comics.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.360
Okay, when I said Alan Moore killed comics, I probably ought to qualify that.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.240
It's more that in the 90s, comics committed suicide,

01:21.240 --> 01:23.160
and it was Alan who handed them the rope.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.800
Moore is critically acclaimed for a very good reason,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.440
and in the mid to late 80s, he, along with Neil Gaiman,

01:28.440 --> 01:30.680
Art Spiegelman, Mark Waid, Garth Ennis,

01:30.680 --> 01:33.480
Frank Miller, in the brief period when he was properly medicated,

01:33.480 --> 01:36.520
and a good half dozen others formed a cabal of excellent writers

01:36.520 --> 01:39.400
that collectively ruined comics for the rest of time.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.080
No, seriously, for a second.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.240
These writers are good, and that's great.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.160
Their work read well and did well critically,

01:45.160 --> 01:47.800
but unfortunately, it also sold well.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.440
And art doesn't make the comics industry go round.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.200
Money does.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.440
And everyone wanted a piece of the pie.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.760
Everyone wanted to make the next Watchmen,

01:56.760 --> 01:58.920
to do Dark Knight Returns' numbers,

01:58.920 --> 02:01.240
and everyone thought they knew exactly how best

02:01.240 --> 02:04.760
to imitate those works and themselves create a timeless piece of art.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.800
So for every gritty but thoughtful and interesting look at Batman,

02:07.800 --> 02:10.760
or every well-explored morally ambiguous Rorschach,

02:10.760 --> 02:13.080
or every cool moment that Wolverine did,

02:13.080 --> 02:14.840
there would be Cable,

02:14.840 --> 02:15.960
Cardiac,

02:15.960 --> 02:17.080
Lady Blaze,

02:17.080 --> 02:18.280
Death Watch, Dream Slayer,

02:18.280 --> 02:19.720
Forearm, Whiplash,

02:19.720 --> 02:20.760
Wild Side,

02:20.760 --> 02:21.720
Zero, Ajax,

02:21.720 --> 02:22.680
Bloody Mary,

02:24.600 --> 02:25.080
Crippler,

02:25.080 --> 02:25.800
Siege,

02:25.800 --> 02:26.360
D.Vos,

02:26.360 --> 02:27.080
The Devastator,

02:27.080 --> 02:27.720
Gormonarch,

02:27.720 --> 02:28.280
Shatterstar,

02:28.280 --> 02:28.760
Bad Rock,

02:28.760 --> 02:29.560
Shagger,

02:29.560 --> 02:29.960
Blood,

02:30.840 --> 02:31.560
Die Hard,

02:31.560 --> 02:32.040
Sentinel,

02:32.040 --> 02:33.480
Troll Wolverine,

02:33.480 --> 02:34.040
Prophet,

02:34.040 --> 02:34.680
Knight,

02:34.680 --> 02:35.320
Sabre,

02:35.320 --> 02:35.880
Photon,

02:35.880 --> 02:36.360
Brahma,

02:36.360 --> 02:36.920
Cross,

02:36.920 --> 02:37.480
TASK?!

02:37.480 --> 02:38.360
WHAT?!

02:38.360 --> 02:38.680
WHAT?!

02:38.680 --> 02:39.800
Wildmane,

02:39.800 --> 02:41.160
Wolverine,

02:41.160 --> 02:42.600
Warwolf-erine,

02:43.640 --> 02:44.360
Warblade,

02:44.360 --> 02:45.480
Wildstar,

02:45.480 --> 02:47.160
Ripclaw-verine,

02:47.160 --> 02:47.960
Deadlock,

02:47.960 --> 02:48.920
Strongarm,

02:48.920 --> 02:50.200
Mrs. Sexdeath,

02:50.680 --> 02:52.360
Strongshot,

02:52.360 --> 02:53.480
Deadblast,

02:54.280 --> 02:56.520
Smash Beef,

02:56.520 --> 02:58.360
and Settlers of Catan.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.840
Those early comics were good because they were unique.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.200
They were nuanced.

03:02.200 --> 03:07.640
This early panel in the Killing Joke highlights the attempts at levity from the people who work in Arkham Asylum.

03:07.640 --> 03:12.040
It also sets up that in order to really deal with the bullshit of the people who end up there,

03:12.040 --> 03:14.440
you probably have to be a little insane yourself,

03:14.440 --> 03:16.120
the point being that Batman,

03:16.120 --> 03:20.040
the guy with parental issues who dresses up as a bat while he's getting people put in there,

03:20.040 --> 03:22.360
might have some issues to explore himself.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.800
A little jokey sign on a table sets up the story's themes,

03:25.800 --> 03:28.760
but also the characters of the story and their attitudes.

03:28.760 --> 03:33.560
Alan Moore was famous for writing pages and pages of descriptions for everything in his panels for the artist,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.720
the stuff on their desks and what it says about them,

03:35.720 --> 03:37.560
the quality of the motes of light,

03:37.560 --> 03:39.640
stuff the artist probably would never actually draw,

03:39.640 --> 03:43.720
but which perfectly set the mood for the artist to then get across how they see fit.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.040
If you want to know what makes a great comic work,

03:46.040 --> 03:47.480
don't just look at the basic plot,

03:47.480 --> 03:48.680
the important monologues,

03:48.680 --> 03:49.560
the writing,

03:49.640 --> 03:50.360
as it were.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.600
Look at the desks and bookcases and bedside tables of Moore's world.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.120
That's the real writing.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.040
And then flip through a copy of, say,

03:58.040 --> 04:00.680
Youngblood and look at how barren everything is.

04:00.680 --> 04:05.080
These comics are supposedly set in a grimdark world where heroes are antiheroes,

04:05.080 --> 04:07.880
but quite often they simply just tell you that

04:07.880 --> 04:11.560
and then show you shots of characters monologuing about how complex they are

04:11.560 --> 04:15.080
in empty characterless rooms or just straight-up blank voids.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.000
This comic is drawn by Rob Liefeld.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.720
He's a bad artist and a bad writer and bad, bad, bad!

04:23.720 --> 04:25.880
And everything wrong with comics in the 90s.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.520
Here's Rob and Todd McFarlane designing a character from scratch

04:28.520 --> 04:31.000
during the taping of a show Stan Lee used to do.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.160
But I highly recommend you watch the whole thing for yourself.

04:33.160 --> 04:33.960
It's on YouTube.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.720
It's very informative about the problem with 90s character design as a whole

04:37.720 --> 04:42.200
because despite ostensibly being 30 minutes of these guys designing a character,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.920
no designing actually happens.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.160
Stanny Boy gives them the name Overkill,

04:47.160 --> 04:49.240
and Rob, seemingly on autopilot,

04:49.240 --> 04:52.680
begins making a variation of Cable, one of his other characters.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.400
-"Over there, right?" -"He's gotta be a guy. He's gotta be huge."

04:56.280 --> 04:58.600
-"Thick neck, broad shoulders." -"Thickest neck. Thickest shoulders."

04:58.600 --> 05:00.680
-"Are you gonna give him the usual shoulder pads?"

05:00.680 --> 05:03.480
-"Uh, I don't know. I'm not real sure yet. What do you think, Todd?"

05:03.480 --> 05:07.720
-"I don't know. A Liefeld character without shoulder pads is almost naked.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.680
How would you say that his personality would be different

05:10.680 --> 05:15.000
from most of our other tough guys, like Wolverine and all the others?

05:16.040 --> 05:16.600
And Cable?"

05:16.600 --> 05:20.200
-"See, somehow, like, he's a half-man, half-machine.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.760
He's, you know, fighting that inside.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.480
He's partly a cyborg.

05:25.480 --> 05:30.600
You know, he's a combination of technology and brutality."

05:30.600 --> 05:31.000
-"All right."

05:34.120 --> 05:37.640
Cable was conceived by Liefeld as a darker, edgier X-Man

05:37.640 --> 05:40.440
to lead a new team into the era of gritty comics,

05:40.440 --> 05:44.840
a repackaged collection of tropes pioneered in the good comics of the late 80s.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.760
But Cable himself got so popular that during the taping of this show a year later,

05:48.760 --> 05:52.760
Rob was already cannibalizing his own work, never mind everyone else's.

05:52.760 --> 05:57.000
And unfortunately, during his heyday, he never bothered to learn how to draw the feet.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.480
These kinds of creators read Watchmen, read The Dark Knight Returns, read The Killing Joke,

06:01.480 --> 06:04.280
works that presented characters as flawed but real

06:04.280 --> 06:07.720
and used even desks as characterization and world-building,

06:07.720 --> 06:10.920
works that had, to put it in one word, ideas.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.120
But these creators didn't see that stuff when they read those comics.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.480
They saw the darkness, the edginess, the grittiness on the surface

06:17.480 --> 06:19.720
and tried desperately to recreate that.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.600
The appearance of depth mattered more than the real stuff.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.800
Todd and Rob's company literally called itself Image Comics,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.720
which I feel is a really ironic name

06:27.720 --> 06:31.160
given their obsession with looking interesting without actually being it.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.120
This character they're designing shows up in McFarlane's Spawn comics,

06:34.200 --> 06:36.200
as Overt Kill.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.280
Yeah, they called it that.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.080
Comics pioneered the expanded universe concept,

06:41.080 --> 06:44.200
finding new ways to tack more things for you to spend money on

06:44.200 --> 06:46.120
onto initially decent ideas.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.840
Now you're now doing an X Factor book, I believe.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.800
X-Force.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.360
X-Force?

06:50.360 --> 06:50.680
Yeah.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.320
X-Force, that's right.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.360
Everyone confuses them.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.320
F-Factor Force, man.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.680
How many X-Books do we have?

06:54.680 --> 06:57.000
I think there's, like, eight, ten now.

06:57.000 --> 06:57.720
I mean, everything.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.640
They got, they got, there's the team books

06:59.640 --> 07:01.320
and then each member of the team has their own book.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.120
So, yeah, people get all confused all the time.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.200
There used to be one X-Men book and one Spider-Man book.

07:06.200 --> 07:06.440
Yeah.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.680
And there's five Spider-Mans and there's five X-Men, so...

07:09.400 --> 07:11.240
When we get a good thing, we don't let it go.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.360
That's right, no.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.760
But with stories as complete, self-contained,

07:14.760 --> 07:17.640
and final as The Dark Knight Returns or Watchmen,

07:17.640 --> 07:18.760
they couldn't do that.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.640
They had to recreate the tone in other stories.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.560
It took decades for them to finally say,

07:23.560 --> 07:26.040
fuck it and make needless prequels to Watchmen

07:26.040 --> 07:28.760
and for Frank Miller to so utterly lose his mind

07:28.760 --> 07:31.000
that he decided to make The Dark Knight Rides again,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.520
a comic which seems to have forgotten

07:32.520 --> 07:35.480
that Batman being kind of fascist was a bad thing.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.760
With all that out of the way,

07:36.760 --> 07:39.800
what makes the movie adaptation of this comic so bad?

07:39.800 --> 07:40.680
Well, to start off with,

07:40.680 --> 07:43.560
the first 28 minutes have nothing to do with the killing joke.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.920
They're purely focused on Barbara and her relationship with Bruce.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.320
Things come to a head with the stuff I already mentioned

07:49.320 --> 07:50.440
and then she quits.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.640
It's a little more than padding

07:51.640 --> 07:53.800
because the killing joke is too singular and short

07:53.800 --> 07:56.600
to be easily forced into the narrative of a full feature.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.760
The last moments of Barbara being Batgirl

07:58.760 --> 08:00.840
are used as uninteresting filler.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.680
Which in a way is kind of fitting, isn't it?

08:02.680 --> 08:05.560
And reflects how Batgirl was treated in general in the comics

08:05.560 --> 08:07.240
and the reason why she came to be viewed

08:07.240 --> 08:09.640
as narratively expendable in the first place.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.080
I could talk at length here

08:11.080 --> 08:13.560
about how the killing or serious injuring

08:13.560 --> 08:15.640
of female characters for easy dramatic effect

08:15.640 --> 08:18.520
is a problem that has and continues to plague comics.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.200
But if you need me to say

08:20.200 --> 08:23.160
that comics have a history of bizarre treatment of female characters,

08:23.160 --> 08:24.840
you probably already think I'm wrong

08:24.840 --> 08:27.480
and comics don't need to have characters relatable to women

08:27.480 --> 08:29.320
because half the planet's disposable income

08:29.320 --> 08:30.600
is apparently not worth having.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.200
And everyone who already knows this

08:32.200 --> 08:34.440
doesn't need to be told again by me.

08:34.440 --> 08:35.880
So why bother?

08:35.880 --> 08:37.080
Needless to say though,

08:37.080 --> 08:38.600
Barbara getting shot and paralyzed

08:38.600 --> 08:40.120
and then literally objectified

08:40.120 --> 08:41.800
in order to hurt her father's feelings

08:41.800 --> 08:44.360
is, while well done and genuinely shocking,

08:44.360 --> 08:46.920
still weirdly cliche for Alan Moore.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.120
It's also probably worth mentioning

08:48.120 --> 08:49.960
that even Alan Moore has his misgivings

08:49.960 --> 08:51.560
about the killing joke at this point.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.440
Probably the work of mine that I'm least fond of

08:54.440 --> 08:57.800
because there's a lot of nasty things happening in that

08:57.800 --> 09:00.920
and Brian Bolland did a wonderful job on the artwork

09:00.920 --> 09:03.000
but, um, as for my writing,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.080
no, that's not one of my finest hours.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.000
So if you're planning on leaving a comment

09:07.000 --> 09:08.360
talking about how wrong it is

09:08.360 --> 09:13.400
to criticize such a masterpiece magic comic in comic history

09:13.400 --> 09:14.920
and Alan Moore's a genius,

09:14.920 --> 09:18.440
well, maybe listen to what Alan Moore has to say about it nowadays

09:18.440 --> 09:20.520
if you think he's so fucking smart, you piece of shit.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.120
The new opening section has Barbara doing voiceover for some reason.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.920
I don't know why and I don't really see what it adds.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.320
I really was done with that part of my life.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.800
A week later, it wouldn't matter anyway.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.200
A terrible storm was moving in

09:34.920 --> 09:36.360
and we'd all be in for it by then.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.920
Oh, a storm's coming in.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.040
How fucking deep.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.920
Oh, oh, let me tell you about the weather.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.120
My name's Packer.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.600
Having sex with Bruce and having mixed feelings about it

09:46.600 --> 09:49.400
and feeling bad for taking those feelings out on a criminal

09:49.400 --> 09:51.320
are attempts to give the character some issues

09:51.320 --> 09:52.840
to really grapple with

09:52.840 --> 09:55.720
and I wish I could say I at least appreciate these attempts

09:55.720 --> 09:58.360
but it's just not very good or original.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.720
Depth comes from within,

09:59.720 --> 10:02.840
from the ideas that a writer wants to impose on a story.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.520
It doesn't spurt from the wounds of your enemies or Batman's dick.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.640
These complexities are raised and then she quits and gets shot.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.480
So what was the point in even raising them?

10:11.480 --> 10:14.840
It also adds a post-credits scene setting up that she becomes Oracle.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.400
Ooh, one day something interesting might happen.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.360
That was worth watching a fucking entire film for.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.320
I could stop right here because an adaptation of a very good work

10:23.320 --> 10:26.200
opening with 28 minutes of bad unrelated filler

10:26.200 --> 10:29.320
is usually enough of a deal-breaker, critically speaking.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.720
There's a reason The Killing Joke opened where it did

10:31.720 --> 10:34.040
and not with pages and pages of bullshit

10:34.040 --> 10:37.160
but even the real thing is adapted poorly once it starts.

10:37.160 --> 10:42.280
Remember the receptionist's desk I waxed lyrically about for like five whole minutes?

10:42.280 --> 10:43.880
The desk here is empty.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.080
It's a desk with a computer on it.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.440
It's like a flat plane.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.760
This film is the new textbook case of a bad adaptation of a comic for me now.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.160
It starts with nearly 30 minutes of pointless fluff

10:55.160 --> 10:59.800
and then when the story starts all the actual stuff that made it worth adapting is gone.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.240
It's like they didn't even understand why The Killing Joke worked so well

11:03.240 --> 11:07.240
by being a story that was very careful with particulars and mundanities.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.760
So when you turn the page and the Joker is now shooting Barbara,

11:10.760 --> 11:12.680
it's sudden and shocking.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.760
The comic uses the bars of a cell to separate both sides of Harvey Dent

11:16.760 --> 11:20.920
and in this comic each side looks a little bit like Batman and the Joker

11:20.920 --> 11:22.920
setting up the dynamic of the story.

11:22.920 --> 11:26.440
Gordon tries to push past quickly but when he realizes Harvey's watching him,

11:26.440 --> 11:29.240
he can't help but look back at his old friend as he passes.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.680
It sets up how once good people really can just go insane

11:32.680 --> 11:35.880
which I don't know is maybe kind of the point of the fucking story.

11:35.880 --> 11:39.000
In the animated movie, oh look there's a coin.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.360
Remember the coin?

11:40.360 --> 11:44.760
He dropped his coin through the bars of his cell somehow

11:44.760 --> 11:46.680
and Gordon just walks past.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.600
If I was going to adapt The Killing Joke,

11:48.600 --> 11:50.920
the one thing I would definitely think to flesh out

11:50.920 --> 11:54.280
was to build on this moment where Gordon is looking back at a man

11:54.280 --> 11:57.480
who he later might just have ended up becoming

11:57.480 --> 12:00.040
after being subjected to the Joker's torment.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.080
This adaptation un-fleshes out the characters.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.680
It takes out character that the original comic had.

12:06.680 --> 12:10.040
It's kind of amazing that they managed to adapt a comic so badly

12:10.040 --> 12:13.160
that they added half an hour of pointless filler to pad for time

12:13.160 --> 12:16.200
while taking out the most interesting parts.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.680
Is this the Joker's real trick to, you know,

12:18.680 --> 12:23.080
piss off and troll fans of Batman by adapting a comic so poorly?

12:23.080 --> 12:27.800
The flashbacks into the Joker's potential past used very precise colors

12:27.800 --> 12:29.800
highlighting seemingly random objects

12:29.800 --> 12:34.040
as everything else is silhouetted in darkness and noirish black and white.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.160
Usually there's something that would form a very big piece of a person's memory

12:37.160 --> 12:38.840
like the smell of a shrimp

12:38.840 --> 12:41.240
or the tint of the red hood that covers his face

12:41.240 --> 12:44.360
and plays a part in the metaphorical coloring of his worldview.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.880
The Killing Joke movie just uses semi-muted colors

12:47.880 --> 12:51.320
which is THE generic flashback-looking effect, isn't it?

12:51.320 --> 12:54.440
And the really striking cuts between memory and reality

12:54.440 --> 12:57.800
that were stark and direct and shockingly personal

12:57.800 --> 13:00.040
for such a seemingly insane character?

13:00.040 --> 13:03.000
In this, it just fades to a random shot of the Joker

13:03.000 --> 13:06.280
with his hand against a glass looking incredibly dopey.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.720
Seriously, what even is that face?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.800
What emotion is trying to be conveyed here?

13:09.800 --> 13:12.360
Who drew this? Did they commission Rob Liefeld to draw this?

13:12.360 --> 13:13.560
What the f—what?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.040
I bet if you search DeviantArt you'll find—

13:16.040 --> 13:20.120
you'll find a better drawing of this exact moment than in this movie.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.200
Although the Joker will probably be fully nude

13:22.200 --> 13:25.480
but that doesn't really detract from the emotions of the scene, I feel.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.840
And in the climactic showdown

13:26.840 --> 13:29.080
where the Joker suddenly pulls an earnest face

13:29.080 --> 13:30.600
and you realize that what he really wants

13:30.600 --> 13:33.160
is to prove to someone else that his perspective is correct

13:33.160 --> 13:35.320
so that he can finally feel justified in it

13:35.320 --> 13:37.560
and maybe because Batman isn't responding

13:37.560 --> 13:39.320
he has to consider he's wrong?

13:39.320 --> 13:42.520
Like Gordon, he's trying to show Batman his way works

13:42.520 --> 13:44.120
and Batman doesn't believe him.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.400
For a moment, even his faith in his beliefs is shaken.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.360
It's at that moment that Batman appears and attacks him,

13:50.360 --> 13:53.160
seemingly a manifestation of the Joker's own self-doubt.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.280
Why aren't you laughing?

13:58.280 --> 14:02.040
In the movie, he's just saying these lines as he has a punch fight with Batman.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.160
Apparently, the Hall of Mirrors scene wasn't weird and cool enough

14:05.160 --> 14:06.920
for the creators of this adaptation.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.200
They had to have an extra section

14:08.200 --> 14:11.080
where Batman and the Joker fight in a recreation of his apartment

14:11.080 --> 14:12.680
but with the furniture glued to the ceiling

14:12.680 --> 14:14.920
because his life was flipped turn upside down

14:14.920 --> 14:17.080
and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,

14:17.080 --> 14:20.440
I'll tell you all about how I became the clown prince of crime!

14:20.440 --> 14:22.920
The writer behind the adaptation, Brian Azzarello,

14:22.920 --> 14:25.240
is also the guy who wrote some of those Watchmen prequels

14:25.240 --> 14:26.280
I talked about earlier.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.960
Between this and the 30-minute opening,

14:27.960 --> 14:29.960
it appears he specializes in the production

14:29.960 --> 14:33.000
of needless preamble to actually good stories,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.240
which is a shame because I remember really liking

14:35.240 --> 14:36.600
what I read of A Hundred Bullets

14:36.600 --> 14:38.920
and his run on Wonder Woman is apparently really good,

14:38.920 --> 14:40.600
though I could never bring myself to read it

14:40.600 --> 14:42.200
because they're the best superhero

14:42.200 --> 14:44.200
and I don't go out of my way to read things

14:44.200 --> 14:45.560
I expect to disappoint me?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.800
I'm not that kind of masochist.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.480
Please don't kink shame!

14:49.480 --> 14:51.720
To put it simply, the Killing Joke movie's real problem

14:51.720 --> 14:53.880
isn't poor writing or low-budget animation,

14:53.880 --> 14:56.760
but don't get me wrong, it has a fucking trowel full of that.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.760
Its central issue is the same problem

14:58.760 --> 15:01.800
all the stories that aped the original comic so badly had.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.240
It's THE problem,

15:03.240 --> 15:05.880
the one that's plagued comic history for all time,

15:05.880 --> 15:08.200
the endless commodification of good work

15:08.200 --> 15:11.080
but in a manner that renders its copies devoid of meaning,

15:11.080 --> 15:14.120
sold based on the mere resemblance to that good stuff.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.280
All these problems have finally come home to roost

15:16.280 --> 15:18.280
within the fabric of the Killing Joke itself

15:18.280 --> 15:22.280
in the form of this lazy, cash-in adaptation 25 years later.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.680
Like with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns before it,

15:24.680 --> 15:27.240
it's been transformed into an expanded universe,

15:27.240 --> 15:31.080
coming attached with its very own vestigial, worthless prequel,

15:31.080 --> 15:33.720
and all its beautiful imagery has been stripped away.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.160
The art is quite literally gone from The Killing Joke.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.800
You see what those bloody corporations do?

15:39.800 --> 15:42.520
They take your ideas and they suck them.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.880
Suck them like leeches

15:43.880 --> 15:47.960
until they've gotten every last drop of the marrow from your bones.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.320
While it could be dismissed as garbage to be left by the wayside,

15:51.320 --> 15:52.760
what makes it worth looking at

15:52.760 --> 15:55.880
is how emblematic it is of all these wider problems.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.600
Accidentally, it's the ultimate modern demonstration

15:58.600 --> 16:00.680
of the problem with comics.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.640
At least until one of Rob Liefeld's comics gets an adaptation.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.760
Ah, I hope they adapt the arc

16:04.760 --> 16:06.840
where sex death orchestrates her own murder

16:06.840 --> 16:08.280
to hurt Strongshot's feelings

16:08.280 --> 16:10.120
and he puts valiant comics out of business

16:10.120 --> 16:11.880
by refusing to work for 12 months.
