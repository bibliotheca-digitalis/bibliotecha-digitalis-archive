1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
So the Killing Joke movie came out.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,220
Great! Adaptations of Alan Moore's work. They've never been bad.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,060
Bwaaaahpahpahpapapapapapahpahpah!

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,140
Papapapa! Papapapa!

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,020
Ha! What is that sound effect?

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,120
What?

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,740
Ha ha ha ha!

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,220
What the fuck is that?

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,220
Okay, so it's not very good. It's not very good at all.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,360
Most fans of Batman or Batgirl at this point know that it adds, among other things,

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,800
a scene where Barbara and Bruce have explicit sexual tension,

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,240
followed by sex,

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,760
followed by awkwardness,

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,920
followed by Barbara taking out these feelings on a criminal by beating them completely senseless,

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,200
followed by her quitting.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
It's lazy, and it's poorly written,

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,040
and it's boring.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,320
But before we can really get into how and why

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Batman, colon, The Killing Joke, colon, the 2016 film is so bad,

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,720
and at least learn a lesson of some kind from it,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,880
we have to talk about the comic industry.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,520
We have to talk about Batman, colon, The Killing Joke, colon, the 1988 comic.

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,400
And we have to talk at least a little bit about Alan Moore,

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,520
also known as the Rasputin of the comics industry,

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,280
because he has a huge beard,

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,480
will never die,

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
and killed comics.

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,360
Okay, when I said Alan Moore killed comics, I probably ought to qualify that.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,240
It's more that in the 90s, comics committed suicide,

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,160
and it was Alan who handed them the rope.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,800
Moore is critically acclaimed for a very good reason,

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,440
and in the mid to late 80s, he, along with Neil Gaiman,

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,680
Art Spiegelman, Mark Waid, Garth Ennis,

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,480
Frank Miller, in the brief period when he was properly medicated,

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,520
and a good half dozen others formed a cabal of excellent writers

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,400
that collectively ruined comics for the rest of time.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,080
No, seriously, for a second.

38
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,240
These writers are good, and that's great.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,160
Their work read well and did well critically,

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,800
but unfortunately, it also sold well.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,440
And art doesn't make the comics industry go round.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Money does.

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,440
And everyone wanted a piece of the pie.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,760
Everyone wanted to make the next Watchmen,

45
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,920
to do Dark Knight Returns' numbers,

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,240
and everyone thought they knew exactly how best

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,760
to imitate those works and themselves create a timeless piece of art.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,800
So for every gritty but thoughtful and interesting look at Batman,

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,760
or every well-explored morally ambiguous Rorschach,

50
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,080
or every cool moment that Wolverine did,

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,840
there would be Cable,

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,960
Cardiac,

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,080
Lady Blaze,

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Death Watch, Dream Slayer,

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Forearm, Whiplash,

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,760
Wild Side,

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,720
Zero, Ajax,

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
Bloody Mary,

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,080
Crippler,

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Siege,

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,360
D.Vos,

62
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,080
The Devastator,

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,720
Gormonarch,

64
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,280
Shatterstar,

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,760
Bad Rock,

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
Shagger,

67
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,960
Blood,

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Die Hard,

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,040
Sentinel,

70
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,480
Troll Wolverine,

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,040
Prophet,

72
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,680
Knight,

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,320
Sabre,

74
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,880
Photon,

75
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,360
Brahma,

76
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,920
Cross,

77
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,480
TASK?!

78
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,360
WHAT?!

79
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,680
WHAT?!

80
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,800
Wildmane,

81
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,160
Wolverine,

82
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Warwolf-erine,

83
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,360
Warblade,

84
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,480
Wildstar,

85
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
Ripclaw-verine,

86
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
Deadlock,

87
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
Strongarm,

88
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
Mrs. Sexdeath,

89
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,360
Strongshot,

90
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,480
Deadblast,

91
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,520
Smash Beef,

92
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
and Settlers of Catan.

93
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,840
Those early comics were good because they were unique.

94
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
They were nuanced.

95
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,640
This early panel in the Killing Joke highlights the attempts at levity from the people who work in Arkham Asylum.

96
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,040
It also sets up that in order to really deal with the bullshit of the people who end up there,

97
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,440
you probably have to be a little insane yourself,

98
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,120
the point being that Batman,

99
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,040
the guy with parental issues who dresses up as a bat while he's getting people put in there,

100
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,360
might have some issues to explore himself.

101
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,800
A little jokey sign on a table sets up the story's themes,

102
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,760
but also the characters of the story and their attitudes.

103
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,560
Alan Moore was famous for writing pages and pages of descriptions for everything in his panels for the artist,

104
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,720
the stuff on their desks and what it says about them,

105
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,560
the quality of the motes of light,

106
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,640
stuff the artist probably would never actually draw,

107
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,720
but which perfectly set the mood for the artist to then get across how they see fit.

108
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,040
If you want to know what makes a great comic work,

109
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
don't just look at the basic plot,

110
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680
the important monologues,

111
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,560
the writing,

112
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,360
as it were.

113
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,600
Look at the desks and bookcases and bedside tables of Moore's world.

114
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,120
That's the real writing.

115
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,040
And then flip through a copy of, say,

116
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,680
Youngblood and look at how barren everything is.

117
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,080
These comics are supposedly set in a grimdark world where heroes are antiheroes,

118
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,880
but quite often they simply just tell you that

119
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,560
and then show you shots of characters monologuing about how complex they are

120
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,080
in empty characterless rooms or just straight-up blank voids.

121
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,000
This comic is drawn by Rob Liefeld.

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,720
He's a bad artist and a bad writer and bad, bad, bad!

123
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,880
And everything wrong with comics in the 90s.

124
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,520
Here's Rob and Todd McFarlane designing a character from scratch

125
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,000
during the taping of a show Stan Lee used to do.

126
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,160
But I highly recommend you watch the whole thing for yourself.

127
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,960
It's on YouTube.

128
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,720
It's very informative about the problem with 90s character design as a whole

129
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,200
because despite ostensibly being 30 minutes of these guys designing a character,

130
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,920
no designing actually happens.

131
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,160
Stanny Boy gives them the name Overkill,

132
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,240
and Rob, seemingly on autopilot,

133
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,680
begins making a variation of Cable, one of his other characters.

134
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,400
-"Over there, right?" -"He's gotta be a guy. He's gotta be huge."

135
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,600
-"Thick neck, broad shoulders." -"Thickest neck. Thickest shoulders."

136
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,680
-"Are you gonna give him the usual shoulder pads?"

137
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,480
-"Uh, I don't know. I'm not real sure yet. What do you think, Todd?"

138
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,720
-"I don't know. A Liefeld character without shoulder pads is almost naked.

139
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,680
How would you say that his personality would be different

140
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,000
from most of our other tough guys, like Wolverine and all the others?

141
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,600
And Cable?"

142
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,200
-"See, somehow, like, he's a half-man, half-machine.

143
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,760
He's, you know, fighting that inside.

144
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,480
He's partly a cyborg.

145
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,600
You know, he's a combination of technology and brutality."

146
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,000
-"All right."

147
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,640
Cable was conceived by Liefeld as a darker, edgier X-Man

148
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,440
to lead a new team into the era of gritty comics,

149
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,840
a repackaged collection of tropes pioneered in the good comics of the late 80s.

150
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,760
But Cable himself got so popular that during the taping of this show a year later,

151
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Rob was already cannibalizing his own work, never mind everyone else's.

152
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,000
And unfortunately, during his heyday, he never bothered to learn how to draw the feet.

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,480
These kinds of creators read Watchmen, read The Dark Knight Returns, read The Killing Joke,

154
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,280
works that presented characters as flawed but real

155
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,720
and used even desks as characterization and world-building,

156
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,920
works that had, to put it in one word, ideas.

157
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,120
But these creators didn't see that stuff when they read those comics.

158
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,480
They saw the darkness, the edginess, the grittiness on the surface

159
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
and tried desperately to recreate that.

160
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,600
The appearance of depth mattered more than the real stuff.

161
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Todd and Rob's company literally called itself Image Comics,

162
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,720
which I feel is a really ironic name

163
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,160
given their obsession with looking interesting without actually being it.

164
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,120
This character they're designing shows up in McFarlane's Spawn comics,

165
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
as Overt Kill.

166
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,280
Yeah, they called it that.

167
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,080
Comics pioneered the expanded universe concept,

168
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,200
finding new ways to tack more things for you to spend money on

169
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,120
onto initially decent ideas.

170
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,840
Now you're now doing an X Factor book, I believe.

171
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,800
X-Force.

172
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,360
X-Force?

173
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,680
Yeah.

174
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,320
X-Force, that's right.

175
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,360
Everyone confuses them.

176
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
F-Factor Force, man.

177
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,680
How many X-Books do we have?

178
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
I think there's, like, eight, ten now.

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,720
I mean, everything.

180
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,640
They got, they got, there's the team books

181
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,320
and then each member of the team has their own book.

182
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,120
So, yeah, people get all confused all the time.

183
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,200
There used to be one X-Men book and one Spider-Man book.

184
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,440
Yeah.

185
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,680
And there's five Spider-Mans and there's five X-Men, so...

186
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,240
When we get a good thing, we don't let it go.

187
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
That's right, no.

188
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,760
But with stories as complete, self-contained,

189
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,640
and final as The Dark Knight Returns or Watchmen,

190
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,760
they couldn't do that.

191
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,640
They had to recreate the tone in other stories.

192
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
It took decades for them to finally say,

193
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,040
fuck it and make needless prequels to Watchmen

194
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,760
and for Frank Miller to so utterly lose his mind

195
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,000
that he decided to make The Dark Knight Rides again,

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
a comic which seems to have forgotten

197
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,480
that Batman being kind of fascist was a bad thing.

198
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,760
With all that out of the way,

199
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,800
what makes the movie adaptation of this comic so bad?

200
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Well, to start off with,

201
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,560
the first 28 minutes have nothing to do with the killing joke.

202
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,920
They're purely focused on Barbara and her relationship with Bruce.

203
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,320
Things come to a head with the stuff I already mentioned

204
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,440
and then she quits.

205
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
It's a little more than padding

206
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,800
because the killing joke is too singular and short

207
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,600
to be easily forced into the narrative of a full feature.

208
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,760
The last moments of Barbara being Batgirl

209
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,840
are used as uninteresting filler.

210
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,680
Which in a way is kind of fitting, isn't it?

211
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,560
And reflects how Batgirl was treated in general in the comics

212
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
and the reason why she came to be viewed

213
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,640
as narratively expendable in the first place.

214
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
I could talk at length here

215
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
about how the killing or serious injuring

216
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,640
of female characters for easy dramatic effect

217
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,520
is a problem that has and continues to plague comics.

218
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,200
But if you need me to say

219
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,160
that comics have a history of bizarre treatment of female characters,

220
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,840
you probably already think I'm wrong

221
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,480
and comics don't need to have characters relatable to women

222
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,320
because half the planet's disposable income

223
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,600
is apparently not worth having.

224
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
And everyone who already knows this

225
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,440
doesn't need to be told again by me.

226
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
So why bother?

227
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
Needless to say though,

228
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,600
Barbara getting shot and paralyzed

229
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
and then literally objectified

230
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,800
in order to hurt her father's feelings

231
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,360
is, while well done and genuinely shocking,

232
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,920
still weirdly cliche for Alan Moore.

233
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,120
It's also probably worth mentioning

234
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,960
that even Alan Moore has his misgivings

235
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
about the killing joke at this point.

236
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,440
Probably the work of mine that I'm least fond of

237
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,800
because there's a lot of nasty things happening in that

238
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,920
and Brian Bolland did a wonderful job on the artwork

239
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,000
but, um, as for my writing,

240
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,080
no, that's not one of my finest hours.

241
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,000
So if you're planning on leaving a comment

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,360
talking about how wrong it is

243
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,400
to criticize such a masterpiece magic comic in comic history

244
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,920
and Alan Moore's a genius,

245
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,440
well, maybe listen to what Alan Moore has to say about it nowadays

246
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,520
if you think he's so fucking smart, you piece of shit.

247
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,120
The new opening section has Barbara doing voiceover for some reason.

248
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,920
I don't know why and I don't really see what it adds.

249
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,320
I really was done with that part of my life.

250
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,800
A week later, it wouldn't matter anyway.

251
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,200
A terrible storm was moving in

252
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
and we'd all be in for it by then.

253
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,920
Oh, a storm's coming in.

254
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,040
How fucking deep.

255
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh, oh, let me tell you about the weather.

256
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,120
My name's Packer.

257
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,600
Having sex with Bruce and having mixed feelings about it

258
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
and feeling bad for taking those feelings out on a criminal

259
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,320
are attempts to give the character some issues

260
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,840
to really grapple with

261
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,720
and I wish I could say I at least appreciate these attempts

262
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,360
but it's just not very good or original.

263
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,720
Depth comes from within,

264
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,840
from the ideas that a writer wants to impose on a story.

265
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,520
It doesn't spurt from the wounds of your enemies or Batman's dick.

266
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,640
These complexities are raised and then she quits and gets shot.

267
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,480
So what was the point in even raising them?

268
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,840
It also adds a post-credits scene setting up that she becomes Oracle.

269
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,400
Ooh, one day something interesting might happen.

270
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,360
That was worth watching a fucking entire film for.

271
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,320
I could stop right here because an adaptation of a very good work

272
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,200
opening with 28 minutes of bad unrelated filler

273
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,320
is usually enough of a deal-breaker, critically speaking.

274
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,720
There's a reason The Killing Joke opened where it did

275
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,040
and not with pages and pages of bullshit

276
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,160
but even the real thing is adapted poorly once it starts.

277
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,280
Remember the receptionist's desk I waxed lyrically about for like five whole minutes?

278
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,880
The desk here is empty.

279
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,080
It's a desk with a computer on it.

280
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,440
It's like a flat plane.

281
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,760
This film is the new textbook case of a bad adaptation of a comic for me now.

282
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,160
It starts with nearly 30 minutes of pointless fluff

283
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,800
and then when the story starts all the actual stuff that made it worth adapting is gone.

284
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,240
It's like they didn't even understand why The Killing Joke worked so well

285
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,240
by being a story that was very careful with particulars and mundanities.

286
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,760
So when you turn the page and the Joker is now shooting Barbara,

287
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
it's sudden and shocking.

288
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,760
The comic uses the bars of a cell to separate both sides of Harvey Dent

289
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,920
and in this comic each side looks a little bit like Batman and the Joker

290
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
setting up the dynamic of the story.

291
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,440
Gordon tries to push past quickly but when he realizes Harvey's watching him,

292
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,240
he can't help but look back at his old friend as he passes.

293
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,680
It sets up how once good people really can just go insane

294
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,880
which I don't know is maybe kind of the point of the fucking story.

295
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,000
In the animated movie, oh look there's a coin.

296
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,360
Remember the coin?

297
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,760
He dropped his coin through the bars of his cell somehow

298
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,680
and Gordon just walks past.

299
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,600
If I was going to adapt The Killing Joke,

300
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,920
the one thing I would definitely think to flesh out

301
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,280
was to build on this moment where Gordon is looking back at a man

302
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,480
who he later might just have ended up becoming

303
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,040
after being subjected to the Joker's torment.

304
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,080
This adaptation un-fleshes out the characters.

305
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,680
It takes out character that the original comic had.

306
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,040
It's kind of amazing that they managed to adapt a comic so badly

307
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,160
that they added half an hour of pointless filler to pad for time

308
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,200
while taking out the most interesting parts.

309
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,680
Is this the Joker's real trick to, you know,

310
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,080
piss off and troll fans of Batman by adapting a comic so poorly?

311
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,800
The flashbacks into the Joker's potential past used very precise colors

312
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
highlighting seemingly random objects

313
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,040
as everything else is silhouetted in darkness and noirish black and white.

314
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,160
Usually there's something that would form a very big piece of a person's memory

315
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,840
like the smell of a shrimp

316
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,240
or the tint of the red hood that covers his face

317
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,360
and plays a part in the metaphorical coloring of his worldview.

318
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,880
The Killing Joke movie just uses semi-muted colors

319
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,320
which is THE generic flashback-looking effect, isn't it?

320
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
And the really striking cuts between memory and reality

321
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,800
that were stark and direct and shockingly personal

322
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,040
for such a seemingly insane character?

323
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,000
In this, it just fades to a random shot of the Joker

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,280
with his hand against a glass looking incredibly dopey.

325
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Seriously, what even is that face?

326
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,800
What emotion is trying to be conveyed here?

327
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,360
Who drew this? Did they commission Rob Liefeld to draw this?

328
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
What the f—what?

329
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,040
I bet if you search DeviantArt you'll find—

330
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,120
you'll find a better drawing of this exact moment than in this movie.

331
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,200
Although the Joker will probably be fully nude

332
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,480
but that doesn't really detract from the emotions of the scene, I feel.

333
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
And in the climactic showdown

334
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,080
where the Joker suddenly pulls an earnest face

335
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,600
and you realize that what he really wants

336
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,160
is to prove to someone else that his perspective is correct

337
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,320
so that he can finally feel justified in it

338
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,560
and maybe because Batman isn't responding

339
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,320
he has to consider he's wrong?

340
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,520
Like Gordon, he's trying to show Batman his way works

341
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,120
and Batman doesn't believe him.

342
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,400
For a moment, even his faith in his beliefs is shaken.

343
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,360
It's at that moment that Batman appears and attacks him,

344
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,160
seemingly a manifestation of the Joker's own self-doubt.

345
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,280
Why aren't you laughing?

346
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,040
In the movie, he's just saying these lines as he has a punch fight with Batman.

347
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,160
Apparently, the Hall of Mirrors scene wasn't weird and cool enough

348
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,920
for the creators of this adaptation.

349
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,200
They had to have an extra section

350
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,080
where Batman and the Joker fight in a recreation of his apartment

351
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,680
but with the furniture glued to the ceiling

352
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,920
because his life was flipped turn upside down

353
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,080
and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,

354
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,440
I'll tell you all about how I became the clown prince of crime!

355
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,920
The writer behind the adaptation, Brian Azzarello,

356
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,240
is also the guy who wrote some of those Watchmen prequels

357
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,280
I talked about earlier.

358
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,960
Between this and the 30-minute opening,

359
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
it appears he specializes in the production

360
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,000
of needless preamble to actually good stories,

361
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,240
which is a shame because I remember really liking

362
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,600
what I read of A Hundred Bullets

363
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,920
and his run on Wonder Woman is apparently really good,

364
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,600
though I could never bring myself to read it

365
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
because they're the best superhero

366
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
and I don't go out of my way to read things

367
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,560
I expect to disappoint me?

368
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm not that kind of masochist.

369
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,480
Please don't kink shame!

370
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,720
To put it simply, the Killing Joke movie's real problem

371
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,880
isn't poor writing or low-budget animation,

372
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,760
but don't get me wrong, it has a fucking trowel full of that.

373
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Its central issue is the same problem

374
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,800
all the stories that aped the original comic so badly had.

375
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,240
It's THE problem,

376
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,880
the one that's plagued comic history for all time,

377
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,200
the endless commodification of good work

378
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,080
but in a manner that renders its copies devoid of meaning,

379
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,120
sold based on the mere resemblance to that good stuff.

380
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,280
All these problems have finally come home to roost

381
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
within the fabric of the Killing Joke itself

382
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,280
in the form of this lazy, cash-in adaptation 25 years later.

383
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,680
Like with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns before it,

384
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,240
it's been transformed into an expanded universe,

385
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,080
coming attached with its very own vestigial, worthless prequel,

386
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,720
and all its beautiful imagery has been stripped away.

387
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,160
The art is quite literally gone from The Killing Joke.

388
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,800
You see what those bloody corporations do?

389
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,520
They take your ideas and they suck them.

390
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,880
Suck them like leeches

391
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,960
until they've gotten every last drop of the marrow from your bones.

392
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,320
While it could be dismissed as garbage to be left by the wayside,

393
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
what makes it worth looking at

394
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,880
is how emblematic it is of all these wider problems.

395
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,600
Accidentally, it's the ultimate modern demonstration

396
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,680
of the problem with comics.

397
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,640
At least until one of Rob Liefeld's comics gets an adaptation.

398
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
Ah, I hope they adapt the arc

399
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,840
where sex death orchestrates her own murder

400
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,280
to hurt Strongshot's feelings

401
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,120
and he puts valiant comics out of business

402
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,880
by refusing to work for 12 months.
