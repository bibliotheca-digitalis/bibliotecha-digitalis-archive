0	1880	So the Killing Joke movie came out.
1880	6220	Great! Adaptations of Alan Moore's work. They've never been bad.
6320	10060	Bwaaaahpahpahpapapapapapahpahpah!
10060	12140	Papapapa! Papapapa!
13980	17020	Ha! What is that sound effect?
17620	18120	What?
19580	20740	Ha ha ha ha!
20740	22220	What the fuck is that?
22220	24220	Okay, so it's not very good. It's not very good at all.
24600	28360	Most fans of Batman or Batgirl at this point know that it adds, among other things,
28760	31800	a scene where Barbara and Bruce have explicit sexual tension,
31800	33240	followed by sex,
33240	34760	followed by awkwardness,
34760	38920	followed by Barbara taking out these feelings on a criminal by beating them completely senseless,
38920	40200	followed by her quitting.
40200	42200	It's lazy, and it's poorly written,
42760	44040	and it's boring.
44040	47320	But before we can really get into how and why
47320	51320	Batman, colon, The Killing Joke, colon, the 2016 film is so bad,
51320	53720	and at least learn a lesson of some kind from it,
53720	55880	we have to talk about the comic industry.
55960	60520	We have to talk about Batman, colon, The Killing Joke, colon, the 1988 comic.
60520	63400	And we have to talk at least a little bit about Alan Moore,
63400	66520	also known as the Rasputin of the comics industry,
66520	68280	because he has a huge beard,
68280	69480	will never die,
69480	71480	and killed comics.
74840	78360	Okay, when I said Alan Moore killed comics, I probably ought to qualify that.
78360	81240	It's more that in the 90s, comics committed suicide,
81240	83160	and it was Alan who handed them the rope.
83160	85800	Moore is critically acclaimed for a very good reason,
85800	88440	and in the mid to late 80s, he, along with Neil Gaiman,
88440	90680	Art Spiegelman, Mark Waid, Garth Ennis,
90680	93480	Frank Miller, in the brief period when he was properly medicated,
93480	96520	and a good half dozen others formed a cabal of excellent writers
96520	99400	that collectively ruined comics for the rest of time.
99400	101080	No, seriously, for a second.
101080	103240	These writers are good, and that's great.
103240	105160	Their work read well and did well critically,
105160	107800	but unfortunately, it also sold well.
107800	110440	And art doesn't make the comics industry go round.
111000	112200	Money does.
112200	114440	And everyone wanted a piece of the pie.
114440	116760	Everyone wanted to make the next Watchmen,
116760	118920	to do Dark Knight Returns' numbers,
118920	121240	and everyone thought they knew exactly how best
121240	124760	to imitate those works and themselves create a timeless piece of art.
124760	127800	So for every gritty but thoughtful and interesting look at Batman,
127800	130760	or every well-explored morally ambiguous Rorschach,
130760	133080	or every cool moment that Wolverine did,
133080	134840	there would be Cable,
134840	135960	Cardiac,
135960	137080	Lady Blaze,
137080	138280	Death Watch, Dream Slayer,
138280	139720	Forearm, Whiplash,
139720	140760	Wild Side,
140760	141720	Zero, Ajax,
141720	142680	Bloody Mary,
144600	145080	Crippler,
145080	145800	Siege,
145800	146360	D.Vos,
146360	147080	The Devastator,
147080	147720	Gormonarch,
147720	148280	Shatterstar,
148280	148760	Bad Rock,
148760	149560	Shagger,
149560	149960	Blood,
150840	151560	Die Hard,
151560	152040	Sentinel,
152040	153480	Troll Wolverine,
153480	154040	Prophet,
154040	154680	Knight,
154680	155320	Sabre,
155320	155880	Photon,
155880	156360	Brahma,
156360	156920	Cross,
156920	157480	TASK?!
157480	158360	WHAT?!
158360	158680	WHAT?!
158680	159800	Wildmane,
159800	161160	Wolverine,
161160	162600	Warwolf-erine,
163640	164360	Warblade,
164360	165480	Wildstar,
165480	167160	Ripclaw-verine,
167160	167960	Deadlock,
167960	168920	Strongarm,
168920	170200	Mrs. Sexdeath,
170680	172360	Strongshot,
172360	173480	Deadblast,
174280	176520	Smash Beef,
176520	178360	and Settlers of Catan.
178360	180840	Those early comics were good because they were unique.
180840	182200	They were nuanced.
182200	187640	This early panel in the Killing Joke highlights the attempts at levity from the people who work in Arkham Asylum.
187640	192040	It also sets up that in order to really deal with the bullshit of the people who end up there,
192040	194440	you probably have to be a little insane yourself,
194440	196120	the point being that Batman,
196120	200040	the guy with parental issues who dresses up as a bat while he's getting people put in there,
200040	202360	might have some issues to explore himself.
202360	205800	A little jokey sign on a table sets up the story's themes,
205800	208760	but also the characters of the story and their attitudes.
208760	213560	Alan Moore was famous for writing pages and pages of descriptions for everything in his panels for the artist,
213560	215720	the stuff on their desks and what it says about them,
215720	217560	the quality of the motes of light,
217560	219640	stuff the artist probably would never actually draw,
219640	223720	but which perfectly set the mood for the artist to then get across how they see fit.
223720	226040	If you want to know what makes a great comic work,
226040	227480	don't just look at the basic plot,
227480	228680	the important monologues,
228680	229560	the writing,
229640	230360	as it were.
230360	234600	Look at the desks and bookcases and bedside tables of Moore's world.
234600	236120	That's the real writing.
236120	238040	And then flip through a copy of, say,
238040	240680	Youngblood and look at how barren everything is.
240680	245080	These comics are supposedly set in a grimdark world where heroes are antiheroes,
245080	247880	but quite often they simply just tell you that
247880	251560	and then show you shots of characters monologuing about how complex they are
251560	255080	in empty characterless rooms or just straight-up blank voids.
257080	259000	This comic is drawn by Rob Liefeld.
259000	263720	He's a bad artist and a bad writer and bad, bad, bad!
263720	265880	And everything wrong with comics in the 90s.
265880	268520	Here's Rob and Todd McFarlane designing a character from scratch
268520	271000	during the taping of a show Stan Lee used to do.
271000	273160	But I highly recommend you watch the whole thing for yourself.
273160	273960	It's on YouTube.
273960	277720	It's very informative about the problem with 90s character design as a whole
277720	282200	because despite ostensibly being 30 minutes of these guys designing a character,
282200	284920	no designing actually happens.
284920	287160	Stanny Boy gives them the name Overkill,
287160	289240	and Rob, seemingly on autopilot,
289240	292680	begins making a variation of Cable, one of his other characters.
292680	295400	-"Over there, right?" -"He's gotta be a guy. He's gotta be huge."
296280	298600	-"Thick neck, broad shoulders." -"Thickest neck. Thickest shoulders."
298600	300680	-"Are you gonna give him the usual shoulder pads?"
300680	303480	-"Uh, I don't know. I'm not real sure yet. What do you think, Todd?"
303480	307720	-"I don't know. A Liefeld character without shoulder pads is almost naked.
307720	310680	How would you say that his personality would be different
310680	315000	from most of our other tough guys, like Wolverine and all the others?
316040	316600	And Cable?"
316600	320200	-"See, somehow, like, he's a half-man, half-machine.
320200	322760	He's, you know, fighting that inside.
322760	325480	He's partly a cyborg.
325480	330600	You know, he's a combination of technology and brutality."
330600	331000	-"All right."
334120	337640	Cable was conceived by Liefeld as a darker, edgier X-Man
337640	340440	to lead a new team into the era of gritty comics,
340440	344840	a repackaged collection of tropes pioneered in the good comics of the late 80s.
344840	348760	But Cable himself got so popular that during the taping of this show a year later,
348760	352760	Rob was already cannibalizing his own work, never mind everyone else's.
352760	357000	And unfortunately, during his heyday, he never bothered to learn how to draw the feet.
357000	361480	These kinds of creators read Watchmen, read The Dark Knight Returns, read The Killing Joke,
361480	364280	works that presented characters as flawed but real
364280	367720	and used even desks as characterization and world-building,
367720	370920	works that had, to put it in one word, ideas.
370920	374120	But these creators didn't see that stuff when they read those comics.
374120	377480	They saw the darkness, the edginess, the grittiness on the surface
377480	379720	and tried desperately to recreate that.
379720	382600	The appearance of depth mattered more than the real stuff.
382600	385800	Todd and Rob's company literally called itself Image Comics,
385800	387720	which I feel is a really ironic name
387720	391160	given their obsession with looking interesting without actually being it.
391160	394120	This character they're designing shows up in McFarlane's Spawn comics,
394200	396200	as Overt Kill.
396200	398280	Yeah, they called it that.
398280	401080	Comics pioneered the expanded universe concept,
401080	404200	finding new ways to tack more things for you to spend money on
404200	406120	onto initially decent ideas.
406120	408840	Now you're now doing an X Factor book, I believe.
408840	409800	X-Force.
409800	410360	X-Force?
410360	410680	Yeah.
410680	411320	X-Force, that's right.
411320	412360	Everyone confuses them.
412360	413320	F-Factor Force, man.
413320	414680	How many X-Books do we have?
414680	417000	I think there's, like, eight, ten now.
417000	417720	I mean, everything.
417720	419640	They got, they got, there's the team books
419640	421320	and then each member of the team has their own book.
421320	424120	So, yeah, people get all confused all the time.
424120	426200	There used to be one X-Men book and one Spider-Man book.
426200	426440	Yeah.
426440	428680	And there's five Spider-Mans and there's five X-Men, so...
429400	431240	When we get a good thing, we don't let it go.
431240	432360	That's right, no.
432360	434760	But with stories as complete, self-contained,
434760	437640	and final as The Dark Knight Returns or Watchmen,
437640	438760	they couldn't do that.
438760	441640	They had to recreate the tone in other stories.
441640	443560	It took decades for them to finally say,
443560	446040	fuck it and make needless prequels to Watchmen
446040	448760	and for Frank Miller to so utterly lose his mind
448760	451000	that he decided to make The Dark Knight Rides again,
451000	452520	a comic which seems to have forgotten
452520	455480	that Batman being kind of fascist was a bad thing.
455480	456760	With all that out of the way,
456760	459800	what makes the movie adaptation of this comic so bad?
459800	460680	Well, to start off with,
460680	463560	the first 28 minutes have nothing to do with the killing joke.
463560	466920	They're purely focused on Barbara and her relationship with Bruce.
466920	469320	Things come to a head with the stuff I already mentioned
469320	470440	and then she quits.
470440	471640	It's a little more than padding
471640	473800	because the killing joke is too singular and short
473800	476600	to be easily forced into the narrative of a full feature.
476600	478760	The last moments of Barbara being Batgirl
478760	480840	are used as uninteresting filler.
480840	482680	Which in a way is kind of fitting, isn't it?
482680	485560	And reflects how Batgirl was treated in general in the comics
485560	487240	and the reason why she came to be viewed
487240	489640	as narratively expendable in the first place.
489640	491080	I could talk at length here
491080	493560	about how the killing or serious injuring
493560	495640	of female characters for easy dramatic effect
495640	498520	is a problem that has and continues to plague comics.
498520	500200	But if you need me to say
500200	503160	that comics have a history of bizarre treatment of female characters,
503160	504840	you probably already think I'm wrong
504840	507480	and comics don't need to have characters relatable to women
507480	509320	because half the planet's disposable income
509320	510600	is apparently not worth having.
510600	512200	And everyone who already knows this
512200	514440	doesn't need to be told again by me.
514440	515880	So why bother?
515880	517080	Needless to say though,
517080	518600	Barbara getting shot and paralyzed
518600	520120	and then literally objectified
520120	521800	in order to hurt her father's feelings
521800	524360	is, while well done and genuinely shocking,
524360	526920	still weirdly cliche for Alan Moore.
526920	528120	It's also probably worth mentioning
528120	529960	that even Alan Moore has his misgivings
529960	531560	about the killing joke at this point.
531560	534440	Probably the work of mine that I'm least fond of
534440	537800	because there's a lot of nasty things happening in that
537800	540920	and Brian Bolland did a wonderful job on the artwork
540920	543000	but, um, as for my writing,
543000	545080	no, that's not one of my finest hours.
545080	547000	So if you're planning on leaving a comment
547000	548360	talking about how wrong it is
548360	553400	to criticize such a masterpiece magic comic in comic history
553400	554920	and Alan Moore's a genius,
554920	558440	well, maybe listen to what Alan Moore has to say about it nowadays
558440	560520	if you think he's so fucking smart, you piece of shit.
560520	564120	The new opening section has Barbara doing voiceover for some reason.
564120	566920	I don't know why and I don't really see what it adds.
567560	569320	I really was done with that part of my life.
570280	571800	A week later, it wouldn't matter anyway.
572680	574200	A terrible storm was moving in
574920	576360	and we'd all be in for it by then.
577480	578920	Oh, a storm's coming in.
578920	580040	How fucking deep.
580040	582920	Oh, oh, let me tell you about the weather.
582920	584120	My name's Packer.
584120	586600	Having sex with Bruce and having mixed feelings about it
586600	589400	and feeling bad for taking those feelings out on a criminal
589400	591320	are attempts to give the character some issues
591320	592840	to really grapple with
592840	595720	and I wish I could say I at least appreciate these attempts
595720	598360	but it's just not very good or original.
598360	599720	Depth comes from within,
599720	602840	from the ideas that a writer wants to impose on a story.
602840	606520	It doesn't spurt from the wounds of your enemies or Batman's dick.
606520	609640	These complexities are raised and then she quits and gets shot.
609640	611480	So what was the point in even raising them?
611480	614840	It also adds a post-credits scene setting up that she becomes Oracle.
614840	617400	Ooh, one day something interesting might happen.
617400	620360	That was worth watching a fucking entire film for.
620360	623320	I could stop right here because an adaptation of a very good work
623320	626200	opening with 28 minutes of bad unrelated filler
626200	629320	is usually enough of a deal-breaker, critically speaking.
629320	631720	There's a reason The Killing Joke opened where it did
631720	634040	and not with pages and pages of bullshit
634040	637160	but even the real thing is adapted poorly once it starts.
637160	642280	Remember the receptionist's desk I waxed lyrically about for like five whole minutes?
642280	643880	The desk here is empty.
644520	647080	It's a desk with a computer on it.
647080	648440	It's like a flat plane.
648440	652760	This film is the new textbook case of a bad adaptation of a comic for me now.
652760	655160	It starts with nearly 30 minutes of pointless fluff
655160	659800	and then when the story starts all the actual stuff that made it worth adapting is gone.
659800	663240	It's like they didn't even understand why The Killing Joke worked so well
663240	667240	by being a story that was very careful with particulars and mundanities.
667240	670760	So when you turn the page and the Joker is now shooting Barbara,
670760	672680	it's sudden and shocking.
672680	676760	The comic uses the bars of a cell to separate both sides of Harvey Dent
676760	680920	and in this comic each side looks a little bit like Batman and the Joker
680920	682920	setting up the dynamic of the story.
682920	686440	Gordon tries to push past quickly but when he realizes Harvey's watching him,
686440	689240	he can't help but look back at his old friend as he passes.
689240	692680	It sets up how once good people really can just go insane
692680	695880	which I don't know is maybe kind of the point of the fucking story.
695880	699000	In the animated movie, oh look there's a coin.
699000	700360	Remember the coin?
700360	704760	He dropped his coin through the bars of his cell somehow
704760	706680	and Gordon just walks past.
706680	708600	If I was going to adapt The Killing Joke,
708600	710920	the one thing I would definitely think to flesh out
710920	714280	was to build on this moment where Gordon is looking back at a man
714280	717480	who he later might just have ended up becoming
717480	720040	after being subjected to the Joker's torment.
720040	723080	This adaptation un-fleshes out the characters.
723080	726680	It takes out character that the original comic had.
726680	730040	It's kind of amazing that they managed to adapt a comic so badly
730040	733160	that they added half an hour of pointless filler to pad for time
733160	736200	while taking out the most interesting parts.
736200	738680	Is this the Joker's real trick to, you know,
738680	743080	piss off and troll fans of Batman by adapting a comic so poorly?
743080	747800	The flashbacks into the Joker's potential past used very precise colors
747800	749800	highlighting seemingly random objects
749800	754040	as everything else is silhouetted in darkness and noirish black and white.
754040	757160	Usually there's something that would form a very big piece of a person's memory
757160	758840	like the smell of a shrimp
758840	761240	or the tint of the red hood that covers his face
761240	764360	and plays a part in the metaphorical coloring of his worldview.
764360	767880	The Killing Joke movie just uses semi-muted colors
767880	771320	which is THE generic flashback-looking effect, isn't it?
771320	774440	And the really striking cuts between memory and reality
774440	777800	that were stark and direct and shockingly personal
777800	780040	for such a seemingly insane character?
780040	783000	In this, it just fades to a random shot of the Joker
783000	786280	with his hand against a glass looking incredibly dopey.
786280	787720	Seriously, what even is that face?
787720	789800	What emotion is trying to be conveyed here?
789800	792360	Who drew this? Did they commission Rob Liefeld to draw this?
792360	793560	What the f—what?
793560	796040	I bet if you search DeviantArt you'll find—
796040	800120	you'll find a better drawing of this exact moment than in this movie.
800120	802200	Although the Joker will probably be fully nude
802200	805480	but that doesn't really detract from the emotions of the scene, I feel.
805480	806840	And in the climactic showdown
806840	809080	where the Joker suddenly pulls an earnest face
809080	810600	and you realize that what he really wants
810600	813160	is to prove to someone else that his perspective is correct
813160	815320	so that he can finally feel justified in it
815320	817560	and maybe because Batman isn't responding
817560	819320	he has to consider he's wrong?
819320	822520	Like Gordon, he's trying to show Batman his way works
822520	824120	and Batman doesn't believe him.
824120	827400	For a moment, even his faith in his beliefs is shaken.
827400	830360	It's at that moment that Batman appears and attacks him,
830360	833160	seemingly a manifestation of the Joker's own self-doubt.
833960	836280	Why aren't you laughing?
838280	842040	In the movie, he's just saying these lines as he has a punch fight with Batman.
842040	845160	Apparently, the Hall of Mirrors scene wasn't weird and cool enough
845160	846920	for the creators of this adaptation.
846920	848200	They had to have an extra section
848200	851080	where Batman and the Joker fight in a recreation of his apartment
851080	852680	but with the furniture glued to the ceiling
852680	854920	because his life was flipped turn upside down
854920	857080	and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
857080	860440	I'll tell you all about how I became the clown prince of crime!
860440	862920	The writer behind the adaptation, Brian Azzarello,
862920	865240	is also the guy who wrote some of those Watchmen prequels
865240	866280	I talked about earlier.
866280	867960	Between this and the 30-minute opening,
867960	869960	it appears he specializes in the production
869960	873000	of needless preamble to actually good stories,
873000	875240	which is a shame because I remember really liking
875240	876600	what I read of A Hundred Bullets
876600	878920	and his run on Wonder Woman is apparently really good,
878920	880600	though I could never bring myself to read it
880600	882200	because they're the best superhero
882200	884200	and I don't go out of my way to read things
884200	885560	I expect to disappoint me?
885560	887800	I'm not that kind of masochist.
887800	889480	Please don't kink shame!
889480	891720	To put it simply, the Killing Joke movie's real problem
891720	893880	isn't poor writing or low-budget animation,
893880	896760	but don't get me wrong, it has a fucking trowel full of that.
896760	898760	Its central issue is the same problem
898760	901800	all the stories that aped the original comic so badly had.
901800	903240	It's THE problem,
903240	905880	the one that's plagued comic history for all time,
905880	908200	the endless commodification of good work
908200	911080	but in a manner that renders its copies devoid of meaning,
911080	914120	sold based on the mere resemblance to that good stuff.
914120	916280	All these problems have finally come home to roost
916280	918280	within the fabric of the Killing Joke itself
918280	922280	in the form of this lazy, cash-in adaptation 25 years later.
922280	924680	Like with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns before it,
924680	927240	it's been transformed into an expanded universe,
927240	931080	coming attached with its very own vestigial, worthless prequel,
931080	933720	and all its beautiful imagery has been stripped away.
933720	937160	The art is quite literally gone from The Killing Joke.
937240	939800	You see what those bloody corporations do?
939800	942520	They take your ideas and they suck them.
942520	943880	Suck them like leeches
943880	947960	until they've gotten every last drop of the marrow from your bones.
947960	951320	While it could be dismissed as garbage to be left by the wayside,
951320	952760	what makes it worth looking at
952760	955880	is how emblematic it is of all these wider problems.
955880	958600	Accidentally, it's the ultimate modern demonstration
958600	960680	of the problem with comics.
960680	963640	At least until one of Rob Liefeld's comics gets an adaptation.
963640	964760	Ah, I hope they adapt the arc
964760	966840	where sex death orchestrates her own murder
966840	968280	to hurt Strongshot's feelings
968280	970120	and he puts valiant comics out of business
970120	971880	by refusing to work for 12 months.
