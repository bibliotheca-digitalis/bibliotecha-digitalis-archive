0	5880	You're right Carl, linen is expensive and we should kill all the white people, which
5880	11240	is what this book says. Oh hello! I didn't see you there. Today we're going to watch
11240	15240	the new Ghostbusters trailer. I'm sure it'll be great!
15240	22240	Oh yeah, of course. Sorry. Alright, this time.
30000	37000	Aaron, no one's home.
51360	58360	For too long, the real heroes of culture have sat idly by and let feminism destroy everything
59360	66360	great about society. But with this Ghostbusters trailer, it's time to fight back. You can
67840	73920	tell it's feminist because there's wombs in it. What's next? The Stay Puft Marshmallow
73920	80920	woman? They're taking our movies and our video games and soon there'll be nothing left. Busting
81560	88560	used to make us all feel good. But now, now I'm lonely. I'm lonely and it's everyone else's
89320	96320	fault. But what are we supposed to do about it? Who are we going to telephone?
96320	103320	Oh hey. What's all this then? Oh I'm doing an over the top satirical parody of the people
104320	111320	who think the Ghostbusters trailer is destroying the world. Yeah well, the thing about that
111360	117200	is, MRAs and anti-feminists have gotten so ridiculous at this point that it's almost
117200	122360	indistinguishable from parody. It's impossible to do. I mean, not even Roosh knows which
122360	126160	of his articles are satire anymore. You know that's actually a really good point, isn't
126160	133160	it? This is stupid. We'll do it the normal way. Come on Mort.
134160	139160	Oh god. Man, that would have been a really stupid gimmick to do in a whole video, right?
139160	145880	Hey, wait, hold on. I think you dropped this! Luckily you don't need me to tell you the
145880	150920	trailer's bad. You can go and watch it. Or any of the hundred million people who already
150920	157920	watched it and reacted to it. But whatever, you know, it's a bad trailer. It doesn't...
158400	165400	It doesn't mean feminists have destroyed Ghostbusters. Feminism is going to destroy Ghostbusters!
168400	172840	Stop it. We already agreed we're not doing this. Oh really? You know we'd have to pay
172840	178200	extra to express ship this hat, right? Oh no, we bought a cheap ass fedora on eBay.
178200	185200	It's a trilby! How dare you! What's more important to me is showcasing one of, if not the greatest
186200	192200	overreactions to a bad trailer in film history. I'm talking, of course, about Thunderf00t.
192200	198200	Yeah, the Ghostbusters. This time it's a progressive politically correct chick flick.
198200	204200	Thunderf00t, shown here failing to debate noted creationist moron Eric Hovin so badly
204200	209520	his best rebuttals consist of calling him a retard in post, knows the truth. Feminism
209520	216520	is a threat to Ghostbusters. He's also notable, of course, for making videos about, for example,
217360	222600	a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman
222600	226680	he thinks is wrong, and a different woman he thinks is wrong. Oh, and a couple dozen
226680	231080	more about that first woman, just to make sure you know she's wrong. You know, the ground
231080	234920	has to be properly covered. She's wrong. Did I make that clear enough? Okay, no, maybe
234920	239840	a couple more. There we go. Now we can put it to rest and rant about the new Ghostbuster
239840	245440	film. It's Ghostbusters, but that's fine. Sure, get the name of the film wrong. That
245440	250000	doesn't impact your argument at all. Thunderf00t appears to have a problem with this picture
250000	255200	taken on set because, you see, yeah, it's a bunch of privileged middle-class women who
255200	260680	think that merely having a certain set of sexual organs makes them special. However,
260680	266960	these women don't actually realize that taking a picture where you've deliberately and completely
266960	273560	excluded people by their sex is kind of archetypal sexism. Not only—
273560	278200	Oh, how exclusionary. There's no men in this picture. Oh, yeah, that's the real problem.
278200	283400	Not the seemingly systematic exclusion of women from working on film sets or anything.
283400	289880	You know, makes you think, who are the real sexists? Answer, these women. Look how happy
289960	297960	they are to have jobs. You are parasites on other people's creativity and their grammar,
297960	302600	apparently. Help, the feminists have attached themselves to my veins and they're drawing
302600	316200	out my ability to spell and type. Why weren't there men in this picture? Where are the men?
316200	323800	It's the sort of crazy lack of self-awareness that allows you to pronounce that 100% of white people are racists,
323800	326840	but black people can't be racist.
326840	331560	Wait, why is he cutting to a clip from CBSN? What does this have to do with Ghostbuster?
331560	339720	Oh, I get it. He thinks this person saying something stupid on TV is somehow representative of feminism as a whole.
341240	345800	Really? Is that—is that the shit he's pulling? Is he really pulling that? Is this not a joke?
345800	349960	Because this argument is about as stupid as it would be to use the time Thunderf00t didn't
349960	355080	have a very good debate with Eric Hovind as proof that all atheists are bad at debates.
355880	359240	Is it impossible? Is it an absolute impossibility for God to exist?
360120	369720	There is, uh, when you say, is it impossible, um, it is a malformed question.
370520	372840	Can you un-ask a bad question, please?
375000	379400	This is why atheism doesn't look credible to so many people, because when asked a really
379400	384920	straight-up question, the answer is, uh, um, the question is wrong.
386840	391160	Oh, God. I mean, no, no, sorry, I can't say that because there isn't one.
391160	396200	About 36 minutes into the video, Thunderf00t declares victory and tries to run away,
396200	400680	presumably in the hopes that he can edit the video enough to make it look like he really did win.
400680	404520	Instead, he just settled on calling him a retard over and over, which, as we know,
404520	406520	is basically proof that you're right.
406520	411240	Hovind stops him by asking perhaps the easiest question a human has ever been asked.
412120	413720	Is everybody's reasoning valid?
414440	419320	Oh, I can see the cogs turning. Is everybody's reasoning valid? What's his answer gonna be?
419320	425720	We are humans. We have the same genome. Everyone here has more or less the same genome.
425720	429560	Oh, he waffles for, like, a straight minute about how humans have brains.
430200	432920	I mean, that's almost an answer to the question.
432920	437320	A better answer would be no, but his was good, too.
437320	440680	I guess I just don't have the quick-thinking skills he does.
440680	443720	Even when he's right, this guy's bad at arguing.
443720	446760	I'm beginning to have some sympathy for creationism he's so bad.
446840	448840	Ah-ha!
448840	451400	Logical fallacy! That's a logical fallacy!
451400	453480	You can't, just because someone's bad at arguing,
453480	456680	doesn't make their argument wrong or someone else's argument right.
456680	461720	That's correct, my joke was technically fallacious, but it was also a joke.
462680	465560	No, you have to unsay it now, because if not,
465560	469480	I'll send my army of followers to pick apart that one joke you made
469480	472600	and ignore the actual point of the video.
472600	475400	I'm doing you a favor, unsay it now!
475400	477160	Okay, you know what? Fine, I will.
477160	480920	That was an initial confusion, but I think now we've got an answer to the question.
480920	481640	Are you happy?
482520	483960	Do I look happy to you?
485560	492600	Everywhere I look, even in trailers for science fiction comedy films,
494200	498840	I see feminists trying to take over and force their agenda down our throats.
498840	502840	I see feminists trying to take over and force their agenda down our throats.
503800	506440	And this is somehow everyone else's fault, but mine.
507560	508600	I'm so rational.
511480	512200	I'm rational!
513960	516120	This is what a patriarch looks like.
517400	521160	So, so far, Thunderf00t's two biggest problems with the new Ghostbusters film
521160	524040	is that there weren't any men in a picture taken to celebrate
524040	525960	how many women were working on the film,
525960	530440	and that this guy on an unrelated TV broadcast said something stupid.
530440	532600	Oh, I smell a Razzie already.
532600	535160	If you celebrate the difference in gender ratio
535160	538200	from the production staff on your film to another film,
538200	543320	that's basically the same as demanding people respect your vagina.
543320	545080	It's literally the same thing.
545080	549960	No, wait, I'm sure he's getting his actual reasoning why Ghostbusters is bad soon.
549960	552040	I mean, we're only, you know, halfway through.
552840	555160	I mean, you recall a while back.
555160	556920	Anita Sarkeesian, pitch this-
561320	563960	Even this video is about Anita Sarkeesian.
564760	566920	He can never stop talking about her.
570840	572520	Ghostbusters is bad.
572520	575000	Let me tell you about Anita.
575000	577640	Didn't she make this video in, like, 2013?
578440	580200	I mean, what the fuck?
580280	583080	Thunderf00t spends literally half this video-
583080	586280	Which, let me remind you, was supposed to be about Ghostbusters.
586280	588200	laboring this basic point.
588200	593160	One, Anita Sarkeesian proposed a game idea as a thought experiment in 2013.
593160	596040	Two, Anita Sarkeesian didn't actually make this game
596040	598840	because Anita Sarkeesian makes videos for the internet.
598840	603720	Therefore, she secretly thinks that idea was full of shit and wouldn't be profitable,
603720	608280	and therefore, feminist criticism itself is all garbage.
608800	609320	Um.
609320	612280	She was so confident that this game would be successful
612280	616920	that she spent not one cent of her almost million dollars of funding
616920	619480	trying to make this into a game.
619480	621880	And that's why Ghostbusters is-
625080	629400	It's a damn sight easier to be a critic than a creator.
629400	631880	Thunderf00t then cuts to some of the experiments he's done
631880	633640	as if, in order to criticize art,
633640	638120	you have to have done science experiments in an unrelated field of study.
638200	638920	It's okay.
638920	641400	Thunderf00t's allowed to criticize other people's creative work
641400	642920	because he's done beekeeping.
642920	644440	Where's Anita's bees?
644440	646440	Hashtag where's Anita's bees.
646440	650200	He also spends a good chunk of time regurgitating these memes of Anita Sarkeesian
650200	652680	where they take comments she made about gender signifiers
652680	654680	and character design in fictional media
654680	657320	and twist it to somehow mean that she thinks
657320	659720	real-life women shouldn't wear pink
659720	661240	or dress up at all
661240	662280	or have earrings.
662840	664440	Criticizing women for how they dress.
664440	665720	Oh, how rational!
665720	667640	Because that's what Anita was doing.
667720	671000	Let me remind you that this is a video about Ghostbusters
671000	673000	and half of it is spent complaining
673000	675880	that Anita Sarkeesian sometimes wears pink.
676520	679640	Which is one of the reasons why this girl-powered trailer here
680200	684520	currently has over a third of a million dislikes.
684520	687880	Oh, that's why people didn't like the Ghostbusters trailer.
687880	689000	Thanks, Thunderf00t.
693240	696360	But let's move on to his other video about Ghostbusters.
696360	697720	Yeah, he made two.
697720	699880	Because, in the words of Willy Shaxpare,
699880	702440	brevity is the soul of idiots.
702440	704920	Talk forever about things you don't like.
704920	706520	Never stop talking about them.
706520	707640	That'll prove you right.
707640	708680	I'm rational.
708680	710040	I'm rational!
710040	712120	Sexual harassment isn't a big deal.
712120	713400	It's not a big deal!
713400	714440	It's not a big deal!
714440	715160	AAAAAAAA
715160	717480	This video's even better because he starts to complain
717480	719800	not just about the fact woms are in the film
719800	724440	and inexplicably claiming they think having a vagina makes them special
724440	727800	but he even stops to get upset about the production design.
728680	732200	Women who grow tall have trouble getting radiation warning signs.
732200	734360	Just put a little heart in the middle of them
734360	736360	because, you know, chick flick.
739560	740280	You see?
740280	743400	It's feminist because they drew a heart on the proton pack.
744920	747880	That's not even what hearts look like in real life.
747880	749240	They're not even pink.
749240	749740	You see?
751240	752360	Men have hearts too.
753320	757480	This is an unrealistic depiction of anatomy
757480	760280	which is what Ghostbusters is all about after all.
760840	762040	God, I'm so rational.
762600	766360	He even takes the time to recast feminists criticizing the trailer
766360	769160	as proof that feminism is eating itself.
769160	773640	Oh god, I love the bloodbath when the progressive stack
773640	777160	intersectional social justice warriors eat each other.
777160	779480	Oh yeah, it's really a bloodbath.
779480	783240	I really was not pleased with the way that Leslie Jones was portrayed
783240	784200	at least in the trailer.
786600	788040	Feminism is collapsing!
788040	789240	The empire is falling!
789240	790440	Run for your lives!
791240	794280	He also brings up the photograph again a few more times.
794280	798440	Imagine seeing women simply celebrating having a greater level of representation
798440	800920	in a place where statistically they usually don't
800920	802520	and feeling threatened by it
802520	806360	so much so that you have to keep bringing it up across multiple videos.
806440	809480	Thunderf00t's the sort of guy who will criticize a documentary
809480	812840	for being weirdly obsessive about Anita Sarkeesian
812840	816520	while being weirdly obsessive about Anita Sarkeesian
816520	819720	so much so that he agreed to appear in the documentary!
820520	824120	I'm beginning to think the man's a little bit obsessive about this one woman.
824120	824840	Just a little.
824840	825880	Just a little bit.
825880	829400	The great French psychoanalytic theorist Jacques-Louis Lakin
829400	830200	Is that how you pronounce it?
830200	831400	I've done no research.
831400	835880	once claimed that it's possible for a belief or action to be pathological or obsessive
835960	838120	even if the belief is technically accurate.
838120	843000	Let's take for granted for a moment that Anita Sarkeesian really is wrong about everything.
843000	846760	Even her subjective opinions of art are now objectively wrong somehow.
846760	849560	Why, then, does Thunderf00t feel the need
849560	853640	to keep saying she's wrong over and over and over
853640	855720	for literally years?
856920	858280	If she had simply been wrong,
858920	861480	people could have criticized her work and moved on
861480	863880	or just, you know, ignored her.
863880	867720	But instead, even when talking about something completely unrelated
867720	869560	like Ghostbusters,
869560	871480	there's an inescapable need
871480	873640	to mediate it by talking about her.
874280	876200	Imagine if I reviewed the Star Wars trailer
876200	878760	by talking at length about how awful Kevin is.
878760	880040	That piece of shit.
880040	883080	Trying to upstage me with his overly white smile.
883080	886200	He didn't make a video game he had an idea for two years ago.
886200	887160	That wanker.
887160	889720	Why didn't he learn programming and actually make it?
889720	892200	Which is obviously what he said he was going to do.
892840	895000	And that's why Star Wars is bad!
895000	898200	I would seem a little obsessed, wouldn't I?
898200	901480	To Thunderf00t and his followers, or shall we say foot soldiers,
902760	905560	feminism is a singular, monolithic entity
905560	908120	that's out to take away our games and films
908120	912200	and doesn't create anything except for, you know, the film they created
912200	916360	and for whom any particular feminist is so interchangeable with Anita Sarkeesian
916360	919400	that you might as well rant about her instead of the subject at hand.
919960	923000	It's almost silly of me to have chosen Ghostbusters
923000	924760	as my reason to talk about Thunderf00t
924760	928440	because ultimately his videos aren't about Ghostbusters
928440	931480	or even feminists or even Anita Sarkeesian.
932360	933640	They're a two-minute hate,
933640	936520	although Thunderf00t isn't merciful enough to make his videos that short,
937080	940440	directed at the straw man that has been made of Anita Sarkeesian
940440	943720	as some sort of load-bearing icon of feminism
943720	946280	over hours and hours and hours of videos
946280	950760	calling her a lying monster who wants you to respect her vagina.
950760	953320	You know, that thing she famously said.
953320	954120	Ever.
976280	999960	Is this rational?
1000600	1004360	Are Thunderf00t's videos indicative of how to approach any issue in the world?
1005000	1009560	Or is it just easily digestible, self-aggrandizing propaganda?
1010680	1014760	Even Thunderf00t himself occasionally finds himself wondering why,
1015560	1019400	despite making dozens and dozens and dozens of videos on the topic,
1019400	1022040	somehow he hasn't yet destroyed feminism.
1022040	1026920	It's almost as if making videos designed to affirm an audience that they're already right
1026920	1028760	doesn't actually change anyone's mind
1028760	1033240	and won't make a large and diverse school of thought spontaneously evaporate.
1033240	1037320	And that's not even to mention that this isn't the first terrible Ghostbusters trailer.
1037320	1040840	Close to, if not literally none, of the footage Thunderf00t showed
1040840	1043320	when he was trying to demonstrate what made the originals good
1043320	1045320	is in the trailer for the original film.
1045320	1047320	It's edited more like a horror trailer,
1047320	1051880	when Ghostbusters is pretty objectively a sex comedy with mild horror elements.
1051880	1055560	And by mild horror elements, I mean this one scene is pretty scary,
1055560	1057080	and the rest is a comedy.
1057080	1060760	At this point, it's pretty much standard for a Ghostbusters trailer to be bad.
1061720	1065000	In a way, all good films resist being turned into trailers,
1065000	1067080	leaving something missing from them.
1067080	1069320	I'm not saying the new film is going to be good.
1069320	1072440	I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's good or not.
1072440	1076600	I'm saying that having a bad trailer is the most Ghostbusters thing there is.
1077320	1082600	This is, in a kind of paradoxical way, a good sign for the film.
1082600	1083560	At least I hope it is.
1083560	1085800	I like it when films are good, personally.
1085800	1088840	But even then, if it's bad, it's just gonna be a bad film.
1089400	1093000	It's not gonna be proof that the feminists are coming to get us.
1096040	1097640	The feminists are coming to get us!
1098920	1099880	What? Why?
1100440	1104280	They heard this video wasn't going to be enough about how special it is to have a vagina.
1104280	1106840	Which is what feminism is all about, after all.
1106840	1108120	So they're coming to get us!
1108120	1112200	They're gonna tie us down and read the vagina monologues to us until we submit!
1113160	1115400	Have you actually read the vagina monologues?
1115400	1116920	Some of them are actually pretty engaging.
1117000	1117560	Now!
1117560	1118840	There's no time!
1118840	1120120	Take only what's important!
1124680	1125400	Well, I gotta...
1126680	1129320	Well, I better get packing and go on the run again.
1130040	1132440	But first, a word from our Patreon sponsors.
1140120	1141720	If you're wondering why your name isn't here,
1141720	1145080	it's because Patreon doesn't actually charge people's cards until the end of the month,
1145080	1148440	so everyone who joined me this month will get into the credits next time.
1148440	1151720	I promise this isn't some trick to save me from having to write more credits.
1151720	1154280	I'd like to make special thanks to Amanda Beverley,
1154280	1155640	Alexander Corbett,
1155640	1156840	Ciaran Dachtler,
1156840	1158120	Jason Walter,
1158120	1159240	Bob Leonard,
1159240	1160360	Rob Brunt,
1160360	1161400	Jenny Angel,
1161400	1162360	Tyler Jay,
1162360	1166440	and Kevin M. Knippy, who got in touch and told me how to pronounce his name.
1166440	1166940	Thanks.
1167560	1168680	At least I hope that was him.
1169640	1170140	Oh no!
1171800	1174520	If anyone wants a different name in the credits from their Patreon name,
1174520	1175960	feel free to message me and let me know.
1176760	1177720	Thanks for watching.
1177720	1182680	And an extra special thanks to Corwin Light-Williams, whose name I keep spelling wrong.
1183400	1185560	It's really stupid of me.
1185560	1186360	I don't even know how.
1186360	1188520	I spelled it wrong differently twice.
1188520	1189880	I have no idea what's wrong with me.
1192280	1194200	I'm going to take my two most prized possessions,
1194200	1195640	a book I haven't read,
1195640	1200360	and the sword I stole from a Chester Youth Theatre production of Richard III about six years ago.
1200360	1204200	And I know some of you recognize this because I know you follow me on YouTube.
1204440	1205640	I'm going to get the fuck out of here.
1212520	1213020	Shit!
1215080	1215580	There we go.
1215580	1216080	Alright.
