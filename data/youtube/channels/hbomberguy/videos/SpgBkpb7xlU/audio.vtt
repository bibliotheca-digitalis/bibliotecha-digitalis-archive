WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
You're right Carl, linen is expensive and we should kill all the white people, which

00:05.880 --> 00:11.240
is what this book says. Oh hello! I didn't see you there. Today we're going to watch

00:11.240 --> 00:15.240
the new Ghostbusters trailer. I'm sure it'll be great!

00:15.240 --> 00:22.240
Oh yeah, of course. Sorry. Alright, this time.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Aaron, no one's home.

00:51.360 --> 00:58.360
For too long, the real heroes of culture have sat idly by and let feminism destroy everything

00:59.360 --> 01:06.360
great about society. But with this Ghostbusters trailer, it's time to fight back. You can

01:07.840 --> 01:13.920
tell it's feminist because there's wombs in it. What's next? The Stay Puft Marshmallow

01:13.920 --> 01:20.920
woman? They're taking our movies and our video games and soon there'll be nothing left. Busting

01:21.560 --> 01:28.560
used to make us all feel good. But now, now I'm lonely. I'm lonely and it's everyone else's

01:29.320 --> 01:36.320
fault. But what are we supposed to do about it? Who are we going to telephone?

01:36.320 --> 01:43.320
Oh hey. What's all this then? Oh I'm doing an over the top satirical parody of the people

01:44.320 --> 01:51.320
who think the Ghostbusters trailer is destroying the world. Yeah well, the thing about that

01:51.360 --> 01:57.200
is, MRAs and anti-feminists have gotten so ridiculous at this point that it's almost

01:57.200 --> 02:02.360
indistinguishable from parody. It's impossible to do. I mean, not even Roosh knows which

02:02.360 --> 02:06.160
of his articles are satire anymore. You know that's actually a really good point, isn't

02:06.160 --> 02:13.160
it? This is stupid. We'll do it the normal way. Come on Mort.

02:14.160 --> 02:19.160
Oh god. Man, that would have been a really stupid gimmick to do in a whole video, right?

02:19.160 --> 02:25.880
Hey, wait, hold on. I think you dropped this! Luckily you don't need me to tell you the

02:25.880 --> 02:30.920
trailer's bad. You can go and watch it. Or any of the hundred million people who already

02:30.920 --> 02:37.920
watched it and reacted to it. But whatever, you know, it's a bad trailer. It doesn't...

02:38.400 --> 02:45.400
It doesn't mean feminists have destroyed Ghostbusters. Feminism is going to destroy Ghostbusters!

02:48.400 --> 02:52.840
Stop it. We already agreed we're not doing this. Oh really? You know we'd have to pay

02:52.840 --> 02:58.200
extra to express ship this hat, right? Oh no, we bought a cheap ass fedora on eBay.

02:58.200 --> 03:05.200
It's a trilby! How dare you! What's more important to me is showcasing one of, if not the greatest

03:06.200 --> 03:12.200
overreactions to a bad trailer in film history. I'm talking, of course, about Thunderf00t.

03:12.200 --> 03:18.200
Yeah, the Ghostbusters. This time it's a progressive politically correct chick flick.

03:18.200 --> 03:24.200
Thunderf00t, shown here failing to debate noted creationist moron Eric Hovin so badly

03:24.200 --> 03:29.520
his best rebuttals consist of calling him a retard in post, knows the truth. Feminism

03:29.520 --> 03:36.520
is a threat to Ghostbusters. He's also notable, of course, for making videos about, for example,

03:37.360 --> 03:42.600
a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman

03:42.600 --> 03:46.680
he thinks is wrong, and a different woman he thinks is wrong. Oh, and a couple dozen

03:46.680 --> 03:51.080
more about that first woman, just to make sure you know she's wrong. You know, the ground

03:51.080 --> 03:54.920
has to be properly covered. She's wrong. Did I make that clear enough? Okay, no, maybe

03:54.920 --> 03:59.840
a couple more. There we go. Now we can put it to rest and rant about the new Ghostbuster

03:59.840 --> 04:05.440
film. It's Ghostbusters, but that's fine. Sure, get the name of the film wrong. That

04:05.440 --> 04:10.000
doesn't impact your argument at all. Thunderf00t appears to have a problem with this picture

04:10.000 --> 04:15.200
taken on set because, you see, yeah, it's a bunch of privileged middle-class women who

04:15.200 --> 04:20.680
think that merely having a certain set of sexual organs makes them special. However,

04:20.680 --> 04:26.960
these women don't actually realize that taking a picture where you've deliberately and completely

04:26.960 --> 04:33.560
excluded people by their sex is kind of archetypal sexism. Not only—

04:33.560 --> 04:38.200
Oh, how exclusionary. There's no men in this picture. Oh, yeah, that's the real problem.

04:38.200 --> 04:43.400
Not the seemingly systematic exclusion of women from working on film sets or anything.

04:43.400 --> 04:49.880
You know, makes you think, who are the real sexists? Answer, these women. Look how happy

04:49.960 --> 04:57.960
they are to have jobs. You are parasites on other people's creativity and their grammar,

04:57.960 --> 05:02.600
apparently. Help, the feminists have attached themselves to my veins and they're drawing

05:02.600 --> 05:16.200
out my ability to spell and type. Why weren't there men in this picture? Where are the men?

05:16.200 --> 05:23.800
It's the sort of crazy lack of self-awareness that allows you to pronounce that 100% of white people are racists,

05:23.800 --> 05:26.840
but black people can't be racist.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.560
Wait, why is he cutting to a clip from CBSN? What does this have to do with Ghostbuster?

05:31.560 --> 05:39.720
Oh, I get it. He thinks this person saying something stupid on TV is somehow representative of feminism as a whole.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.800
Really? Is that—is that the shit he's pulling? Is he really pulling that? Is this not a joke?

05:45.800 --> 05:49.960
Because this argument is about as stupid as it would be to use the time Thunderf00t didn't

05:49.960 --> 05:55.080
have a very good debate with Eric Hovind as proof that all atheists are bad at debates.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.240
Is it impossible? Is it an absolute impossibility for God to exist?

06:00.120 --> 06:09.720
There is, uh, when you say, is it impossible, um, it is a malformed question.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.840
Can you un-ask a bad question, please?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.400
This is why atheism doesn't look credible to so many people, because when asked a really

06:19.400 --> 06:24.920
straight-up question, the answer is, uh, um, the question is wrong.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.160
Oh, God. I mean, no, no, sorry, I can't say that because there isn't one.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.200
About 36 minutes into the video, Thunderf00t declares victory and tries to run away,

06:36.200 --> 06:40.680
presumably in the hopes that he can edit the video enough to make it look like he really did win.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.520
Instead, he just settled on calling him a retard over and over, which, as we know,

06:44.520 --> 06:46.520
is basically proof that you're right.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.240
Hovind stops him by asking perhaps the easiest question a human has ever been asked.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.720
Is everybody's reasoning valid?

06:54.440 --> 06:59.320
Oh, I can see the cogs turning. Is everybody's reasoning valid? What's his answer gonna be?

06:59.320 --> 07:05.720
We are humans. We have the same genome. Everyone here has more or less the same genome.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.560
Oh, he waffles for, like, a straight minute about how humans have brains.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.920
I mean, that's almost an answer to the question.

07:12.920 --> 07:17.320
A better answer would be no, but his was good, too.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.680
I guess I just don't have the quick-thinking skills he does.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.720
Even when he's right, this guy's bad at arguing.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.760
I'm beginning to have some sympathy for creationism he's so bad.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.840
Ah-ha!

07:28.840 --> 07:31.400
Logical fallacy! That's a logical fallacy!

07:31.400 --> 07:33.480
You can't, just because someone's bad at arguing,

07:33.480 --> 07:36.680
doesn't make their argument wrong or someone else's argument right.

07:36.680 --> 07:41.720
That's correct, my joke was technically fallacious, but it was also a joke.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.560
No, you have to unsay it now, because if not,

07:45.560 --> 07:49.480
I'll send my army of followers to pick apart that one joke you made

07:49.480 --> 07:52.600
and ignore the actual point of the video.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.400
I'm doing you a favor, unsay it now!

07:55.400 --> 07:57.160
Okay, you know what? Fine, I will.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.920
That was an initial confusion, but I think now we've got an answer to the question.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.640
Are you happy?

08:02.520 --> 08:03.960
Do I look happy to you?

08:05.560 --> 08:12.600
Everywhere I look, even in trailers for science fiction comedy films,

08:14.200 --> 08:18.840
I see feminists trying to take over and force their agenda down our throats.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.840
I see feminists trying to take over and force their agenda down our throats.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.440
And this is somehow everyone else's fault, but mine.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.600
I'm so rational.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.200
I'm rational!

08:33.960 --> 08:36.120
This is what a patriarch looks like.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.160
So, so far, Thunderf00t's two biggest problems with the new Ghostbusters film

08:41.160 --> 08:44.040
is that there weren't any men in a picture taken to celebrate

08:44.040 --> 08:45.960
how many women were working on the film,

08:45.960 --> 08:50.440
and that this guy on an unrelated TV broadcast said something stupid.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.600
Oh, I smell a Razzie already.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.160
If you celebrate the difference in gender ratio

08:55.160 --> 08:58.200
from the production staff on your film to another film,

08:58.200 --> 09:03.320
that's basically the same as demanding people respect your vagina.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.080
It's literally the same thing.

09:05.080 --> 09:09.960
No, wait, I'm sure he's getting his actual reasoning why Ghostbusters is bad soon.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.040
I mean, we're only, you know, halfway through.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.160
I mean, you recall a while back.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.920
Anita Sarkeesian, pitch this-

09:21.320 --> 09:23.960
Even this video is about Anita Sarkeesian.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.920
He can never stop talking about her.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.520
Ghostbusters is bad.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.000
Let me tell you about Anita.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.640
Didn't she make this video in, like, 2013?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.200
I mean, what the fuck?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.080
Thunderf00t spends literally half this video-

09:43.080 --> 09:46.280
Which, let me remind you, was supposed to be about Ghostbusters.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.200
laboring this basic point.

09:48.200 --> 09:53.160
One, Anita Sarkeesian proposed a game idea as a thought experiment in 2013.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.040
Two, Anita Sarkeesian didn't actually make this game

09:56.040 --> 09:58.840
because Anita Sarkeesian makes videos for the internet.

09:58.840 --> 10:03.720
Therefore, she secretly thinks that idea was full of shit and wouldn't be profitable,

10:03.720 --> 10:08.280
and therefore, feminist criticism itself is all garbage.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.320
Um.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.280
She was so confident that this game would be successful

10:12.280 --> 10:16.920
that she spent not one cent of her almost million dollars of funding

10:16.920 --> 10:19.480
trying to make this into a game.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.880
And that's why Ghostbusters is-

10:25.080 --> 10:29.400
It's a damn sight easier to be a critic than a creator.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.880
Thunderf00t then cuts to some of the experiments he's done

10:31.880 --> 10:33.640
as if, in order to criticize art,

10:33.640 --> 10:38.120
you have to have done science experiments in an unrelated field of study.

10:38.200 --> 10:38.920
It's okay.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.400
Thunderf00t's allowed to criticize other people's creative work

10:41.400 --> 10:42.920
because he's done beekeeping.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.440
Where's Anita's bees?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.440
Hashtag where's Anita's bees.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.200
He also spends a good chunk of time regurgitating these memes of Anita Sarkeesian

10:50.200 --> 10:52.680
where they take comments she made about gender signifiers

10:52.680 --> 10:54.680
and character design in fictional media

10:54.680 --> 10:57.320
and twist it to somehow mean that she thinks

10:57.320 --> 10:59.720
real-life women shouldn't wear pink

10:59.720 --> 11:01.240
or dress up at all

11:01.240 --> 11:02.280
or have earrings.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.440
Criticizing women for how they dress.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.720
Oh, how rational!

11:05.720 --> 11:07.640
Because that's what Anita was doing.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.000
Let me remind you that this is a video about Ghostbusters

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
and half of it is spent complaining

11:13.000 --> 11:15.880
that Anita Sarkeesian sometimes wears pink.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.640
Which is one of the reasons why this girl-powered trailer here

11:20.200 --> 11:24.520
currently has over a third of a million dislikes.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.880
Oh, that's why people didn't like the Ghostbusters trailer.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.000
Thanks, Thunderf00t.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.360
But let's move on to his other video about Ghostbusters.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.720
Yeah, he made two.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.880
Because, in the words of Willy Shaxpare,

11:39.880 --> 11:42.440
brevity is the soul of idiots.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.920
Talk forever about things you don't like.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.520
Never stop talking about them.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.640
That'll prove you right.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.680
I'm rational.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.040
I'm rational!

11:50.040 --> 11:52.120
Sexual harassment isn't a big deal.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.400
It's not a big deal!

11:53.400 --> 11:54.440
It's not a big deal!

11:54.440 --> 11:55.160
AAAAAAAA

11:55.160 --> 11:57.480
This video's even better because he starts to complain

11:57.480 --> 11:59.800
not just about the fact woms are in the film

11:59.800 --> 12:04.440
and inexplicably claiming they think having a vagina makes them special

12:04.440 --> 12:07.800
but he even stops to get upset about the production design.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.200
Women who grow tall have trouble getting radiation warning signs.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.360
Just put a little heart in the middle of them

12:14.360 --> 12:16.360
because, you know, chick flick.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.280
You see?

12:20.280 --> 12:23.400
It's feminist because they drew a heart on the proton pack.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.880
That's not even what hearts look like in real life.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.240
They're not even pink.

12:29.240 --> 12:29.740
You see?

12:31.240 --> 12:32.360
Men have hearts too.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.480
This is an unrealistic depiction of anatomy

12:37.480 --> 12:40.280
which is what Ghostbusters is all about after all.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.040
God, I'm so rational.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.360
He even takes the time to recast feminists criticizing the trailer

12:46.360 --> 12:49.160
as proof that feminism is eating itself.

12:49.160 --> 12:53.640
Oh god, I love the bloodbath when the progressive stack

12:53.640 --> 12:57.160
intersectional social justice warriors eat each other.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.480
Oh yeah, it's really a bloodbath.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.240
I really was not pleased with the way that Leslie Jones was portrayed

13:03.240 --> 13:04.200
at least in the trailer.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.040
Feminism is collapsing!

13:08.040 --> 13:09.240
The empire is falling!

13:09.240 --> 13:10.440
Run for your lives!

13:11.240 --> 13:14.280
He also brings up the photograph again a few more times.

13:14.280 --> 13:18.440
Imagine seeing women simply celebrating having a greater level of representation

13:18.440 --> 13:20.920
in a place where statistically they usually don't

13:20.920 --> 13:22.520
and feeling threatened by it

13:22.520 --> 13:26.360
so much so that you have to keep bringing it up across multiple videos.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.480
Thunderf00t's the sort of guy who will criticize a documentary

13:29.480 --> 13:32.840
for being weirdly obsessive about Anita Sarkeesian

13:32.840 --> 13:36.520
while being weirdly obsessive about Anita Sarkeesian

13:36.520 --> 13:39.720
so much so that he agreed to appear in the documentary!

13:40.520 --> 13:44.120
I'm beginning to think the man's a little bit obsessive about this one woman.

13:44.120 --> 13:44.840
Just a little.

13:44.840 --> 13:45.880
Just a little bit.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.400
The great French psychoanalytic theorist Jacques-Louis Lakin

13:49.400 --> 13:50.200
Is that how you pronounce it?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.400
I've done no research.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.880
once claimed that it's possible for a belief or action to be pathological or obsessive

13:55.960 --> 13:58.120
even if the belief is technically accurate.

13:58.120 --> 14:03.000
Let's take for granted for a moment that Anita Sarkeesian really is wrong about everything.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.760
Even her subjective opinions of art are now objectively wrong somehow.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.560
Why, then, does Thunderf00t feel the need

14:09.560 --> 14:13.640
to keep saying she's wrong over and over and over

14:13.640 --> 14:15.720
for literally years?

14:16.920 --> 14:18.280
If she had simply been wrong,

14:18.920 --> 14:21.480
people could have criticized her work and moved on

14:21.480 --> 14:23.880
or just, you know, ignored her.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.720
But instead, even when talking about something completely unrelated

14:27.720 --> 14:29.560
like Ghostbusters,

14:29.560 --> 14:31.480
there's an inescapable need

14:31.480 --> 14:33.640
to mediate it by talking about her.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.200
Imagine if I reviewed the Star Wars trailer

14:36.200 --> 14:38.760
by talking at length about how awful Kevin is.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.040
That piece of shit.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.080
Trying to upstage me with his overly white smile.

14:43.080 --> 14:46.200
He didn't make a video game he had an idea for two years ago.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.160
That wanker.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.720
Why didn't he learn programming and actually make it?

14:49.720 --> 14:52.200
Which is obviously what he said he was going to do.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.000
And that's why Star Wars is bad!

14:55.000 --> 14:58.200
I would seem a little obsessed, wouldn't I?

14:58.200 --> 15:01.480
To Thunderf00t and his followers, or shall we say foot soldiers,

15:02.760 --> 15:05.560
feminism is a singular, monolithic entity

15:05.560 --> 15:08.120
that's out to take away our games and films

15:08.120 --> 15:12.200
and doesn't create anything except for, you know, the film they created

15:12.200 --> 15:16.360
and for whom any particular feminist is so interchangeable with Anita Sarkeesian

15:16.360 --> 15:19.400
that you might as well rant about her instead of the subject at hand.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.000
It's almost silly of me to have chosen Ghostbusters

15:23.000 --> 15:24.760
as my reason to talk about Thunderf00t

15:24.760 --> 15:28.440
because ultimately his videos aren't about Ghostbusters

15:28.440 --> 15:31.480
or even feminists or even Anita Sarkeesian.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.640
They're a two-minute hate,

15:33.640 --> 15:36.520
although Thunderf00t isn't merciful enough to make his videos that short,

15:37.080 --> 15:40.440
directed at the straw man that has been made of Anita Sarkeesian

15:40.440 --> 15:43.720
as some sort of load-bearing icon of feminism

15:43.720 --> 15:46.280
over hours and hours and hours of videos

15:46.280 --> 15:50.760
calling her a lying monster who wants you to respect her vagina.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.320
You know, that thing she famously said.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.120
Ever.

16:16.280 --> 16:39.960
Is this rational?

16:40.600 --> 16:44.360
Are Thunderf00t's videos indicative of how to approach any issue in the world?

16:45.000 --> 16:49.560
Or is it just easily digestible, self-aggrandizing propaganda?

16:50.680 --> 16:54.760
Even Thunderf00t himself occasionally finds himself wondering why,

16:55.560 --> 16:59.400
despite making dozens and dozens and dozens of videos on the topic,

16:59.400 --> 17:02.040
somehow he hasn't yet destroyed feminism.

17:02.040 --> 17:06.920
It's almost as if making videos designed to affirm an audience that they're already right

17:06.920 --> 17:08.760
doesn't actually change anyone's mind

17:08.760 --> 17:13.240
and won't make a large and diverse school of thought spontaneously evaporate.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.320
And that's not even to mention that this isn't the first terrible Ghostbusters trailer.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.840
Close to, if not literally none, of the footage Thunderf00t showed

17:20.840 --> 17:23.320
when he was trying to demonstrate what made the originals good

17:23.320 --> 17:25.320
is in the trailer for the original film.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.320
It's edited more like a horror trailer,

17:27.320 --> 17:31.880
when Ghostbusters is pretty objectively a sex comedy with mild horror elements.

17:31.880 --> 17:35.560
And by mild horror elements, I mean this one scene is pretty scary,

17:35.560 --> 17:37.080
and the rest is a comedy.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.760
At this point, it's pretty much standard for a Ghostbusters trailer to be bad.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.000
In a way, all good films resist being turned into trailers,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.080
leaving something missing from them.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.320
I'm not saying the new film is going to be good.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.440
I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's good or not.

17:52.440 --> 17:56.600
I'm saying that having a bad trailer is the most Ghostbusters thing there is.

17:57.320 --> 18:02.600
This is, in a kind of paradoxical way, a good sign for the film.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.560
At least I hope it is.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.800
I like it when films are good, personally.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.840
But even then, if it's bad, it's just gonna be a bad film.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.000
It's not gonna be proof that the feminists are coming to get us.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.640
The feminists are coming to get us!

18:18.920 --> 18:19.880
What? Why?

18:20.440 --> 18:24.280
They heard this video wasn't going to be enough about how special it is to have a vagina.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.840
Which is what feminism is all about, after all.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.120
So they're coming to get us!

18:28.120 --> 18:32.200
They're gonna tie us down and read the vagina monologues to us until we submit!

18:33.160 --> 18:35.400
Have you actually read the vagina monologues?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.920
Some of them are actually pretty engaging.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.560
Now!

18:37.560 --> 18:38.840
There's no time!

18:38.840 --> 18:40.120
Take only what's important!

18:44.680 --> 18:45.400
Well, I gotta...

18:46.680 --> 18:49.320
Well, I better get packing and go on the run again.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.440
But first, a word from our Patreon sponsors.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.720
If you're wondering why your name isn't here,

19:01.720 --> 19:05.080
it's because Patreon doesn't actually charge people's cards until the end of the month,

19:05.080 --> 19:08.440
so everyone who joined me this month will get into the credits next time.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.720
I promise this isn't some trick to save me from having to write more credits.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.280
I'd like to make special thanks to Amanda Beverley,

19:14.280 --> 19:15.640
Alexander Corbett,

19:15.640 --> 19:16.840
Ciaran Dachtler,

19:16.840 --> 19:18.120
Jason Walter,

19:18.120 --> 19:19.240
Bob Leonard,

19:19.240 --> 19:20.360
Rob Brunt,

19:20.360 --> 19:21.400
Jenny Angel,

19:21.400 --> 19:22.360
Tyler Jay,

19:22.360 --> 19:26.440
and Kevin M. Knippy, who got in touch and told me how to pronounce his name.

19:26.440 --> 19:26.940
Thanks.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.680
At least I hope that was him.

19:29.640 --> 19:30.140
Oh no!

19:31.800 --> 19:34.520
If anyone wants a different name in the credits from their Patreon name,

19:34.520 --> 19:35.960
feel free to message me and let me know.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.720
Thanks for watching.

19:37.720 --> 19:42.680
And an extra special thanks to Corwin Light-Williams, whose name I keep spelling wrong.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.560
It's really stupid of me.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.360
I don't even know how.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.520
I spelled it wrong differently twice.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.880
I have no idea what's wrong with me.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.200
I'm going to take my two most prized possessions,

19:54.200 --> 19:55.640
a book I haven't read,

19:55.640 --> 20:00.360
and the sword I stole from a Chester Youth Theatre production of Richard III about six years ago.

20:00.360 --> 20:04.200
And I know some of you recognize this because I know you follow me on YouTube.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.640
I'm going to get the fuck out of here.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.020
Shit!

20:15.080 --> 20:15.580
There we go.

20:15.580 --> 20:16.080
Alright.
