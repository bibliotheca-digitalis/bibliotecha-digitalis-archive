1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
You're right Carl, linen is expensive and we should kill all the white people, which

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,240
is what this book says. Oh hello! I didn't see you there. Today we're going to watch

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,240
the new Ghostbusters trailer. I'm sure it'll be great!

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,240
Oh yeah, of course. Sorry. Alright, this time.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Aaron, no one's home.

6
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,360
For too long, the real heroes of culture have sat idly by and let feminism destroy everything

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,360
great about society. But with this Ghostbusters trailer, it's time to fight back. You can

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,920
tell it's feminist because there's wombs in it. What's next? The Stay Puft Marshmallow

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,920
woman? They're taking our movies and our video games and soon there'll be nothing left. Busting

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,560
used to make us all feel good. But now, now I'm lonely. I'm lonely and it's everyone else's

11
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,320
fault. But what are we supposed to do about it? Who are we going to telephone?

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Oh hey. What's all this then? Oh I'm doing an over the top satirical parody of the people

13
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,320
who think the Ghostbusters trailer is destroying the world. Yeah well, the thing about that

14
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,200
is, MRAs and anti-feminists have gotten so ridiculous at this point that it's almost

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,360
indistinguishable from parody. It's impossible to do. I mean, not even Roosh knows which

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,160
of his articles are satire anymore. You know that's actually a really good point, isn't

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:13,160
it? This is stupid. We'll do it the normal way. Come on Mort.

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Oh god. Man, that would have been a really stupid gimmick to do in a whole video, right?

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,880
Hey, wait, hold on. I think you dropped this! Luckily you don't need me to tell you the

20
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,920
trailer's bad. You can go and watch it. Or any of the hundred million people who already

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,920
watched it and reacted to it. But whatever, you know, it's a bad trailer. It doesn't...

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,400
It doesn't mean feminists have destroyed Ghostbusters. Feminism is going to destroy Ghostbusters!

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,840
Stop it. We already agreed we're not doing this. Oh really? You know we'd have to pay

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,200
extra to express ship this hat, right? Oh no, we bought a cheap ass fedora on eBay.

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,200
It's a trilby! How dare you! What's more important to me is showcasing one of, if not the greatest

26
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,200
overreactions to a bad trailer in film history. I'm talking, of course, about Thunderf00t.

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Yeah, the Ghostbusters. This time it's a progressive politically correct chick flick.

28
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Thunderf00t, shown here failing to debate noted creationist moron Eric Hovin so badly

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,520
his best rebuttals consist of calling him a retard in post, knows the truth. Feminism

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,520
is a threat to Ghostbusters. He's also notable, of course, for making videos about, for example,

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,600
a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman he thinks is wrong, a woman

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,680
he thinks is wrong, and a different woman he thinks is wrong. Oh, and a couple dozen

33
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,080
more about that first woman, just to make sure you know she's wrong. You know, the ground

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,920
has to be properly covered. She's wrong. Did I make that clear enough? Okay, no, maybe

35
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,840
a couple more. There we go. Now we can put it to rest and rant about the new Ghostbuster

36
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,440
film. It's Ghostbusters, but that's fine. Sure, get the name of the film wrong. That

37
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,000
doesn't impact your argument at all. Thunderf00t appears to have a problem with this picture

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
taken on set because, you see, yeah, it's a bunch of privileged middle-class women who

39
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,680
think that merely having a certain set of sexual organs makes them special. However,

40
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,960
these women don't actually realize that taking a picture where you've deliberately and completely

41
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,560
excluded people by their sex is kind of archetypal sexism. Not only—

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,200
Oh, how exclusionary. There's no men in this picture. Oh, yeah, that's the real problem.

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Not the seemingly systematic exclusion of women from working on film sets or anything.

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,880
You know, makes you think, who are the real sexists? Answer, these women. Look how happy

45
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,960
they are to have jobs. You are parasites on other people's creativity and their grammar,

46
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,600
apparently. Help, the feminists have attached themselves to my veins and they're drawing

47
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:16,200
out my ability to spell and type. Why weren't there men in this picture? Where are the men?

48
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,800
It's the sort of crazy lack of self-awareness that allows you to pronounce that 100% of white people are racists,

49
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,840
but black people can't be racist.

50
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,560
Wait, why is he cutting to a clip from CBSN? What does this have to do with Ghostbuster?

51
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,720
Oh, I get it. He thinks this person saying something stupid on TV is somehow representative of feminism as a whole.

52
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,800
Really? Is that—is that the shit he's pulling? Is he really pulling that? Is this not a joke?

53
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,960
Because this argument is about as stupid as it would be to use the time Thunderf00t didn't

54
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,080
have a very good debate with Eric Hovind as proof that all atheists are bad at debates.

55
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,240
Is it impossible? Is it an absolute impossibility for God to exist?

56
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:09,720
There is, uh, when you say, is it impossible, um, it is a malformed question.

57
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,840
Can you un-ask a bad question, please?

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,400
This is why atheism doesn't look credible to so many people, because when asked a really

59
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,920
straight-up question, the answer is, uh, um, the question is wrong.

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,160
Oh, God. I mean, no, no, sorry, I can't say that because there isn't one.

61
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,200
About 36 minutes into the video, Thunderf00t declares victory and tries to run away,

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,680
presumably in the hopes that he can edit the video enough to make it look like he really did win.

63
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,520
Instead, he just settled on calling him a retard over and over, which, as we know,

64
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
is basically proof that you're right.

65
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,240
Hovind stops him by asking perhaps the easiest question a human has ever been asked.

66
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,720
Is everybody's reasoning valid?

67
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,320
Oh, I can see the cogs turning. Is everybody's reasoning valid? What's his answer gonna be?

68
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,720
We are humans. We have the same genome. Everyone here has more or less the same genome.

69
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Oh, he waffles for, like, a straight minute about how humans have brains.

70
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,920
I mean, that's almost an answer to the question.

71
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,320
A better answer would be no, but his was good, too.

72
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,680
I guess I just don't have the quick-thinking skills he does.

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,720
Even when he's right, this guy's bad at arguing.

74
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,760
I'm beginning to have some sympathy for creationism he's so bad.

75
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Ah-ha!

76
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Logical fallacy! That's a logical fallacy!

77
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
You can't, just because someone's bad at arguing,

78
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,680
doesn't make their argument wrong or someone else's argument right.

79
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,720
That's correct, my joke was technically fallacious, but it was also a joke.

80
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,560
No, you have to unsay it now, because if not,

81
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,480
I'll send my army of followers to pick apart that one joke you made

82
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,600
and ignore the actual point of the video.

83
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm doing you a favor, unsay it now!

84
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,160
Okay, you know what? Fine, I will.

85
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,920
That was an initial confusion, but I think now we've got an answer to the question.

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,640
Are you happy?

87
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,960
Do I look happy to you?

88
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,600
Everywhere I look, even in trailers for science fiction comedy films,

89
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,840
I see feminists trying to take over and force their agenda down our throats.

90
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,840
I see feminists trying to take over and force their agenda down our throats.

91
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,440
And this is somehow everyone else's fault, but mine.

92
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm so rational.

93
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm rational!

94
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
This is what a patriarch looks like.

95
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,160
So, so far, Thunderf00t's two biggest problems with the new Ghostbusters film

96
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,040
is that there weren't any men in a picture taken to celebrate

97
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,960
how many women were working on the film,

98
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,440
and that this guy on an unrelated TV broadcast said something stupid.

99
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,600
Oh, I smell a Razzie already.

100
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,160
If you celebrate the difference in gender ratio

101
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,200
from the production staff on your film to another film,

102
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,320
that's basically the same as demanding people respect your vagina.

103
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
It's literally the same thing.

104
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,960
No, wait, I'm sure he's getting his actual reasoning why Ghostbusters is bad soon.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,040
I mean, we're only, you know, halfway through.

106
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,160
I mean, you recall a while back.

107
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,920
Anita Sarkeesian, pitch this-

108
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,960
Even this video is about Anita Sarkeesian.

109
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,920
He can never stop talking about her.

110
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,520
Ghostbusters is bad.

111
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me tell you about Anita.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,640
Didn't she make this video in, like, 2013?

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,200
I mean, what the fuck?

114
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,080
Thunderf00t spends literally half this video-

115
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,280
Which, let me remind you, was supposed to be about Ghostbusters.

116
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,200
laboring this basic point.

117
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,160
One, Anita Sarkeesian proposed a game idea as a thought experiment in 2013.

118
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,040
Two, Anita Sarkeesian didn't actually make this game

119
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,840
because Anita Sarkeesian makes videos for the internet.

120
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,720
Therefore, she secretly thinks that idea was full of shit and wouldn't be profitable,

121
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,280
and therefore, feminist criticism itself is all garbage.

122
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,320
Um.

123
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,280
She was so confident that this game would be successful

124
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,920
that she spent not one cent of her almost million dollars of funding

125
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,480
trying to make this into a game.

126
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,880
And that's why Ghostbusters is-

127
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,400
It's a damn sight easier to be a critic than a creator.

128
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,880
Thunderf00t then cuts to some of the experiments he's done

129
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
as if, in order to criticize art,

130
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,120
you have to have done science experiments in an unrelated field of study.

131
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,920
It's okay.

132
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,400
Thunderf00t's allowed to criticize other people's creative work

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,920
because he's done beekeeping.

134
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,440
Where's Anita's bees?

135
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Hashtag where's Anita's bees.

136
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,200
He also spends a good chunk of time regurgitating these memes of Anita Sarkeesian

137
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,680
where they take comments she made about gender signifiers

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,680
and character design in fictional media

139
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,320
and twist it to somehow mean that she thinks

140
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,720
real-life women shouldn't wear pink

141
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
or dress up at all

142
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
or have earrings.

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,440
Criticizing women for how they dress.

144
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh, how rational!

145
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,640
Because that's what Anita was doing.

146
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,000
Let me remind you that this is a video about Ghostbusters

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and half of it is spent complaining

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,880
that Anita Sarkeesian sometimes wears pink.

149
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,640
Which is one of the reasons why this girl-powered trailer here

150
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,520
currently has over a third of a million dislikes.

151
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,880
Oh, that's why people didn't like the Ghostbusters trailer.

152
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,000
Thanks, Thunderf00t.

153
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,360
But let's move on to his other video about Ghostbusters.

154
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,720
Yeah, he made two.

155
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,880
Because, in the words of Willy Shaxpare,

156
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,440
brevity is the soul of idiots.

157
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,920
Talk forever about things you don't like.

158
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Never stop talking about them.

159
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,640
That'll prove you right.

160
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,680
I'm rational.

161
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm rational!

162
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Sexual harassment isn't a big deal.

163
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,400
It's not a big deal!

164
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,440
It's not a big deal!

165
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,160
AAAAAAAA

166
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,480
This video's even better because he starts to complain

167
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,800
not just about the fact woms are in the film

168
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,440
and inexplicably claiming they think having a vagina makes them special

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,800
but he even stops to get upset about the production design.

170
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,200
Women who grow tall have trouble getting radiation warning signs.

171
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,360
Just put a little heart in the middle of them

172
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
because, you know, chick flick.

173
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,280
You see?

174
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,400
It's feminist because they drew a heart on the proton pack.

175
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,880
That's not even what hearts look like in real life.

176
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,240
They're not even pink.

177
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,740
You see?

178
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360
Men have hearts too.

179
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,480
This is an unrealistic depiction of anatomy

180
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,280
which is what Ghostbusters is all about after all.

181
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,040
God, I'm so rational.

182
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,360
He even takes the time to recast feminists criticizing the trailer

183
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,160
as proof that feminism is eating itself.

184
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,640
Oh god, I love the bloodbath when the progressive stack

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,160
intersectional social justice warriors eat each other.

186
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,480
Oh yeah, it's really a bloodbath.

187
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,240
I really was not pleased with the way that Leslie Jones was portrayed

188
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
at least in the trailer.

189
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,040
Feminism is collapsing!

190
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
The empire is falling!

191
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,440
Run for your lives!

192
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,280
He also brings up the photograph again a few more times.

193
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,440
Imagine seeing women simply celebrating having a greater level of representation

194
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,920
in a place where statistically they usually don't

195
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,520
and feeling threatened by it

196
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,360
so much so that you have to keep bringing it up across multiple videos.

197
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Thunderf00t's the sort of guy who will criticize a documentary

198
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,840
for being weirdly obsessive about Anita Sarkeesian

199
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,520
while being weirdly obsessive about Anita Sarkeesian

200
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,720
so much so that he agreed to appear in the documentary!

201
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm beginning to think the man's a little bit obsessive about this one woman.

202
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,840
Just a little.

203
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,880
Just a little bit.

204
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,400
The great French psychoanalytic theorist Jacques-Louis Lakin

205
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Is that how you pronounce it?

206
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
I've done no research.

207
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,880
once claimed that it's possible for a belief or action to be pathological or obsessive

208
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,120
even if the belief is technically accurate.

209
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's take for granted for a moment that Anita Sarkeesian really is wrong about everything.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,760
Even her subjective opinions of art are now objectively wrong somehow.

211
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,560
Why, then, does Thunderf00t feel the need

212
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,640
to keep saying she's wrong over and over and over

213
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,720
for literally years?

214
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,280
If she had simply been wrong,

215
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,480
people could have criticized her work and moved on

216
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,880
or just, you know, ignored her.

217
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,720
But instead, even when talking about something completely unrelated

218
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,560
like Ghostbusters,

219
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,480
there's an inescapable need

220
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,640
to mediate it by talking about her.

221
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
Imagine if I reviewed the Star Wars trailer

222
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,760
by talking at length about how awful Kevin is.

223
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,040
That piece of shit.

224
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,080
Trying to upstage me with his overly white smile.

225
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,200
He didn't make a video game he had an idea for two years ago.

226
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,160
That wanker.

227
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,720
Why didn't he learn programming and actually make it?

228
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,200
Which is obviously what he said he was going to do.

229
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,000
And that's why Star Wars is bad!

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I would seem a little obsessed, wouldn't I?

231
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,480
To Thunderf00t and his followers, or shall we say foot soldiers,

232
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,560
feminism is a singular, monolithic entity

233
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,120
that's out to take away our games and films

234
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,200
and doesn't create anything except for, you know, the film they created

235
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,360
and for whom any particular feminist is so interchangeable with Anita Sarkeesian

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,400
that you might as well rant about her instead of the subject at hand.

237
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,000
It's almost silly of me to have chosen Ghostbusters

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,760
as my reason to talk about Thunderf00t

239
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,440
because ultimately his videos aren't about Ghostbusters

240
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,480
or even feminists or even Anita Sarkeesian.

241
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,640
They're a two-minute hate,

242
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,520
although Thunderf00t isn't merciful enough to make his videos that short,

243
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,440
directed at the straw man that has been made of Anita Sarkeesian

244
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,720
as some sort of load-bearing icon of feminism

245
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,280
over hours and hours and hours of videos

246
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,760
calling her a lying monster who wants you to respect her vagina.

247
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,320
You know, that thing she famously said.

248
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Ever.

249
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:39,960
Is this rational?

250
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,360
Are Thunderf00t's videos indicative of how to approach any issue in the world?

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,560
Or is it just easily digestible, self-aggrandizing propaganda?

252
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,760
Even Thunderf00t himself occasionally finds himself wondering why,

253
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,400
despite making dozens and dozens and dozens of videos on the topic,

254
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,040
somehow he hasn't yet destroyed feminism.

255
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,920
It's almost as if making videos designed to affirm an audience that they're already right

256
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,760
doesn't actually change anyone's mind

257
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,240
and won't make a large and diverse school of thought spontaneously evaporate.

258
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,320
And that's not even to mention that this isn't the first terrible Ghostbusters trailer.

259
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,840
Close to, if not literally none, of the footage Thunderf00t showed

260
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,320
when he was trying to demonstrate what made the originals good

261
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
is in the trailer for the original film.

262
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
It's edited more like a horror trailer,

263
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,880
when Ghostbusters is pretty objectively a sex comedy with mild horror elements.

264
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,560
And by mild horror elements, I mean this one scene is pretty scary,

265
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,080
and the rest is a comedy.

266
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,760
At this point, it's pretty much standard for a Ghostbusters trailer to be bad.

267
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,000
In a way, all good films resist being turned into trailers,

268
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,080
leaving something missing from them.

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm not saying the new film is going to be good.

270
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,440
I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's good or not.

271
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm saying that having a bad trailer is the most Ghostbusters thing there is.

272
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,600
This is, in a kind of paradoxical way, a good sign for the film.

273
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,560
At least I hope it is.

274
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,800
I like it when films are good, personally.

275
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,840
But even then, if it's bad, it's just gonna be a bad film.

276
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,000
It's not gonna be proof that the feminists are coming to get us.

277
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,640
The feminists are coming to get us!

278
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,880
What? Why?

279
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,280
They heard this video wasn't going to be enough about how special it is to have a vagina.

280
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,840
Which is what feminism is all about, after all.

281
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120
So they're coming to get us!

282
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,200
They're gonna tie us down and read the vagina monologues to us until we submit!

283
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,400
Have you actually read the vagina monologues?

284
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
Some of them are actually pretty engaging.

285
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,560
Now!

286
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,840
There's no time!

287
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,120
Take only what's important!

288
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,400
Well, I gotta...

289
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,320
Well, I better get packing and go on the run again.

290
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,440
But first, a word from our Patreon sponsors.

291
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,720
If you're wondering why your name isn't here,

292
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,080
it's because Patreon doesn't actually charge people's cards until the end of the month,

293
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,440
so everyone who joined me this month will get into the credits next time.

294
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,720
I promise this isn't some trick to save me from having to write more credits.

295
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,280
I'd like to make special thanks to Amanda Beverley,

296
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
Alexander Corbett,

297
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,840
Ciaran Dachtler,

298
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,120
Jason Walter,

299
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,240
Bob Leonard,

300
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,360
Rob Brunt,

301
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,400
Jenny Angel,

302
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,360
Tyler Jay,

303
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,440
and Kevin M. Knippy, who got in touch and told me how to pronounce his name.

304
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:26,940
Thanks.

305
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,680
At least I hope that was him.

306
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,140
Oh no!

307
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,520
If anyone wants a different name in the credits from their Patreon name,

308
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,960
feel free to message me and let me know.

309
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,720
Thanks for watching.

310
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,680
And an extra special thanks to Corwin Light-Williams, whose name I keep spelling wrong.

311
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,560
It's really stupid of me.

312
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,360
I don't even know how.

313
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,520
I spelled it wrong differently twice.

314
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,880
I have no idea what's wrong with me.

315
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,200
I'm going to take my two most prized possessions,

316
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,640
a book I haven't read,

317
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,360
and the sword I stole from a Chester Youth Theatre production of Richard III about six years ago.

318
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,200
And I know some of you recognize this because I know you follow me on YouTube.

319
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,640
I'm going to get the fuck out of here.

320
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,020
Shit!

321
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,580
There we go.

322
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,080
Alright.
