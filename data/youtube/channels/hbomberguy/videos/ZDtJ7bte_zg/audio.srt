1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
Let's talk about plagiarism for a bit.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,880
In case you're not hip to all the best YouTube drama,

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,000
a video game YouTuber called Weegee the God put out a video recently entitled

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Why the Blue Yeti Sucks.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,080
The video is incredibly obnoxious, and this is me we're talking about here.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,800
The Blue Yeti is a $100 stainless steel toy.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,080
Everything good you heard about it, forget it.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,420
They're lies born from hobbyists with no concept of quality.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,920
Along with dismissing a fairly decent and affordable USB microphone

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,160
for newer or young people who don't need professional quality,

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,080
his voice is in this annoyingly performative tone,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,360
his audio is noticeably overproduced,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,740
and every sentence ends with him smugly droning the final word,

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,780
and it's super grating to listen to.

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,860
But worse than any of that, almost all the video's content, style, arguments,

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,580
and research is stolen.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,160
I'm here to tell you the Blue Yeti is a $100 stainless steel toy.

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
Everything good you heard about it, forget it.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,660
They're lies born from hobbyists with no concept of quality.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,280
There's a lesser-known YouTuber called Soul Brother Number 3.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,160
I've been a pretty big fan of his for over a year.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,900
I used a Blue Yeti for a while until seeing his video series,

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,400
How to Be an Online Voice Actor,

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,820
and taking notes about the results of better acoustics,

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,160
placement, and the value of XLR microphones.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,400
In fact, when I was looking for a good preamp late last year,

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,360
I paused one of his cutaway shots of his own setup

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,620
and found a version of that one on eBay.

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,580
He made a video about how to use DSLRs,

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,400
and even though I haven't used those for a while,

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
I got into Samyang lenses as a result of him mentioning them.

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,440
Here's me plagiarizing that shot from the video with the exact same lens.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,820
I'm beginning to think I might be a little obsessed with this guy.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,860
I've seen all of his videos multiple times,

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,520
so when this video got on my radar,

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,060
I immediately noticed that not only did he rip off Soul Brother's style,

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,560
but he even stole entire lines and sentences.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,740
Here he is ripping off really basic things you could have changed to hide it,

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,200
like the diagrams and method of highlighting examples while talking about them.

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,200
It's utterly absurd how much of a ripoff this is.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,980
When someone pointed this out to Ouija,

42
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,060
as if he needed to be told he'd done this,

43
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,640
he added the video as a source deep in the description,

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,680
claiming he quotes and references him.

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,320
Yeah, and Diesel was just quoting and referencing Stardust Crusaders, too.

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,100
The really shitty thing about this, though,

47
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,480
is that it completely reappropriates Soul Brother's ultimate point.

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,900
The source videos are fun and useful tutorials

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,480
with the intent of informing and helping a group of people

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,980
that could benefit from knowing.

51
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,280
The fact the Blue Yeti isn't the apex of quality

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,480
is worth talking about when discussing the craft,

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,740
and more importantly, elevating voice acting to a craft

54
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,280
is a really great thing to do.

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,780
It's just a for-fun or Skype microphone.

56
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,580
It's, to actually quote Soul Brother, a toy.

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,280
Ouija's version of the video makes this the front-and-center argument.

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,540
The function of the video has become a long and unnecessary takedown of a microphone.

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,740
The advice Ouija repackaged was good, very good,

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,500
but it's been repackaged into a rant about a popular consumer-grade microphone.

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,740
That's probably the most offensive part of this.

62
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,120
One of the best tutorials on the Internet

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,160
has literally become a footnote in garbage clickbait.

64
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,000
If that isn't the Internet's effect on truth and reason in microcosm,

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
then I don't know what is.

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,580
Now, you notice how this sounds all nice and clean and clear

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,120
and how this sounds like absolute total garbage?

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,740
Ouija the God there, comparing a very expensive professional microphone setup

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,880
to a microphone that sounds fine,

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,080
especially compared to other USB microphones in that price range,

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,540
or, you know, no microphone at all.

72
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, that right there is the difference between a toy

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,340
and a real audio setup.

74
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,240
Yes, that right there is the difference,

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,380
and we call that difference $650 US!

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,740
If you want to know what intellectual honesty looks like,

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,660
you know that video I said inspired me to spend far too much money

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,160
on some nice manual lenses?

79
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
You can't watch that video anymore

80
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,000
because Soul Brother took it down for some slight errors.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,160
Imagine that, Ouija, taking down a video because it's got mistakes in it.

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,800
Can you imagine what it must be like to be that?

83
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,160
CAN YOU FUCKING IMAGINE?!

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,260
But if you're a fan of Soul Brother like I am,

85
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,760
this isn't the first time his work has been plagiarized.

86
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,580
In December last year, a video entitled

87
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
What Happened to Kentucky Fried Chicken?

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,540
made by Austin McConnell came out and went pretty viral.

89
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,340
It currently has over 1.7 million views.

90
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,580
Watching it, someone intimately familiar with Soul Brother's style

91
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,580
will instantly recognize flourishes and stylistic choices

92
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,240
all but unique to him.

93
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,500
All right, check it out, so...

94
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,420
All right, so check it.

95
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,200
Talent, equipment, and availability.

96
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,460
Showing weakness in any of these can manifest itself

97
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,660
in you not getting paid.

98
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,500
There are five keys to the success of your average fast food joint.

99
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,420
Fail in any of these areas and folks aren't gonna wanna buy your product.

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,380
Recognizable enough that someone noticed this and tipped Soul Brother off.

101
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,880
When he asked him about it, McConnell openly claimed him as an inspiration.

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,740
Now, this is an interesting creative gray area.

103
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,960
No one's on the hook for being inspired by someone else's style or work,

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,500
but completely jacking someone's style for attention is certainly a bad look.

105
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,340
It's not uncommon in the YouTube community for someone to borrow

106
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,840
someone else's ideas if they seem good or popular.

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,580
The guy who first decided to overreact to Five Nights at Freddy's footage

108
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,300
probably founded numerous careers for several people,

109
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,220
including that of the game's creator.

110
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,460
You really can't copyright a style or ideas, and that's a good thing.

111
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,380
McConnell's poor ripoff is still better than the stuff he used to make

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,940
before he was stealing stuff,

113
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,540
and the YouTube jump-scare economy has provided entertainment for millions.

114
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,080
But there's a difference between saying something new and unique to you

115
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,500
using a style inspired by others and trying to be someone else.

116
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,460
This comic persona is occasionally entertaining,

117
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,620
but it's Soul Brother's comic persona.

118
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,960
There's an unwritten rule in creative communities

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,260
that this sort of thing makes you kind of a dick.

120
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,720
Additionally, the very poor pacing and length of the video

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,760
makes the style he assumed drag more than it should.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,980
It starts to feel repetitive and overly long,

123
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,200
even though it's only eight minutes, which is something of an achievement.

124
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Style and tone and pacing are hard to master,

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,900
and in borrowing surface elements from Soul Brother,

126
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,280
he fails to accurately capture what makes that method good in the first place.

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,040
He cites Soul Brother as an inspiration,

128
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,360
and I strongly suspect that with time,

129
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,660
McConnell will figure out a style that suits him better

130
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,200
and is more appropriate for the work he ends up making.

131
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,620
If you want to learn some useful tips about voice acting or audio setups

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,000
or editing or writing or filmmaking, you can learn directly from the best.

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,420
Soul Brother does workshops for $80 a piece,

134
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,740
and I know people who can vouch for them being worth the money.

135
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,080
Check the description for a link and some testimonials.

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,660
So there's the first two stories about two very different kinds of plagiarism.

137
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,220
I could bring up that this is a problem that the YouTube rational skeptic community also has,

138
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,600
and lots of them are constantly accusing each other of ripping off their shtick.

139
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,340
What a shock! They're so intellectually honest otherwise!

140
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,640
But my third story today is gonna be mine, because I'm selfish.

141
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,680
A couple days ago, friend and estranged lover Bob Vids

142
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,860
put out a video noting the similarities and criticizing Ouija.

143
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,160
It's pretty good. Check it out.

144
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,200
My original plan for this video was to just remake his entire video word-for-word for a joke,

145
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,280
but toward the end, he made the comment that without building attitudes to calling out plagiarism

146
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,380
when it happens in the YouTube community, it's never gonna get discussed properly,

147
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,700
and I'd much rather contribute to that than putting a lot of effort into a silly joke.

148
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,880
So, here.

149
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,800
You might recall my amazing video about why Bloodborne's great.

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,600
It was very well-received, creatively and culturally, and changed the world.

151
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,400
One thing that most enthused scholars was my introduction and codification

152
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,780
of a concept in game design theory I called play conditioning.

153
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,780
My theory was sound, no one could possibly criticize it because it's perfect, and everyone loved it.

154
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,100
So, of course, like with all beautiful and perfect ideas, someone stole it!

155
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Let me introduce you to Lookipoo.

156
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,500
His video, Bloodborne Did Something Incredible,

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,700
is a cheap knockoff of the general thesis of my video and of play conditioning,

158
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,300
presenting it as if he just suddenly came up with it,

159
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,600
coincidentally in regards to the same game as me, four months after I did.

160
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,300
Found them overly esoteric and difficult in a way that wasn't fun,

161
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,700
and full of overly defensive, get-good-spouting fanboys, and

162
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,700
these people seem to be hardcore, get-good-preaching, masochistic troglodytes

163
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,000
who members of the Souls community don't even recognize,

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
rebutting it with a simple, get-good.

165
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Firstly, the most obvious one.

166
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,100
There's no shield.

167
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,000
The problem was all centered around one mechanic.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
In a word, shields.

169
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Bloodborne, a game about injecting yourself with increasing amounts of dangerous liquid,

170
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,900
is itself the ultimate gateway drug,

171
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,900
giving you a high that essentially turns the game into a socially acceptable drug.

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,300
A good deal of players will spend a lot of time with their shield up, playing it safe,

173
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,000
waiting for only the best possible moment to drop it, strike, and then bring it back up again.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,200
Gamers throw up their shield and dance around the enemy until there's an opening,

175
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,200
they stab, they put the shield back up, rinse, and repeat.

176
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Maybe you shouldn't have rinsed and repeated my video, Luke.

177
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,100
The almost inevitable death of this guy's hand...

178
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,400
things immediately communicates that you're going to be facing seemingly insurmountable odds.

179
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,200
Immediately be greeted by a giant beast who would crush them repeatedly.

180
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
He talks about how uninviting the previous games are,

181
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,300
and how much they hammer home that you're gonna die like I did,

182
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,700
but as we learn later, he never played the previous games before Bloodborne,

183
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,000
so to get across how uninvited he was,

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,200
he has to use footage from the first game he played, which is Bloodborne.

185
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,400
He's using footage of the game he's trying to say made the series more inviting

186
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,700
to prove that the previous games were uninviting.

187
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Also, um, immediately greeted with a giant beast?

188
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Uh, Gasqueagni isn't a giant by Souls game standards.

189
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,800
You don't encounter him immediately,

190
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,400
and he only even transforms into this monster after two-thirds of the fight.

191
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Luke, this is fucking nonsense. What are you doing?

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is a weird thing.

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,100
Like, when I'm talking about people's inability to get into the games

194
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
and how those people are dismissed by fanboys,

195
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,100
I use footage from on the bridge in Demon's Souls.

196
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,400
When he's saying what I said, but worse,

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,100
he's using footage from a very similar area in Dark Souls 3.

198
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,600
Why he thought to do that, I don't know.

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,000
I guess he thought I used that footage for a good reason, so he had to as well.

200
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Well, uh, spoilers.

201
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,500
I used that footage completely at random

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,300
because I had no idea what to put there.

203
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,800
So, uh, well done.

204
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,800
You even managed to copy my laziness.

205
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Idiot.

206
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
So he's just copied the bit on the bridge, right?

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That bit ends in my video like this.

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,900
Then Bloodborne happened.

209
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,200
♪♪

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
I introduced Bloodborne, which, by the way,

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
came out before Dark Souls 3,

212
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,600
the game you were using footage from there, Luke.

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
Uh, the music cuts to music from the game to be dramatic,

214
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,700
and then I fade to the opening sequence of Bloodborne.

215
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,600
Luke, copying not just my points, but their pacing and order,

216
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,900
introduces Bloodborne and then uses an audio cue from Bloodborne,

217
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,400
which I think is the only time he even thinks to do it in the video,

218
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
when he's copying what I did.

219
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
And they responded in 2015 with Bloodborne.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,600
And then talks over the same piece of footage as me

221
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
about what Bloodborne did and about how Miyazaki fixed the problem.

222
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,500
In my video, I outline play conditioning here

223
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,900
and slowly whittle down the problems that lead to people

224
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,600
not enjoying the Souls games into early design elements

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,100
and the shield, using examples of how other people

226
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
who started on the earlier games played it.

227
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,200
He just goes, oh, no, the problem's shields.

228
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,900
Now, he played Bloodborne first,

229
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,700
so how he knows shields are a problem,

230
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,300
having only played that one and Dark Souls 3 afterwards,

231
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,200
I don't know. My ideas and argument

232
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,900
are so poorly mangled at this point,

233
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,700
it's a little embarrassing to think he got the idea from me.

234
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,400
Then he rips off my jokey anecdote

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
about Miyazaki in a boardroom meeting.

236
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
Can you imagine being in the room

237
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,700
when hit attacker Miyazaki was looking at playtest footage

238
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,400
of the previous games and coming up with the concept for Bloodborne

239
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,200
and he was like, hey, hey, take out the shields?

240
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,800
Bad jokes aside, I can just picture the day

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
that Miyazaki walked into the conference room,

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
sat down at the head of the table,

243
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,600
looked left, looked right at all of his development leads

244
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,700
and just said, get rid of the shields.

245
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,100
No shields ever. None.

246
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Okay, one shield, but it's a joke.

247
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,300
Put a joke in the arm description about them

248
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,500
engendering passivity. Passivity.

249
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,800
God, I can't do this voice.

250
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,900
They took away all the shields in the game.

251
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,300
Well, except for one in the base game,

252
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,600
which proves my point with its in-game description,

253
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,300
which reads, quote,

254
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,300
shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity.

255
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,600
My joke about what Miyazaki might say in a boardroom

256
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,500
segs directly into this point.

257
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,300
I make it into part of the joke, actually,

258
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,900
and have him say that in the boardroom meeting.

259
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,400
Luke just awkwardly segs from his half-hearted ripoff

260
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,900
of that section to just be suddenly talking

261
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,500
about the shields item description.

262
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,100
He isn't just copying what I say.

263
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,200
He's copying the order I say it in.

264
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
It wouldn't really have been that hard

265
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,100
for him to make it less obvious.

266
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,000
The immediate next section of my video

267
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
is about the rallying system.

268
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,200
Right after the item description,

269
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,300
he immediately fades into talking about the rally system,

270
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,200
even using the exact same method

271
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,900
of enlarging the health bar on the screen

272
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,300
to demonstrate it better.

273
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm sure other people do this,

274
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,200
but doing it immediately after badly copying

275
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,500
a bunch of my talking points

276
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,600
and also the order I say them in?

277
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,500
Yeah, I wonder where Luke got this idea from.

278
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,200
And I can personally attest to this.

279
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,100
I had never played a Souls game before I played Bloodborne,

280
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,600
and once I finished Bloodborne,

281
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
I felt like a god.

282
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,500
I wanted more. I wanted to taste that drug

283
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
that I was talking about earlier again.

284
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,000
So I went and I played Dark Souls 3

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
in the span of a couple of weekends.

286
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,100
I became consumed with the series.

287
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,900
His personal attestment doesn't make any sense.

288
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,600
If he hadn't played the previous games,

289
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,300
how would he know they were uninviting

290
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,400
or not fun to play,

291
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,200
or how they would have conditioned him?

292
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,400
He was smart enough to know not to steal my story

293
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,300
about having a friend who tried the previous games

294
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,900
and didn't enjoy them and then went back

295
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,800
after Bloodborne to find he suddenly did,

296
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,600
but not smart enough to substitute it

297
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,700
with an anecdote that makes any sense at all.

298
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Additionally, in what is my real problem

299
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
with his work here,

300
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,200
his version of my arguments rest on hearsay

301
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
and general ideas with no examples given

302
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,600
and no experiences of his own to relate to

303
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,500
about the games or examples of problems

304
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,900
with the previous games,

305
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,500
except, of course, that they have shields

306
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,000
and encourage their overuse,

307
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,200
which he just psychically knows is the problem

308
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,800
despite having never played the previous games.

309
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,500
He mangles my longer and more rigorous discussion

310
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,800
of shields so badly,

311
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
he essentially argues that shields are bad

312
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
because they help with defense at all,

313
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
missing my point that they're fine,

314
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,500
but the previous games' design encourages overuse.

315
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,700
These mistakes transform my ideas

316
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,100
into versions incredibly easy for commenters

317
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,400
to pick holes in.

318
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Inadvertently, this video is like a straw man version

319
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,900
of my argument,

320
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,200
but completely accidentally

321
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,500
because he's trying to legitimately make it

322
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
because he didn't understand what he was stealing,

323
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
unless, of course, Lukeypoo is destined

324
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,100
to be an excellent contributor to design theory

325
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
and just needed to get a foot in the door,

326
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,700
which simply happened to be my foot.

327
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,600
I dunno.

328
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,800
I'd honestly preferred if you'd stolen more of my ideas.

329
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,000
As it stands, this video is just insulting to its audience

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,700
and the ideas you're trying to present.

331
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm not mad I was plagiarized, really.

332
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,500
I am being a bit hyperbolic here,

333
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
but I am a little annoyed about the effects of plagiarism.

334
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,900
Not to get too apocalyptic,

335
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,500
but to me, a cardinal sin

336
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,100
is to make an idea look weak

337
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,900
simply by presenting it poorly.

338
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to make videos where if I saw them,

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,900
I'd be convinced and learn something

340
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
and it would further a wider conversation

341
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,300
about design or culture or whatever else

342
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,100
the hell I'm talking about most the time.

343
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,300
If I saw this video,

344
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,200
I'd think the idea was full of shit and write it off.

345
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
I didn't talk about this much before

346
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,200
because I didn't like the idea of going after people,

347
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
you know, but Bob's right.

348
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,300
If we don't talk about this when it happens

349
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
and create that sort of culture,

350
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,200
there's even less to stop this going on,

351
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,600
and I like discussion and furthering of ideas.

352
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I want to see play conditioning looked at more closely

353
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
so its parameters can be explored

354
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
and shown in relation to other games,

355
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,500
not more people just re-coming up with it

356
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,600
in regards to the same game, even.

357
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
The two most upvoted comments on that video

358
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,500
are a comment making fun of how my video

359
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,300
often finds itself in the related videos section of his

360
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,600
and a comment by me,

361
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,900
and honestly, having me in your comment section

362
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
is punishment enough.

363
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,900
The economics of YouTube present a problem

364
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,400
for the content of YouTube

365
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,300
and the wider social conversations

366
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,800
taking place through the medium.

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,300
If you want to make a living on this shitty website,

368
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,600
it's currently set up so that the best business practice

369
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
is to see what's popular and make something similar,

370
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,400
often disgustingly similar.

371
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,500
This stunts creativity and originality.

372
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,700
Soul Brother's video essays are just a small piece

373
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,800
of the stuff he makes.

374
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,700
Most of the time, he's making high-effort redubs of anime

375
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,400
or cool little animated things that are difficult to copy

376
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
and not many people would even think to copy

377
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,900
because they're far from the most popular thing he does,

378
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
but that kind of attitude,

379
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
making what you feel is worth making,

380
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,400
is an important one to have in a space widely dominated

381
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,900
by people trying to make a living

382
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
by being what already did well,

383
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,600
but, you know, again and with their face on it.

384
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,800
In days of old, entertainers and writers

385
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,700
would measure success by how well-regarded their work was

386
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,500
or in how much the wider discussion

387
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,400
was furthered by their contribution.

388
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,600
Nowadays, you measure success

389
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,700
by the amount of imitators you launched.

390
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,000
So, special thanks to number-one Hbomberguy fan, Lookipoo.

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,800
I wish him best of luck in his endeavors

392
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
and hope he himself will one day

393
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,400
produce something worth stealing.

394
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I doubt it, though.

395
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,300
I mean, Jesus Christ, this video is poorly made.

396
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,900
You used the same audio loop for, like, eight straight minutes.

397
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,400
Hey, Lookipoo, I know this guy

398
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,500
who does some really great editing workshops.

399
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,100
Look him up, his name's Soulbrother.
