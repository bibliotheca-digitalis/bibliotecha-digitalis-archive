0	1540	Let's talk about plagiarism for a bit.
1540	3880	In case you're not hip to all the best YouTube drama,
3880	8000	a video game YouTuber called Weegee the God put out a video recently entitled
8000	9840	Why the Blue Yeti Sucks.
9840	13080	The video is incredibly obnoxious, and this is me we're talking about here.
13080	16800	The Blue Yeti is a $100 stainless steel toy.
16800	19080	Everything good you heard about it, forget it.
19080	22420	They're lies born from hobbyists with no concept of quality.
22420	25920	Along with dismissing a fairly decent and affordable USB microphone
25920	29160	for newer or young people who don't need professional quality,
29160	32080	his voice is in this annoyingly performative tone,
32080	34360	his audio is noticeably overproduced,
34360	38740	and every sentence ends with him smugly droning the final word,
38740	41780	and it's super grating to listen to.
41780	45860	But worse than any of that, almost all the video's content, style, arguments,
45860	47580	and research is stolen.
47580	51160	I'm here to tell you the Blue Yeti is a $100 stainless steel toy.
51160	52960	Everything good you heard about it, forget it.
52960	55660	They're lies born from hobbyists with no concept of quality.
55660	58280	There's a lesser-known YouTuber called Soul Brother Number 3.
58280	60160	I've been a pretty big fan of his for over a year.
60160	62900	I used a Blue Yeti for a while until seeing his video series,
62900	64400	How to Be an Online Voice Actor,
64400	66820	and taking notes about the results of better acoustics,
66820	69160	placement, and the value of XLR microphones.
69160	71400	In fact, when I was looking for a good preamp late last year,
71400	74360	I paused one of his cutaway shots of his own setup
74360	76620	and found a version of that one on eBay.
76620	78580	He made a video about how to use DSLRs,
78580	80400	and even though I haven't used those for a while,
80400	83200	I got into Samyang lenses as a result of him mentioning them.
83200	86440	Here's me plagiarizing that shot from the video with the exact same lens.
86480	88820	I'm beginning to think I might be a little obsessed with this guy.
88820	90860	I've seen all of his videos multiple times,
90860	92520	so when this video got on my radar,
92520	96060	I immediately noticed that not only did he rip off Soul Brother's style,
96060	99560	but he even stole entire lines and sentences.
99560	103740	Here he is ripping off really basic things you could have changed to hide it,
103740	108200	like the diagrams and method of highlighting examples while talking about them.
108200	111200	It's utterly absurd how much of a ripoff this is.
111200	112980	When someone pointed this out to Ouija,
112980	115060	as if he needed to be told he'd done this,
115060	117640	he added the video as a source deep in the description,
117640	119680	claiming he quotes and references him.
119680	124320	Yeah, and Diesel was just quoting and referencing Stardust Crusaders, too.
124320	126100	The really shitty thing about this, though,
126100	129480	is that it completely reappropriates Soul Brother's ultimate point.
129480	131900	The source videos are fun and useful tutorials
131900	134480	with the intent of informing and helping a group of people
134480	135980	that could benefit from knowing.
135980	138280	The fact the Blue Yeti isn't the apex of quality
138280	140480	is worth talking about when discussing the craft,
140480	143740	and more importantly, elevating voice acting to a craft
143740	145280	is a really great thing to do.
145280	147780	It's just a for-fun or Skype microphone.
147780	151580	It's, to actually quote Soul Brother, a toy.
151580	155280	Ouija's version of the video makes this the front-and-center argument.
155280	160540	The function of the video has become a long and unnecessary takedown of a microphone.
160540	163740	The advice Ouija repackaged was good, very good,
163740	168500	but it's been repackaged into a rant about a popular consumer-grade microphone.
168500	170740	That's probably the most offensive part of this.
170740	173120	One of the best tutorials on the Internet
173160	177160	has literally become a footnote in garbage clickbait.
177160	181000	If that isn't the Internet's effect on truth and reason in microcosm,
181000	182500	then I don't know what is.
182500	187580	Now, you notice how this sounds all nice and clean and clear
187580	191120	and how this sounds like absolute total garbage?
191120	195740	Ouija the God there, comparing a very expensive professional microphone setup
195740	197880	to a microphone that sounds fine,
197880	201080	especially compared to other USB microphones in that price range,
201080	203540	or, you know, no microphone at all.
203540	206840	Well, that right there is the difference between a toy
206840	209340	and a real audio setup.
209340	212240	Yes, that right there is the difference,
212240	217380	and we call that difference $650 US!
217380	219740	If you want to know what intellectual honesty looks like,
219740	222660	you know that video I said inspired me to spend far too much money
222660	224160	on some nice manual lenses?
224160	226160	You can't watch that video anymore
226160	229000	because Soul Brother took it down for some slight errors.
229000	233160	Imagine that, Ouija, taking down a video because it's got mistakes in it.
233160	235800	Can you imagine what it must be like to be that?
235800	237160	CAN YOU FUCKING IMAGINE?!
237160	239260	But if you're a fan of Soul Brother like I am,
239260	241760	this isn't the first time his work has been plagiarized.
241760	243580	In December last year, a video entitled
243580	245580	What Happened to Kentucky Fried Chicken?
245580	248540	made by Austin McConnell came out and went pretty viral.
248540	251340	It currently has over 1.7 million views.
251340	254580	Watching it, someone intimately familiar with Soul Brother's style
254580	257580	will instantly recognize flourishes and stylistic choices
257580	259240	all but unique to him.
259240	260500	All right, check it out, so...
260500	261420	All right, so check it.
261420	263200	Talent, equipment, and availability.
263200	265460	Showing weakness in any of these can manifest itself
265460	266660	in you not getting paid.
266660	270500	There are five keys to the success of your average fast food joint.
270500	274420	Fail in any of these areas and folks aren't gonna wanna buy your product.
274420	278380	Recognizable enough that someone noticed this and tipped Soul Brother off.
278380	281880	When he asked him about it, McConnell openly claimed him as an inspiration.
281880	284740	Now, this is an interesting creative gray area.
284780	288960	No one's on the hook for being inspired by someone else's style or work,
288960	293500	but completely jacking someone's style for attention is certainly a bad look.
293500	296340	It's not uncommon in the YouTube community for someone to borrow
296340	298840	someone else's ideas if they seem good or popular.
298840	302580	The guy who first decided to overreact to Five Nights at Freddy's footage
302580	305300	probably founded numerous careers for several people,
305300	307220	including that of the game's creator.
307220	311460	You really can't copyright a style or ideas, and that's a good thing.
311460	314380	McConnell's poor ripoff is still better than the stuff he used to make
314400	315940	before he was stealing stuff,
315940	319540	and the YouTube jump-scare economy has provided entertainment for millions.
319540	323080	But there's a difference between saying something new and unique to you
323080	327500	using a style inspired by others and trying to be someone else.
327500	330460	This comic persona is occasionally entertaining,
330460	332620	but it's Soul Brother's comic persona.
332620	334960	There's an unwritten rule in creative communities
334960	337260	that this sort of thing makes you kind of a dick.
337260	339720	Additionally, the very poor pacing and length of the video
339720	342760	makes the style he assumed drag more than it should.
342760	344980	It starts to feel repetitive and overly long,
344980	348200	even though it's only eight minutes, which is something of an achievement.
348200	350400	Style and tone and pacing are hard to master,
350400	352900	and in borrowing surface elements from Soul Brother,
352900	356280	he fails to accurately capture what makes that method good in the first place.
356280	358040	He cites Soul Brother as an inspiration,
358040	360360	and I strongly suspect that with time,
360360	362660	McConnell will figure out a style that suits him better
362660	365200	and is more appropriate for the work he ends up making.
365200	368620	If you want to learn some useful tips about voice acting or audio setups
368620	372000	or editing or writing or filmmaking, you can learn directly from the best.
372000	374420	Soul Brother does workshops for $80 a piece,
374420	376740	and I know people who can vouch for them being worth the money.
376740	379080	Check the description for a link and some testimonials.
379080	382660	So there's the first two stories about two very different kinds of plagiarism.
382660	387220	I could bring up that this is a problem that the YouTube rational skeptic community also has,
387220	390600	and lots of them are constantly accusing each other of ripping off their shtick.
390600	393340	What a shock! They're so intellectually honest otherwise!
393340	396640	But my third story today is gonna be mine, because I'm selfish.
396640	399680	A couple days ago, friend and estranged lover Bob Vids
399680	402860	put out a video noting the similarities and criticizing Ouija.
402860	404160	It's pretty good. Check it out.
404160	409200	My original plan for this video was to just remake his entire video word-for-word for a joke,
409200	413280	but toward the end, he made the comment that without building attitudes to calling out plagiarism
413280	416380	when it happens in the YouTube community, it's never gonna get discussed properly,
416380	420700	and I'd much rather contribute to that than putting a lot of effort into a silly joke.
420700	421880	So, here.
421880	424800	You might recall my amazing video about why Bloodborne's great.
424800	429600	It was very well-received, creatively and culturally, and changed the world.
429600	433400	One thing that most enthused scholars was my introduction and codification
433400	436780	of a concept in game design theory I called play conditioning.
436780	441780	My theory was sound, no one could possibly criticize it because it's perfect, and everyone loved it.
441780	446100	So, of course, like with all beautiful and perfect ideas, someone stole it!
446100	448100	Let me introduce you to Lookipoo.
448100	450500	His video, Bloodborne Did Something Incredible,
450500	454700	is a cheap knockoff of the general thesis of my video and of play conditioning,
454700	457300	presenting it as if he just suddenly came up with it,
457300	461600	coincidentally in regards to the same game as me, four months after I did.
461600	465300	Found them overly esoteric and difficult in a way that wasn't fun,
465300	468700	and full of overly defensive, get-good-spouting fanboys, and
468700	473700	these people seem to be hardcore, get-good-preaching, masochistic troglodytes
473700	477000	who members of the Souls community don't even recognize,
477000	479400	rebutting it with a simple, get-good.
479400	481400	Firstly, the most obvious one.
482900	484100	There's no shield.
484100	488000	The problem was all centered around one mechanic.
488000	490200	In a word, shields.
490200	495200	Bloodborne, a game about injecting yourself with increasing amounts of dangerous liquid,
495200	497900	is itself the ultimate gateway drug,
497900	502900	giving you a high that essentially turns the game into a socially acceptable drug.
502900	507300	A good deal of players will spend a lot of time with their shield up, playing it safe,
507300	512000	waiting for only the best possible moment to drop it, strike, and then bring it back up again.
512000	516200	Gamers throw up their shield and dance around the enemy until there's an opening,
516200	520200	they stab, they put the shield back up, rinse, and repeat.
520200	522800	Maybe you shouldn't have rinsed and repeated my video, Luke.
522800	526100	The almost inevitable death of this guy's hand...
526100	530400	things immediately communicates that you're going to be facing seemingly insurmountable odds.
530400	536200	Immediately be greeted by a giant beast who would crush them repeatedly.
536200	538600	He talks about how uninviting the previous games are,
538600	541300	and how much they hammer home that you're gonna die like I did,
541300	545700	but as we learn later, he never played the previous games before Bloodborne,
545700	548000	so to get across how uninvited he was,
548000	552200	he has to use footage from the first game he played, which is Bloodborne.
552200	557400	He's using footage of the game he's trying to say made the series more inviting
557400	560700	to prove that the previous games were uninviting.
560700	563900	Also, um, immediately greeted with a giant beast?
563900	567900	Uh, Gasqueagni isn't a giant by Souls game standards.
567900	569800	You don't encounter him immediately,
569800	573400	and he only even transforms into this monster after two-thirds of the fight.
573400	576000	Luke, this is fucking nonsense. What are you doing?
576000	577000	This is a weird thing.
577000	580100	Like, when I'm talking about people's inability to get into the games
580100	582200	and how those people are dismissed by fanboys,
582200	585100	I use footage from on the bridge in Demon's Souls.
585100	587400	When he's saying what I said, but worse,
587400	591100	he's using footage from a very similar area in Dark Souls 3.
591100	593600	Why he thought to do that, I don't know.
593600	597000	I guess he thought I used that footage for a good reason, so he had to as well.
597100	598300	Well, uh, spoilers.
598300	600500	I used that footage completely at random
600500	602300	because I had no idea what to put there.
602300	603800	So, uh, well done.
603800	606800	You even managed to copy my laziness.
606800	607600	Idiot.
607600	610000	So he's just copied the bit on the bridge, right?
610000	612000	That bit ends in my video like this.
612000	613900	Then Bloodborne happened.
613900	616200	♪♪
616200	618000	I introduced Bloodborne, which, by the way,
618000	619500	came out before Dark Souls 3,
619500	621600	the game you were using footage from there, Luke.
621600	625200	Uh, the music cuts to music from the game to be dramatic,
625200	627700	and then I fade to the opening sequence of Bloodborne.
627700	630600	Luke, copying not just my points, but their pacing and order,
630600	633900	introduces Bloodborne and then uses an audio cue from Bloodborne,
633900	637400	which I think is the only time he even thinks to do it in the video,
637400	639200	when he's copying what I did.
639200	643200	And they responded in 2015 with Bloodborne.
645000	647600	And then talks over the same piece of footage as me
647600	650600	about what Bloodborne did and about how Miyazaki fixed the problem.
650600	652500	In my video, I outline play conditioning here
652500	654900	and slowly whittle down the problems that lead to people
654900	657600	not enjoying the Souls games into early design elements
657600	660100	and the shield, using examples of how other people
660100	662100	who started on the earlier games played it.
662100	664200	He just goes, oh, no, the problem's shields.
664200	665900	Now, he played Bloodborne first,
665900	667700	so how he knows shields are a problem,
667700	670300	having only played that one and Dark Souls 3 afterwards,
670300	672200	I don't know. My ideas and argument
672200	673900	are so poorly mangled at this point,
673900	676700	it's a little embarrassing to think he got the idea from me.
676700	679400	Then he rips off my jokey anecdote
679400	682000	about Miyazaki in a boardroom meeting.
682100	683900	Can you imagine being in the room
683900	686700	when hit attacker Miyazaki was looking at playtest footage
686700	690400	of the previous games and coming up with the concept for Bloodborne
690400	694200	and he was like, hey, hey, take out the shields?
694200	696800	Bad jokes aside, I can just picture the day
696800	699400	that Miyazaki walked into the conference room,
699400	701200	sat down at the head of the table,
701200	704600	looked left, looked right at all of his development leads
704600	708700	and just said, get rid of the shields.
708700	711100	No shields ever. None.
711100	713100	Okay, one shield, but it's a joke.
713100	715300	Put a joke in the arm description about them
715300	717500	engendering passivity. Passivity.
717500	718800	God, I can't do this voice.
718800	720900	They took away all the shields in the game.
720900	723300	Well, except for one in the base game,
723300	726600	which proves my point with its in-game description,
726600	728300	which reads, quote,
728300	732300	shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity.
732300	734600	My joke about what Miyazaki might say in a boardroom
734600	736500	segs directly into this point.
736500	738300	I make it into part of the joke, actually,
738300	740900	and have him say that in the boardroom meeting.
740900	744400	Luke just awkwardly segs from his half-hearted ripoff
744400	746900	of that section to just be suddenly talking
746900	748500	about the shields item description.
748500	750100	He isn't just copying what I say.
750100	752200	He's copying the order I say it in.
752200	753600	It wouldn't really have been that hard
753600	755100	for him to make it less obvious.
755100	757000	The immediate next section of my video
757000	758500	is about the rallying system.
758500	760200	Right after the item description,
760200	763300	he immediately fades into talking about the rally system,
763300	765200	even using the exact same method
765200	766900	of enlarging the health bar on the screen
766900	768300	to demonstrate it better.
768300	769700	I'm sure other people do this,
769700	772200	but doing it immediately after badly copying
772200	773500	a bunch of my talking points
773500	775600	and also the order I say them in?
775600	778500	Yeah, I wonder where Luke got this idea from.
778500	780200	And I can personally attest to this.
780200	783100	I had never played a Souls game before I played Bloodborne,
783100	784600	and once I finished Bloodborne,
784600	786200	I felt like a god.
786200	788500	I wanted more. I wanted to taste that drug
788500	790300	that I was talking about earlier again.
790300	792000	So I went and I played Dark Souls 3
792000	793700	in the span of a couple of weekends.
793800	797100	I became consumed with the series.
797100	799900	His personal attestment doesn't make any sense.
799900	801600	If he hadn't played the previous games,
801600	803300	how would he know they were uninviting
803300	804400	or not fun to play,
804400	806200	or how they would have conditioned him?
806200	808400	He was smart enough to know not to steal my story
808400	810300	about having a friend who tried the previous games
810300	811900	and didn't enjoy them and then went back
811900	813800	after Bloodborne to find he suddenly did,
813800	815600	but not smart enough to substitute it
815600	817700	with an anecdote that makes any sense at all.
817700	819700	Additionally, in what is my real problem
819700	820700	with his work here,
820700	823200	his version of my arguments rest on hearsay
823200	825500	and general ideas with no examples given
825500	827600	and no experiences of his own to relate to
827600	829500	about the games or examples of problems
829500	830900	with the previous games,
830900	832500	except, of course, that they have shields
832500	834000	and encourage their overuse,
834000	836200	which he just psychically knows is the problem
836200	838800	despite having never played the previous games.
838800	841500	He mangles my longer and more rigorous discussion
841500	842800	of shields so badly,
842800	844800	he essentially argues that shields are bad
844800	846800	because they help with defense at all,
846800	848600	missing my point that they're fine,
848600	851500	but the previous games' design encourages overuse.
851500	853700	These mistakes transform my ideas
853700	856100	into versions incredibly easy for commenters
856100	857400	to pick holes in.
857400	859800	Inadvertently, this video is like a straw man version
859800	860900	of my argument,
860900	862200	but completely accidentally
862200	864500	because he's trying to legitimately make it
864500	866800	because he didn't understand what he was stealing,
866800	868600	unless, of course, Lukeypoo is destined
868600	871100	to be an excellent contributor to design theory
871100	873100	and just needed to get a foot in the door,
873100	875700	which simply happened to be my foot.
875700	876600	I dunno.
876600	879800	I'd honestly preferred if you'd stolen more of my ideas.
879900	883000	As it stands, this video is just insulting to its audience
883000	884700	and the ideas you're trying to present.
884700	886600	I'm not mad I was plagiarized, really.
886600	888500	I am being a bit hyperbolic here,
888500	891500	but I am a little annoyed about the effects of plagiarism.
891500	892900	Not to get too apocalyptic,
892900	894500	but to me, a cardinal sin
894500	896100	is to make an idea look weak
896100	897900	simply by presenting it poorly.
897900	900000	I want to make videos where if I saw them,
900000	901900	I'd be convinced and learn something
901900	903700	and it would further a wider conversation
903700	906300	about design or culture or whatever else
906300	908100	the hell I'm talking about most the time.
908100	909300	If I saw this video,
909300	912200	I'd think the idea was full of shit and write it off.
912200	913600	I didn't talk about this much before
913600	916200	because I didn't like the idea of going after people,
916200	917600	you know, but Bob's right.
917600	919300	If we don't talk about this when it happens
919300	920900	and create that sort of culture,
920900	923200	there's even less to stop this going on,
923200	925600	and I like discussion and furthering of ideas.
925600	928600	I want to see play conditioning looked at more closely
928600	930200	so its parameters can be explored
930200	932300	and shown in relation to other games,
932300	935500	not more people just re-coming up with it
935500	937600	in regards to the same game, even.
937600	939600	The two most upvoted comments on that video
939600	941500	are a comment making fun of how my video
941500	944300	often finds itself in the related videos section of his
944300	945600	and a comment by me,
945600	947900	and honestly, having me in your comment section
947900	948900	is punishment enough.
951700	953900	The economics of YouTube present a problem
953900	955400	for the content of YouTube
955400	957300	and the wider social conversations
957300	958800	taking place through the medium.
958800	961300	If you want to make a living on this shitty website,
961300	963600	it's currently set up so that the best business practice
963600	966200	is to see what's popular and make something similar,
966200	968400	often disgustingly similar.
968400	971500	This stunts creativity and originality.
971500	973700	Soul Brother's video essays are just a small piece
973700	974800	of the stuff he makes.
974800	977700	Most of the time, he's making high-effort redubs of anime
977700	980400	or cool little animated things that are difficult to copy
980400	982600	and not many people would even think to copy
982600	984900	because they're far from the most popular thing he does,
984900	986700	but that kind of attitude,
986700	988500	making what you feel is worth making,
988500	991400	is an important one to have in a space widely dominated
991400	992900	by people trying to make a living
992900	994900	by being what already did well,
994900	997600	but, you know, again and with their face on it.
997600	999800	In days of old, entertainers and writers
999800	1002700	would measure success by how well-regarded their work was
1002700	1004500	or in how much the wider discussion
1004500	1006400	was furthered by their contribution.
1006400	1007600	Nowadays, you measure success
1007600	1009700	by the amount of imitators you launched.
1009700	1013000	So, special thanks to number-one Hbomberguy fan, Lookipoo.
1013000	1014800	I wish him best of luck in his endeavors
1014800	1016600	and hope he himself will one day
1016600	1018400	produce something worth stealing.
1018400	1019400	I doubt it, though.
1019400	1022300	I mean, Jesus Christ, this video is poorly made.
1022300	1025900	You used the same audio loop for, like, eight straight minutes.
1025900	1027400	Hey, Lookipoo, I know this guy
1027400	1029500	who does some really great editing workshops.
1029500	1031100	Look him up, his name's Soulbrother.
