00:00.000 --> 00:01.540
Let's talk about plagiarism for a bit.

00:01.540 --> 00:03.880
In case you're not hip to all the best YouTube drama,

00:03.880 --> 00:08.000
a video game YouTuber called Weegee the God put out a video recently entitled

00:08.000 --> 00:09.840
Why the Blue Yeti Sucks.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.080
The video is incredibly obnoxious, and this is me we're talking about here.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.800
The Blue Yeti is a $100 stainless steel toy.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.080
Everything good you heard about it, forget it.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.420
They're lies born from hobbyists with no concept of quality.

00:22.420 --> 00:25.920
Along with dismissing a fairly decent and affordable USB microphone

00:25.920 --> 00:29.160
for newer or young people who don't need professional quality,

00:29.160 --> 00:32.080
his voice is in this annoyingly performative tone,

00:32.080 --> 00:34.360
his audio is noticeably overproduced,

00:34.360 --> 00:38.740
and every sentence ends with him smugly droning the final word,

00:38.740 --> 00:41.780
and it's super grating to listen to.

00:41.780 --> 00:45.860
But worse than any of that, almost all the video's content, style, arguments,

00:45.860 --> 00:47.580
and research is stolen.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.160
I'm here to tell you the Blue Yeti is a $100 stainless steel toy.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.960
Everything good you heard about it, forget it.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.660
They're lies born from hobbyists with no concept of quality.

00:55.660 --> 00:58.280
There's a lesser-known YouTuber called Soul Brother Number 3.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.160
I've been a pretty big fan of his for over a year.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.900
I used a Blue Yeti for a while until seeing his video series,

01:02.900 --> 01:04.400
How to Be an Online Voice Actor,

01:04.400 --> 01:06.820
and taking notes about the results of better acoustics,

01:06.820 --> 01:09.160
placement, and the value of XLR microphones.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.400
In fact, when I was looking for a good preamp late last year,

01:11.400 --> 01:14.360
I paused one of his cutaway shots of his own setup

01:14.360 --> 01:16.620
and found a version of that one on eBay.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.580
He made a video about how to use DSLRs,

01:18.580 --> 01:20.400
and even though I haven't used those for a while,

01:20.400 --> 01:23.200
I got into Samyang lenses as a result of him mentioning them.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.440
Here's me plagiarizing that shot from the video with the exact same lens.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.820
I'm beginning to think I might be a little obsessed with this guy.

01:28.820 --> 01:30.860
I've seen all of his videos multiple times,

01:30.860 --> 01:32.520
so when this video got on my radar,

01:32.520 --> 01:36.060
I immediately noticed that not only did he rip off Soul Brother's style,

01:36.060 --> 01:39.560
but he even stole entire lines and sentences.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.740
Here he is ripping off really basic things you could have changed to hide it,

01:43.740 --> 01:48.200
like the diagrams and method of highlighting examples while talking about them.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.200
It's utterly absurd how much of a ripoff this is.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.980
When someone pointed this out to Ouija,

01:52.980 --> 01:55.060
as if he needed to be told he'd done this,

01:55.060 --> 01:57.640
he added the video as a source deep in the description,

01:57.640 --> 01:59.680
claiming he quotes and references him.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.320
Yeah, and Diesel was just quoting and referencing Stardust Crusaders, too.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.100
The really shitty thing about this, though,

02:06.100 --> 02:09.480
is that it completely reappropriates Soul Brother's ultimate point.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.900
The source videos are fun and useful tutorials

02:11.900 --> 02:14.480
with the intent of informing and helping a group of people

02:14.480 --> 02:15.980
that could benefit from knowing.

02:15.980 --> 02:18.280
The fact the Blue Yeti isn't the apex of quality

02:18.280 --> 02:20.480
is worth talking about when discussing the craft,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.740
and more importantly, elevating voice acting to a craft

02:23.740 --> 02:25.280
is a really great thing to do.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.780
It's just a for-fun or Skype microphone.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.580
It's, to actually quote Soul Brother, a toy.

02:31.580 --> 02:35.280
Ouija's version of the video makes this the front-and-center argument.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.540
The function of the video has become a long and unnecessary takedown of a microphone.

02:40.540 --> 02:43.740
The advice Ouija repackaged was good, very good,

02:43.740 --> 02:48.500
but it's been repackaged into a rant about a popular consumer-grade microphone.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.740
That's probably the most offensive part of this.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.120
One of the best tutorials on the Internet

02:53.160 --> 02:57.160
has literally become a footnote in garbage clickbait.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.000
If that isn't the Internet's effect on truth and reason in microcosm,

03:01.000 --> 03:02.500
then I don't know what is.

03:02.500 --> 03:07.580
Now, you notice how this sounds all nice and clean and clear

03:07.580 --> 03:11.120
and how this sounds like absolute total garbage?

03:11.120 --> 03:15.740
Ouija the God there, comparing a very expensive professional microphone setup

03:15.740 --> 03:17.880
to a microphone that sounds fine,

03:17.880 --> 03:21.080
especially compared to other USB microphones in that price range,

03:21.080 --> 03:23.540
or, you know, no microphone at all.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.840
Well, that right there is the difference between a toy

03:26.840 --> 03:29.340
and a real audio setup.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.240
Yes, that right there is the difference,

03:32.240 --> 03:37.380
and we call that difference $650 US!

03:37.380 --> 03:39.740
If you want to know what intellectual honesty looks like,

03:39.740 --> 03:42.660
you know that video I said inspired me to spend far too much money

03:42.660 --> 03:44.160
on some nice manual lenses?

03:44.160 --> 03:46.160
You can't watch that video anymore

03:46.160 --> 03:49.000
because Soul Brother took it down for some slight errors.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.160
Imagine that, Ouija, taking down a video because it's got mistakes in it.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.800
Can you imagine what it must be like to be that?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.160
CAN YOU FUCKING IMAGINE?!

03:57.160 --> 03:59.260
But if you're a fan of Soul Brother like I am,

03:59.260 --> 04:01.760
this isn't the first time his work has been plagiarized.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.580
In December last year, a video entitled

04:03.580 --> 04:05.580
What Happened to Kentucky Fried Chicken?

04:05.580 --> 04:08.540
made by Austin McConnell came out and went pretty viral.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.340
It currently has over 1.7 million views.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.580
Watching it, someone intimately familiar with Soul Brother's style

04:14.580 --> 04:17.580
will instantly recognize flourishes and stylistic choices

04:17.580 --> 04:19.240
all but unique to him.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.500
All right, check it out, so...

04:20.500 --> 04:21.420
All right, so check it.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.200
Talent, equipment, and availability.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.460
Showing weakness in any of these can manifest itself

04:25.460 --> 04:26.660
in you not getting paid.

04:26.660 --> 04:30.500
There are five keys to the success of your average fast food joint.

04:30.500 --> 04:34.420
Fail in any of these areas and folks aren't gonna wanna buy your product.

04:34.420 --> 04:38.380
Recognizable enough that someone noticed this and tipped Soul Brother off.

04:38.380 --> 04:41.880
When he asked him about it, McConnell openly claimed him as an inspiration.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.740
Now, this is an interesting creative gray area.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.960
No one's on the hook for being inspired by someone else's style or work,

04:48.960 --> 04:53.500
but completely jacking someone's style for attention is certainly a bad look.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.340
It's not uncommon in the YouTube community for someone to borrow

04:56.340 --> 04:58.840
someone else's ideas if they seem good or popular.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.580
The guy who first decided to overreact to Five Nights at Freddy's footage

05:02.580 --> 05:05.300
probably founded numerous careers for several people,

05:05.300 --> 05:07.220
including that of the game's creator.

05:07.220 --> 05:11.460
You really can't copyright a style or ideas, and that's a good thing.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.380
McConnell's poor ripoff is still better than the stuff he used to make

05:14.400 --> 05:15.940
before he was stealing stuff,

05:15.940 --> 05:19.540
and the YouTube jump-scare economy has provided entertainment for millions.

05:19.540 --> 05:23.080
But there's a difference between saying something new and unique to you

05:23.080 --> 05:27.500
using a style inspired by others and trying to be someone else.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.460
This comic persona is occasionally entertaining,

05:30.460 --> 05:32.620
but it's Soul Brother's comic persona.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.960
There's an unwritten rule in creative communities

05:34.960 --> 05:37.260
that this sort of thing makes you kind of a dick.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.720
Additionally, the very poor pacing and length of the video

05:39.720 --> 05:42.760
makes the style he assumed drag more than it should.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.980
It starts to feel repetitive and overly long,

05:44.980 --> 05:48.200
even though it's only eight minutes, which is something of an achievement.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.400
Style and tone and pacing are hard to master,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.900
and in borrowing surface elements from Soul Brother,

05:52.900 --> 05:56.280
he fails to accurately capture what makes that method good in the first place.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.040
He cites Soul Brother as an inspiration,

05:58.040 --> 06:00.360
and I strongly suspect that with time,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.660
McConnell will figure out a style that suits him better

06:02.660 --> 06:05.200
and is more appropriate for the work he ends up making.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.620
If you want to learn some useful tips about voice acting or audio setups

06:08.620 --> 06:12.000
or editing or writing or filmmaking, you can learn directly from the best.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.420
Soul Brother does workshops for $80 a piece,

06:14.420 --> 06:16.740
and I know people who can vouch for them being worth the money.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.080
Check the description for a link and some testimonials.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.660
So there's the first two stories about two very different kinds of plagiarism.

06:22.660 --> 06:27.220
I could bring up that this is a problem that the YouTube rational skeptic community also has,

06:27.220 --> 06:30.600
and lots of them are constantly accusing each other of ripping off their shtick.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.340
What a shock! They're so intellectually honest otherwise!

06:33.340 --> 06:36.640
But my third story today is gonna be mine, because I'm selfish.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.680
A couple days ago, friend and estranged lover Bob Vids

06:39.680 --> 06:42.860
put out a video noting the similarities and criticizing Ouija.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.160
It's pretty good. Check it out.

06:44.160 --> 06:49.200
My original plan for this video was to just remake his entire video word-for-word for a joke,

06:49.200 --> 06:53.280
but toward the end, he made the comment that without building attitudes to calling out plagiarism

06:53.280 --> 06:56.380
when it happens in the YouTube community, it's never gonna get discussed properly,

06:56.380 --> 07:00.700
and I'd much rather contribute to that than putting a lot of effort into a silly joke.

07:00.700 --> 07:01.880
So, here.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.800
You might recall my amazing video about why Bloodborne's great.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.600
It was very well-received, creatively and culturally, and changed the world.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.400
One thing that most enthused scholars was my introduction and codification

07:13.400 --> 07:16.780
of a concept in game design theory I called play conditioning.

07:16.780 --> 07:21.780
My theory was sound, no one could possibly criticize it because it's perfect, and everyone loved it.

07:21.780 --> 07:26.100
So, of course, like with all beautiful and perfect ideas, someone stole it!

07:26.100 --> 07:28.100
Let me introduce you to Lookipoo.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.500
His video, Bloodborne Did Something Incredible,

07:30.500 --> 07:34.700
is a cheap knockoff of the general thesis of my video and of play conditioning,

07:34.700 --> 07:37.300
presenting it as if he just suddenly came up with it,

07:37.300 --> 07:41.600
coincidentally in regards to the same game as me, four months after I did.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.300
Found them overly esoteric and difficult in a way that wasn't fun,

07:45.300 --> 07:48.700
and full of overly defensive, get-good-spouting fanboys, and

07:48.700 --> 07:53.700
these people seem to be hardcore, get-good-preaching, masochistic troglodytes

07:53.700 --> 07:57.000
who members of the Souls community don't even recognize,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.400
rebutting it with a simple, get-good.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.400
Firstly, the most obvious one.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.100
There's no shield.

08:04.100 --> 08:08.000
The problem was all centered around one mechanic.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.200
In a word, shields.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.200
Bloodborne, a game about injecting yourself with increasing amounts of dangerous liquid,

08:15.200 --> 08:17.900
is itself the ultimate gateway drug,

08:17.900 --> 08:22.900
giving you a high that essentially turns the game into a socially acceptable drug.

08:22.900 --> 08:27.300
A good deal of players will spend a lot of time with their shield up, playing it safe,

08:27.300 --> 08:32.000
waiting for only the best possible moment to drop it, strike, and then bring it back up again.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.200
Gamers throw up their shield and dance around the enemy until there's an opening,

08:36.200 --> 08:40.200
they stab, they put the shield back up, rinse, and repeat.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.800
Maybe you shouldn't have rinsed and repeated my video, Luke.

08:42.800 --> 08:46.100
The almost inevitable death of this guy's hand...

08:46.100 --> 08:50.400
things immediately communicates that you're going to be facing seemingly insurmountable odds.

08:50.400 --> 08:56.200
Immediately be greeted by a giant beast who would crush them repeatedly.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.600
He talks about how uninviting the previous games are,

08:58.600 --> 09:01.300
and how much they hammer home that you're gonna die like I did,

09:01.300 --> 09:05.700
but as we learn later, he never played the previous games before Bloodborne,

09:05.700 --> 09:08.000
so to get across how uninvited he was,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.200
he has to use footage from the first game he played, which is Bloodborne.

09:12.200 --> 09:17.400
He's using footage of the game he's trying to say made the series more inviting

09:17.400 --> 09:20.700
to prove that the previous games were uninviting.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.900
Also, um, immediately greeted with a giant beast?

09:23.900 --> 09:27.900
Uh, Gasqueagni isn't a giant by Souls game standards.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.800
You don't encounter him immediately,

09:29.800 --> 09:33.400
and he only even transforms into this monster after two-thirds of the fight.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.000
Luke, this is fucking nonsense. What are you doing?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
This is a weird thing.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.100
Like, when I'm talking about people's inability to get into the games

09:40.100 --> 09:42.200
and how those people are dismissed by fanboys,

09:42.200 --> 09:45.100
I use footage from on the bridge in Demon's Souls.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.400
When he's saying what I said, but worse,

09:47.400 --> 09:51.100
he's using footage from a very similar area in Dark Souls 3.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.600
Why he thought to do that, I don't know.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.000
I guess he thought I used that footage for a good reason, so he had to as well.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.300
Well, uh, spoilers.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.500
I used that footage completely at random

10:00.500 --> 10:02.300
because I had no idea what to put there.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.800
So, uh, well done.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.800
You even managed to copy my laziness.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.600
Idiot.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.000
So he's just copied the bit on the bridge, right?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That bit ends in my video like this.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.900
Then Bloodborne happened.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.200
♪♪

10:16.200 --> 10:18.000
I introduced Bloodborne, which, by the way,

10:18.000 --> 10:19.500
came out before Dark Souls 3,

10:19.500 --> 10:21.600
the game you were using footage from there, Luke.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.200
Uh, the music cuts to music from the game to be dramatic,

10:25.200 --> 10:27.700
and then I fade to the opening sequence of Bloodborne.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.600
Luke, copying not just my points, but their pacing and order,

10:30.600 --> 10:33.900
introduces Bloodborne and then uses an audio cue from Bloodborne,

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
which I think is the only time he even thinks to do it in the video,

10:37.400 --> 10:39.200
when he's copying what I did.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.200
And they responded in 2015 with Bloodborne.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.600
And then talks over the same piece of footage as me

10:47.600 --> 10:50.600
about what Bloodborne did and about how Miyazaki fixed the problem.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.500
In my video, I outline play conditioning here

10:52.500 --> 10:54.900
and slowly whittle down the problems that lead to people

10:54.900 --> 10:57.600
not enjoying the Souls games into early design elements

10:57.600 --> 11:00.100
and the shield, using examples of how other people

11:00.100 --> 11:02.100
who started on the earlier games played it.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.200
He just goes, oh, no, the problem's shields.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.900
Now, he played Bloodborne first,

11:05.900 --> 11:07.700
so how he knows shields are a problem,

11:07.700 --> 11:10.300
having only played that one and Dark Souls 3 afterwards,

11:10.300 --> 11:12.200
I don't know. My ideas and argument

11:12.200 --> 11:13.900
are so poorly mangled at this point,

11:13.900 --> 11:16.700
it's a little embarrassing to think he got the idea from me.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.400
Then he rips off my jokey anecdote

11:19.400 --> 11:22.000
about Miyazaki in a boardroom meeting.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.900
Can you imagine being in the room

11:23.900 --> 11:26.700
when hit attacker Miyazaki was looking at playtest footage

11:26.700 --> 11:30.400
of the previous games and coming up with the concept for Bloodborne

11:30.400 --> 11:34.200
and he was like, hey, hey, take out the shields?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.800
Bad jokes aside, I can just picture the day

11:36.800 --> 11:39.400
that Miyazaki walked into the conference room,

11:39.400 --> 11:41.200
sat down at the head of the table,

11:41.200 --> 11:44.600
looked left, looked right at all of his development leads

11:44.600 --> 11:48.700
and just said, get rid of the shields.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.100
No shields ever. None.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.100
Okay, one shield, but it's a joke.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.300
Put a joke in the arm description about them

11:55.300 --> 11:57.500
engendering passivity. Passivity.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.800
God, I can't do this voice.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.900
They took away all the shields in the game.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.300
Well, except for one in the base game,

12:03.300 --> 12:06.600
which proves my point with its in-game description,

12:06.600 --> 12:08.300
which reads, quote,

12:08.300 --> 12:12.300
shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.600
My joke about what Miyazaki might say in a boardroom

12:14.600 --> 12:16.500
segs directly into this point.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.300
I make it into part of the joke, actually,

12:18.300 --> 12:20.900
and have him say that in the boardroom meeting.

12:20.900 --> 12:24.400
Luke just awkwardly segs from his half-hearted ripoff

12:24.400 --> 12:26.900
of that section to just be suddenly talking

12:26.900 --> 12:28.500
about the shields item description.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.100
He isn't just copying what I say.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.200
He's copying the order I say it in.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.600
It wouldn't really have been that hard

12:33.600 --> 12:35.100
for him to make it less obvious.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.000
The immediate next section of my video

12:37.000 --> 12:38.500
is about the rallying system.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.200
Right after the item description,

12:40.200 --> 12:43.300
he immediately fades into talking about the rally system,

12:43.300 --> 12:45.200
even using the exact same method

12:45.200 --> 12:46.900
of enlarging the health bar on the screen

12:46.900 --> 12:48.300
to demonstrate it better.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.700
I'm sure other people do this,

12:49.700 --> 12:52.200
but doing it immediately after badly copying

12:52.200 --> 12:53.500
a bunch of my talking points

12:53.500 --> 12:55.600
and also the order I say them in?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.500
Yeah, I wonder where Luke got this idea from.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.200
And I can personally attest to this.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.100
I had never played a Souls game before I played Bloodborne,

13:03.100 --> 13:04.600
and once I finished Bloodborne,

13:04.600 --> 13:06.200
I felt like a god.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.500
I wanted more. I wanted to taste that drug

13:08.500 --> 13:10.300
that I was talking about earlier again.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.000
So I went and I played Dark Souls 3

13:12.000 --> 13:13.700
in the span of a couple of weekends.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.100
I became consumed with the series.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.900
His personal attestment doesn't make any sense.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.600
If he hadn't played the previous games,

13:21.600 --> 13:23.300
how would he know they were uninviting

13:23.300 --> 13:24.400
or not fun to play,

13:24.400 --> 13:26.200
or how they would have conditioned him?

13:26.200 --> 13:28.400
He was smart enough to know not to steal my story

13:28.400 --> 13:30.300
about having a friend who tried the previous games

13:30.300 --> 13:31.900
and didn't enjoy them and then went back

13:31.900 --> 13:33.800
after Bloodborne to find he suddenly did,

13:33.800 --> 13:35.600
but not smart enough to substitute it

13:35.600 --> 13:37.700
with an anecdote that makes any sense at all.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.700
Additionally, in what is my real problem

13:39.700 --> 13:40.700
with his work here,

13:40.700 --> 13:43.200
his version of my arguments rest on hearsay

13:43.200 --> 13:45.500
and general ideas with no examples given

13:45.500 --> 13:47.600
and no experiences of his own to relate to

13:47.600 --> 13:49.500
about the games or examples of problems

13:49.500 --> 13:50.900
with the previous games,

13:50.900 --> 13:52.500
except, of course, that they have shields

13:52.500 --> 13:54.000
and encourage their overuse,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.200
which he just psychically knows is the problem

13:56.200 --> 13:58.800
despite having never played the previous games.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.500
He mangles my longer and more rigorous discussion

14:01.500 --> 14:02.800
of shields so badly,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
he essentially argues that shields are bad

14:04.800 --> 14:06.800
because they help with defense at all,

14:06.800 --> 14:08.600
missing my point that they're fine,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.500
but the previous games' design encourages overuse.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.700
These mistakes transform my ideas

14:13.700 --> 14:16.100
into versions incredibly easy for commenters

14:16.100 --> 14:17.400
to pick holes in.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.800
Inadvertently, this video is like a straw man version

14:19.800 --> 14:20.900
of my argument,

14:20.900 --> 14:22.200
but completely accidentally

14:22.200 --> 14:24.500
because he's trying to legitimately make it

14:24.500 --> 14:26.800
because he didn't understand what he was stealing,

14:26.800 --> 14:28.600
unless, of course, Lukeypoo is destined

14:28.600 --> 14:31.100
to be an excellent contributor to design theory

14:31.100 --> 14:33.100
and just needed to get a foot in the door,

14:33.100 --> 14:35.700
which simply happened to be my foot.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.600
I dunno.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.800
I'd honestly preferred if you'd stolen more of my ideas.

14:39.900 --> 14:43.000
As it stands, this video is just insulting to its audience

14:43.000 --> 14:44.700
and the ideas you're trying to present.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.600
I'm not mad I was plagiarized, really.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.500
I am being a bit hyperbolic here,

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
but I am a little annoyed about the effects of plagiarism.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.900
Not to get too apocalyptic,

14:52.900 --> 14:54.500
but to me, a cardinal sin

14:54.500 --> 14:56.100
is to make an idea look weak

14:56.100 --> 14:57.900
simply by presenting it poorly.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.000
I want to make videos where if I saw them,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.900
I'd be convinced and learn something

15:01.900 --> 15:03.700
and it would further a wider conversation

15:03.700 --> 15:06.300
about design or culture or whatever else

15:06.300 --> 15:08.100
the hell I'm talking about most the time.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.300
If I saw this video,

15:09.300 --> 15:12.200
I'd think the idea was full of shit and write it off.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.600
I didn't talk about this much before

15:13.600 --> 15:16.200
because I didn't like the idea of going after people,

15:16.200 --> 15:17.600
you know, but Bob's right.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.300
If we don't talk about this when it happens

15:19.300 --> 15:20.900
and create that sort of culture,

15:20.900 --> 15:23.200
there's even less to stop this going on,

15:23.200 --> 15:25.600
and I like discussion and furthering of ideas.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.600
I want to see play conditioning looked at more closely

15:28.600 --> 15:30.200
so its parameters can be explored

15:30.200 --> 15:32.300
and shown in relation to other games,

15:32.300 --> 15:35.500
not more people just re-coming up with it

15:35.500 --> 15:37.600
in regards to the same game, even.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.600
The two most upvoted comments on that video

15:39.600 --> 15:41.500
are a comment making fun of how my video

15:41.500 --> 15:44.300
often finds itself in the related videos section of his

15:44.300 --> 15:45.600
and a comment by me,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.900
and honestly, having me in your comment section

15:47.900 --> 15:48.900
is punishment enough.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.900
The economics of YouTube present a problem

15:53.900 --> 15:55.400
for the content of YouTube

15:55.400 --> 15:57.300
and the wider social conversations

15:57.300 --> 15:58.800
taking place through the medium.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.300
If you want to make a living on this shitty website,

16:01.300 --> 16:03.600
it's currently set up so that the best business practice

16:03.600 --> 16:06.200
is to see what's popular and make something similar,

16:06.200 --> 16:08.400
often disgustingly similar.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.500
This stunts creativity and originality.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.700
Soul Brother's video essays are just a small piece

16:13.700 --> 16:14.800
of the stuff he makes.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.700
Most of the time, he's making high-effort redubs of anime

16:17.700 --> 16:20.400
or cool little animated things that are difficult to copy

16:20.400 --> 16:22.600
and not many people would even think to copy

16:22.600 --> 16:24.900
because they're far from the most popular thing he does,

16:24.900 --> 16:26.700
but that kind of attitude,

16:26.700 --> 16:28.500
making what you feel is worth making,

16:28.500 --> 16:31.400
is an important one to have in a space widely dominated

16:31.400 --> 16:32.900
by people trying to make a living

16:32.900 --> 16:34.900
by being what already did well,

16:34.900 --> 16:37.600
but, you know, again and with their face on it.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.800
In days of old, entertainers and writers

16:39.800 --> 16:42.700
would measure success by how well-regarded their work was

16:42.700 --> 16:44.500
or in how much the wider discussion

16:44.500 --> 16:46.400
was furthered by their contribution.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.600
Nowadays, you measure success

16:47.600 --> 16:49.700
by the amount of imitators you launched.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.000
So, special thanks to number-one Hbomberguy fan, Lookipoo.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.800
I wish him best of luck in his endeavors

16:54.800 --> 16:56.600
and hope he himself will one day

16:56.600 --> 16:58.400
produce something worth stealing.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.400
I doubt it, though.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.300
I mean, Jesus Christ, this video is poorly made.

17:02.300 --> 17:05.900
You used the same audio loop for, like, eight straight minutes.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.400
Hey, Lookipoo, I know this guy

17:07.400 --> 17:09.500
who does some really great editing workshops.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.100
Look him up, his name's Soulbrother.
