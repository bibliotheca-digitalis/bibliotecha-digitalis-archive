00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
You know, it's been pretty great over the last couple of years developing something of an audience, you know, a following and YouTube subscribers and

00:07.720 --> 00:12.320
fans and people on Twitter who want to know what I have to say about stuff.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.560
But to be honest, it's getting kind of annoying. I'm kind of sick of having them.

00:17.160 --> 00:21.240
So I thought the best way to get rid of them would be to start a new YouTube video series

00:21.540 --> 00:27.040
exploring the theory and philosophy and politics of various aspects of film that I feel aren't explored enough.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.360
That should do the trick and along the way I might remind people of some of my more

00:31.840 --> 00:37.400
contrarian opinions like the fact I think the Star Wars prequels are actually pretty good. Stuff like that. I just did it then, didn't I?

00:38.440 --> 00:40.680
Welcome to Scanline.

00:57.040 --> 01:09.960
If you're older than the age of 20 or have parents that don't throw things out,

01:10.280 --> 01:14.160
then you probably have at least a couple of these things in an attic or a shed somewhere.

01:14.720 --> 01:20.860
These are video home system cassette tapes, commonly known as VHS tapes. They entered use in the late

01:21.320 --> 01:26.200
1970s and were a very popular way of watching films and TV shows in your own home anytime you wanted,

01:26.200 --> 01:29.280
which for the time was a really novel and new concept.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.360
With SelectaVision, you can go to the movies at your house!

01:32.360 --> 01:36.160
I know this because I looked it up on the Wikipedia page when I was writing this script.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.760
But let's get into what the world's largest ence,

01:39.280 --> 01:42.440
Lie-clopedia, doesn't want you to know.

01:47.760 --> 01:53.120
If you weren't in front of the TV when a show aired or hadn't gone to the cinema when a film was out, your primary

01:53.280 --> 01:58.360
interaction with most pieces of modern entertainment and culture would have been through the medium of VHS.

01:58.640 --> 02:05.360
Almost every piece of audio-visual art you consumed, no matter what it was made with, shot on, or how advanced the budget and special effects,

02:05.360 --> 02:09.680
you saw it via the signal produced from the magnetic reels in these plastic boxes.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.440
If you fell in love with a story, it was probably thanks to these tapes.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.680
It's a pity, then, that they look like shit.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.760
A standard PAL VHS recording consisted of roughly 320 horizontal lines and

02:22.400 --> 02:24.400
576 vertical lines of visual information.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.680
Worse, you wouldn't actually be getting your films at that resolution.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.680
Since most films were produced in wide or super wide screen,

02:31.680 --> 02:35.040
but VHS was for the 4x3 resolution of contemporary televisions,

02:35.040 --> 02:37.160
you had a problem even showing a film.

02:37.160 --> 02:41.520
You could crop out the sides of a film and move the screen around, what's called pan and scan,

02:41.520 --> 02:46.200
which could totally ruin the story of films where multiple things were happening on different sides of the frame,

02:46.200 --> 02:49.440
or you could scale the whole thing down and add black bars to the top and bottom,

02:49.680 --> 02:52.160
creating what was called the letterbox effect.

02:52.160 --> 02:56.200
On the pan and scan version of A New Hope, the opening text crawl doesn't fit the screen,

02:56.200 --> 02:59.240
so you have to wait until it gets here before you can even possibly read it.

02:59.240 --> 03:03.880
In the widescreen version, you can see the entire line of text as soon as it enters the frame,

03:03.880 --> 03:06.480
but it's scaled down, so it's just as hard to read.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.640
I always really liked the scene from Aliens where Burke is trying to be friendly with Ripley in hospital,

03:10.640 --> 03:15.160
so he brings Jonesy in and sits backwards in his chair and spins playfully in it while the camera pulls in

03:15.160 --> 03:19.200
and gets more intimate, so he can then tell her that she's been frozen for 57 years.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.360
There's lots of good moments of subtle acting and characterization,

03:22.360 --> 03:27.440
and I like the cinematography of this cool sci-fi room, and there's a cute cat in the frame, too.

03:27.440 --> 03:32.520
The pan and scan version of this scene just barely manages to get both characters in the frame at once.

03:32.520 --> 03:37.800
It completely removes a lot of Burke's body language as he tries to be nice while preparing to break the news to her,

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
and poor Jonesy's head is cut off.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.920
Jonesy isn't in this film after the beginning.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.800
Does Jonesy over here look happy with pan and scan?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.840
I don't think he does, but I can't actually tell.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.920
Even worse, because of the vile machinations of capitalism,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.880
the first preferred solution by movie studios was pan and scan,

03:52.880 --> 03:54.800
so they sold all the films like that,

03:54.800 --> 03:59.120
and then, once they figured out that directors hated having their films recut to fit the new frame

03:59.120 --> 04:03.320
and widescreen was basically objectively superior because it displayed the entire film,

04:03.320 --> 04:08.720
they got to sell you the films all over again with the promise that this time it was better.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.520
Now, for the first time on video,

04:11.520 --> 04:16.640
you can savor the true experience of these blockbusters in their original format.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.200
Widescreen.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.440
My copy of the Aliens special editionâ€”

04:20.440 --> 04:22.920
sorry, the Aliens special edition?

04:22.920 --> 04:25.360
Apparently I bought this tape from a xenomorph?

04:25.360 --> 04:29.560
Opens with a commercial for the widescreen versions of Alien and Die Hard.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.840
Fuckers.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.520
And guess what? This version of Aliens is in pan and scan!

04:34.520 --> 04:36.880
This is already the special edition of Aliens,

04:36.880 --> 04:41.760
and now you're telling me I'm gonna have to buy it again when the widescreen special edition comes out?

04:41.800 --> 04:47.600
20th Century Fox? More like 22nd Century Weyland-Yutani?

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
I'm sorry.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.080
And that was it.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.440
That was how people watched films.

04:52.440 --> 04:56.080
They picked their poison between a tiny version of the original film

04:56.080 --> 05:02.680
or a recut, reframed, gutted, despicable, cat-erasing version of the original,

05:02.680 --> 05:06.280
and whichever one you picked, you got it in this flickery format.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.720
You got this facsimile of the film that you wanted to see.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.160
And that was how we consumed media.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.280
For decades.

05:15.280 --> 05:21.240
Some versions of the above-average fantasy film series Star Wars only ever widely existed on this format.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.280
Many fans of Star Wars all over message boards and forums and my mentions

05:25.280 --> 05:28.880
fell in love with the films because of tapes they rented or bought.

05:28.880 --> 05:29.960
Because of this.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.280
But wait a minute.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.200
We can talk about specs and make fun of the video quality all day.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.560
People still watched them, people still used them to record shows off the TV,

05:37.560 --> 05:40.400
and people still shared and circulated those recordings.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.560
Thanks to people wanting to see things and needing tape to do so,

05:43.560 --> 05:48.880
homemade tapes are still the only way to find copies of shows that weren't available in any official format.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.680
Many episodes of Mystery Science Theater didn't get a proper release for years after their initial air date,

05:53.680 --> 05:55.080
and many still don't.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.560
Prior to high-speed internet, the only way of accessing these old episodes

05:58.560 --> 06:02.520
was through home recordings people happened to have made at the time the show aired.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.640
You'd be amazed at what hoops folks would jump through to see a show they liked,

06:05.680 --> 06:07.800
even on a low-res home tape recording.

06:07.800 --> 06:12.400
And what if you were a fan of anime in the era prior to major home video releases of foreign animation?

06:12.400 --> 06:17.040
Why, you would have to hope you knew a store with crazy import stuff with really poor fan translations

06:17.040 --> 06:22.320
or hope someone had taped the shows that did make it over at the crazy times they turned up.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.400
In retrospect, the format wasn't great,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.520
but it was certainly good enough for audiences who wanted to watch something

06:27.520 --> 06:29.880
in the comfort of their own homes whenever they wanted to,

06:29.880 --> 06:33.520
and it was basically the first format that allowed people to do this.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.840
It led to widespread consumption of material that would otherwise be forgotten or go unseen.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.320
In the 70s and 80s, for the first time ever,

06:40.320 --> 06:44.040
a regular person could have an archive of shows or films they enjoyed

06:44.040 --> 06:47.400
without having to get a projector and go in search of film reels on eBay,

06:47.400 --> 06:52.160
which would be really hard to do, considering that eBay didn't exist until 1995.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.280
A person could learn about and consume elements of their culture

06:55.280 --> 06:59.000
and develop an understanding of film so much more easily than the decades prior.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.800
In fact, Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith worked in local video stores before becoming directors,

07:03.800 --> 07:07.240
giving them an opportunity to further incubate their own passion for film

07:07.240 --> 07:09.000
as well as share it directly with others

07:09.000 --> 07:13.960
before going on to make some of the most influential films, for better or worse, of the 1990s.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.000
The advent of VHS ushered in a new era of accessibility for film fans.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.240
Tastes in film and appetites for film could be developed much more rapidly than ever before.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.120
It marked the beginning in a radical and permanent shift in media consumption.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.240
You were no longer reliant on what was playing in your local multiplex

07:29.240 --> 07:32.760
or what old French films the weird art schools were projecting that month,

07:32.760 --> 07:35.480
and you no longer had to adhere rigidly to TV schedules

07:35.480 --> 07:38.960
or catch films or TV shows deigned worthy of being shown.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.760
The shift was so radical that film companies panicked.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.440
Then-MPAA head Jack Valenti, in an act of comical hyperbole,

07:45.440 --> 07:49.160
said in a congressional hearing that the VCR is to the American film producer

07:49.160 --> 07:53.400
and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.160
Universal Studios even sued Sony on the grounds of copyright infringement

07:57.160 --> 07:59.640
over their Betamax video recording format.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.880
Luckily, it was ruled that home recording devices operate under fair use,

08:02.880 --> 08:08.240
and of course, once film companies realized how profitable home video could be, they backed off.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.200
Many films started being made with their sales on the burgeoning

08:11.200 --> 08:14.560
and seemingly never-endingly hungry VHS market in mind,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.480
or even without the intent of ever being screened in a theater.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.200
Some were barely even films.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.960
They were instructional videos or Christmas-themed cat nightmares

08:22.960 --> 08:27.160
or musical propaganda for a Christian cult that lived in the woods.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.560
Lots of popular films did well on tape, but still others did hugely well on tape,

08:31.560 --> 08:35.400
more so than you could expect from their cinematic release or critical reception.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.200
The question here is why.

08:37.200 --> 08:43.200
What is it about being available on VHS that made people suddenly become connoisseurs of horror or independent film?

08:43.200 --> 08:45.080
Well, those reasons tend to get overlooked.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.360
Let's look at some of them right now.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.640
[â™ª Music begins to fade out â™ª

08:49.600 --> 08:53.920
When making the film Jaws, which would come to be regarded as the first ever summer blockbuster,

08:53.920 --> 08:56.760
Spielberg and co. discovered some problems with the shark prop,

08:56.760 --> 09:01.600
a prop many would regard as quite important in a film about a shark that eats people.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.600
The animatronics kept breaking down, bits kept falling off of it,

09:04.600 --> 09:07.400
and most importantly, it kept sinking.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.880
The fake shark had trouble floating in water.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.840
Spielberg instead had to rely on using shots of almost everything but the shark

09:14.840 --> 09:16.920
to demonstrate the horror of its presence,

09:16.920 --> 09:21.280
show the aftermath, show explosions of blood in the distance, show the actor's reactions.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.240
The result was a film where you barely ever get to see the animatronic shark,

09:25.240 --> 09:27.280
but its presence is felt regardless.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.160
The shark is rendered even scarier by not being shown in all its glory,

09:31.160 --> 09:33.880
and its glory wasn't really all that much to see anyway.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.520
It was a broken mechanical shark.

09:36.520 --> 09:41.600
Toby Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an incredibly startling and foundational film in the horror genre.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.320
When James Fuhrman, a British censor and secretary of the BBFC at the time,

09:45.320 --> 09:49.800
tried to cut the film to reduce its violent and nightmarishly oppressive atmosphere,

09:49.800 --> 09:53.640
he found, to his own personal shock, that he couldn't.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.680
There isn't all that much actual violence or blood in the film.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.760
There are no single pieces or shots you could remove to diminish its effects.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.600
Instead, it's a cumulative effect of all the properties of the entire film

10:04.600 --> 10:09.080
in setting a tone and creating a mood without needing to show you anything in particular.

10:09.080 --> 10:13.080
In the end, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was refused a certification by the BBFC,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.560
effectively banning it in the United Kingdom.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.760
What these stories tell us is that even in visual mediums,

10:18.760 --> 10:20.920
supposedly all about showing people things,

10:20.920 --> 10:23.960
for achieving some effects, often less is more.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.840
The human mind is incredibly good at scaring itself,

10:26.840 --> 10:30.520
and sometimes not being shown what you're supposed to be scared of is the worst thing.

10:30.520 --> 10:35.400
Confusion settles in, fear of what could be there, what could happen fills your head,

10:35.400 --> 10:37.960
and your imagination, with its own particular fears,

10:37.960 --> 10:40.520
gets to substitute those over whatever's actually there.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.680
Texas Chainsaw Massacre did fantastically well when it was released in 1981,

10:44.680 --> 10:47.400
allowing many Brits access to the film for the first time,

10:47.400 --> 10:49.080
but many horror films did well on tape,

10:49.080 --> 10:51.880
even if they relied much more on gore or were poorly cut,

10:51.880 --> 10:55.240
and this is because of a particular form of this principle.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.920
Let's think about VHS again.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.720
That awful, tiny resolution, flickery screen,

10:59.720 --> 11:02.040
even pure blackness is off-kilter.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.360
If you walked into a room with this playing,

11:04.360 --> 11:09.160
you might even think you're watching a scene of something hiding in darkness.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.680
I bet you can almost make out a figure hidden there in all the noise.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.440
You see where I'm going with this now, don't you?

11:15.080 --> 11:20.360
Here's Alien, one of the best, most emotionally intense and scary films ever on VHS,

11:20.360 --> 11:24.120
and through these tapes, Alien was flipping terrifying.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.440
I remember being out of my mind scared by this low-res monstrosity,

11:28.440 --> 11:30.760
and it wasn't just because of the great acting,

11:30.760 --> 11:33.240
directing, editing, creature design, or music.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.280
It was because in all the tensest and darkest moments,

11:36.280 --> 11:39.320
you could never really quite be sure what you were looking at.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.520
Abstract shapes in the background could almost look like something else.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.280
The flickers and noise in the darkness

11:44.280 --> 11:46.760
were easily confused for glimpses of the monster.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.000
Even when you were sure nothing was there,

11:49.000 --> 11:50.760
you could never really be sure.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.040
When the monster actually turned up, it was almost a relief.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.840
Like, at least now, you knew where the creature actually was.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.600
-â™ª You never let it go â™ª

11:58.760 --> 12:00.760
-â™ª You never let it go â™ª

12:00.760 --> 12:01.800
Dallas?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.520
In other words, a lower-resolution format

12:04.520 --> 12:07.320
can increase the emotional impact of a scene.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.160
Horror and suspense have the chance to strike people like it never had before.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.400
No wonder films like this did well.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.280
In some ways, modern high-resolution versions of these films

12:16.280 --> 12:18.840
can't quite capture that particular magic.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.760
Here's a scene from the Blu-ray version.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.160
It looks great, but it's not as scary

12:23.160 --> 12:26.360
because you can quite definitely see that nothing's there.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.880
You know the character is alone in ways that you couldn't be certain of before.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.280
Really good films actually put this principle into practice

12:32.280 --> 12:33.720
within the medium itself.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.520
For example, Alien and Aliens both have sequences

12:36.520 --> 12:39.240
that prominently feature the use of cameras and video feeds

12:39.240 --> 12:40.680
with a very poor signal.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.920
Even if the higher-resolution version of the film

12:42.920 --> 12:44.840
does diminish some of the horror elements,

12:44.840 --> 12:48.040
these segments still hold up exactly like they always did

12:48.040 --> 12:50.600
because the effects of viewing low-resolution video

12:50.600 --> 12:52.600
are worked into the aesthetic of the film.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.480
As a kid, David Cronenberg rotated his TV antenna

12:55.480 --> 12:57.560
to pick up signals he wasn't supposed to access

12:57.560 --> 13:00.120
late at night when there wasn't supposed to be anything on the air.

13:00.120 --> 13:04.040
Well, what if the images that you pulled up

13:04.040 --> 13:09.320
were really quite extreme, disturbing, possibly illegal,

13:09.320 --> 13:11.000
and what would you think then?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.880
Would you keep seeking out those channels

13:13.880 --> 13:16.600
or would you call the police or what would you do?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.200
How would you respond to that?

13:18.200 --> 13:21.880
The fear and excitement he felt in anticipation of what he might see,

13:21.880 --> 13:24.600
that fear of what was out there hidden in the static,

13:24.600 --> 13:26.280
inspired him to make Videodrome,

13:26.280 --> 13:28.200
so at least one great horror film

13:28.200 --> 13:31.000
was conceived entirely because of this effect.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.040
Horror and slasher films did really well on tape for this reason,

13:34.040 --> 13:35.960
and many films became long-running series

13:35.960 --> 13:37.480
that probably wouldn't ever have done so

13:37.480 --> 13:39.720
without such successful post-cinema releases

13:39.720 --> 13:42.040
on a format that arguably made them scarier.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.680
Even boring or flat shots in mediocre films

13:44.680 --> 13:46.840
can be made more tense by telling the audience

13:46.840 --> 13:48.760
a killer is out to get the protagonists

13:48.760 --> 13:50.440
and making it just a little bit tougher

13:50.440 --> 13:52.200
to see where they could be hiding.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.720
This also solves another problem.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.560
Those of you who watched my, in retrospect,

13:55.560 --> 13:58.440
woefully unfocused and unresearched video from 2016

13:58.440 --> 14:00.040
about what makes action films work

14:00.040 --> 14:01.240
will remember I made a comment

14:01.240 --> 14:04.600
about how the CGI in Terminator 2 used to look better.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.720
Well, here we are.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.960
Thank you, Shannon, for helping me edit this video

14:07.960 --> 14:09.960
and stop it taking another year.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.120
Computer graphics and animation were largely lacking

14:12.120 --> 14:14.920
in the 80s, 90s, and even the early 2000s.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.600
Nothing really quite looked right,

14:16.600 --> 14:18.440
things didn't feel like they were really there,

14:18.440 --> 14:20.680
texture and displacement mapping wasn't up to snuff,

14:20.680 --> 14:23.640
and you had smooth-looking weird stuff in your frame.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.760
It wasn't great.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.880
But even mediocre CGI can blend right in on tape.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.960
This checkerboard man rising out of the floor

14:29.960 --> 14:33.000
to murder a guy made me scared of my kitchen floor

14:33.000 --> 14:35.560
going to the fridge at night as a hyperactive child.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.880
It was vivid, like in my mind's eye,

14:37.880 --> 14:39.960
Robert Patrick was gonna come out at any moment

14:39.960 --> 14:42.040
and cut my entire body off.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.760
Seeing the now easily available high-definition version

14:44.760 --> 14:46.600
of this scene made me feel like an idiot.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.880
My mind had done most of the work with the bad fidelity.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.960
I think people who saw this scene in a theater

14:51.960 --> 14:54.600
kind of had the scariest bits of the film ruined for them

14:54.600 --> 14:56.200
because in the film prints shown in theaters,

14:56.200 --> 14:57.800
this would have stuck out just as much.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.200
But it wasn't just the relative badness of the image

15:00.200 --> 15:02.040
that popularized certain things over others

15:02.040 --> 15:04.200
in the medium of the video home system.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.280
Another important facet was the fact that,

15:06.280 --> 15:08.360
well, it was in your home.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.000
Like I said before,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.480
Texas Chainsaw Massacre was effectively not allowed

15:15.480 --> 15:17.880
into cinemas when it was first released in the UK.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.480
While some local councils allowed it

15:19.480 --> 15:20.600
to be shown in their theaters,

15:20.600 --> 15:22.840
the viewing experience would have been quite weird.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.920
You'd be openly going out and paying to sit

15:24.920 --> 15:27.240
and see something you knew was banned in other areas

15:27.240 --> 15:28.840
for being violent and horrific.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.440
It was like you were committing a crime

15:30.440 --> 15:33.320
or were openly telling people you wanted to see that stuff

15:33.320 --> 15:35.160
since you'd actively gone and sorted out.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.200
But the uncensored 1981 video release did amazingly,

15:38.200 --> 15:39.640
and it's quite clear why.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.720
Instead of going out and sitting in a public space

15:41.720 --> 15:44.200
for 90 minutes and then awkwardly shuffling out

15:44.200 --> 15:46.040
trying not to make eye contact with the other people

15:46.040 --> 15:48.360
who'd come to see this widely banned film,

15:48.360 --> 15:50.440
you saw it with an audience of your choosing

15:50.440 --> 15:53.240
in the privacy of your own home at a time that suited you.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.480
There was a sense of being free of judgment.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.640
The eyes of the outside world were no longer a factor

15:57.640 --> 15:59.080
in your viewing experience.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.160
This encouraged people to seek out films

16:01.160 --> 16:02.840
they'd never go to see in public,

16:02.840 --> 16:04.920
which, of course, includes pornography.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.920
It's really not hard to see why home video

16:06.920 --> 16:09.880
almost immediately killed porn theaters.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.480
Kevin Smith has happily recounted

16:11.480 --> 16:13.160
his time renting porn to customers,

16:13.160 --> 16:13.560
saying,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.680
and that having a frank conversation

16:18.680 --> 16:19.960
with someone about their sex life

16:19.960 --> 16:21.640
informed his work a great deal.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.440
Home viewing also allowed for a less adult form of privacy,

16:24.440 --> 16:26.840
a kind of comfortable intimacy with friends or family

16:26.840 --> 16:28.520
that you can't get in a theater.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.680
Getting together on the couch with a bowl of popcorn

16:30.680 --> 16:32.920
and the glow of a television to watch a scary movie

16:32.920 --> 16:34.840
is an oft-repeated familial ritual

16:34.840 --> 16:37.160
in much the same way that gathering around a campfire

16:37.160 --> 16:39.240
bathed in orange light to tell ghost stories

16:39.240 --> 16:40.760
has been for generations.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.040
There are also other factors.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.040
You might have noticed that prior to the 90s,

16:44.040 --> 16:46.600
television was shot very straightforwardly and blankly

16:46.600 --> 16:48.040
with actors even in close-ups

16:48.040 --> 16:50.680
framed very differently from films shot at the same time.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.360
This is because televisual language

16:52.360 --> 16:54.840
has to serve a different purpose from film language.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.560
Movies are giant, projected way up and away from you,

16:57.560 --> 17:00.040
staring down at you and occupying your entire view.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.880
You are consumed by a film

17:01.880 --> 17:04.120
and encouraged to think about it and its composition.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.880
You don't do anything else in a cinema

17:05.880 --> 17:06.920
but watch the film.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.520
A television is a smaller screen,

17:08.520 --> 17:09.800
often a good distance from you,

17:09.800 --> 17:11.320
even in a kitchen where other noises

17:11.320 --> 17:12.680
and events are distracting you.

17:12.680 --> 17:13.960
You might even be reading a book

17:13.960 --> 17:16.200
or talking to someone else while the TV is playing.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.120
The early TV production style knew

17:18.120 --> 17:20.520
that you weren't always going to be paying attention,

17:20.520 --> 17:22.120
only pulling you in for the more dramatic

17:22.120 --> 17:23.880
or important moments of a given episode,

17:23.880 --> 17:26.520
usually using something like having music start to play.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.680
The smaller screen also changes the way we relate

17:28.680 --> 17:30.200
to the image and the people in it.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.280
Television can be more human, friendlier.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.400
Those little people on the screen

17:33.400 --> 17:35.160
are having a nice chat about current events

17:35.160 --> 17:37.400
and I feel somewhat included or informed.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.240
A talk show blown up to 70 feet,

17:39.240 --> 17:41.000
staring down at you in a darkened room

17:41.000 --> 17:42.920
with surround sound blasting in your ears

17:42.920 --> 17:45.080
would be overpowering to say the least.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.960
And it turns out the aesthetic and design

17:47.960 --> 17:51.080
of some films are predisposed to mesh beautifully

17:51.080 --> 17:53.000
with the qualities of the television.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.080
Nothing exemplifies this in practice

17:55.080 --> 17:56.760
quite like Mallrats.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.040
Mallrats was Kevin Smith's second film,

18:00.040 --> 18:02.120
produced after the success of his first picture,

18:02.120 --> 18:04.600
the small, self-funded indie hit, Clerks.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.080
When Mallrats came out, no one really got it.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.240
People who loved the low-budget, avant-garde,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.560
doing-it-ourselves, grainy aesthetic of Clerks

18:11.560 --> 18:14.360
hated the well-produced, overly slick feel.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.840
People who cared about editing or cinematography

18:16.840 --> 18:19.640
or good-looking shots got a kind of flat-looking film

18:19.640 --> 18:21.480
with a bunch of boring wide shots

18:21.480 --> 18:24.120
of multiple people just sort of talking about stuff.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.120
Serious critics, into the pointed,

18:26.120 --> 18:28.200
pop-culturally slanted insights of Clerks

18:28.200 --> 18:30.600
and the honest thoughts of astray Gen Xers,

18:30.600 --> 18:32.600
were treated to a bunch of wacky characters

18:32.600 --> 18:33.880
farting about in a mall,

18:33.880 --> 18:35.240
tricking people they didn't like

18:35.240 --> 18:37.480
into making their hands smell like shit.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.920
The film did terribly critically and at the box office.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.520
It looked like Kevin Smith,

18:42.520 --> 18:44.600
the indie darling behind Clerks,

18:44.600 --> 18:46.280
had basically torched his career

18:46.280 --> 18:48.040
with only his second film.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.480
Luckily, a film would then come out

18:49.480 --> 18:52.200
which would miraculously untorch his career.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.320
That film was called Mallrats on Tape.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.600
In 2001, on the subject of criticism of his films,

18:58.600 --> 18:59.400
Smith said,

18:59.400 --> 19:01.320
"'We should be able to make any movie we want,

19:01.320 --> 19:02.280
stupid or not,

19:02.280 --> 19:03.800
so long as it doesn't cost too much

19:03.800 --> 19:04.920
and is reasonably guaranteed

19:04.920 --> 19:06.840
to make its money back for our distributor.'

19:06.840 --> 19:08.120
That, for the curious,

19:08.120 --> 19:10.360
is why we're allowed to keep making movies.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.320
Some cats--"

19:11.320 --> 19:13.160
Oh, I hate how he talks.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.080
Some cats, particularly the denizens

19:15.080 --> 19:16.760
of internet movie chat boards,

19:16.760 --> 19:18.120
can't figure out why we're allowed

19:18.120 --> 19:20.440
to continue lensing flicks

19:20.440 --> 19:23.000
when we never seem to grow as visual storytellers

19:23.000 --> 19:25.560
or keep making, what's to them, the same movie.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.040
The answer is that we've never lost anybody money.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.080
I'll say that again.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.400
We've never lost anybody money.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.240
Granted, we came close with Rats,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.240
but even that made a killing on video

19:35.320 --> 19:37.640
and, more recently, DVD.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.320
Despite box office troubles,

19:39.320 --> 19:41.240
the same film no one went to see

19:41.240 --> 19:42.360
and critics snubbed

19:42.360 --> 19:44.280
was suddenly doing gangbusters,

19:44.280 --> 19:46.680
making it an even more interesting sort of cult hit

19:46.680 --> 19:47.800
than its predecessor,

19:47.800 --> 19:50.120
and it's because of the aesthetic differences

19:50.120 --> 19:51.640
of playing a film on a TV.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.240
All of a sudden, the shot composition

19:53.240 --> 19:54.040
isn't as important

19:54.040 --> 19:55.320
because it's kind of far away from you

19:55.320 --> 19:56.280
and you're doing something else

19:56.280 --> 19:57.400
in the room while it plays

19:57.400 --> 19:58.840
and the low quality of the format

19:58.840 --> 20:00.040
means that even if the shots

20:00.040 --> 20:01.080
were particularly good,

20:01.080 --> 20:02.760
you wouldn't really have noticed anyway.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.280
You aren't having the aimless banter

20:04.280 --> 20:05.560
about nothing blasted at you

20:05.560 --> 20:06.760
from speakers all around you

20:06.760 --> 20:08.520
like it's the most important thing in the world

20:08.520 --> 20:10.440
and you have to listen to every second.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.480
It's playing nearby

20:11.480 --> 20:12.760
and you're just kind of listening in

20:12.760 --> 20:14.600
on these people talking free associatively

20:14.600 --> 20:16.040
about their film opinions.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.200
With this change in the viewing experience,

20:18.200 --> 20:19.080
all of a sudden,

20:19.080 --> 20:20.760
More Rats makes sense.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.200
It becomes a funny little film

20:22.200 --> 20:23.800
where the big scenes and funnier jokes

20:23.800 --> 20:24.600
grab your attention

20:24.600 --> 20:25.640
and the stuff that falls flat

20:25.640 --> 20:26.760
or isn't so well-directed

20:26.760 --> 20:27.640
doesn't matter so much

20:27.640 --> 20:29.080
because it's easier to ignore.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.560
Here's an IMDb review from 2003.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.200
Brad C-2 from Auckland, New Zealand

20:34.200 --> 20:35.800
jokingly says the film is best watched

20:35.800 --> 20:37.000
with your eyes closed.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.080
They criticize the look and feel of the film

20:39.080 --> 20:40.680
and the hamminess of the overall plot

20:40.680 --> 20:41.800
but they loved the dialogue

20:41.800 --> 20:43.880
and they found it sharp and effervescent

20:43.880 --> 20:45.560
and they say it's their favorite film

20:45.560 --> 20:46.520
of Kevin Smith's.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.560
I would say so far,

20:47.560 --> 20:48.200
but honestly,

20:48.200 --> 20:50.200
considering the films he made after 2003,

20:50.200 --> 20:52.360
More Rats is probably still their favorite.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.040
Kevin Smith films screened in a theater

20:54.040 --> 20:54.680
on a big screen

20:54.680 --> 20:56.120
are arguably missing the point.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.320
The joy of these films

20:57.320 --> 20:58.920
is in crowding around a small TV

20:58.920 --> 20:59.720
at your friend's house

20:59.720 --> 21:00.920
and watching little people on it

21:00.920 --> 21:02.680
with no pretensions of grandiosity

21:02.680 --> 21:03.880
being shitty to customers

21:03.880 --> 21:05.400
and talking about their lives.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.080
If you've sat down and watched More Rats

21:07.080 --> 21:08.440
screened in a high resolution

21:08.440 --> 21:10.040
and a cool retro revival screening

21:10.040 --> 21:11.320
at your local college,

21:11.320 --> 21:13.880
unsubscribe from my channel immediately, Kurt.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.000
We talked about this.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.520
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.600
Imagine all the films from across history

21:18.600 --> 21:20.360
that were doomed to be misunderstood

21:20.360 --> 21:21.720
by the theater-going audience

21:21.720 --> 21:22.680
whose real destiny

21:22.680 --> 21:24.040
was to be truly appreciated

21:24.040 --> 21:25.160
on the small screen

21:25.160 --> 21:26.360
where the viewer's relationship

21:26.360 --> 21:28.120
with the work was completely different.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.200
VHS was the first second chance

21:30.200 --> 21:31.080
for those films,

21:31.080 --> 21:32.600
and it created an appreciation

21:32.600 --> 21:34.040
for these kinds of story

21:34.040 --> 21:36.360
for televisual filmmaking.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.120
You can see this trend happening in reverse

21:38.120 --> 21:39.320
as televisions get bigger

21:39.320 --> 21:40.680
and their picture becomes clearer

21:40.680 --> 21:42.520
and their aspect ratio more film-like.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.360
TV shows with a cinematic approach

21:44.360 --> 21:45.560
like Breaking Bad,

21:45.560 --> 21:46.040
Mad Men,

21:46.040 --> 21:46.760
The Sopranos,

21:46.760 --> 21:47.320
or Hannibal

21:47.320 --> 21:49.240
are becoming more prominent and popular.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.480
HBO calls itself home box office

21:51.480 --> 21:53.000
because the home viewing experience

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
is finally akin enough to a theater

21:55.000 --> 21:56.200
that these aesthetic changes

21:56.200 --> 21:57.640
can really be appreciated.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.920
People didn't just not care

21:58.920 --> 21:59.960
about having television

21:59.960 --> 22:01.960
that wasn't very nice-looking for 60 years.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.720
Our relationship with the screen

22:03.720 --> 22:05.160
simply changed in accordance

22:05.160 --> 22:06.360
with its change in format

22:06.360 --> 22:08.120
and size in our living rooms.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.600
In the age of HD and TV on demand,

22:10.600 --> 22:12.440
soap operas are waning in popularity

22:12.440 --> 22:13.640
as the increased fidelity

22:13.640 --> 22:15.480
and the typical viewer's filmic awareness

22:15.480 --> 22:17.240
expose the show's production failings

22:17.240 --> 22:18.440
and straightforwardness

22:18.440 --> 22:20.120
more than the older ways could,

22:20.120 --> 22:21.480
and the idea that you could be watching

22:21.480 --> 22:22.920
Game of Thrones or House of Cards

22:22.920 --> 22:24.200
at any time

22:24.200 --> 22:25.480
suddenly makes neighbors

22:25.480 --> 22:26.760
a bit less of a thing

22:26.760 --> 22:28.120
that you might want to watch,

22:28.120 --> 22:29.240
although people still watch it

22:29.240 --> 22:29.960
all the time over here

22:29.960 --> 22:31.160
and it's a little bit scary.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.200
They make it in Australia,

22:32.200 --> 22:33.160
but they make it for us

22:33.160 --> 22:34.680
because we're the only people who watch it.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.160
Why are weâ€”

22:35.160 --> 22:36.120
I'm a little bit worried

22:36.120 --> 22:37.640
this might once again make it harder

22:37.640 --> 22:39.160
for some films to be appreciated

22:39.160 --> 22:40.120
because you even watch them

22:40.120 --> 22:41.320
like a film at home,

22:41.320 --> 22:42.520
but it's not like we're gonna just

22:42.520 --> 22:44.280
stop making television shows,

22:44.280 --> 22:46.200
so we're probably fine for now.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.080
People will always want higher fidelity versions

22:53.080 --> 22:54.200
of their favorite films.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.640
Some people want a high-res version

22:55.640 --> 22:57.160
of the original cuts of Star Wars

22:57.160 --> 22:58.920
so badly that they've resorted

22:58.920 --> 23:00.520
to making that version themselves

23:00.520 --> 23:01.720
with different restorations

23:01.720 --> 23:03.720
pulling from 35mm prints,

23:03.720 --> 23:05.160
70mm prints,

23:05.160 --> 23:06.360
a TV broadcast,

23:06.360 --> 23:07.560
DVD special features,

23:07.560 --> 23:08.920
and more all in the service

23:08.920 --> 23:10.040
of recreating the films

23:10.040 --> 23:11.800
they remember from way back when.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.320
You can also see this battle happening

23:13.320 --> 23:14.680
on the filmmaking end.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.280
A filmmaker will always find

23:16.280 --> 23:18.360
newer and better cameras on the market,

23:18.360 --> 23:19.320
more bit depth,

23:19.320 --> 23:20.440
better codecs,

23:20.440 --> 23:23.480
1080p, 4K, 6K, 8K sensors,

23:23.480 --> 23:25.080
all for footage that will often end up

23:25.080 --> 23:26.680
getting seen on YouTube

23:26.680 --> 23:27.720
at whatever resolution

23:27.720 --> 23:29.240
their audience's computer monitors

23:29.240 --> 23:30.840
or phone screens happen to be

23:30.840 --> 23:32.440
with YouTube's compression algorithm

23:32.440 --> 23:33.960
eradicating most of the specs

23:33.960 --> 23:35.000
of their footage.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.840
Looking good doesn't necessarily mean

23:36.840 --> 23:38.280
having the best definition.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.800
Telling a good story is the goal,

23:39.800 --> 23:41.000
and if you get that wrong,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.840
not even doing it on an Arri Alexa

23:42.840 --> 23:43.640
can save you.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.160
Obviously, shoot on the best equipment

23:45.160 --> 23:46.120
you can get your hands on

23:46.120 --> 23:47.720
and aim for a form of distribution

23:47.720 --> 23:49.160
that best suits your work,

23:49.160 --> 23:50.440
but I think the real challenge

23:50.440 --> 23:51.480
is to make something that people

23:51.480 --> 23:52.520
would fall in love with

23:52.520 --> 23:53.800
even if they were watching it

23:53.800 --> 23:56.120
on a crappy old tape in the 90s,

23:56.120 --> 23:57.000
and in its own way,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.120
whether we like it or not,

23:58.120 --> 23:59.800
those tapes and the impact they had

23:59.800 --> 24:00.840
will never leave us.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.360
The format is in our history now,

24:02.360 --> 24:03.560
and we remember it.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.840
Nostalgia is real,

24:04.840 --> 24:06.680
and it affects how we view old films

24:06.680 --> 24:07.800
or perceive new films

24:07.800 --> 24:09.480
that use it as a purposeful style.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.760
Many films made in the vein

24:10.760 --> 24:12.120
of 80s or 90s horror

24:12.120 --> 24:14.200
get limited little VHS releases

24:14.200 --> 24:15.080
because that's the style

24:15.080 --> 24:16.520
they were courting in the first place.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.120
Then there are the immensely popular

24:18.120 --> 24:20.280
retro camcorder phone apps you can get

24:20.280 --> 24:22.040
and the web skits that use the aesthetic

24:22.040 --> 24:23.480
as part of a deeper throwback

24:23.480 --> 24:25.960
to kitschy 90s children's programming.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.560
Many new films exist only

24:27.560 --> 24:28.520
in the form of tapes

24:28.520 --> 24:29.800
or what are designed to look like

24:29.800 --> 24:31.000
low-res rips of tapes

24:31.000 --> 24:32.600
like the truly fascinating,

24:32.600 --> 24:35.320
funny, and smart WNUF Halloween special

24:35.320 --> 24:36.760
in order to channel the style

24:36.760 --> 24:38.120
and further create a sense

24:38.120 --> 24:39.480
of seeing a documented record

24:39.480 --> 24:40.440
of a time period.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.960
One film that combines all of this

24:41.960 --> 24:43.320
with tapes' ability to make

24:43.320 --> 24:44.680
cheap special effects look better

24:44.680 --> 24:46.600
is the found footage film VHS,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.360
an anthology of a bunch of short films

24:48.360 --> 24:50.120
from various diegetic videotapes,

24:50.120 --> 24:51.720
and its relative low-budget effects

24:51.720 --> 24:53.640
are done real justice by the aesthetic.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.960
The final segment, 10-31-98,

24:55.960 --> 24:58.360
has a truly fascinating climactic sequence

24:58.360 --> 25:00.440
where everything goes completely crazy nuts

25:00.440 --> 25:02.040
and it's the most frighteningly real

25:02.040 --> 25:03.640
a horror segment with what are actually

25:03.640 --> 25:06.120
fairly rudimentary effects has ever felt

25:06.120 --> 25:07.960
because the poor quality of the footage

25:07.960 --> 25:09.640
makes it so much more believable.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.000
If you filmed a window

25:11.000 --> 25:13.240
actually sliding out of existence

25:13.240 --> 25:15.240
and hands coming out of the walls

25:15.240 --> 25:17.080
on a camera from this time period,

25:17.080 --> 25:18.680
it would literally look exactly

25:18.680 --> 25:20.040
the same as this footage,

25:20.040 --> 25:21.960
and knowing that makes this sequence

25:21.960 --> 25:24.760
infinitely punchier and more real-feeling

25:24.760 --> 25:25.880
than the same effect would

25:25.880 --> 25:27.240
in any modern horror film.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.240
Growing up, I think the first favorite film

25:35.240 --> 25:37.560
I ever had was Terry Gilliam's

25:37.560 --> 25:38.840
Time Bandits.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.080
I think it was the first film I ever saw

25:41.080 --> 25:42.200
where seeing it I felt like

25:42.200 --> 25:43.240
it was made for me.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.880
It took my sense of alienation

25:45.880 --> 25:48.040
from adult life and channeled it

25:48.040 --> 25:49.240
into telling a story about

25:49.240 --> 25:50.840
a vividly imaginative world

25:50.840 --> 25:52.520
where the outsiders were the ones

25:52.520 --> 25:53.640
who were truly free,

25:53.640 --> 25:55.160
escaping from their parents,

25:55.160 --> 25:57.400
invading armies, and even the will of God

25:57.400 --> 25:59.640
in getting what they wanted out of life.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.640
It made me feel good to not be

26:01.640 --> 26:02.760
like everyone else,

26:02.760 --> 26:03.880
like I was getting won over

26:03.880 --> 26:05.240
on the world somehow.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.080
This film helped make me who I am

26:07.080 --> 26:08.840
and shape how I see everything,

26:08.840 --> 26:11.560
and it did it on my dad's tiny television

26:11.560 --> 26:13.560
in letterbox widescreen.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.160
Obviously, for the sake of preservation

26:15.160 --> 26:16.200
and film history,

26:16.200 --> 26:17.560
a high-res official version

26:17.560 --> 26:19.000
of handshooting first would be nice

26:19.080 --> 26:19.720
to have.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.560
We can chase higher and higher resolutions

26:21.560 --> 26:22.360
as much as we want,

26:22.360 --> 26:23.000
and we should.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.200
I think they look great.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.360
But the funny and kind of amazing thing is

26:26.920 --> 26:28.680
millions of people only needed

26:28.680 --> 26:31.000
a fifth of those lines of resolution

26:31.000 --> 26:32.520
on a tiny screen

26:32.520 --> 26:34.200
to fall in love with these films

26:34.200 --> 26:36.520
and have them shape how they see the world.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.440
For me, Time Bandits is

26:38.440 --> 26:39.960
the objectively crappy version

26:39.960 --> 26:41.480
I saw as a kid over and over

26:41.480 --> 26:43.400
on a tiny widescreen tape

26:43.400 --> 26:45.400
in the night when no one else was around,

26:45.400 --> 26:47.480
feeling inspired by the sense of adventure

26:47.480 --> 26:48.600
and briefly pausing

26:48.600 --> 26:50.280
to go to the kitchen for a snack

26:50.280 --> 26:52.040
and get scared by the floor.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.560
All the Ks in the world

26:53.560 --> 26:54.920
won't replicate the experience

26:54.920 --> 26:56.040
I had as a kid.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.160
It might even ruin it

26:57.160 --> 26:58.920
by revealing all the obvious models

26:58.920 --> 26:59.800
and matte paintings

26:59.800 --> 27:01.240
and all the wood screws on the sets

27:01.240 --> 27:02.520
for what they really were.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.400
VHS was always a kind of bad format.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.040
But in spite and because

27:08.040 --> 27:09.720
of all its problems,

27:09.720 --> 27:12.360
it caused a dramatic shift in pop culture

27:12.360 --> 27:14.520
and in the taste and approaches to cinema

27:14.520 --> 27:15.720
by viewing audiences

27:15.720 --> 27:18.040
which is still felt to this very day

27:18.040 --> 27:19.720
in the form of the cinema literacy

27:19.720 --> 27:21.320
and particular feel and taste

27:21.320 --> 27:23.160
it cultivated even by accident

27:23.160 --> 27:23.960
with its style.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
Oh no, look what happened by accident.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.760
Oh no, look what happened by accident.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.760
Oh no, look what happened by accident.
