0	7200	You know, it's been pretty great over the last couple of years developing something of an audience, you know, a following and YouTube subscribers and
7720	12320	fans and people on Twitter who want to know what I have to say about stuff.
12720	16560	But to be honest, it's getting kind of annoying. I'm kind of sick of having them.
17160	21240	So I thought the best way to get rid of them would be to start a new YouTube video series
21540	27040	exploring the theory and philosophy and politics of various aspects of film that I feel aren't explored enough.
27200	31360	That should do the trick and along the way I might remind people of some of my more
31840	37400	contrarian opinions like the fact I think the Star Wars prequels are actually pretty good. Stuff like that. I just did it then, didn't I?
38440	40680	Welcome to Scanline.
57040	69960	If you're older than the age of 20 or have parents that don't throw things out,
70280	74160	then you probably have at least a couple of these things in an attic or a shed somewhere.
74720	80860	These are video home system cassette tapes, commonly known as VHS tapes. They entered use in the late
81320	86200	1970s and were a very popular way of watching films and TV shows in your own home anytime you wanted,
86200	89280	which for the time was a really novel and new concept.
89280	92360	With SelectaVision, you can go to the movies at your house!
92360	96160	I know this because I looked it up on the Wikipedia page when I was writing this script.
96160	98760	But let's get into what the world's largest ence,
99280	102440	Lie-clopedia, doesn't want you to know.
107760	113120	If you weren't in front of the TV when a show aired or hadn't gone to the cinema when a film was out, your primary
113280	118360	interaction with most pieces of modern entertainment and culture would have been through the medium of VHS.
118640	125360	Almost every piece of audio-visual art you consumed, no matter what it was made with, shot on, or how advanced the budget and special effects,
125360	129680	you saw it via the signal produced from the magnetic reels in these plastic boxes.
129680	133440	If you fell in love with a story, it was probably thanks to these tapes.
133760	136680	It's a pity, then, that they look like shit.
137160	141760	A standard PAL VHS recording consisted of roughly 320 horizontal lines and
142400	144400	576 vertical lines of visual information.
144720	148680	Worse, you wouldn't actually be getting your films at that resolution.
148680	151680	Since most films were produced in wide or super wide screen,
151680	155040	but VHS was for the 4x3 resolution of contemporary televisions,
155040	157160	you had a problem even showing a film.
157160	161520	You could crop out the sides of a film and move the screen around, what's called pan and scan,
161520	166200	which could totally ruin the story of films where multiple things were happening on different sides of the frame,
166200	169440	or you could scale the whole thing down and add black bars to the top and bottom,
169680	172160	creating what was called the letterbox effect.
172160	176200	On the pan and scan version of A New Hope, the opening text crawl doesn't fit the screen,
176200	179240	so you have to wait until it gets here before you can even possibly read it.
179240	183880	In the widescreen version, you can see the entire line of text as soon as it enters the frame,
183880	186480	but it's scaled down, so it's just as hard to read.
186480	190640	I always really liked the scene from Aliens where Burke is trying to be friendly with Ripley in hospital,
190640	195160	so he brings Jonesy in and sits backwards in his chair and spins playfully in it while the camera pulls in
195160	199200	and gets more intimate, so he can then tell her that she's been frozen for 57 years.
199200	202360	There's lots of good moments of subtle acting and characterization,
202360	207440	and I like the cinematography of this cool sci-fi room, and there's a cute cat in the frame, too.
207440	212520	The pan and scan version of this scene just barely manages to get both characters in the frame at once.
212520	217800	It completely removes a lot of Burke's body language as he tries to be nice while preparing to break the news to her,
217800	219800	and poor Jonesy's head is cut off.
219800	221920	Jonesy isn't in this film after the beginning.
221920	224800	Does Jonesy over here look happy with pan and scan?
224800	226840	I don't think he does, but I can't actually tell.
226880	229920	Even worse, because of the vile machinations of capitalism,
229920	232880	the first preferred solution by movie studios was pan and scan,
232880	234800	so they sold all the films like that,
234800	239120	and then, once they figured out that directors hated having their films recut to fit the new frame
239120	243320	and widescreen was basically objectively superior because it displayed the entire film,
243320	248720	they got to sell you the films all over again with the promise that this time it was better.
248720	251520	Now, for the first time on video,
251520	256640	you can savor the true experience of these blockbusters in their original format.
256640	258200	Widescreen.
258200	260440	My copy of the Aliens special editionâ€”
260440	262920	sorry, the Aliens special edition?
262920	265360	Apparently I bought this tape from a xenomorph?
265360	269560	Opens with a commercial for the widescreen versions of Alien and Die Hard.
269560	270840	Fuckers.
270840	274520	And guess what? This version of Aliens is in pan and scan!
274520	276880	This is already the special edition of Aliens,
276880	281760	and now you're telling me I'm gonna have to buy it again when the widescreen special edition comes out?
281800	287600	20th Century Fox? More like 22nd Century Weyland-Yutani?
287600	288800	I'm sorry.
288800	290080	And that was it.
290080	292440	That was how people watched films.
292440	296080	They picked their poison between a tiny version of the original film
296080	302680	or a recut, reframed, gutted, despicable, cat-erasing version of the original,
302680	306280	and whichever one you picked, you got it in this flickery format.
306280	309720	You got this facsimile of the film that you wanted to see.
309720	312160	And that was how we consumed media.
313400	315280	For decades.
315280	321240	Some versions of the above-average fantasy film series Star Wars only ever widely existed on this format.
321240	325280	Many fans of Star Wars all over message boards and forums and my mentions
325280	328880	fell in love with the films because of tapes they rented or bought.
328880	329960	Because of this.
329960	331280	But wait a minute.
331280	334200	We can talk about specs and make fun of the video quality all day.
334200	337560	People still watched them, people still used them to record shows off the TV,
337560	340400	and people still shared and circulated those recordings.
340400	343560	Thanks to people wanting to see things and needing tape to do so,
343560	348880	homemade tapes are still the only way to find copies of shows that weren't available in any official format.
348880	353680	Many episodes of Mystery Science Theater didn't get a proper release for years after their initial air date,
353680	355080	and many still don't.
355080	358560	Prior to high-speed internet, the only way of accessing these old episodes
358560	362520	was through home recordings people happened to have made at the time the show aired.
362520	365640	You'd be amazed at what hoops folks would jump through to see a show they liked,
365680	367800	even on a low-res home tape recording.
367800	372400	And what if you were a fan of anime in the era prior to major home video releases of foreign animation?
372400	377040	Why, you would have to hope you knew a store with crazy import stuff with really poor fan translations
377040	382320	or hope someone had taped the shows that did make it over at the crazy times they turned up.
382320	384400	In retrospect, the format wasn't great,
384400	387520	but it was certainly good enough for audiences who wanted to watch something
387520	389880	in the comfort of their own homes whenever they wanted to,
389880	393520	and it was basically the first format that allowed people to do this.
393520	397840	It led to widespread consumption of material that would otherwise be forgotten or go unseen.
397840	400320	In the 70s and 80s, for the first time ever,
400320	404040	a regular person could have an archive of shows or films they enjoyed
404040	407400	without having to get a projector and go in search of film reels on eBay,
407400	412160	which would be really hard to do, considering that eBay didn't exist until 1995.
412160	415280	A person could learn about and consume elements of their culture
415280	419000	and develop an understanding of film so much more easily than the decades prior.
419000	423800	In fact, Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith worked in local video stores before becoming directors,
423800	427240	giving them an opportunity to further incubate their own passion for film
427240	429000	as well as share it directly with others
429000	433960	before going on to make some of the most influential films, for better or worse, of the 1990s.
433960	438000	The advent of VHS ushered in a new era of accessibility for film fans.
438000	442240	Tastes in film and appetites for film could be developed much more rapidly than ever before.
442240	446120	It marked the beginning in a radical and permanent shift in media consumption.
446120	449240	You were no longer reliant on what was playing in your local multiplex
449240	452760	or what old French films the weird art schools were projecting that month,
452760	455480	and you no longer had to adhere rigidly to TV schedules
455480	458960	or catch films or TV shows deigned worthy of being shown.
458960	461760	The shift was so radical that film companies panicked.
461760	465440	Then-MPAA head Jack Valenti, in an act of comical hyperbole,
465440	469160	said in a congressional hearing that the VCR is to the American film producer
469160	473400	and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone.
473400	477160	Universal Studios even sued Sony on the grounds of copyright infringement
477160	479640	over their Betamax video recording format.
479640	482880	Luckily, it was ruled that home recording devices operate under fair use,
482880	488240	and of course, once film companies realized how profitable home video could be, they backed off.
488240	491200	Many films started being made with their sales on the burgeoning
491200	494560	and seemingly never-endingly hungry VHS market in mind,
494560	497480	or even without the intent of ever being screened in a theater.
497480	499200	Some were barely even films.
499200	502960	They were instructional videos or Christmas-themed cat nightmares
502960	507160	or musical propaganda for a Christian cult that lived in the woods.
507160	511560	Lots of popular films did well on tape, but still others did hugely well on tape,
511560	515400	more so than you could expect from their cinematic release or critical reception.
515400	517200	The question here is why.
517200	523200	What is it about being available on VHS that made people suddenly become connoisseurs of horror or independent film?
523200	525080	Well, those reasons tend to get overlooked.
525080	526360	Let's look at some of them right now.
526360	528640	[â™ª Music begins to fade out â™ª
529600	533920	When making the film Jaws, which would come to be regarded as the first ever summer blockbuster,
533920	536760	Spielberg and co. discovered some problems with the shark prop,
536760	541600	a prop many would regard as quite important in a film about a shark that eats people.
541600	544600	The animatronics kept breaking down, bits kept falling off of it,
544600	547400	and most importantly, it kept sinking.
547400	550880	The fake shark had trouble floating in water.
550880	554840	Spielberg instead had to rely on using shots of almost everything but the shark
554840	556920	to demonstrate the horror of its presence,
556920	561280	show the aftermath, show explosions of blood in the distance, show the actor's reactions.
561280	565240	The result was a film where you barely ever get to see the animatronic shark,
565240	567280	but its presence is felt regardless.
567280	571160	The shark is rendered even scarier by not being shown in all its glory,
571160	573880	and its glory wasn't really all that much to see anyway.
573880	576520	It was a broken mechanical shark.
576520	581600	Toby Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an incredibly startling and foundational film in the horror genre.
581600	585320	When James Fuhrman, a British censor and secretary of the BBFC at the time,
585320	589800	tried to cut the film to reduce its violent and nightmarishly oppressive atmosphere,
589800	593640	he found, to his own personal shock, that he couldn't.
593640	596680	There isn't all that much actual violence or blood in the film.
596680	600760	There are no single pieces or shots you could remove to diminish its effects.
600760	604600	Instead, it's a cumulative effect of all the properties of the entire film
604600	609080	in setting a tone and creating a mood without needing to show you anything in particular.
609080	613080	In the end, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was refused a certification by the BBFC,
613080	615560	effectively banning it in the United Kingdom.
615560	618760	What these stories tell us is that even in visual mediums,
618760	620920	supposedly all about showing people things,
620920	623960	for achieving some effects, often less is more.
623960	626840	The human mind is incredibly good at scaring itself,
626840	630520	and sometimes not being shown what you're supposed to be scared of is the worst thing.
630520	635400	Confusion settles in, fear of what could be there, what could happen fills your head,
635400	637960	and your imagination, with its own particular fears,
637960	640520	gets to substitute those over whatever's actually there.
640520	644680	Texas Chainsaw Massacre did fantastically well when it was released in 1981,
644680	647400	allowing many Brits access to the film for the first time,
647400	649080	but many horror films did well on tape,
649080	651880	even if they relied much more on gore or were poorly cut,
651880	655240	and this is because of a particular form of this principle.
655240	656920	Let's think about VHS again.
656920	659720	That awful, tiny resolution, flickery screen,
659720	662040	even pure blackness is off-kilter.
662040	664360	If you walked into a room with this playing,
664360	669160	you might even think you're watching a scene of something hiding in darkness.
669160	672680	I bet you can almost make out a figure hidden there in all the noise.
672680	674440	You see where I'm going with this now, don't you?
675080	680360	Here's Alien, one of the best, most emotionally intense and scary films ever on VHS,
680360	684120	and through these tapes, Alien was flipping terrifying.
684120	688440	I remember being out of my mind scared by this low-res monstrosity,
688440	690760	and it wasn't just because of the great acting,
690760	693240	directing, editing, creature design, or music.
693240	696280	It was because in all the tensest and darkest moments,
696280	699320	you could never really quite be sure what you were looking at.
699320	702520	Abstract shapes in the background could almost look like something else.
702520	704280	The flickers and noise in the darkness
704280	706760	were easily confused for glimpses of the monster.
706760	709000	Even when you were sure nothing was there,
709000	710760	you could never really be sure.
710760	714040	When the monster actually turned up, it was almost a relief.
714040	716840	Like, at least now, you knew where the creature actually was.
716840	718600	-â™ª You never let it go â™ª
718760	720760	-â™ª You never let it go â™ª
720760	721800	Dallas?
721800	724520	In other words, a lower-resolution format
724520	727320	can increase the emotional impact of a scene.
727320	731160	Horror and suspense have the chance to strike people like it never had before.
731160	733400	No wonder films like this did well.
733400	736280	In some ways, modern high-resolution versions of these films
736280	738840	can't quite capture that particular magic.
738840	740760	Here's a scene from the Blu-ray version.
740760	743160	It looks great, but it's not as scary
743160	746360	because you can quite definitely see that nothing's there.
746360	749880	You know the character is alone in ways that you couldn't be certain of before.
749880	752280	Really good films actually put this principle into practice
752280	753720	within the medium itself.
753720	756520	For example, Alien and Aliens both have sequences
756520	759240	that prominently feature the use of cameras and video feeds
759240	760680	with a very poor signal.
760680	762920	Even if the higher-resolution version of the film
762920	764840	does diminish some of the horror elements,
764840	768040	these segments still hold up exactly like they always did
768040	770600	because the effects of viewing low-resolution video
770600	772600	are worked into the aesthetic of the film.
772600	775480	As a kid, David Cronenberg rotated his TV antenna
775480	777560	to pick up signals he wasn't supposed to access
777560	780120	late at night when there wasn't supposed to be anything on the air.
780120	784040	Well, what if the images that you pulled up
784040	789320	were really quite extreme, disturbing, possibly illegal,
789320	791000	and what would you think then?
791000	793880	Would you keep seeking out those channels
793880	796600	or would you call the police or what would you do?
796600	798200	How would you respond to that?
798200	801880	The fear and excitement he felt in anticipation of what he might see,
801880	804600	that fear of what was out there hidden in the static,
804600	806280	inspired him to make Videodrome,
806280	808200	so at least one great horror film
808200	811000	was conceived entirely because of this effect.
811000	814040	Horror and slasher films did really well on tape for this reason,
814040	815960	and many films became long-running series
815960	817480	that probably wouldn't ever have done so
817480	819720	without such successful post-cinema releases
819720	822040	on a format that arguably made them scarier.
822040	824680	Even boring or flat shots in mediocre films
824680	826840	can be made more tense by telling the audience
826840	828760	a killer is out to get the protagonists
828760	830440	and making it just a little bit tougher
830440	832200	to see where they could be hiding.
832200	833720	This also solves another problem.
833720	835560	Those of you who watched my, in retrospect,
835560	838440	woefully unfocused and unresearched video from 2016
838440	840040	about what makes action films work
840040	841240	will remember I made a comment
841240	844600	about how the CGI in Terminator 2 used to look better.
844600	845720	Well, here we are.
845720	847960	Thank you, Shannon, for helping me edit this video
847960	849960	and stop it taking another year.
849960	852120	Computer graphics and animation were largely lacking
852120	854920	in the 80s, 90s, and even the early 2000s.
854920	856600	Nothing really quite looked right,
856600	858440	things didn't feel like they were really there,
858440	860680	texture and displacement mapping wasn't up to snuff,
860680	863640	and you had smooth-looking weird stuff in your frame.
863640	864760	It wasn't great.
864760	867880	But even mediocre CGI can blend right in on tape.
867880	869960	This checkerboard man rising out of the floor
869960	873000	to murder a guy made me scared of my kitchen floor
873000	875560	going to the fridge at night as a hyperactive child.
875560	877880	It was vivid, like in my mind's eye,
877880	879960	Robert Patrick was gonna come out at any moment
879960	882040	and cut my entire body off.
882040	884760	Seeing the now easily available high-definition version
884760	886600	of this scene made me feel like an idiot.
886600	889880	My mind had done most of the work with the bad fidelity.
889880	891960	I think people who saw this scene in a theater
891960	894600	kind of had the scariest bits of the film ruined for them
894600	896200	because in the film prints shown in theaters,
896200	897800	this would have stuck out just as much.
897800	900200	But it wasn't just the relative badness of the image
900200	902040	that popularized certain things over others
902040	904200	in the medium of the video home system.
904200	906280	Another important facet was the fact that,
906280	908360	well, it was in your home.
912120	913000	Like I said before,
913000	915480	Texas Chainsaw Massacre was effectively not allowed
915480	917880	into cinemas when it was first released in the UK.
917960	919480	While some local councils allowed it
919480	920600	to be shown in their theaters,
920600	922840	the viewing experience would have been quite weird.
922840	924920	You'd be openly going out and paying to sit
924920	927240	and see something you knew was banned in other areas
927240	928840	for being violent and horrific.
928840	930440	It was like you were committing a crime
930440	933320	or were openly telling people you wanted to see that stuff
933320	935160	since you'd actively gone and sorted out.
935160	938200	But the uncensored 1981 video release did amazingly,
938200	939640	and it's quite clear why.
939640	941720	Instead of going out and sitting in a public space
941720	944200	for 90 minutes and then awkwardly shuffling out
944200	946040	trying not to make eye contact with the other people
946040	948360	who'd come to see this widely banned film,
948360	950440	you saw it with an audience of your choosing
950440	953240	in the privacy of your own home at a time that suited you.
953240	955480	There was a sense of being free of judgment.
955480	957640	The eyes of the outside world were no longer a factor
957640	959080	in your viewing experience.
959080	961160	This encouraged people to seek out films
961160	962840	they'd never go to see in public,
962840	964920	which, of course, includes pornography.
964920	966920	It's really not hard to see why home video
966920	969880	almost immediately killed porn theaters.
969880	971480	Kevin Smith has happily recounted
971480	973160	his time renting porn to customers,
973160	973560	saying,
977000	978680	and that having a frank conversation
978680	979960	with someone about their sex life
979960	981640	informed his work a great deal.
981640	984440	Home viewing also allowed for a less adult form of privacy,
984440	986840	a kind of comfortable intimacy with friends or family
986840	988520	that you can't get in a theater.
988520	990680	Getting together on the couch with a bowl of popcorn
990680	992920	and the glow of a television to watch a scary movie
992920	994840	is an oft-repeated familial ritual
994840	997160	in much the same way that gathering around a campfire
997160	999240	bathed in orange light to tell ghost stories
999240	1000760	has been for generations.
1000760	1002040	There are also other factors.
1002040	1004040	You might have noticed that prior to the 90s,
1004040	1006600	television was shot very straightforwardly and blankly
1006600	1008040	with actors even in close-ups
1008040	1010680	framed very differently from films shot at the same time.
1010680	1012360	This is because televisual language
1012360	1014840	has to serve a different purpose from film language.
1014840	1017560	Movies are giant, projected way up and away from you,
1017560	1020040	staring down at you and occupying your entire view.
1020040	1021880	You are consumed by a film
1021880	1024120	and encouraged to think about it and its composition.
1024120	1025880	You don't do anything else in a cinema
1025880	1026920	but watch the film.
1026920	1028520	A television is a smaller screen,
1028520	1029800	often a good distance from you,
1029800	1031320	even in a kitchen where other noises
1031320	1032680	and events are distracting you.
1032680	1033960	You might even be reading a book
1033960	1036200	or talking to someone else while the TV is playing.
1036200	1038120	The early TV production style knew
1038120	1040520	that you weren't always going to be paying attention,
1040520	1042120	only pulling you in for the more dramatic
1042120	1043880	or important moments of a given episode,
1043880	1046520	usually using something like having music start to play.
1046520	1048680	The smaller screen also changes the way we relate
1048680	1050200	to the image and the people in it.
1050200	1052280	Television can be more human, friendlier.
1052280	1053400	Those little people on the screen
1053400	1055160	are having a nice chat about current events
1055160	1057400	and I feel somewhat included or informed.
1057400	1059240	A talk show blown up to 70 feet,
1059240	1061000	staring down at you in a darkened room
1061000	1062920	with surround sound blasting in your ears
1062920	1065080	would be overpowering to say the least.
1065080	1067960	And it turns out the aesthetic and design
1067960	1071080	of some films are predisposed to mesh beautifully
1071080	1073000	with the qualities of the television.
1073000	1075080	Nothing exemplifies this in practice
1075080	1076760	quite like Mallrats.
1078120	1080040	Mallrats was Kevin Smith's second film,
1080040	1082120	produced after the success of his first picture,
1082120	1084600	the small, self-funded indie hit, Clerks.
1084600	1087080	When Mallrats came out, no one really got it.
1087080	1089240	People who loved the low-budget, avant-garde,
1089240	1091560	doing-it-ourselves, grainy aesthetic of Clerks
1091560	1094360	hated the well-produced, overly slick feel.
1094360	1096840	People who cared about editing or cinematography
1096840	1099640	or good-looking shots got a kind of flat-looking film
1099640	1101480	with a bunch of boring wide shots
1101480	1104120	of multiple people just sort of talking about stuff.
1104120	1106120	Serious critics, into the pointed,
1106120	1108200	pop-culturally slanted insights of Clerks
1108200	1110600	and the honest thoughts of astray Gen Xers,
1110600	1112600	were treated to a bunch of wacky characters
1112600	1113880	farting about in a mall,
1113880	1115240	tricking people they didn't like
1115240	1117480	into making their hands smell like shit.
1117480	1120920	The film did terribly critically and at the box office.
1120920	1122520	It looked like Kevin Smith,
1122520	1124600	the indie darling behind Clerks,
1124600	1126280	had basically torched his career
1126280	1128040	with only his second film.
1128040	1129480	Luckily, a film would then come out
1129480	1132200	which would miraculously untorch his career.
1132200	1135320	That film was called Mallrats on Tape.
1135320	1138600	In 2001, on the subject of criticism of his films,
1138600	1139400	Smith said,
1139400	1141320	"'We should be able to make any movie we want,
1141320	1142280	stupid or not,
1142280	1143800	so long as it doesn't cost too much
1143800	1144920	and is reasonably guaranteed
1144920	1146840	to make its money back for our distributor.'
1146840	1148120	That, for the curious,
1148120	1150360	is why we're allowed to keep making movies.
1150360	1151320	Some cats--"
1151320	1153160	Oh, I hate how he talks.
1153160	1155080	Some cats, particularly the denizens
1155080	1156760	of internet movie chat boards,
1156760	1158120	can't figure out why we're allowed
1158120	1160440	to continue lensing flicks
1160440	1163000	when we never seem to grow as visual storytellers
1163000	1165560	or keep making, what's to them, the same movie.
1165560	1168040	The answer is that we've never lost anybody money.
1168040	1169080	I'll say that again.
1169080	1171400	We've never lost anybody money.
1171400	1173240	Granted, we came close with Rats,
1173240	1175240	but even that made a killing on video
1175320	1177640	and, more recently, DVD.
1177640	1179320	Despite box office troubles,
1179320	1181240	the same film no one went to see
1181240	1182360	and critics snubbed
1182360	1184280	was suddenly doing gangbusters,
1184280	1186680	making it an even more interesting sort of cult hit
1186680	1187800	than its predecessor,
1187800	1190120	and it's because of the aesthetic differences
1190120	1191640	of playing a film on a TV.
1191640	1193240	All of a sudden, the shot composition
1193240	1194040	isn't as important
1194040	1195320	because it's kind of far away from you
1195320	1196280	and you're doing something else
1196280	1197400	in the room while it plays
1197400	1198840	and the low quality of the format
1198840	1200040	means that even if the shots
1200040	1201080	were particularly good,
1201080	1202760	you wouldn't really have noticed anyway.
1202760	1204280	You aren't having the aimless banter
1204280	1205560	about nothing blasted at you
1205560	1206760	from speakers all around you
1206760	1208520	like it's the most important thing in the world
1208520	1210440	and you have to listen to every second.
1210440	1211480	It's playing nearby
1211480	1212760	and you're just kind of listening in
1212760	1214600	on these people talking free associatively
1214600	1216040	about their film opinions.
1216040	1218200	With this change in the viewing experience,
1218200	1219080	all of a sudden,
1219080	1220760	More Rats makes sense.
1220760	1222200	It becomes a funny little film
1222200	1223800	where the big scenes and funnier jokes
1223800	1224600	grab your attention
1224600	1225640	and the stuff that falls flat
1225640	1226760	or isn't so well-directed
1226760	1227640	doesn't matter so much
1227640	1229080	because it's easier to ignore.
1229080	1231560	Here's an IMDb review from 2003.
1231560	1234200	Brad C-2 from Auckland, New Zealand
1234200	1235800	jokingly says the film is best watched
1235800	1237000	with your eyes closed.
1237000	1239080	They criticize the look and feel of the film
1239080	1240680	and the hamminess of the overall plot
1240680	1241800	but they loved the dialogue
1241800	1243880	and they found it sharp and effervescent
1243880	1245560	and they say it's their favorite film
1245560	1246520	of Kevin Smith's.
1246520	1247560	I would say so far,
1247560	1248200	but honestly,
1248200	1250200	considering the films he made after 2003,
1250200	1252360	More Rats is probably still their favorite.
1252360	1254040	Kevin Smith films screened in a theater
1254040	1254680	on a big screen
1254680	1256120	are arguably missing the point.
1256120	1257320	The joy of these films
1257320	1258920	is in crowding around a small TV
1258920	1259720	at your friend's house
1259720	1260920	and watching little people on it
1260920	1262680	with no pretensions of grandiosity
1262680	1263880	being shitty to customers
1263880	1265400	and talking about their lives.
1265400	1267080	If you've sat down and watched More Rats
1267080	1268440	screened in a high resolution
1268440	1270040	and a cool retro revival screening
1270040	1271320	at your local college,
1271320	1273880	unsubscribe from my channel immediately, Kurt.
1273880	1275000	We talked about this.
1275000	1276520	I don't want to be your friend anymore.
1276520	1278600	Imagine all the films from across history
1278600	1280360	that were doomed to be misunderstood
1280360	1281720	by the theater-going audience
1281720	1282680	whose real destiny
1282680	1284040	was to be truly appreciated
1284040	1285160	on the small screen
1285160	1286360	where the viewer's relationship
1286360	1288120	with the work was completely different.
1288120	1290200	VHS was the first second chance
1290200	1291080	for those films,
1291080	1292600	and it created an appreciation
1292600	1294040	for these kinds of story
1294040	1296360	for televisual filmmaking.
1296360	1298120	You can see this trend happening in reverse
1298120	1299320	as televisions get bigger
1299320	1300680	and their picture becomes clearer
1300680	1302520	and their aspect ratio more film-like.
1302520	1304360	TV shows with a cinematic approach
1304360	1305560	like Breaking Bad,
1305560	1306040	Mad Men,
1306040	1306760	The Sopranos,
1306760	1307320	or Hannibal
1307320	1309240	are becoming more prominent and popular.
1309240	1311480	HBO calls itself home box office
1311480	1313000	because the home viewing experience
1313000	1315000	is finally akin enough to a theater
1315000	1316200	that these aesthetic changes
1316200	1317640	can really be appreciated.
1317640	1318920	People didn't just not care
1318920	1319960	about having television
1319960	1321960	that wasn't very nice-looking for 60 years.
1321960	1323720	Our relationship with the screen
1323720	1325160	simply changed in accordance
1325160	1326360	with its change in format
1326360	1328120	and size in our living rooms.
1328120	1330600	In the age of HD and TV on demand,
1330600	1332440	soap operas are waning in popularity
1332440	1333640	as the increased fidelity
1333640	1335480	and the typical viewer's filmic awareness
1335480	1337240	expose the show's production failings
1337240	1338440	and straightforwardness
1338440	1340120	more than the older ways could,
1340120	1341480	and the idea that you could be watching
1341480	1342920	Game of Thrones or House of Cards
1342920	1344200	at any time
1344200	1345480	suddenly makes neighbors
1345480	1346760	a bit less of a thing
1346760	1348120	that you might want to watch,
1348120	1349240	although people still watch it
1349240	1349960	all the time over here
1349960	1351160	and it's a little bit scary.
1351160	1352200	They make it in Australia,
1352200	1353160	but they make it for us
1353160	1354680	because we're the only people who watch it.
1354680	1355160	Why are weâ€”
1355160	1356120	I'm a little bit worried
1356120	1357640	this might once again make it harder
1357640	1359160	for some films to be appreciated
1359160	1360120	because you even watch them
1360120	1361320	like a film at home,
1361320	1362520	but it's not like we're gonna just
1362520	1364280	stop making television shows,
1364280	1366200	so we're probably fine for now.
1370600	1373080	People will always want higher fidelity versions
1373080	1374200	of their favorite films.
1374200	1375640	Some people want a high-res version
1375640	1377160	of the original cuts of Star Wars
1377160	1378920	so badly that they've resorted
1378920	1380520	to making that version themselves
1380520	1381720	with different restorations
1381720	1383720	pulling from 35mm prints,
1383720	1385160	70mm prints,
1385160	1386360	a TV broadcast,
1386360	1387560	DVD special features,
1387560	1388920	and more all in the service
1388920	1390040	of recreating the films
1390040	1391800	they remember from way back when.
1391800	1393320	You can also see this battle happening
1393320	1394680	on the filmmaking end.
1394680	1396280	A filmmaker will always find
1396280	1398360	newer and better cameras on the market,
1398360	1399320	more bit depth,
1399320	1400440	better codecs,
1400440	1403480	1080p, 4K, 6K, 8K sensors,
1403480	1405080	all for footage that will often end up
1405080	1406680	getting seen on YouTube
1406680	1407720	at whatever resolution
1407720	1409240	their audience's computer monitors
1409240	1410840	or phone screens happen to be
1410840	1412440	with YouTube's compression algorithm
1412440	1413960	eradicating most of the specs
1413960	1415000	of their footage.
1415000	1416840	Looking good doesn't necessarily mean
1416840	1418280	having the best definition.
1418280	1419800	Telling a good story is the goal,
1419800	1421000	and if you get that wrong,
1421000	1422840	not even doing it on an Arri Alexa
1422840	1423640	can save you.
1423640	1425160	Obviously, shoot on the best equipment
1425160	1426120	you can get your hands on
1426120	1427720	and aim for a form of distribution
1427720	1429160	that best suits your work,
1429160	1430440	but I think the real challenge
1430440	1431480	is to make something that people
1431480	1432520	would fall in love with
1432520	1433800	even if they were watching it
1433800	1436120	on a crappy old tape in the 90s,
1436120	1437000	and in its own way,
1437000	1438120	whether we like it or not,
1438120	1439800	those tapes and the impact they had
1439800	1440840	will never leave us.
1440840	1442360	The format is in our history now,
1442360	1443560	and we remember it.
1443560	1444840	Nostalgia is real,
1444840	1446680	and it affects how we view old films
1446680	1447800	or perceive new films
1447800	1449480	that use it as a purposeful style.
1449480	1450760	Many films made in the vein
1450760	1452120	of 80s or 90s horror
1452120	1454200	get limited little VHS releases
1454200	1455080	because that's the style
1455080	1456520	they were courting in the first place.
1456520	1458120	Then there are the immensely popular
1458120	1460280	retro camcorder phone apps you can get
1460280	1462040	and the web skits that use the aesthetic
1462040	1463480	as part of a deeper throwback
1463480	1465960	to kitschy 90s children's programming.
1465960	1467560	Many new films exist only
1467560	1468520	in the form of tapes
1468520	1469800	or what are designed to look like
1469800	1471000	low-res rips of tapes
1471000	1472600	like the truly fascinating,
1472600	1475320	funny, and smart WNUF Halloween special
1475320	1476760	in order to channel the style
1476760	1478120	and further create a sense
1478120	1479480	of seeing a documented record
1479480	1480440	of a time period.
1480440	1481960	One film that combines all of this
1481960	1483320	with tapes' ability to make
1483320	1484680	cheap special effects look better
1484680	1486600	is the found footage film VHS,
1486600	1488360	an anthology of a bunch of short films
1488360	1490120	from various diegetic videotapes,
1490120	1491720	and its relative low-budget effects
1491720	1493640	are done real justice by the aesthetic.
1493640	1495960	The final segment, 10-31-98,
1495960	1498360	has a truly fascinating climactic sequence
1498360	1500440	where everything goes completely crazy nuts
1500440	1502040	and it's the most frighteningly real
1502040	1503640	a horror segment with what are actually
1503640	1506120	fairly rudimentary effects has ever felt
1506120	1507960	because the poor quality of the footage
1507960	1509640	makes it so much more believable.
1509640	1511000	If you filmed a window
1511000	1513240	actually sliding out of existence
1513240	1515240	and hands coming out of the walls
1515240	1517080	on a camera from this time period,
1517080	1518680	it would literally look exactly
1518680	1520040	the same as this footage,
1520040	1521960	and knowing that makes this sequence
1521960	1524760	infinitely punchier and more real-feeling
1524760	1525880	than the same effect would
1525880	1527240	in any modern horror film.
1532040	1535240	Growing up, I think the first favorite film
1535240	1537560	I ever had was Terry Gilliam's
1537560	1538840	Time Bandits.
1538840	1541080	I think it was the first film I ever saw
1541080	1542200	where seeing it I felt like
1542200	1543240	it was made for me.
1543880	1545880	It took my sense of alienation
1545880	1548040	from adult life and channeled it
1548040	1549240	into telling a story about
1549240	1550840	a vividly imaginative world
1550840	1552520	where the outsiders were the ones
1552520	1553640	who were truly free,
1553640	1555160	escaping from their parents,
1555160	1557400	invading armies, and even the will of God
1557400	1559640	in getting what they wanted out of life.
1559640	1561640	It made me feel good to not be
1561640	1562760	like everyone else,
1562760	1563880	like I was getting won over
1563880	1565240	on the world somehow.
1565240	1567080	This film helped make me who I am
1567080	1568840	and shape how I see everything,
1568840	1571560	and it did it on my dad's tiny television
1571560	1573560	in letterbox widescreen.
1573560	1575160	Obviously, for the sake of preservation
1575160	1576200	and film history,
1576200	1577560	a high-res official version
1577560	1579000	of handshooting first would be nice
1579080	1579720	to have.
1579720	1581560	We can chase higher and higher resolutions
1581560	1582360	as much as we want,
1582360	1583000	and we should.
1583000	1584200	I think they look great.
1584200	1586360	But the funny and kind of amazing thing is
1586920	1588680	millions of people only needed
1588680	1591000	a fifth of those lines of resolution
1591000	1592520	on a tiny screen
1592520	1594200	to fall in love with these films
1594200	1596520	and have them shape how they see the world.
1596520	1598440	For me, Time Bandits is
1598440	1599960	the objectively crappy version
1599960	1601480	I saw as a kid over and over
1601480	1603400	on a tiny widescreen tape
1603400	1605400	in the night when no one else was around,
1605400	1607480	feeling inspired by the sense of adventure
1607480	1608600	and briefly pausing
1608600	1610280	to go to the kitchen for a snack
1610280	1612040	and get scared by the floor.
1612040	1613560	All the Ks in the world
1613560	1614920	won't replicate the experience
1614920	1616040	I had as a kid.
1616040	1617160	It might even ruin it
1617160	1618920	by revealing all the obvious models
1618920	1619800	and matte paintings
1619800	1621240	and all the wood screws on the sets
1621240	1622520	for what they really were.
1622520	1625400	VHS was always a kind of bad format.
1625960	1628040	But in spite and because
1628040	1629720	of all its problems,
1629720	1632360	it caused a dramatic shift in pop culture
1632360	1634520	and in the taste and approaches to cinema
1634520	1635720	by viewing audiences
1635720	1638040	which is still felt to this very day
1638040	1639720	in the form of the cinema literacy
1639720	1641320	and particular feel and taste
1641320	1643160	it cultivated even by accident
1643160	1643960	with its style.
1648800	1650800	Oh no, look what happened by accident.
1725720	1727760	Oh no, look what happened by accident.
1755720	1757760	Oh no, look what happened by accident.
