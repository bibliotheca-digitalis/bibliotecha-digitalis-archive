1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
You know, it's been pretty great over the last couple of years developing something of an audience, you know, a following and YouTube subscribers and

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,320
fans and people on Twitter who want to know what I have to say about stuff.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,560
But to be honest, it's getting kind of annoying. I'm kind of sick of having them.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,240
So I thought the best way to get rid of them would be to start a new YouTube video series

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,040
exploring the theory and philosophy and politics of various aspects of film that I feel aren't explored enough.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
That should do the trick and along the way I might remind people of some of my more

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,400
contrarian opinions like the fact I think the Star Wars prequels are actually pretty good. Stuff like that. I just did it then, didn't I?

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,680
Welcome to Scanline.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:09,960
If you're older than the age of 20 or have parents that don't throw things out,

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,160
then you probably have at least a couple of these things in an attic or a shed somewhere.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,860
These are video home system cassette tapes, commonly known as VHS tapes. They entered use in the late

12
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,200
1970s and were a very popular way of watching films and TV shows in your own home anytime you wanted,

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,280
which for the time was a really novel and new concept.

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,360
With SelectaVision, you can go to the movies at your house!

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,160
I know this because I looked it up on the Wikipedia page when I was writing this script.

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,760
But let's get into what the world's largest ence,

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,440
Lie-clopedia, doesn't want you to know.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,120
If you weren't in front of the TV when a show aired or hadn't gone to the cinema when a film was out, your primary

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,360
interaction with most pieces of modern entertainment and culture would have been through the medium of VHS.

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,360
Almost every piece of audio-visual art you consumed, no matter what it was made with, shot on, or how advanced the budget and special effects,

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,680
you saw it via the signal produced from the magnetic reels in these plastic boxes.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,440
If you fell in love with a story, it was probably thanks to these tapes.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,680
It's a pity, then, that they look like shit.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,760
A standard PAL VHS recording consisted of roughly 320 horizontal lines and

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
576 vertical lines of visual information.

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,680
Worse, you wouldn't actually be getting your films at that resolution.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Since most films were produced in wide or super wide screen,

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
but VHS was for the 4x3 resolution of contemporary televisions,

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,160
you had a problem even showing a film.

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,520
You could crop out the sides of a film and move the screen around, what's called pan and scan,

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,200
which could totally ruin the story of films where multiple things were happening on different sides of the frame,

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,440
or you could scale the whole thing down and add black bars to the top and bottom,

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
creating what was called the letterbox effect.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,200
On the pan and scan version of A New Hope, the opening text crawl doesn't fit the screen,

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,240
so you have to wait until it gets here before you can even possibly read it.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,880
In the widescreen version, you can see the entire line of text as soon as it enters the frame,

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,480
but it's scaled down, so it's just as hard to read.

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
I always really liked the scene from Aliens where Burke is trying to be friendly with Ripley in hospital,

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,160
so he brings Jonesy in and sits backwards in his chair and spins playfully in it while the camera pulls in

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,200
and gets more intimate, so he can then tell her that she's been frozen for 57 years.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,360
There's lots of good moments of subtle acting and characterization,

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,440
and I like the cinematography of this cool sci-fi room, and there's a cute cat in the frame, too.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,520
The pan and scan version of this scene just barely manages to get both characters in the frame at once.

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,800
It completely removes a lot of Burke's body language as he tries to be nice while preparing to break the news to her,

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
and poor Jonesy's head is cut off.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,920
Jonesy isn't in this film after the beginning.

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Does Jonesy over here look happy with pan and scan?

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,840
I don't think he does, but I can't actually tell.

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,920
Even worse, because of the vile machinations of capitalism,

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,880
the first preferred solution by movie studios was pan and scan,

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,800
so they sold all the films like that,

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,120
and then, once they figured out that directors hated having their films recut to fit the new frame

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,320
and widescreen was basically objectively superior because it displayed the entire film,

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,720
they got to sell you the films all over again with the promise that this time it was better.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Now, for the first time on video,

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,640
you can savor the true experience of these blockbusters in their original format.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
Widescreen.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,440
My copy of the Aliens special editionâ€”

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,920
sorry, the Aliens special edition?

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,360
Apparently I bought this tape from a xenomorph?

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,560
Opens with a commercial for the widescreen versions of Alien and Die Hard.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,840
Fuckers.

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,520
And guess what? This version of Aliens is in pan and scan!

64
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,880
This is already the special edition of Aliens,

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,760
and now you're telling me I'm gonna have to buy it again when the widescreen special edition comes out?

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,600
20th Century Fox? More like 22nd Century Weyland-Yutani?

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
And that was it.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,440
That was how people watched films.

70
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,080
They picked their poison between a tiny version of the original film

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,680
or a recut, reframed, gutted, despicable, cat-erasing version of the original,

72
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,280
and whichever one you picked, you got it in this flickery format.

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,720
You got this facsimile of the film that you wanted to see.

74
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,160
And that was how we consumed media.

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,280
For decades.

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,240
Some versions of the above-average fantasy film series Star Wars only ever widely existed on this format.

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,280
Many fans of Star Wars all over message boards and forums and my mentions

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,880
fell in love with the films because of tapes they rented or bought.

79
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,960
Because of this.

80
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,280
But wait a minute.

81
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,200
We can talk about specs and make fun of the video quality all day.

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,560
People still watched them, people still used them to record shows off the TV,

83
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,400
and people still shared and circulated those recordings.

84
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,560
Thanks to people wanting to see things and needing tape to do so,

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,880
homemade tapes are still the only way to find copies of shows that weren't available in any official format.

86
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Many episodes of Mystery Science Theater didn't get a proper release for years after their initial air date,

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,080
and many still don't.

88
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,560
Prior to high-speed internet, the only way of accessing these old episodes

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,520
was through home recordings people happened to have made at the time the show aired.

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,640
You'd be amazed at what hoops folks would jump through to see a show they liked,

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,800
even on a low-res home tape recording.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,400
And what if you were a fan of anime in the era prior to major home video releases of foreign animation?

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Why, you would have to hope you knew a store with crazy import stuff with really poor fan translations

94
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,320
or hope someone had taped the shows that did make it over at the crazy times they turned up.

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,400
In retrospect, the format wasn't great,

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
but it was certainly good enough for audiences who wanted to watch something

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,880
in the comfort of their own homes whenever they wanted to,

98
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,520
and it was basically the first format that allowed people to do this.

99
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
It led to widespread consumption of material that would otherwise be forgotten or go unseen.

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,320
In the 70s and 80s, for the first time ever,

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,040
a regular person could have an archive of shows or films they enjoyed

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,400
without having to get a projector and go in search of film reels on eBay,

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,160
which would be really hard to do, considering that eBay didn't exist until 1995.

104
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
A person could learn about and consume elements of their culture

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,000
and develop an understanding of film so much more easily than the decades prior.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,800
In fact, Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith worked in local video stores before becoming directors,

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,240
giving them an opportunity to further incubate their own passion for film

108
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,000
as well as share it directly with others

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,960
before going on to make some of the most influential films, for better or worse, of the 1990s.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,000
The advent of VHS ushered in a new era of accessibility for film fans.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Tastes in film and appetites for film could be developed much more rapidly than ever before.

112
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,120
It marked the beginning in a radical and permanent shift in media consumption.

113
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,240
You were no longer reliant on what was playing in your local multiplex

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,760
or what old French films the weird art schools were projecting that month,

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,480
and you no longer had to adhere rigidly to TV schedules

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,960
or catch films or TV shows deigned worthy of being shown.

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,760
The shift was so radical that film companies panicked.

118
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Then-MPAA head Jack Valenti, in an act of comical hyperbole,

119
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,160
said in a congressional hearing that the VCR is to the American film producer

120
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,400
and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone.

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,160
Universal Studios even sued Sony on the grounds of copyright infringement

122
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,640
over their Betamax video recording format.

123
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,880
Luckily, it was ruled that home recording devices operate under fair use,

124
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,240
and of course, once film companies realized how profitable home video could be, they backed off.

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,200
Many films started being made with their sales on the burgeoning

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,560
and seemingly never-endingly hungry VHS market in mind,

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,480
or even without the intent of ever being screened in a theater.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Some were barely even films.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,960
They were instructional videos or Christmas-themed cat nightmares

130
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,160
or musical propaganda for a Christian cult that lived in the woods.

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,560
Lots of popular films did well on tape, but still others did hugely well on tape,

132
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,400
more so than you could expect from their cinematic release or critical reception.

133
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
The question here is why.

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,200
What is it about being available on VHS that made people suddenly become connoisseurs of horror or independent film?

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,080
Well, those reasons tend to get overlooked.

136
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
Let's look at some of them right now.

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,640
[â™ª Music begins to fade out â™ª

138
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
When making the film Jaws, which would come to be regarded as the first ever summer blockbuster,

139
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,760
Spielberg and co. discovered some problems with the shark prop,

140
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,600
a prop many would regard as quite important in a film about a shark that eats people.

141
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
The animatronics kept breaking down, bits kept falling off of it,

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,400
and most importantly, it kept sinking.

143
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,880
The fake shark had trouble floating in water.

144
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,840
Spielberg instead had to rely on using shots of almost everything but the shark

145
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,920
to demonstrate the horror of its presence,

146
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,280
show the aftermath, show explosions of blood in the distance, show the actor's reactions.

147
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,240
The result was a film where you barely ever get to see the animatronic shark,

148
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,280
but its presence is felt regardless.

149
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,160
The shark is rendered even scarier by not being shown in all its glory,

150
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,880
and its glory wasn't really all that much to see anyway.

151
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,520
It was a broken mechanical shark.

152
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,600
Toby Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an incredibly startling and foundational film in the horror genre.

153
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,320
When James Fuhrman, a British censor and secretary of the BBFC at the time,

154
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,800
tried to cut the film to reduce its violent and nightmarishly oppressive atmosphere,

155
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,640
he found, to his own personal shock, that he couldn't.

156
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,680
There isn't all that much actual violence or blood in the film.

157
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,760
There are no single pieces or shots you could remove to diminish its effects.

158
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,600
Instead, it's a cumulative effect of all the properties of the entire film

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,080
in setting a tone and creating a mood without needing to show you anything in particular.

160
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,080
In the end, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was refused a certification by the BBFC,

161
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,560
effectively banning it in the United Kingdom.

162
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,760
What these stories tell us is that even in visual mediums,

163
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,920
supposedly all about showing people things,

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,960
for achieving some effects, often less is more.

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,840
The human mind is incredibly good at scaring itself,

166
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,520
and sometimes not being shown what you're supposed to be scared of is the worst thing.

167
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,400
Confusion settles in, fear of what could be there, what could happen fills your head,

168
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
and your imagination, with its own particular fears,

169
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,520
gets to substitute those over whatever's actually there.

170
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,680
Texas Chainsaw Massacre did fantastically well when it was released in 1981,

171
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,400
allowing many Brits access to the film for the first time,

172
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,080
but many horror films did well on tape,

173
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,880
even if they relied much more on gore or were poorly cut,

174
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,240
and this is because of a particular form of this principle.

175
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,920
Let's think about VHS again.

176
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,720
That awful, tiny resolution, flickery screen,

177
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,040
even pure blackness is off-kilter.

178
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,360
If you walked into a room with this playing,

179
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,160
you might even think you're watching a scene of something hiding in darkness.

180
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,680
I bet you can almost make out a figure hidden there in all the noise.

181
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,440
You see where I'm going with this now, don't you?

182
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Here's Alien, one of the best, most emotionally intense and scary films ever on VHS,

183
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,120
and through these tapes, Alien was flipping terrifying.

184
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,440
I remember being out of my mind scared by this low-res monstrosity,

185
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,760
and it wasn't just because of the great acting,

186
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,240
directing, editing, creature design, or music.

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,280
It was because in all the tensest and darkest moments,

188
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,320
you could never really quite be sure what you were looking at.

189
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,520
Abstract shapes in the background could almost look like something else.

190
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
The flickers and noise in the darkness

191
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,760
were easily confused for glimpses of the monster.

192
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,000
Even when you were sure nothing was there,

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,760
you could never really be sure.

194
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,040
When the monster actually turned up, it was almost a relief.

195
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Like, at least now, you knew where the creature actually was.

196
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,600
-â™ª You never let it go â™ª

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
-â™ª You never let it go â™ª

198
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,800
Dallas?

199
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,520
In other words, a lower-resolution format

200
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,320
can increase the emotional impact of a scene.

201
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,160
Horror and suspense have the chance to strike people like it never had before.

202
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,400
No wonder films like this did well.

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,280
In some ways, modern high-resolution versions of these films

204
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,840
can't quite capture that particular magic.

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,760
Here's a scene from the Blu-ray version.

206
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,160
It looks great, but it's not as scary

207
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,360
because you can quite definitely see that nothing's there.

208
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,880
You know the character is alone in ways that you couldn't be certain of before.

209
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,280
Really good films actually put this principle into practice

210
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,720
within the medium itself.

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,520
For example, Alien and Aliens both have sequences

212
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,240
that prominently feature the use of cameras and video feeds

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,680
with a very poor signal.

214
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,920
Even if the higher-resolution version of the film

215
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,840
does diminish some of the horror elements,

216
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,040
these segments still hold up exactly like they always did

217
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,600
because the effects of viewing low-resolution video

218
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
are worked into the aesthetic of the film.

219
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,480
As a kid, David Cronenberg rotated his TV antenna

220
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,560
to pick up signals he wasn't supposed to access

221
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,120
late at night when there wasn't supposed to be anything on the air.

222
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,040
Well, what if the images that you pulled up

223
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,320
were really quite extreme, disturbing, possibly illegal,

224
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,000
and what would you think then?

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,880
Would you keep seeking out those channels

226
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,600
or would you call the police or what would you do?

227
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,200
How would you respond to that?

228
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,880
The fear and excitement he felt in anticipation of what he might see,

229
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,600
that fear of what was out there hidden in the static,

230
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,280
inspired him to make Videodrome,

231
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,200
so at least one great horror film

232
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,000
was conceived entirely because of this effect.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Horror and slasher films did really well on tape for this reason,

234
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,960
and many films became long-running series

235
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,480
that probably wouldn't ever have done so

236
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,720
without such successful post-cinema releases

237
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,040
on a format that arguably made them scarier.

238
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,680
Even boring or flat shots in mediocre films

239
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,840
can be made more tense by telling the audience

240
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,760
a killer is out to get the protagonists

241
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,440
and making it just a little bit tougher

242
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,200
to see where they could be hiding.

243
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,720
This also solves another problem.

244
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Those of you who watched my, in retrospect,

245
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,440
woefully unfocused and unresearched video from 2016

246
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,040
about what makes action films work

247
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,240
will remember I made a comment

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,600
about how the CGI in Terminator 2 used to look better.

249
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,720
Well, here we are.

250
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,960
Thank you, Shannon, for helping me edit this video

251
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
and stop it taking another year.

252
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,120
Computer graphics and animation were largely lacking

253
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,920
in the 80s, 90s, and even the early 2000s.

254
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
Nothing really quite looked right,

255
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,440
things didn't feel like they were really there,

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,680
texture and displacement mapping wasn't up to snuff,

257
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,640
and you had smooth-looking weird stuff in your frame.

258
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
It wasn't great.

259
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,880
But even mediocre CGI can blend right in on tape.

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,960
This checkerboard man rising out of the floor

261
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,000
to murder a guy made me scared of my kitchen floor

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,560
going to the fridge at night as a hyperactive child.

263
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,880
It was vivid, like in my mind's eye,

264
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,960
Robert Patrick was gonna come out at any moment

265
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,040
and cut my entire body off.

266
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,760
Seeing the now easily available high-definition version

267
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
of this scene made me feel like an idiot.

268
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,880
My mind had done most of the work with the bad fidelity.

269
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,960
I think people who saw this scene in a theater

270
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,600
kind of had the scariest bits of the film ruined for them

271
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,200
because in the film prints shown in theaters,

272
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
this would have stuck out just as much.

273
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,200
But it wasn't just the relative badness of the image

274
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,040
that popularized certain things over others

275
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,200
in the medium of the video home system.

276
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,280
Another important facet was the fact that,

277
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,360
well, it was in your home.

278
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,000
Like I said before,

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Texas Chainsaw Massacre was effectively not allowed

280
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,880
into cinemas when it was first released in the UK.

281
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,480
While some local councils allowed it

282
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
to be shown in their theaters,

283
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,840
the viewing experience would have been quite weird.

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,920
You'd be openly going out and paying to sit

285
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,240
and see something you knew was banned in other areas

286
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
for being violent and horrific.

287
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,440
It was like you were committing a crime

288
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,320
or were openly telling people you wanted to see that stuff

289
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,160
since you'd actively gone and sorted out.

290
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,200
But the uncensored 1981 video release did amazingly,

291
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,640
and it's quite clear why.

292
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,720
Instead of going out and sitting in a public space

293
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,200
for 90 minutes and then awkwardly shuffling out

294
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,040
trying not to make eye contact with the other people

295
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,360
who'd come to see this widely banned film,

296
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,440
you saw it with an audience of your choosing

297
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,240
in the privacy of your own home at a time that suited you.

298
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,480
There was a sense of being free of judgment.

299
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,640
The eyes of the outside world were no longer a factor

300
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,080
in your viewing experience.

301
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,160
This encouraged people to seek out films

302
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,840
they'd never go to see in public,

303
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,920
which, of course, includes pornography.

304
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
It's really not hard to see why home video

305
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,880
almost immediately killed porn theaters.

306
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,480
Kevin Smith has happily recounted

307
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,160
his time renting porn to customers,

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,560
saying,

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,680
and that having a frank conversation

310
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
with someone about their sex life

311
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
informed his work a great deal.

312
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,440
Home viewing also allowed for a less adult form of privacy,

313
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,840
a kind of comfortable intimacy with friends or family

314
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,520
that you can't get in a theater.

315
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,680
Getting together on the couch with a bowl of popcorn

316
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,920
and the glow of a television to watch a scary movie

317
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,840
is an oft-repeated familial ritual

318
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,160
in much the same way that gathering around a campfire

319
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,240
bathed in orange light to tell ghost stories

320
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,760
has been for generations.

321
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,040
There are also other factors.

322
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
You might have noticed that prior to the 90s,

323
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,600
television was shot very straightforwardly and blankly

324
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,040
with actors even in close-ups

325
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,680
framed very differently from films shot at the same time.

326
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,360
This is because televisual language

327
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,840
has to serve a different purpose from film language.

328
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,560
Movies are giant, projected way up and away from you,

329
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,040
staring down at you and occupying your entire view.

330
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,880
You are consumed by a film

331
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,120
and encouraged to think about it and its composition.

332
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,880
You don't do anything else in a cinema

333
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,920
but watch the film.

334
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,520
A television is a smaller screen,

335
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,800
often a good distance from you,

336
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,320
even in a kitchen where other noises

337
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,680
and events are distracting you.

338
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,960
You might even be reading a book

339
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,200
or talking to someone else while the TV is playing.

340
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,120
The early TV production style knew

341
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,520
that you weren't always going to be paying attention,

342
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,120
only pulling you in for the more dramatic

343
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,880
or important moments of a given episode,

344
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,520
usually using something like having music start to play.

345
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,680
The smaller screen also changes the way we relate

346
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,200
to the image and the people in it.

347
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,280
Television can be more human, friendlier.

348
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,400
Those little people on the screen

349
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,160
are having a nice chat about current events

350
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,400
and I feel somewhat included or informed.

351
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,240
A talk show blown up to 70 feet,

352
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,000
staring down at you in a darkened room

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,920
with surround sound blasting in your ears

354
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,080
would be overpowering to say the least.

355
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,960
And it turns out the aesthetic and design

356
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,080
of some films are predisposed to mesh beautifully

357
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,000
with the qualities of the television.

358
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Nothing exemplifies this in practice

359
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,760
quite like Mallrats.

360
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,040
Mallrats was Kevin Smith's second film,

361
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,120
produced after the success of his first picture,

362
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,600
the small, self-funded indie hit, Clerks.

363
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,080
When Mallrats came out, no one really got it.

364
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,240
People who loved the low-budget, avant-garde,

365
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,560
doing-it-ourselves, grainy aesthetic of Clerks

366
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,360
hated the well-produced, overly slick feel.

367
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,840
People who cared about editing or cinematography

368
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,640
or good-looking shots got a kind of flat-looking film

369
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,480
with a bunch of boring wide shots

370
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,120
of multiple people just sort of talking about stuff.

371
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
Serious critics, into the pointed,

372
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,200
pop-culturally slanted insights of Clerks

373
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
and the honest thoughts of astray Gen Xers,

374
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
were treated to a bunch of wacky characters

375
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,880
farting about in a mall,

376
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,240
tricking people they didn't like

377
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,480
into making their hands smell like shit.

378
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,920
The film did terribly critically and at the box office.

379
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
It looked like Kevin Smith,

380
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,600
the indie darling behind Clerks,

381
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,280
had basically torched his career

382
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,040
with only his second film.

383
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,480
Luckily, a film would then come out

384
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,200
which would miraculously untorch his career.

385
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,320
That film was called Mallrats on Tape.

386
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,600
In 2001, on the subject of criticism of his films,

387
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,400
Smith said,

388
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
"'We should be able to make any movie we want,

389
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,280
stupid or not,

390
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,800
so long as it doesn't cost too much

391
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,920
and is reasonably guaranteed

392
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,840
to make its money back for our distributor.'

393
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,120
That, for the curious,

394
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,360
is why we're allowed to keep making movies.

395
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,320
Some cats--"

396
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,160
Oh, I hate how he talks.

397
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,080
Some cats, particularly the denizens

398
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,760
of internet movie chat boards,

399
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,120
can't figure out why we're allowed

400
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,440
to continue lensing flicks

401
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,000
when we never seem to grow as visual storytellers

402
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,560
or keep making, what's to them, the same movie.

403
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,040
The answer is that we've never lost anybody money.

404
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,080
I'll say that again.

405
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,400
We've never lost anybody money.

406
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,240
Granted, we came close with Rats,

407
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
but even that made a killing on video

408
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,640
and, more recently, DVD.

409
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,320
Despite box office troubles,

410
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,240
the same film no one went to see

411
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,360
and critics snubbed

412
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,280
was suddenly doing gangbusters,

413
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,680
making it an even more interesting sort of cult hit

414
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,800
than its predecessor,

415
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,120
and it's because of the aesthetic differences

416
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,640
of playing a film on a TV.

417
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,240
All of a sudden, the shot composition

418
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,040
isn't as important

419
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
because it's kind of far away from you

420
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,280
and you're doing something else

421
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,400
in the room while it plays

422
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,840
and the low quality of the format

423
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,040
means that even if the shots

424
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,080
were particularly good,

425
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
you wouldn't really have noticed anyway.

426
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
You aren't having the aimless banter

427
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,560
about nothing blasted at you

428
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
from speakers all around you

429
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,520
like it's the most important thing in the world

430
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,440
and you have to listen to every second.

431
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,480
It's playing nearby

432
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,760
and you're just kind of listening in

433
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,600
on these people talking free associatively

434
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,040
about their film opinions.

435
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,200
With this change in the viewing experience,

436
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,080
all of a sudden,

437
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,760
More Rats makes sense.

438
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,200
It becomes a funny little film

439
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,800
where the big scenes and funnier jokes

440
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,600
grab your attention

441
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,640
and the stuff that falls flat

442
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,760
or isn't so well-directed

443
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,640
doesn't matter so much

444
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,080
because it's easier to ignore.

445
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,560
Here's an IMDb review from 2003.

446
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,200
Brad C-2 from Auckland, New Zealand

447
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,800
jokingly says the film is best watched

448
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
with your eyes closed.

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,080
They criticize the look and feel of the film

450
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,680
and the hamminess of the overall plot

451
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
but they loved the dialogue

452
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,880
and they found it sharp and effervescent

453
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,560
and they say it's their favorite film

454
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,520
of Kevin Smith's.

455
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,560
I would say so far,

456
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,200
but honestly,

457
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
considering the films he made after 2003,

458
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,360
More Rats is probably still their favorite.

459
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,040
Kevin Smith films screened in a theater

460
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,680
on a big screen

461
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
are arguably missing the point.

462
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,320
The joy of these films

463
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,920
is in crowding around a small TV

464
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,720
at your friend's house

465
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
and watching little people on it

466
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,680
with no pretensions of grandiosity

467
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
being shitty to customers

468
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
and talking about their lives.

469
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,080
If you've sat down and watched More Rats

470
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,440
screened in a high resolution

471
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,040
and a cool retro revival screening

472
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,320
at your local college,

473
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,880
unsubscribe from my channel immediately, Kurt.

474
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,000
We talked about this.

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,520
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

476
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,600
Imagine all the films from across history

477
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,360
that were doomed to be misunderstood

478
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,720
by the theater-going audience

479
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,680
whose real destiny

480
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,040
was to be truly appreciated

481
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,160
on the small screen

482
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,360
where the viewer's relationship

483
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,120
with the work was completely different.

484
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,200
VHS was the first second chance

485
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,080
for those films,

486
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,600
and it created an appreciation

487
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,040
for these kinds of story

488
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,360
for televisual filmmaking.

489
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,120
You can see this trend happening in reverse

490
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,320
as televisions get bigger

491
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
and their picture becomes clearer

492
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,520
and their aspect ratio more film-like.

493
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,360
TV shows with a cinematic approach

494
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,560
like Breaking Bad,

495
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Mad Men,

496
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,760
The Sopranos,

497
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,320
or Hannibal

498
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,240
are becoming more prominent and popular.

499
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,480
HBO calls itself home box office

500
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
because the home viewing experience

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
is finally akin enough to a theater

502
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
that these aesthetic changes

503
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,640
can really be appreciated.

504
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
People didn't just not care

505
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,960
about having television

506
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
that wasn't very nice-looking for 60 years.

507
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,720
Our relationship with the screen

508
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,160
simply changed in accordance

509
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,360
with its change in format

510
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,120
and size in our living rooms.

511
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,600
In the age of HD and TV on demand,

512
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,440
soap operas are waning in popularity

513
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,640
as the increased fidelity

514
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,480
and the typical viewer's filmic awareness

515
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,240
expose the show's production failings

516
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,440
and straightforwardness

517
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,120
more than the older ways could,

518
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,480
and the idea that you could be watching

519
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,920
Game of Thrones or House of Cards

520
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,200
at any time

521
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,480
suddenly makes neighbors

522
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,760
a bit less of a thing

523
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,120
that you might want to watch,

524
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,240
although people still watch it

525
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,960
all the time over here

526
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,160
and it's a little bit scary.

527
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,200
They make it in Australia,

528
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,160
but they make it for us

529
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
because we're the only people who watch it.

530
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,160
Why are weâ€”

531
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm a little bit worried

532
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,640
this might once again make it harder

533
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,160
for some films to be appreciated

534
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,120
because you even watch them

535
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
like a film at home,

536
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,520
but it's not like we're gonna just

537
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,280
stop making television shows,

538
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,200
so we're probably fine for now.

539
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,080
People will always want higher fidelity versions

540
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,200
of their favorite films.

541
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,640
Some people want a high-res version

542
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
of the original cuts of Star Wars

543
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,920
so badly that they've resorted

544
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,520
to making that version themselves

545
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,720
with different restorations

546
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
pulling from 35mm prints,

547
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
70mm prints,

548
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,360
a TV broadcast,

549
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
DVD special features,

550
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,920
and more all in the service

551
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,040
of recreating the films

552
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,800
they remember from way back when.

553
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,320
You can also see this battle happening

554
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,680
on the filmmaking end.

555
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,280
A filmmaker will always find

556
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,360
newer and better cameras on the market,

557
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,320
more bit depth,

558
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,440
better codecs,

559
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,480
1080p, 4K, 6K, 8K sensors,

560
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,080
all for footage that will often end up

561
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,680
getting seen on YouTube

562
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,720
at whatever resolution

563
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,240
their audience's computer monitors

564
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
or phone screens happen to be

565
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
with YouTube's compression algorithm

566
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,960
eradicating most of the specs

567
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,000
of their footage.

568
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,840
Looking good doesn't necessarily mean

569
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,280
having the best definition.

570
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,800
Telling a good story is the goal,

571
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
and if you get that wrong,

572
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,840
not even doing it on an Arri Alexa

573
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,640
can save you.

574
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,160
Obviously, shoot on the best equipment

575
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,120
you can get your hands on

576
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,720
and aim for a form of distribution

577
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
that best suits your work,

578
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,440
but I think the real challenge

579
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,480
is to make something that people

580
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,520
would fall in love with

581
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,800
even if they were watching it

582
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,120
on a crappy old tape in the 90s,

583
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,000
and in its own way,

584
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,120
whether we like it or not,

585
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,800
those tapes and the impact they had

586
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,840
will never leave us.

587
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,360
The format is in our history now,

588
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,560
and we remember it.

589
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,840
Nostalgia is real,

590
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,680
and it affects how we view old films

591
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,800
or perceive new films

592
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,480
that use it as a purposeful style.

593
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,760
Many films made in the vein

594
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,120
of 80s or 90s horror

595
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,200
get limited little VHS releases

596
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,080
because that's the style

597
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
they were courting in the first place.

598
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,120
Then there are the immensely popular

599
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,280
retro camcorder phone apps you can get

600
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,040
and the web skits that use the aesthetic

601
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,480
as part of a deeper throwback

602
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,960
to kitschy 90s children's programming.

603
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,560
Many new films exist only

604
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,520
in the form of tapes

605
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,800
or what are designed to look like

606
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
low-res rips of tapes

607
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,600
like the truly fascinating,

608
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,320
funny, and smart WNUF Halloween special

609
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,760
in order to channel the style

610
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,120
and further create a sense

611
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,480
of seeing a documented record

612
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,440
of a time period.

613
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
One film that combines all of this

614
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,320
with tapes' ability to make

615
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,680
cheap special effects look better

616
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,600
is the found footage film VHS,

617
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,360
an anthology of a bunch of short films

618
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,120
from various diegetic videotapes,

619
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,720
and its relative low-budget effects

620
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,640
are done real justice by the aesthetic.

621
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,960
The final segment, 10-31-98,

622
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,360
has a truly fascinating climactic sequence

623
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,440
where everything goes completely crazy nuts

624
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,040
and it's the most frighteningly real

625
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,640
a horror segment with what are actually

626
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,120
fairly rudimentary effects has ever felt

627
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,960
because the poor quality of the footage

628
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,640
makes it so much more believable.

629
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,000
If you filmed a window

630
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,240
actually sliding out of existence

631
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
and hands coming out of the walls

632
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,080
on a camera from this time period,

633
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,680
it would literally look exactly

634
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
the same as this footage,

635
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,960
and knowing that makes this sequence

636
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,760
infinitely punchier and more real-feeling

637
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,880
than the same effect would

638
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,240
in any modern horror film.

639
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,240
Growing up, I think the first favorite film

640
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,560
I ever had was Terry Gilliam's

641
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,840
Time Bandits.

642
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,080
I think it was the first film I ever saw

643
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,200
where seeing it I felt like

644
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,240
it was made for me.

645
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
It took my sense of alienation

646
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,040
from adult life and channeled it

647
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,240
into telling a story about

648
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,840
a vividly imaginative world

649
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,520
where the outsiders were the ones

650
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,640
who were truly free,

651
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,160
escaping from their parents,

652
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,400
invading armies, and even the will of God

653
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,640
in getting what they wanted out of life.

654
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
It made me feel good to not be

655
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,760
like everyone else,

656
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,880
like I was getting won over

657
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,240
on the world somehow.

658
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,080
This film helped make me who I am

659
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,840
and shape how I see everything,

660
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,560
and it did it on my dad's tiny television

661
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
in letterbox widescreen.

662
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,160
Obviously, for the sake of preservation

663
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,200
and film history,

664
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,560
a high-res official version

665
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,000
of handshooting first would be nice

666
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,720
to have.

667
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,560
We can chase higher and higher resolutions

668
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,360
as much as we want,

669
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,000
and we should.

670
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
I think they look great.

671
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,360
But the funny and kind of amazing thing is

672
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,680
millions of people only needed

673
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,000
a fifth of those lines of resolution

674
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,520
on a tiny screen

675
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,200
to fall in love with these films

676
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,520
and have them shape how they see the world.

677
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,440
For me, Time Bandits is

678
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,960
the objectively crappy version

679
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,480
I saw as a kid over and over

680
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,400
on a tiny widescreen tape

681
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
in the night when no one else was around,

682
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,480
feeling inspired by the sense of adventure

683
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,600
and briefly pausing

684
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,280
to go to the kitchen for a snack

685
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,040
and get scared by the floor.

686
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,560
All the Ks in the world

687
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,920
won't replicate the experience

688
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,040
I had as a kid.

689
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,160
It might even ruin it

690
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,920
by revealing all the obvious models

691
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,800
and matte paintings

692
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,240
and all the wood screws on the sets

693
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,520
for what they really were.

694
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,400
VHS was always a kind of bad format.

695
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,040
But in spite and because

696
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,720
of all its problems,

697
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,360
it caused a dramatic shift in pop culture

698
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,520
and in the taste and approaches to cinema

699
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
by viewing audiences

700
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,040
which is still felt to this very day

701
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,720
in the form of the cinema literacy

702
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,320
and particular feel and taste

703
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,160
it cultivated even by accident

704
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,960
with its style.

705
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Oh no, look what happened by accident.

706
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,760
