14440	17880	Christmas and New Years are always a time of sadness and horror for me.
17880	19660	Not because I don't get on with any of my relatives.
19660	22600	They're great and I've forgiven them for almost all of their crimes.
22600	26400	No, the last decade of holidays have been a nightmare for me
26400	31880	because I've had to prepare for yet another knife in the back of Doctor Who.
31880	35160	I mean, who can forget the Christmas Invasion
35160	38360	in which the Doctor farts around in bed for 40 minutes
38360	42840	and then at the end he wakes up and has a sword fight in his pajamas with Bloodskull Man.
42840	44280	That's his name. Don't go and check.
44280	46960	Partway through the fight, he loses a hand, but not really.
46960	49000	It comes back and he wins.
49000	51160	Yay! Woo!
51160	55640	Oh, by the way, that hand turns out to be an incredibly important plot device 22 episodes later,
55640	58040	so I hope you were paying attention on Christmas Day.
58040	59920	Oh, and 16 episodes after that,
59920	62480	the Doctor doesn't want to change his appearance while regenerating,
62480	65040	so he pours his excess energy into the hand
65040	67280	and it forms a new version of the Doctor
67280	69840	who goes off to live with Rose in an alternate universe.
69840	74480	Look, all I'm saying is this Christmas special has a lot to answer for
74480	76080	and it will not be forgiven.
76080	79360	I've brought you...
79360	80720	No second chances.
80720	83240	["Jingle Bells"]
83240	86240	["Jingle Bells"]
86240	87400	["Buzzer"]
87400	90280	Or who can forget the 2007 Christmas special,
90280	91480	Voyage of the Damned,
91480	94160	which is set on the Titanic but in space
94160	95960	and Kylie Minogue is in it
95960	97880	and there's robot angels
97880	101640	and they portray the Doctor as a literal messiah figure
101640	103360	on Christmas Day.
103360	108640	This episode incurred criticism not only from fringe religious groups for, you know, this,
108680	113720	but also from the last living survivor of the actual Titanic.
113720	117840	But a spokeswoman for the show insisted no offense was intended.
117840	121320	Voyage of the Damned is set on a spaceship called the Titanic
121320	122840	and not a boat.
122840	126120	This year, however, might at least prove to be the last
126120	128840	bizarre Christmas nightmare I'll have to endure
128840	132320	because this year is the end of Stephen Moffat's...
132320	135920	occupation of the Doctor Who showrunner position.
135920	138320	His regime is ending.
138320	141560	And that means this year might truly be cause for celebration,
141560	144520	even more than spending time with your loved ones.
144520	147720	Let's take a look at Moffat's final episode of the show
147720	150680	and then speculate about what Doctor Who can get up to
150680	153560	now that it's finally free of his grasp.
153560	156800	["Jingle Bells"]
156800	159040	It-it talks if you press it,
159040	161800	but in the last take, I, like, threw it at the camera
161800	164360	and it hit the ground and stopped making the noise.
164360	166080	So we're gonna have to roll that take now.
167080	172080	["Jingle Bells"]
172080	177080	["Jingle Bells"]
177080	182080	["Jingle Bells"]
182080	183080	["Jingle Bells"]
183080	184080	["Jingle Bells"]
184080	185080	["Jingle Bells"]
185080	187080	If you've seen my Sherlock video,
187080	189080	which, um, I think a couple of you might have done,
189080	191080	you'll already know that Moffat's relationship
191080	192080	with Doctor Who is lifelong.
192080	194080	He was a fan of the original series
194080	196080	and he wrote the children-in-need charity spoof
196080	198080	of Doctor Who, which was actually the first appearance
198080	200080	of the Doctor on television for quite some time.
200080	202080	It ended, perhaps fittingly,
202080	204080	with the Doctor regenerating into a woman.
204080	206080	Now, when I saw this years ago,
206080	208080	I thought, wow, wouldn't that be nice?
208080	210080	But I realize in retrospect,
210080	213080	after reading some recent comments by Moffat,
213080	215080	that this, to him, was meant as a joke.
215080	217080	And, of course, my sonic screwdriver.
217080	220080	Oh, look, it's got three settings.
220080	222080	Doctor, stop that!
222080	225080	Ha-ha, the Doctor keeps dying in silly little ways
225080	226080	and regenerating.
226080	228080	What's the next comical thing he can regenerate into?
228080	230080	Oh, a woman. Ha-ha-ha.
230080	231080	Oh, I imagine.
231080	233080	A woman Doctor, that's a laugh, right?
233080	235080	Back before Moffat was showrunner,
235080	237080	when all he'd done was work on several
237080	239080	critically praised comedies
239080	241080	and the best episodes of the show so far,
241080	243080	and that one other really, really bad show,
243080	245080	which we pretended didn't happen, you know,
245080	247080	we did him a favor, it was easy to interpret
247080	249080	having the Doctor regenerate into Joanna Lumley
249080	251080	as this cool, progressive thing,
251080	254080	like, hey, why not have a female incarnation?
254080	257080	But Moffat's actual intent is made much more clear
257080	259080	by closer inspection and, of course,
259080	261080	by his more recent statements.
261080	264080	This isn't a show exclusively for progressive liberals.
264080	266080	This is also for people who voted Brexit.
266080	268080	That's not me politically at all.
268080	271080	But we have to keep everyone on board.
271080	273080	I haven't actually met a Scottish person before.
273080	275080	Okay, firstly, credit to Stephen
275080	277080	for recognizing the mysterious correlation
277080	279080	between people who voted Brexit
280080	282080	with a female Doctor, but secondly,
282080	284080	isn't it telling that he views
284080	286080	casting a woman as a move
286080	288080	for progressive liberals?
288080	290080	Like, is that really the only reason
290080	292080	anyone would ever think
292080	294080	to cast a woman in this role?
294080	296080	Moffat's approach rears its head in the special itself
296080	298080	with the first Doctor's, shall we say,
298080	301080	ironic sexist comments?
301080	303080	Older gentlemen, like women,
303080	305080	can be put to use.
305080	307080	You can't say things like that.
307080	309080	Look how silly this old man is being.
309080	312080	Hey, remember casual misogyny? Hilarious.
312080	314080	Look how far we and the Doctor have come.
314080	316080	But writing like that loses its appeal
316080	318080	when it's written by the man who had
318080	320080	several great opportunities to actually
320080	322080	cast a woman as this character
322080	324080	and didn't because he was worried about
324080	326080	upsetting the kind of people who actually
326080	328080	think like that. That's not to say
328080	330080	I don't think Capaldi was a good choice for the Doctor.
330080	332080	Like almost all the actors this show gets
332080	334080	nowadays, he does a great job
334080	336080	with the material he's
336080	338080	given, and season eight was
338080	340080	almost all right, but even the episodes
340080	342080	of the show written by other writers are affected
342080	344080	by Moffat's poor plans as showrunner
344080	346080	for the overall direction of the wider story.
346080	348080	While most of the good episodes, like Mummy on the
348080	350080	Orient Express or Flatline, get to be their
350080	352080	own thing, there's still a lot of mucking about
352080	354080	with this overarching story about deciding
354080	356080	whether or not the Doctor's secretly a bad guy
356080	358080	who kills people, and it's bad,
358080	360080	and Missy, a mysterious
360080	362080	figure who keeps meeting up with people who died
362080	364080	during each episode, so a fairly
364080	366080	decent chunk of each writer's episode gets
366080	368080	stolen to serve Moffat's inevitable
368080	370080	nonsense season finale.
370080	372080	Moffat's plans weaken the individual episodes
372080	374080	not just by literally leeching away precious
374080	376080	script pages they could have used to tell the
376080	378080	story at hand, but it also means the individual
378080	380080	writers can't really do anything
380080	382080	with the Doctor or his companion for
382080	384080	that season, Clara, because that would risk messing
384080	386080	up whatever big character moments Moffat
386080	388080	had planned for the end of the season.
388080	390080	The characters couldn't really develop their relationships
390080	392080	with each other or change as people.
392080	394080	At best, sometimes Clara realizes the
394080	396080	Doctor's not always the best guy, and then changes
396080	398080	her mind in the next episode and goes to hang out with
398080	400080	him again. Capaldi and Smith's Doctors
400080	402080	didn't get to develop or grow the way
402080	404080	Eccleston and Tennant's did. You couldn't
404080	406080	really have an episode quite like Dalek
406080	408080	or The Empty Child in a show led this way,
408080	410080	and that's especially sad because
410080	412080	Moffat wrote one of those episodes. Moffat's
412080	414080	approach as a showrunner inadvertently
414080	416080	prevents these kinds of episodes and
416080	418080	great moments that define a series from
418080	420080	happening, and that just really sucks.
420080	422080	The third Capaldi series
422080	424080	was basically a soft reboot. The first episode
424080	426080	was even called The Pilot.
426080	428080	The Doctor gets reintroduced in a new context
428080	430080	as a prestigious professor. Hey, Steve,
430080	432080	wouldn't it have been great if we'd
432080	434080	written a bunch of episodes that show him
434080	436080	reaching this point in his life?
438080	440080	I mean, literally, like, a whole season
440080	442080	of television could have been written about how the Doctor
442080	444080	ends up where he is and the place he's at at the start
444080	446080	of this season, and they just don't! It just
446080	448080	starts here! That's a whole
448080	450080	season of storytelling you could have had
450080	452080	gone! Bill was in this season
452080	454080	and I think she starts out as a really interesting
454080	456080	companion, but then the series
456080	458080	kind of is sort of generic
458080	460080	the whole way through, so she doesn't really
460080	462080	get to be as interesting as I think she could have been.
462080	464080	It's clear that Moffat still has
464080	466080	no idea how to pace a full
466080	468080	season of television. Long story short,
468080	470080	at the end of that season, Bill dies,
470080	472080	sort of, and the Doctor saves the day
472080	474080	but is critically injured in the process, and he
474080	476080	starts to regenerate. He wanders out into
476080	478080	the South Pole and meets the First Doctor,
478080	480080	which is where our Christmas special picks
480080	482080	up. I will now attempt
482080	484080	to recount in full
484080	486080	the plot of the 2017
486080	488080	Doctor Who Christmas special.
488080	490080	The story begins
490080	492080	with that meeting again. Then, for some reason,
492080	494080	time stops. Then, a First
494080	496080	World War soldier, played by Mark
496080	498080	Gatiss, because why not, is about
498080	500080	to die, but then time stops for him
500080	502080	as well, and then he gets pulled into
502080	504080	the North Pole at the same time as the
504080	506080	two Doctors. An entity reveals
506080	508080	itself and abducts the TARDIS
508080	510080	and demands they hand over the soldier,
510080	512080	and then manifests a new version of Bill
512080	514080	who the Doctor thought had died.
514080	516080	The Doctor doesn't want to hand the soldier over
516080	518080	without getting more information, so
518080	520080	instead of asking what's happening,
520080	522080	they all, uh, run
522080	524080	away and pretend to let
524080	526080	the TARDIS get stolen, and then they
526080	528080	all run off to the other Doctor's TARDIS
528080	530080	to go to a planet we haven't seen before
530080	532080	where the Doctor claims we'll find the biggest
532080	534080	database in the world. The Doctor
534080	536080	assumes this glass lady
536080	538080	thing, uh, is based
538080	540080	on a real person and just needs a really big database
540080	542080	to look them up, for some reason.
542080	544080	The database shoots at the
544080	546080	Doctor, but gives up when it realizes
546080	548080	he's already dying, for some reason.
548080	550080	It turns out to be the Dalek
550080	552080	from that one episode two seasons
552080	554080	ago where they all went into a Dalek
554080	556080	and made it want to kill other Daleks by accident
556080	558080	while trying to turn it good.
558080	560080	He's just sort of hanging
560080	562080	out here shooting Daleks whenever
562080	564080	they turn up to shoot him. So it turns
564080	566080	out that Daleks are all hooked up
566080	568080	into some special, uh,
568080	570080	mega mainframe that's
570080	572080	the biggest database in the world.
572080	574080	The Doctor tries to convince it to
574080	576080	tell him who the glass lady is. Meanwhile,
576080	578080	the manifestation of Bill keeps turning
578080	580080	into the glass lady, uh,
580080	582080	and sort of messing
582080	584080	with the soldier and the Doctor, but not actually doing
584080	586080	anything with them. They just, she just sort of turns
586080	588080	into glass when they're not looking,
588080	590080	and then nothing happens.
590080	592080	Um, it doesn't actually do anything.
592080	594080	Anyway, the Dalek looks up the lady's face
594080	596080	and it turns out that she's
596080	598080	the creator of a future humanities
598080	600080	time-traveling
600080	602080	supercomputer designed to, get this,
602080	604080	abduct everyone who ever dies
604080	606080	from time and scan
606080	608080	their memories at the moment of their deaths
608080	610080	and then put them back, uh,
610080	612080	to build a big database of
612080	614080	all of their memories. The Doctor
614080	616080	realizes there was no threat,
616080	618080	uh, this episode and there were no
618080	620080	stakes, uh, gives up
620080	622080	and, uh, the soldier hands himself over.
622080	624080	Oh.
624080	626080	It's not an evil plan.
626080	628080	I don't really know
628080	630080	what to do when it isn't an evil plan.
630080	632080	We're 40 minutes into the episode, Stephen!
632080	634080	They go back to where he was supposed to die
634080	636080	but then he doesn't because the Doctor
636080	638080	delayed the death by a few hours
638080	640080	and it turns out that it's that
640080	642080	one time all the fighting stopped at Christmas.
642080	644080	Oh, hey, they actually worked
644080	646080	Christmas into it and semi-justified
646080	648080	having this random guy
648080	650080	be the guy who gets abducted. Oh, also
650080	652080	he's an ancestor of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart
652080	653080	for some reason.
653080	655080	Captain Archibald Hamish
655080	657080	Lethbridge-Stewart.
657080	659080	That's a thing that Moffat keeps doing
659080	661080	and I'm really not sure why. The entity
661080	663080	which it turns out is called Testimony
663080	665080	brings out Nardole as well
665080	667080	so, uh, he can say bye to them
667080	669080	and then also Clara who he forgot
669080	671080	because of time bullshit in the last season
671080	673080	but Testimony gives him
673080	675080	his memories back using magic
675080	677080	and then both Doctors give up
677080	679080	and decide to regenerate
679080	681080	out of spite.
681080	683080	Capaldi gives a speech to his next self
683080	685080	saying that they should be nice to people.
685080	687080	This scene would probably be a real
687080	689080	tearjerker if it was attached to an episode
689080	691080	of television with any stakes or plot
691080	693080	and then he finally goes out the way
693080	695080	we all wish we would by
695080	697080	exploding violently into
697080	699080	light and fire while transforming
699080	701080	into Jodie Whittaker.
701080	703080	Sigh.
703080	705080	I have a few
705080	707080	small questions.
707080	709080	Why didn't the entity just explain itself
709080	711080	and make it clear it didn't have any ulterior motives
711080	713080	the way it happily did once the Doctor
713080	715080	asked a Dalek to Google it for him?
715080	717080	Why did it threaten him at all considering
717080	719080	that it has the memories of everyone who ever died
719080	721080	so it knows all about him
721080	723080	and knows that he's a peaceful guy
723080	725080	who doesn't need to be threatened?
725080	727080	Why did the Doctor decide the only solution
727080	729080	was to go find that one Dalek from two seasons
729080	731080	ago and didn't get mentioned again?
731080	733080	How does he know where it ended up?
733080	735080	Why, if the Dalek hates
735080	737080	Daleks and wants to kill Daleks and can
737080	739080	clearly see down to the ground level
739080	741080	and make fairly accurate shots,
741080	743080	has it not killed all the de-shelled
743080	745080	and still alive Daleks squirming around
745080	747080	on the surface where it can definitely see them?
747080	749080	I mean, the catchphrase is exterminate
749080	751080	not I'm gonna break off your
751080	753080	outer casing and then just sort of
753080	755080	chill out and wait for someone
755080	757080	to come here and have a half-baked
757080	759080	horror scene where one of them squirms
759080	761080	on Mark Gatiss' face for five seconds.
761080	763080	Why has the Dalek since
763080	765080	also decided it wants to kill the Doctor?
765080	767080	Why does it give up when it
767080	769080	sees that he's already dying?
769080	771080	And even if, for some reason, it's decided
771080	773080	that the best thing to do is leave
773080	775080	the dying to die without
775080	777080	killing them, why does it actually believe
777080	779080	he's dying even though it definitely
779080	781080	knows Time Lords regenerate?
781080	783080	Because A, Daleks know how Time Lords work.
783080	785080	That's like one of their, like, main things.
785080	787080	And B, Daleks apparently
787080	789080	have a mega hive mind super database
789080	791080	bigger than the one the Time Lords
791080	793080	have. Next question, why
793080	795080	did the Daleks have a comprehensive mega
795080	797080	hive mind super database bigger than
797080	799080	the Time Lords have? Who, by the way,
799080	801080	are the lords of all of time.
801080	803080	And who plugged all these bloody wires
803080	805080	in? It doesn't even have arms.
805080	807080	It's just a plunger and a whisk.
807080	809080	How did he? Why a
809080	811080	World War I soldier?
811080	813080	Why didn't the Bill Potts entity just
813080	815080	explain itself right away and clear everything
815080	817080	up instead of insisting she was real?
817080	819080	Why undo the Doctor forgetting
819080	821080	Clara in the last five minutes of
821080	823080	the last run of the last episode
823080	825080	of this incarnation even being around?
825080	827080	Why did testimony
827080	829080	pretend they got away
829080	831080	for a while and unfreeze time
831080	833080	even though they happily froze it again
833080	835080	partway through the scene with
835080	837080	the Dalek? Why bring back this Dalek
837080	839080	for, like, a two minute conversation
839080	841080	that doesn't actually progress its story or
841080	843080	relationship with the Doctor at all and imparts
843080	845080	five seconds of exposition and yet
845080	847080	spend half the episode farting around
847080	849080	on the planet getting to it? Why were there
849080	851080	no stakes whatsoever?
851080	853080	And most importantly,
853080	855080	what exactly was Stephen Moffat
855080	857080	actually trying to do?
857080	859080	Um...
859080	861080	I think I figured out the answer
861080	863080	to that question at least. Remember
863080	865080	the end of time, the last special with Russell
865080	867080	T. Davies in charge and the last one
867080	869080	with David Tennant as the Doctor
869080	871080	where he saves the day and makes a heroic sacrifice
871080	873080	and then starts to regenerate? Remember
873080	875080	how the regeneration started and there was still
875080	877080	like 20 minutes of the Doctor
877080	879080	going around saying bye to everyone?
879080	881080	Even old companions who we hadn't seen
881080	883080	for quite a while like Rose and Martha
883080	885080	and we even find out what they've been up to in the interim
885080	887080	like that Martha and Mickey got married
887080	889080	and all the memorable alien creatures we met
889080	891080	get to say goodbye and or be
891080	893080	hit by a hammer by him
893080	895080	one last time? I love that stuff!
895080	897080	It was the end of both the lead actors and
897080	899080	showrunners tenure on the series so
899080	901080	they gave a proper send off to all the characters
901080	903080	from that era of the show, some recurring
903080	905080	others small but memorable enough that
905080	907080	it was great we got to see them one last time.
907080	909080	They even bring back Alonzo!
909080	911080	Alonzo! The guy from a Christmas special
911080	913080	three years ago who we didn't see
913080	915080	again comes back to feature
915080	917080	in David Tennant's victory lap and
917080	919080	that's just great! It got a
919080	921080	little bit silly having the dying Doctor
921080	923080	say bye to everyone before
923080	925080	his heroic sacrifice actually kicked in
925080	927080	but it was kind of nice to
927080	929080	remember how good the story had been
929080	931080	overall until that point. It's a nice
931080	933080	changing of the guard moment
933080	935080	since the old recurring cast
935080	937080	mostly goes away after this point along with
937080	939080	the lead actor and the producers and lead
939080	941080	writer went too so it's kind of
941080	943080	cool that this era of Doctor Who
943080	945080	got to say goodbye to itself in this big
945080	947080	way. It's clear that Moffat
947080	949080	sort of wanted to do that for
949080	951080	himself. Remember that with this episode's
951080	953080	invention of testimony, Moffat
953080	955080	could have written in a meeting with
955080	957080	almost any character he wanted
957080	959080	ever because
959080	961080	testimony's literally a database
961080	963080	of every human who has ever died.
963080	965080	Moffat could bring anyone
965080	967080	back to say bye to them
967080	969080	but then he discovered that he hadn't
969080	971080	created any characters worth going back
971080	973080	to and finding and reminding us about.
973080	975080	This is a serious question. Who else
975080	977080	from Moffat's episodes for the last
977080	979080	five years does anyone actually
979080	981080	remember? Oh yeah, I really
981080	983080	missed the sinister puddle
983080	985080	or all eight flavors of
985080	987080	the new Dalek gumdrop brigade.
987080	989080	Just kidding, everyone quietly tried
989080	991080	to forget that redesign and even Moffat
991080	993080	said they were a mistake. All the memorable Moffat
993080	995080	written characters I'd ever want to see again
995080	997080	happened before he was running it.
997080	999080	So Moffat's opportunity to say bye to all
999080	1001080	of his beloved characters amounts to
1001080	1003080	Clara, Nardole,
1003080	1005080	Bill, the first
1005080	1007080	doctor, and
1007080	1009080	what, this Dalek? Can't even say bye
1009080	1011080	to Emily Pond either because Karen Gillan's
1011080	1013080	too busy on Jumanji or Guardians
1013080	1015080	of the Galaxy or
1015080	1017080	Untitled Avengers film? Now I really
1017080	1019080	did want to answer the question of why Moffat would decide
1019080	1021080	to have this Dalek and
1021080	1023080	this planet in his last episode.
1023080	1025080	Well, luckily, I've tuned
1025080	1027080	my brain into the dunce
1027080	1029080	who thinks he's smart wavelength so
1029080	1031080	I know what Moffat was trying here.
1031080	1033080	The planet he goes to here is called
1033080	1035080	Villengard by the Doctor in a seemingly
1035080	1037080	throwaway line.
1037080	1039080	That's actually a place referred
1039080	1041080	to in a similar throwaway line
1041080	1043080	previously in a part Moffat wrote for season
1043080	1045080	one back in 2005.
1045080	1049080	In fact,
1049080	1051080	I used that scene in the Sherlock
1051080	1053080	video as an example of Moffat's good
1053080	1055080	writing. It was a reference to something cool
1055080	1057080	the Doctor did that we never got to see
1057080	1059080	and in retrospect it's a huge red
1059080	1061080	flag as to his major problems as a showrunner
1061080	1063080	but it's a kind of line that works
1063080	1065080	in a show run like this season was
1065080	1067080	where the Doctor actually does
1067080	1069080	stuff and interacts with
1069080	1071080	the story so it's like Moffat's
1071080	1073080	coming full circle by having the Doctor
1073080	1075080	go in the last episode he's gonna write
1075080	1077080	to a place mentioned in the first episode
1077080	1079080	he wrote. This is clever
1079080	1081080	but in a very
1081080	1083080	particular kind of way.
1083080	1085080	All it does is make the few people
1085080	1087080	who'll even get the reference feel clever
1087080	1089080	and I remember a time
1089080	1091080	when Doctor Who had loftier goals
1091080	1093080	than that. It's not a problem
1093080	1095080	in itself that he did it or anything,
1095080	1097080	it's just indicative of the structural flaws
1097080	1099080	in his work that he put in the effort of making
1099080	1101080	references like this to his own previous stories
1101080	1103080	but not enough to write a story
1103080	1105080	that was good and worked on its own
1105080	1107080	which I think is a flaw. Moffat
1107080	1109080	is so short on old familiar faces
1109080	1111080	from his run to say goodbye to
1111080	1113080	that it brings back that Dalek they ran around
1113080	1115080	inside of for an episode and had that
1115080	1117080	scene I used in the Sherlock video as an example
1117080	1119080	of really poor writing.
1119080	1121080	I am not a good Dalek.
1121080	1123080	You are a good Dalek.
1125080	1127080	Because people don't believe there could be any
1127080	1129080	such thing as a good Dalek.
1131080	1133080	I am not a good Dalek.
1133080	1135080	You are a good Dalek.
1135080	1137080	It's so weird
1137080	1139080	that the last thing Stephen Moffat is ever
1139080	1141080	going to write for Doctor Who
1141080	1143080	features two of
1143080	1145080	the best and worst things
1145080	1147080	of his writing that I singled out
1147080	1149080	in a video I made that got really popular
1149080	1151080	shoehorned into each other.
1151080	1153080	Like, is he calling me out?
1153080	1155080	Has he seen
1155080	1157080	the video?
1157080	1159080	Are you watching this now, Stephen?
1159080	1161080	Or did he really think everyone was dying
1161080	1163080	to see what happened to Rusty the Dalek?
1163080	1165080	I hope you all recognize the
1165080	1167080	importance of the Dalek being called Rusty
1167080	1169080	by the way. It's a name from the Moffat
1169080	1171080	school of clever references.
1171080	1173080	It's a reference to the previous
1173080	1175080	showrunner, Russ T.
1175080	1177080	Davies. Rusty...
1177080	1179080	The Doctor spent that episode
1179080	1181080	inside the Dalek, trying to save
1181080	1183080	it from within. It's a clumsy
1183080	1185080	metaphor for how Moffat saw his own
1185080	1187080	input on the early series. He was running
1187080	1189080	around loose inside Rusty's machine,
1189080	1191080	making little adjustments and making
1191080	1193080	it better than it was, impacting it
1193080	1195080	in some grand way. Bringing Rusty back
1195080	1197080	here is Moffat's way of tipping his
1197080	1199080	hat to the previous showrunner.
1199080	1201080	It's a pity it takes up a huge chunk of an episode
1201080	1203080	in desperate need of any actual
1203080	1205080	stakes or plot.
1205080	1207080	Oh. It's not an evil plan.
1207080	1209080	Imagine sitting in front
1209080	1211080	of your computer
1211080	1213080	with the script for your final Doctor Who
1213080	1215080	episode, and looking at a
1215080	1217080	screen where you have physically
1217080	1219080	typed the words
1219080	1221080	Oh
1223080	1225080	It's not an evil plan
1225080	1227080	This was all pointless.
1229080	1231080	That's the place where I would do a rewrite
1231080	1233080	or hope that, like, someone would stop
1233080	1235080	me. Why didn't anybody stop
1235080	1237080	him? And worst of all, this could actually
1237080	1239080	have been some kind of neat payoff.
1239080	1241080	An actual answer to the questions raised
1241080	1243080	in one of the earliest Capaldi
1243080	1245080	episodes. Like, has the Doctor
1245080	1247080	changed as a person in the almost three
1247080	1249080	full seasons since these characters met?
1249080	1251080	Has the Dalek changed?
1251080	1253080	How is their relationship going
1253080	1255080	to develop? This could be a genuinely
1255080	1257080	good bookend on this era of the Doctor
1257080	1259080	that I didn't even see coming.
1259080	1261080	Like, maybe something Moffat set
1261080	1263080	up really did actually pay
1263080	1265080	off satisfyingly in a clever way, with
1265080	1267080	this Dalek coming back, and we see how much they've all
1267080	1269080	changed. But time gets stopped
1269080	1271080	mid-conversation when he figures
1271080	1273080	out who Testimony is, and
1273080	1275080	the Dalek never gets to
1275080	1277080	finish the conversation, and we just
1277080	1279080	sort of leave. You know, for maybe
1279080	1281080	like 30 seconds, I actually
1281080	1283080	believed that Moffat had
1283080	1285080	set up an arc for the Doctor
1285080	1287080	that was going to conclude here, and we're gonna
1287080	1289080	see all the ways he's changed
1289080	1291080	by how he deals now with this Dalek,
1291080	1293080	and what conversation are they gonna have?
1293080	1295080	But then it just
1295080	1297080	stops.
1297080	1299080	It just doesn't.
1299080	1301080	I can't believe I let Moffat trick
1301080	1303080	me into thinking he was going to do something
1303080	1305080	smart, even for a minute.
1305080	1307080	I half-expected
1307080	1309080	Rusty to actually be an imaginary
1309080	1311080	invention by the Doctor's sister
1311080	1313080	to help remind him of the best
1313080	1315080	friends she killed, and who he remembers
1315080	1317080	as a dog. No, just kidding.
1317080	1319080	That would be far too stupid, wouldn't it?
1319080	1321080	God, even Testimony and the dead people
1321080	1323080	database thing is a reused idea
1323080	1325080	from a previous Moffat episode.
1325080	1327080	The last two episodes of season eight
1327080	1329080	dealt with a database of the minds
1329080	1331080	of a bunch of people who died and been
1331080	1333080	downloaded into it, and they thought they lived in an
1333080	1335080	afterlife, and fucking hell, when that
1335080	1337080	episode first came out, I thought that idea
1337080	1339080	was trite and had been done before by
1339080	1341080	Moffat. It was a clear ripoff of
1341080	1343080	Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead,
1343080	1345080	two more episodes he wrote featuring
1345080	1347080	a giant library that saves the minds
1347080	1349080	and memories of dead people.
1349080	1351080	The longer his run goes on,
1351080	1353080	the more clear it becomes that
1353080	1355080	Moffat had about four really
1355080	1357080	good ideas, and
1357080	1359080	kept going back to them over and over.
1359080	1361080	["SILENCE IN THE LIBRARY"]

1365080	1367080	So his finale's a wash, along with the
1367080	1369080	rest of his run on the show, but at the very least,
1369080	1371080	it's over, and luckily,
1371080	1373080	since Doctor Who is basically uncancellable,
1373080	1375080	it can weather his
1375080	1377080	oncoming storm.
1377080	1379080	Did you get it? That was a needless reference.
1379080	1381080	I'm very clever. And make it through to the
1381080	1383080	other side and still have a chance
1383080	1385080	of being good next time.
1385080	1387080	That's kind of always been the beauty of
1387080	1389080	old DW. You can have a bad episode
1389080	1391080	and then go somewhere else next time
1391080	1393080	and do something different and try again.
1393080	1395080	I think it's kind of fantastic that
1395080	1397080	we have Doctor Who, this huge,
1397080	1399080	long-running cultural institution.
1399080	1401080	It's just lovely.
1401080	1403080	So I think it's good to be optimistic about the
1403080	1405080	future of the show.
1405080	1407080	Hopefully. Hopefully.
1407080	1409080	Everyone's excited. As excited as I am.
1409080	1411080	I really like Jodie Whittaker as an actress,
1411080	1413080	although, to be honest, I've loved almost all of the actors
1413080	1415080	in Doctor Who. The acting hasn't really been
1415080	1417080	the problem since they got rid of that guy
1417080	1419080	with the rubbish hair people keep claiming is me
1419080	1421080	in the comments of YouTube videos with him in them.
1421080	1423080	I have some, shall we say,
1423080	1425080	mixed opinions
1425080	1427080	about Chris Chibnall, the
1427080	1429080	showrunner who's taking over from Moffat.
1429080	1431080	He's written some pretty good stuff for Doctor Who before
1431080	1433080	and also he was the showrunner on
1433080	1435080	Torchwood, which is a shame,
1435080	1437080	but he also recently created
1437080	1439080	and wrote most of Broadchurch, which
1439080	1441080	Whittaker appeared in heavily, and which also
1441080	1443080	starred David Tennant, which is either
1443080	1445080	definitive proof that the British
1445080	1447080	television industry is a small room
1447080	1449080	with twelve people in it working on five shows
1449080	1451080	between them, or reassuring
1451080	1453080	since the lead writer probably
1453080	1455080	has a good grasp of his new lead's strengths.
1455080	1457080	It's also a really good sign
1457080	1459080	that Chibnall is credited as
1459080	1461080	the Broadchurch guy in pieces talking
1461080	1463080	about him taking over. Broadchurch was
1463080	1465080	really well-received in places and he's
1465080	1467080	been able to step out of the shadow of Doctor
1467080	1469080	Who and develop himself as a writer
1469080	1471080	over the years. It's nice that they're
1471080	1473080	not just promoting in some guy who
1473080	1475080	might have written a few good episodes once
1475080	1477080	but is untested as a lead writer.
1477080	1479080	Instead, they're bringing in someone with experience
1479080	1481080	running a pretty well-received show for
1481080	1483080	three series. It's also probably really nice
1483080	1485080	for Chibnall's career that he's not remembered
1485080	1487080	as the Torchwood guy because
1487080	1489080	I think we all want to forget the
1489080	1491080	Cyberwoman episode he wrote
1491080	1493080	where she's sexy and all
1493080	1495080	decked out in rubber.
1495080	1497080	So, you know, overall, I'm positive about
1497080	1499080	the new lead writer. He's
1499080	1501080	proven he...
1501080	1503080	I mean, there's a chance he
1503080	1505080	could...
1505080	1507080	The vice president of BBC Worldwide
1507080	1509080	says it's one of her favorite episodes of
1509080	1511080	Torchwood's
1511080	1513080	first series
1513080	1515080	and that's a really high watermark for
1515080	1517080	quality. I mean,
1517080	1519080	in terms of LGBT
1519080	1521080	representation, Torchwood
1521080	1523080	is, on the whole, vastly superior
1523080	1525080	to the main Doctor Who series.
1525080	1527080	Lots of
1527080	1529080	ideas just tucked away in a document in case
1529080	1531080	I don't know what to write.
1531080	1533080	Oh, that explains it!
1533080	1535080	Chibnall is the one credited
1535080	1537080	with the decision to have a female
1537080	1539080	doctor so his gender politics
1539080	1541080	can't be completely...
1541080	1543080	They beat the Cyberwoman
1543080	1545080	by spraying her with delicious
1545080	1547080	sauce.
1547080	1549080	So a pterodactyl eats it!
1551080	1553080	Oh, it's gonna be
1553080	1555080	rubbish, isn't it?
1569080	1571080	...
1573080	1575080	...
1583080	1585080	...
1591080	1593080	...
1599080	1601080	...
1601080	1603080	...
