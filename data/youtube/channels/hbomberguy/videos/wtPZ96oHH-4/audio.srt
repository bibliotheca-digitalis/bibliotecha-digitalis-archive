♪♪

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,880
Christmas and New Years are always a time of sadness and horror for me.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,660
Not because I don't get on with any of my relatives.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,600
They're great and I've forgiven them for almost all of their crimes.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,400
No, the last decade of holidays have been a nightmare for me

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,880
because I've had to prepare for yet another knife in the back of Doctor Who.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,160
I mean, who can forget the Christmas Invasion

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,360
in which the Doctor farts around in bed for 40 minutes

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,840
and then at the end he wakes up and has a sword fight in his pajamas with Bloodskull Man.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,280
That's his name. Don't go and check.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,960
Partway through the fight, he loses a hand, but not really.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,000
It comes back and he wins.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,160
Yay! Woo!

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,640
Oh, by the way, that hand turns out to be an incredibly important plot device 22 episodes later,

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,040
so I hope you were paying attention on Christmas Day.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,920
Oh, and 16 episodes after that,

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
the Doctor doesn't want to change his appearance while regenerating,

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
so he pours his excess energy into the hand

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
and it forms a new version of the Doctor

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
who goes off to live with Rose in an alternate universe.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,480
Look, all I'm saying is this Christmas special has a lot to answer for

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,080
and it will not be forgiven.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
I've brought you...

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,720

Voyage of the Damned,

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,160
which is set on the Titanic but in space

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,960
and Kylie Minogue is in it

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,880
and there's robot angels

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,640
and they portray the Doctor as a literal messiah figure

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,360
on Christmas Day.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,640
This episode incurred criticism not only from fringe religious groups for, you know, this,

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,720
but also from the last living survivor of the actual Titanic.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,840
But a spokeswoman for the show insisted no offense was intended.

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,320
Voyage of the Damned is set on a spaceship called the Titanic

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,840
and not a boat.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,120
This year, however, might at least prove to be the last

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,840
bizarre Christmas nightmare I'll have to endure

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,320
because this year is the end of Stephen Moffat's...

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,920
occupation of the Doctor Who showrunner position.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
His regime is ending.

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,560
And that means this year might truly be cause for celebration,

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,520
even more than spending time with your loved ones.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,720
Let's take a look at Moffat's final episode of the show

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,680
and then speculate about what Doctor Who can get up to

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,560
now that it's finally free of his grasp.

It-it talks if you press it,

but in the last take, I, like, threw it at the camera

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,360
and it hit the ground and stopped making the noise.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,080

If you've seen my Sherlock video,

which, um, I think a couple of you might have done,

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
you'll already know that Moffat's relationship

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
with Doctor Who is lifelong.

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
He was a fan of the original series

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
and he wrote the children-in-need charity spoof

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
of Doctor Who, which was actually the first appearance

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
of the Doctor on television for quite some time.

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
It ended, perhaps fittingly,

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
with the Doctor regenerating into a woman.

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Now, when I saw this years ago,

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
I thought, wow, wouldn't that be nice?

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
But I realize in retrospect,

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,080
after reading some recent comments by Moffat,

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
that this, to him, was meant as a joke.

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
And, of course, my sonic screwdriver.

77
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Oh, look, it's got three settings.

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Doctor, stop that!

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Ha-ha, the Doctor keeps dying in silly little ways

80
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
and regenerating.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
What's the next comical thing he can regenerate into?

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Oh, a woman. Ha-ha-ha.

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Oh, I imagine.

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
A woman Doctor, that's a laugh, right?

85
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Back before Moffat was showrunner,

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
when all he'd done was work on several

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
critically praised comedies

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
and the best episodes of the show so far,

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
and that one other really, really bad show,

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
which we pretended didn't happen, you know,

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
we did him a favor, it was easy to interpret

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
having the Doctor regenerate into Joanna Lumley

93
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
as this cool, progressive thing,

94
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
like, hey, why not have a female incarnation?

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
But Moffat's actual intent is made much more clear

96
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
by closer inspection and, of course,

97
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
by his more recent statements.

98
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,080
This isn't a show exclusively for progressive liberals.

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
This is also for people who voted Brexit.

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
That's not me politically at all.

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,080
But we have to keep everyone on board.

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
I haven't actually met a Scottish person before.

103
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Okay, firstly, credit to Stephen

104
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
for recognizing the mysterious correlation

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
between people who voted Brexit

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
with a female Doctor, but secondly,

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
isn't it telling that he views

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
casting a woman as a move

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
for progressive liberals?

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Like, is that really the only reason

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
anyone would ever think

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
to cast a woman in this role?

113
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Moffat's approach rears its head in the special itself

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
with the first Doctor's, shall we say,

115
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,080
ironic sexist comments?

116
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Older gentlemen, like women,

117
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
can be put to use.

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
You can't say things like that.

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Look how silly this old man is being.

120
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Hey, remember casual misogyny? Hilarious.

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Look how far we and the Doctor have come.

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
But writing like that loses its appeal

123
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
when it's written by the man who had

124
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
several great opportunities to actually

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
cast a woman as this character

126
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
and didn't because he was worried about

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
upsetting the kind of people who actually

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
think like that. That's not to say

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I don't think Capaldi was a good choice for the Doctor.

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Like almost all the actors this show gets

131
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
nowadays, he does a great job

132
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
with the material he's

133
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
given, and season eight was

134
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
almost all right, but even the episodes

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
of the show written by other writers are affected

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
by Moffat's poor plans as showrunner

137
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
for the overall direction of the wider story.

138
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
While most of the good episodes, like Mummy on the

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Orient Express or Flatline, get to be their

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
own thing, there's still a lot of mucking about

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
with this overarching story about deciding

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
whether or not the Doctor's secretly a bad guy

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
who kills people, and it's bad,

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
and Missy, a mysterious

145
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
figure who keeps meeting up with people who died

146
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
during each episode, so a fairly

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
decent chunk of each writer's episode gets

148
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
stolen to serve Moffat's inevitable

149
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
nonsense season finale.

150
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Moffat's plans weaken the individual episodes

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
not just by literally leeching away precious

152
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
script pages they could have used to tell the

153
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
story at hand, but it also means the individual

154
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
writers can't really do anything

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
with the Doctor or his companion for

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
that season, Clara, because that would risk messing

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
up whatever big character moments Moffat

158
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
had planned for the end of the season.

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
The characters couldn't really develop their relationships

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
with each other or change as people.

161
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
At best, sometimes Clara realizes the

162
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Doctor's not always the best guy, and then changes

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
her mind in the next episode and goes to hang out with

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
him again. Capaldi and Smith's Doctors

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
didn't get to develop or grow the way

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Eccleston and Tennant's did. You couldn't

167
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
really have an episode quite like Dalek

168
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
or The Empty Child in a show led this way,

169
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
and that's especially sad because

170
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Moffat wrote one of those episodes. Moffat's

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
approach as a showrunner inadvertently

172
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
prevents these kinds of episodes and

173
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
great moments that define a series from

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
happening, and that just really sucks.

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
The third Capaldi series

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
was basically a soft reboot. The first episode

177
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
was even called The Pilot.

178
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
The Doctor gets reintroduced in a new context

179
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
as a prestigious professor. Hey, Steve,

180
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
wouldn't it have been great if we'd

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
written a bunch of episodes that show him

182
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
reaching this point in his life?

183
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I mean, literally, like, a whole season

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
of television could have been written about how the Doctor

185
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
ends up where he is and the place he's at at the start

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
of this season, and they just don't! It just

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
starts here! That's a whole

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
season of storytelling you could have had

189
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
gone! Bill was in this season

190
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
and I think she starts out as a really interesting

191
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
companion, but then the series

192
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
kind of is sort of generic

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
the whole way through, so she doesn't really

194
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
get to be as interesting as I think she could have been.

195
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
It's clear that Moffat still has

196
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
no idea how to pace a full

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
season of television. Long story short,

198
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
at the end of that season, Bill dies,

199
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
sort of, and the Doctor saves the day

200
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
but is critically injured in the process, and he

201
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
starts to regenerate. He wanders out into

202
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
the South Pole and meets the First Doctor,

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
which is where our Christmas special picks

204
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
up. I will now attempt

205
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
to recount in full

206
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
the plot of the 2017

207
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Doctor Who Christmas special.

208
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
The story begins

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
with that meeting again. Then, for some reason,

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
time stops. Then, a First

211
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
World War soldier, played by Mark

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Gatiss, because why not, is about

213
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
to die, but then time stops for him

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
as well, and then he gets pulled into

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
the North Pole at the same time as the

216
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
two Doctors. An entity reveals

217
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
itself and abducts the TARDIS

218
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
and demands they hand over the soldier,

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
and then manifests a new version of Bill

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
who the Doctor thought had died.

221
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
The Doctor doesn't want to hand the soldier over

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
without getting more information, so

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
instead of asking what's happening,

224
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
they all, uh, run

225
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
away and pretend to let

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
the TARDIS get stolen, and then they

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
all run off to the other Doctor's TARDIS

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
to go to a planet we haven't seen before

229
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
where the Doctor claims we'll find the biggest

230
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
database in the world. The Doctor

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
assumes this glass lady

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
thing, uh, is based

233
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
on a real person and just needs a really big database

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
to look them up, for some reason.

235
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
The database shoots at the

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Doctor, but gives up when it realizes

237
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
he's already dying, for some reason.

238
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
It turns out to be the Dalek

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
from that one episode two seasons

240
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
ago where they all went into a Dalek

241
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
and made it want to kill other Daleks by accident

242
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
while trying to turn it good.

243
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
He's just sort of hanging

244
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
out here shooting Daleks whenever

245
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
they turn up to shoot him. So it turns

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
out that Daleks are all hooked up

247
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
into some special, uh,

248
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
mega mainframe that's

249
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
the biggest database in the world.

250
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
The Doctor tries to convince it to

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
tell him who the glass lady is. Meanwhile,

252
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
the manifestation of Bill keeps turning

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
into the glass lady, uh,

254
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
and sort of messing

255
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
with the soldier and the Doctor, but not actually doing

256
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
anything with them. They just, she just sort of turns

257
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
into glass when they're not looking,

258
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
and then nothing happens.

259
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Um, it doesn't actually do anything.

260
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Anyway, the Dalek looks up the lady's face

261
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
and it turns out that she's

262
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
the creator of a future humanities

263
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
time-traveling

264
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
supercomputer designed to, get this,

265
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
abduct everyone who ever dies

266
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
from time and scan

267
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
their memories at the moment of their deaths

268
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
and then put them back, uh,

269
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
to build a big database of

270
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
all of their memories. The Doctor

271
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
realizes there was no threat,

272
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
uh, this episode and there were no

273
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
stakes, uh, gives up

274
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
and, uh, the soldier hands himself over.

275
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Oh.

276
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
It's not an evil plan.

277
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
I don't really know

278
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
what to do when it isn't an evil plan.

279
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
We're 40 minutes into the episode, Stephen!

280
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
They go back to where he was supposed to die

281
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
but then he doesn't because the Doctor

282
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
delayed the death by a few hours

283
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
and it turns out that it's that

284
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
one time all the fighting stopped at Christmas.

285
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Oh, hey, they actually worked

286
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Christmas into it and semi-justified

287
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
having this random guy

288
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
be the guy who gets abducted. Oh, also

289
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
he's an ancestor of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart

290
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
for some reason.

291
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Captain Archibald Hamish

292
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Lethbridge-Stewart.

293
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
That's a thing that Moffat keeps doing

294
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
and I'm really not sure why. The entity

295
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
which it turns out is called Testimony

296
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
brings out Nardole as well

297
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
so, uh, he can say bye to them

298
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
and then also Clara who he forgot

299
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
because of time bullshit in the last season

300
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
but Testimony gives him

301
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
his memories back using magic

302
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
and then both Doctors give up

303
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
and decide to regenerate

304
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
out of spite.

305
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Capaldi gives a speech to his next self

306
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
saying that they should be nice to people.

307
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
This scene would probably be a real

308
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
tearjerker if it was attached to an episode

309
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
of television with any stakes or plot

310
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
and then he finally goes out the way

311
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
we all wish we would by

312
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
exploding violently into

313
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
light and fire while transforming

314
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
into Jodie Whittaker.

315
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Sigh.

316
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
I have a few

317
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
small questions.

318
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Why didn't the entity just explain itself

319
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
and make it clear it didn't have any ulterior motives

320
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
the way it happily did once the Doctor

321
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
asked a Dalek to Google it for him?

322
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Why did it threaten him at all considering

323
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
that it has the memories of everyone who ever died

324
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
so it knows all about him

325
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
and knows that he's a peaceful guy

326
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
who doesn't need to be threatened?

327
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Why did the Doctor decide the only solution

328
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
was to go find that one Dalek from two seasons

329
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
ago and didn't get mentioned again?

330
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
How does he know where it ended up?

331
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Why, if the Dalek hates

332
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Daleks and wants to kill Daleks and can

333
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
clearly see down to the ground level

334
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
and make fairly accurate shots,

335
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
has it not killed all the de-shelled

336
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
and still alive Daleks squirming around

337
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
on the surface where it can definitely see them?

338
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
I mean, the catchphrase is exterminate

339
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
not I'm gonna break off your

340
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
outer casing and then just sort of

341
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
chill out and wait for someone

342
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
to come here and have a half-baked

343
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
horror scene where one of them squirms

344
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
on Mark Gatiss' face for five seconds.

345
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Why has the Dalek since

346
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
also decided it wants to kill the Doctor?

347
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Why does it give up when it

348
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
sees that he's already dying?

349
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
And even if, for some reason, it's decided

350
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
that the best thing to do is leave

351
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
the dying to die without

352
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
killing them, why does it actually believe

353
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
he's dying even though it definitely

354
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
knows Time Lords regenerate?

355
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Because A, Daleks know how Time Lords work.

356
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
That's like one of their, like, main things.

357
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
And B, Daleks apparently

358
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
have a mega hive mind super database

359
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
bigger than the one the Time Lords

360
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
have. Next question, why

361
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
did the Daleks have a comprehensive mega

362
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
hive mind super database bigger than

363
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
the Time Lords have? Who, by the way,

364
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
are the lords of all of time.

365
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
And who plugged all these bloody wires

366
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
in? It doesn't even have arms.

367
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
It's just a plunger and a whisk.

368
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
How did he? Why a

369
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
World War I soldier?

370
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Why didn't the Bill Potts entity just

371
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
explain itself right away and clear everything

372
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
up instead of insisting she was real?

373
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Why undo the Doctor forgetting

374
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Clara in the last five minutes of

375
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
the last run of the last episode

376
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
of this incarnation even being around?

377
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Why did testimony

378
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
pretend they got away

379
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
for a while and unfreeze time

380
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
even though they happily froze it again

381
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
partway through the scene with

382
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
the Dalek? Why bring back this Dalek

383
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
for, like, a two minute conversation

384
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
that doesn't actually progress its story or

385
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
relationship with the Doctor at all and imparts

386
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
five seconds of exposition and yet

387
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
spend half the episode farting around

388
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
on the planet getting to it? Why were there

389
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
no stakes whatsoever?

390
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
And most importantly,

391
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
what exactly was Stephen Moffat

392
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
actually trying to do?

393
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Um...

394
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I think I figured out the answer

395
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
to that question at least. Remember

396
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
the end of time, the last special with Russell

397
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
T. Davies in charge and the last one

398
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
with David Tennant as the Doctor

399
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
where he saves the day and makes a heroic sacrifice

400
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
and then starts to regenerate? Remember

401
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
how the regeneration started and there was still

402
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
like 20 minutes of the Doctor

403
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
going around saying bye to everyone?

404
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Even old companions who we hadn't seen

405
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
for quite a while like Rose and Martha

406
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
and we even find out what they've been up to in the interim

407
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
like that Martha and Mickey got married

408
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
and all the memorable alien creatures we met

409
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
get to say goodbye and or be

410
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
hit by a hammer by him

411
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
one last time? I love that stuff!

412
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
It was the end of both the lead actors and

413
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
showrunners tenure on the series so

414
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
they gave a proper send off to all the characters

415
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
from that era of the show, some recurring

416
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
others small but memorable enough that

417
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
it was great we got to see them one last time.

418
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
They even bring back Alonzo!

419
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Alonzo! The guy from a Christmas special

420
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
three years ago who we didn't see

421
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
again comes back to feature

422
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
in David Tennant's victory lap and

423
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
that's just great! It got a

424
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
little bit silly having the dying Doctor

425
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
say bye to everyone before

426
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
his heroic sacrifice actually kicked in

427
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
but it was kind of nice to

428
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
remember how good the story had been

429
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
overall until that point. It's a nice

430
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
changing of the guard moment

431
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
since the old recurring cast

432
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
mostly goes away after this point along with

433
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
the lead actor and the producers and lead

434
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
writer went too so it's kind of

435
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
cool that this era of Doctor Who

436
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
got to say goodbye to itself in this big

437
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
way. It's clear that Moffat

438
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
sort of wanted to do that for

439
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
himself. Remember that with this episode's

440
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
invention of testimony, Moffat

441
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
could have written in a meeting with

442
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
almost any character he wanted

443
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
ever because

444
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
testimony's literally a database

445
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
of every human who has ever died.

446
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Moffat could bring anyone

447
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
back to say bye to them

448
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
but then he discovered that he hadn't

449
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
created any characters worth going back

450
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
to and finding and reminding us about.

451
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
This is a serious question. Who else

452
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
from Moffat's episodes for the last

453
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
five years does anyone actually

454
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
remember? Oh yeah, I really

455
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
missed the sinister puddle

456
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
or all eight flavors of

457
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
the new Dalek gumdrop brigade.

458
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Just kidding, everyone quietly tried

459
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
to forget that redesign and even Moffat

460
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
said they were a mistake. All the memorable Moffat

461
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
written characters I'd ever want to see again

462
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
happened before he was running it.

463
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
So Moffat's opportunity to say bye to all

464
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
of his beloved characters amounts to

465
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Clara, Nardole,

466
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Bill, the first

467
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
doctor, and

468
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
what, this Dalek? Can't even say bye

469
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
to Emily Pond either because Karen Gillan's

470
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
too busy on Jumanji or Guardians

471
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
of the Galaxy or

472
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Untitled Avengers film? Now I really

473
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
did want to answer the question of why Moffat would decide

474
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
to have this Dalek and

475
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
this planet in his last episode.

476
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Well, luckily, I've tuned

477
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
my brain into the dunce

478
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
who thinks he's smart wavelength so

479
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
I know what Moffat was trying here.

480
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
The planet he goes to here is called

481
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Villengard by the Doctor in a seemingly

482
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
throwaway line.

483
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
That's actually a place referred

484
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
to in a similar throwaway line

485
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
previously in a part Moffat wrote for season

486
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
one back in 2005.

487
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,080
In fact,

488
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
I used that scene in the Sherlock

489
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
video as an example of Moffat's good

490
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
writing. It was a reference to something cool

491
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
the Doctor did that we never got to see

492
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
and in retrospect it's a huge red

493
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
flag as to his major problems as a showrunner

494
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
but it's a kind of line that works

495
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
in a show run like this season was

496
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
where the Doctor actually does

497
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
stuff and interacts with

498
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
the story so it's like Moffat's

499
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
coming full circle by having the Doctor

500
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
go in the last episode he's gonna write

501
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
to a place mentioned in the first episode

502
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
he wrote. This is clever

503
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
but in a very

504
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
particular kind of way.

505
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
All it does is make the few people

506
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
who'll even get the reference feel clever

507
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
and I remember a time

508
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
when Doctor Who had loftier goals

509
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
than that. It's not a problem

510
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
in itself that he did it or anything,

511
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
it's just indicative of the structural flaws

512
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
in his work that he put in the effort of making

513
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
references like this to his own previous stories

514
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,080
but not enough to write a story

515
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
that was good and worked on its own

516
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
which I think is a flaw. Moffat

517
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
is so short on old familiar faces

518
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
from his run to say goodbye to

519
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
that it brings back that Dalek they ran around

520
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
inside of for an episode and had that

521
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
scene I used in the Sherlock video as an example

522
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
of really poor writing.

523
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
I am not a good Dalek.

524
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
You are a good Dalek.

525
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Because people don't believe there could be any

526
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
such thing as a good Dalek.

527
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I am not a good Dalek.

528
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
You are a good Dalek.

529
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
It's so weird

530
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
that the last thing Stephen Moffat is ever

531
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
going to write for Doctor Who

532
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
features two of

533
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
the best and worst things

534
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
of his writing that I singled out

535
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
in a video I made that got really popular

536
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
shoehorned into each other.

537
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Like, is he calling me out?

538
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Has he seen

539
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
the video?

540
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Are you watching this now, Stephen?

541
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Or did he really think everyone was dying

542
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
to see what happened to Rusty the Dalek?

543
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
I hope you all recognize the

544
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
importance of the Dalek being called Rusty

545
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
by the way. It's a name from the Moffat

546
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
school of clever references.

547
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
It's a reference to the previous

548
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
showrunner, Russ T.

549
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Davies. Rusty...

550
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
The Doctor spent that episode

551
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
inside the Dalek, trying to save

552
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
it from within. It's a clumsy

553
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
metaphor for how Moffat saw his own

554
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
input on the early series. He was running

555
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
around loose inside Rusty's machine,

556
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
making little adjustments and making

557
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
it better than it was, impacting it

558
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
in some grand way. Bringing Rusty back

559
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
here is Moffat's way of tipping his

560
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
hat to the previous showrunner.

561
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
It's a pity it takes up a huge chunk of an episode

562
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
in desperate need of any actual

563
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
stakes or plot.

564
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh. It's not an evil plan.

565
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Imagine sitting in front

566
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
of your computer

567
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
with the script for your final Doctor Who

568
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
episode, and looking at a

569
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
screen where you have physically

570
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
typed the words

571
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Oh

572
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
It's not an evil plan

573
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
This was all pointless.

574
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
That's the place where I would do a rewrite

575
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
or hope that, like, someone would stop

576
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
me. Why didn't anybody stop

577
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
him? And worst of all, this could actually

578
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
have been some kind of neat payoff.

579
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
An actual answer to the questions raised

580
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
in one of the earliest Capaldi

581
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
episodes. Like, has the Doctor

582
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
changed as a person in the almost three

583
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
full seasons since these characters met?

584
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Has the Dalek changed?

585
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
How is their relationship going

586
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
to develop? This could be a genuinely

587
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
good bookend on this era of the Doctor

588
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
that I didn't even see coming.

589
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Like, maybe something Moffat set

590
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
up really did actually pay

591
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
off satisfyingly in a clever way, with

592
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
this Dalek coming back, and we see how much they've all

593
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
changed. But time gets stopped

594
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
mid-conversation when he figures

595
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
out who Testimony is, and

596
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
the Dalek never gets to

597
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
finish the conversation, and we just

598
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
sort of leave. You know, for maybe

599
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
like 30 seconds, I actually

600
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
believed that Moffat had

601
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
set up an arc for the Doctor

602
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
that was going to conclude here, and we're gonna

603
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
see all the ways he's changed

604
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
by how he deals now with this Dalek,

605
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
and what conversation are they gonna have?

606
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
But then it just

607
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
stops.

608
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
It just doesn't.

609
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I can't believe I let Moffat trick

610
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
me into thinking he was going to do something

611
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
smart, even for a minute.

612
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
I half-expected

613
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Rusty to actually be an imaginary

614
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
invention by the Doctor's sister

615
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
to help remind him of the best

616
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
friends she killed, and who he remembers

617
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
as a dog. No, just kidding.

618
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
That would be far too stupid, wouldn't it?

619
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
God, even Testimony and the dead people

620
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
database thing is a reused idea

621
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
from a previous Moffat episode.

622
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
The last two episodes of season eight

623
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
dealt with a database of the minds

624
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
of a bunch of people who died and been

625
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
downloaded into it, and they thought they lived in an

626
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
afterlife, and fucking hell, when that

627
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
episode first came out, I thought that idea

628
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
was trite and had been done before by

629
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Moffat. It was a clear ripoff of

630
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead,

631
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
two more episodes he wrote featuring

632
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
a giant library that saves the minds

633
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
and memories of dead people.

634
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
The longer his run goes on,

635
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
the more clear it becomes that

636
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Moffat had about four really

637
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
good ideas, and

638
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
kept going back to them over and over.

639
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
["SILENCE IN THE LIBRARY"]

640
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
["SILENCE IN THE LIBRARY"]

641
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
["SILENCE IN THE LIBRARY"]

642
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
So his finale's a wash, along with the

643
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
rest of his run on the show, but at the very least,

644
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
it's over, and luckily,

645
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
since Doctor Who is basically uncancellable,

646
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
it can weather his

647
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
oncoming storm.

648
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Did you get it? That was a needless reference.

649
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
I'm very clever. And make it through to the

650
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
other side and still have a chance

651
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
of being good next time.

652
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
That's kind of always been the beauty of

653
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
old DW. You can have a bad episode

654
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
and then go somewhere else next time

655
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
and do something different and try again.

656
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
I think it's kind of fantastic that

657
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
we have Doctor Who, this huge,

658
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
long-running cultural institution.

659
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
It's just lovely.

660
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
So I think it's good to be optimistic about the

661
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
future of the show.

662
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Hopefully. Hopefully.

663
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Everyone's excited. As excited as I am.

664
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
I really like Jodie Whittaker as an actress,

665
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
although, to be honest, I've loved almost all of the actors

666
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
in Doctor Who. The acting hasn't really been

667
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
the problem since they got rid of that guy

668
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
with the rubbish hair people keep claiming is me

669
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
in the comments of YouTube videos with him in them.

670
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
I have some, shall we say,

671
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
mixed opinions

672
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
about Chris Chibnall, the

673
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,080
showrunner who's taking over from Moffat.

674
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
He's written some pretty good stuff for Doctor Who before

675
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
and also he was the showrunner on

676
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Torchwood, which is a shame,

677
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
but he also recently created

678
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
and wrote most of Broadchurch, which

679
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Whittaker appeared in heavily, and which also

680
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
starred David Tennant, which is either

681
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
definitive proof that the British

682
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
television industry is a small room

683
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
with twelve people in it working on five shows

684
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
between them, or reassuring

685
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
since the lead writer probably

686
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
has a good grasp of his new lead's strengths.

687
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
It's also a really good sign

688
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
that Chibnall is credited as

689
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
the Broadchurch guy in pieces talking

690
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
about him taking over. Broadchurch was

691
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
really well-received in places and he's

692
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
been able to step out of the shadow of Doctor

693
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Who and develop himself as a writer

694
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
over the years. It's nice that they're

695
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
not just promoting in some guy who

696
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
might have written a few good episodes once

697
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
but is untested as a lead writer.

698
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Instead, they're bringing in someone with experience

699
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
running a pretty well-received show for

700
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
three series. It's also probably really nice

701
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
for Chibnall's career that he's not remembered

702
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
as the Torchwood guy because

703
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
I think we all want to forget the

704
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Cyberwoman episode he wrote

705
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
where she's sexy and all

706
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
decked out in rubber.

707
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
So, you know, overall, I'm positive about

708
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
the new lead writer. He's

709
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
proven he...

710
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I mean, there's a chance he

711
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
could...

712
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
The vice president of BBC Worldwide

713
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
says it's one of her favorite episodes of

714
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Torchwood's

715
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
first series

716
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
and that's a really high watermark for

717
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
quality. I mean,

718
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
in terms of LGBT

719
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
representation, Torchwood

720
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
is, on the whole, vastly superior

721
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
to the main Doctor Who series.

722
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Lots of

723
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
ideas just tucked away in a document in case

724
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
I don't know what to write.

725
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Oh, that explains it!

726
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
Chibnall is the one credited

727
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
with the decision to have a female

728
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
doctor so his gender politics

729
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
can't be completely...

730
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
They beat the Cyberwoman

731
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
by spraying her with delicious

732
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
sauce.

733
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
So a pterodactyl eats it!

734
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Oh, it's gonna be

735
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
rubbish, isn't it?

736
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
...

737
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
...

738
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
...

739
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
...

740
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
...

741
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
...
