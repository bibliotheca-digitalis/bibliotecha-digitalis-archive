0	13300	It's election season! You know what that means! It's time for all the worthless fucking ideologues
13300	17300	of the world to take time out of complaining that Magic the Gathering feminists are gonna
17300	22060	steal their anime titties and pretend that they know anything about politics!
22060	29220	But wait a minute! According to people who definitely aren't Nazis and just happen
29220	33220	to have Iron Cross avatars, I'm also just a worthless ideologue!
33220	36220	Well that's great! That means I can get in on the action!
39220	44500	Lock your doors, activate your ray shield, settle in round the blessed computer monitor,
44500	50220	and crack open a boy with your cold ones! It's time for Election Watch 2017!
54220	58140	There's a bird in the rafters and I don't know how to get it out because it's scared
58140	59140	of me, so it just goes away.
63140	68420	How the hecking frig did we get here? Well, our story begins in 2015 when David
68420	72540	Cameron, amidst hemorrhaging votes to further right parties calling to leave the EU and
72540	76700	his own parties infighting about whether they wanted to remain or not, decided to defer
76700	80620	this problem by pledging that if elected, he would hold a referendum on Britain's
80620	87020	EU membership. After losing this election to Cameron despite living up to his party's
87020	91100	principles of not having any anymore, Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader, triggering
91100	95240	a leadership election. Among the folks running for leader was Jeremy Corbyn, on a platform
95240	100920	of anti-austerity and anti-being-almost-exactly-like-the-Tories. To run for leader you need nominations from
100920	106140	other MPs and, for a joke, several MPs nominated him certain he wouldn't actually win. Unfortunately
106140	110080	for them it turns out that Labour's membership weren't in on the joke because the completely
110080	115340	unelectable Corbyn was elected to the party leadership with the largest majority ever,
115340	116940	even more than Tony Blair.
116940	120700	Then the Brexit referendum came. Cameron's strategy of hoping the Conservatives would
120700	125020	figure out their stance on Brexit before the referendum failed, with half his MPs going
125020	129040	out in a giant bus with a lie on it to talk about how much cake we export to France and
129040	133360	tell us about how the money birds will leave the EU with us and come back to build hospitals
133360	138180	with magic, and the other half defending remaining on the admittedly shaky ground that it's
138180	143180	a good idea and better for everyone. MPs on the Remain side included David Cameron, George
143180	147940	Osborne, Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May, who fucking loved being in the
147940	148940	European Union.
148940	154340	And when I put all that together, when I think about the potential risk to jobs, the uncertainties
154340	159100	for our economy if we were to leave, I do believe we are more secure in the EU.
159100	161540	Keep an eye on her. I have a feeling she'll come up later.
161540	165420	Labour was far less divided on Brexit, campaigning on the unified principles of remaining being
165420	169860	good and trying to sabotage Corbyn's leadership and their own party along with it. Now, strangely
169860	174660	enough, amidst the ruling party having no idea which was the better option and the opposition
174660	178820	being too busy trying to kill itself, the Remain message got somewhat muddled and the
178820	182620	referendum ended narrowly in favour of Britain leaving the European Union.
182620	186100	Victorious, having finally gotten what he wanted and realising the time had come to
186100	190740	settle in and get some actual work done, sorting things out and negotiating exactly how we
190740	194460	leave, core leave campaigner Nigel Farage moved to America.
194460	199140	Not that I'm criticising him. I think Farage has a point here. Who'd want to live in Britain?
199140	201660	After all, we're leaving the European Union.
201660	205740	Managing Brexit, we had David Cameron, who drooled out resigning if the referendum didn't
205740	209580	go his way and, like Tories are known to do, committed to keeping his promises.
209580	213660	In a way, there's a link to the decision to resign as Prime Minister. The country made
213660	218820	a decision, a decision I advised against, but nonetheless, the decision's been made.
218820	223100	I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and to get it right.
223100	227900	Great, another leadership election. Luckily, since all the major pro-Brexit MPs had realised
227900	231820	they didn't actually want to have to deal with this shit and fade it into the background,
231820	236260	pro-Remain MP Theresa May won in a short landslide, in prime position to negotiate doing what
236260	239180	she'd said just a few months prior would be a horrible mistake.
239180	243060	Meanwhile, in Labour's camp, Labour ministers deliberated and, after losing a referendum
243060	246620	because they were too busy trying to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn, concluded that the problem
246620	249060	was Jeremy Corbyn and tried to get rid of him.
249060	253900	I think Jeremy's position is now untenable and being the decent man that he is, I hope
253900	256660	he will recognise that and step down.
256660	260620	That way, they could get back to fulfilling Labour's destiny of being completely ineffective.
260620	264980	In her resignation letter, former Shadow First Secretary of State Angela Eagle wrote to Corbyn,
272980	276180	That's right, according to Eagle, Corbyn simply hadn't campaigned hard enough and
276180	277940	that's what cost them the referendum.
277940	281420	Unfortunately for her, many within Labour thought Corbyn had campaigned harder than
281420	285420	anyone else and simply hadn't had any representation because the media were too busy reporting
285420	287140	the Conservative infighting.
287140	288140	One minister even wrote,
297660	300180	Strong, inspiring words from that MP.
300180	301700	Uh, what was their name again?
301700	303260	Oh yeah, Angela Eagle.
303260	304260	Wait, hold on a second.
304260	308660	After a mass resignation, calls for Corbyn himself to resign and a vote of no confidence,
308660	311420	Labour had its second leadership election in a year.
311420	315860	True to her confusing and contradictory words, Angela Eagle proved how unelectable Corbyn
315860	320020	was by running against him and then dropping out after eight days, but soon MPs figured
320020	323380	out that they were sure they'd found the electable candidate, falling in line behind
323380	329260	Owen Smith and, ready to get back to business, Smith spectacularly lost to Jeremy Corbyn,
329260	333460	who won with an even larger percentage of the vote than he did last time, making him
333460	337980	the most elected leader of Labour again, even more this time.
337980	343180	It seems that Labour is definitively stuck with the unelectable weirdo that no-one wants,
343180	346820	simply down to the fact that people want him there.
346820	348820	Democracy's really confusing sometimes.
348820	352700	Anyway, now that both parties had their leadership sorted out, we could finally get down to the
352700	358020	brass tacks of actually negotiating Brexit, but then it turned out that no-one knows what
358020	359020	Brexit means.
359020	361580	Brexit means Brexit.
361580	364300	Yeah, alright, yeah, okay.
364300	366820	People talk about the sort of Brexit that there is going to be.
366820	367820	Is it hard, soft?
367820	368820	Is it grey, white?
368820	371820	Actually, we want a red, white and blue Brexit.
371820	375020	That is the right Brexit for the United Kingdom.
375020	376940	Red, white and blue Brexit?
376940	377940	So three Brexits?
377940	382820	Or do all three cumulatively mean one Brexit singularly?
382820	385140	I'm glad we have the daughter of a vicar working all this out.
385140	389540	She'll be great at answering questions of consubstantiation.
389540	395020	May was finally in prime position to handle these difficult negotiations out of the union
395020	399380	she didn't want to leave, and luckily she could focus all of her time and effort onto
399380	402060	it because she had ruled out a snap election.
402060	405580	And like Tories are known to do, she committed to keeping her promises.
405580	407860	The government should call a general election.
407860	410460	Oh, wait, I meant the opposite of that.
410460	414560	So here we are now attempting to negotiate one of the most important diplomatic deals
414560	418260	in the history of our country, and being made to choose between a man who didn't want to
418260	422020	leave but at least his party membership wanted him in charge, and a woman who didn't want
422020	425940	to leave but whose party membership aren't even allowed to vote on who gets to be leader.
425940	430060	For the pro-Brexit lot, it's a bit like having to choose between a rock and a hard place
430060	431700	with a dementia tax.
431700	436860	But don't worry, I'm certain the electorate will continue to make the shittest possible choice.
436860	438940	Part two, media bias.
438940	440500	But enough about how we got here.
440500	442780	What about how the media talks about all of this?
442780	445180	Let's look at how they talk about Jeremy Corbyn for a little bit.
445180	449940	Many Labour MPs were certain he was unelectable, and the totally unbiased media made sure you
449940	453600	knew those opinions ahead of even knowing why he was unelectable.
453600	456980	But a couple of people think you wouldn't want to elect him, and it's imperative that
456980	460420	you know they think that, over and over, forever.
460420	464860	For a time, the early stories about the Corbster resembled an angry text algorithm generating
464860	470000	random complaints based on the angle of his bow, or offhand comments about how world peace
470000	471060	would be nice.
471060	480460	It was almost as if Corbyn's actually left-wing policies, uh, threatened huge companies like
480460	486260	News Corp, and they felt the need to smear him in order to try and destroy him.
486260	487260	I mean, almost.
487260	489420	I mean, a little bit, maybe.
489420	497220	National anthem, outrage, Corb snubs the Queen, court jester, we put a hat on him so you know
497220	498460	he's bad.
498460	502940	The new Labour leader treated himself to a black cab at his home yesterday, abandoning
502940	508580	the Chairman Mao-style bicycle his neighbours always see him riding.
508580	509580	What?
509580	512540	What's Mao-y about it, exactly?
512540	514540	Like, what?
514540	521580	I revealed how Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the prospect of an asteroid wiping out humanity.
521580	524260	He has also called for the legalisation the...
524260	525260	Um.
525260	528780	He has also called for the legalisation of the possession of cannabis.
528780	532580	Wait, hang on, I thought you didn't want us to elect him.
532580	536540	Labour in meltdown, Corbyn, abolish the army.
536540	540300	New leader's potty plan for world peace.
540300	543020	Free rugby attacks cards.
543020	545120	Did I wake in a foreign country?
545120	549220	This is what happens when you elect a vegetarian to lead a pub.
549220	550220	What?
550220	551860	What does that have to do with anything?
551860	553740	I retire from the army in six months.
553740	555100	He can knock himself out.
555100	558020	Good lad, he'll be gone from his job before you are yours.
558020	565980	They're so mad, they even recycled some old propaganda they used with the last Labour
565980	566980	leader.
566980	571180	It got so bad that at one point, the Mail on Sunday ran a hit piece with the title,
571180	578620	Labour must kill vampire Jezza, only ten days after the actual brutal murder of Labour MP
578620	579980	Joe Cox.
579980	584500	Luckily, someone eventually realised that this was something of a bad look, and the
584500	587620	online version changed its title slightly.
587620	592820	Corbyn signals sky-high immigration would continue under Labour.
592820	593820	Continue from who?
593820	594820	From who?
594820	596780	Who's in charge here?
596780	602500	And let's not forget this piece of speculative fiction the Mail on Sunday actually printed
602500	605140	about a prospective Jeremy Corbyn leadership.
605140	610300	Prime Minister Corbyn and the thousand days that destroyed Britain as this brilliant imagining
610300	616300	of a Corbyn premiership, fuck you, reveals Tories who gloat over Labour's woe should
616300	618220	be careful what they wish for.
618220	622340	The night sky over London was thick with choking black smog.
622340	626380	By the way, Theresa May abolished the Climate Council.
626380	629220	You might want to retract that bit.
629220	633460	Not for him, the Prime Minister's Jaguar in which his hated Mrs Thatcher had departed
633460	635820	on the night she too was deposed.
635820	640940	All government cars had long since been sold in a desperate bid to pay off the three trillion
640940	642420	national debt.
642420	648700	Corbyn's chief of staff, Owen Jones, declared that the people had taken back their country.
648700	651860	The red flag was hung from the windows of number 10.
651860	657260	Russell Brand kept his garbled verbosity in check for once and simply tweeted,
657260	658260	YES!
658260	663460	Meanwhile, the media reporting the growing opposition to the government and the whispers
663460	667500	of a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons were accused of treachery.
667500	671020	The far-left had always believed that their inability to win elections was due to the
671020	675620	machinations of right-wing press barons who poisoned the people's minds against—
675620	678420	how can you not realize that you are doing that?
678420	684100	You're literally publishing fan fiction in which Jeremy Corbyn destroys Britain.
684100	685740	What the fuck?
685740	689980	Ironically, it was Corbyn's better nature that finally defeated him.
689980	694740	He lacked the Stalinist zeal to force the people into submission.
694740	699020	British Airways reported ticket sales on first-class flights out of London,
699020	701260	and none at all coming back.
701260	704980	One Direction went off on a U.S. tour and never returned.
704980	707060	Okay, this is actually starting to sound pretty good now.
707060	715140	Now, you might be inclined to say that a media willing to publish 2,600 words of fan fiction
715180	717580	about how Jeremy Corbyn destroyed Britain
717580	721180	could be a little bit biased against Corbyn and his politics,
721180	725340	and perhaps distorting his views somewhat.
725340	726700	You know, maybe a little bit.
726700	729380	But let's be fair. Media bias?
729380	731700	Where's your proof that's happening, you ask?
731700	735940	And you're right. Ignoring the wealth of evidence I've just provided for a second,
735940	739980	I don't have any proof that the media is misrepresenting Corbyn and his views.
739980	747060	All I have is eyes that read newspapers, a functioning brain, and, uh...
747060	750140	Oh, yeah, a study by the London School of Economics
750140	754660	showing that around 75% of press coverage of Corbyn and his views misrepresented him,
754660	759260	and only 11% of the total coverage didn't distort any of his views whatsoever,
759260	763540	with the Daily Express and Daily Mail failing to provide any such coverage at all.
763540	767540	Jeremy Corbyn is completely unelectable. Nobody likes him.
767540	770540	And we know this, said the media, because we keep lying about him.
770540	774700	But, eventually, the media started to find things they could smear him about
774700	776620	because they might actually be true.
776620	781180	For example, many have accused Corbyn of being soft on terrorism and the IRA.
781180	784300	Did you appear in a picture with the bad people, Jeremy?
784300	786980	Are you friends with the bad people, Jeremy?
786980	789780	Did you personally bomb the pub, Jeremy,
789780	792540	before riding off in your Mao-esque bicycle
792540	795900	or in your Stalin-adjacent weather balloon?
795940	798700	We here in my shed can bring you a special report
798700	802540	detailing all of Corbyn's shady dealings with the IRA.
802540	807420	During the 1980s, Corbyn spoke openly with both Irish Republicans and Ulster Loyalists
807420	810740	in an attempt to bring about a peaceful resolution to the Irish conflict.
810740	814060	During this period of openness, Margaret Thatcher was giving long speeches
814060	816700	explaining that it was wrong to negotiate with terrorists,
816700	819380	which it later turned out, from declassified documents,
819380	821940	she literally was doing in secret.
821980	824620	In 1994, Corbyn signed a parliamentary motion
824620	827540	on the 20th anniversary of the IRA pub bombing in Birmingham,
827540	830220	a motion which called the attack a terrorist atrocity.
830220	834300	In 1995, Corbyn met with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin,
834300	836460	the political wing of the Irish Republican movement,
836460	839500	which you'll be shocked to discover are not a terrorist group
839500	842220	unless people wanting to control their country terrifies you,
842220	844220	in which case I hope you didn't vote Brexit.
844220	846700	This happened either during or after the declaration
846700	849260	that the Northern Irish had the right to self-determination,
849260	851380	an event which led to the IRA ceasefire
851380	854660	and quite directly to the disbanding of the organisation entirely.
854660	858620	In 2013, Corbyn received the Gandhi Foundation International Peace Award
858620	861060	for, among hard opposition to pointless wars,
861060	864340	helping to bring a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.
864340	865500	And that's it.
865500	870500	Clearly, a man known to be flip-flopping on whether or not he likes the IRA.
870500	873340	I can see how many Conservative ministers might be confused
873340	875020	as to what side Corbyn was on.
875020	877500	After all, it was a very confusing time for them.
877500	880420	Their Prime Minister was secretly negotiating with the IRA
880420	883860	while condemning the idea of negotiating with the IRA.
883860	886100	I can see how it might have been difficult for them to fathom
886100	888820	that there was a way of finding peace that didn't require lies,
888820	891500	smear tactics, and backchannels with terrorism.
891500	895660	Maybe they're criticising Corbyn for not talking to the IRA in secret like they were,
895660	899660	but none of this stopped the media from parading around the same couple of pictures again.
899660	902180	It's important to guilt people by association.
902180	905700	If you've met someone, you're guilty of all of their crimes,
905700	907700	even ones they've never actually committed.
907700	910300	Here's Corbyn with Sinn Féin President Jerry Adams.
910300	912940	Here's Corbyn with Sinn Féin President Jerry Adams.
912940	915300	Here's Prince Charles with Sinn Féin President Jerry A-
915300	916700	Oh, dear, how did that get there?
916700	920140	Here's Vampire Jezza having coffee with Martin McGuinness.
920140	923140	Here's Corbyn hanging out with Martin McGuinness.
923140	925140	And here's the Queen shaking hands with Martin McGuin-
925140	926420	Wait, no, cut! Rewind the-
926420	929260	Part three, will you kill millions, Jeremy?
929260	932580	One other thing the media and opposition have managed to hammer Corbyn on
932580	934340	is his stance on nuclear war.
934380	938300	Corbyn thinks it's bad and should be avoided at all costs, the monster.
938300	942140	We find it incredibly concerning that you-you wouldn't ever commit-commit to doing that.
942140	944980	It's our safety that we need to look out first and foremost in your government.
944980	948100	Jeremy has trouble giving a satisfying answer to that question.
948500	951700	You see, everyone expected him to immediately begin fantasizing
951700	954380	about the deaths he'd be willing to cause if he was pushed to it
954380	958620	and imagine a situation where he would have to push it so he could simply say yes or no,
958620	961500	but instead he went into this long, thoughtful piece
961500	966300	where he elaborated upon how even getting to that situation would put the world at tremendous risk
966300	968860	and the real solution is how you avoid doing that,
968860	971580	but that he would obviously pursue it as a second-use policy.
971580	974100	Naturally, people weren't happy with THAT kind of answer.
974100	978660	Would you allow North Korea or some idiot in Iran to bomb us?
978660	979660	You'd be too late!
979660	980660	No, of course not.
980660	981940	You're gonna have to do it first, mate!
981940	982380	No, of-
982380	983980	Will you kill millions, Jeremy?
983980	985780	Will you kill millions, Jeremy?
985780	987420	Jeremy, will you kill millions?
987420	989260	You see, I'd love to vote for you, Jeremy,
989260	993460	but as a Tory voter, I have this unquenchable thirst for blood
993460	999460	that can only be satiated with the most powerful weapon ever conceived by mankind!
999460	1002420	The old adage is speak softly and carry a big stick,
1002420	1005740	not threaten everyone else who has a stick with your stick
1005740	1008380	and then wonder why everyone else has started hitting you.
1008380	1011380	If you position yourself as ready at any moment to hit the button,
1011380	1013100	your enemies prepare to hit theirs,
1013100	1017660	and that's not a great situation for the, you know, planet that we live on.
1017700	1020220	First use isn't a self-defense mechanism.
1020220	1022220	It's a self-destruct mechanism.
1022220	1025900	There is no situation where a first use will be the only use
1025900	1028660	because the second use will be to kill us back.
1028660	1031980	The times in history humanity has come the closest to nuclear war
1031980	1036180	have been caused by one side becoming convinced the other fully intended to
1036180	1038740	and was just about to launch their own weapons.
1038740	1042900	An active strategy of de-escalation doesn't sound very jingoistic or protective,
1042900	1044700	but it's literally the best option,
1044700	1048020	and fantasizing about how your enemies are constantly waiting to use theirs
1048020	1052140	the instant they smell weakness literally directly prolongs the problem.
1052140	1056020	Luckily, it's unlikely either of these gentlemen will ever get their hands on the
1056020	1057580	Kill Everyone Death button,
1057580	1060340	although, thanks to a recent investigation for election fraud,
1060340	1062580	I hear there might be an opening coming up in South Thanet.
1062580	1066220	Just before, I don't understand why everyone in this room seems so keen on...
1066980	1068980	killing millions of people with a nuclear bomb.
1068980	1070980	Woo!
1070980	1073140	Part four, the policy problem.
1073140	1076500	But enough about the bikes Corbyn stole from history's greatest monsters
1076500	1079220	and how despicable it is that he won't nuke people.
1079220	1081660	What about both parties' actual policies?
1081660	1085500	Labour have a 128-page manifesto detailing all their ideas,
1085500	1087660	such as reducing class sizes in schools,
1087660	1089060	investing in infrastructure,
1089060	1092500	over $30 billion in funding for the NHS over the next parliament,
1092500	1094660	and free school meals for every child.
1094660	1096980	But where's the money for that gonna come from, Jezza?
1096980	1098540	There's no magic money tree.
1098540	1101020	And we have to stop thinking, as you do,
1101020	1102620	that there's a magic money tree.
1102620	1107020	I mean, he has this money tree wish list in his manifesto.
1107020	1111820	And I'm being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the NHS.
1111820	1112420	Wait, no, don't say that.
1112420	1114500	But there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake
1114500	1117140	that suddenly provides for everything that people want.
1117140	1119220	Teresa, someone's already used that one-liner.
1119220	1121300	You probably should have watched the fucking debate, shouldn't you?
1121300	1122580	Where's all the money gonna come from?
1122580	1123300	Oh, wait.
1123300	1124900	The manifesto is fully costed,
1124900	1127900	explaining how much every policy will cost in estimation,
1127940	1129540	and how the money will be raised.
1129540	1131420	For example, those free school meals I mentioned
1131420	1133740	are estimated to cost £0.9 billion,
1133740	1136980	and this cost will be covered by removing VAT exemption on private school fees,
1136980	1139660	making the country around £1.2 billion,
1139660	1143740	which actually puts the country further into the black than most austerity policies.
1143740	1145660	So what about the Conservatives' books?
1145660	1147740	Where does the money come from for their ideas?
1147740	1149100	Well, nobody knows,
1149100	1152580	because their smaller 88-page manifesto isn't costed.
1152580	1155260	It's very easy to think about how you spend money.
1155260	1157860	It's much harder to think about how you raise money.
1158020	1159380	Yeah, it is pretty hard, isn't it?
1159380	1161620	That's probably why the Conservatives didn't bother to check
1161620	1163700	how much money their ideas would cost.
1163700	1167100	Luckily, former Chancellor Ken Clarke came to the Tories' rescue
1167100	1169580	by saying manifestos shouldn't be costed
1169580	1171740	because then the Chancellor can be flexible.
1171740	1175340	If you make no falsifiable promises and don't tell anyone anything specific,
1175340	1177540	then you can't be accused of not doing anything,
1177540	1178580	like he used to.
1178580	1179540	Vote Tory.
1179540	1180900	We'll balance the books,
1180900	1182900	although we don't know what's in them exactly.
1182900	1184380	You're just gonna have to trust us.
1184380	1186340	I'm gonna turn to, um, Amber Rod.
1186340	1189100	Uh, the question is about trusting plans,
1189100	1192100	and in your manifesto, there was a notable absence of costings.
1192100	1194340	Well, I would say in answer to that question,
1194340	1195900	judge us on our record.
1195900	1197740	On our record, we have cut costs.
1197740	1199220	We will cut costs.
1199220	1200620	All right, Amber, I get it.
1200620	1201860	There's no magic money tree.
1201860	1204620	All right, what about the actual fucking trees?
1204620	1208460	There's also the problem of what critics are calling the dementia tax.
1208460	1211380	The manifesto lays out that the elderly must pay for their own care
1211380	1214460	if they have savings and property worth more than £100,000.
1214460	1216020	In other words, if they own a house,
1216020	1218340	they'll probably have to sell it to pay for the care they'll need,
1218340	1221460	although if they don't want to lose their home for some reason,
1221460	1223940	the payment can be deferred until after they die.
1223940	1225100	How generous.
1225100	1227260	Taxes like this ask important questions,
1227260	1230540	such as part five, are the Tories trying to throw the election?
1230540	1233380	Are they trying to lose so that when Labour or someone else
1233380	1235460	inevitably don't get a great deal out of Brexit
1235460	1237300	because Brexit was a bad idea,
1237300	1239140	they can then spin it as their mistake?
1239140	1241580	Or are they just so sure they're going to win
1241580	1243260	that they don't even think they have to bother
1243260	1244860	hiding their true ideas?
1244860	1246500	Now, you might have expected Theresa May
1246500	1249420	to defend her party's policies at the leaders' debate,
1249420	1251900	but she didn't bother going to the leaders' debate.
1251900	1254020	She instead sent Home Secretary Amber Rudd,
1254020	1256180	seen before making the money tree comments.
1256180	1258540	A little odd, traditionally, for the Prime Minister
1258540	1261660	who thought it was an easy win to hide from being scrutinised.
1262260	1264580	Well, I'm interested, you know, in the fact that Jeremy Corbyn
1264580	1266220	seems to be paying far more attention
1266220	1268580	to how many appearances on telly he's doing.
1268580	1269980	I think he ought to be paying a little more attention
1269980	1271660	to thinking about Brexit negotiations.
1271660	1274660	That's what I'm doing to make sure we get the best possible deal for Britain.
1274860	1277340	Yes, I also wouldn't let myself be distracted
1277340	1280700	from Brexit negotiations by having to go to a debate
1280700	1284020	or by, for example, calling an election.
1284020	1286220	Must be distracting, Theresa, mustn't it?
1286220	1288500	That election that you called.
1288500	1290580	Remember, the one you said you wouldn't?
1290580	1294260	This level of incompetence is so exquisite
1294260	1296620	that it almost has to have been managed.
1296620	1297820	Hold on a second, Theresa.
1297820	1300340	I really don't want to belabor, ha, this point,
1300340	1302420	but the leaflet that got sent through my door
1302420	1306100	says strong, stable leadership in the national interest.
1306100	1307220	What leadership?
1307220	1308820	You didn't turn up to the fucking debate
1308820	1311380	and you won't tell us who's gonna be in your cabinet now!
1311380	1313220	There's been an increase in the Tories complaining
1313220	1315300	about how the media are biased against them.
1315300	1318300	For example, claiming the BBC used a purposefully biased audience
1318300	1319860	against them in the leaders' debate,
1319860	1322940	as if it is somehow possible to find an audience neutral
1322940	1325540	on a party not being bothered to send their leader
1325540	1328700	to the leader debate in an election they called.
1328700	1331100	And to be fair, I am also myself a little bit biased.
1331100	1334260	As a socialist, I'm biased in favor of peace,
1334260	1338740	justice, humanity, health care, uh, facts,
1338740	1339740	and the truth.
1339740	1341140	The Big Six, we call them.
1341140	1342660	Trying to do their side a favor,
1342660	1345380	the Sun attempted to spin the Tories' policies
1345380	1346780	as good for millennials.
1346780	1348860	For example, how awful would it be
1348860	1350780	if labor ended tuition fees?
1350780	1353460	This would surely benefit richer families more.
1353460	1355260	Poorer students would be left out in the dirt
1355260	1358020	without even the warmth of debt for comfort.
1358020	1360420	And taxes will be lighter on millennials under the Tories
1360420	1362340	because they're shifting so much of the burden
1362340	1363460	onto the elderly.
1363460	1366780	Wow, the sun's finally coming up on Tory Britain now, isn't it?
1366780	1367860	And now they're even saying,
1367860	1369460	make Britain great again,
1369460	1370980	something you'd think they'd have done
1370980	1373540	in the past seven years they've had in government.
1373540	1377300	But no, this time we promise cutting more stuff will work,
1377300	1380500	but just don't ask us how much stuff we're cutting.
1380500	1382300	This is the kind of strategy I would adopt
1382300	1384460	if I wanted to lose the election on purpose,
1384460	1386300	and I hope they are because that way
1386300	1388820	they're at least looking evil intentionally,
1388820	1390780	and that's not even getting into the arms dealing
1390780	1391820	with Saudi Arabia,
1391820	1393820	which we should probably go into a bit, shouldn't we?
1393820	1395580	Well, here's Nicholas Wilson,
1395580	1397260	a campaigner for anti-corruption,
1397260	1399300	trying to do just that on the 3rd of June.
1399300	1402780	And she was in Saudi Arabia in April of this year
1402780	1405980	selling arms of Saudi Arabia
1405980	1409340	of the country responsible for IS,
1409340	1411060	and they support IS.
1411060	1412860	Oh, who's that over there
1412860	1415460	surreptitiously handing a piece of paper to the chairman?
1415460	1417580	That's Amber Rudd, the current Home Secretary,
1417580	1419420	and Theresa May's star debater.
1419420	1423340	We supply arms to Saudi Arabia
1423340	1425140	through...
1425140	1427980	Which is the personality trait I wish to avoid?
1427980	1432260	Why? I'm sorry. Come on.
1432260	1433260	Come on.
1433260	1434980	This is censorship.
1434980	1437900	That's certainly one way of holding a debate.
1437900	1440940	Now, I don't like being an alarmist sort of person,
1440940	1444820	but honestly, seeing stuff like this happen in Britain
1444820	1447260	is a little bit terrifying,
1447300	1449300	and it leads me to ask the question,
1449300	1452620	what if we're totally fucked?
1452620	1454860	Now, the way the polls are looking,
1454860	1456420	it seems like the Conservative Party
1456420	1457860	are going to get the most votes,
1457860	1460220	which, unfortunately, in our system,
1460220	1461460	means they'll win.
1461460	1463100	♪
1463100	1464820	We're gonna find out together
1464820	1467060	the real cost of the dementia tax,
1467060	1468740	of slashing budgets,
1468740	1472740	of their bizarre opinions about cybersecurity
1472740	1474380	and how, basically, you shouldn't be allowed
1474380	1475380	to have any privacy.
1475420	1477500	We're gonna find out what that really means
1477500	1479180	together over the next four years,
1479180	1480820	barring some miracle.
1480820	1482380	I became disillusioned with politics
1482380	1484460	on the 5th of May, 2011,
1484460	1487540	when the referendum on alternative votes
1487540	1489540	decided that, no, you shouldn't be allowed
1489540	1491980	to have a preference on who you would want to win
1491980	1495060	if the party you actually like doesn't have enough votes,
1495060	1497460	which effectively dooms the British left
1497460	1499980	to dividing their vote 18 ways,
1499980	1502100	whereas the right are very good at falling in line
1502100	1504780	and only really hemorrhage their vote, like, three ways.
1504860	1507460	Labour, the Lib Dems, the SMP, Plaid Cymru,
1507460	1508540	the Green Party.
1508540	1512740	Cumulatively, people in Britain favor left-wing ideas.
1512740	1515500	That's almost objectively a fact,
1515500	1517620	but the vote is split so many ways
1517620	1520380	along often quite similar policies
1520380	1524140	that the people don't get to have their vision realized
1524140	1525260	because the right-wing parties
1525260	1526860	always get more votes collectively
1526860	1528380	because there's less of them.
1528380	1530780	The cynical old me would probably say
1530780	1534140	that maybe we've already lost the battle
1534140	1537220	for the soul of our electoral system.
1537220	1538820	In my Brexit video, I talked about
1538820	1541900	how there's this almost inherent flaw,
1541900	1544300	even at the best of times in representative democracy,
1544300	1546460	where you're always at the risk
1546460	1548700	of generating a political elite
1548700	1550460	who do the thinking for everyone else
1550460	1552180	because they're the representatives,
1552180	1554420	thus making people collectively stupider
1554420	1555940	and worse at making these decisions.
1555940	1558420	But in retrospect, I was wrong.
1558420	1562700	I think the real problem is that maybe,
1562700	1564820	even when we know what we want,
1564820	1567100	we lack the ability to properly express
1567100	1568860	within our political system
1568860	1571380	the thing that we want and get it.
1571380	1573100	Maybe the next election
1573100	1574540	is the one where things actually get better
1574540	1576540	and the next five years are a chance to prepare
1576540	1578340	and regroup and really think about
1578340	1579820	what our strategy should be,
1579820	1581100	and that could be excellent.
1589220	1590220	Hello?
1592820	1594220	What? You're kidding?
1594220	1595820	That's impossible. What?
1612820	1614220	They're back.
1614220	1616020	After all this time, they're back.
1618620	1620820	I thought they lied. I thought it was a story.
1622420	1626420	But after these years, after all these long years,
1626420	1628620	the moneybirds are finally home.
1640020	1641420	Hey, folks.
1641420	1644220	The last video got taken down with copyright stuff
1644220	1645820	and I had to re-edit it a little bit.
1645820	1647820	And then when I put it back up,
1647820	1649020	I messed up the credits.
1649020	1650620	Like, half the names were missing.
1650620	1653220	So I've decided to put them here.
1653220	1655220	All the names that I missed, they're here now.
1655220	1656820	I'm really sorry it happened.
1656820	1658220	But by the time I noticed the problem,
1658220	1660620	I was not going to re-edit the video for a third time
1660620	1663020	and like 100,000 people had already seen it.
1663020	1665820	So thank you to all of these people for being patient
1665820	1667020	and waiting for their names to come up in the credits.
1667020	1669220	Thank you very much for helping fund
1669220	1671620	whatever the hell it is that I'm doing here.
1671620	1672420	I'm really out of breath.
1672420	1674020	I've been shouting about the moneybirds outside
