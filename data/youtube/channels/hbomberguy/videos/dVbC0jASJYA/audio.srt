1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,300
It's election season! You know what that means! It's time for all the worthless fucking ideologues

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,300
of the world to take time out of complaining that Magic the Gathering feminists are gonna

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,060
steal their anime titties and pretend that they know anything about politics!

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,220
But wait a minute! According to people who definitely aren't Nazis and just happen

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,220
to have Iron Cross avatars, I'm also just a worthless ideologue!

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,220
Well that's great! That means I can get in on the action!

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,500
Lock your doors, activate your ray shield, settle in round the blessed computer monitor,

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,220
and crack open a boy with your cold ones! It's time for Election Watch 2017!

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,140
There's a bird in the rafters and I don't know how to get it out because it's scared

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
of me, so it just goes away.

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,420
How the hecking frig did we get here? Well, our story begins in 2015 when David

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,540
Cameron, amidst hemorrhaging votes to further right parties calling to leave the EU and

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,700
his own parties infighting about whether they wanted to remain or not, decided to defer

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,620
this problem by pledging that if elected, he would hold a referendum on Britain's

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,020
EU membership. After losing this election to Cameron despite living up to his party's

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,100
principles of not having any anymore, Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader, triggering

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,240
a leadership election. Among the folks running for leader was Jeremy Corbyn, on a platform

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,920
of anti-austerity and anti-being-almost-exactly-like-the-Tories. To run for leader you need nominations from

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,140
other MPs and, for a joke, several MPs nominated him certain he wouldn't actually win. Unfortunately

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,080
for them it turns out that Labour's membership weren't in on the joke because the completely

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,340
unelectable Corbyn was elected to the party leadership with the largest majority ever,

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,940
even more than Tony Blair.

23
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,700
Then the Brexit referendum came. Cameron's strategy of hoping the Conservatives would

24
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,020
figure out their stance on Brexit before the referendum failed, with half his MPs going

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,040
out in a giant bus with a lie on it to talk about how much cake we export to France and

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,360
tell us about how the money birds will leave the EU with us and come back to build hospitals

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,180
with magic, and the other half defending remaining on the admittedly shaky ground that it's

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,180
a good idea and better for everyone. MPs on the Remain side included David Cameron, George

29
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,940
Osborne, Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May, who fucking loved being in the

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
European Union.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,340
And when I put all that together, when I think about the potential risk to jobs, the uncertainties

32
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,100
for our economy if we were to leave, I do believe we are more secure in the EU.

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,540
Keep an eye on her. I have a feeling she'll come up later.

34
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,420
Labour was far less divided on Brexit, campaigning on the unified principles of remaining being

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,860
good and trying to sabotage Corbyn's leadership and their own party along with it. Now, strangely

36
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,660
enough, amidst the ruling party having no idea which was the better option and the opposition

37
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,820
being too busy trying to kill itself, the Remain message got somewhat muddled and the

38
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,620
referendum ended narrowly in favour of Britain leaving the European Union.

39
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,100
Victorious, having finally gotten what he wanted and realising the time had come to

40
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,740
settle in and get some actual work done, sorting things out and negotiating exactly how we

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,460
leave, core leave campaigner Nigel Farage moved to America.

42
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,140
Not that I'm criticising him. I think Farage has a point here. Who'd want to live in Britain?

43
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,660
After all, we're leaving the European Union.

44
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,740
Managing Brexit, we had David Cameron, who drooled out resigning if the referendum didn't

45
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,580
go his way and, like Tories are known to do, committed to keeping his promises.

46
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,660
In a way, there's a link to the decision to resign as Prime Minister. The country made

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,820
a decision, a decision I advised against, but nonetheless, the decision's been made.

48
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,100
I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and to get it right.

49
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,900
Great, another leadership election. Luckily, since all the major pro-Brexit MPs had realised

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,820
they didn't actually want to have to deal with this shit and fade it into the background,

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,260
pro-Remain MP Theresa May won in a short landslide, in prime position to negotiate doing what

52
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,180
she'd said just a few months prior would be a horrible mistake.

53
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,060
Meanwhile, in Labour's camp, Labour ministers deliberated and, after losing a referendum

54
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,620
because they were too busy trying to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn, concluded that the problem

55
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,060
was Jeremy Corbyn and tried to get rid of him.

56
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,900
I think Jeremy's position is now untenable and being the decent man that he is, I hope

57
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,660
he will recognise that and step down.

58
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,620
That way, they could get back to fulfilling Labour's destiny of being completely ineffective.

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,980
In her resignation letter, former Shadow First Secretary of State Angela Eagle wrote to Corbyn,

60
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,180
That's right, according to Eagle, Corbyn simply hadn't campaigned hard enough and

61
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,940
that's what cost them the referendum.

62
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,420
Unfortunately for her, many within Labour thought Corbyn had campaigned harder than

63
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,420
anyone else and simply hadn't had any representation because the media were too busy reporting

64
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,140
the Conservative infighting.

65
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
One minister even wrote,

66
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,180
Strong, inspiring words from that MP.

67
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,700
Uh, what was their name again?

68
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,260
Oh yeah, Angela Eagle.

69
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
Wait, hold on a second.

70
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,660
After a mass resignation, calls for Corbyn himself to resign and a vote of no confidence,

71
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,420
Labour had its second leadership election in a year.

72
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,860
True to her confusing and contradictory words, Angela Eagle proved how unelectable Corbyn

73
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,020
was by running against him and then dropping out after eight days, but soon MPs figured

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,380
out that they were sure they'd found the electable candidate, falling in line behind

75
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,260
Owen Smith and, ready to get back to business, Smith spectacularly lost to Jeremy Corbyn,

76
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,460
who won with an even larger percentage of the vote than he did last time, making him

77
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,980
the most elected leader of Labour again, even more this time.

78
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,180
It seems that Labour is definitively stuck with the unelectable weirdo that no-one wants,

79
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,820
simply down to the fact that people want him there.

80
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Democracy's really confusing sometimes.

81
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,700
Anyway, now that both parties had their leadership sorted out, we could finally get down to the

82
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,020
brass tacks of actually negotiating Brexit, but then it turned out that no-one knows what

83
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
Brexit means.

84
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,580
Brexit means Brexit.

85
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,300
Yeah, alright, yeah, okay.

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,820
People talk about the sort of Brexit that there is going to be.

87
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,820
Is it hard, soft?

88
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Is it grey, white?

89
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Actually, we want a red, white and blue Brexit.

90
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,020
That is the right Brexit for the United Kingdom.

91
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,940
Red, white and blue Brexit?

92
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
So three Brexits?

93
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,820
Or do all three cumulatively mean one Brexit singularly?

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,140
I'm glad we have the daughter of a vicar working all this out.

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,540
She'll be great at answering questions of consubstantiation.

96
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,020
May was finally in prime position to handle these difficult negotiations out of the union

97
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,380
she didn't want to leave, and luckily she could focus all of her time and effort onto

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,060
it because she had ruled out a snap election.

99
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,580
And like Tories are known to do, she committed to keeping her promises.

100
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,860
The government should call a general election.

101
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,460
Oh, wait, I meant the opposite of that.

102
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,560
So here we are now attempting to negotiate one of the most important diplomatic deals

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,260
in the history of our country, and being made to choose between a man who didn't want to

104
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,020
leave but at least his party membership wanted him in charge, and a woman who didn't want

105
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,940
to leave but whose party membership aren't even allowed to vote on who gets to be leader.

106
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,060
For the pro-Brexit lot, it's a bit like having to choose between a rock and a hard place

107
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,700
with a dementia tax.

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,860
But don't worry, I'm certain the electorate will continue to make the shittest possible choice.

109
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,940
Part two, media bias.

110
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,500
But enough about how we got here.

111
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,780
What about how the media talks about all of this?

112
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,180
Let's look at how they talk about Jeremy Corbyn for a little bit.

113
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,940
Many Labour MPs were certain he was unelectable, and the totally unbiased media made sure you

114
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,600
knew those opinions ahead of even knowing why he was unelectable.

115
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,980
But a couple of people think you wouldn't want to elect him, and it's imperative that

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,420
you know they think that, over and over, forever.

117
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,860
For a time, the early stories about the Corbster resembled an angry text algorithm generating

118
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,000
random complaints based on the angle of his bow, or offhand comments about how world peace

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,060
would be nice.

120
00:07:51,060 --> 00:08:00,460
It was almost as if Corbyn's actually left-wing policies, uh, threatened huge companies like

121
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,260
News Corp, and they felt the need to smear him in order to try and destroy him.

122
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,260
I mean, almost.

123
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,420
I mean, a little bit, maybe.

124
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:17,220
National anthem, outrage, Corb snubs the Queen, court jester, we put a hat on him so you know

125
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,460
he's bad.

126
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,940
The new Labour leader treated himself to a black cab at his home yesterday, abandoning

127
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,580
the Chairman Mao-style bicycle his neighbours always see him riding.

128
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
What?

129
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,540
What's Mao-y about it, exactly?

130
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,540
Like, what?

131
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:41,580
I revealed how Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the prospect of an asteroid wiping out humanity.

132
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,260
He has also called for the legalisation the...

133
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Um.

134
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,780
He has also called for the legalisation of the possession of cannabis.

135
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,580
Wait, hang on, I thought you didn't want us to elect him.

136
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,540
Labour in meltdown, Corbyn, abolish the army.

137
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,300
New leader's potty plan for world peace.

138
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,020
Free rugby attacks cards.

139
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,120
Did I wake in a foreign country?

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,220
This is what happens when you elect a vegetarian to lead a pub.

141
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
What?

142
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,860
What does that have to do with anything?

143
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,740
I retire from the army in six months.

144
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,100
He can knock himself out.

145
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,020
Good lad, he'll be gone from his job before you are yours.

146
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,980
They're so mad, they even recycled some old propaganda they used with the last Labour

147
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
leader.

148
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,180
It got so bad that at one point, the Mail on Sunday ran a hit piece with the title,

149
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:38,620
Labour must kill vampire Jezza, only ten days after the actual brutal murder of Labour MP

150
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,980
Joe Cox.

151
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,500
Luckily, someone eventually realised that this was something of a bad look, and the

152
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,620
online version changed its title slightly.

153
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,820
Corbyn signals sky-high immigration would continue under Labour.

154
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Continue from who?

155
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
From who?

156
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,780
Who's in charge here?

157
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,500
And let's not forget this piece of speculative fiction the Mail on Sunday actually printed

158
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,140
about a prospective Jeremy Corbyn leadership.

159
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,300
Prime Minister Corbyn and the thousand days that destroyed Britain as this brilliant imagining

160
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,300
of a Corbyn premiership, fuck you, reveals Tories who gloat over Labour's woe should

161
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,220
be careful what they wish for.

162
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,340
The night sky over London was thick with choking black smog.

163
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,380
By the way, Theresa May abolished the Climate Council.

164
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,220
You might want to retract that bit.

165
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,460
Not for him, the Prime Minister's Jaguar in which his hated Mrs Thatcher had departed

166
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,820
on the night she too was deposed.

167
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,940
All government cars had long since been sold in a desperate bid to pay off the three trillion

168
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,420
national debt.

169
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,700
Corbyn's chief of staff, Owen Jones, declared that the people had taken back their country.

170
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,860
The red flag was hung from the windows of number 10.

171
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,260
Russell Brand kept his garbled verbosity in check for once and simply tweeted,

172
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
YES!

173
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,460
Meanwhile, the media reporting the growing opposition to the government and the whispers

174
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,500
of a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons were accused of treachery.

175
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,020
The far-left had always believed that their inability to win elections was due to the

176
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,620
machinations of right-wing press barons who poisoned the people's minds against—

177
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,420
how can you not realize that you are doing that?

178
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,100
You're literally publishing fan fiction in which Jeremy Corbyn destroys Britain.

179
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,740
What the fuck?

180
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,980
Ironically, it was Corbyn's better nature that finally defeated him.

181
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,740
He lacked the Stalinist zeal to force the people into submission.

182
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,020
British Airways reported ticket sales on first-class flights out of London,

183
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,260
and none at all coming back.

184
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,980
One Direction went off on a U.S. tour and never returned.

185
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,060
Okay, this is actually starting to sound pretty good now.

186
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:55,140
Now, you might be inclined to say that a media willing to publish 2,600 words of fan fiction

187
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,580
about how Jeremy Corbyn destroyed Britain

188
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,180
could be a little bit biased against Corbyn and his politics,

189
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,340
and perhaps distorting his views somewhat.

190
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,700
You know, maybe a little bit.

191
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,380
But let's be fair. Media bias?

192
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,700
Where's your proof that's happening, you ask?

193
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,940
And you're right. Ignoring the wealth of evidence I've just provided for a second,

194
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,980
I don't have any proof that the media is misrepresenting Corbyn and his views.

195
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:27,060
All I have is eyes that read newspapers, a functioning brain, and, uh...

196
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,140
Oh, yeah, a study by the London School of Economics

197
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,660
showing that around 75% of press coverage of Corbyn and his views misrepresented him,

198
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,260
and only 11% of the total coverage didn't distort any of his views whatsoever,

199
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,540
with the Daily Express and Daily Mail failing to provide any such coverage at all.

200
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,540
Jeremy Corbyn is completely unelectable. Nobody likes him.

201
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
And we know this, said the media, because we keep lying about him.

202
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,700
But, eventually, the media started to find things they could smear him about

203
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,620
because they might actually be true.

204
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,180
For example, many have accused Corbyn of being soft on terrorism and the IRA.

205
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,300
Did you appear in a picture with the bad people, Jeremy?

206
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,980
Are you friends with the bad people, Jeremy?

207
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,780
Did you personally bomb the pub, Jeremy,

208
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,540
before riding off in your Mao-esque bicycle

209
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,900
or in your Stalin-adjacent weather balloon?

210
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,700
We here in my shed can bring you a special report

211
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,540
detailing all of Corbyn's shady dealings with the IRA.

212
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,420
During the 1980s, Corbyn spoke openly with both Irish Republicans and Ulster Loyalists

213
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,740
in an attempt to bring about a peaceful resolution to the Irish conflict.

214
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,060
During this period of openness, Margaret Thatcher was giving long speeches

215
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,700
explaining that it was wrong to negotiate with terrorists,

216
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,380
which it later turned out, from declassified documents,

217
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,940
she literally was doing in secret.

218
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,620
In 1994, Corbyn signed a parliamentary motion

219
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,540
on the 20th anniversary of the IRA pub bombing in Birmingham,

220
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,220
a motion which called the attack a terrorist atrocity.

221
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,300
In 1995, Corbyn met with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin,

222
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,460
the political wing of the Irish Republican movement,

223
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,500
which you'll be shocked to discover are not a terrorist group

224
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,220
unless people wanting to control their country terrifies you,

225
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,220
in which case I hope you didn't vote Brexit.

226
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,700
This happened either during or after the declaration

227
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,260
that the Northern Irish had the right to self-determination,

228
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,380
an event which led to the IRA ceasefire

229
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,660
and quite directly to the disbanding of the organisation entirely.

230
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,620
In 2013, Corbyn received the Gandhi Foundation International Peace Award

231
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,060
for, among hard opposition to pointless wars,

232
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,340
helping to bring a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.

233
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,500
And that's it.

234
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Clearly, a man known to be flip-flopping on whether or not he likes the IRA.

235
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,340
I can see how many Conservative ministers might be confused

236
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,020
as to what side Corbyn was on.

237
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,500
After all, it was a very confusing time for them.

238
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,420
Their Prime Minister was secretly negotiating with the IRA

239
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,860
while condemning the idea of negotiating with the IRA.

240
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,100
I can see how it might have been difficult for them to fathom

241
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,820
that there was a way of finding peace that didn't require lies,

242
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,500
smear tactics, and backchannels with terrorism.

243
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,660
Maybe they're criticising Corbyn for not talking to the IRA in secret like they were,

244
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,660
but none of this stopped the media from parading around the same couple of pictures again.

245
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,180
It's important to guilt people by association.

246
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,700
If you've met someone, you're guilty of all of their crimes,

247
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
even ones they've never actually committed.

248
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,300
Here's Corbyn with Sinn Féin President Jerry Adams.

249
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,940
Here's Corbyn with Sinn Féin President Jerry Adams.

250
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,300
Here's Prince Charles with Sinn Féin President Jerry A-

251
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Oh, dear, how did that get there?

252
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,140
Here's Vampire Jezza having coffee with Martin McGuinness.

253
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Here's Corbyn hanging out with Martin McGuinness.

254
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
And here's the Queen shaking hands with Martin McGuin-

255
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,420
Wait, no, cut! Rewind the-

256
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,260
Part three, will you kill millions, Jeremy?

257
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,580
One other thing the media and opposition have managed to hammer Corbyn on

258
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,340
is his stance on nuclear war.

259
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,300
Corbyn thinks it's bad and should be avoided at all costs, the monster.

260
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,140
We find it incredibly concerning that you-you wouldn't ever commit-commit to doing that.

261
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,980
It's our safety that we need to look out first and foremost in your government.

262
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,100
Jeremy has trouble giving a satisfying answer to that question.

263
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,700
You see, everyone expected him to immediately begin fantasizing

264
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,380
about the deaths he'd be willing to cause if he was pushed to it

265
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,620
and imagine a situation where he would have to push it so he could simply say yes or no,

266
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,500
but instead he went into this long, thoughtful piece

267
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,300
where he elaborated upon how even getting to that situation would put the world at tremendous risk

268
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,860
and the real solution is how you avoid doing that,

269
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,580
but that he would obviously pursue it as a second-use policy.

270
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,100
Naturally, people weren't happy with THAT kind of answer.

271
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,660
Would you allow North Korea or some idiot in Iran to bomb us?

272
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
You'd be too late!

273
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
No, of course not.

274
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,940
You're gonna have to do it first, mate!

275
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,380
No, of-

276
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,980
Will you kill millions, Jeremy?

277
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,780
Will you kill millions, Jeremy?

278
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,420
Jeremy, will you kill millions?

279
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,260
You see, I'd love to vote for you, Jeremy,

280
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,460
but as a Tory voter, I have this unquenchable thirst for blood

281
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:39,460
that can only be satiated with the most powerful weapon ever conceived by mankind!

282
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,420
The old adage is speak softly and carry a big stick,

283
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,740
not threaten everyone else who has a stick with your stick

284
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,380
and then wonder why everyone else has started hitting you.

285
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,380
If you position yourself as ready at any moment to hit the button,

286
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,100
your enemies prepare to hit theirs,

287
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,660
and that's not a great situation for the, you know, planet that we live on.

288
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,220
First use isn't a self-defense mechanism.

289
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
It's a self-destruct mechanism.

290
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,900
There is no situation where a first use will be the only use

291
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,660
because the second use will be to kill us back.

292
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,980
The times in history humanity has come the closest to nuclear war

293
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,180
have been caused by one side becoming convinced the other fully intended to

294
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,740
and was just about to launch their own weapons.

295
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,900
An active strategy of de-escalation doesn't sound very jingoistic or protective,

296
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,700
but it's literally the best option,

297
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,020
and fantasizing about how your enemies are constantly waiting to use theirs

298
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,140
the instant they smell weakness literally directly prolongs the problem.

299
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,020
Luckily, it's unlikely either of these gentlemen will ever get their hands on the

300
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,580
Kill Everyone Death button,

301
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,340
although, thanks to a recent investigation for election fraud,

302
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,580
I hear there might be an opening coming up in South Thanet.

303
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,220
Just before, I don't understand why everyone in this room seems so keen on...

304
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
killing millions of people with a nuclear bomb.

305
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Woo!

306
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,140
Part four, the policy problem.

307
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,500
But enough about the bikes Corbyn stole from history's greatest monsters

308
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,220
and how despicable it is that he won't nuke people.

309
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,660
What about both parties' actual policies?

310
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,500
Labour have a 128-page manifesto detailing all their ideas,

311
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,660
such as reducing class sizes in schools,

312
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,060
investing in infrastructure,

313
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,500
over $30 billion in funding for the NHS over the next parliament,

314
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,660
and free school meals for every child.

315
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,980
But where's the money for that gonna come from, Jezza?

316
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,540
There's no magic money tree.

317
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,020
And we have to stop thinking, as you do,

318
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,620
that there's a magic money tree.

319
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,020
I mean, he has this money tree wish list in his manifesto.

320
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,820
And I'm being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the NHS.

321
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,420
Wait, no, don't say that.

322
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,500
But there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake

323
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,140
that suddenly provides for everything that people want.

324
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,220
Teresa, someone's already used that one-liner.

325
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,300
You probably should have watched the fucking debate, shouldn't you?

326
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,580
Where's all the money gonna come from?

327
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,300
Oh, wait.

328
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,900
The manifesto is fully costed,

329
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,900
explaining how much every policy will cost in estimation,

330
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,540
and how the money will be raised.

331
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,420
For example, those free school meals I mentioned

332
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,740
are estimated to cost £0.9 billion,

333
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,980
and this cost will be covered by removing VAT exemption on private school fees,

334
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,660
making the country around £1.2 billion,

335
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,740
which actually puts the country further into the black than most austerity policies.

336
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,660
So what about the Conservatives' books?

337
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,740
Where does the money come from for their ideas?

338
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,100
Well, nobody knows,

339
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,580
because their smaller 88-page manifesto isn't costed.

340
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,260
It's very easy to think about how you spend money.

341
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,860
It's much harder to think about how you raise money.

342
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,380
Yeah, it is pretty hard, isn't it?

343
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,620
That's probably why the Conservatives didn't bother to check

344
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,700
how much money their ideas would cost.

345
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Luckily, former Chancellor Ken Clarke came to the Tories' rescue

346
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,580
by saying manifestos shouldn't be costed

347
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,740
because then the Chancellor can be flexible.

348
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,340
If you make no falsifiable promises and don't tell anyone anything specific,

349
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,540
then you can't be accused of not doing anything,

350
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,580
like he used to.

351
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,540
Vote Tory.

352
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,900
We'll balance the books,

353
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
although we don't know what's in them exactly.

354
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,380
You're just gonna have to trust us.

355
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,340
I'm gonna turn to, um, Amber Rod.

356
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,100
Uh, the question is about trusting plans,

357
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
and in your manifesto, there was a notable absence of costings.

358
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,340
Well, I would say in answer to that question,

359
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,900
judge us on our record.

360
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,740
On our record, we have cut costs.

361
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,220
We will cut costs.

362
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,620
All right, Amber, I get it.

363
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,860
There's no magic money tree.

364
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,620
All right, what about the actual fucking trees?

365
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,460
There's also the problem of what critics are calling the dementia tax.

366
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,380
The manifesto lays out that the elderly must pay for their own care

367
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,460
if they have savings and property worth more than £100,000.

368
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,020
In other words, if they own a house,

369
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,340
they'll probably have to sell it to pay for the care they'll need,

370
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,460
although if they don't want to lose their home for some reason,

371
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,940
the payment can be deferred until after they die.

372
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,100
How generous.

373
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,260
Taxes like this ask important questions,

374
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,540
such as part five, are the Tories trying to throw the election?

375
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,380
Are they trying to lose so that when Labour or someone else

376
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,460
inevitably don't get a great deal out of Brexit

377
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,300
because Brexit was a bad idea,

378
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,140
they can then spin it as their mistake?

379
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,580
Or are they just so sure they're going to win

380
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,260
that they don't even think they have to bother

381
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,860
hiding their true ideas?

382
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,500
Now, you might have expected Theresa May

383
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,420
to defend her party's policies at the leaders' debate,

384
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,900
but she didn't bother going to the leaders' debate.

385
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,020
She instead sent Home Secretary Amber Rudd,

386
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,180
seen before making the money tree comments.

387
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,540
A little odd, traditionally, for the Prime Minister

388
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,660
who thought it was an easy win to hide from being scrutinised.

389
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,580
Well, I'm interested, you know, in the fact that Jeremy Corbyn

390
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,220
seems to be paying far more attention

391
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,580
to how many appearances on telly he's doing.

392
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,980
I think he ought to be paying a little more attention

393
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,660
to thinking about Brexit negotiations.

394
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,660
That's what I'm doing to make sure we get the best possible deal for Britain.

395
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,340
Yes, I also wouldn't let myself be distracted

396
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,700
from Brexit negotiations by having to go to a debate

397
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,020
or by, for example, calling an election.

398
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,220
Must be distracting, Theresa, mustn't it?

399
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,500
That election that you called.

400
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,580
Remember, the one you said you wouldn't?

401
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,260
This level of incompetence is so exquisite

402
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,620
that it almost has to have been managed.

403
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,820
Hold on a second, Theresa.

404
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,340
I really don't want to belabor, ha, this point,

405
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,420
but the leaflet that got sent through my door

406
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,100
says strong, stable leadership in the national interest.

407
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,220
What leadership?

408
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,820
You didn't turn up to the fucking debate

409
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,380
and you won't tell us who's gonna be in your cabinet now!

410
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,220
There's been an increase in the Tories complaining

411
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,300
about how the media are biased against them.

412
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
For example, claiming the BBC used a purposefully biased audience

413
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,860
against them in the leaders' debate,

414
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,940
as if it is somehow possible to find an audience neutral

415
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,540
on a party not being bothered to send their leader

416
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,700
to the leader debate in an election they called.

417
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,100
And to be fair, I am also myself a little bit biased.

418
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,260
As a socialist, I'm biased in favor of peace,

419
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,740
justice, humanity, health care, uh, facts,

420
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
and the truth.

421
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,140
The Big Six, we call them.

422
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,660
Trying to do their side a favor,

423
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,380
the Sun attempted to spin the Tories' policies

424
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,780
as good for millennials.

425
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,860
For example, how awful would it be

426
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,780
if labor ended tuition fees?

427
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,460
This would surely benefit richer families more.

428
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,260
Poorer students would be left out in the dirt

429
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,020
without even the warmth of debt for comfort.

430
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,420
And taxes will be lighter on millennials under the Tories

431
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,340
because they're shifting so much of the burden

432
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,460
onto the elderly.

433
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,780
Wow, the sun's finally coming up on Tory Britain now, isn't it?

434
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,860
And now they're even saying,

435
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,460
make Britain great again,

436
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,980
something you'd think they'd have done

437
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,540
in the past seven years they've had in government.

438
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,300
But no, this time we promise cutting more stuff will work,

439
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,500
but just don't ask us how much stuff we're cutting.

440
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,300
This is the kind of strategy I would adopt

441
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,460
if I wanted to lose the election on purpose,

442
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,300
and I hope they are because that way

443
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,820
they're at least looking evil intentionally,

444
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,780
and that's not even getting into the arms dealing

445
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,820
with Saudi Arabia,

446
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
which we should probably go into a bit, shouldn't we?

447
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,580
Well, here's Nicholas Wilson,

448
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,260
a campaigner for anti-corruption,

449
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,300
trying to do just that on the 3rd of June.

450
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,780
And she was in Saudi Arabia in April of this year

451
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,980
selling arms of Saudi Arabia

452
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,340
of the country responsible for IS,

453
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,060
and they support IS.

454
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,860
Oh, who's that over there

455
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,460
surreptitiously handing a piece of paper to the chairman?

456
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,580
That's Amber Rudd, the current Home Secretary,

457
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,420
and Theresa May's star debater.

458
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,340
We supply arms to Saudi Arabia

459
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,140
through...

460
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,980
Which is the personality trait I wish to avoid?

461
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,260
Why? I'm sorry. Come on.

462
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Come on.

463
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,980
This is censorship.

464
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,900
That's certainly one way of holding a debate.

465
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,940
Now, I don't like being an alarmist sort of person,

466
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,820
but honestly, seeing stuff like this happen in Britain

467
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,260
is a little bit terrifying,

468
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
and it leads me to ask the question,

469
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,620
what if we're totally fucked?

470
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,860
Now, the way the polls are looking,

471
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,420
it seems like the Conservative Party

472
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,860
are going to get the most votes,

473
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,220
which, unfortunately, in our system,

474
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,460
means they'll win.

475
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,100
♪

476
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,820
We're gonna find out together

477
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,060
the real cost of the dementia tax,

478
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,740
of slashing budgets,

479
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,740
of their bizarre opinions about cybersecurity

480
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,380
and how, basically, you shouldn't be allowed

481
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,380
to have any privacy.

482
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,500
We're gonna find out what that really means

483
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,180
together over the next four years,

484
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,820
barring some miracle.

485
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,380
I became disillusioned with politics

486
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,460
on the 5th of May, 2011,

487
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,540
when the referendum on alternative votes

488
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
decided that, no, you shouldn't be allowed

489
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,980
to have a preference on who you would want to win

490
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,060
if the party you actually like doesn't have enough votes,

491
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,460
which effectively dooms the British left

492
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,980
to dividing their vote 18 ways,

493
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,100
whereas the right are very good at falling in line

494
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,780
and only really hemorrhage their vote, like, three ways.

495
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,460
Labour, the Lib Dems, the SMP, Plaid Cymru,

496
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,540
the Green Party.

497
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,740
Cumulatively, people in Britain favor left-wing ideas.

498
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,500
That's almost objectively a fact,

499
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,620
but the vote is split so many ways

500
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,380
along often quite similar policies

501
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,140
that the people don't get to have their vision realized

502
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,260
because the right-wing parties

503
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,860
always get more votes collectively

504
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,380
because there's less of them.

505
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,780
The cynical old me would probably say

506
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,140
that maybe we've already lost the battle

507
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,220
for the soul of our electoral system.

508
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,820
In my Brexit video, I talked about

509
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,900
how there's this almost inherent flaw,

510
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,300
even at the best of times in representative democracy,

511
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,460
where you're always at the risk

512
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,700
of generating a political elite

513
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,460
who do the thinking for everyone else

514
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,180
because they're the representatives,

515
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,420
thus making people collectively stupider

516
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,940
and worse at making these decisions.

517
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,420
But in retrospect, I was wrong.

518
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,700
I think the real problem is that maybe,

519
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,820
even when we know what we want,

520
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,100
we lack the ability to properly express

521
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,860
within our political system

522
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,380
the thing that we want and get it.

523
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,100
Maybe the next election

524
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,540
is the one where things actually get better

525
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,540
and the next five years are a chance to prepare

526
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,340
and regroup and really think about

527
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,820
what our strategy should be,

528
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,100
and that could be excellent.

529
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Hello?

530
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,220
What? You're kidding?

531
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,820
That's impossible. What?

532
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,220
They're back.

533
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,020
After all this time, they're back.

534
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,820
I thought they lied. I thought it was a story.

535
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,420
But after these years, after all these long years,

536
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,620
the moneybirds are finally home.

537
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,420
Hey, folks.

538
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,220
The last video got taken down with copyright stuff

539
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,820
and I had to re-edit it a little bit.

540
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
And then when I put it back up,

541
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,020
I messed up the credits.

542
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,620
Like, half the names were missing.

543
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,220
So I've decided to put them here.

544
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
All the names that I missed, they're here now.

545
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,820
I'm really sorry it happened.

546
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,220
But by the time I noticed the problem,

547
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,620
I was not going to re-edit the video for a third time

548
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,020
and like 100,000 people had already seen it.

549
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,820
So thank you to all of these people for being patient

550
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,020
and waiting for their names to come up in the credits.

551
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,220
Thank you very much for helping fund

552
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,620
whatever the hell it is that I'm doing here.

553
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm really out of breath.

554
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,020
I've been shouting about the moneybirds outside

555
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,220
for like an hour, trying to get the take right.

556
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,620
It probably looks terrible too.

557
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,820
Anyway, see ya.
