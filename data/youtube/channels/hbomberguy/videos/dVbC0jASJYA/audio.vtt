00:00.000 --> 00:13.300
It's election season! You know what that means! It's time for all the worthless fucking ideologues

00:13.300 --> 00:17.300
of the world to take time out of complaining that Magic the Gathering feminists are gonna

00:17.300 --> 00:22.060
steal their anime titties and pretend that they know anything about politics!

00:22.060 --> 00:29.220
But wait a minute! According to people who definitely aren't Nazis and just happen

00:29.220 --> 00:33.220
to have Iron Cross avatars, I'm also just a worthless ideologue!

00:33.220 --> 00:36.220
Well that's great! That means I can get in on the action!

00:39.220 --> 00:44.500
Lock your doors, activate your ray shield, settle in round the blessed computer monitor,

00:44.500 --> 00:50.220
and crack open a boy with your cold ones! It's time for Election Watch 2017!

00:54.220 --> 00:58.140
There's a bird in the rafters and I don't know how to get it out because it's scared

00:58.140 --> 00:59.140
of me, so it just goes away.

01:03.140 --> 01:08.420
How the hecking frig did we get here? Well, our story begins in 2015 when David

01:08.420 --> 01:12.540
Cameron, amidst hemorrhaging votes to further right parties calling to leave the EU and

01:12.540 --> 01:16.700
his own parties infighting about whether they wanted to remain or not, decided to defer

01:16.700 --> 01:20.620
this problem by pledging that if elected, he would hold a referendum on Britain's

01:20.620 --> 01:27.020
EU membership. After losing this election to Cameron despite living up to his party's

01:27.020 --> 01:31.100
principles of not having any anymore, Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader, triggering

01:31.100 --> 01:35.240
a leadership election. Among the folks running for leader was Jeremy Corbyn, on a platform

01:35.240 --> 01:40.920
of anti-austerity and anti-being-almost-exactly-like-the-Tories. To run for leader you need nominations from

01:40.920 --> 01:46.140
other MPs and, for a joke, several MPs nominated him certain he wouldn't actually win. Unfortunately

01:46.140 --> 01:50.080
for them it turns out that Labour's membership weren't in on the joke because the completely

01:50.080 --> 01:55.340
unelectable Corbyn was elected to the party leadership with the largest majority ever,

01:55.340 --> 01:56.940
even more than Tony Blair.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.700
Then the Brexit referendum came. Cameron's strategy of hoping the Conservatives would

02:00.700 --> 02:05.020
figure out their stance on Brexit before the referendum failed, with half his MPs going

02:05.020 --> 02:09.040
out in a giant bus with a lie on it to talk about how much cake we export to France and

02:09.040 --> 02:13.360
tell us about how the money birds will leave the EU with us and come back to build hospitals

02:13.360 --> 02:18.180
with magic, and the other half defending remaining on the admittedly shaky ground that it's

02:18.180 --> 02:23.180
a good idea and better for everyone. MPs on the Remain side included David Cameron, George

02:23.180 --> 02:27.940
Osborne, Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May, who fucking loved being in the

02:27.940 --> 02:28.940
European Union.

02:28.940 --> 02:34.340
And when I put all that together, when I think about the potential risk to jobs, the uncertainties

02:34.340 --> 02:39.100
for our economy if we were to leave, I do believe we are more secure in the EU.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.540
Keep an eye on her. I have a feeling she'll come up later.

02:41.540 --> 02:45.420
Labour was far less divided on Brexit, campaigning on the unified principles of remaining being

02:45.420 --> 02:49.860
good and trying to sabotage Corbyn's leadership and their own party along with it. Now, strangely

02:49.860 --> 02:54.660
enough, amidst the ruling party having no idea which was the better option and the opposition

02:54.660 --> 02:58.820
being too busy trying to kill itself, the Remain message got somewhat muddled and the

02:58.820 --> 03:02.620
referendum ended narrowly in favour of Britain leaving the European Union.

03:02.620 --> 03:06.100
Victorious, having finally gotten what he wanted and realising the time had come to

03:06.100 --> 03:10.740
settle in and get some actual work done, sorting things out and negotiating exactly how we

03:10.740 --> 03:14.460
leave, core leave campaigner Nigel Farage moved to America.

03:14.460 --> 03:19.140
Not that I'm criticising him. I think Farage has a point here. Who'd want to live in Britain?

03:19.140 --> 03:21.660
After all, we're leaving the European Union.

03:21.660 --> 03:25.740
Managing Brexit, we had David Cameron, who drooled out resigning if the referendum didn't

03:25.740 --> 03:29.580
go his way and, like Tories are known to do, committed to keeping his promises.

03:29.580 --> 03:33.660
In a way, there's a link to the decision to resign as Prime Minister. The country made

03:33.660 --> 03:38.820
a decision, a decision I advised against, but nonetheless, the decision's been made.

03:38.820 --> 03:43.100
I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and to get it right.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.900
Great, another leadership election. Luckily, since all the major pro-Brexit MPs had realised

03:47.900 --> 03:51.820
they didn't actually want to have to deal with this shit and fade it into the background,

03:51.820 --> 03:56.260
pro-Remain MP Theresa May won in a short landslide, in prime position to negotiate doing what

03:56.260 --> 03:59.180
she'd said just a few months prior would be a horrible mistake.

03:59.180 --> 04:03.060
Meanwhile, in Labour's camp, Labour ministers deliberated and, after losing a referendum

04:03.060 --> 04:06.620
because they were too busy trying to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn, concluded that the problem

04:06.620 --> 04:09.060
was Jeremy Corbyn and tried to get rid of him.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.900
I think Jeremy's position is now untenable and being the decent man that he is, I hope

04:13.900 --> 04:16.660
he will recognise that and step down.

04:16.660 --> 04:20.620
That way, they could get back to fulfilling Labour's destiny of being completely ineffective.

04:20.620 --> 04:24.980
In her resignation letter, former Shadow First Secretary of State Angela Eagle wrote to Corbyn,

04:32.980 --> 04:36.180
That's right, according to Eagle, Corbyn simply hadn't campaigned hard enough and

04:36.180 --> 04:37.940
that's what cost them the referendum.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.420
Unfortunately for her, many within Labour thought Corbyn had campaigned harder than

04:41.420 --> 04:45.420
anyone else and simply hadn't had any representation because the media were too busy reporting

04:45.420 --> 04:47.140
the Conservative infighting.

04:47.140 --> 04:48.140
One minister even wrote,

04:57.660 --> 05:00.180
Strong, inspiring words from that MP.

05:00.180 --> 05:01.700
Uh, what was their name again?

05:01.700 --> 05:03.260
Oh yeah, Angela Eagle.

05:03.260 --> 05:04.260
Wait, hold on a second.

05:04.260 --> 05:08.660
After a mass resignation, calls for Corbyn himself to resign and a vote of no confidence,

05:08.660 --> 05:11.420
Labour had its second leadership election in a year.

05:11.420 --> 05:15.860
True to her confusing and contradictory words, Angela Eagle proved how unelectable Corbyn

05:15.860 --> 05:20.020
was by running against him and then dropping out after eight days, but soon MPs figured

05:20.020 --> 05:23.380
out that they were sure they'd found the electable candidate, falling in line behind

05:23.380 --> 05:29.260
Owen Smith and, ready to get back to business, Smith spectacularly lost to Jeremy Corbyn,

05:29.260 --> 05:33.460
who won with an even larger percentage of the vote than he did last time, making him

05:33.460 --> 05:37.980
the most elected leader of Labour again, even more this time.

05:37.980 --> 05:43.180
It seems that Labour is definitively stuck with the unelectable weirdo that no-one wants,

05:43.180 --> 05:46.820
simply down to the fact that people want him there.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.820
Democracy's really confusing sometimes.

05:48.820 --> 05:52.700
Anyway, now that both parties had their leadership sorted out, we could finally get down to the

05:52.700 --> 05:58.020
brass tacks of actually negotiating Brexit, but then it turned out that no-one knows what

05:58.020 --> 05:59.020
Brexit means.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.580
Brexit means Brexit.

06:01.580 --> 06:04.300
Yeah, alright, yeah, okay.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.820
People talk about the sort of Brexit that there is going to be.

06:06.820 --> 06:07.820
Is it hard, soft?

06:07.820 --> 06:08.820
Is it grey, white?

06:08.820 --> 06:11.820
Actually, we want a red, white and blue Brexit.

06:11.820 --> 06:15.020
That is the right Brexit for the United Kingdom.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.940
Red, white and blue Brexit?

06:16.940 --> 06:17.940
So three Brexits?

06:17.940 --> 06:22.820
Or do all three cumulatively mean one Brexit singularly?

06:22.820 --> 06:25.140
I'm glad we have the daughter of a vicar working all this out.

06:25.140 --> 06:29.540
She'll be great at answering questions of consubstantiation.

06:29.540 --> 06:35.020
May was finally in prime position to handle these difficult negotiations out of the union

06:35.020 --> 06:39.380
she didn't want to leave, and luckily she could focus all of her time and effort onto

06:39.380 --> 06:42.060
it because she had ruled out a snap election.

06:42.060 --> 06:45.580
And like Tories are known to do, she committed to keeping her promises.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.860
The government should call a general election.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.460
Oh, wait, I meant the opposite of that.

06:50.460 --> 06:54.560
So here we are now attempting to negotiate one of the most important diplomatic deals

06:54.560 --> 06:58.260
in the history of our country, and being made to choose between a man who didn't want to

06:58.260 --> 07:02.020
leave but at least his party membership wanted him in charge, and a woman who didn't want

07:02.020 --> 07:05.940
to leave but whose party membership aren't even allowed to vote on who gets to be leader.

07:05.940 --> 07:10.060
For the pro-Brexit lot, it's a bit like having to choose between a rock and a hard place

07:10.060 --> 07:11.700
with a dementia tax.

07:11.700 --> 07:16.860
But don't worry, I'm certain the electorate will continue to make the shittest possible choice.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.940
Part two, media bias.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.500
But enough about how we got here.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.780
What about how the media talks about all of this?

07:22.780 --> 07:25.180
Let's look at how they talk about Jeremy Corbyn for a little bit.

07:25.180 --> 07:29.940
Many Labour MPs were certain he was unelectable, and the totally unbiased media made sure you

07:29.940 --> 07:33.600
knew those opinions ahead of even knowing why he was unelectable.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.980
But a couple of people think you wouldn't want to elect him, and it's imperative that

07:36.980 --> 07:40.420
you know they think that, over and over, forever.

07:40.420 --> 07:44.860
For a time, the early stories about the Corbster resembled an angry text algorithm generating

07:44.860 --> 07:50.000
random complaints based on the angle of his bow, or offhand comments about how world peace

07:50.000 --> 07:51.060
would be nice.

07:51.060 --> 08:00.460
It was almost as if Corbyn's actually left-wing policies, uh, threatened huge companies like

08:00.460 --> 08:06.260
News Corp, and they felt the need to smear him in order to try and destroy him.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.260
I mean, almost.

08:07.260 --> 08:09.420
I mean, a little bit, maybe.

08:09.420 --> 08:17.220
National anthem, outrage, Corb snubs the Queen, court jester, we put a hat on him so you know

08:17.220 --> 08:18.460
he's bad.

08:18.460 --> 08:22.940
The new Labour leader treated himself to a black cab at his home yesterday, abandoning

08:22.940 --> 08:28.580
the Chairman Mao-style bicycle his neighbours always see him riding.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.580
What?

08:29.580 --> 08:32.540
What's Mao-y about it, exactly?

08:32.540 --> 08:34.540
Like, what?

08:34.540 --> 08:41.580
I revealed how Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the prospect of an asteroid wiping out humanity.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.260
He has also called for the legalisation the...

08:44.260 --> 08:45.260
Um.

08:45.260 --> 08:48.780
He has also called for the legalisation of the possession of cannabis.

08:48.780 --> 08:52.580
Wait, hang on, I thought you didn't want us to elect him.

08:52.580 --> 08:56.540
Labour in meltdown, Corbyn, abolish the army.

08:56.540 --> 09:00.300
New leader's potty plan for world peace.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.020
Free rugby attacks cards.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.120
Did I wake in a foreign country?

09:05.120 --> 09:09.220
This is what happens when you elect a vegetarian to lead a pub.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.220
What?

09:10.220 --> 09:11.860
What does that have to do with anything?

09:11.860 --> 09:13.740
I retire from the army in six months.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.100
He can knock himself out.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.020
Good lad, he'll be gone from his job before you are yours.

09:18.020 --> 09:25.980
They're so mad, they even recycled some old propaganda they used with the last Labour

09:25.980 --> 09:26.980
leader.

09:26.980 --> 09:31.180
It got so bad that at one point, the Mail on Sunday ran a hit piece with the title,

09:31.180 --> 09:38.620
Labour must kill vampire Jezza, only ten days after the actual brutal murder of Labour MP

09:38.620 --> 09:39.980
Joe Cox.

09:39.980 --> 09:44.500
Luckily, someone eventually realised that this was something of a bad look, and the

09:44.500 --> 09:47.620
online version changed its title slightly.

09:47.620 --> 09:52.820
Corbyn signals sky-high immigration would continue under Labour.

09:52.820 --> 09:53.820
Continue from who?

09:53.820 --> 09:54.820
From who?

09:54.820 --> 09:56.780
Who's in charge here?

09:56.780 --> 10:02.500
And let's not forget this piece of speculative fiction the Mail on Sunday actually printed

10:02.500 --> 10:05.140
about a prospective Jeremy Corbyn leadership.

10:05.140 --> 10:10.300
Prime Minister Corbyn and the thousand days that destroyed Britain as this brilliant imagining

10:10.300 --> 10:16.300
of a Corbyn premiership, fuck you, reveals Tories who gloat over Labour's woe should

10:16.300 --> 10:18.220
be careful what they wish for.

10:18.220 --> 10:22.340
The night sky over London was thick with choking black smog.

10:22.340 --> 10:26.380
By the way, Theresa May abolished the Climate Council.

10:26.380 --> 10:29.220
You might want to retract that bit.

10:29.220 --> 10:33.460
Not for him, the Prime Minister's Jaguar in which his hated Mrs Thatcher had departed

10:33.460 --> 10:35.820
on the night she too was deposed.

10:35.820 --> 10:40.940
All government cars had long since been sold in a desperate bid to pay off the three trillion

10:40.940 --> 10:42.420
national debt.

10:42.420 --> 10:48.700
Corbyn's chief of staff, Owen Jones, declared that the people had taken back their country.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.860
The red flag was hung from the windows of number 10.

10:51.860 --> 10:57.260
Russell Brand kept his garbled verbosity in check for once and simply tweeted,

10:57.260 --> 10:58.260
YES!

10:58.260 --> 11:03.460
Meanwhile, the media reporting the growing opposition to the government and the whispers

11:03.460 --> 11:07.500
of a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons were accused of treachery.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.020
The far-left had always believed that their inability to win elections was due to the

11:11.020 --> 11:15.620
machinations of right-wing press barons who poisoned the people's minds against—

11:15.620 --> 11:18.420
how can you not realize that you are doing that?

11:18.420 --> 11:24.100
You're literally publishing fan fiction in which Jeremy Corbyn destroys Britain.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.740
What the fuck?

11:25.740 --> 11:29.980
Ironically, it was Corbyn's better nature that finally defeated him.

11:29.980 --> 11:34.740
He lacked the Stalinist zeal to force the people into submission.

11:34.740 --> 11:39.020
British Airways reported ticket sales on first-class flights out of London,

11:39.020 --> 11:41.260
and none at all coming back.

11:41.260 --> 11:44.980
One Direction went off on a U.S. tour and never returned.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.060
Okay, this is actually starting to sound pretty good now.

11:47.060 --> 11:55.140
Now, you might be inclined to say that a media willing to publish 2,600 words of fan fiction

11:55.180 --> 11:57.580
about how Jeremy Corbyn destroyed Britain

11:57.580 --> 12:01.180
could be a little bit biased against Corbyn and his politics,

12:01.180 --> 12:05.340
and perhaps distorting his views somewhat.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.700
You know, maybe a little bit.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.380
But let's be fair. Media bias?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.700
Where's your proof that's happening, you ask?

12:11.700 --> 12:15.940
And you're right. Ignoring the wealth of evidence I've just provided for a second,

12:15.940 --> 12:19.980
I don't have any proof that the media is misrepresenting Corbyn and his views.

12:19.980 --> 12:27.060
All I have is eyes that read newspapers, a functioning brain, and, uh...

12:27.060 --> 12:30.140
Oh, yeah, a study by the London School of Economics

12:30.140 --> 12:34.660
showing that around 75% of press coverage of Corbyn and his views misrepresented him,

12:34.660 --> 12:39.260
and only 11% of the total coverage didn't distort any of his views whatsoever,

12:39.260 --> 12:43.540
with the Daily Express and Daily Mail failing to provide any such coverage at all.

12:43.540 --> 12:47.540
Jeremy Corbyn is completely unelectable. Nobody likes him.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.540
And we know this, said the media, because we keep lying about him.

12:50.540 --> 12:54.700
But, eventually, the media started to find things they could smear him about

12:54.700 --> 12:56.620
because they might actually be true.

12:56.620 --> 13:01.180
For example, many have accused Corbyn of being soft on terrorism and the IRA.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.300
Did you appear in a picture with the bad people, Jeremy?

13:04.300 --> 13:06.980
Are you friends with the bad people, Jeremy?

13:06.980 --> 13:09.780
Did you personally bomb the pub, Jeremy,

13:09.780 --> 13:12.540
before riding off in your Mao-esque bicycle

13:12.540 --> 13:15.900
or in your Stalin-adjacent weather balloon?

13:15.940 --> 13:18.700
We here in my shed can bring you a special report

13:18.700 --> 13:22.540
detailing all of Corbyn's shady dealings with the IRA.

13:22.540 --> 13:27.420
During the 1980s, Corbyn spoke openly with both Irish Republicans and Ulster Loyalists

13:27.420 --> 13:30.740
in an attempt to bring about a peaceful resolution to the Irish conflict.

13:30.740 --> 13:34.060
During this period of openness, Margaret Thatcher was giving long speeches

13:34.060 --> 13:36.700
explaining that it was wrong to negotiate with terrorists,

13:36.700 --> 13:39.380
which it later turned out, from declassified documents,

13:39.380 --> 13:41.940
she literally was doing in secret.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.620
In 1994, Corbyn signed a parliamentary motion

13:44.620 --> 13:47.540
on the 20th anniversary of the IRA pub bombing in Birmingham,

13:47.540 --> 13:50.220
a motion which called the attack a terrorist atrocity.

13:50.220 --> 13:54.300
In 1995, Corbyn met with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin,

13:54.300 --> 13:56.460
the political wing of the Irish Republican movement,

13:56.460 --> 13:59.500
which you'll be shocked to discover are not a terrorist group

13:59.500 --> 14:02.220
unless people wanting to control their country terrifies you,

14:02.220 --> 14:04.220
in which case I hope you didn't vote Brexit.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.700
This happened either during or after the declaration

14:06.700 --> 14:09.260
that the Northern Irish had the right to self-determination,

14:09.260 --> 14:11.380
an event which led to the IRA ceasefire

14:11.380 --> 14:14.660
and quite directly to the disbanding of the organisation entirely.

14:14.660 --> 14:18.620
In 2013, Corbyn received the Gandhi Foundation International Peace Award

14:18.620 --> 14:21.060
for, among hard opposition to pointless wars,

14:21.060 --> 14:24.340
helping to bring a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.

14:24.340 --> 14:25.500
And that's it.

14:25.500 --> 14:30.500
Clearly, a man known to be flip-flopping on whether or not he likes the IRA.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.340
I can see how many Conservative ministers might be confused

14:33.340 --> 14:35.020
as to what side Corbyn was on.

14:35.020 --> 14:37.500
After all, it was a very confusing time for them.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.420
Their Prime Minister was secretly negotiating with the IRA

14:40.420 --> 14:43.860
while condemning the idea of negotiating with the IRA.

14:43.860 --> 14:46.100
I can see how it might have been difficult for them to fathom

14:46.100 --> 14:48.820
that there was a way of finding peace that didn't require lies,

14:48.820 --> 14:51.500
smear tactics, and backchannels with terrorism.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.660
Maybe they're criticising Corbyn for not talking to the IRA in secret like they were,

14:55.660 --> 14:59.660
but none of this stopped the media from parading around the same couple of pictures again.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.180
It's important to guilt people by association.

15:02.180 --> 15:05.700
If you've met someone, you're guilty of all of their crimes,

15:05.700 --> 15:07.700
even ones they've never actually committed.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.300
Here's Corbyn with Sinn Féin President Jerry Adams.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.940
Here's Corbyn with Sinn Féin President Jerry Adams.

15:12.940 --> 15:15.300
Here's Prince Charles with Sinn Féin President Jerry A-

15:15.300 --> 15:16.700
Oh, dear, how did that get there?

15:16.700 --> 15:20.140
Here's Vampire Jezza having coffee with Martin McGuinness.

15:20.140 --> 15:23.140
Here's Corbyn hanging out with Martin McGuinness.

15:23.140 --> 15:25.140
And here's the Queen shaking hands with Martin McGuin-

15:25.140 --> 15:26.420
Wait, no, cut! Rewind the-

15:26.420 --> 15:29.260
Part three, will you kill millions, Jeremy?

15:29.260 --> 15:32.580
One other thing the media and opposition have managed to hammer Corbyn on

15:32.580 --> 15:34.340
is his stance on nuclear war.

15:34.380 --> 15:38.300
Corbyn thinks it's bad and should be avoided at all costs, the monster.

15:38.300 --> 15:42.140
We find it incredibly concerning that you-you wouldn't ever commit-commit to doing that.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.980
It's our safety that we need to look out first and foremost in your government.

15:44.980 --> 15:48.100
Jeremy has trouble giving a satisfying answer to that question.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.700
You see, everyone expected him to immediately begin fantasizing

15:51.700 --> 15:54.380
about the deaths he'd be willing to cause if he was pushed to it

15:54.380 --> 15:58.620
and imagine a situation where he would have to push it so he could simply say yes or no,

15:58.620 --> 16:01.500
but instead he went into this long, thoughtful piece

16:01.500 --> 16:06.300
where he elaborated upon how even getting to that situation would put the world at tremendous risk

16:06.300 --> 16:08.860
and the real solution is how you avoid doing that,

16:08.860 --> 16:11.580
but that he would obviously pursue it as a second-use policy.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.100
Naturally, people weren't happy with THAT kind of answer.

16:14.100 --> 16:18.660
Would you allow North Korea or some idiot in Iran to bomb us?

16:18.660 --> 16:19.660
You'd be too late!

16:19.660 --> 16:20.660
No, of course not.

16:20.660 --> 16:21.940
You're gonna have to do it first, mate!

16:21.940 --> 16:22.380
No, of-

16:22.380 --> 16:23.980
Will you kill millions, Jeremy?

16:23.980 --> 16:25.780
Will you kill millions, Jeremy?

16:25.780 --> 16:27.420
Jeremy, will you kill millions?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.260
You see, I'd love to vote for you, Jeremy,

16:29.260 --> 16:33.460
but as a Tory voter, I have this unquenchable thirst for blood

16:33.460 --> 16:39.460
that can only be satiated with the most powerful weapon ever conceived by mankind!

16:39.460 --> 16:42.420
The old adage is speak softly and carry a big stick,

16:42.420 --> 16:45.740
not threaten everyone else who has a stick with your stick

16:45.740 --> 16:48.380
and then wonder why everyone else has started hitting you.

16:48.380 --> 16:51.380
If you position yourself as ready at any moment to hit the button,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.100
your enemies prepare to hit theirs,

16:53.100 --> 16:57.660
and that's not a great situation for the, you know, planet that we live on.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.220
First use isn't a self-defense mechanism.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.220
It's a self-destruct mechanism.

17:02.220 --> 17:05.900
There is no situation where a first use will be the only use

17:05.900 --> 17:08.660
because the second use will be to kill us back.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.980
The times in history humanity has come the closest to nuclear war

17:11.980 --> 17:16.180
have been caused by one side becoming convinced the other fully intended to

17:16.180 --> 17:18.740
and was just about to launch their own weapons.

17:18.740 --> 17:22.900
An active strategy of de-escalation doesn't sound very jingoistic or protective,

17:22.900 --> 17:24.700
but it's literally the best option,

17:24.700 --> 17:28.020
and fantasizing about how your enemies are constantly waiting to use theirs

17:28.020 --> 17:32.140
the instant they smell weakness literally directly prolongs the problem.

17:32.140 --> 17:36.020
Luckily, it's unlikely either of these gentlemen will ever get their hands on the

17:36.020 --> 17:37.580
Kill Everyone Death button,

17:37.580 --> 17:40.340
although, thanks to a recent investigation for election fraud,

17:40.340 --> 17:42.580
I hear there might be an opening coming up in South Thanet.

17:42.580 --> 17:46.220
Just before, I don't understand why everyone in this room seems so keen on...

17:46.980 --> 17:48.980
killing millions of people with a nuclear bomb.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.980
Woo!

17:50.980 --> 17:53.140
Part four, the policy problem.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.500
But enough about the bikes Corbyn stole from history's greatest monsters

17:56.500 --> 17:59.220
and how despicable it is that he won't nuke people.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.660
What about both parties' actual policies?

18:01.660 --> 18:05.500
Labour have a 128-page manifesto detailing all their ideas,

18:05.500 --> 18:07.660
such as reducing class sizes in schools,

18:07.660 --> 18:09.060
investing in infrastructure,

18:09.060 --> 18:12.500
over $30 billion in funding for the NHS over the next parliament,

18:12.500 --> 18:14.660
and free school meals for every child.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.980
But where's the money for that gonna come from, Jezza?

18:16.980 --> 18:18.540
There's no magic money tree.

18:18.540 --> 18:21.020
And we have to stop thinking, as you do,

18:21.020 --> 18:22.620
that there's a magic money tree.

18:22.620 --> 18:27.020
I mean, he has this money tree wish list in his manifesto.

18:27.020 --> 18:31.820
And I'm being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the NHS.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.420
Wait, no, don't say that.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.500
But there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake

18:34.500 --> 18:37.140
that suddenly provides for everything that people want.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.220
Teresa, someone's already used that one-liner.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.300
You probably should have watched the fucking debate, shouldn't you?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.580
Where's all the money gonna come from?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.300
Oh, wait.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.900
The manifesto is fully costed,

18:44.900 --> 18:47.900
explaining how much every policy will cost in estimation,

18:47.940 --> 18:49.540
and how the money will be raised.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.420
For example, those free school meals I mentioned

18:51.420 --> 18:53.740
are estimated to cost £0.9 billion,

18:53.740 --> 18:56.980
and this cost will be covered by removing VAT exemption on private school fees,

18:56.980 --> 18:59.660
making the country around £1.2 billion,

18:59.660 --> 19:03.740
which actually puts the country further into the black than most austerity policies.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.660
So what about the Conservatives' books?

19:05.660 --> 19:07.740
Where does the money come from for their ideas?

19:07.740 --> 19:09.100
Well, nobody knows,

19:09.100 --> 19:12.580
because their smaller 88-page manifesto isn't costed.

19:12.580 --> 19:15.260
It's very easy to think about how you spend money.

19:15.260 --> 19:17.860
It's much harder to think about how you raise money.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.380
Yeah, it is pretty hard, isn't it?

19:19.380 --> 19:21.620
That's probably why the Conservatives didn't bother to check

19:21.620 --> 19:23.700
how much money their ideas would cost.

19:23.700 --> 19:27.100
Luckily, former Chancellor Ken Clarke came to the Tories' rescue

19:27.100 --> 19:29.580
by saying manifestos shouldn't be costed

19:29.580 --> 19:31.740
because then the Chancellor can be flexible.

19:31.740 --> 19:35.340
If you make no falsifiable promises and don't tell anyone anything specific,

19:35.340 --> 19:37.540
then you can't be accused of not doing anything,

19:37.540 --> 19:38.580
like he used to.

19:38.580 --> 19:39.540
Vote Tory.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.900
We'll balance the books,

19:40.900 --> 19:42.900
although we don't know what's in them exactly.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.380
You're just gonna have to trust us.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.340
I'm gonna turn to, um, Amber Rod.

19:46.340 --> 19:49.100
Uh, the question is about trusting plans,

19:49.100 --> 19:52.100
and in your manifesto, there was a notable absence of costings.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.340
Well, I would say in answer to that question,

19:54.340 --> 19:55.900
judge us on our record.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.740
On our record, we have cut costs.

19:57.740 --> 19:59.220
We will cut costs.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.620
All right, Amber, I get it.

20:00.620 --> 20:01.860
There's no magic money tree.

20:01.860 --> 20:04.620
All right, what about the actual fucking trees?

20:04.620 --> 20:08.460
There's also the problem of what critics are calling the dementia tax.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.380
The manifesto lays out that the elderly must pay for their own care

20:11.380 --> 20:14.460
if they have savings and property worth more than £100,000.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.020
In other words, if they own a house,

20:16.020 --> 20:18.340
they'll probably have to sell it to pay for the care they'll need,

20:18.340 --> 20:21.460
although if they don't want to lose their home for some reason,

20:21.460 --> 20:23.940
the payment can be deferred until after they die.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.100
How generous.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.260
Taxes like this ask important questions,

20:27.260 --> 20:30.540
such as part five, are the Tories trying to throw the election?

20:30.540 --> 20:33.380
Are they trying to lose so that when Labour or someone else

20:33.380 --> 20:35.460
inevitably don't get a great deal out of Brexit

20:35.460 --> 20:37.300
because Brexit was a bad idea,

20:37.300 --> 20:39.140
they can then spin it as their mistake?

20:39.140 --> 20:41.580
Or are they just so sure they're going to win

20:41.580 --> 20:43.260
that they don't even think they have to bother

20:43.260 --> 20:44.860
hiding their true ideas?

20:44.860 --> 20:46.500
Now, you might have expected Theresa May

20:46.500 --> 20:49.420
to defend her party's policies at the leaders' debate,

20:49.420 --> 20:51.900
but she didn't bother going to the leaders' debate.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.020
She instead sent Home Secretary Amber Rudd,

20:54.020 --> 20:56.180
seen before making the money tree comments.

20:56.180 --> 20:58.540
A little odd, traditionally, for the Prime Minister

20:58.540 --> 21:01.660
who thought it was an easy win to hide from being scrutinised.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.580
Well, I'm interested, you know, in the fact that Jeremy Corbyn

21:04.580 --> 21:06.220
seems to be paying far more attention

21:06.220 --> 21:08.580
to how many appearances on telly he's doing.

21:08.580 --> 21:09.980
I think he ought to be paying a little more attention

21:09.980 --> 21:11.660
to thinking about Brexit negotiations.

21:11.660 --> 21:14.660
That's what I'm doing to make sure we get the best possible deal for Britain.

21:14.860 --> 21:17.340
Yes, I also wouldn't let myself be distracted

21:17.340 --> 21:20.700
from Brexit negotiations by having to go to a debate

21:20.700 --> 21:24.020
or by, for example, calling an election.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.220
Must be distracting, Theresa, mustn't it?

21:26.220 --> 21:28.500
That election that you called.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.580
Remember, the one you said you wouldn't?

21:30.580 --> 21:34.260
This level of incompetence is so exquisite

21:34.260 --> 21:36.620
that it almost has to have been managed.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.820
Hold on a second, Theresa.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.340
I really don't want to belabor, ha, this point,

21:40.340 --> 21:42.420
but the leaflet that got sent through my door

21:42.420 --> 21:46.100
says strong, stable leadership in the national interest.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.220
What leadership?

21:47.220 --> 21:48.820
You didn't turn up to the fucking debate

21:48.820 --> 21:51.380
and you won't tell us who's gonna be in your cabinet now!

21:51.380 --> 21:53.220
There's been an increase in the Tories complaining

21:53.220 --> 21:55.300
about how the media are biased against them.

21:55.300 --> 21:58.300
For example, claiming the BBC used a purposefully biased audience

21:58.300 --> 21:59.860
against them in the leaders' debate,

21:59.860 --> 22:02.940
as if it is somehow possible to find an audience neutral

22:02.940 --> 22:05.540
on a party not being bothered to send their leader

22:05.540 --> 22:08.700
to the leader debate in an election they called.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.100
And to be fair, I am also myself a little bit biased.

22:11.100 --> 22:14.260
As a socialist, I'm biased in favor of peace,

22:14.260 --> 22:18.740
justice, humanity, health care, uh, facts,

22:18.740 --> 22:19.740
and the truth.

22:19.740 --> 22:21.140
The Big Six, we call them.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.660
Trying to do their side a favor,

22:22.660 --> 22:25.380
the Sun attempted to spin the Tories' policies

22:25.380 --> 22:26.780
as good for millennials.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.860
For example, how awful would it be

22:28.860 --> 22:30.780
if labor ended tuition fees?

22:30.780 --> 22:33.460
This would surely benefit richer families more.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.260
Poorer students would be left out in the dirt

22:35.260 --> 22:38.020
without even the warmth of debt for comfort.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.420
And taxes will be lighter on millennials under the Tories

22:40.420 --> 22:42.340
because they're shifting so much of the burden

22:42.340 --> 22:43.460
onto the elderly.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.780
Wow, the sun's finally coming up on Tory Britain now, isn't it?

22:46.780 --> 22:47.860
And now they're even saying,

22:47.860 --> 22:49.460
make Britain great again,

22:49.460 --> 22:50.980
something you'd think they'd have done

22:50.980 --> 22:53.540
in the past seven years they've had in government.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.300
But no, this time we promise cutting more stuff will work,

22:57.300 --> 23:00.500
but just don't ask us how much stuff we're cutting.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.300
This is the kind of strategy I would adopt

23:02.300 --> 23:04.460
if I wanted to lose the election on purpose,

23:04.460 --> 23:06.300
and I hope they are because that way

23:06.300 --> 23:08.820
they're at least looking evil intentionally,

23:08.820 --> 23:10.780
and that's not even getting into the arms dealing

23:10.780 --> 23:11.820
with Saudi Arabia,

23:11.820 --> 23:13.820
which we should probably go into a bit, shouldn't we?

23:13.820 --> 23:15.580
Well, here's Nicholas Wilson,

23:15.580 --> 23:17.260
a campaigner for anti-corruption,

23:17.260 --> 23:19.300
trying to do just that on the 3rd of June.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.780
And she was in Saudi Arabia in April of this year

23:22.780 --> 23:25.980
selling arms of Saudi Arabia

23:25.980 --> 23:29.340
of the country responsible for IS,

23:29.340 --> 23:31.060
and they support IS.

23:31.060 --> 23:32.860
Oh, who's that over there

23:32.860 --> 23:35.460
surreptitiously handing a piece of paper to the chairman?

23:35.460 --> 23:37.580
That's Amber Rudd, the current Home Secretary,

23:37.580 --> 23:39.420
and Theresa May's star debater.

23:39.420 --> 23:43.340
We supply arms to Saudi Arabia

23:43.340 --> 23:45.140
through...

23:45.140 --> 23:47.980
Which is the personality trait I wish to avoid?

23:47.980 --> 23:52.260
Why? I'm sorry. Come on.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.260
Come on.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.980
This is censorship.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.900
That's certainly one way of holding a debate.

23:57.900 --> 24:00.940
Now, I don't like being an alarmist sort of person,

24:00.940 --> 24:04.820
but honestly, seeing stuff like this happen in Britain

24:04.820 --> 24:07.260
is a little bit terrifying,

24:07.300 --> 24:09.300
and it leads me to ask the question,

24:09.300 --> 24:12.620
what if we're totally fucked?

24:12.620 --> 24:14.860
Now, the way the polls are looking,

24:14.860 --> 24:16.420
it seems like the Conservative Party

24:16.420 --> 24:17.860
are going to get the most votes,

24:17.860 --> 24:20.220
which, unfortunately, in our system,

24:20.220 --> 24:21.460
means they'll win.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.100
♪

24:23.100 --> 24:24.820
We're gonna find out together

24:24.820 --> 24:27.060
the real cost of the dementia tax,

24:27.060 --> 24:28.740
of slashing budgets,

24:28.740 --> 24:32.740
of their bizarre opinions about cybersecurity

24:32.740 --> 24:34.380
and how, basically, you shouldn't be allowed

24:34.380 --> 24:35.380
to have any privacy.

24:35.420 --> 24:37.500
We're gonna find out what that really means

24:37.500 --> 24:39.180
together over the next four years,

24:39.180 --> 24:40.820
barring some miracle.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.380
I became disillusioned with politics

24:42.380 --> 24:44.460
on the 5th of May, 2011,

24:44.460 --> 24:47.540
when the referendum on alternative votes

24:47.540 --> 24:49.540
decided that, no, you shouldn't be allowed

24:49.540 --> 24:51.980
to have a preference on who you would want to win

24:51.980 --> 24:55.060
if the party you actually like doesn't have enough votes,

24:55.060 --> 24:57.460
which effectively dooms the British left

24:57.460 --> 24:59.980
to dividing their vote 18 ways,

24:59.980 --> 25:02.100
whereas the right are very good at falling in line

25:02.100 --> 25:04.780
and only really hemorrhage their vote, like, three ways.

25:04.860 --> 25:07.460
Labour, the Lib Dems, the SMP, Plaid Cymru,

25:07.460 --> 25:08.540
the Green Party.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.740
Cumulatively, people in Britain favor left-wing ideas.

25:12.740 --> 25:15.500
That's almost objectively a fact,

25:15.500 --> 25:17.620
but the vote is split so many ways

25:17.620 --> 25:20.380
along often quite similar policies

25:20.380 --> 25:24.140
that the people don't get to have their vision realized

25:24.140 --> 25:25.260
because the right-wing parties

25:25.260 --> 25:26.860
always get more votes collectively

25:26.860 --> 25:28.380
because there's less of them.

25:28.380 --> 25:30.780
The cynical old me would probably say

25:30.780 --> 25:34.140
that maybe we've already lost the battle

25:34.140 --> 25:37.220
for the soul of our electoral system.

25:37.220 --> 25:38.820
In my Brexit video, I talked about

25:38.820 --> 25:41.900
how there's this almost inherent flaw,

25:41.900 --> 25:44.300
even at the best of times in representative democracy,

25:44.300 --> 25:46.460
where you're always at the risk

25:46.460 --> 25:48.700
of generating a political elite

25:48.700 --> 25:50.460
who do the thinking for everyone else

25:50.460 --> 25:52.180
because they're the representatives,

25:52.180 --> 25:54.420
thus making people collectively stupider

25:54.420 --> 25:55.940
and worse at making these decisions.

25:55.940 --> 25:58.420
But in retrospect, I was wrong.

25:58.420 --> 26:02.700
I think the real problem is that maybe,

26:02.700 --> 26:04.820
even when we know what we want,

26:04.820 --> 26:07.100
we lack the ability to properly express

26:07.100 --> 26:08.860
within our political system

26:08.860 --> 26:11.380
the thing that we want and get it.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.100
Maybe the next election

26:13.100 --> 26:14.540
is the one where things actually get better

26:14.540 --> 26:16.540
and the next five years are a chance to prepare

26:16.540 --> 26:18.340
and regroup and really think about

26:18.340 --> 26:19.820
what our strategy should be,

26:19.820 --> 26:21.100
and that could be excellent.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.220
Hello?

26:32.820 --> 26:34.220
What? You're kidding?

26:34.220 --> 26:35.820
That's impossible. What?

26:52.820 --> 26:54.220
They're back.

26:54.220 --> 26:56.020
After all this time, they're back.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.820
I thought they lied. I thought it was a story.

27:02.420 --> 27:06.420
But after these years, after all these long years,

27:06.420 --> 27:08.620
the moneybirds are finally home.

27:20.020 --> 27:21.420
Hey, folks.

27:21.420 --> 27:24.220
The last video got taken down with copyright stuff

27:24.220 --> 27:25.820
and I had to re-edit it a little bit.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.820
And then when I put it back up,

27:27.820 --> 27:29.020
I messed up the credits.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.620
Like, half the names were missing.

27:30.620 --> 27:33.220
So I've decided to put them here.

27:33.220 --> 27:35.220
All the names that I missed, they're here now.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.820
I'm really sorry it happened.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.220
But by the time I noticed the problem,

27:38.220 --> 27:40.620
I was not going to re-edit the video for a third time

27:40.620 --> 27:43.020
and like 100,000 people had already seen it.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.820
So thank you to all of these people for being patient

27:45.820 --> 27:47.020
and waiting for their names to come up in the credits.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.220
Thank you very much for helping fund

27:49.220 --> 27:51.620
whatever the hell it is that I'm doing here.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.420
I'm really out of breath.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.020
I've been shouting about the moneybirds outside

27:54.020 --> 27:56.220
for like an hour, trying to get the take right.

27:56.220 --> 27:57.620
It probably looks terrible too.

27:57.620 --> 27:58.820
Anyway, see ya.
