0	17000	I'm the Angry Game Smasher and I'm here to speak truth to power and have opinions about
17000	18000	video games.
18000	24840	Hello friends and this time I'd like to talk about the recently released highly anticipated
24840	25840	game No Man's Sky.
25840	30600	The game is a variation on the Minecraft or Terraria style loot gathering and crafting
30600	34280	mechanics people have seen before, but with the central addition of an algorithmically
34280	39040	defined universe of incomprehensibly huge proportions populated with practically infinite
39040	41080	variations of flora and fauna.
41080	44840	In stark contrast to many space games which tend to feature lots of interactions with
44840	49320	aliens and epic space battles, No Man's Sky lives up to its name by using its massive
49320	52400	scale to tell a story surprisingly small in scope.
52400	56200	The bulk of your time is spent exploring the worlds you encounter which only you might
56200	60280	ever see, discovering and naming unique animals and waiting as your ship travels through the
60280	62400	vast unfathomable emptiness of space.
62400	67120	For me personally this generates a sense of ennui and humility previously consigned only
67120	72240	to obscure, poorly translated games from Russia and is an experience so rare for video games
72240	76960	that I fear many players may not have the capacity to even appreciate the attempt.
76960	81100	How can I tell you how polite I am if you won't take off your headphones?
81140	85140	We need to protect video games from people who did social studies!
85140	89500	Speaking of languages, the aliens you communicate with don't speak English and thus you have
89500	94340	to learn to communicate through sheer guesswork, or by slowly gleaning the translation of individual
94340	97140	words from artefacts hidden on various planets.
97140	100260	It's an exact replica of what it's like to try learning Danish.
100260	103460	Jake-kun-a-god-tain-kim-it-skovans-brigas!
103460	107380	Aliens speak in what amounts to English with a word filter over it, which seems initially
107620	112020	and unrealistic, but rather than attempting to populate an incredibly vast universe with
112020	116780	factions, characters and fully realized languages, Hello Games have made the thematically appropriate
116780	120720	decision to make the dialogue and interaction into an extension of the exploration mechanics,
120720	124220	where you generally know what you're going to encounter but the specifics are always
124220	125740	going to be just a little different!
125740	127460	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
127460	131140	I'm entitled to my own opinion, and that's the same thing as being right!
132980	137220	Deus Ex designer and human miracle war inspector once wrote that the theoretical best
137260	141580	game ever might take place in a relatively small, simple space which changes as a result
141580	143900	of your decisions over the course of the story!
143900	148180	No Man's Sky, by creating a gigantic universe but filling it with mundane and relatively
148180	152100	low-key mechanics, presents a facet of this philosophy from the opposite direction!
152100	156540	You're on a small personal journey where planets, languages, alien creatures and space
156540	161140	stations all start to feel ultimately meaningless, but which are constantly changing just enough
161140	165120	that while you're really on a small personal journey, the texture of the landscape is always
165120	168880	shifting and everything feels quirkily alien and yet recognizable!
168880	173720	But ultimately this small indie team has created a truly honest recreation of the intense vastness
173720	178800	of space by showing that everything is ultimately very similar and thesaurus mundane, I mean
178800	179800	commonplace!
179800	184560	There are doubtless many critics who will see this as a bad thing, as an objective mistake,
184560	188320	or as proof that they've been lied to by an evil developer, out to deprive them of
188320	191120	the mythical prelapsarian concept of fun!
191120	195000	I WILL NOT EVEN FUCKING BOTHER!
195000	196880	WE WERE FUCKING LIED TO!
196880	201680	But I fear I must politely disagree with their perspectives, because as someone who distanced
201680	205240	themselves from the inevitable marketing hype and managed to therefore experience the game
205240	209600	for what it actually is, I found myself falling in love with its particular kind of calm,
209600	210600	methodical pacing!
210600	214960	The kind that doesn't lend well to obnoxious, over-the-top, angry, cynical, platitude-ridden
214960	219080	videos that get that sweet, sweet YouTube ad revenue money flowing!
219080	223280	The moments of slow-paced idle wandering gave me time to fully immerse myself in the
223280	225480	feeling of being a space traveller!
225480	228920	Something I must admit I've never been made to feel before by a video game!
228920	233640	I felt lonely and adrift in an endless sea of stars and made to appreciate my smallness
233640	237480	in the face of the unending nihilistic DARKNESS OF THE COSMOS!
237480	241440	It reminded me of the year I spent dealing with insomnia by binge-reading Nietzsche and
241440	243240	Cormac McCarthy novels!
243240	247600	No Man's Sky forced me to meditate on the nature of my own existence in a way I've
247600	252480	never done with any video game, and it does this with its very precise use of simple mechanics
252480	255840	and relative emptiness other game critics are COMPLAINING ABOUT!
255840	260540	I have a sneaking suspicion that No Man's Sky is so perfectly designed to force moments
260540	264840	of introspection that gamers will be angry about it for forcing them to confront the
264840	270160	darkness within their own soul, what Georg Hegel referred to as the Night of the World!
270160	272600	Or as he would have put it, Das Nichts.
272600	276640	It's at once straightforward, massive, tiny, daunting, and enriching in a manner one might
276680	278680	be inclined to describe as spiritual.
278680	283280	However, the current expectations of space games is to be all singing all dancing experiences
283280	287240	of being an epic cybermarine who makes hashtag important decisions.
287240	291760	So I highly doubt too many people will approach this game with the good faith required to
291760	294520	make this game's interesting facets truly blossom forth.
294520	300600	The game footage you're seeing here was borrowed from streamers because I find it
300600	302440	intense personal fulfilment.
302440	305840	In the knowledge it is incredibly unlikely anyone will ever see the exact creatures I
305840	307280	did on the planet I visited.
307280	311080	If you're the sort of person who sees something gleeful in the knowledge that your experience
311080	315760	won't quite line up with anyone else's, I heartily recommend No Man's Sky to you,
315760	316760	sailor!
316760	319480	However, I cannot currently specifically recommend the PC version.
319480	323580	It may be my hardware, but the game was awfully laggy, and even when editing the .ini files
323580	327400	I found it was completely impossible to make my mouse sensitivity function properly.
327400	330480	Luckily I had played the game just little enough to refund it and revisit it in the
330480	332640	vastly more stable PS4 version.
332920	336560	Thank you for taking the time to watch this video and have a wonderful evening!
