00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm the Angry Game Smasher and I'm here to speak truth to power and have opinions about

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
video games.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,840
Hello friends and this time I'd like to talk about the recently released highly anticipated

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
game No Man's Sky.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,600
The game is a variation on the Minecraft or Terraria style loot gathering and crafting

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,280
mechanics people have seen before, but with the central addition of an algorithmically

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,040
defined universe of incomprehensibly huge proportions populated with practically infinite

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,080
variations of flora and fauna.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,840
In stark contrast to many space games which tend to feature lots of interactions with

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,320
aliens and epic space battles, No Man's Sky lives up to its name by using its massive

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,400
scale to tell a story surprisingly small in scope.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,200
The bulk of your time is spent exploring the worlds you encounter which only you might

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,280
ever see, discovering and naming unique animals and waiting as your ship travels through the

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,400
vast unfathomable emptiness of space.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,120
For me personally this generates a sense of ennui and humility previously consigned only

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,240
to obscure, poorly translated games from Russia and is an experience so rare for video games

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,960
that I fear many players may not have the capacity to even appreciate the attempt.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,100
How can I tell you how polite I am if you won't take off your headphones?

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,140
We need to protect video games from people who did social studies!

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,500
Speaking of languages, the aliens you communicate with don't speak English and thus you have

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,340
to learn to communicate through sheer guesswork, or by slowly gleaning the translation of individual

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,140
words from artefacts hidden on various planets.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,260
It's an exact replica of what it's like to try learning Danish.

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,460
Jake-kun-a-god-tain-kim-it-skovans-brigas!

25
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,380
Aliens speak in what amounts to English with a word filter over it, which seems initially

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,020
and unrealistic, but rather than attempting to populate an incredibly vast universe with

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,780
factions, characters and fully realized languages, Hello Games have made the thematically appropriate

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,720
decision to make the dialogue and interaction into an extension of the exploration mechanics,

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,220
where you generally know what you're going to encounter but the specifics are always

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,740
going to be just a little different!

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,460
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,140
I'm entitled to my own opinion, and that's the same thing as being right!

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,220
Deus Ex designer and human miracle war inspector once wrote that the theoretical best

34
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,580
game ever might take place in a relatively small, simple space which changes as a result

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,900
of your decisions over the course of the story!

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,180
No Man's Sky, by creating a gigantic universe but filling it with mundane and relatively

37
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,100
low-key mechanics, presents a facet of this philosophy from the opposite direction!

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,540
You're on a small personal journey where planets, languages, alien creatures and space

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,140
stations all start to feel ultimately meaningless, but which are constantly changing just enough

40
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,120
that while you're really on a small personal journey, the texture of the landscape is always

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,880
shifting and everything feels quirkily alien and yet recognizable!

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,720
But ultimately this small indie team has created a truly honest recreation of the intense vastness

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,800
of space by showing that everything is ultimately very similar and thesaurus mundane, I mean

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
commonplace!

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,560
There are doubtless many critics who will see this as a bad thing, as an objective mistake,

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,320
or as proof that they've been lied to by an evil developer, out to deprive them of

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,120
the mythical prelapsarian concept of fun!

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,000
I WILL NOT EVEN FUCKING BOTHER!

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,880
WE WERE FUCKING LIED TO!

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,680
But I fear I must politely disagree with their perspectives, because as someone who distanced

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,240
themselves from the inevitable marketing hype and managed to therefore experience the game

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,600
for what it actually is, I found myself falling in love with its particular kind of calm,

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
methodical pacing!

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,960
The kind that doesn't lend well to obnoxious, over-the-top, angry, cynical, platitude-ridden

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,080
videos that get that sweet, sweet YouTube ad revenue money flowing!

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,280
The moments of slow-paced idle wandering gave me time to fully immerse myself in the

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,480
feeling of being a space traveller!

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,920
Something I must admit I've never been made to feel before by a video game!

59
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,640
I felt lonely and adrift in an endless sea of stars and made to appreciate my smallness

60
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,480
in the face of the unending nihilistic DARKNESS OF THE COSMOS!

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,440
It reminded me of the year I spent dealing with insomnia by binge-reading Nietzsche and

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,240
Cormac McCarthy novels!

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,600
No Man's Sky forced me to meditate on the nature of my own existence in a way I've

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,480
never done with any video game, and it does this with its very precise use of simple mechanics

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
and relative emptiness other game critics are COMPLAINING ABOUT!

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,540
I have a sneaking suspicion that No Man's Sky is so perfectly designed to force moments

67
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,840
of introspection that gamers will be angry about it for forcing them to confront the

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,160
darkness within their own soul, what Georg Hegel referred to as the Night of the World!

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Or as he would have put it, Das Nichts.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,640
It's at once straightforward, massive, tiny, daunting, and enriching in a manner one might

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
be inclined to describe as spiritual.

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,280
However, the current expectations of space games is to be all singing all dancing experiences

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,240
of being an epic cybermarine who makes hashtag important decisions.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,760
So I highly doubt too many people will approach this game with the good faith required to

75
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,520
make this game's interesting facets truly blossom forth.

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,600
The game footage you're seeing here was borrowed from streamers because I find it

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,440
intense personal fulfilment.

78
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,840
In the knowledge it is incredibly unlikely anyone will ever see the exact creatures I

79
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
did on the planet I visited.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,080
If you're the sort of person who sees something gleeful in the knowledge that your experience

81
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,760
won't quite line up with anyone else's, I heartily recommend No Man's Sky to you,

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
sailor!

83
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,480
However, I cannot currently specifically recommend the PC version.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,580
It may be my hardware, but the game was awfully laggy, and even when editing the .ini files

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,400
I found it was completely impossible to make my mouse sensitivity function properly.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,480
Luckily I had played the game just little enough to refund it and revisit it in the

87
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,640
vastly more stable PS4 version.

88
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,560
Thank you for taking the time to watch this video and have a wonderful evening!

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,500
AHHHHHHHHH

I genuinely apologize for this mistake

109
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,540
AHHHHHHHHHH

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,960
If you put trigger warnings at the beginning of your videos I'll fucking shit myself

111
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,400
Shit

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Who's laughing now
