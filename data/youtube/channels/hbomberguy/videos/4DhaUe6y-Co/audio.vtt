00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm the Angry Game Smasher and I'm here to speak truth to power and have opinions about

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
video games.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.840
Hello friends and this time I'd like to talk about the recently released highly anticipated

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
game No Man's Sky.

00:25.840 --> 00:30.600
The game is a variation on the Minecraft or Terraria style loot gathering and crafting

00:30.600 --> 00:34.280
mechanics people have seen before, but with the central addition of an algorithmically

00:34.280 --> 00:39.040
defined universe of incomprehensibly huge proportions populated with practically infinite

00:39.040 --> 00:41.080
variations of flora and fauna.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.840
In stark contrast to many space games which tend to feature lots of interactions with

00:44.840 --> 00:49.320
aliens and epic space battles, No Man's Sky lives up to its name by using its massive

00:49.320 --> 00:52.400
scale to tell a story surprisingly small in scope.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.200
The bulk of your time is spent exploring the worlds you encounter which only you might

00:56.200 --> 01:00.280
ever see, discovering and naming unique animals and waiting as your ship travels through the

01:00.280 --> 01:02.400
vast unfathomable emptiness of space.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.120
For me personally this generates a sense of ennui and humility previously consigned only

01:07.120 --> 01:12.240
to obscure, poorly translated games from Russia and is an experience so rare for video games

01:12.240 --> 01:16.960
that I fear many players may not have the capacity to even appreciate the attempt.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.100
How can I tell you how polite I am if you won't take off your headphones?

01:21.140 --> 01:25.140
We need to protect video games from people who did social studies!

01:25.140 --> 01:29.500
Speaking of languages, the aliens you communicate with don't speak English and thus you have

01:29.500 --> 01:34.340
to learn to communicate through sheer guesswork, or by slowly gleaning the translation of individual

01:34.340 --> 01:37.140
words from artefacts hidden on various planets.

01:37.140 --> 01:40.260
It's an exact replica of what it's like to try learning Danish.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.460
Jake-kun-a-god-tain-kim-it-skovans-brigas!

01:43.460 --> 01:47.380
Aliens speak in what amounts to English with a word filter over it, which seems initially

01:47.620 --> 01:52.020
and unrealistic, but rather than attempting to populate an incredibly vast universe with

01:52.020 --> 01:56.780
factions, characters and fully realized languages, Hello Games have made the thematically appropriate

01:56.780 --> 02:00.720
decision to make the dialogue and interaction into an extension of the exploration mechanics,

02:00.720 --> 02:04.220
where you generally know what you're going to encounter but the specifics are always

02:04.220 --> 02:05.740
going to be just a little different!

02:05.740 --> 02:07.460
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

02:07.460 --> 02:11.140
I'm entitled to my own opinion, and that's the same thing as being right!

02:12.980 --> 02:17.220
Deus Ex designer and human miracle war inspector once wrote that the theoretical best

02:17.260 --> 02:21.580
game ever might take place in a relatively small, simple space which changes as a result

02:21.580 --> 02:23.900
of your decisions over the course of the story!

02:23.900 --> 02:28.180
No Man's Sky, by creating a gigantic universe but filling it with mundane and relatively

02:28.180 --> 02:32.100
low-key mechanics, presents a facet of this philosophy from the opposite direction!

02:32.100 --> 02:36.540
You're on a small personal journey where planets, languages, alien creatures and space

02:36.540 --> 02:41.140
stations all start to feel ultimately meaningless, but which are constantly changing just enough

02:41.140 --> 02:45.120
that while you're really on a small personal journey, the texture of the landscape is always

02:45.120 --> 02:48.880
shifting and everything feels quirkily alien and yet recognizable!

02:48.880 --> 02:53.720
But ultimately this small indie team has created a truly honest recreation of the intense vastness

02:53.720 --> 02:58.800
of space by showing that everything is ultimately very similar and thesaurus mundane, I mean

02:58.800 --> 02:59.800
commonplace!

02:59.800 --> 03:04.560
There are doubtless many critics who will see this as a bad thing, as an objective mistake,

03:04.560 --> 03:08.320
or as proof that they've been lied to by an evil developer, out to deprive them of

03:08.320 --> 03:11.120
the mythical prelapsarian concept of fun!

03:11.120 --> 03:15.000
I WILL NOT EVEN FUCKING BOTHER!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.880
WE WERE FUCKING LIED TO!

03:16.880 --> 03:21.680
But I fear I must politely disagree with their perspectives, because as someone who distanced

03:21.680 --> 03:25.240
themselves from the inevitable marketing hype and managed to therefore experience the game

03:25.240 --> 03:29.600
for what it actually is, I found myself falling in love with its particular kind of calm,

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
methodical pacing!

03:30.600 --> 03:34.960
The kind that doesn't lend well to obnoxious, over-the-top, angry, cynical, platitude-ridden

03:34.960 --> 03:39.080
videos that get that sweet, sweet YouTube ad revenue money flowing!

03:39.080 --> 03:43.280
The moments of slow-paced idle wandering gave me time to fully immerse myself in the

03:43.280 --> 03:45.480
feeling of being a space traveller!

03:45.480 --> 03:48.920
Something I must admit I've never been made to feel before by a video game!

03:48.920 --> 03:53.640
I felt lonely and adrift in an endless sea of stars and made to appreciate my smallness

03:53.640 --> 03:57.480
in the face of the unending nihilistic DARKNESS OF THE COSMOS!

03:57.480 --> 04:01.440
It reminded me of the year I spent dealing with insomnia by binge-reading Nietzsche and

04:01.440 --> 04:03.240
Cormac McCarthy novels!

04:03.240 --> 04:07.600
No Man's Sky forced me to meditate on the nature of my own existence in a way I've

04:07.600 --> 04:12.480
never done with any video game, and it does this with its very precise use of simple mechanics

04:12.480 --> 04:15.840
and relative emptiness other game critics are COMPLAINING ABOUT!

04:15.840 --> 04:20.540
I have a sneaking suspicion that No Man's Sky is so perfectly designed to force moments

04:20.540 --> 04:24.840
of introspection that gamers will be angry about it for forcing them to confront the

04:24.840 --> 04:30.160
darkness within their own soul, what Georg Hegel referred to as the Night of the World!

04:30.160 --> 04:32.600
Or as he would have put it, Das Nichts.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.640
It's at once straightforward, massive, tiny, daunting, and enriching in a manner one might

04:36.680 --> 04:38.680
be inclined to describe as spiritual.

04:38.680 --> 04:43.280
However, the current expectations of space games is to be all singing all dancing experiences

04:43.280 --> 04:47.240
of being an epic cybermarine who makes hashtag important decisions.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.760
So I highly doubt too many people will approach this game with the good faith required to

04:51.760 --> 04:54.520
make this game's interesting facets truly blossom forth.

04:54.520 --> 05:00.600
The game footage you're seeing here was borrowed from streamers because I find it

05:00.600 --> 05:02.440
intense personal fulfilment.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.840
In the knowledge it is incredibly unlikely anyone will ever see the exact creatures I

05:05.840 --> 05:07.280
did on the planet I visited.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.080
If you're the sort of person who sees something gleeful in the knowledge that your experience

05:11.080 --> 05:15.760
won't quite line up with anyone else's, I heartily recommend No Man's Sky to you,

05:15.760 --> 05:16.760
sailor!

05:16.760 --> 05:19.480
However, I cannot currently specifically recommend the PC version.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.580
It may be my hardware, but the game was awfully laggy, and even when editing the .ini files

05:23.580 --> 05:27.400
I found it was completely impossible to make my mouse sensitivity function properly.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.480
Luckily I had played the game just little enough to refund it and revisit it in the

05:30.480 --> 05:32.640
vastly more stable PS4 version.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.560
Thank you for taking the time to watch this video and have a wonderful evening!

05:36.640 --> 05:38.500
AHHHHHHHHH

06:31.980 --> 06:34.620
I genuinely apologize for this mistake

06:37.180 --> 06:38.540
AHHHHHHHHHH

06:38.940 --> 06:42.960
If you put trigger warnings at the beginning of your videos I'll fucking shit myself

06:47.020 --> 06:48.400
Shit

06:51.500 --> 06:53.500
Who's laughing now
