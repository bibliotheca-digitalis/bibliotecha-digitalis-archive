00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Hello, true believers! In case you haven't noticed, it's been just over a full year

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,600
since I started making videos more frequently after getting sick of having a real job and

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,400
marketable skills. And to celebrate my one-year anniversary, ooh, uh, I'd like to take a

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,320
look back at that first thing I made.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,880
I've always had a few criticisms of the Cultural Marxism video. It's very clear I'm poorly

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,820
mastering audio recorded on a Blue Yeti in a very echoey spare room. What was I thinking

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,820
with that hairstyle? And worst of all, I feel like I might have accidentally strawmanned

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,660
some people. I directly compared everyone who talked about Cultural Marxists to the

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,300
fascist literal Nazis who invented the term and the BNP youth who happened to include

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,140
them in their list that happened to include even more direct antisemitism. And that's

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,980
just not fair. Maybe I should go back and reassess some of these folks and see if there's

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,340
a little more nuance to their beliefs.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,580
Let's check out the Golden One. What's he been up to these days? He made that video

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,740
about how the Cultural Marxists are teaming up with the leftist Beatas to destroy the

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,620
family using a sledgehammer and by demanding more medals. In April 2015, he's had even

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,500
longer to develop creatively and intellectually than I have. So let's give this bloke another

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,180
shot and see where his arguments have led him.

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:24,860
["Hymne to the Red Army"]

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,140
Oh!

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,660
So after checking out his more recent work, the throughline hasn't really progressed in

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,900
the year and change since his Cultural Marxism video. He's just got more overt about liking

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,340
fascism and nationalism and being an alpha and not liking the leftist Beatas and Jews.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,860
Today I want to discuss the JQ, the Jewish question.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,580
Okay, now let's be clear here, folks. Mr. The Golden doesn't hate Jews per se.

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,580
There is a large difference between the international Jewish community,

26
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,820
or AKA international Jewry, and the Jewish individual.

27
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,580
Oh, I see what he's going for here. He's not mad at individual Jews,

28
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:13,020
just the vague conspiracy he made up that he also targets explicitly for its Jewishness.

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,220
How could anyone confuse that with anti-Semitism?

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,740
Now a lot of mere mortals with a pleb-tier understanding of the world say like,

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,260
oh, Hitler hated Jews. Uh, no, he actually didn't.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,740
The Golden One then goes on to elaborate by explaining how Hitler wasn't an anti-Semite

33
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,220
either and he was just doing the same thâ€”oh. Oh, no.

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,460
Hitler's battle was against international Jewry, international finance.

35
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,540
That is what that was about. It was not some sort of ethnic hatred.

36
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,340
Yeah, I'm sure all this imagery the Nazi propaganda machine put out

37
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,700
actually has a really subtle point to make about international finance.

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,900
How could he possibly be racist if he's not against physical Jews,

39
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,900
but just the vague concept of bad people which he happens to keep calling Jews?

40
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,940
That's not racism. It just looks like it, and sounds like it, and definitely is.

41
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,420
I'm not downplaying the genetic component of the National Socialist Time.

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,500
Alas, to focus on that part takes away the focus on the more interesting topic

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,380
of international banking and a debt-based economy.

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,980
I am interested in the Adolf Hitler due to his economic policies.

45
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,700
I am not concerned with the racial policies.

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,660
And he is kind of right. Hitler's economic policy was pretty good.

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,940
He reduced unemployment by opening up lots of new job openings.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,260
I wonder how he did that!

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,860
I think you can tell a lot about a person's true politics from their priorities.

50
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,420
For example, this video where he spends eight minutes

51
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,660
defending Richard Spencer's right to do the Sieg Heil salute without anyone judging him.

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,580
And they say, you can't do this, what will I do then?

53
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,860
Yes, I will say, you know what, fuck you, I'm gonna do whatever I want to do,

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,660
and then I throw up my arm in a Roman salute.

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,020
Freedom of speech is great precisely because when you look at someone

56
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,900
and you see them choosing to use their freedom to defend the Hitler salute,

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,580
you know who you're dealing with.

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,060
I don't do it as a sign of hate to anyone.

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,260
If you ever see me doing a Roman salute, it is not aimed at you.

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,180
It is not a sign of hate to you.

61
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,300
It's a sign for me to say to myself and to everyone else,

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,260
and especially to the establishment, that, you know what, you have no power over me.

63
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,220
If you have to keep telling people with the Hitler salute

64
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,980
that you don't care what they think about you, then you do.

65
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,060
You know that kid in high school who would go around constantly telling everyone

66
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,980
that he doesn't care what they think about him,

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,220
almost as if he cares a little bit too much?

68
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm getting that same weird insecurity vibe, but from a 26-year-old bodybuilder,

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,940
and that's just a bit sad.

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,820
The flexing thing wasn't a one-off, by the way.

71
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,500
He opens a lot of videos like that.

72
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,060
Greetings, true friends.

73
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,980
You can tell this guy's not a feminist because, well, it was a Nazi,

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,340
but also because he seems to love to objectify himself

75
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,860
and reduce himself to just a body, you know?

76
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,980
Which, to be fair, is a little bit easier than forming a personality.

77
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,540
I mean, if the ideas you spout aren't very good,

78
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,380
you might as well look good doing it, right?

79
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:24,860
I've always wanted to be on the front cover of a Chuck Tingle book,

80
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,100
and thanks to the inspirational words of a Swedish racist, I'm well on my way.

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,420
Ha ha, ah, ha ha, ah!

82
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,700
While I'm pumping my lats, or my tris, or whatever this bit is,

83
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,820
let's check out his website.

84
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,460
TheGoldenOne.se.

85
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,380
Honor the gods.

86
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,660
Love your woman.

87
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,020
Defend your country.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,740
Check out my Instagram!

89
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,460
Oh, boy, the Golden One's reading list.

90
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,020
Oh, hey, he's read the Way of Men by Jack Donovan,

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,340
or at least posed with it in front of his...

92
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,860
arm...sep.

93
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,020
I wonder where he saw that book being advertised.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh, oh, yeah, Western Civilization bites back,

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,740
because when I think of Western Civilization,

96
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,740
I personify it as animals from Africa that never founded a society,

97
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,820
or built any houses.

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,940
Last I checked, tigers haven't even learned how to open Etsy stores yet.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,660
Wow, uh, a lot of fiction books about made-up fantasy battles here.

100
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,420
Lots of, uh, fake magic wars going on in the Golden One's library.

101
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,940
Not a lot of political philosophy...

102
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,860
or any.

103
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
He used to be sponsored by various products,

104
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,540
but as they slowly realized that he's a complete monster,

105
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,060
they dropped their sponsorship.

106
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,420
And he has some very strong words to say about the Jews behind this.

107
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,700
I mean, I mean, it's not the Je-

108
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,660
I'm not racist!

109
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,420
Mark Lobliner, he's Jewish,

110
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,780
but he has never said anything against my political views.

111
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
And I see so many people, you know,

112
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,580
coming with anti-Jewish sentiments towards him

113
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,380
just because he is, uh, Jewish.

114
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,540
And now, realize this,

115
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,260
that there is a huge difference between the Internationale Klicke,

116
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,060
a.k.a. Global-

117
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,580
Hang on, is he doing the speech again?

118
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,860
Is he doing the exact same-

119
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,660
Hang on, wait a second.

120
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,580
Weird.

121
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,340
He has to keep reminding his people it's not right to be anti-Semitic.

122
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,460
Almost as if nationalism and racism come from the same place.

123
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,260
Almost.

124
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,300
He later goes on to say he didn't like how the product was American-made,

125
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,420
so there were shipping costs,

126
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,220
and he would rather recommend products that ship everywhere easily.

127
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,380
I want a company that is a bit more global,

128
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,780
so that, you know, no one wants to use my affiliate link to buy a supplement,

129
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,500
and then, you know, there's tariffs and, um, long delivery dates, etc.

130
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,980
So I'd rather have a supplement company,

131
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,740
if I'm gonna work with anyone,

132
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,420
that is a bit more global.

133
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,220
But I thought international globalists were the bad guys.

134
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,460
I'm beginning to think that nationalism doesn't work.

135
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,620
It's the leftists, you see.

136
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,900
Leftists love to project.

137
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,900
They think they see sexism everywhere.

138
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,060
Now here's a video about how Miley Cyrus is spreading degeneracy with her twerk.

139
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,540
Today I want to elaborate on something of utmost decadence,

140
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,100
and that is the transformation of Miley Cyrus.

141
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,100
The transformation which took place can serve as a metaphor

142
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,060
for what is being done to the Western women.

143
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,220
So they took this beautiful young feminine girl and turned her into this.

144
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,540
And like feminists, as third wave cultural Marxist feminists,

145
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,340
they are not concerned with the emancipation of women.

146
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:38,140
They honestly think this is a more powerful and prosperous and happy woman than this is.

147
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,300
That's right, that's what feminism wants.

148
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,700
Shut it down, girls.

149
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,060
The golden one's figured it out.

150
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,980
And no, I don't think it is anything that just happened out of thin air.

151
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,940
I think it was a plan of the, I don't know,

152
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,140
owners of Hollywood to take this beautiful girl and just reduce her.

153
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,860
A bit like in Batman where they take Harvey Dent,

154
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,580
the best and bravest of them, and reduce him to a murderer or something.

155
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh yeah, it's just like in Batman.

156
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh.

157
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,380
The patriarchy doesn't exist, but cultural Marxism is everywhere.

158
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,780
And look what it did to Hannah Montana.

159
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,860
We do not want to reduce our women into sex objects.

160
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,220
Yes, wouldn't it be terrible if your ideology reduced you to a sex object?

161
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,140
A short time after making a six-minute video about how a woman's provocative clothes

162
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,980
are threatening to destroy the precious Western civilization of tigers,

163
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,740
he seems to have realized that a lot of nationalists look like they hate women

164
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,420
and women having bodily autonomy.

165
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,740
I wonder where people get that impression.

166
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,340
Now, I've seen quite a bit of anti-female sentiments,

167
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,420
and this is something I wanted to address.

168
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,740
When 60% of women voted against Austria's far-right candidate in a recent election

169
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,900
and people were getting, you know, weird about it,

170
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,260
he put out a video trying to give his fellow true believers a word of advice.

171
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,060
And it really disturbs me, this sort of really severe anti-female rhetoric.

172
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,380
If you're a nationalist, you cannot harbor anti-female sentiments.

173
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,380
You see, there's a big difference between international womanry and the individual womanâ€”

174
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,060
Oh, no, wait, that's the other thing, sorry.

175
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,540
Nationalism means that you love your people,

176
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,220
and if you hate half of your people, then yeah, that's kind of not congruent with each other.

177
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,540
So if you're serious about being a nationalist, you cannot harbor anti-female sentiments.

178
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,420
What you can, however, do is, just like I,

179
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,620
have, you know, a major issue with degeneracy emanating from Hollywood

180
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,980
and the mainstream culture, and feminism.

181
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,380
Those are the sort of things we must combat.

182
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,220
Remember, kids, it's only okay to get angry at vague concepts like

183
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,980
degeneracy, feminism, and bad things.

184
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,460
I hate bad things the most, those are the worst.

185
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,700
Only nationalism can stop bad things.

186
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,540
Oh, fuck, this is hard.

187
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,540
Oh, Jesus Christ.

188
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,180
You're not gonna go for the guy who sits there like,

189
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,420
oh, all of these other people are so mean, and women, they are so stupid.

190
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,700
They will not vote for that guy, and you're actively pushing women away from the larger movement.

191
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,740
You're doing a disservice with all these anti-female sentiments.

192
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,740
Listen, mate, I don't want to harsh your buzzer or anything,

193
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,700
but I'm pretty sure the fact you have to remind your fellow nationalists that misogyny is bad

194
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,620
is pretty telling, don't you think?

195
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,660
You might want to consider that.

196
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,660
Drop the anti-female sentiments.

197
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,420
He's trying to advise his fellow white nationalists that it's not right to be pissed off at the

198
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,900
majority of women who voted against nationalism.

199
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,620
You're supposed to love your country and its people, after all.

200
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,500
This is really the core contradiction of nationalist populism,

201
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,620
and why complaints about cultural Marxism, or international Jews,

202
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,820
or leftist feminist corruption are so important to them.

203
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,940
Nationalists love to pretend they love their countries.

204
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,340
It's supposedly a core tenet of their beliefs.

205
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,820
But when you pay close attention to what they're saying,

206
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,540
you realize they hate almost everything about their country,

207
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,500
and even imagine made-up things to hate about it, too.

208
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,700
And isn't one of the central tenets of the West freedom?

209
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,300
You know, of choice, and of speech, to do and say what you want?

210
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,180
The existence of people who make radically different choices from you

211
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,060
is proof that society is free, not that it's broken.

212
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,580
The Golden One at least pretends to like freedom and democracy,

213
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,380
but believes there should only be one vote per household.

214
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,380
So he even thinks that individuals' right to vote should be taken away.

215
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,740
But how can a nationalist who supposedly loves Western civilization

216
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,780
reconcile this with their hatred for almost all of its freedoms

217
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
and the choices other people have made with them?

218
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,900
Simple.

219
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,980
They invent and fetishize an imaginary,

220
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,540
prelapsarian version of their country that never existed,

221
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,380
where everyone was strong and beautiful,

222
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,060
and acted how they wanted them to,

223
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,540
straight out of the good times before the fall in the Bible,

224
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,380
or any given fantasy novel.

225
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,620
They love this made-up version of their country,

226
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,860
not the actual country they live in.

227
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,420
But despite saying you're supposed to love your people,

228
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,940
he openly believes that people don't listen to reasonable arguments.

229
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,100
â€“ Everyone knows that I love fantasy.

230
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,020
I love Warhammer, and I love Lord of the Rings, Skyrim, The Witcher.

231
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,220
It's a pure fantasy that you think that you can just come in with these

232
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,700
reasonable arguments and change people's opinions.

233
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,460
Humans are not like that at all.

234
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,820
You can have, yeah, in the fantasy world,

235
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,380
a couple of elves sitting around having a reasonable discussion.

236
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,060
Humans aren't like that.

237
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,020
Women aren't like that.

238
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,060
Men aren't like that.

239
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,140
That doesn't sound like loving your people at all.

240
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,340
That sounds like you don't even trust them to think for themselves.

241
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,220
He's accidentally summed up nationalist populism better than me

242
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,140
by saying that he wishes life was a lot more like one of his fantasy books.

243
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,580
And that's not to say that liking fiction inherently makes you dumb, by the way.

244
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm bench-pressing a giant bag of Marvel comics right now.

245
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,740
It's not that liking fiction is inherently bad for you.

246
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,460
Quite the opposite.

247
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,180
It's important to be something of a dreamer, in my opinion.

248
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,660
It's just that if you allow works of fiction to fully comprise your

249
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,460
worldview of how the world should actually be,

250
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,540
that can have some dangerous external effects,

251
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,340
like supporting nationalism or dangerous neoliberalism

252
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,020
or liking the Marvel movies.

253
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,260
All three of those things are equally as bad.

254
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,580
Speaking of facts and evidence,

255
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,420
it kind of goes without saying that he's really,

256
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,660
really not very good at the whole evidence thing.

257
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,860
In a video entitled

258
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,540
Why Sex Was Better 100 Years Ago, Feminism and Porn Are Enemies,

259
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,220
he cites one article.

260
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,340
And there's been a study which proves that

261
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,100
people with right-wing views have better sex.

262
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,780
He doesn't show what website it's from, though,

263
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
seemingly cutting off the title on purpose,

264
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,100
as if he knows it'll give away it's false.

265
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,500
Also, even the Telegraph article points out that

266
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,020
the data shows that, in some places, it doesn't...

267
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,220
Look, basically, though, it's fucking bullshit, all right?

268
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,780
He doesn't link the survey or demonstrate an understanding

269
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,060
of the survey's methodologyâ€”

270
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,420
who does that remind you of?â€”

271
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,180
and concludes, based purely on this

272
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,660
and some of his cartoon elf-dwarf-dragon-man books,

273
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,300
that sex was better before feminism and porn.

274
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,220
And what we have to realize with sex, also,

275
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,620
is that it's not primarily a physically-pleasing activity.

276
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,380
Yeah, if you're bad at it!

277
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,980
Jesus fucking Christ!

278
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,420
First and foremost, we can discuss what sex is.

279
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,060
Sex is a transaction of power.

280
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Oh, talk dirty to me, golden one!

281
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,020
Oh, yeah!

282
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,220
Oh, it's getting good now!

283
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,020
Any wombs out there want to have a transaction of power?

284
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,820
Oh, Jesus, my fucking arms!

285
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,180
Now, however, he more or less needs the written permit

286
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,420
to initiate any sort of sexual contact

287
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,700
with his wife or girlfriend.

288
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,700
Obviously, I'm exaggerating, but you know what I mean.

289
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,020
You know, it kind of denigrates your position

290
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,500
when you admit that your example is exaggerated.

291
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,780
Like, oh, the states invaded our bedrooms

292
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,580
because we decided it was good to ask for consent.

293
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,100
It's Orwell's nightmare!

294
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,980
So, look, maybe this guy's ideas about sex and relationships

295
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,380
aren't very well-researched or based in reality,

296
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,780
but that hasn't stopped him from making, like, a dozen videos

297
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,260
on how to date women and talk to them

298
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,260
and act like a real manly man-man.

299
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,860
If I ever need any dating advice, and what are the odds of that,

300
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,100
I'll look you up, but right now I'm paggot.

301
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,500
All this exercise has made me thirsty.

302
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh.

303
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,060
Maybe he should stop reading quite so many fiction books,

304
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,380
and I don't just mean the ones with dragons in them,

305
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,580
and read some, like, actual books as well.

306
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,300
Eventually, he might get to Lucian David Meck's books

307
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,420
about wolf behavior.

308
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,300
That's right.

309
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,140
We're at the part of the video where I actually went away

310
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,820
and did some fucking research.

311
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,700
Now you're in my wheelhouse, motherfucker!

312
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,020
The Wolf, the Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species,

313
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,340
was the book which popularized the idea of

314
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,740
alpha-beta-pack mentality among wolves,

315
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,580
which MRAs like to pretend also happens in humans without any data.

316
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,340
But there's one problem.

317
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,180
A lot of the data Meck was drawing from

318
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,980
was based on wolf behavior in captivity.

319
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,580
You know, when you throw a bunch of captured wolves together

320
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,900
in a controlled space to see how they act.

321
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,860
It's appropriate to use the term alpha in an artificial pack

322
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,060
where, you know, you might put many wolves

323
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,900
from different assemblages together,

324
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
unrelated wolves and that kind of thing.

325
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
But that rarely happens in the wild, if ever.

326
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,780
Further research over the years,

327
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,820
including further books written by Meck afterwards,

328
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,780
show that in reality, the male and female leaders of a pack

329
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,140
are the leaders because they're the parents of the rest of the pack,

330
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,220
not because they're alphas who fought the hardest

331
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,300
and drank the most protein shakes.

332
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,980
So, not even wolves act like MRAs think people act.

333
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,060
There is, however, the hilarious side effect

334
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,620
that self-proclaimed alphas are effectively bragging

335
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,900
at how self-important they would act if you locked them in a cage.

336
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,380
Which is good to know, since, as you're well aware,

337
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,060
that's the goal of feminism.

338
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,740
And like all reasonable adults,

339
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,060
he likes to role-play the murder of people

340
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,300
who disagree with him in a video game.

341
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,260
Ah! Um...

342
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,940
How... how nice.

343
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,900
Open up this episode by killing this, uh...

344
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,020
this apprentice of the Frankfurt school.

345
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,260
No, I'm not kidding. He has this Let's Play of Skyrim

346
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,940
where he runs around killing dudes and says,

347
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,860
well, I guess they were a feminist.

348
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,260
Here's another one of those feminists

349
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,020
who don't believe in the patriarchy.

350
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,580
I've always felt pretty secure in my masculinity.

351
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,940
Please don't laugh.

352
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,260
But apparently, if I get any more secure,

353
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,940
if I get any more secure,

354
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,020
I'll start killing imaginary leftists in a video game.

355
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,020
This, uh, Hillary Clinton supporter

356
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,340
makes Skyrim great again.

357
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,180
It's important not to recognize this guy

358
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,180
as a dangerous threat to society.

359
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,140
He's really not.

360
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
He's a sad idiot seeking refuge

361
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,540
in obnoxious preening self-aggrandizement

362
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,500
for attention and to fabricate a sense of self-worth.

363
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,980
Sure, his ideas are ostensibly dangerous,

364
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,380
but he channels these ideas into the harmless place

365
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
of making dumb videos for the internet,

366
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,140
shilling cartoon fantasy novels,

367
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,700
and screaming about how great killing feminists is

368
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,580
over Skyrim.

369
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,020
This guy is a male feminist.

370
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,820
I honestly can't believe it.

371
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,540
Like, I don't likeâ€”

372
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,620
I don't like the idea that I'm strawmanning people,

373
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,740
and here he is going,

374
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,100
no, I'm made of straw.

375
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,540
I'm killing fake feminists.

376
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,500
And then I'm just gonnaâ€”

377
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,180
Ha ha ha ha ha!

378
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,020
It's very easy to convince yourself

379
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,460
this man is somehow dangerous,

380
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,620
but that's probably what he wants you to think.

381
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,780
That would make him worth paying attention to,

382
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,380
and you really shouldn't bother.

383
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,940
Sound and thunder don't often signify very much.

384
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,020
It's not a crime to be a psychotic weirdo

385
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,220
over video game footage,

386
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,500
and thank God for that.

387
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,060
If this is the best his philosophy has to offer,

388
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,300
then leftists like us have already won.

389
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
We've so fully cucked the alphas

390
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,580
that they sit at their computers

391
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,260
filming themselves playing video games

392
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,340
and ranting about how great their ideas would be

393
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,420
if they got around to doing anything.

394
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,660
I joked earlier about how alpha mentality

395
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,100
only formed in cages,

396
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,420
but look, it really has.

397
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,700
They caged themselves.

398
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,620
And, uh, by the way,

399
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,180
if you're annoyed that companies stop sponsoring you

400
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,580
because they don't like the implications

401
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,700
that your beliefs will have

402
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
on their product and its values,

403
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,380
you're not actually angry at leftists or degeneracy.

404
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,740
You're angry at the free market.

405
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,100
And now you're talking MY language!

406
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,740
Let's take society back for the people, comrade!

407
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,500
The only way we know how!

408
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,900
Us alphas! That's a thing that's real!

409
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,860
Well, it's been a very fun first year, friendos.

410
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,180
On top of the names scrolling past the screen right now,

411
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180

I'd also like to thank Max Woodhams for producing the music track I used for my opening theme

498
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,300
and then graciously giving me the mp3 after I heard it and insisted he let me use it.

499
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,660
I think he originally was going to use it for a piece of music that he never finished,

500
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,020
uh, so I'm really glad he let me just steal it and put it in my videos.

Pizza Gate is the stuff of nightmares.
