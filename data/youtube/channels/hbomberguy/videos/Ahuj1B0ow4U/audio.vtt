00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
Hello, true believers! In case you haven't noticed, it's been just over a full year

00:08.240 --> 00:12.600
since I started making videos more frequently after getting sick of having a real job and

00:12.600 --> 00:18.400
marketable skills. And to celebrate my one-year anniversary, ooh, uh, I'd like to take a

00:18.400 --> 00:20.320
look back at that first thing I made.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.880
I've always had a few criticisms of the Cultural Marxism video. It's very clear I'm poorly

00:24.880 --> 00:29.820
mastering audio recorded on a Blue Yeti in a very echoey spare room. What was I thinking

00:29.820 --> 00:33.820
with that hairstyle? And worst of all, I feel like I might have accidentally strawmanned

00:33.820 --> 00:37.660
some people. I directly compared everyone who talked about Cultural Marxists to the

00:37.660 --> 00:42.300
fascist literal Nazis who invented the term and the BNP youth who happened to include

00:42.300 --> 00:46.140
them in their list that happened to include even more direct antisemitism. And that's

00:46.140 --> 00:49.980
just not fair. Maybe I should go back and reassess some of these folks and see if there's

00:49.980 --> 00:52.340
a little more nuance to their beliefs.

00:52.340 --> 00:55.580
Let's check out the Golden One. What's he been up to these days? He made that video

00:55.580 --> 01:00.740
about how the Cultural Marxists are teaming up with the leftist Beatas to destroy the

01:00.740 --> 01:06.620
family using a sledgehammer and by demanding more medals. In April 2015, he's had even

01:06.620 --> 01:11.500
longer to develop creatively and intellectually than I have. So let's give this bloke another

01:11.500 --> 01:13.180
shot and see where his arguments have led him.

01:13.180 --> 01:24.860
["Hymne to the Red Army"]

01:29.500 --> 01:30.140
Oh!

01:34.300 --> 01:37.660
So after checking out his more recent work, the throughline hasn't really progressed in

01:37.660 --> 01:41.900
the year and change since his Cultural Marxism video. He's just got more overt about liking

01:41.980 --> 01:47.340
fascism and nationalism and being an alpha and not liking the leftist Beatas and Jews.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.860
Today I want to discuss the JQ, the Jewish question.

01:50.860 --> 01:55.580
Okay, now let's be clear here, folks. Mr. The Golden doesn't hate Jews per se.

01:55.580 --> 01:59.580
There is a large difference between the international Jewish community,

01:59.580 --> 02:03.820
or AKA international Jewry, and the Jewish individual.

02:03.820 --> 02:07.580
Oh, I see what he's going for here. He's not mad at individual Jews,

02:07.580 --> 02:13.020
just the vague conspiracy he made up that he also targets explicitly for its Jewishness.

02:13.020 --> 02:16.220
How could anyone confuse that with anti-Semitism?

02:16.220 --> 02:19.740
Now a lot of mere mortals with a pleb-tier understanding of the world say like,

02:19.740 --> 02:23.260
oh, Hitler hated Jews. Uh, no, he actually didn't.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.740
The Golden One then goes on to elaborate by explaining how Hitler wasn't an anti-Semite

02:27.740 --> 02:32.220
either and he was just doing the same th—oh. Oh, no.

02:33.180 --> 02:38.460
Hitler's battle was against international Jewry, international finance.

02:38.460 --> 02:42.540
That is what that was about. It was not some sort of ethnic hatred.

02:42.540 --> 02:45.340
Yeah, I'm sure all this imagery the Nazi propaganda machine put out

02:45.340 --> 02:48.700
actually has a really subtle point to make about international finance.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.900
How could he possibly be racist if he's not against physical Jews,

02:51.900 --> 02:55.900
but just the vague concept of bad people which he happens to keep calling Jews?

02:55.900 --> 03:00.940
That's not racism. It just looks like it, and sounds like it, and definitely is.

03:00.940 --> 03:05.420
I'm not downplaying the genetic component of the National Socialist Time.

03:05.420 --> 03:09.500
Alas, to focus on that part takes away the focus on the more interesting topic

03:09.500 --> 03:12.380
of international banking and a debt-based economy.

03:12.380 --> 03:15.980
I am interested in the Adolf Hitler due to his economic policies.

03:15.980 --> 03:18.700
I am not concerned with the racial policies.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.660
And he is kind of right. Hitler's economic policy was pretty good.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.940
He reduced unemployment by opening up lots of new job openings.

03:24.940 --> 03:27.260
I wonder how he did that!

03:27.260 --> 03:30.860
I think you can tell a lot about a person's true politics from their priorities.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.420
For example, this video where he spends eight minutes

03:33.420 --> 03:37.660
defending Richard Spencer's right to do the Sieg Heil salute without anyone judging him.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.580
And they say, you can't do this, what will I do then?

03:41.580 --> 03:44.860
Yes, I will say, you know what, fuck you, I'm gonna do whatever I want to do,

03:44.860 --> 03:47.660
and then I throw up my arm in a Roman salute.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.020
Freedom of speech is great precisely because when you look at someone

03:51.020 --> 03:55.900
and you see them choosing to use their freedom to defend the Hitler salute,

03:55.900 --> 03:57.580
you know who you're dealing with.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.060
I don't do it as a sign of hate to anyone.

04:00.060 --> 04:03.260
If you ever see me doing a Roman salute, it is not aimed at you.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.180
It is not a sign of hate to you.

04:05.180 --> 04:08.300
It's a sign for me to say to myself and to everyone else,

04:08.300 --> 04:11.260
and especially to the establishment, that, you know what, you have no power over me.

04:11.900 --> 04:16.220
If you have to keep telling people with the Hitler salute

04:16.220 --> 04:19.980
that you don't care what they think about you, then you do.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.060
You know that kid in high school who would go around constantly telling everyone

04:24.060 --> 04:25.980
that he doesn't care what they think about him,

04:25.980 --> 04:28.220
almost as if he cares a little bit too much?

04:28.220 --> 04:33.500
I'm getting that same weird insecurity vibe, but from a 26-year-old bodybuilder,

04:33.500 --> 04:34.940
and that's just a bit sad.

04:35.980 --> 04:37.820
The flexing thing wasn't a one-off, by the way.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.500
He opens a lot of videos like that.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.060
Greetings, true friends.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.980
You can tell this guy's not a feminist because, well, it was a Nazi,

04:51.980 --> 04:55.340
but also because he seems to love to objectify himself

04:55.340 --> 04:58.860
and reduce himself to just a body, you know?

04:58.860 --> 05:01.980
Which, to be fair, is a little bit easier than forming a personality.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.540
I mean, if the ideas you spout aren't very good,

05:04.540 --> 05:06.380
you might as well look good doing it, right?

05:06.380 --> 05:24.860
I've always wanted to be on the front cover of a Chuck Tingle book,

05:24.860 --> 05:29.100
and thanks to the inspirational words of a Swedish racist, I'm well on my way.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.420
Ha ha, ah, ha ha, ah!

05:33.420 --> 05:38.700
While I'm pumping my lats, or my tris, or whatever this bit is,

05:38.700 --> 05:39.820
let's check out his website.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.460
TheGoldenOne.se.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.380
Honor the gods.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.660
Love your woman.

05:45.660 --> 05:47.020
Defend your country.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.740
Check out my Instagram!

05:49.740 --> 05:52.460
Oh, boy, the Golden One's reading list.

05:52.460 --> 05:55.020
Oh, hey, he's read the Way of Men by Jack Donovan,

05:55.020 --> 05:57.340
or at least posed with it in front of his...

05:57.340 --> 05:58.860
arm...sep.

05:58.860 --> 06:01.020
I wonder where he saw that book being advertised.

06:01.820 --> 06:05.500
Oh, oh, yeah, Western Civilization bites back,

06:05.500 --> 06:07.740
because when I think of Western Civilization,

06:07.740 --> 06:11.740
I personify it as animals from Africa that never founded a society,

06:11.740 --> 06:13.820
or built any houses.

06:13.820 --> 06:16.940
Last I checked, tigers haven't even learned how to open Etsy stores yet.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.660
Wow, uh, a lot of fiction books about made-up fantasy battles here.

06:21.660 --> 06:25.420
Lots of, uh, fake magic wars going on in the Golden One's library.

06:25.420 --> 06:26.940
Not a lot of political philosophy...

06:27.900 --> 06:28.860
or any.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.860
He used to be sponsored by various products,

06:30.860 --> 06:34.540
but as they slowly realized that he's a complete monster,

06:34.540 --> 06:36.060
they dropped their sponsorship.

06:36.060 --> 06:39.420
And he has some very strong words to say about the Jews behind this.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.700
I mean, I mean, it's not the Je-

06:40.700 --> 06:41.660
I'm not racist!

06:41.660 --> 06:43.420
Mark Lobliner, he's Jewish,

06:43.420 --> 06:46.780
but he has never said anything against my political views.

06:46.780 --> 06:48.780
And I see so many people, you know,

06:48.780 --> 06:51.580
coming with anti-Jewish sentiments towards him

06:51.580 --> 06:54.380
just because he is, uh, Jewish.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.540
And now, realize this,

06:56.540 --> 07:01.260
that there is a huge difference between the Internationale Klicke,

07:01.260 --> 07:02.060
a.k.a. Global-

07:02.060 --> 07:03.580
Hang on, is he doing the speech again?

07:03.580 --> 07:04.860
Is he doing the exact same-

07:04.860 --> 07:05.660
Hang on, wait a second.

07:09.100 --> 07:09.580
Weird.

07:09.580 --> 07:13.340
He has to keep reminding his people it's not right to be anti-Semitic.

07:14.540 --> 07:18.460
Almost as if nationalism and racism come from the same place.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.260
Almost.

07:21.260 --> 07:24.300
He later goes on to say he didn't like how the product was American-made,

07:24.300 --> 07:25.420
so there were shipping costs,

07:25.420 --> 07:28.220
and he would rather recommend products that ship everywhere easily.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.380
I want a company that is a bit more global,

07:30.380 --> 07:34.780
so that, you know, no one wants to use my affiliate link to buy a supplement,

07:34.780 --> 07:39.500
and then, you know, there's tariffs and, um, long delivery dates, etc.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.980
So I'd rather have a supplement company,

07:41.980 --> 07:43.740
if I'm gonna work with anyone,

07:43.740 --> 07:45.420
that is a bit more global.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.220
But I thought international globalists were the bad guys.

07:48.940 --> 07:52.460
I'm beginning to think that nationalism doesn't work.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.620
It's the leftists, you see.

07:54.620 --> 07:55.900
Leftists love to project.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.900
They think they see sexism everywhere.

07:57.900 --> 08:02.060
Now here's a video about how Miley Cyrus is spreading degeneracy with her twerk.

08:02.060 --> 08:06.540
Today I want to elaborate on something of utmost decadence,

08:06.540 --> 08:11.100
and that is the transformation of Miley Cyrus.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.100
The transformation which took place can serve as a metaphor

08:15.100 --> 08:18.060
for what is being done to the Western women.

08:18.140 --> 08:24.220
So they took this beautiful young feminine girl and turned her into this.

08:24.220 --> 08:28.540
And like feminists, as third wave cultural Marxist feminists,

08:28.540 --> 08:31.340
they are not concerned with the emancipation of women.

08:31.340 --> 08:38.140
They honestly think this is a more powerful and prosperous and happy woman than this is.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.300
That's right, that's what feminism wants.

08:41.420 --> 08:42.700
Shut it down, girls.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.060
The golden one's figured it out.

08:44.060 --> 08:47.980
And no, I don't think it is anything that just happened out of thin air.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.940
I think it was a plan of the, I don't know,

08:50.940 --> 08:56.140
owners of Hollywood to take this beautiful girl and just reduce her.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.860
A bit like in Batman where they take Harvey Dent,

08:58.860 --> 09:03.580
the best and bravest of them, and reduce him to a murderer or something.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.900
Oh yeah, it's just like in Batman.

09:06.380 --> 09:06.880
Oh.

09:10.380 --> 09:14.380
The patriarchy doesn't exist, but cultural Marxism is everywhere.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.780
And look what it did to Hannah Montana.

09:16.780 --> 09:20.860
We do not want to reduce our women into sex objects.

09:20.860 --> 09:26.220
Yes, wouldn't it be terrible if your ideology reduced you to a sex object?

09:26.220 --> 09:30.140
A short time after making a six-minute video about how a woman's provocative clothes

09:30.140 --> 09:33.980
are threatening to destroy the precious Western civilization of tigers,

09:33.980 --> 09:37.740
he seems to have realized that a lot of nationalists look like they hate women

09:37.740 --> 09:39.420
and women having bodily autonomy.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.740
I wonder where people get that impression.

09:41.740 --> 09:45.340
Now, I've seen quite a bit of anti-female sentiments,

09:45.340 --> 09:47.420
and this is something I wanted to address.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.740
When 60% of women voted against Austria's far-right candidate in a recent election

09:51.740 --> 09:53.900
and people were getting, you know, weird about it,

09:53.900 --> 09:57.260
he put out a video trying to give his fellow true believers a word of advice.

09:57.260 --> 10:02.060
And it really disturbs me, this sort of really severe anti-female rhetoric.

10:02.060 --> 10:06.380
If you're a nationalist, you cannot harbor anti-female sentiments.

10:06.380 --> 10:12.380
You see, there's a big difference between international womanry and the individual woman—

10:12.380 --> 10:14.060
Oh, no, wait, that's the other thing, sorry.

10:14.060 --> 10:16.540
Nationalism means that you love your people,

10:16.540 --> 10:22.220
and if you hate half of your people, then yeah, that's kind of not congruent with each other.

10:22.220 --> 10:26.540
So if you're serious about being a nationalist, you cannot harbor anti-female sentiments.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.420
What you can, however, do is, just like I,

10:29.420 --> 10:34.620
have, you know, a major issue with degeneracy emanating from Hollywood

10:34.620 --> 10:37.980
and the mainstream culture, and feminism.

10:37.980 --> 10:40.380
Those are the sort of things we must combat.

10:40.380 --> 10:44.220
Remember, kids, it's only okay to get angry at vague concepts like

10:44.220 --> 10:47.980
degeneracy, feminism, and bad things.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.460
I hate bad things the most, those are the worst.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.700
Only nationalism can stop bad things.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.540
Oh, fuck, this is hard.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.540
Oh, Jesus Christ.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.180
You're not gonna go for the guy who sits there like,

10:59.180 --> 11:03.420
oh, all of these other people are so mean, and women, they are so stupid.

11:03.420 --> 11:08.700
They will not vote for that guy, and you're actively pushing women away from the larger movement.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.740
You're doing a disservice with all these anti-female sentiments.

11:12.780 --> 11:15.740
Listen, mate, I don't want to harsh your buzzer or anything,

11:15.740 --> 11:20.700
but I'm pretty sure the fact you have to remind your fellow nationalists that misogyny is bad

11:20.700 --> 11:22.620
is pretty telling, don't you think?

11:22.620 --> 11:23.660
You might want to consider that.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.660
Drop the anti-female sentiments.

11:27.660 --> 11:31.420
He's trying to advise his fellow white nationalists that it's not right to be pissed off at the

11:31.420 --> 11:33.900
majority of women who voted against nationalism.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.620
You're supposed to love your country and its people, after all.

11:36.620 --> 11:39.500
This is really the core contradiction of nationalist populism,

11:39.500 --> 11:42.620
and why complaints about cultural Marxism, or international Jews,

11:42.620 --> 11:45.820
or leftist feminist corruption are so important to them.

11:45.820 --> 11:48.940
Nationalists love to pretend they love their countries.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.340
It's supposedly a core tenet of their beliefs.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.820
But when you pay close attention to what they're saying,

11:53.900 --> 11:56.540
you realize they hate almost everything about their country,

11:56.540 --> 11:59.500
and even imagine made-up things to hate about it, too.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.700
And isn't one of the central tenets of the West freedom?

12:02.700 --> 12:06.300
You know, of choice, and of speech, to do and say what you want?

12:06.300 --> 12:09.180
The existence of people who make radically different choices from you

12:09.180 --> 12:12.060
is proof that society is free, not that it's broken.

12:12.620 --> 12:15.580
The Golden One at least pretends to like freedom and democracy,

12:15.580 --> 12:18.380
but believes there should only be one vote per household.

12:18.380 --> 12:22.380
So he even thinks that individuals' right to vote should be taken away.

12:22.380 --> 12:25.740
But how can a nationalist who supposedly loves Western civilization

12:25.740 --> 12:28.780
reconcile this with their hatred for almost all of its freedoms

12:28.780 --> 12:30.780
and the choices other people have made with them?

12:31.340 --> 12:31.900
Simple.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.980
They invent and fetishize an imaginary,

12:33.980 --> 12:36.540
prelapsarian version of their country that never existed,

12:36.540 --> 12:38.380
where everyone was strong and beautiful,

12:38.380 --> 12:40.060
and acted how they wanted them to,

12:40.060 --> 12:42.540
straight out of the good times before the fall in the Bible,

12:42.540 --> 12:44.380
or any given fantasy novel.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.620
They love this made-up version of their country,

12:46.620 --> 12:48.860
not the actual country they live in.

12:48.860 --> 12:51.420
But despite saying you're supposed to love your people,

12:51.420 --> 12:54.940
he openly believes that people don't listen to reasonable arguments.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.100
– Everyone knows that I love fantasy.

12:57.100 --> 13:01.020
I love Warhammer, and I love Lord of the Rings, Skyrim, The Witcher.

13:01.900 --> 13:06.220
It's a pure fantasy that you think that you can just come in with these

13:07.660 --> 13:10.700
reasonable arguments and change people's opinions.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.460
Humans are not like that at all.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.820
You can have, yeah, in the fantasy world,

13:13.820 --> 13:16.380
a couple of elves sitting around having a reasonable discussion.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.060
Humans aren't like that.

13:18.060 --> 13:19.020
Women aren't like that.

13:19.020 --> 13:20.060
Men aren't like that.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.140
That doesn't sound like loving your people at all.

13:22.140 --> 13:25.340
That sounds like you don't even trust them to think for themselves.

13:25.340 --> 13:28.220
He's accidentally summed up nationalist populism better than me

13:28.220 --> 13:32.140
by saying that he wishes life was a lot more like one of his fantasy books.

13:32.140 --> 13:35.580
And that's not to say that liking fiction inherently makes you dumb, by the way.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.380
I'm bench-pressing a giant bag of Marvel comics right now.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.740
It's not that liking fiction is inherently bad for you.

13:47.740 --> 13:48.460
Quite the opposite.

13:48.460 --> 13:51.180
It's important to be something of a dreamer, in my opinion.

13:51.180 --> 13:55.660
It's just that if you allow works of fiction to fully comprise your

13:55.660 --> 13:58.460
worldview of how the world should actually be,

13:58.460 --> 14:00.540
that can have some dangerous external effects,

14:00.540 --> 14:05.340
like supporting nationalism or dangerous neoliberalism

14:05.340 --> 14:07.020
or liking the Marvel movies.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.260
All three of those things are equally as bad.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.580
Speaking of facts and evidence,

14:11.580 --> 14:13.420
it kind of goes without saying that he's really,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.660
really not very good at the whole evidence thing.

14:15.740 --> 14:16.860
In a video entitled

14:16.860 --> 14:20.540
Why Sex Was Better 100 Years Ago, Feminism and Porn Are Enemies,

14:20.540 --> 14:22.220
he cites one article.

14:22.220 --> 14:25.340
And there's been a study which proves that

14:25.340 --> 14:29.100
people with right-wing views have better sex.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.780
He doesn't show what website it's from, though,

14:30.780 --> 14:32.780
seemingly cutting off the title on purpose,

14:32.780 --> 14:35.100
as if he knows it'll give away it's false.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.500
Also, even the Telegraph article points out that

14:37.500 --> 14:41.020
the data shows that, in some places, it doesn't...

14:42.060 --> 14:44.220
Look, basically, though, it's fucking bullshit, all right?

14:44.220 --> 14:46.780
He doesn't link the survey or demonstrate an understanding

14:46.780 --> 14:48.060
of the survey's methodology—

14:48.060 --> 14:49.420
who does that remind you of?—

14:49.420 --> 14:51.180
and concludes, based purely on this

14:51.180 --> 14:53.660
and some of his cartoon elf-dwarf-dragon-man books,

14:53.660 --> 14:56.300
that sex was better before feminism and porn.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.220
And what we have to realize with sex, also,

14:58.220 --> 15:02.620
is that it's not primarily a physically-pleasing activity.

15:03.260 --> 15:04.380
Yeah, if you're bad at it!

15:04.380 --> 15:05.980
Jesus fucking Christ!

15:06.620 --> 15:09.420
First and foremost, we can discuss what sex is.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.060
Sex is a transaction of power.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.060
Oh, talk dirty to me, golden one!

15:14.060 --> 15:15.020
Oh, yeah!

15:15.020 --> 15:16.220
Oh, it's getting good now!

15:18.220 --> 15:21.020
Any wombs out there want to have a transaction of power?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.820
Oh, Jesus, my fucking arms!

15:23.820 --> 15:29.180
Now, however, he more or less needs the written permit

15:29.180 --> 15:31.420
to initiate any sort of sexual contact

15:31.420 --> 15:32.700
with his wife or girlfriend.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.700
Obviously, I'm exaggerating, but you know what I mean.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.020
You know, it kind of denigrates your position

15:39.020 --> 15:41.500
when you admit that your example is exaggerated.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.780
Like, oh, the states invaded our bedrooms

15:44.780 --> 15:47.580
because we decided it was good to ask for consent.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.100
It's Orwell's nightmare!

15:49.100 --> 15:51.980
So, look, maybe this guy's ideas about sex and relationships

15:51.980 --> 15:54.380
aren't very well-researched or based in reality,

15:54.380 --> 15:56.780
but that hasn't stopped him from making, like, a dozen videos

15:56.780 --> 15:59.260
on how to date women and talk to them

15:59.260 --> 16:01.260
and act like a real manly man-man.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.860
If I ever need any dating advice, and what are the odds of that,

16:04.860 --> 16:07.100
I'll look you up, but right now I'm paggot.

16:07.740 --> 16:09.500
All this exercise has made me thirsty.

16:10.380 --> 16:10.880
Oh.

16:14.780 --> 16:18.060
Maybe he should stop reading quite so many fiction books,

16:18.060 --> 16:20.380
and I don't just mean the ones with dragons in them,

16:20.380 --> 16:23.580
and read some, like, actual books as well.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.300
Eventually, he might get to Lucian David Meck's books

16:26.300 --> 16:27.420
about wolf behavior.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.300
That's right.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.140
We're at the part of the video where I actually went away

16:32.140 --> 16:33.820
and did some fucking research.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.700
Now you're in my wheelhouse, motherfucker!

16:37.180 --> 16:41.020
The Wolf, the Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species,

16:41.020 --> 16:43.340
was the book which popularized the idea of

16:43.340 --> 16:45.740
alpha-beta-pack mentality among wolves,

16:45.740 --> 16:49.580
which MRAs like to pretend also happens in humans without any data.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.340
But there's one problem.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.180
A lot of the data Meck was drawing from

16:53.180 --> 16:55.980
was based on wolf behavior in captivity.

16:55.980 --> 16:59.580
You know, when you throw a bunch of captured wolves together

16:59.580 --> 17:01.900
in a controlled space to see how they act.

17:01.900 --> 17:06.860
It's appropriate to use the term alpha in an artificial pack

17:06.860 --> 17:10.060
where, you know, you might put many wolves

17:10.060 --> 17:11.900
from different assemblages together,

17:11.900 --> 17:13.900
unrelated wolves and that kind of thing.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.700
But that rarely happens in the wild, if ever.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.780
Further research over the years,

17:18.780 --> 17:21.820
including further books written by Meck afterwards,

17:21.820 --> 17:24.780
show that in reality, the male and female leaders of a pack

17:24.780 --> 17:28.140
are the leaders because they're the parents of the rest of the pack,

17:28.140 --> 17:30.220
not because they're alphas who fought the hardest

17:30.220 --> 17:32.300
and drank the most protein shakes.

17:32.300 --> 17:35.980
So, not even wolves act like MRAs think people act.

17:35.980 --> 17:38.060
There is, however, the hilarious side effect

17:38.060 --> 17:40.620
that self-proclaimed alphas are effectively bragging

17:40.620 --> 17:43.900
at how self-important they would act if you locked them in a cage.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.380
Which is good to know, since, as you're well aware,

17:46.380 --> 17:48.060
that's the goal of feminism.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.740
And like all reasonable adults,

17:49.740 --> 17:52.060
he likes to role-play the murder of people

17:52.060 --> 17:54.300
who disagree with him in a video game.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.260
Ah! Um...

17:57.260 --> 17:58.940
How... how nice.

17:58.940 --> 18:01.900
Open up this episode by killing this, uh...

18:01.900 --> 18:05.020
this apprentice of the Frankfurt school.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.260
No, I'm not kidding. He has this Let's Play of Skyrim

18:07.260 --> 18:08.940
where he runs around killing dudes and says,

18:08.940 --> 18:10.860
well, I guess they were a feminist.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.260
Here's another one of those feminists

18:13.260 --> 18:15.020
who don't believe in the patriarchy.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.580
I've always felt pretty secure in my masculinity.

18:17.580 --> 18:18.940
Please don't laugh.

18:18.940 --> 18:21.260
But apparently, if I get any more secure,

18:21.260 --> 18:22.940
if I get any more secure,

18:22.940 --> 18:27.020
I'll start killing imaginary leftists in a video game.

18:28.700 --> 18:31.020
This, uh, Hillary Clinton supporter

18:31.020 --> 18:33.340
makes Skyrim great again.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.180
It's important not to recognize this guy

18:35.180 --> 18:37.180
as a dangerous threat to society.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.140
He's really not.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.140
He's a sad idiot seeking refuge

18:40.140 --> 18:42.540
in obnoxious preening self-aggrandizement

18:42.540 --> 18:45.500
for attention and to fabricate a sense of self-worth.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.980
Sure, his ideas are ostensibly dangerous,

18:47.980 --> 18:50.380
but he channels these ideas into the harmless place

18:50.380 --> 18:52.380
of making dumb videos for the internet,

18:52.380 --> 18:54.140
shilling cartoon fantasy novels,

18:54.140 --> 18:56.700
and screaming about how great killing feminists is

18:56.700 --> 18:57.580
over Skyrim.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.020
This guy is a male feminist.

19:02.380 --> 19:03.820
I honestly can't believe it.

19:03.820 --> 19:06.540
Like, I don't like—

19:06.540 --> 19:08.620
I don't like the idea that I'm strawmanning people,

19:08.620 --> 19:09.740
and here he is going,

19:09.740 --> 19:11.100
no, I'm made of straw.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.540
I'm killing fake feminists.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.500
And then I'm just gonna—

19:13.500 --> 19:15.180
Ha ha ha ha ha!

19:15.180 --> 19:17.020
It's very easy to convince yourself

19:17.020 --> 19:18.460
this man is somehow dangerous,

19:18.460 --> 19:20.620
but that's probably what he wants you to think.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.780
That would make him worth paying attention to,

19:22.780 --> 19:24.380
and you really shouldn't bother.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.940
Sound and thunder don't often signify very much.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.020
It's not a crime to be a psychotic weirdo

19:29.020 --> 19:30.220
over video game footage,

19:30.220 --> 19:31.500
and thank God for that.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.060
If this is the best his philosophy has to offer,

19:34.060 --> 19:36.300
then leftists like us have already won.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.300
We've so fully cucked the alphas

19:38.300 --> 19:39.580
that they sit at their computers

19:39.580 --> 19:41.260
filming themselves playing video games

19:41.260 --> 19:43.340
and ranting about how great their ideas would be

19:43.340 --> 19:45.420
if they got around to doing anything.

19:45.420 --> 19:47.660
I joked earlier about how alpha mentality

19:47.660 --> 19:49.100
only formed in cages,

19:49.100 --> 19:51.420
but look, it really has.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.700
They caged themselves.

19:53.340 --> 19:54.620
And, uh, by the way,

19:54.620 --> 19:57.180
if you're annoyed that companies stop sponsoring you

19:57.180 --> 19:59.580
because they don't like the implications

19:59.580 --> 20:00.700
that your beliefs will have

20:00.700 --> 20:02.700
on their product and its values,

20:02.700 --> 20:06.380
you're not actually angry at leftists or degeneracy.

20:06.380 --> 20:07.740
You're angry at the free market.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.100
And now you're talking MY language!

20:11.100 --> 20:13.740
Let's take society back for the people, comrade!

20:13.740 --> 20:15.500
The only way we know how!

20:15.500 --> 20:17.900
Us alphas! That's a thing that's real!

20:34.460 --> 20:36.860
Well, it's been a very fun first year, friendos.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.180
On top of the names scrolling past the screen right now,

20:39.180 --> 20:41.180

I'd also like to thank Max Woodhams for producing the music track I used for my opening theme

22:31.980 --> 22:36.300
and then graciously giving me the mp3 after I heard it and insisted he let me use it.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.660
I think he originally was going to use it for a piece of music that he never finished,

22:39.660 --> 22:43.020
uh, so I'm really glad he let me just steal it and put it in my videos.
