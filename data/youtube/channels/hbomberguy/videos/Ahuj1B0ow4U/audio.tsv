0	8240	Hello, true believers! In case you haven't noticed, it's been just over a full year
8240	12600	since I started making videos more frequently after getting sick of having a real job and
12600	18400	marketable skills. And to celebrate my one-year anniversary, ooh, uh, I'd like to take a
18400	20320	look back at that first thing I made.
20320	24880	I've always had a few criticisms of the Cultural Marxism video. It's very clear I'm poorly
24880	29820	mastering audio recorded on a Blue Yeti in a very echoey spare room. What was I thinking
29820	33820	with that hairstyle? And worst of all, I feel like I might have accidentally strawmanned
33820	37660	some people. I directly compared everyone who talked about Cultural Marxists to the
37660	42300	fascist literal Nazis who invented the term and the BNP youth who happened to include
42300	46140	them in their list that happened to include even more direct antisemitism. And that's
46140	49980	just not fair. Maybe I should go back and reassess some of these folks and see if there's
49980	52340	a little more nuance to their beliefs.
52340	55580	Let's check out the Golden One. What's he been up to these days? He made that video
55580	60740	about how the Cultural Marxists are teaming up with the leftist Beatas to destroy the
60740	66620	family using a sledgehammer and by demanding more medals. In April 2015, he's had even
66620	71500	longer to develop creatively and intellectually than I have. So let's give this bloke another
71500	73180	shot and see where his arguments have led him.
73180	84860	["Hymne to the Red Army"]
89500	90140	Oh!
94300	97660	So after checking out his more recent work, the throughline hasn't really progressed in
97660	101900	the year and change since his Cultural Marxism video. He's just got more overt about liking
101980	107340	fascism and nationalism and being an alpha and not liking the leftist Beatas and Jews.
107340	110860	Today I want to discuss the JQ, the Jewish question.
110860	115580	Okay, now let's be clear here, folks. Mr. The Golden doesn't hate Jews per se.
115580	119580	There is a large difference between the international Jewish community,
119580	123820	or AKA international Jewry, and the Jewish individual.
123820	127580	Oh, I see what he's going for here. He's not mad at individual Jews,
127580	133020	just the vague conspiracy he made up that he also targets explicitly for its Jewishness.
133020	136220	How could anyone confuse that with anti-Semitism?
136220	139740	Now a lot of mere mortals with a pleb-tier understanding of the world say like,
139740	143260	oh, Hitler hated Jews. Uh, no, he actually didn't.
143260	147740	The Golden One then goes on to elaborate by explaining how Hitler wasn't an anti-Semite
147740	152220	either and he was just doing the same th—oh. Oh, no.
153180	158460	Hitler's battle was against international Jewry, international finance.
158460	162540	That is what that was about. It was not some sort of ethnic hatred.
162540	165340	Yeah, I'm sure all this imagery the Nazi propaganda machine put out
165340	168700	actually has a really subtle point to make about international finance.
168700	171900	How could he possibly be racist if he's not against physical Jews,
171900	175900	but just the vague concept of bad people which he happens to keep calling Jews?
175900	180940	That's not racism. It just looks like it, and sounds like it, and definitely is.
180940	185420	I'm not downplaying the genetic component of the National Socialist Time.
185420	189500	Alas, to focus on that part takes away the focus on the more interesting topic
189500	192380	of international banking and a debt-based economy.
192380	195980	I am interested in the Adolf Hitler due to his economic policies.
195980	198700	I am not concerned with the racial policies.
198700	201660	And he is kind of right. Hitler's economic policy was pretty good.
201660	204940	He reduced unemployment by opening up lots of new job openings.
204940	207260	I wonder how he did that!
207260	210860	I think you can tell a lot about a person's true politics from their priorities.
210860	213420	For example, this video where he spends eight minutes
213420	217660	defending Richard Spencer's right to do the Sieg Heil salute without anyone judging him.
218300	221580	And they say, you can't do this, what will I do then?
221580	224860	Yes, I will say, you know what, fuck you, I'm gonna do whatever I want to do,
224860	227660	and then I throw up my arm in a Roman salute.
227660	231020	Freedom of speech is great precisely because when you look at someone
231020	235900	and you see them choosing to use their freedom to defend the Hitler salute,
235900	237580	you know who you're dealing with.
237580	240060	I don't do it as a sign of hate to anyone.
240060	243260	If you ever see me doing a Roman salute, it is not aimed at you.
243260	245180	It is not a sign of hate to you.
245180	248300	It's a sign for me to say to myself and to everyone else,
248300	251260	and especially to the establishment, that, you know what, you have no power over me.
251900	256220	If you have to keep telling people with the Hitler salute
256220	259980	that you don't care what they think about you, then you do.
260940	264060	You know that kid in high school who would go around constantly telling everyone
264060	265980	that he doesn't care what they think about him,
265980	268220	almost as if he cares a little bit too much?
268220	273500	I'm getting that same weird insecurity vibe, but from a 26-year-old bodybuilder,
273500	274940	and that's just a bit sad.
275980	277820	The flexing thing wasn't a one-off, by the way.
277820	279500	He opens a lot of videos like that.
286220	288060	Greetings, true friends.
288780	291980	You can tell this guy's not a feminist because, well, it was a Nazi,
291980	295340	but also because he seems to love to objectify himself
295340	298860	and reduce himself to just a body, you know?
298860	301980	Which, to be fair, is a little bit easier than forming a personality.
302700	304540	I mean, if the ideas you spout aren't very good,
304540	306380	you might as well look good doing it, right?
306380	324860	I've always wanted to be on the front cover of a Chuck Tingle book,
324860	329100	and thanks to the inspirational words of a Swedish racist, I'm well on my way.
329100	333420	Ha ha, ah, ha ha, ah!
333420	338700	While I'm pumping my lats, or my tris, or whatever this bit is,
338700	339820	let's check out his website.
340860	342460	TheGoldenOne.se.
343100	344380	Honor the gods.
344380	345660	Love your woman.
345660	347020	Defend your country.
347900	349740	Check out my Instagram!
349740	352460	Oh, boy, the Golden One's reading list.
352460	355020	Oh, hey, he's read the Way of Men by Jack Donovan,
355020	357340	or at least posed with it in front of his...
357340	358860	arm...sep.
358860	361020	I wonder where he saw that book being advertised.
361820	365500	Oh, oh, yeah, Western Civilization bites back,
365500	367740	because when I think of Western Civilization,
367740	371740	I personify it as animals from Africa that never founded a society,
371740	373820	or built any houses.
373820	376940	Last I checked, tigers haven't even learned how to open Etsy stores yet.
377500	381660	Wow, uh, a lot of fiction books about made-up fantasy battles here.
381660	385420	Lots of, uh, fake magic wars going on in the Golden One's library.
385420	386940	Not a lot of political philosophy...
387900	388860	or any.
388860	390860	He used to be sponsored by various products,
390860	394540	but as they slowly realized that he's a complete monster,
394540	396060	they dropped their sponsorship.
396060	399420	And he has some very strong words to say about the Jews behind this.
399420	400700	I mean, I mean, it's not the Je-
400700	401660	I'm not racist!
401660	403420	Mark Lobliner, he's Jewish,
403420	406780	but he has never said anything against my political views.
406780	408780	And I see so many people, you know,
408780	411580	coming with anti-Jewish sentiments towards him
411580	414380	just because he is, uh, Jewish.
415100	416540	And now, realize this,
416540	421260	that there is a huge difference between the Internationale Klicke,
421260	422060	a.k.a. Global-
422060	423580	Hang on, is he doing the speech again?
423580	424860	Is he doing the exact same-
424860	425660	Hang on, wait a second.
429100	429580	Weird.
429580	433340	He has to keep reminding his people it's not right to be anti-Semitic.
434540	438460	Almost as if nationalism and racism come from the same place.
440060	441260	Almost.
441260	444300	He later goes on to say he didn't like how the product was American-made,
444300	445420	so there were shipping costs,
445420	448220	and he would rather recommend products that ship everywhere easily.
448220	450380	I want a company that is a bit more global,
450380	454780	so that, you know, no one wants to use my affiliate link to buy a supplement,
454780	459500	and then, you know, there's tariffs and, um, long delivery dates, etc.
459500	461980	So I'd rather have a supplement company,
461980	463740	if I'm gonna work with anyone,
463740	465420	that is a bit more global.
465420	468220	But I thought international globalists were the bad guys.
468940	472460	I'm beginning to think that nationalism doesn't work.
473100	474620	It's the leftists, you see.
474620	475900	Leftists love to project.
475900	477900	They think they see sexism everywhere.
477900	482060	Now here's a video about how Miley Cyrus is spreading degeneracy with her twerk.
482060	486540	Today I want to elaborate on something of utmost decadence,
486540	491100	and that is the transformation of Miley Cyrus.
491100	495100	The transformation which took place can serve as a metaphor
495100	498060	for what is being done to the Western women.
498140	504220	So they took this beautiful young feminine girl and turned her into this.
504220	508540	And like feminists, as third wave cultural Marxist feminists,
508540	511340	they are not concerned with the emancipation of women.
511340	518140	They honestly think this is a more powerful and prosperous and happy woman than this is.
518140	520300	That's right, that's what feminism wants.
521420	522700	Shut it down, girls.
522700	524060	The golden one's figured it out.
524060	527980	And no, I don't think it is anything that just happened out of thin air.
527980	530940	I think it was a plan of the, I don't know,
530940	536140	owners of Hollywood to take this beautiful girl and just reduce her.
536140	538860	A bit like in Batman where they take Harvey Dent,
538860	543580	the best and bravest of them, and reduce him to a murderer or something.
543580	545900	Oh yeah, it's just like in Batman.
546380	546880	Oh.
550380	554380	The patriarchy doesn't exist, but cultural Marxism is everywhere.
554380	556780	And look what it did to Hannah Montana.
556780	560860	We do not want to reduce our women into sex objects.
560860	566220	Yes, wouldn't it be terrible if your ideology reduced you to a sex object?
566220	570140	A short time after making a six-minute video about how a woman's provocative clothes
570140	573980	are threatening to destroy the precious Western civilization of tigers,
573980	577740	he seems to have realized that a lot of nationalists look like they hate women
577740	579420	and women having bodily autonomy.
579420	581740	I wonder where people get that impression.
581740	585340	Now, I've seen quite a bit of anti-female sentiments,
585340	587420	and this is something I wanted to address.
587420	591740	When 60% of women voted against Austria's far-right candidate in a recent election
591740	593900	and people were getting, you know, weird about it,
593900	597260	he put out a video trying to give his fellow true believers a word of advice.
597260	602060	And it really disturbs me, this sort of really severe anti-female rhetoric.
602060	606380	If you're a nationalist, you cannot harbor anti-female sentiments.
606380	612380	You see, there's a big difference between international womanry and the individual woman—
612380	614060	Oh, no, wait, that's the other thing, sorry.
614060	616540	Nationalism means that you love your people,
616540	622220	and if you hate half of your people, then yeah, that's kind of not congruent with each other.
622220	626540	So if you're serious about being a nationalist, you cannot harbor anti-female sentiments.
626540	629420	What you can, however, do is, just like I,
629420	634620	have, you know, a major issue with degeneracy emanating from Hollywood
634620	637980	and the mainstream culture, and feminism.
637980	640380	Those are the sort of things we must combat.
640380	644220	Remember, kids, it's only okay to get angry at vague concepts like
644220	647980	degeneracy, feminism, and bad things.
647980	650460	I hate bad things the most, those are the worst.
650460	652700	Only nationalism can stop bad things.
653420	654540	Oh, fuck, this is hard.
655260	656540	Oh, Jesus Christ.
656540	659180	You're not gonna go for the guy who sits there like,
659180	663420	oh, all of these other people are so mean, and women, they are so stupid.
663420	668700	They will not vote for that guy, and you're actively pushing women away from the larger movement.
668700	671740	You're doing a disservice with all these anti-female sentiments.
672780	675740	Listen, mate, I don't want to harsh your buzzer or anything,
675740	680700	but I'm pretty sure the fact you have to remind your fellow nationalists that misogyny is bad
680700	682620	is pretty telling, don't you think?
682620	683660	You might want to consider that.
685500	687660	Drop the anti-female sentiments.
687660	691420	He's trying to advise his fellow white nationalists that it's not right to be pissed off at the
691420	693900	majority of women who voted against nationalism.
693900	696620	You're supposed to love your country and its people, after all.
696620	699500	This is really the core contradiction of nationalist populism,
699500	702620	and why complaints about cultural Marxism, or international Jews,
702620	705820	or leftist feminist corruption are so important to them.
705820	708940	Nationalists love to pretend they love their countries.
708940	711340	It's supposedly a core tenet of their beliefs.
711340	713820	But when you pay close attention to what they're saying,
713900	716540	you realize they hate almost everything about their country,
716540	719500	and even imagine made-up things to hate about it, too.
719500	722700	And isn't one of the central tenets of the West freedom?
722700	726300	You know, of choice, and of speech, to do and say what you want?
726300	729180	The existence of people who make radically different choices from you
729180	732060	is proof that society is free, not that it's broken.
732620	735580	The Golden One at least pretends to like freedom and democracy,
735580	738380	but believes there should only be one vote per household.
738380	742380	So he even thinks that individuals' right to vote should be taken away.
742380	745740	But how can a nationalist who supposedly loves Western civilization
745740	748780	reconcile this with their hatred for almost all of its freedoms
748780	750780	and the choices other people have made with them?
751340	751900	Simple.
751900	753980	They invent and fetishize an imaginary,
753980	756540	prelapsarian version of their country that never existed,
756540	758380	where everyone was strong and beautiful,
758380	760060	and acted how they wanted them to,
760060	762540	straight out of the good times before the fall in the Bible,
762540	764380	or any given fantasy novel.
764380	766620	They love this made-up version of their country,
766620	768860	not the actual country they live in.
768860	771420	But despite saying you're supposed to love your people,
771420	774940	he openly believes that people don't listen to reasonable arguments.
774940	777100	– Everyone knows that I love fantasy.
777100	781020	I love Warhammer, and I love Lord of the Rings, Skyrim, The Witcher.
781900	786220	It's a pure fantasy that you think that you can just come in with these
787660	790700	reasonable arguments and change people's opinions.
790700	792460	Humans are not like that at all.
792460	793820	You can have, yeah, in the fantasy world,
793820	796380	a couple of elves sitting around having a reasonable discussion.
797020	798060	Humans aren't like that.
798060	799020	Women aren't like that.
799020	800060	Men aren't like that.
800060	802140	That doesn't sound like loving your people at all.
802140	805340	That sounds like you don't even trust them to think for themselves.
805340	808220	He's accidentally summed up nationalist populism better than me
808220	812140	by saying that he wishes life was a lot more like one of his fantasy books.
812140	815580	And that's not to say that liking fiction inherently makes you dumb, by the way.
815580	818380	I'm bench-pressing a giant bag of Marvel comics right now.
825100	827740	It's not that liking fiction is inherently bad for you.
827740	828460	Quite the opposite.
828460	831180	It's important to be something of a dreamer, in my opinion.
831180	835660	It's just that if you allow works of fiction to fully comprise your
835660	838460	worldview of how the world should actually be,
838460	840540	that can have some dangerous external effects,
840540	845340	like supporting nationalism or dangerous neoliberalism
845340	847020	or liking the Marvel movies.
847020	849260	All three of those things are equally as bad.
850060	851580	Speaking of facts and evidence,
851580	853420	it kind of goes without saying that he's really,
853420	855660	really not very good at the whole evidence thing.
855740	856860	In a video entitled
856860	860540	Why Sex Was Better 100 Years Ago, Feminism and Porn Are Enemies,
860540	862220	he cites one article.
862220	865340	And there's been a study which proves that
865340	869100	people with right-wing views have better sex.
869100	870780	He doesn't show what website it's from, though,
870780	872780	seemingly cutting off the title on purpose,
872780	875100	as if he knows it'll give away it's false.
875100	877500	Also, even the Telegraph article points out that
877500	881020	the data shows that, in some places, it doesn't...
882060	884220	Look, basically, though, it's fucking bullshit, all right?
884220	886780	He doesn't link the survey or demonstrate an understanding
886780	888060	of the survey's methodology—
888060	889420	who does that remind you of?—
889420	891180	and concludes, based purely on this
891180	893660	and some of his cartoon elf-dwarf-dragon-man books,
893660	896300	that sex was better before feminism and porn.
896300	898220	And what we have to realize with sex, also,
898220	902620	is that it's not primarily a physically-pleasing activity.
903260	904380	Yeah, if you're bad at it!
904380	905980	Jesus fucking Christ!
906620	909420	First and foremost, we can discuss what sex is.
909420	912060	Sex is a transaction of power.
912060	914060	Oh, talk dirty to me, golden one!
914060	915020	Oh, yeah!
915020	916220	Oh, it's getting good now!
918220	921020	Any wombs out there want to have a transaction of power?
922300	923820	Oh, Jesus, my fucking arms!
923820	929180	Now, however, he more or less needs the written permit
929180	931420	to initiate any sort of sexual contact
931420	932700	with his wife or girlfriend.
934220	936700	Obviously, I'm exaggerating, but you know what I mean.
937340	939020	You know, it kind of denigrates your position
939020	941500	when you admit that your example is exaggerated.
942140	944780	Like, oh, the states invaded our bedrooms
944780	947580	because we decided it was good to ask for consent.
947580	949100	It's Orwell's nightmare!
949100	951980	So, look, maybe this guy's ideas about sex and relationships
951980	954380	aren't very well-researched or based in reality,
954380	956780	but that hasn't stopped him from making, like, a dozen videos
956780	959260	on how to date women and talk to them
959260	961260	and act like a real manly man-man.
961820	964860	If I ever need any dating advice, and what are the odds of that,
964860	967100	I'll look you up, but right now I'm paggot.
967740	969500	All this exercise has made me thirsty.
970380	970880	Oh.
974780	978060	Maybe he should stop reading quite so many fiction books,
978060	980380	and I don't just mean the ones with dragons in them,
980380	983580	and read some, like, actual books as well.
983580	986300	Eventually, he might get to Lucian David Meck's books
986300	987420	about wolf behavior.
989740	990300	That's right.
990300	992140	We're at the part of the video where I actually went away
992140	993820	and did some fucking research.
993820	996700	Now you're in my wheelhouse, motherfucker!
997180	1001020	The Wolf, the Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species,
1001020	1003340	was the book which popularized the idea of
1003340	1005740	alpha-beta-pack mentality among wolves,
1005740	1009580	which MRAs like to pretend also happens in humans without any data.
1009580	1011340	But there's one problem.
1011340	1013180	A lot of the data Meck was drawing from
1013180	1015980	was based on wolf behavior in captivity.
1015980	1019580	You know, when you throw a bunch of captured wolves together
1019580	1021900	in a controlled space to see how they act.
1021900	1026860	It's appropriate to use the term alpha in an artificial pack
1026860	1030060	where, you know, you might put many wolves
1030060	1031900	from different assemblages together,
1031900	1033900	unrelated wolves and that kind of thing.
1033900	1036700	But that rarely happens in the wild, if ever.
1037340	1038780	Further research over the years,
1038780	1041820	including further books written by Meck afterwards,
1041820	1044780	show that in reality, the male and female leaders of a pack
1044780	1048140	are the leaders because they're the parents of the rest of the pack,
1048140	1050220	not because they're alphas who fought the hardest
1050220	1052300	and drank the most protein shakes.
1052300	1055980	So, not even wolves act like MRAs think people act.
1055980	1058060	There is, however, the hilarious side effect
1058060	1060620	that self-proclaimed alphas are effectively bragging
1060620	1063900	at how self-important they would act if you locked them in a cage.
1063900	1066380	Which is good to know, since, as you're well aware,
1066380	1068060	that's the goal of feminism.
1068060	1069740	And like all reasonable adults,
1069740	1072060	he likes to role-play the murder of people
1072060	1074300	who disagree with him in a video game.
1074860	1077260	Ah! Um...
1077260	1078940	How... how nice.
1078940	1081900	Open up this episode by killing this, uh...
1081900	1085020	this apprentice of the Frankfurt school.
1085020	1087260	No, I'm not kidding. He has this Let's Play of Skyrim
1087260	1088940	where he runs around killing dudes and says,
1088940	1090860	well, I guess they were a feminist.
1090860	1093260	Here's another one of those feminists
1093260	1095020	who don't believe in the patriarchy.
1095020	1097580	I've always felt pretty secure in my masculinity.
1097580	1098940	Please don't laugh.
1098940	1101260	But apparently, if I get any more secure,
1101260	1102940	if I get any more secure,
1102940	1107020	I'll start killing imaginary leftists in a video game.
1108700	1111020	This, uh, Hillary Clinton supporter
1111020	1113340	makes Skyrim great again.
1113340	1115180	It's important not to recognize this guy
1115180	1117180	as a dangerous threat to society.
1117180	1118140	He's really not.
1118140	1120140	He's a sad idiot seeking refuge
1120140	1122540	in obnoxious preening self-aggrandizement
1122540	1125500	for attention and to fabricate a sense of self-worth.
1125500	1127980	Sure, his ideas are ostensibly dangerous,
1127980	1130380	but he channels these ideas into the harmless place
1130380	1132380	of making dumb videos for the internet,
1132380	1134140	shilling cartoon fantasy novels,
1134140	1136700	and screaming about how great killing feminists is
1136700	1137580	over Skyrim.
1139420	1141020	This guy is a male feminist.
1142380	1143820	I honestly can't believe it.
1143820	1146540	Like, I don't like—
1146540	1148620	I don't like the idea that I'm strawmanning people,
1148620	1149740	and here he is going,
1149740	1151100	no, I'm made of straw.
1151100	1152540	I'm killing fake feminists.
1152540	1153500	And then I'm just gonna—
1153500	1155180	Ha ha ha ha ha!
1155180	1157020	It's very easy to convince yourself
1157020	1158460	this man is somehow dangerous,
1158460	1160620	but that's probably what he wants you to think.
1160620	1162780	That would make him worth paying attention to,
1162780	1164380	and you really shouldn't bother.
1164380	1166940	Sound and thunder don't often signify very much.
1166940	1169020	It's not a crime to be a psychotic weirdo
1169020	1170220	over video game footage,
1170220	1171500	and thank God for that.
1171500	1174060	If this is the best his philosophy has to offer,
1174060	1176300	then leftists like us have already won.
1176300	1178300	We've so fully cucked the alphas
1178300	1179580	that they sit at their computers
1179580	1181260	filming themselves playing video games
1181260	1183340	and ranting about how great their ideas would be
1183340	1185420	if they got around to doing anything.
1185420	1187660	I joked earlier about how alpha mentality
1187660	1189100	only formed in cages,
1189100	1191420	but look, it really has.
1191420	1192700	They caged themselves.
1193340	1194620	And, uh, by the way,
1194620	1197180	if you're annoyed that companies stop sponsoring you
1197180	1199580	because they don't like the implications
1199580	1200700	that your beliefs will have
1200700	1202700	on their product and its values,
1202700	1206380	you're not actually angry at leftists or degeneracy.
1206380	1207740	You're angry at the free market.
1208540	1211100	And now you're talking MY language!
1211100	1213740	Let's take society back for the people, comrade!
1213740	1215500	The only way we know how!
1215500	1217900	Us alphas! That's a thing that's real!
1234460	1236860	Well, it's been a very fun first year, friendos.
1236860	1239180	On top of the names scrolling past the screen right now,
1239180	1241180	I'd especially like to thank

1347740	1351980	I'd also like to thank Max Woodhams for producing the music track I used for my opening theme
1351980	1356300	and then graciously giving me the mp3 after I heard it and insisted he let me use it.
1356300	1359660	I think he originally was going to use it for a piece of music that he never finished,
1359660	1363020	uh, so I'm really glad he let me just steal it and put it in my videos.
1363820	1370460	Pizza Gate is the stuff of nightmares.
1372460	1374540	Fuck off.
