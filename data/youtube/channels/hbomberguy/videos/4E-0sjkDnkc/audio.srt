If you haven't played UNDERTALE yet,

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,840
HOW?!

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,200
W-WHY?!

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,620
You can keep watching if you want,

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,800
but I'm gonna spoil everything in UNDERTALE just to spite you.

7

Why haven't you given Toby Fox your MONEY?!

["Undertale Theme"]

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
I really like UNDERTALE.

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,440
UNDERTALE and Lisa are the best RPGs I think I've ever played,

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,580
and the fact that they came out within a year of each other completely astounds me.

13
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,840
Hold on, did they actually do that one?

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,800
Yeah, they did. Okay.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
I could talk for hours about all the things I like about it

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,360
and think are cool and funny,

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,800
the neat little touches, like how the puzzles in Hotland

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,840
are very obviously training simulators for killing a human,

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,400
complete with the same heart-breaking-apart sound effect,

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,160
or the way they run so much with Asgore's terrible ability to come up with names for things

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,840
that Asriel, which should be an incredibly cool and prophetic name,

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,080
is also very clearly Asgore combining his and his wife's names,

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,480
or the way the True Lab is a metaphor for Toby Fox's own past experiments

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,360
featuring aspects of the edgy Earthbound hack he made as a teenager

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,720
and doesn't really like being associated with anymore,

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,320
or the way that sign says three out of four blocks recommend you push them

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,320
because one of the four you encounter in the game doesn't like it,

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,880
or the increasingly elaborate mouse cheese bits,

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,720
or the way the heart you use to select menu options sprouts legs and runs away when you pick run away,

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,760
or the pacing and timing of just a regular old bucket...

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,480
...of snails,

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,320
or the way the king really does trim a hedge in the shape of Papyrus's face at the end,

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,120
or...

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,360
CRIME!

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Ugh.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,320
Undertale is a never-ending trip to Funtown, but I'm not really here to talk about that.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,600
After all, if you've already played it, you've noticed a bunch of these for yourself, if not more,

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,280
and doubtlessly watched other people tell you about them, too.

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,600
In fact, a lot of videos about Undertale have kind of already covered the same ground over and over

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,000
in agonizing re-explanations of the plot

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,120
or engaging in bizarre theorizing about minor plot content.

Why is Sans called Sans?

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,000
Could it be because he's Sans his skin?

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Because he's a skeleton?

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,480
And why is Undyne all fish-themed, but she uses energy spears?

49
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,760
That's not what fish do!

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Clearly, Undyne is actually descended from some other energy spear-throwing fish-themed character from some other game!

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,880
By the way, have I talked about Five Nights at Freddy's yet?!

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,240

I want to talk about stuff that seems to not really be discussed as much.

55

["SANS THEME"]

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,920
I'm sorry, look.

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,960
Let's start at the beginning.

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,960
What is Undertale about?

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,760
Games can be about different things to different people.

62
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,560
But for me, at least, it's about fandom.

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,280
It's about cultures that form around various kinds of media,

64
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,640
and a frank examination of the effects of those cultures.

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,400
This is most personified in the character whose beliefs, ideas, and choices the game spends the most time exploring.

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
Dr. Alphys.

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,360
Initially, she seems super obsessed with anime, almost as a joke in itself.

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,240
Like, haha, isn't it silly that this person enjoys dumb cartoons and has opinions about them?

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,000
But the story digs a little deeper.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,240
It becomes clear that Alphys is a tremendously anxious person for justifiable reasons,

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,400
who worries that they aren't a good person and aren't capable of helping others.

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,120
She worries a lot about even calling you to give you advice.

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,040
But when she starts actually talking about a show she likes, she can't contain herself.

74
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,360
She goes on tirades about the sequel, interrupts the quiz battle to talk about an episode,

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,320
and gets so wrapped up in explaining the story to you as she recommends it

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,640
that she starts interrupting her own dialogue boxes.

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,760
Anime is, instead of this silly thing for idiots, an opportunity to connect with someone else.

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,640
She recounts that the character doesn't fit in because she has cat ears,

79
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,360
which isn't normal in our world, but eventually discovers her friends accept her for who she is,

80
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,000
mirroring her own desire to be accepted, something she's initially afraid could never happen.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It takes the course of the entire game for her to realize that people care about her.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,160
The game fully recognizes that enjoying something,

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,680
even something objectively dumb like anime, which it is, it's really dumb,

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,680
is dumb for understandable reasons, because it communicates something meaningful to us.

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,280
It's proof we're capable of empathy, that we see ourselves in something.

86
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,040
Even if that something is a video game or a cartoon about a girl with cat ears.

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,480
The character that became Metaton met Alphys through a human fan club.

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,360
They forged a friendship out of a mutual enjoyment of something,

89
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,200
even though Metaton clearly thinks very little of Alphys' taste in media.

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,720
She's a dork, and she's obsessed with these awful cartoons, but she's funny.

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
I want to see her again.

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,560
When Undyne is confessing her feelings for Alphys,

93
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,240
it doesn't turn out she likes her because she secretly also likes anime or anything like that.

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,200
In fact, she seems to hate it, but she simply loves how much she cares about the things she likes.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,800
So through this character, we learn a pretty important and straightforward message.

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,320
Fandom can be a good thing.

97
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,000
The game is careful to point out that these people are good not in spite of,

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,120
but because they're capable of caring about something that might seem silly and pointless to someone else.

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,320
What's more human than being capable of falling in love with something?

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,280
It would have been so easy to make dumb jokes about people who like anime

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,200
too much being silly or weird and needing to tone it down to be accepted and fit in,

102
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,600
but it turns it into a heartwarming story about how it's this passion for things that makes us what we are.

103
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,920
Alphys learns to be okay with liking what she likes

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,680
and get over the need to judge herself for it based on what other people might think.

105
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,480
It's easy to be dismissive of people who like something we don't.

106
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,960
It's hard to appreciate a person's capacity for love if it isn't over something we love.

107
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,600
And yeah, I made fun of game theory earlier, but you know what?

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,160
If you like thinking about game lore and looking for possible,

109
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,760
though tenuous, connections between Undertale and EarthBound, good.

110
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,640
I'm glad you sincerely care about something enough to do that.

111
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,240
I think it's dumb to do that and you're stupid,

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,600
but I love you because the ability to care is inherently good.

113
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,480
I really, really like the Star Wars prequels,

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,800
and now you have no choice but to love me for it.

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,760
Gotcha!

116
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,280
To put it in layman's terms, and let's be honest, I am a rather lame man,

117
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,200
Undertale is a game about how it's good to really like spaghetti.

118
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm more of a tagliatelle person, but you do you, cartoon skeleton.

119
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,480
So, so far, Undertale's a game about how cool fan culture can be.

120
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,240
But it doesn't just say, hey, like what you want, it's good to like things, and then go home.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,560
The game's got an idealistic and oddly rare message,

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,920
but the game manages to be very careful about how it presents this point.

123
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,960
Toby Fox himself has a history of making fun of dumb aspects of fandoms,

124
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,040
even going so far as to compose the parody homestuck rock opera The Baby Is You

125
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,680
about a character somehow giving birth to their best friend

126
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,680
to satire the bizarre limits of weird homestuck fanfiction.

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,960
It's possible to go about liking something in a way that's detrimental.

128
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,360
In the early game, Toriel won't let you try to leave the ruins

129
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,000
and will actively avoid answering questions about leaving,

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,920
but if you press her on it, she decides to destroy the exit, ensuring you can never leave.

131
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,480
It's clear she cares a lot about you and protecting you from harm,

132
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,720
but this isn't a completely good thing, is it?

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,600
She's so dedicated to protecting you from possible danger

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,440
that she's prepared to make sure you never even run the risk of encountering it again.

135
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,760
The outside world is scary and full of risks,

136
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,080
so she decides you're better off never going out into it.

137
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,520
Toriel isn't a bad person.

138
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,400
She's just someone who cares about protecting someone precious to her

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,320
in a way that might be bad for them both.

140
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
Let's talk about Asriel.

141
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,000
As the final boss and arguable antagonist,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,080
it stands to reason that the game is ultimately about

143
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,560
finding ways to challenge his perspective on the world.

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,800
So, what is his perspective?

145
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,600
At one point, he openly addresses the main character-slash-player,

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,760
saying that this whole story is a game,

147
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,800
and winning it, essentially, is putting an end to the game.

148
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,600
He fears the player being done with them and moving on.

149
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,760
His objective is to keep you playing forever,

150
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,920
so he dangles a happy ending in front of you,

151
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,040
even going so far as to give you advice on how to get better endings,

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
just to keep you going.

153
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,720
Once he becomes all-powerful, he doesn't destroy the world.

154
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
He fights you over and over.

155
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
It becomes clear over the course of the final battle

156
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,600
that all he really wants is to be with his lost sibling forever,

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,800
and that means doing everything he can to ensure this fight never ends.

158
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,040
You literally can't die at this point.

159
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
It's the Toriel encounter all over again.

160
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,920
The true run of the game largely involves helping Alphys and Asriel

161
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,600
get over something terrible that happened

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,440
and learn to interact with the world again

163
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,640
while being completely accepting of the things they care about.

164
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,280
There's a third Toriel-esque character in the game,

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,640
trying to keep someone contained

166
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
just so they don't have to risk things changing.

167
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,320
Think about when the barrier is destroyed.

168
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,760
Finally, everyone is on the title screen.

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,120
It's playing the happiest tune,

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,240
and you can talk to everyone in the world and give them a final goodbye.

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Everyone has new dialogue about their impending freedom,

172
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
and then you leave.

173
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You get a really cool sequence of all the characters

174
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,760
enjoying their freedom in the outside world.

175
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,200
You see what everyone's up to,

176
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,240
you get attacked by the Special Thanks in the hardest challenge in the game,

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
and then it finally ends.

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,320
It's over.

179
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,680
The ending is so final that you can't leave this screen.

180
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,000
You have to close the game to move on.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,520
But what happens if you reopen it?

182
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,920
Asriel turns up.

183
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,280
He points out that everyone's gone and got their happy ending,

184
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,360
but you still have the power to ruin it.

185
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,600
If you load your save, everyone's back in the underground,

186
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,320
not even aware they had their freedom ripped away from them.

187
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,080
The game remembers, though.

188
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,120
The title screen is empty, and the music is gone.

189
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,320
The game is judging you for returning to a world you should have been done with.

190
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,520
The player becomes the final analogue to Asriel,

191
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,960
someone who likes the world so much that they want to go back to it again.

192
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,840
In my Braid video, which statistically none of you watched,

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,240
I talked about the idea of anti-completionism,

194
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,960
for wanting to see everything in a game just because you can,

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,560
for the sake of having done it.

196
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,720
Undertale does this by placing a moral weight on the decision to replay the game.

197
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,920
You're literally reversing time and retrapping everyone.

198
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,720
You're put in the position of the game's own tragic villain,

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,160
someone who enjoys something so much that they'd make things worse for others,

200
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,520
trap them in the underground again just so you can relive the experience of

201
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,760
meeting them, befriending them, and setting them free.

202
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,000
Interestingly enough, at the very end of the game,

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,760
if you choose to stay with Toriel at the end,

204
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,920
she all but chastises you, pointing out that

205
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,720
if you were really so content with just being with her,

206
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
you would never have left,

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,840
and this good thing would never have happened.

208
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,240
You'd have just been closed off eating butterscotch pie

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,920
and reading the same books forever.

210
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,320
Then she literally handholds you out of the game.

211
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,080
By doing this, Undertale is subtly criticizing you for being a fan of Undertale.

212
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,400
It's good to like games, but isn't there something a little bad

213
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,640
about wanting to stay in it forever?

214
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
If you keep getting neutral endings,

215
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,480
Flowey eventually just asks,

216
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,760
don't you have anything better to do?

217
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,120
Something better to do than completing a game over and over

218
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,720
just to see what would happen?

219
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,640
And in his other form, in the best ending,

220
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,920
before you leave the underground,

221
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,880
if you walk all the way to the first screen of the game,

222
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,160
Asriel's right there.

223
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,160
And if you keep talking to him over and over,

224
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,760
eventually, he just keeps asking the same question.

225
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,080
The Genocide Run is essentially one long commentary

226
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,440
on how the player is only doing this

227
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
because they want to see what happens.

228
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,080
They want more Undertale content.

229
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,040
And this is what makes them the ultimate monster,

230
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,320
not some simplistic bloodlust or hatred for all life.

231
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,840
This is also Asriel's reasoning for being so antagonistic as Flowey.

232
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,520
He's done everything so many times

233
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,400
that his sheer boredom has led him to want to see the end of everything

234
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,640
just because it's the last thing left to do.

235
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,560
If you do the Genocide Run a second time,

236
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,960
the character, who incidentally are named Brexit,

237
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,760
openly recommends that you really ought to do something else.

238
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,120
You are wracked with a perverted sentimentality.

239
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,520
I think moments like these are the ultimate point of the game's message.

240
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,720
That fandom is fine.

241
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,320
After all, it's ultimately an excuse for real contact with other people.

242
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,920
But it's important not to lose sight of the reasons why you enjoy something.

243
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,840
Undertale's harshest criticism isn't that people are stupid for making this mistake.

244
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,080
In fact, it's important to appreciate the good in people,

245
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
even if you think they are stupid.

246
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,360
It merely points out that it's possible to love something unwisely.

247
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,960
It's for that reason that I probably won't play Undertale again after making this video.

248
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,320
In his review of Undertale,

249
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,960
Austin Walker wrote that Undertale has a resonant message

250
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,040
that we can love games without feeling the need

251
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,360
to wring every last ounce of content out of them.

252
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,640
Luckily for me, at least one other game critic noticed the message,

253
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,240
and they happened to be the best one,

254
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,480
who's always right.

255
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,200
Getting too attached to a game about dealing with the problems

256
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,040
that come with certain kinds of attachment

257
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,320
seems like it would be missing the point.

258
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,120
If you tell Toriel you have places to go,

259
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,680
she just says,

260
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,040
see you around.

261
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,600
The ending seems slightly anticlimactic,

262
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,440
but isn't that what life is like?

263
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,200
There are memes out there about people talking about how cool it is to be raised by anime,

264
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,960
and all the cool lessons they learned.

265
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,120
It's really easy to make fun of this notion,

266
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,840
but can you imagine a world where people really did act like the heroes of the stories they liked,

267
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,440
applied all the lessons they'd learned?

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,320
I think that would be a magical world to live in.

269
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,960
So you're right.

270
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,280
I do have better things to do.

271
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,200
See you around, Undertale.

272
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:45,160
Thanks for watching.

273
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,520
Uh, this video hasn't been very funny,

274
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,760
because I'm nowhere near as funny as Undertale,

275
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,000
and I thought it would be wrong to even bother to try.

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,440
I started writing, and a bunch of real feelings fell out onto my keyboard.

277
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,520
I'd like to say a very special thanks to

278
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Renslayer,

279
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
Rikami,

280
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
Robert Phillips.

281
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,480
I moved the credits around so that, uh, I could thank Samuel in this video.

282
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,600
Scarthorax.

283
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,760
LORD OF THE ROUCHES!

284
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,280
Scott Gwertin?

285
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
Oh, God.

286
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
Oh, I'm gonna look up how his name's pronounced right now.

287
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm sure he's mentioned it somewhere.

288
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,760
Okay, I don't know. I can't find it.

289
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,640
So, uh, Scott Gwertin, or Gertin, or Gertin?

290
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,600
I think that's all of them.

291
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,680
If it's another one, I'm—I'm so sorry.

292
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,960
Sean Higgins,

293
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,480
Siegfried Pinzer,

294
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
Sticky Hunter,

295
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,280
Thad Wazalewski,

296
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,200
Two Armed Blue and Red Drapes,

297
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,560
the S is—is gone now,

298
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
Zachariah Taylor,

299
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
iDragonarian,

300
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
and I am Turnip.

301
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh, I know that look.

302
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,280
That's the look of someone who just realized

303
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,040
that I cooked an entire plate of spaghetti

304
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,640
just for a one-off joke in a video

305
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
mostly centered around analyzing the tastes

306
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,360
of a fictional lesbian dinosaur scientist.

307
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,000
But it turns out that kind of thing's all right.

308
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Undertale told me so.
