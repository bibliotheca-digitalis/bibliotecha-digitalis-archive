00:00.000 --> 00:02.180
This video contains spoilers for UNDERTALE.

00:02.180 --> 00:03.840
If you haven't played UNDERTALE yet,

00:03.840 --> 00:04.840
HOW?!

00:05.140 --> 00:06.200
W-WHY?!

00:06.200 --> 00:07.620
You can keep watching if you want,

00:07.620 --> 00:10.800
but I'm gonna spoil everything in UNDERTALE just to spite you.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.400
Why haven't you given Toby Fox your MONEY?!

00:14.400 --> 00:17.020
["Undertale Theme"]

00:17.020 --> 00:17.920
["Undertale Theme"]

00:17.920 --> 00:19.280
I really like UNDERTALE.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.440
UNDERTALE and Lisa are the best RPGs I think I've ever played,

00:22.440 --> 00:25.580
and the fact that they came out within a year of each other completely astounds me.

00:25.580 --> 00:26.840
Hold on, did they actually do that one?

00:27.720 --> 00:28.800
Yeah, they did. Okay.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.120
I could talk for hours about all the things I like about it

00:31.120 --> 00:32.360
and think are cool and funny,

00:32.360 --> 00:34.800
the neat little touches, like how the puzzles in Hotland

00:34.800 --> 00:37.840
are very obviously training simulators for killing a human,

00:37.840 --> 00:40.400
complete with the same heart-breaking-apart sound effect,

00:45.360 --> 00:49.160
or the way they run so much with Asgore's terrible ability to come up with names for things

00:49.160 --> 00:51.840
that Asriel, which should be an incredibly cool and prophetic name,

00:51.840 --> 00:55.080
is also very clearly Asgore combining his and his wife's names,

00:55.080 --> 00:58.480
or the way the True Lab is a metaphor for Toby Fox's own past experiments

00:58.480 --> 01:01.360
featuring aspects of the edgy Earthbound hack he made as a teenager

01:01.360 --> 01:03.720
and doesn't really like being associated with anymore,

01:03.720 --> 01:06.320
or the way that sign says three out of four blocks recommend you push them

01:06.320 --> 01:09.320
because one of the four you encounter in the game doesn't like it,

01:09.320 --> 01:11.880
or the increasingly elaborate mouse cheese bits,

01:11.880 --> 01:16.720
or the way the heart you use to select menu options sprouts legs and runs away when you pick run away,

01:16.720 --> 01:19.760
or the pacing and timing of just a regular old bucket...

01:20.520 --> 01:21.480
...of snails,

01:21.520 --> 01:25.320
or the way the king really does trim a hedge in the shape of Papyrus's face at the end,

01:25.320 --> 01:26.120
or...

01:26.120 --> 01:27.360
CRIME!

01:27.360 --> 01:28.360
Ugh.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.320
Undertale is a never-ending trip to Funtown, but I'm not really here to talk about that.

01:33.320 --> 01:37.600
After all, if you've already played it, you've noticed a bunch of these for yourself, if not more,

01:37.600 --> 01:40.280
and doubtlessly watched other people tell you about them, too.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.600
In fact, a lot of videos about Undertale have kind of already covered the same ground over and over

01:44.600 --> 01:47.000
in agonizing re-explanations of the plot

01:47.000 --> 01:50.120
or engaging in bizarre theorizing about minor plot content.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.880
["SANS THEME"]

01:55.880 --> 01:57.640
Why is Sans called Sans?

01:57.640 --> 02:01.000
Could it be because he's Sans his skin?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.520
Because he's a skeleton?

02:02.520 --> 02:05.160
Go to Lootcrate.com and enter the offer code LIFEISPAIN

02:05.160 --> 02:08.840
to get a discount on meaningless trash that won't fill the hole inherent to the self!

02:08.840 --> 02:11.480
And why is Undyne all fish-themed, but she uses energy spears?

02:11.480 --> 02:12.760
That's not what fish do!

02:12.760 --> 02:16.760
Clearly, Undyne is actually descended from some other energy spear-throwing fish-themed character from some other game!

02:16.760 --> 02:19.880
By the way, have I talked about Five Nights at Freddy's yet?!

02:20.440 --> 02:23.240
But hey, that's just a theory.

02:23.240 --> 02:32.120
["FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S THEME"]

02:32.120 --> 02:35.320
I want to talk about stuff that seems to not really be discussed as much.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.400
The ideas the game puts forward.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.680
Its philosophical impli-

02:38.680 --> 02:39.960
["SANS THEME"]

02:39.960 --> 02:40.920
I'm sorry, look.

02:40.920 --> 02:41.960
Let's start at the beginning.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.960
What is Undertale about?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.760
Games can be about different things to different people.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.560
But for me, at least, it's about fandom.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.280
It's about cultures that form around various kinds of media,

02:52.280 --> 02:55.640
and a frank examination of the effects of those cultures.

02:55.640 --> 03:01.400
This is most personified in the character whose beliefs, ideas, and choices the game spends the most time exploring.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.520
Dr. Alphys.

03:02.520 --> 03:06.360
Initially, she seems super obsessed with anime, almost as a joke in itself.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.240
Like, haha, isn't it silly that this person enjoys dumb cartoons and has opinions about them?

03:11.240 --> 03:13.000
But the story digs a little deeper.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.240
It becomes clear that Alphys is a tremendously anxious person for justifiable reasons,

03:17.240 --> 03:21.400
who worries that they aren't a good person and aren't capable of helping others.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.120
She worries a lot about even calling you to give you advice.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.040
But when she starts actually talking about a show she likes, she can't contain herself.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.360
She goes on tirades about the sequel, interrupts the quiz battle to talk about an episode,

03:32.360 --> 03:35.320
and gets so wrapped up in explaining the story to you as she recommends it

03:35.320 --> 03:37.640
that she starts interrupting her own dialogue boxes.

03:37.640 --> 03:42.760
Anime is, instead of this silly thing for idiots, an opportunity to connect with someone else.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.640
She recounts that the character doesn't fit in because she has cat ears,

03:45.640 --> 03:50.360
which isn't normal in our world, but eventually discovers her friends accept her for who she is,

03:50.360 --> 03:55.000
mirroring her own desire to be accepted, something she's initially afraid could never happen.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
It takes the course of the entire game for her to realize that people care about her.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.160
The game fully recognizes that enjoying something,

04:01.160 --> 04:04.680
even something objectively dumb like anime, which it is, it's really dumb,

04:04.680 --> 04:08.680
is dumb for understandable reasons, because it communicates something meaningful to us.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.280
It's proof we're capable of empathy, that we see ourselves in something.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.040
Even if that something is a video game or a cartoon about a girl with cat ears.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.480
The character that became Metaton met Alphys through a human fan club.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.360
They forged a friendship out of a mutual enjoyment of something,

04:22.360 --> 04:26.200
even though Metaton clearly thinks very little of Alphys' taste in media.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.720
She's a dork, and she's obsessed with these awful cartoons, but she's funny.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.160
I want to see her again.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.560
When Undyne is confessing her feelings for Alphys,

04:33.560 --> 04:37.240
it doesn't turn out she likes her because she secretly also likes anime or anything like that.

04:37.240 --> 04:42.200
In fact, she seems to hate it, but she simply loves how much she cares about the things she likes.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.800
So through this character, we learn a pretty important and straightforward message.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.320
Fandom can be a good thing.

04:47.320 --> 04:51.000
The game is careful to point out that these people are good not in spite of,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.120
but because they're capable of caring about something that might seem silly and pointless to someone else.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.320
What's more human than being capable of falling in love with something?

04:59.320 --> 05:02.280
It would have been so easy to make dumb jokes about people who like anime

05:02.280 --> 05:06.200
too much being silly or weird and needing to tone it down to be accepted and fit in,

05:06.200 --> 05:10.600
but it turns it into a heartwarming story about how it's this passion for things that makes us what we are.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.920
Alphys learns to be okay with liking what she likes

05:12.920 --> 05:16.680
and get over the need to judge herself for it based on what other people might think.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.480
It's easy to be dismissive of people who like something we don't.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.960
It's hard to appreciate a person's capacity for love if it isn't over something we love.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.600
And yeah, I made fun of game theory earlier, but you know what?

05:26.600 --> 05:29.160
If you like thinking about game lore and looking for possible,

05:29.160 --> 05:32.760
though tenuous, connections between Undertale and EarthBound, good.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.640
I'm glad you sincerely care about something enough to do that.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.240
I think it's dumb to do that and you're stupid,

05:37.240 --> 05:40.600
but I love you because the ability to care is inherently good.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.480
I really, really like the Star Wars prequels,

05:43.480 --> 05:45.800
and now you have no choice but to love me for it.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.760
Gotcha!

05:46.760 --> 05:50.280
To put it in layman's terms, and let's be honest, I am a rather lame man,

05:50.280 --> 05:54.200
Undertale is a game about how it's good to really like spaghetti.

05:59.640 --> 06:03.800
I'm more of a tagliatelle person, but you do you, cartoon skeleton.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.480
So, so far, Undertale's a game about how cool fan culture can be.

06:07.480 --> 06:11.240
But it doesn't just say, hey, like what you want, it's good to like things, and then go home.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.560
The game's got an idealistic and oddly rare message,

06:13.560 --> 06:16.920
but the game manages to be very careful about how it presents this point.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.960
Toby Fox himself has a history of making fun of dumb aspects of fandoms,

06:19.960 --> 06:24.040
even going so far as to compose the parody homestuck rock opera The Baby Is You

06:24.040 --> 06:26.680
about a character somehow giving birth to their best friend

06:26.680 --> 06:30.680
to satire the bizarre limits of weird homestuck fanfiction.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.960
It's possible to go about liking something in a way that's detrimental.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.360
In the early game, Toriel won't let you try to leave the ruins

06:36.360 --> 06:39.000
and will actively avoid answering questions about leaving,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.920
but if you press her on it, she decides to destroy the exit, ensuring you can never leave.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.480
It's clear she cares a lot about you and protecting you from harm,

06:45.480 --> 06:47.720
but this isn't a completely good thing, is it?

06:47.720 --> 06:50.600
She's so dedicated to protecting you from possible danger

06:50.600 --> 06:54.440
that she's prepared to make sure you never even run the risk of encountering it again.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.760
The outside world is scary and full of risks,

06:56.760 --> 06:59.080
so she decides you're better off never going out into it.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.520
Toriel isn't a bad person.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.400
She's just someone who cares about protecting someone precious to her

07:03.400 --> 07:05.320
in a way that might be bad for them both.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.520
Let's talk about Asriel.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.000
As the final boss and arguable antagonist,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.080
it stands to reason that the game is ultimately about

07:11.080 --> 07:13.560
finding ways to challenge his perspective on the world.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.800
So, what is his perspective?

07:15.800 --> 07:18.600
At one point, he openly addresses the main character-slash-player,

07:18.600 --> 07:20.760
saying that this whole story is a game,

07:20.760 --> 07:23.800
and winning it, essentially, is putting an end to the game.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.600
He fears the player being done with them and moving on.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.760
His objective is to keep you playing forever,

07:28.760 --> 07:30.920
so he dangles a happy ending in front of you,

07:30.920 --> 07:34.040
even going so far as to give you advice on how to get better endings,

07:34.040 --> 07:35.240
just to keep you going.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.720
Once he becomes all-powerful, he doesn't destroy the world.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.720
He fights you over and over.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.720
It becomes clear over the course of the final battle

07:41.720 --> 07:44.600
that all he really wants is to be with his lost sibling forever,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.800
and that means doing everything he can to ensure this fight never ends.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.040
You literally can't die at this point.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.040
It's the Toriel encounter all over again.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.920
The true run of the game largely involves helping Alphys and Asriel

07:54.920 --> 07:56.600
get over something terrible that happened

07:56.600 --> 07:58.440
and learn to interact with the world again

07:58.440 --> 08:01.640
while being completely accepting of the things they care about.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.280
There's a third Toriel-esque character in the game,

08:04.280 --> 08:05.640
trying to keep someone contained

08:05.640 --> 08:07.640
just so they don't have to risk things changing.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.320
Think about when the barrier is destroyed.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.760
Finally, everyone is on the title screen.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.120
It's playing the happiest tune,

08:16.120 --> 08:19.240
and you can talk to everyone in the world and give them a final goodbye.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.800
Everyone has new dialogue about their impending freedom,

08:21.800 --> 08:22.920
and then you leave.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.920
You get a really cool sequence of all the characters

08:24.920 --> 08:26.760
enjoying their freedom in the outside world.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.200
You see what everyone's up to,

08:28.200 --> 08:31.240
you get attacked by the Special Thanks in the hardest challenge in the game,

08:31.240 --> 08:32.680
and then it finally ends.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.320
It's over.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.680
The ending is so final that you can't leave this screen.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.000
You have to close the game to move on.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.520
But what happens if you reopen it?

08:41.960 --> 08:42.920
Asriel turns up.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.280
He points out that everyone's gone and got their happy ending,

08:46.280 --> 08:48.360
but you still have the power to ruin it.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.600
If you load your save, everyone's back in the underground,

08:50.600 --> 08:53.320
not even aware they had their freedom ripped away from them.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.080
The game remembers, though.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.120
The title screen is empty, and the music is gone.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.320
The game is judging you for returning to a world you should have been done with.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.520
The player becomes the final analogue to Asriel,

09:04.520 --> 09:07.960
someone who likes the world so much that they want to go back to it again.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.840
In my Braid video, which statistically none of you watched,

09:10.840 --> 09:13.240
I talked about the idea of anti-completionism,

09:13.240 --> 09:15.960
for wanting to see everything in a game just because you can,

09:15.960 --> 09:17.560
for the sake of having done it.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.720
Undertale does this by placing a moral weight on the decision to replay the game.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.920
You're literally reversing time and retrapping everyone.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.720
You're put in the position of the game's own tragic villain,

09:27.720 --> 09:31.160
someone who enjoys something so much that they'd make things worse for others,

09:31.160 --> 09:34.520
trap them in the underground again just so you can relive the experience of

09:34.520 --> 09:36.760
meeting them, befriending them, and setting them free.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.000
Interestingly enough, at the very end of the game,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.760
if you choose to stay with Toriel at the end,

09:40.760 --> 09:42.920
she all but chastises you, pointing out that

09:42.920 --> 09:45.720
if you were really so content with just being with her,

09:45.720 --> 09:47.000
you would never have left,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.840
and this good thing would never have happened.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.240
You'd have just been closed off eating butterscotch pie

09:51.240 --> 09:52.920
and reading the same books forever.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.320
Then she literally handholds you out of the game.

09:55.320 --> 09:59.080
By doing this, Undertale is subtly criticizing you for being a fan of Undertale.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.400
It's good to like games, but isn't there something a little bad

10:01.400 --> 10:03.640
about wanting to stay in it forever?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
If you keep getting neutral endings,

10:05.640 --> 10:07.480
Flowey eventually just asks,

10:07.480 --> 10:08.760
don't you have anything better to do?

10:09.640 --> 10:12.120
Something better to do than completing a game over and over

10:12.120 --> 10:13.720
just to see what would happen?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.640
And in his other form, in the best ending,

10:15.640 --> 10:16.920
before you leave the underground,

10:16.920 --> 10:19.880
if you walk all the way to the first screen of the game,

10:19.880 --> 10:21.160
Asriel's right there.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.160
And if you keep talking to him over and over,

10:23.800 --> 10:26.760
eventually, he just keeps asking the same question.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.080
The Genocide Run is essentially one long commentary

10:29.080 --> 10:30.440
on how the player is only doing this

10:30.440 --> 10:32.120
because they want to see what happens.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.080
They want more Undertale content.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.040
And this is what makes them the ultimate monster,

10:38.040 --> 10:41.320
not some simplistic bloodlust or hatred for all life.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.840
This is also Asriel's reasoning for being so antagonistic as Flowey.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.520
He's done everything so many times

10:46.520 --> 10:49.400
that his sheer boredom has led him to want to see the end of everything

10:49.400 --> 10:51.640
just because it's the last thing left to do.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.560
If you do the Genocide Run a second time,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.960
the character, who incidentally are named Brexit,

10:55.960 --> 10:58.760
openly recommends that you really ought to do something else.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.120
You are wracked with a perverted sentimentality.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.520
I think moments like these are the ultimate point of the game's message.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.720
That fandom is fine.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.320
After all, it's ultimately an excuse for real contact with other people.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.920
But it's important not to lose sight of the reasons why you enjoy something.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.840
Undertale's harshest criticism isn't that people are stupid for making this mistake.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.080
In fact, it's important to appreciate the good in people,

11:21.080 --> 11:22.600
even if you think they are stupid.

11:22.600 --> 11:26.360
It merely points out that it's possible to love something unwisely.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.960
It's for that reason that I probably won't play Undertale again after making this video.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.320
In his review of Undertale,

11:31.320 --> 11:33.960
Austin Walker wrote that Undertale has a resonant message

11:33.960 --> 11:36.040
that we can love games without feeling the need

11:36.040 --> 11:38.360
to wring every last ounce of content out of them.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.640
Luckily for me, at least one other game critic noticed the message,

11:41.640 --> 11:43.240
and they happened to be the best one,

11:43.240 --> 11:45.480
who's always right.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.200
Getting too attached to a game about dealing with the problems

11:48.200 --> 11:50.040
that come with certain kinds of attachment

11:50.040 --> 11:51.320
seems like it would be missing the point.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.120
If you tell Toriel you have places to go,

11:54.120 --> 11:54.680
she just says,

11:55.320 --> 11:56.040
see you around.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.600
The ending seems slightly anticlimactic,

11:58.600 --> 12:00.440
but isn't that what life is like?

12:00.440 --> 12:04.200
There are memes out there about people talking about how cool it is to be raised by anime,

12:04.200 --> 12:05.960
and all the cool lessons they learned.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.120
It's really easy to make fun of this notion,

12:08.120 --> 12:12.840
but can you imagine a world where people really did act like the heroes of the stories they liked,

12:12.840 --> 12:14.440
applied all the lessons they'd learned?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.320
I think that would be a magical world to live in.

12:17.320 --> 12:17.960
So you're right.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.280
I do have better things to do.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.200
See you around, Undertale.

12:22.200 --> 12:45.160
Thanks for watching.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.520
Uh, this video hasn't been very funny,

12:46.520 --> 12:48.760
because I'm nowhere near as funny as Undertale,

12:48.760 --> 12:51.000
and I thought it would be wrong to even bother to try.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.440
I started writing, and a bunch of real feelings fell out onto my keyboard.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.520
I'd like to say a very special thanks to

12:56.520 --> 12:57.640
Renslayer,

12:57.640 --> 12:58.280
Rikami,

12:58.840 --> 12:59.960
Robert Phillips.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.480
I moved the credits around so that, uh, I could thank Samuel in this video.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.600
Scarthorax.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.760
LORD OF THE ROUCHES!

13:06.760 --> 13:08.280
Scott Gwertin?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.160
Oh, God.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.080
Oh, I'm gonna look up how his name's pronounced right now.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.600
I'm sure he's mentioned it somewhere.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.760
Okay, I don't know. I can't find it.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.640
So, uh, Scott Gwertin, or Gertin, or Gertin?

13:19.640 --> 13:20.600
I think that's all of them.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.680
If it's another one, I'm—I'm so sorry.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.960
Sean Higgins,

13:23.960 --> 13:25.480
Siegfried Pinzer,

13:25.480 --> 13:26.840
Sticky Hunter,

13:26.840 --> 13:28.280
Thad Wazalewski,

13:28.280 --> 13:30.200
Two Armed Blue and Red Drapes,

13:30.200 --> 13:31.560
the S is—is gone now,

13:31.560 --> 13:32.760
Zachariah Taylor,

13:32.760 --> 13:33.800
iDragonarian,

13:33.800 --> 13:35.000
and I am Turnip.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.840
Oh, I know that look.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.280
That's the look of someone who just realized

13:40.280 --> 13:42.040
that I cooked an entire plate of spaghetti

13:42.040 --> 13:43.640
just for a one-off joke in a video

13:43.640 --> 13:45.640
mostly centered around analyzing the tastes

13:45.640 --> 13:48.360
of a fictional lesbian dinosaur scientist.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.000
But it turns out that kind of thing's all right.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.200
Undertale told me so.
