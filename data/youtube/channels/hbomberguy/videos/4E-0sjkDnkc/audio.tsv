0	2180	This video contains spoilers for UNDERTALE.
2180	3840	If you haven't played UNDERTALE yet,
3840	4840	HOW?!
5140	6200	W-WHY?!
6200	7620	You can keep watching if you want,
7620	10800	but I'm gonna spoil everything in UNDERTALE just to spite you.
10800	14400	Why haven't you given Toby Fox your MONEY?!
14400	17020	["Undertale Theme"]
17020	17920	["Undertale Theme"]
17920	19280	I really like UNDERTALE.
19280	22440	UNDERTALE and Lisa are the best RPGs I think I've ever played,
22440	25580	and the fact that they came out within a year of each other completely astounds me.
25580	26840	Hold on, did they actually do that one?
27720	28800	Yeah, they did. Okay.
28800	31120	I could talk for hours about all the things I like about it
31120	32360	and think are cool and funny,
32360	34800	the neat little touches, like how the puzzles in Hotland
34800	37840	are very obviously training simulators for killing a human,
37840	40400	complete with the same heart-breaking-apart sound effect,
45360	49160	or the way they run so much with Asgore's terrible ability to come up with names for things
49160	51840	that Asriel, which should be an incredibly cool and prophetic name,
51840	55080	is also very clearly Asgore combining his and his wife's names,
55080	58480	or the way the True Lab is a metaphor for Toby Fox's own past experiments
58480	61360	featuring aspects of the edgy Earthbound hack he made as a teenager
61360	63720	and doesn't really like being associated with anymore,
63720	66320	or the way that sign says three out of four blocks recommend you push them
66320	69320	because one of the four you encounter in the game doesn't like it,
69320	71880	or the increasingly elaborate mouse cheese bits,
71880	76720	or the way the heart you use to select menu options sprouts legs and runs away when you pick run away,
76720	79760	or the pacing and timing of just a regular old bucket...
80520	81480	...of snails,
81520	85320	or the way the king really does trim a hedge in the shape of Papyrus's face at the end,
85320	86120	or...
86120	87360	CRIME!
87360	88360	Ugh.
89200	93320	Undertale is a never-ending trip to Funtown, but I'm not really here to talk about that.
93320	97600	After all, if you've already played it, you've noticed a bunch of these for yourself, if not more,
97600	100280	and doubtlessly watched other people tell you about them, too.
100280	104600	In fact, a lot of videos about Undertale have kind of already covered the same ground over and over
104600	107000	in agonizing re-explanations of the plot
107000	110120	or engaging in bizarre theorizing about minor plot content.
111080	115880	["SANS THEME"]
115880	117640	Why is Sans called Sans?
117640	121000	Could it be because he's Sans his skin?
121000	122520	Because he's a skeleton?
122520	125160	Go to Lootcrate.com and enter the offer code LIFEISPAIN
125160	128840	to get a discount on meaningless trash that won't fill the hole inherent to the self!
128840	131480	And why is Undyne all fish-themed, but she uses energy spears?
131480	132760	That's not what fish do!
132760	136760	Clearly, Undyne is actually descended from some other energy spear-throwing fish-themed character from some other game!
136760	139880	By the way, have I talked about Five Nights at Freddy's yet?!
140440	143240	But hey, that's just a theory.
143240	152120	["FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S THEME"]
152120	155320	I want to talk about stuff that seems to not really be discussed as much.
155320	157400	The ideas the game puts forward.
157400	158680	Its philosophical impli-
158680	159960	["SANS THEME"]
159960	160920	I'm sorry, look.
160920	161960	Let's start at the beginning.
162600	163960	What is Undertale about?
164520	166760	Games can be about different things to different people.
166760	169560	But for me, at least, it's about fandom.
169560	172280	It's about cultures that form around various kinds of media,
172280	175640	and a frank examination of the effects of those cultures.
175640	181400	This is most personified in the character whose beliefs, ideas, and choices the game spends the most time exploring.
181400	182520	Dr. Alphys.
182520	186360	Initially, she seems super obsessed with anime, almost as a joke in itself.
186360	191240	Like, haha, isn't it silly that this person enjoys dumb cartoons and has opinions about them?
191240	193000	But the story digs a little deeper.
193000	197240	It becomes clear that Alphys is a tremendously anxious person for justifiable reasons,
197240	201400	who worries that they aren't a good person and aren't capable of helping others.
201400	204120	She worries a lot about even calling you to give you advice.
204120	208040	But when she starts actually talking about a show she likes, she can't contain herself.
208040	212360	She goes on tirades about the sequel, interrupts the quiz battle to talk about an episode,
212360	215320	and gets so wrapped up in explaining the story to you as she recommends it
215320	217640	that she starts interrupting her own dialogue boxes.
217640	222760	Anime is, instead of this silly thing for idiots, an opportunity to connect with someone else.
222760	225640	She recounts that the character doesn't fit in because she has cat ears,
225640	230360	which isn't normal in our world, but eventually discovers her friends accept her for who she is,
230360	235000	mirroring her own desire to be accepted, something she's initially afraid could never happen.
235000	239000	It takes the course of the entire game for her to realize that people care about her.
239000	241160	The game fully recognizes that enjoying something,
241160	244680	even something objectively dumb like anime, which it is, it's really dumb,
244680	248680	is dumb for understandable reasons, because it communicates something meaningful to us.
248680	252280	It's proof we're capable of empathy, that we see ourselves in something.
252280	256040	Even if that something is a video game or a cartoon about a girl with cat ears.
256040	259480	The character that became Metaton met Alphys through a human fan club.
259480	262360	They forged a friendship out of a mutual enjoyment of something,
262360	266200	even though Metaton clearly thinks very little of Alphys' taste in media.
266200	269720	She's a dork, and she's obsessed with these awful cartoons, but she's funny.
269720	271160	I want to see her again.
271160	273560	When Undyne is confessing her feelings for Alphys,
273560	277240	it doesn't turn out she likes her because she secretly also likes anime or anything like that.
277240	282200	In fact, she seems to hate it, but she simply loves how much she cares about the things she likes.
282200	285800	So through this character, we learn a pretty important and straightforward message.
285800	287320	Fandom can be a good thing.
287320	291000	The game is careful to point out that these people are good not in spite of,
291000	296120	but because they're capable of caring about something that might seem silly and pointless to someone else.
296120	299320	What's more human than being capable of falling in love with something?
299320	302280	It would have been so easy to make dumb jokes about people who like anime
302280	306200	too much being silly or weird and needing to tone it down to be accepted and fit in,
306200	310600	but it turns it into a heartwarming story about how it's this passion for things that makes us what we are.
310600	312920	Alphys learns to be okay with liking what she likes
312920	316680	and get over the need to judge herself for it based on what other people might think.
316680	319480	It's easy to be dismissive of people who like something we don't.
319480	323960	It's hard to appreciate a person's capacity for love if it isn't over something we love.
323960	326600	And yeah, I made fun of game theory earlier, but you know what?
326600	329160	If you like thinking about game lore and looking for possible,
329160	332760	though tenuous, connections between Undertale and EarthBound, good.
332760	335640	I'm glad you sincerely care about something enough to do that.
335640	337240	I think it's dumb to do that and you're stupid,
337240	340600	but I love you because the ability to care is inherently good.
341160	343480	I really, really like the Star Wars prequels,
343480	345800	and now you have no choice but to love me for it.
345800	346760	Gotcha!
346760	350280	To put it in layman's terms, and let's be honest, I am a rather lame man,
350280	354200	Undertale is a game about how it's good to really like spaghetti.
359640	363800	I'm more of a tagliatelle person, but you do you, cartoon skeleton.
363800	367480	So, so far, Undertale's a game about how cool fan culture can be.
367480	371240	But it doesn't just say, hey, like what you want, it's good to like things, and then go home.
371240	373560	The game's got an idealistic and oddly rare message,
373560	376920	but the game manages to be very careful about how it presents this point.
376920	379960	Toby Fox himself has a history of making fun of dumb aspects of fandoms,
379960	384040	even going so far as to compose the parody homestuck rock opera The Baby Is You
384040	386680	about a character somehow giving birth to their best friend
386680	390680	to satire the bizarre limits of weird homestuck fanfiction.
390680	393960	It's possible to go about liking something in a way that's detrimental.
393960	396360	In the early game, Toriel won't let you try to leave the ruins
396360	399000	and will actively avoid answering questions about leaving,
399000	402920	but if you press her on it, she decides to destroy the exit, ensuring you can never leave.
402920	405480	It's clear she cares a lot about you and protecting you from harm,
405480	407720	but this isn't a completely good thing, is it?
407720	410600	She's so dedicated to protecting you from possible danger
410600	414440	that she's prepared to make sure you never even run the risk of encountering it again.
414440	416760	The outside world is scary and full of risks,
416760	419080	so she decides you're better off never going out into it.
419080	420520	Toriel isn't a bad person.
420520	423400	She's just someone who cares about protecting someone precious to her
423400	425320	in a way that might be bad for them both.
425320	426520	Let's talk about Asriel.
426520	429000	As the final boss and arguable antagonist,
429000	431080	it stands to reason that the game is ultimately about
431080	433560	finding ways to challenge his perspective on the world.
433560	435800	So, what is his perspective?
435800	438600	At one point, he openly addresses the main character-slash-player,
438600	440760	saying that this whole story is a game,
440760	443800	and winning it, essentially, is putting an end to the game.
443800	446600	He fears the player being done with them and moving on.
446600	448760	His objective is to keep you playing forever,
448760	450920	so he dangles a happy ending in front of you,
450920	454040	even going so far as to give you advice on how to get better endings,
454040	455240	just to keep you going.
455240	457720	Once he becomes all-powerful, he doesn't destroy the world.
457720	459720	He fights you over and over.
459720	461720	It becomes clear over the course of the final battle
461720	464600	that all he really wants is to be with his lost sibling forever,
464600	467800	and that means doing everything he can to ensure this fight never ends.
467800	470040	You literally can't die at this point.
470040	472040	It's the Toriel encounter all over again.
472040	474920	The true run of the game largely involves helping Alphys and Asriel
474920	476600	get over something terrible that happened
476600	478440	and learn to interact with the world again
478440	481640	while being completely accepting of the things they care about.
481640	484280	There's a third Toriel-esque character in the game,
484280	485640	trying to keep someone contained
485640	487640	just so they don't have to risk things changing.
487640	489320	Think about when the barrier is destroyed.
492920	494760	Finally, everyone is on the title screen.
494760	496120	It's playing the happiest tune,
496120	499240	and you can talk to everyone in the world and give them a final goodbye.
499240	501800	Everyone has new dialogue about their impending freedom,
501800	502920	and then you leave.
502920	504920	You get a really cool sequence of all the characters
504920	506760	enjoying their freedom in the outside world.
506760	508200	You see what everyone's up to,
508200	511240	you get attacked by the Special Thanks in the hardest challenge in the game,
511240	512680	and then it finally ends.
512680	513320	It's over.
513320	516680	The ending is so final that you can't leave this screen.
516680	519000	You have to close the game to move on.
519000	520520	But what happens if you reopen it?
521960	522920	Asriel turns up.
523640	526280	He points out that everyone's gone and got their happy ending,
526280	528360	but you still have the power to ruin it.
528360	530600	If you load your save, everyone's back in the underground,
530600	533320	not even aware they had their freedom ripped away from them.
533320	535080	The game remembers, though.
535080	538120	The title screen is empty, and the music is gone.
538120	541320	The game is judging you for returning to a world you should have been done with.
541880	544520	The player becomes the final analogue to Asriel,
544520	547960	someone who likes the world so much that they want to go back to it again.
547960	550840	In my Braid video, which statistically none of you watched,
550840	553240	I talked about the idea of anti-completionism,
553240	555960	for wanting to see everything in a game just because you can,
555960	557560	for the sake of having done it.
557560	561720	Undertale does this by placing a moral weight on the decision to replay the game.
561720	564920	You're literally reversing time and retrapping everyone.
564920	567720	You're put in the position of the game's own tragic villain,
567720	571160	someone who enjoys something so much that they'd make things worse for others,
571160	574520	trap them in the underground again just so you can relive the experience of
574520	576760	meeting them, befriending them, and setting them free.
576760	579000	Interestingly enough, at the very end of the game,
579000	580760	if you choose to stay with Toriel at the end,
580760	582920	she all but chastises you, pointing out that
582920	585720	if you were really so content with just being with her,
585720	587000	you would never have left,
587000	588840	and this good thing would never have happened.
588840	591240	You'd have just been closed off eating butterscotch pie
591240	592920	and reading the same books forever.
592920	595320	Then she literally handholds you out of the game.
595320	599080	By doing this, Undertale is subtly criticizing you for being a fan of Undertale.
599080	601400	It's good to like games, but isn't there something a little bad
601400	603640	about wanting to stay in it forever?
603640	605640	If you keep getting neutral endings,
605640	607480	Flowey eventually just asks,
607480	608760	don't you have anything better to do?
609640	612120	Something better to do than completing a game over and over
612120	613720	just to see what would happen?
613720	615640	And in his other form, in the best ending,
615640	616920	before you leave the underground,
616920	619880	if you walk all the way to the first screen of the game,
619880	621160	Asriel's right there.
621400	623160	And if you keep talking to him over and over,
623800	626760	eventually, he just keeps asking the same question.
626760	629080	The Genocide Run is essentially one long commentary
629080	630440	on how the player is only doing this
630440	632120	because they want to see what happens.
632760	635080	They want more Undertale content.
635640	638040	And this is what makes them the ultimate monster,
638040	641320	not some simplistic bloodlust or hatred for all life.
641320	644840	This is also Asriel's reasoning for being so antagonistic as Flowey.
644840	646520	He's done everything so many times
646520	649400	that his sheer boredom has led him to want to see the end of everything
649400	651640	just because it's the last thing left to do.
651640	653560	If you do the Genocide Run a second time,
653560	655960	the character, who incidentally are named Brexit,
655960	658760	openly recommends that you really ought to do something else.
659400	662120	You are wracked with a perverted sentimentality.
663080	666520	I think moments like these are the ultimate point of the game's message.
666520	667720	That fandom is fine.
667720	671320	After all, it's ultimately an excuse for real contact with other people.
671320	674920	But it's important not to lose sight of the reasons why you enjoy something.
674920	678840	Undertale's harshest criticism isn't that people are stupid for making this mistake.
678840	681080	In fact, it's important to appreciate the good in people,
681080	682600	even if you think they are stupid.
682600	686360	It merely points out that it's possible to love something unwisely.
686360	689960	It's for that reason that I probably won't play Undertale again after making this video.
689960	691320	In his review of Undertale,
691320	693960	Austin Walker wrote that Undertale has a resonant message
693960	696040	that we can love games without feeling the need
696040	698360	to wring every last ounce of content out of them.
698360	701640	Luckily for me, at least one other game critic noticed the message,
701640	703240	and they happened to be the best one,
703240	705480	who's always right.
705480	708200	Getting too attached to a game about dealing with the problems
708200	710040	that come with certain kinds of attachment
710040	711320	seems like it would be missing the point.
712040	714120	If you tell Toriel you have places to go,
714120	714680	she just says,
715320	716040	see you around.
716040	718600	The ending seems slightly anticlimactic,
718600	720440	but isn't that what life is like?
720440	724200	There are memes out there about people talking about how cool it is to be raised by anime,
724200	725960	and all the cool lessons they learned.
725960	728120	It's really easy to make fun of this notion,
728120	732840	but can you imagine a world where people really did act like the heroes of the stories they liked,
732840	734440	applied all the lessons they'd learned?
735000	737320	I think that would be a magical world to live in.
737320	737960	So you're right.
738680	740280	I do have better things to do.
740280	742200	See you around, Undertale.
742200	765160	Thanks for watching.
765160	766520	Uh, this video hasn't been very funny,
766520	768760	because I'm nowhere near as funny as Undertale,
768760	771000	and I thought it would be wrong to even bother to try.
771000	774440	I started writing, and a bunch of real feelings fell out onto my keyboard.
774440	776520	I'd like to say a very special thanks to
776520	777640	Renslayer,
777640	778280	Rikami,
778840	779960	Robert Phillips.
779960	783480	I moved the credits around so that, uh, I could thank Samuel in this video.
783480	784600	Scarthorax.
784600	786760	LORD OF THE ROUCHES!
786760	788280	Scott Gwertin?
788280	789160	Oh, God.
789160	791080	Oh, I'm gonna look up how his name's pronounced right now.
792920	794600	I'm sure he's mentioned it somewhere.
795480	796760	Okay, I don't know. I can't find it.
796760	799640	So, uh, Scott Gwertin, or Gertin, or Gertin?
799640	800600	I think that's all of them.
800600	802680	If it's another one, I'm—I'm so sorry.
802680	803960	Sean Higgins,
803960	805480	Siegfried Pinzer,
805480	806840	Sticky Hunter,
806840	808280	Thad Wazalewski,
808280	810200	Two Armed Blue and Red Drapes,
810200	811560	the S is—is gone now,
811560	812760	Zachariah Taylor,
812760	813800	iDragonarian,
813800	815000	and I am Turnip.
815800	816840	Oh, I know that look.
818120	820280	That's the look of someone who just realized
820280	822040	that I cooked an entire plate of spaghetti
822040	823640	just for a one-off joke in a video
823640	825640	mostly centered around analyzing the tastes
825640	828360	of a fictional lesbian dinosaur scientist.
829320	831000	But it turns out that kind of thing's all right.
832200	834200	Undertale told me so.
