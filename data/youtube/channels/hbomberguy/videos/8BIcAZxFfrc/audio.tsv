8580	10080	Ah-ha-ha-ha!
10080	12960	Don't worry. Vaccines are perfectly safe.
12960	16300	According to me, you might notice a little prick.
16300	17640	Ah-ha-ha-ha!
17640	19100	Ah-ha-ha-ha!
19100	20520	Ah-ha!
20520	21400	Ugh.
21400	22940	Hello, and welcome back to hell.
22940	25060	I'm just vaccinating my profiteroles,
25060	27140	immunizing them against the horrendous disease
27140	29140	known only as not-enough-cream,
29160	30840	itis.
30840	32840	Unfortunately, while vaccines are great
32840	34460	at stimulating my balls,
34460	37220	in humans, they've become quite the controversial topic.
37220	39300	In the late 90s, an anti-vaccine movement
39300	40520	started to pick up steam,
40520	42220	claiming that they cause autism.
42220	44480	And the movement has plenty of washed-up celebrities
44480	46400	flushing it, including What's-His-Name
46400	47600	and that one
47600	48780	and some more.
48780	51060	Here's 45th President of the United States,
51060	53700	Donald Trump, coming out against...medicine.
53700	55360	He once famously tweet,
55380	57300	No more massive injections.
57300	59260	Tiny children are not horses.
59260	60520	I mean, of course they aren't.
60520	62220	Horses aren't even real.
62220	64260	But if there's an entire movement of people
64260	67520	with documentaries and websites and Facebook pages
67520	69820	with thousands and thousands of members
69820	72520	backed by the former U.S. president,
72520	74320	why does everyone else seem to think
74320	75520	they're obviously wrong?
75520	77700	Has the mainstream medical establishment
77700	79940	science-cucked a majority of people
79940	80980	into thinking they're safe
80980	82860	so they can keep making money selling them?
82860	84940	The vaccine debate is complex
84940	86060	and multilayered
86060	88600	and hasn't been resolved for over two decades.
88600	91060	So obviously it needs me to come and put an end to it
91060	93320	in the space of a single YouTube video
93320	94900	by doing what I'm best at,
94900	97320	destroying things with my mouth.
97320	98440	Oh!
98440	100020	Oh!
100020	101100	Oh!
101100	102140	Mm!
102140	104060	Oh!
104060	105480	Oh, hi, Mum.
105480	108480	Was I vaccinated?
108480	113320	Have you been looking into moving out lately, son?
113400	114400	Mm.
116400	118320	Now, the clever clogs among you
118320	120320	will know that there was an anti-vaccine movement
120320	123060	of sorts in the 1800s when they were first introduced,
123060	126200	but that movement died out on its own a long time ago.
126200	127200	Oh, smallpox.
127200	128740	The main argument in the modern movement
128740	130060	is that they might cause autism.
130060	133900	So let's see what, on paper, this claim is supported by.
133900	136020	Yes, I just ended a sentence with a preposition,
136020	137820	and if that annoyed you, we get it.
137820	138940	Your school was expensive.
138940	140240	We're all very happy for you.
140240	142020	Part one, the easy version,
142060	143220	in case you don't feel like watching
143220	145560	this whole fucking video.
145560	148020	In 1998, a study came out alleging a link
148020	150100	between the MMR vaccine and autism.
150100	152820	MMR vaccinates against measles, mumps, and rubella,
152820	155440	which saves kids from having to get multiple painful shots
155440	157720	and parents from having to know what rubella is.
157720	158940	It was published in the Lancet,
158940	160440	a very well-known medical journal,
160440	161860	which made it seem credible.
161860	164020	However, the paper was eventually found guilty
164020	165560	of being bad.
165560	168020	The science turned out to be bonkers,
168020	171260	and multiple other studies on literally millions of children
171300	173180	did not show that there was a link,
173180	174840	and the paper was eventually retracted
174840	176500	by the journal that published it.
176500	179180	So retracted that it literally has
179180	182460	retracted written all across every page
182460	184760	in big red letters.
184760	186460	My printer just does black and white,
186460	188180	so I've actually got an artist's impression
188180	189140	of the real version.
189140	191000	So far, that's some pretty shaky ground
191000	192260	on the anti-vaccine side,
192260	195180	but later, new evidence came out that...
195180	196800	Oh, that's it. That's all the evidence.
196800	197760	This segment is over now.
197760	199720	Part two, the existential horror of...
199720	200560	Wait, that's it?
200560	202980	No, seriously, that's all the evidence.
202980	205980	There is nothing else even remotely credible.
205980	208100	There are some fringe pet theories
208100	211760	as to what chemical in the vaccines causes the autism,
211760	214360	but since vaccines don't cause autism,
214360	217760	they're kind of putting the cart before the squid here.
217760	221140	The anti-vax movement had next to no evidence 20 years ago,
221140	222900	and now they have even less.
222900	224560	But hold on there, Daddy-O.
224560	228060	Sure, you can sum up the entire issue in 52 seconds.
228060	230140	Wow. But really, I don't think that's good enough.
230140	232100	Everyone who's anti-vax at this point
232100	233720	has probably already heard
233720	236380	and isn't convinced by the easy version.
236380	238260	I mean, if you're on the fence about vaccines,
238260	239340	you're not gonna change your mind
239340	241380	because someone told you there was a paper once
241380	242560	but it got retracted,
242560	244020	no matter how much they pitch-shift
244020	245140	their voice in post.
245140	246560	Blue crash.
246560	248720	But what if you did want to change someone's mind
248720	250300	on topics like this?
250300	252480	The data on this issue is discouraging.
252480	254140	Research shows that when someone becomes
254140	256100	personally invested in an idea,
256100	258020	they can become very closed-minded,
258020	260060	or worse, a YouTuber.
260060	262020	Political science professor Brendan Nyhan
262020	263480	and his team spent three years
263480	265560	studying how over 1,700 parents
265560	267260	reacted to various different attempts
267260	269100	to convince them to vaccinate their children
269100	271020	and found that no matter what they tried,
271020	273060	parents who started out against vaccination
273060	274260	didn't change their minds,
274260	276600	and worse, trying to correct false claims
276600	278600	about vaccines actually made some parents
278600	280260	more against vaccinating.
280260	281560	Nyhan told the New Yorker,
281560	282640	it's depressing.
282640	284560	We were definitely depressed.
284560	286900	Now, as a fellow fan of logic and reason,
286940	288860	I'm also doing great,
288860	291280	but in today's particular, shall we say,
291280	293140	socioeconomic climate,
293140	295060	it's extra pressing that we figure out
295060	296820	how to get everyone on the same page
296820	298360	with regards to public health.
298360	299900	So the purpose of this video isn't just
299900	302240	to point out a group that's wrong about something.
302240	303600	The real question is,
303600	305600	when someone is wrong about something,
305600	308060	not just this, how do you change their mind?
308060	310600	Now, personally, I'm not sure how to do that.
310600	313180	If it was easy for humans to change their mind
313180	316180	about stuff, then this video wouldn't need to exist,
316180	318540	would it? But maybe we'll find some answers
318540	320420	by exploring what convinced people
320420	322420	vaccines might be dangerous in the first place.
322420	325580	We should probably begin with that old 1998 study
325580	327180	because, let's be honest,
327180	330080	how many people on either side of this discussion
330080	331380	have actually read it?
331380	333840	People don't read scientific papers.
333840	336260	They check out the blogs or videos of people
336260	337420	who they already agree with,
337420	340080	and they tell them what the science said.
340080	341420	And I mean, same.
341420	344300	I heard all the other people say the science was bad,
344300	345840	and I believed them.
345880	347800	And the anti-vax people probably just believed
347800	349500	whoever told them it was true.
349500	351660	So to be unbiased about this,
351660	353920	let's really start at the beginning.
353920	355760	Look at the original paper.
355760	357760	That's the wrong page.
357760	360760	Let's actually read this old paper
360760	362800	and see what it has to say
362800	365380	and come to an honest conclusion about its findings.
365380	366880	Five minutes later.
366880	368160	What the fuck?
368160	370540	This is why people are against vaccines?
370540	373120	This is the worst fucking paper I've ever read in my life!
373120	378280	♪♪
378280	381160	♪♪
381160	382700	Ah.
382700	384400	Right, let's talk about the study.
384400	386540	I'm calling it the study because its real title
386540	388820	was Ileal Lymphoid Nodular Hyperplasia,
388820	390080	Nonspecific Colitis,
390080	392440	and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children,
392440	394080	which is a bit of a tongue twister.
394080	396540	I had to do a not insignificant amount of Googling
396540	399440	to find out whether it's pronounced Ileal or I-leal.
399440	401040	Don't know why I bothered. If I got it wrong,
401040	402320	it's not like you would have noticed.
402320	405140	The paper's lead author is Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
405140	406860	I'm sorry. There's a mistake in my script.
406860	410560	The paper's lead author is disgraced ex-Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
410560	412440	Wakefield is seen by many as the founder
412440	413980	of the modern anti-vaccine movement
413980	416520	since he was behind the paper that started the whole thing.
416520	418680	Let's keep an eye on that guy. Oh, fucking!
418680	421020	The smoke machine occasionally goes off on its own
421020	422900	for no reason, and I can't be bothered to get up.
422900	425240	The paper's supposed purpose was to investigate
425240	427140	a connection between bowel disorders
427140	428900	and developmental issues in children,
428900	430980	in particular targeting signs of autism.
431060	433060	So first off, what's a colitis?
433060	434720	Right, uh, hold on.
434720	436980	Okay, colitis is inflammation of the colon,
436980	438900	one of the main symptoms of bowel diseases
438900	440560	like Crohn's disease, for example.
440560	442600	Colitis. By the way, we're gonna use words
442600	444600	like bowel, colon, and intestine
444600	446180	interchangeably in this video.
446180	448300	Don't let it confuse you. They're mostly the same thing.
448300	449940	If you're a doctor, pretend you didn't hear that.
449940	452140	The paper says non-specific colitis
452140	455100	because it's not looking for specific kinds of inflammation.
455100	456680	It's looking at whatever inflammation
456680	459340	these children happen to have and seeing how they compare
459340	460700	because maybe they're all linked,
460700	463000	and maybe they're even linked to the autism.
463000	466340	According to Wakefield, he just happened to notice
466340	469580	a lot of kids with both autism and bowel disorders,
469580	472340	and he launched the study to investigate a possible link.
472340	473340	Ah!
473340	475160	But what does all that have to do with vaccines?
475160	477200	I mean, surely it must have found something
477200	479300	for it to have caused all this controversy.
479300	481040	Well, allow me to list the paper's
481040	483880	highly scientific findings.
483880	486800	Some of the parents of the children in the study
486800	490260	think they remember the autism symptoms
490260	494500	starting after the MMR vaccine.
494500	495920	No, really, that's it.
495920	496880	Findings.
496880	499960	Onset of behavioral symptoms was associated by the parents
499960	502580	with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.
502580	504580	For literally decades, right,
504580	506380	I've been hearing about this paper,
506380	509120	and I've assumed that there must have been something there,
509120	512760	like something to at least explore or discuss or debunk.
512760	515120	Everyone lost their fucking minds over it,
515120	518660	so surely there's something, and I finally go and read it,
518660	521580	and it's just a bunch of fucking parents' opinions.
521580	523080	There's just nothing there!
523080	525080	I can't fucking believe this!
525080	527080	♪♪
527080	528500	Like, seriously, the disconnect
528500	530620	between the attempts at real science
530620	533160	and the stuff the parents think they remember
533160	535120	is, like, so jarring.
535120	537620	Like, next to colonoscopies and biopsies
537620	540540	and graphs of urinary excretions,
540540	542360	you'll suddenly get sentences like...
542360	545100	He received a dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine,
545100	546820	the day after which his mother described
546820	549020	a striking deterioration in his behavior
549020	551440	that she did link with the immunization.
551440	553560	A note from your mother isn't science.
553560	555400	It's how you get out of P.E.
555400	558140	I'm sorry, coach. I didn't really have polio.
558140	560600	Ah, maybe some home decorating will relax me.
560600	562940	I love this poster because I'm smart,
562940	565020	and now all my guests will know I'm smart.
565020	567320	I have tons of guests. I'm a party animal.
567320	569360	I have a charisma of at least six.
570360	571360	Uh.
571360	575360	-♪♪
575360	579360	-♪♪
579360	583360	-♪♪
583360	585560	-♪♪
585560	587780	I wonder why the economists interviewed Contrapoints
587780	588780	and not me.
588780	590780	There. Perfect.
590780	592560	Does that look all right to you?
592560	593900	No, Rachel, don't wave the camera.
593900	595060	That's not how people communicate.
595060	596940	Page three of the study provides a table
596940	599440	listing each child's behavioral diagnosis,
599440	602100	largely autism, and also what their parents identified
602100	603440	as their exposure,
603440	605600	the thing which, in their opinion,
605600	607180	caused the diagnosis.
607180	609260	Of course, most of them blame the vaccine.
609260	611020	Now, while a bunch of opinions
611020	614760	are about as useful in science as a bath made of teeth,
614760	616600	we might as well explore how someone
616600	618440	might end up having that opinion.
618440	621020	♪♪
621020	622600	It's actually really common for us to...
622600	623600	Actually, hey, Angie?
623600	624600	Yeah?
624600	626300	Could you draw me as a ferret, please?
626340	628620	Okay. Why?
628620	629960	I will not explain why.
629960	631740	It's actually really common for us to assume
631740	633920	two things that happened to us around the same time
633920	635420	must be caused by one another.
635420	638540	That's how we as ape people whose fur fell off one day
638540	640120	think about things with our tiny,
640120	642000	godless little monkey brains.
642000	644040	If you ate some strange new berries
644040	645340	and got sick that day,
645340	647700	you're basically programmed to connect the two
647700	649160	for the sake of your own survival.
649160	650620	This is the one in ten times
650620	652500	that evolutionary psychology is real.
652500	653740	The rest are fake, Malcolm,
653740	655500	but these correlations we make in our heads
655540	657700	between events aren't necessarily true.
657700	659120	It might not have been the berries.
659120	660820	It could have been all the budget energy drinks
660820	662160	you import from Thailand.
662160	665580	You know what? Maybe you can have too much carabao.
665580	667460	Another big problem here is how humans
667460	669280	relate to spans of time,
669280	670780	just like how under quarantine
670780	673040	you might not even notice four months passing
673040	674860	because nothing happens anymore.
674860	676540	If someone coughs on you today
676540	679000	and later in the evening you start to feel a bit sick,
679000	681120	a lot of people might remember being coughed on
681120	682580	and assume that's how they got it,
682580	685440	but illnesses can take days or weeks to incubate.
685440	687740	Maybe you don't remember the time you got coughed on
687740	689620	two weeks ago by the guy who was delivering
689620	691160	the last crate of energy drinks.
691160	693540	Oh, carabao, why is it so hard to quit you?
693540	695000	Win football tickets?
695000	696960	I can't wait to be in a crowd of people again.
696960	698040	Ah-ha-ha-ha!
698040	699960	The table claims some of the parents
699960	702200	noticed the symptoms a few weeks, days,
702200	704820	or even hours after getting the vaccine,
704820	706500	but I do have to wonder how easy it is
706500	708660	for someone to recall something as complex
708660	710900	as the exact date of the onset
710900	713100	of a child's behavioral symptoms.
713100	715100	A BBC documentary from back in the day
715100	717360	interviewed a parent and they said on camera
717360	720860	that their son became autistic overnight after the vaccine.
720860	722280	What happened to your other son?
722280	724780	Overnight. He had the fever, the high temperature.
724780	726820	Literally overnight. He was never the same again.
726820	728280	Even the interviewer was like,
728280	730480	literally? Literally overnight?
730480	731900	Like, are you sure?
731900	733820	The signs of autism appear gradually
733820	735280	and grow over time.
735280	737020	When parents first take notice,
737020	739360	there could easily be other signs they missed.
739360	741320	Another better documentary about all this
741320	743440	we'll get to later actually found parents
743440	746200	who realized they'd made this exact mistake.
746200	748240	Stacey and Damien no longer believe
748240	750780	that their daughter's autism was caused by MMR.
750780	753620	After researching and remembering Rebecca as a baby,
753620	756080	they realized that she had already shown symptoms
756080	757700	before she was vaccinated.
757700	760000	Parents don't necessarily notice the symptoms
760000	761360	until they're fairly obvious,
761360	763580	but that doesn't mean the symptoms weren't there
763580	766000	or their child wasn't autistic beforehand.
766000	767740	I'm bringing this up because it's important
767740	770160	to make the distinction that whenever someone describes
770160	772380	something like their child's first symptom,
772380	775040	what they are really describing is the first symptom
775040	776740	they personally noticed.
776740	778460	Here's a timeline of the first two years
778460	779620	of a child's development.
779620	781120	Statistically, the average age
781120	783780	that symptoms of autism become noticeable to parents
783780	785920	is around 12 to 18 months.
785920	788540	Children in the UK receive a dose of the MMR vaccine
788540	790700	from between 12 to 15 months.
790700	792580	Isn't it possible that these parents
792580	794660	are blaming a coincidental event?
794660	797460	You can even see evidence that this happens in the paper
797460	798880	because some of the other parents
798880	801560	blame other totally coincidental events.
801560	805020	One of them blames their child's autism on an ear infection
805020	808220	they got a week before they first noticed the symptoms.
808220	811020	Do ear infections cause autism now?
811020	812440	No.
812440	813980	No. Of course not,
813980	815720	but if it was the only other thing
815720	817600	that you remembered happening to your child,
817600	818980	you can see how someone might end up
818980	820240	assuming they're related.
820240	821900	Before this study was released,
821900	824500	there were a few very small clusters of parents
824500	827500	that thought vaccines caused autism or other illnesses.
827500	831040	JABS, the Justice, Awareness, and Basic Support Group,
831040	833540	wow, they really worked hard to make their name say JABS,
833540	835720	had been around for a few years beforehand.
835720	837680	The founder of JABS, Jackie Fletcher,
837680	839460	asserts to this day that her son
839460	841560	suddenly became severely autistic
841560	843800	ten days after his MMR vaccination
843800	845880	and has frequently tried to sue the government
845880	848380	and MMR manufacturers for money over it.
848380	850800	It's important to recognize that statistically,
850800	853140	even if vaccines are perfectly safe,
853160	855860	you're going to get a small amount of parents like her
855860	857880	who are convinced that vaccines are harmful
857880	859540	because they got one right before
859540	860920	something like this happened.
860920	862760	Before there was a scientific paper
862760	865460	and thousands of news pieces telling them to,
865460	867460	there really weren't that many parents
867460	869720	of autistic children who blamed the vaccine.
869720	872880	According to a pro-JABS piece made in May 2002
872880	874020	when the scare was happening,
874020	875440	there were thousands of members,
875440	877140	but before all that, there were only about
877140	879060	30 sets of parents at best,
879060	880780	and speaking of groups being too small
880780	882280	to be statistically meaningful,
882300	884380	another big problem, or to put it another way,
884380	886760	a small problem, is sample size.
886760	888920	Ha ha ha, please hold your applause until the end.
888920	891420	On its own, a study of a small sample size
891420	893800	like 12 children can't prove anything
893800	895600	about the rest of a population.
895600	897220	I've made this point about people drawing
897220	899840	sweeping conclusions from small studies before.
899840	901640	However, it's important to understand
901640	904100	sample size criticisms in the proper context.
904100	906900	Studies on small groups happen all the time in science
906900	907780	for a good reason.
907780	909700	They're often called pilot studies,
909700	911060	and they're useful for figuring out
911060	912640	how a bigger study should work
912640	914180	in preparation for the real thing
914180	915900	or for checking to see if there's something
915900	917720	worth looking into in the first place.
917720	920140	A fraction of parents of the tens of millions
920140	921560	of children who've had this vaccine
921560	923740	saying they think there might be a connection
923740	926780	is at best grounds to do a better study
926780	928820	on a bigger group of children to find out
928820	931120	if this connection actually exists.
931120	932860	We're going to come back to this later
932860	934780	because someone had the opportunity
934780	935960	to do one of those,
935960	937820	and what they did with that opportunity
937820	939960	is very interesting.
939980	941480	That was an awful take. Let me do that again.
941480	944780	In summary, the science is really bad.
944780	945900	It's bonkers.
945900	949280	The study even admits it doesn't prove anything at the end.
949280	950700	We did not prove an association
950700	952920	between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine
952920	954580	and the syndrome described.
954580	956300	The next sentence is hilarious.
956300	958040	Virological studies are underway
958040	960000	that may help to resolve this issue.
960000	962760	The issue being that they don't have any proof.
962760	964540	In science, it's expected to admit
964540	965960	the limitations of your study.
965960	968180	Papers and medical journals have high standards
968200	970440	for what constitutes solid proof.
970440	973060	However, Wakefield is using this as a shield.
973060	974620	By hiding behind the defense
974620	976660	that he hasn't claimed to prove anything,
976660	978820	he can then speculate about a lot of things
978820	980240	he hasn't proved.
980240	983000	For example, these children appear to share similar,
983000	985240	though nonspecific, bowel problems.
985240	987580	I say appeared because, well, we'll come back to that,
987580	990000	but Wakefield takes this vague collection
990000	992340	of similar things and concludes with the theory
992340	993720	that could make his career,
993720	995840	that the vaccine may cause autism
995840	998060	and it happens through the bowels.
998060	1000600	We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children
1000600	1003480	that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.
1003480	1005180	In most cases, onset of symptoms
1005180	1008060	was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunization.
1008060	1010700	Further investigations are needed to examine the syndrome
1010700	1013280	and its possible relation to this vaccine.
1013280	1016160	In literally the final sentences of the paper,
1016160	1018320	Wakefield invents a new disease
1018320	1020860	that combines bowel disorders and autism
1020860	1023660	and then speculates that MMR vaccination
1023660	1026840	might cause the disease he just made up.
1026860	1030360	This is absolutely buck wild, as some would put it.
1030360	1033040	It's like medical fan fiction.
1033040	1035700	Sure, he admitted it just may be
1035700	1038580	and said we need more research to prove anything,
1038580	1041120	but now his made-up disease
1041120	1043420	is in a published scientific paper
1043420	1045460	in one of the most prestigious medical journals
1045460	1046380	in the world.
1046380	1048800	Journalists with little to no scientific knowledge
1048800	1050560	go on to report on this paper
1050560	1053060	as if it's discovering this new disease.
1053060	1054680	Doctors at the Royal Free Hospital
1054680	1056480	believe they may have discovered a link
1056500	1058240	between the combination vaccine
1058240	1060780	and a bowel disease that can progress to autism.
1060780	1061880	What are you talking about?
1061880	1063380	He admitted he didn't prove anything
1063380	1065420	and then wildly speculated at the end.
1065420	1065920	No!
1065920	1068220	There is one last really weird thing
1068220	1070000	about this paper we haven't mentioned yet,
1070000	1072060	which most people don't seem to mention,
1072060	1073600	which I find a little bit weird
1073600	1075840	and indicates that no one has actually read it.
1075840	1077940	Towards the end of the paper,
1077940	1080640	ugh, Wakefield tries to find other papers
1080640	1082560	that kind of support his findings,
1082560	1085320	so he really has to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
1085320	1088480	Fudenberg noted that for 15 of 20 autistic children,
1088480	1091800	the first symptoms developed within a week of vaccination.
1091800	1092720	Wow!
1092720	1094720	That's a really interesting thing to...
1094720	1095960	urk, isn't it?
1095960	1098240	We should probably actually go read Fudenberg's paper
1098240	1100240	and see what it has to say for itself.
1103320	1106160	Fudenberg's 1996 paper cited here is from
1106160	1109080	Biotherapy, a fringe journal for quacks
1109080	1111720	that actually went out of business two years later.
1111720	1113640	The paper is a pilot study on the effects
1113640	1115000	of a substance called
1115000	1118640	dialysable lymphocyte extract on children with autism.
1118640	1121040	In addition to alleging that several of the children
1121040	1123840	had become autistic within a week of getting vaccinated,
1123840	1125040	are you ready for this?
1125040	1128240	Fudenberg claimed that this extract he'd created
1128240	1130480	could cure autism.
1130480	1132600	Of the 22 with classic autism,
1132600	1135800	10 became normal in that they were mainstreamed in school
1135800	1138600	and clinical characteristics were fully normalized.
1138600	1140720	Became normal!
1140720	1142080	Holy shit!
1142120	1144400	And you want to know something funny?
1144400	1146520	You want to know something funny?
1146520	1148920	At the time that the study was published,
1148920	1152040	Fudenberg didn't have a medical license.
1152040	1154280	It was revoked the year before
1154280	1157120	because he was caught stealing controlled substances
1157120	1159440	from his job for personal use.
1159440	1161840	The South Carolina Medical Board found him guilty
1161840	1164320	of engaging in dishonorable, unethical,
1164320	1166040	or unprofessional conduct.
1166040	1168360	He admitted he'd done it in the hearing too.
1168360	1170400	So he got caught stealing drugs,
1170400	1173640	admitted it, got fired, lost all credibility,
1173640	1175640	probably wasn't even allowed within 100 yards
1175640	1178360	of a stethoscope, and then a year later,
1178360	1181240	he cured autism, according to him.
1181240	1183920	And you know he's trustworthy because he admitted
1183920	1185880	to stealing all those medical supplies.
1185880	1190160	What I'm trying to say here is ex-Dr. Hugh Fudenberg's paper
1190160	1194120	is one of the most obviously bullshit things I've ever read.
1194120	1196000	And Wakefield had to cite it
1196000	1198440	to create a precedent for his findings.
1198480	1200480	This is the best he could get.
1200480	1201880	You can see why it's a bit weird
1201880	1203280	no one brings this up, right?
1203280	1204840	In scientific circles,
1204840	1206960	everyone who read Wakefield's paper,
1206960	1210360	or worse, bothered to check the sources it cited,
1210360	1213080	had, you know, a few minor concerns.
1213080	1215960	It was so concerning that The Lancet published
1215960	1219400	in the same issue a response to the paper.
1219400	1223200	Vaccine adverse events, causal or coincidental.
1223200	1225080	It points out numerous problems,
1225080	1227000	some of which we've discussed here already,
1227000	1229520	and has some words to say about fear-mongering
1229520	1231200	about vaccines like this.
1231200	1232680	Vaccine safety concerns,
1232680	1234920	such as that reported by Wakefield and colleagues,
1234920	1237200	may snowball into societal tragedies
1237200	1240640	when the media and the public confuse association
1240640	1243680	with causality and shun immunization.
1243680	1245720	This would be tragic because passion
1245720	1249280	would then conquer reason and the facts again in the UK.
1249280	1251400	This commentary would probably have seemed
1251400	1254160	darkly apocalyptic at the time,
1254200	1255200	but in retrospect,
1255200	1257560	it was a shockingly accurate prediction.
1257560	1258680	Like, they knew!
1258680	1260200	They fucking warned us!
1260200	1262920	So even before the paper was in the public eye,
1262920	1265560	other doctors and scientists were looking at it
1265560	1267920	and saying, this ain't it, chief.
1267920	1269640	Is that still a current reference?
1269640	1272040	I've aged 10 years in the last two weeks.
1272040	1273160	Time is meaningless.
1273160	1275600	But despite a lot of obvious concerns
1275600	1276960	and clear weaknesses,
1276960	1279400	Wakefield published the study anyway,
1279400	1281080	and then, and this is weird,
1281080	1284040	he immediately held a press conference about it.
1284080	1287280	This isn't something that anyone normally does in science,
1287280	1290280	especially not after publishing a five-page study
1290280	1292160	that admits it didn't prove anything.
1292160	1295440	The paper was so small and its findings so insignificant
1295440	1297480	that it barely even qualifies as a paper.
1297480	1300200	In fact, it was published in the Lancet as an early report.
1300200	1302520	See, the top left corner?
1302520	1303520	Zoom in on it.
1303520	1304520	It's there.
1306160	1307400	You gotta be quicker on the drill than that.
1307400	1308960	Holding a press conference for this
1308960	1310640	is something you do if you want attention
1310640	1312400	for your controversial paper,
1312400	1314160	not if you're trying to do science,
1314160	1316600	and here's where the whole thing really started.
1316600	1317920	During the press conference,
1317920	1320480	Wakefield pretended his study had discovered
1320480	1322000	a risk so earth-shaking
1322000	1324880	that the government should stop using the MMR vaccine
1324880	1326640	and replace it with measles, mumps,
1326640	1329000	and rubella vaccines given separately.
1329000	1330960	One more case of this is too many.
1330960	1333400	We put children at no greater risk
1333400	1337240	if we dissociate those vaccines into three,
1337240	1340640	but we may be averting the possibility of this problem.
1340680	1342800	This is the moment that changed everything.
1342800	1345240	Wakefield told a room full of reporters
1345240	1346520	that based on his study,
1346520	1349160	he felt the MMR vaccine could be putting millions
1349160	1350400	of children at risk.
1350400	1353080	The mainstream media were in love with the notion
1353080	1354800	that the paper had found something,
1354800	1357840	so they ran with it all the way into hell.
1357840	1363320	♪♪
1363320	1364720	The paper was bad, sure,
1364720	1366560	but mass movements against vaccines
1366560	1368640	don't start because of the release of a paper.
1368640	1370640	Like we discussed, people don't read papers.
1370640	1372640	I didn't read it for, like, 20 years,
1372640	1374240	and you know who else didn't read it?
1374240	1376080	Every journalist who reported on it,
1376080	1378080	but when a doctor publicly says
1378080	1380640	the government is putting millions of children at risk
1380640	1382840	with a vaccine rolled out nationwide,
1382840	1384720	even if his paper's a load of old shit,
1384720	1386000	you gotta report on that.
1386000	1389000	The possibility was too tantalizing to ignore.
1389000	1391240	It's really hard to get across how unavoidable
1391240	1392240	the issue was.
1392240	1394760	If you even glanced at a TV or a newspaper
1394760	1395960	in the mid-2000s,
1395960	1398000	it was MMR might cause autism
1398000	1400920	or it was Princess Diana is Still Dead.
1400920	1404040	Measles kills thousands of people every year,
1404040	1407240	but today, questions about the vaccine.
1407240	1410360	Vaccination could be linked to a new side effect,
1410360	1412920	a combination of bowel disease and autism.
1412920	1415040	Hundreds of articles, news pieces,
1415040	1416440	and documentaries were made
1416440	1419040	about the potential significance of this study.
1419040	1421000	They rarely show or discuss the contents
1421000	1422120	of the paper itself,
1422120	1424680	but the doctor behind it came out against MMR.
1424680	1426000	There's a potential link.
1426000	1427600	There's a potential link, everybody.
1428160	1430560	And do you know what happens when every news resource
1430560	1433840	is screaming about the potential risks of a vaccine?
1433840	1436480	You make millions of people terrified
1436480	1438080	to vaccinate their children.
1438080	1439920	I was growing up during the MMR scare,
1439920	1441800	and the main thing I remember from the TV news
1441800	1444880	at that time was big shots of pointy needles
1444880	1447760	and children screaming as they get given an injection
1447760	1449600	and ominous voiceovers saying,
1449600	1451600	oh, these vaccines might be dangerous.
1451600	1454080	It's almost like TV deliberately scares people
1454080	1455720	for ratings because that's how this works.
1455720	1456720	That's the entire point.
1456720	1458440	If you want to know why thousands of parents
1458440	1460640	think MMR gave their children autism,
1460640	1463120	it's not because they came to that conclusion on their own.
1463120	1465680	We've seen how before all of this reporting happened,
1465680	1468080	only a teeny tiny minority of parents
1468080	1470520	made the connection between autism and the vaccine.
1470520	1473320	They could only find seven parents of autistic children
1473320	1475920	who blamed MMR in the original study even.
1475920	1478720	The only thing that changed was how many news outlets
1478720	1481160	were telling everyone the vaccine might cause it.
1481160	1483000	After years of the media telling them
1483000	1484080	it could have been the jab,
1484080	1486480	some parents started to believe it.
1486480	1489120	The symptoms started to appear when he was two,
1489120	1491960	soon after he had his MMR.
1491960	1494520	This is the age at which autism usually develops,
1494520	1497160	but his parents don't believe it's coincidence.
1497160	1499280	His parents didn't believe it was a coincidence
1499280	1501360	because every news resource was telling them
1501360	1503400	it might have something to do with the vaccine,
1503400	1505960	and trusting that the media had done the work
1505960	1507800	and knew what they were talking about,
1507800	1510000	they believed what they were being told.
1510000	1513320	The end result of publications and broadcasts like this
1513320	1516080	was a lot of concerned parents,
1516080	1518280	a lot of unvaccinated children,
1518280	1521280	and a whole lot of new cases of measles.
1521280	1524200	With inoculation rates falling to dangerous levels.
1524200	1527240	In Ireland, the debate over MMR has been fueled
1527240	1529480	still further by a measles outbreak
1529480	1531280	which killed three children.
1531280	1532760	Whatever the official evidence,
1532760	1535640	which rejected a link between MMR and autism,
1535640	1538200	fewer parents were prepared to take a risk.
1538200	1539680	I wonder why that might be.
1539680	1541840	Could it be because every time you turned on the television,
1541840	1543400	there's footage of a screaming child
1543400	1544520	with a needle in its arm?
1544520	1547360	Once literally every other doctor had come out saying,
1547360	1549600	look, there's no proof. Please stop doing this,
1549600	1552000	a lot of journalists got really defensive suddenly
1552000	1553480	and started putting out pieces like,
1553480	1556560	no, I will not stop reporting scaremongering bullshit.
1556560	1558840	Wait, the same journalist wrote both of these.
1558840	1560760	She just spent like six months of her career
1560760	1562760	complaining about people criticizing her.
1562760	1563400	Amazing.
1563400	1566240	So what was Andrew Wakefield doing during all this?
1566240	1568400	Well, he was getting interviewed nonstop
1568400	1571240	and having clips played in almost all of these news pieces.
1571240	1572480	He was like a celebrity,
1572480	1574440	especially to the growing list of parents
1574440	1576520	newly convinced by the media's reporting
1576520	1579160	that he'd discovered why their children had autism.
1579160	1581000	For a couple of years, Andrew Wakefield
1581000	1583560	was the sort of guy who you filmed in slow motion
1583560	1585360	in black and white.
1585360	1586240	Holy shi-
1586240	1588280	Wakefield used his time in the spotlight
1588280	1590240	to spread even more doubt about MMR
1590240	1592360	and continue to repeat the recommendation
1592360	1594920	that parents get separate vaccines instead.
1594920	1597400	At the press conference, in interviews in the aftermath,
1597400	1600400	and four whole times on a 23-minute videotape
1600400	1601520	he sent to journalists,
1601560	1603440	he claims he thinks separate vaccines
1603440	1605160	would avoid the risk of autism.
1605160	1606920	Andrew Wakefield says he appealed
1606920	1609360	to the chief medical officer more than six months ago
1609360	1611880	to give worried parents the option of the single vaccine.
1611880	1613520	My recommendation has been
1613520	1615560	that children should continue to be vaccinated,
1615560	1616800	but to separate the vaccines,
1616800	1618680	there is sufficient anxiety in my own mind
1618680	1621680	over the safety, the long-term safety of the polyvalent,
1621680	1624840	that is the MMR vaccination in combination,
1624840	1626600	that I think that it should be suspended
1626600	1629040	in favor of the single vaccines.
1629040	1632120	There is sufficient anxiety in my own mind
1632120	1635200	that it would be sensible to divide them
1635200	1636880	into separate doses.
1636880	1639040	There is sufficient anxiety
1639040	1641440	that the parents must have a choice
1641440	1642480	of how they protect their children.
1642480	1643680	It's really kind of interesting
1643680	1646200	that while the modern anti-vaccine movement
1646200	1649280	insists that all vaccines are dangerous in some way,
1649280	1651600	the guy who started the fear and anxiety
1651600	1653640	that led to this was pro-vaccine.
1653640	1655560	We advocate vaccination.
1655560	1657360	This is not anti-vaccine in any way.
1657360	1659440	He was really specific about the fact
1659440	1661800	that he thought parents should keep vaccinating,
1661800	1664280	just that they should use alternatives to MMR.
1664280	1667600	The single vaccines are likely in this context
1667600	1668280	to be safer.
1668280	1670320	Remember that disease he speculated about
1670320	1671480	at the end of his paper?
1671480	1673760	That there might be some kind of bowel disorder
1673760	1676680	caused by MMR that then leads to autism?
1676680	1678640	This came up in the media a lot as well.
1678640	1681800	Could the NMR jab be causing a strange,
1681800	1683880	new kind of bowel disease
1683880	1686160	that was turning the children autistic?
1686160	1688840	Measles, mumps, and rubella given together
1688840	1690240	may be too much for the immune system
1690240	1691400	of some children to handle.
1691400	1693960	There is a bowel disease, a new syndrome
1693960	1696520	associated with regressive autism,
1696520	1698200	and that that may be related to MMR.
1698200	1700680	Eventually, he even came up with a name for it.
1700680	1702840	Autistic enterocolitis.
1702840	1705320	Wakefield's theory, when he tries to explain it,
1705320	1707760	is that the almost-dead measles virus
1707760	1709280	present in the MMR vaccine
1709280	1712320	can get stuck in the intestine...somehow,
1712320	1713760	causing all that inflammation
1713760	1715600	they apparently found in the study.
1715600	1716880	More on that later.
1716880	1719360	Which leads to it not digesting certain foods
1719360	1721200	like bread and milk properly,
1721200	1723200	turning them into, his words,
1723200	1725240	a morphine-like substance
1725240	1727400	which then leaks out of the bowel
1727400	1730080	and into the brain, causing autism.
1730080	1732080	Morphine-like substances from the gut
1732080	1734080	that you and I produce in our diet
1734080	1735920	from milk and wheat
1735920	1739320	are actually getting access through that leaky gut
1739320	1741320	into the developing brain.
1741320	1744720	This theory is, uh, very strange.
1744720	1746760	One of the many strange things about it
1746760	1748480	is that it specifically implicates
1748480	1750480	the measles part of the vaccine.
1750480	1752520	If measles, when it's in a vaccine,
1752520	1754840	can cause a syndrome that leads to autism,
1754840	1757080	how could you possibly be so certain
1757080	1759760	that the separate vaccine for measles would be safe?
1759760	1762320	The risk of this particular syndrome developing
1762320	1764680	is related to the combined vaccine,
1764680	1767680	the MMR, rather than the single vaccines.
1767680	1769120	Okay, sure, but why?
1769120	1771560	On what basis are you saying that, Andy?
1771560	1774360	How could a doctor so easily make that recommendation?
1774440	1778360	And it may be that giving the measles on its own
1778360	1781680	reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing.
1781680	1783080	He just keeps saying it.
1783080	1785120	My opinion, again,
1785120	1788640	is that the monovalent, the single vaccines,
1788640	1790000	measles, mumps, and rubella,
1790000	1793040	are likely in this context to be safer
1793040	1794800	than the polyvalent vaccine.
1794800	1797440	That's the MMR vaccine.
1797440	1798760	There's actually a real reason
1798760	1801040	why he recommended the separate vaccine so much.
1801040	1802360	Uh, we'll get to that later.
1802360	1804040	Here's the one example I could find
1804040	1806400	of an interviewer asking him to explain themself.
1806400	1810640	But even supposing the measles element of the MMR vaccine
1810640	1814600	had deposited the virus in the intestinal tissue
1814600	1816760	of these children,
1816760	1820800	a single jab of measles might do the same.
1820800	1822640	Theoretically, it might.
1822640	1824720	But you're advocating a jab,
1824720	1826000	single jabs instead of MMR?
1826000	1826920	I said theoretically.
1826920	1828240	Oh, only theoretically.
1828240	1829880	Well, that's fine, then.
1829880	1831240	What a great scientist.
1831240	1833160	But if you say it may do,
1833200	1835520	then how can you advocate a single jab of measles,
1835520	1837720	even if there's only a theoretical possibility
1837720	1840120	that it might damage a child?
1840120	1841720	While that question mark exists,
1841720	1843040	at the very least,
1843040	1846080	parents deserve a choice of how they protect their children
1846080	1847240	against these infections,
1847240	1849480	whether it be with the MMR vaccine
1849480	1851080	or whether it is with the single vaccine.
1851080	1852680	He always finds a way to pivot back
1852680	1856120	to how in the midst of all of these questions and concerns,
1856120	1857120	which he started,
1857120	1858760	parents should at least have the option
1858760	1860040	of a separate vaccine.
1860040	1862280	Honestly, you'd think he was some kind of salesman
1862280	1863680	for alternative vaccines.
1863680	1865560	Autistic enterocolitis is not
1865560	1868760	and has never been accepted as real by gastroenterology,
1868760	1871280	the field specializing in the stomach and intestines,
1871280	1874680	but an ordinary person, or worse, a journalist,
1874680	1876160	might not understand it enough
1876160	1877800	to know that it doesn't make sense.
1877800	1881800	So, of course, it got reported as an interesting new idea.
1881800	1884760	It was a bold and controversial theory.
1884760	1886520	That's an interesting choice of words.
1886520	1888440	This piece by that really defensive lady,
1888440	1891120	Melanie Phillips, one of the most well-paid journalists
1891120	1893680	in Britain at the time, is still continuing to spread it
1893680	1896800	in this very article about being criticized for spreading it.
1896800	1899760	She calls it a unique gut-brain disease.
1899760	1901640	When you imagine a new disease,
1901640	1903680	of course it's gonna sound unique, Melanie.
1903680	1905720	No red flags popping up around the fact
1905720	1908360	that no disease has ever functioned like this before?
1908360	1909720	No? Fucking hell.
1909720	1912720	This completely unproved, unique, bold,
1912720	1916480	and controversial theory was irresistible to Phillips,
1916480	1918720	a bigot of the year award-winning writer
1918720	1920880	famous for also denying climate change,
1920880	1922540	calling Obama an Islamist,
1922540	1927000	describing a group of liberal Jews as Jews for genocide,
1927000	1930340	and opposing both Irish independence and gay rights,
1930340	1933140	which she dismissed as an attack on the traditional family
1933140	1934800	by cultural Marxism.
1934800	1937680	It's not shocking that Phillips was wrong about MMR.
1937680	1939520	It's her job to be wrong about everything.
1939520	1942220	The truly shocking thing about this is that for once,
1942220	1944440	the entire rest of the British media
1944440	1946060	were on the same side as her,
1946060	1949320	uncritically regurgitating everything Wakefield said
1949320	1950700	to millions of people.
1950720	1953360	This completely irresponsible reporting
1953360	1955780	caused fear, vaccine hesitancy,
1955780	1957900	kick-started an anti-vaccine movement
1957900	1959400	that's still here today,
1959400	1962020	and resulted in the deaths of children
1962020	1964780	from completely preventable diseases.
1964780	1966900	And that's the tea, sis.
1966900	1971040	There's real liquid in there. I'm not doing a bit.
1971040	1973040	I will spill it if I try and show it to you.
1973040	1976040	I'm sorry, but there's, look.
1976040	1977660	See? It's real.
1977660	1978880	It's not tea, though. It's coffee.
1978940	1979940	I'm not a farmer.
1982860	1984900	Perhaps the only thing more frustrating
1984900	1987240	than seeing the media do everything it can
1987240	1988820	to push pseudoscience
1988820	1992040	was how everyone actually addressed the topic of autism.
1992040	1994080	Autism is a complex condition
1994080	1996000	we still don't fully understand,
1996000	1999380	with many variations in symptoms and severity,
1999380	2001380	but the media never mentioned that.
2001380	2003760	They deliberately went looking for the most severe
2003760	2006220	and extreme cases they could find
2006220	2009060	and then filmed them to exploit for television.
2009060	2011360	Children who couldn't communicate verbally
2011360	2014020	or had severe physical disabilities as well.
2014020	2017100	The intent to make the MMR question
2017100	2018980	as serious as possible
2018980	2022200	resulted in an almost pornographic obsession
2022200	2023620	with suffering children.
2023620	2025700	They went out of their way to portray autism
2025700	2027700	as a horrific tragedy
2027700	2030120	that it's worth risking a disease to avoid.
2030120	2032920	And yeah, measles is a disease.
2032920	2034840	Like, it kills people.
2034880	2037200	It can cause incredibly severe complications
2037200	2038500	that are with people for life.
2038500	2040580	We as a society are no longer really aware
2040580	2042580	of just how dangerous measles can be
2042580	2045140	because we don't see all those complications
2045140	2047040	as much because of vaccinations.
2047040	2049600	Measles, mumps, and rubella are legitimately dangerous
2049600	2052480	and potentially life-threatening diseases,
2052480	2056440	and it says a lot about how we think about neurodivergence
2056440	2058740	that it's worth risking that
2058740	2060980	to avoid being autistic to some people.
2060980	2063020	Hell, I was in Waitrose a few months ago.
2063040	2065500	I never shop there, but I pretend to
2065500	2068500	so I can use their unnecessarily massive parking space,
2068500	2069920	and I saw them selling a magazine
2069920	2071500	with this on the cover.
2071500	2074260	Reignite your child's brain
2074260	2076840	with alternative treatments.
2076840	2079720	What they mean there is alternatives to treatment.
2079720	2082060	This is not how a healthy society
2082060	2083260	discusses its people.
2083260	2085060	Autistic people have to navigate a world
2085060	2087480	that refuses to accommodate them in the slightest
2087480	2089440	to the point they're regularly confronted
2089440	2092940	with the idea other people think their brain has gone out.
2092960	2095500	Come on, get it together, Waitrose.
2095500	2098000	You're the up-market, upper-class,
2098000	2099320	rich people supermarket.
2099320	2101700	You're supposed to be the smartest.
2101700	2103000	What's going on there?
2103000	2104580	The only thing that needs igniting here
2104580	2107180	is your fucking shops.
2107180	2110340	Did we get clearance to say that?
2110340	2111340	Okay, that was a joke?
2111340	2113140	While the MMR scale was at its height,
2113140	2116980	the entire media landscape was a unified front
2116980	2118720	in saying, wrongly,
2118720	2122320	that autism is the worst fate imaginable for a child
2122320	2125320	and much worse than dying of measles,
2125320	2128160	so a lot of kids didn't get vaccinated.
2128160	2130700	Then again, it wasn't all bad.
2130700	2132500	Some parents just vaccinated their children
2132500	2135320	for measles, mumps, and rubella separately,
2135320	2137920	which, by the way, was pretty expensive.
2137920	2140340	But they don't want their child to have MMR.
2140340	2142420	They'd rather pay for single vaccines
2142420	2144080	at 60 pounds a shot.
2144080	2145760	60 quid?
2145760	2147600	By jolly, governor!
2147600	2149680	Imagine millions of parents wanting
2149700	2152540	an expensive alternative vaccine
2152540	2154880	because all of a sudden a study had come out
2154880	2157640	saying that the regular one might cause autism
2157640	2160340	and a prominent scientist was cautioning against it.
2160340	2162560	He'd urged the government to split MMR
2162560	2164180	into separate vaccines.
2164180	2166100	Giving the measles on its own
2166100	2170060	reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing.
2170060	2172200	Why, whoever was producing and selling
2172200	2175360	the alternative vaccine would be in for a fucking goldmine,
2175360	2176320	wouldn't they?
2176320	2179660	They'd make an absolute fortune.
2179880	2181840	Here's a funny thing about that.
2181840	2182840	Part four.
2182840	2185220	Andrew Wakefield is a lying conman
2185220	2186360	who wanted your money.
2186360	2188680	Oh, sorry. That puts me at risk of libel, doesn't it?
2188680	2189900	Hold on. Let's revise that.
2189900	2191820	Part four.
2191820	2194940	In my opinion, Andrew Wakefield is a lying conman
2194940	2196020	who wanted your money.
2196020	2198120	So we have Wakefield's paper
2198120	2201740	and the implication that MMR might cause autism in there
2201740	2203240	and you have Wakefield saying,
2203240	2204860	I ain't got several vaccines.
2204860	2206660	You and I can both agree
2206660	2209280	that there might be a conflict of interest there
2209320	2213880	if, if Wakefield was selling an alternative vaccine, right?
2213880	2216880	We can all agree that would be fucked up, wouldn't it?
2220580	2223960	Here's Wakefield's patent on an alternative measles vaccine.
2223960	2226720	This little piece of shit was filed six months
2226720	2228220	before the study was released.
2228220	2232020	So, uh, what's going on there, Andy?
2232020	2235220	Something you want to tell us, buddy?
2235220	2238680	It's time to introduce someone new to the story.
2238720	2241680	Brian Deer is an award-winning investigative reporter
2241680	2243960	with a long history of exposing medical fraud,
2243960	2246060	specializing in the pharmaceutical industry,
2246060	2247440	and the perfect sort of person
2247440	2248980	for the middle of this health scare.
2248980	2250800	Deer was one of the few journalists
2250800	2252900	who didn't simply accept what Wakefield
2252900	2254440	was saying at face value
2254440	2256780	and thought to dig a little deeper into the study
2256780	2258360	and what he was really up to.
2258360	2260660	Deer called the hospital Wakefield worked at
2260660	2262360	with some basic questions,
2262360	2264080	the kind that Wakefield apparently
2264080	2265500	wasn't used to getting.
2265500	2267120	Within three hours of doing so,
2267140	2269180	Wakefield's publicist, you know,
2269180	2271520	doctors hiring publicists to promote them.
2271520	2272780	That happens all the time,
2272780	2274360	had made a complaint about Deer
2274360	2276020	to the newspaper he worked at.
2276020	2278520	Deer, of course, only grew more interested.
2278520	2280780	His eventual 2004 documentary,
2280780	2282400	MMR What They Didn't Tell You,
2282400	2284580	is the better documentary I mentioned before,
2284580	2287080	and by better, I mean blew the doors
2287080	2288960	off of Andrew Wakefield's whole scheme.
2288960	2291340	It was Deer who discovered Wakefield's patent.
2291340	2293260	Let's take a look at that patent now.
2293260	2295540	The present invention relates to a new vaccine
2296380	2298760	for the prevention and or prophylaxis
2298760	2301020	against measles virus infection.
2301020	2304640	Now, I'm not a big-time science-talking fancy guy,
2304640	2307480	but this sounds a little bit like a measles vaccine.
2307480	2310020	The patent was submitted in June 1997,
2310020	2312240	so Wakefield had done most of the study
2312240	2314020	and then rushed to patent a method
2314020	2316740	of making a competing vaccine he could sell later.
2316740	2319080	And guess what? If you look closely at the patent,
2319080	2322200	you can see a familiar name on there next to Wakefield's.
2322200	2324080	Remember Hugh Fudenberg?
2324160	2326500	The quack who thought he could cure autism
2326500	2328840	after having his medical license revoked?
2328840	2331500	His name is also on the patent!
2331500	2334720	He's credited as a co-inventor of this vaccine!
2334720	2336340	Fudenberg's company,
2336340	2339100	the very real and legitimate-sounding
2339100	2342520	Neuro-Immunotherapeutics Research Foundation,
2342520	2345220	is listed on the patent along with a business address.
2345220	2346860	In the documentary where he revealed
2346860	2348220	the existence of this patent,
2348220	2351360	Brian Deer went to that address to try to find Fudenberg
2351360	2353780	and discovered the company had already shut down
2353820	2355980	and the building had become a real estate agency.
2355980	2358860	Looking that address up now, it appears to be a hairdresser's.
2358860	2360320	Doesn't look like one of America's
2360320	2361900	premier research foundations.
2361900	2364160	When he did find him, Deer asked Fudenberg
2364160	2366860	about the whole thought-he-could-cure-autism thing
2366860	2369540	and, uh, well, I, uh, ha, ha, ha.
2369540	2372700	Do you believe that autism can be cured?
2372700	2374160	Yes.
2374160	2375460	Cured? Yes.
2375460	2378580	It's cheap, it's oral, no injections.
2378580	2382300	One pill a day, every other day for three or six months.
2382320	2383860	And where, where does that come from?
2383860	2385200	From my bone marrow.
2385200	2386200	From your own personal bone marrow?
2386200	2387400	Yeah.
2387400	2389200	I mean, that's, that seems extraordinary.
2389200	2390200	Yeah.
2390200	2392420	♪♪
2392420	2394960	Just to quickly remind you, this man is the co-inventor
2394960	2397120	of Wakefield's alternative vaccine.
2397120	2399040	You know what? You got me.
2399040	2400720	Vaccines might be dangerous.
2400720	2403460	And just in case it wasn't extremely obvious
2403460	2406680	what a hasty fucking scam Wackyfield
2406680	2408960	and his one friend who agreed with him
2408960	2411180	were putting together,
2411180	2414060	Fudenberg's name is spelled wrong on the patent.
2414060	2416280	The other inventor of this vaccine
2416280	2419620	besides Andrew Jeremy Wakefield
2419620	2424080	is one Hugh Fundenberg.
2424080	2426820	Nice one, Jeremy.
2426820	2429420	By 1999, Wakefield was the director
2429420	2430780	of several medical businesses,
2430780	2433160	Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Limited
2433160	2434920	and Carmel Healthcare Limited,
2434920	2436660	named after his wife at the time.
2436660	2437760	She later divorced him.
2437760	2439500	He started shopping these companies around
2439500	2441920	for investors based on the very convenient patent
2441920	2444700	he'd got right before the health scare he caused.
2444700	2446120	But in addition to the vaccine,
2446120	2448080	Wakefield had another product in mind.
2448080	2450720	If autistic enterocolitis turned out to be real,
2450720	2451920	big if there, I know,
2451920	2454420	that would mean there would be a completely new market
2454420	2456640	in the form of testing for this new disease.
2456640	2458880	Wakefield planned on producing and selling
2458880	2462440	diagnostic kits meant to test for autistic enterocolitis.
2462440	2464900	A private and confidential prospectus
2464900	2467860	for potential investors acquired by Brian Deer claimed,
2467900	2469720	It is estimated that the initial market
2469720	2472860	for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing
2472860	2476400	of patients with AE, autistic enterocolitis,
2476400	2478600	from both the UK and the USA.
2478600	2480520	Describing the target audiences as,
2480520	2481780	Parent groups and lawyers
2481780	2483700	representing affected individuals.
2483700	2484540	And,
2484540	2486040	Major pharmaceutical companies.
2486040	2487820	These prospectuses also calculated
2487820	2489540	how much these businesses would be worth.
2489540	2491840	It is estimated that by year three,
2491840	2493880	income from this testing could be about
2493880	2496280	£3,300,000,
2496280	2499740	rising to about £28 million.
2499740	2500860	Adjusting for inflation,
2500860	2504380	that upper estimate is about $72 million.
2504380	2505700	If you think that's bad,
2505700	2508160	years earlier he estimated a much larger number
2508160	2510760	to the for-profit branch of the Royal Free Medical School.
2510760	2514080	£72.5 million per year.
2514080	2517040	Almost $200 million in today's money.
2517040	2519840	In an inventor school investor meeting document
2519840	2520760	that Deer obtained,
2520760	2522640	Wakefield teased they could charge
2522640	2524640	premium prices for the technology
2524640	2525980	he intended to develop.
2525980	2528900	Wakefield also became director of a third business,
2528900	2531400	Unigenetics Limited, in the Irish Republic.
2531400	2533860	Wakefield applied for and was successfully given
2533860	2537700	£800,000, more than $2 million today,
2537700	2540380	in government funding to begin developing the test.
2540380	2542420	And this is all on top of how much money
2542420	2544800	Wakefield would get if he managed to get the funding
2544800	2546880	to manufacture his alternative vaccine.
2546880	2549220	Companies like Axcan Pharma in Canada
2549220	2552060	were paying to fly him out to discuss his business plans.
2552100	2553100	According to Brian Deer,
2553100	2555220	he was also negotiating a consultancy
2555220	2557680	with Johnson & Johnson and developing connections
2557680	2560060	with both Merck and SmithKlineBeachum.
2560060	2563060	This guy was sure he was gonna be rolling in money.
2563060	2566720	I wonder if this might point to a financial incentive
2566720	2568360	to discredit MMR.
2568360	2572860	Hmmmmm...
2572860	2573360	Ah!
2573440	2575380	Watching Wakefield repeatedly push
2575380	2578440	for getting alternative vaccines just in case
2578440	2580400	is really chilling to watch now.
2580400	2583280	You have to watch him sit there and create demand
2583280	2585400	for his planned future products,
2585400	2587620	and no one watching knows what he's up to.
2587620	2591120	They think he's a doctor just asking questions about MMR.
2591120	2592960	No wonder he wasn't anti-vaccine.
2592960	2594660	He wanted you to buy his!
2594660	2596840	That said, there were a few roadblocks
2596840	2598500	to the success of these businesses.
2598500	2600720	The first is that autistic enterocolitis
2600720	2602880	is a fake disease he just made up,
2602880	2605800	which means it's very hard to invent a test for it.
2605800	2607380	In Ireland, at Unigenetics,
2607380	2608880	Wakefield brought in a colleague,
2608920	2611700	John O'Leary, to try to get the testing kits to work.
2611700	2614880	O'Leary claimed his test could find measles virus
2614880	2617080	in the bowels of autistic children.
2617080	2619680	He'd found measles virus in most of the samples
2619680	2622760	he'd tested from children with autism and bowel disease.
2622760	2625460	This is the closest Wakefield or any of his cohorts
2625460	2628920	would ever come to proving autistic enterocolitis exists,
2628920	2630680	but this quickly fell apart.
2630680	2633480	Every other lab that tried to recreate his results
2633480	2634640	found the same thing.
2634640	2636680	The only way his equipment could get the results
2636700	2638860	he was getting is if there was contamination
2638860	2641000	or if his machine had been calibrated wrong.
2641000	2642820	It turned out later it was both.
2642820	2645280	Test tubes that didn't have measles in them
2645280	2647080	tested positive for measles.
2647080	2650460	O'Leary had an 11.1% stake in Immunospecifics,
2650460	2652420	the company which would be selling the kits,
2652420	2654220	which would have made him incredibly rich
2654220	2655920	if the test had eventually worked,
2655920	2658640	but strangely he stopped being able to get these results
2658640	2660920	once people started scrutinizing his work.
2660920	2663880	So that's 800,000 pounds of taxpayer money
2663880	2664880	down the drain.
2664880	2667260	♪ ♪
2667260	2669380	The second problem was that potential investors
2669380	2671220	who looked into his alternative vaccine
2671220	2674560	even slightly would notice that the guy who co-invented it
2674560	2676640	was a doctor who had just been fired
2676640	2678060	and thought he could cure autism
2678060	2679760	using his fucking bone marrow!
2679760	2682280	So I guess what I'm saying is there was a slight delay
2682280	2684240	in finding people willing to fund it.
2684240	2687240	Finally, as Wakefield tried to launch his businesses,
2687240	2688620	there was a critical shake-up
2688620	2690280	at the hospital he was working at.
2690280	2692660	While many of the Royal Free Hospital's higher-ups
2692660	2695160	were fans of Wakefield's controversial paper
2695160	2696860	and the attention it brought to the hospital
2696860	2698280	and medical school, and some of them
2698280	2701000	were even involved directly with his new businesses,
2701000	2704660	in late 1999 the school got a new head of medicine
2704660	2706000	named Mark Pepys.
2706000	2708880	Pepys was a specialist in fields close to what Wakefield
2708880	2710720	was speculating about in his papers,
2710720	2712760	and like most scientists who knew anything
2712760	2715380	about the subject could tell something was up.
2715380	2717600	Wakefield was sent a letter voicing concerns
2717600	2719920	about the scientifically unjustified basis
2719920	2721480	of the work the companies were doing
2721500	2723340	along with the incredibly obvious
2723340	2725380	conflicts of interest happening here.
2725380	2727100	You know, you kind of have a vested interest
2727100	2728760	in proving a link between vaccines,
2728760	2730140	bowel disorders, and autism
2730140	2732940	when you intend to make millions of pounds off it.
2732940	2735900	Even then, they volunteered to support Wakefield more,
2735900	2737400	but not in the way he wanted.
2737400	2739400	Remember that thing I said about pilot studies?
2739400	2740940	I'm sure you do. You have a good memory.
2740940	2742120	I really respect that about you.
2742120	2743860	They offered to continue employing him,
2743860	2747120	but only if he undertook a new, much bigger study
2747120	2750160	to actually explore the original study's findings properly.
2750180	2753220	He was offered help with a study on 150 patients
2753220	2755720	to confirm what he had only really speculated about
2755720	2757600	so far with a study of 12.
2757600	2760780	Good scientific practice now demands that you and others
2760780	2763660	seek to confirm or refute robustly, reliably,
2763660	2765440	and above all, reproducibly,
2765440	2767320	the possible causal relationships
2767320	2770200	between MMR vaccination and autism,
2770200	2774460	autistic enterocolitis, and inflammatory bowel disease
2774460	2776820	that you have postulated.
2776820	2779240	Autistic enterocolitis is in quotes.
2779240	2780700	They don't believe him. It's great.
2780700	2783660	This would be any legitimate scientist's dream.
2783660	2787300	The freedom and support to fully explore a hypothesis
2787300	2788680	and discover the truth.
2788680	2790960	Wakefield agreed to perform the study,
2790960	2792840	but then he never actually did it.
2792840	2795420	Pepys would later go on to say Wakefield was
2795420	2797260	a wanker and a fraud.
2797260	2800940	Eventually, in 2001, after repeatedly ignoring calls
2800940	2802980	to do the study he'd agreed to do,
2802980	2804260	he was told to leave.
2804260	2805980	Check out this article all about...
2805980	2807480	Oh, I love journalism.
2807480	2809760	Last November, Andrew Wakefield
2809760	2813020	left the Royal Free Hospital by mutual agreement.
2813020	2815640	Capitalizing on his perceived reputation with the public
2815640	2817320	as a man who had discovered a link
2817320	2819560	between vaccines and autism, Wakefield said...
2819560	2821060	I have been asked to go
2821060	2823820	because my research results are unpopular.
2823820	2825780	This was meant to sound conspiratorial,
2825780	2828360	like, they let me go because I'm making MMR look bad,
2828360	2830820	but it seems like he was just unpopular with people
2830820	2833660	because they could tell he was a fraud and a wanker.
2833660	2835200	At this point, Wakefield's career
2835200	2837380	as far as real medicine was concerned
2837400	2839980	was over and his businesses failed to get off the ground
2839980	2842320	because he no longer had any legitimacy left.
2842320	2844820	What pharmaceutical company or other investor
2844820	2847580	is gonna give money to a doctor who just got fired
2847580	2849700	for refusing to prove the thing he's trying
2849700	2851960	to get funding for even exists?
2851960	2854920	In 2003, Deer's investigation was in a full swing
2854920	2856700	and beginning to uncover all of this.
2856700	2858800	He also made a really interesting discovery
2858800	2861500	about something that took place during the original study.
2861500	2863960	You know that whole autistic enterocolitis thing?
2863960	2866100	Both his theories about MMR's danger
2866100	2868320	and his new businesses making testing kits
2868320	2870660	for the disease rested on being able to find
2870660	2872620	the measles virus in the intestines
2872620	2873780	of children with autism.
2873780	2875000	The question we've been asking,
2875000	2877780	is measles virus present
2877780	2879920	in the intestine of these children?
2879920	2883080	The BBC documentary covered this search extensively
2883080	2884760	with Wakefield saying in an interview
2884760	2886620	that proving it was there would require
2886620	2889640	finding the RNA of the virus in tissue samples.
2889640	2892180	The gold standard now is to find
2892180	2893800	the gene of the virus in there.
2893800	2896060	The big deal here is if Wakefield can't find
2896060	2898560	the gene of the virus, then his theory is wrong.
2898560	2900980	In these interviews, Wakefield is trying to imply
2900980	2903140	that they've only just started looking for the virus,
2903140	2905100	so they haven't found it yet, but that's okay.
2905100	2907660	They've only just started looking, right?
2907660	2909660	This turned out to be a lie.
2909660	2912860	Deer discovered that Wakefield had already looked for it
2912860	2914000	and it's not there.
2914000	2916780	Dr. Nick Chadwick worked on Wakefield's paper
2916780	2918580	and was a specialist on methods
2918580	2921420	of finding measles RNA in tissue samples.
2921420	2924120	Wakefield actually helped co-author some of his work,
2924140	2926700	so of course, Wakefield had Chadwick look
2926700	2928980	for measles RNA in the tissue samples
2928980	2930700	taken from the children in the study.
2930700	2932540	These were the children Wakefield was sure
2932540	2934660	must have measles somewhere in their guts
2934660	2936700	since he was blaming their autism on it.
2936700	2938540	However, when he looked,
2938540	2941160	he never found any measles whatsoever.
2941160	2944460	Did you find measles virus in those children?
2944460	2947000	No.
2947000	2949800	No single case did I find any measles virus
2949800	2950800	in those children.
2950800	2953220	This means that Wakefield already knew
2953280	2955280	before he even published the paper
2955280	2957040	that measles couldn't be found
2957040	2958780	in the guts of autistic children.
2958780	2961460	Dr. Wakefield's theory was that it was measles virus itself
2961460	2963380	that was responsible for a bowel disease
2963380	2966720	and then leading on to some kinds of autism
2966720	2968260	and you found no measles virus.
2968260	2969260	That's correct.
2969260	2971800	The final published version of the 1998 study
2971800	2973840	doesn't have Dr. Chadwick's name on it
2973840	2975600	even though he did a lot of work for it.
2975600	2977940	Chadwick later wrote in a signed declaration
2977940	2979600	that he specifically asked for his name
2979600	2980900	to be left off the paper
2980900	2982780	because he wasn't comfortable with how Wakefield
2982840	2984380	was still pushing his theory
2984380	2987580	even though he'd found zero positive tests for measles.
2987580	2989880	By this point, he was already planning
2989880	2992140	to launch a business selling testing kits
2992140	2993180	based on this theory,
2993180	2995640	so he ignored the work in his own lab
2995640	2997560	that disproved him and kept saying
2997560	2999600	he thought measles could cause a bowel disease
2999600	3000600	that leads to autism
3000600	3002260	and kept looking there for measles
3002260	3003680	for years afterwards.
3003680	3006100	The BBC documentary is about his hunt
3006100	3007240	for the measles virus
3007240	3009980	because even four years after launching his paper,
3009980	3011860	he still hadn't found anything else
3011860	3013320	to back up what he was saying.
3013320	3014740	I actually have to give some credit now
3014740	3016080	to this BBC documentary.
3016080	3017900	Even though they mostly side with Wakefield
3017900	3020320	and assume he's going to find the proof soon,
3020320	3022200	there is one segment where the interviewer's like,
3022200	3023200	wait a second.
3023200	3025040	Shouldn't you have proved it
3025040	3026920	before you said it?
3026920	3030160	As I say, proof may be 10, 15 years away
3030160	3032660	in terms of definitive scientific proof.
3032660	3033760	So shouldn't you have waited?
3033760	3034760	No.
3034760	3036300	Obviously after discovering all this,
3036300	3039180	Brian Deer had even more questions for Wakefield,
3039180	3041380	which Wakefield was continuing to avoid.
3041580	3044580	I've been trying now to speak with him for a year.
3044580	3046160	We even wrote,
3046160	3047960	but he didn't reply.
3047960	3050300	Deer eventually just went to an autism conference
3050300	3051540	Wakefield was speaking at.
3051540	3052920	After his presentation,
3052920	3054800	Deer approached him with questions.
3054800	3056460	Dr. Wakefield, I'm sorry to interrupt.
3056460	3058040	Brian Deer, Channel 4 Television.
3058040	3060180	Um, could I talk to you about your research, sir,
3060180	3061680	and your, uh, commercial ambitions?
3061680	3062680	Excuse me.
3062680	3064300	There's something kind of cathartic
3064300	3066760	about just how guilty Wakefield acts here.
3066760	3069440	Like, he's happily hanging around after his talk,
3069460	3072300	casually answering questions from concerned parents
3072300	3073420	and other reporters,
3073420	3076340	and then the instant he recognizes Brian Deer,
3076340	3079300	the guy he's been actively avoiding for over a year,
3079300	3082100	he turns and leaves the room as fast as he can.
3082100	3083600	Wakefield's only defense
3083600	3085680	against his clear financial incentive
3085680	3087900	to discredit MMR is to run away
3087900	3089360	and hope you leave him alone,
3089360	3092060	and since Deer clearly wasn't doing that,
3092060	3093940	Wakefield decided to escalate.
3093940	3095520	A few months after this footage
3095520	3098120	of him heroically running away like a baby
3098120	3099960	from basic inquiry was broadcast,
3099960	3102120	Wacky Andy filed a defamation lawsuit
3102120	3104420	against Channel 4, who produced the documentary,
3104420	3106880	the Sunday Times, who published some of Deer's reporting,
3106880	3111420	and additionally, he sued Brian Deer's personal website,
3111420	3113180	briandeer.com.
3113180	3115720	Can you imagine being that petty?
3115720	3119480	In 2004, 10 of the paper's original 13 authors
3119480	3121680	came forward to publicly retract
3121680	3123760	the interpretation section of the paper.
3123760	3125940	Half a decade after its publication,
3125940	3127480	a vast majority of the people
3127500	3130340	who worked with Wakefield on his paper
3130340	3131800	have gone on record to say
3131800	3133840	they think his conclusions are bollocks.
3133840	3136400	At this point, Wakefield's study's coffin
3136400	3138140	has fallen through the floor
3138140	3140060	from the sheer weight of all the nails
3140060	3141280	that have been hammered in it.
3141280	3144560	So that's the foundational study
3144560	3146660	of the anti-vaccine movement.
3146660	3149200	A hack fraud's bullshit paper
3149200	3150660	claiming that a handful of parents
3150660	3152620	know better than all doctors
3152620	3156280	so he could sell an alternative competing vaccine
3156300	3157880	that he'd patented,
3157880	3162340	which he thought he was gonna make millions selling.
3162340	3164340	The evidence against the movement
3164340	3167180	can't get much worse than that, can it?
3169720	3170860	That was a joke.
3170860	3172780	Part five, it gets much worse.
3172780	3174280	Brian Deer didn't stop there.
3174280	3177060	Wakefield was trying to sue him to get him to stop digging,
3177060	3177980	and guess what?
3177980	3180480	One of the first rules of investigative reporting
3180480	3183200	is that if they try and sue you for finding things out,
3183200	3184940	you're probably onto something.
3184940	3186560	I mean, he brought me into the story
3186560	3189560	by virtue of the fact that years ago he sued me.
3189560	3191940	He discovered that two years before the paper
3191940	3194360	was published, Wakefield had been hired
3194360	3196700	by a lawyer to conduct the study.
3196700	3198160	The lawyer, Richard Barr,
3198160	3200360	had realized there was potentially millions
3200360	3202320	and millions of pounds in bringing
3202320	3205200	a class-action lawsuit against MMR manufacturers
3205200	3207320	on behalf of parents of autistic children,
3207320	3209200	but since there was no actual evidence
3209200	3210460	the vaccine did this,
3210460	3212960	he paid Wakefield to find some.
3212980	3216100	Wakefield charged Barr £150 an hour
3216100	3217980	for the time he spent working on the study,
3217980	3222280	eventually totaling over £435,000.
3222280	3225740	In today's money, that's more than $1.1 million.
3225740	3228540	This was more than eight times his yearly salary
3228540	3230080	at his job at the hospital.
3230080	3232280	Six months before the Lancet published the study,
3232280	3235200	Barr sent Wakefield a letter saying, and I quote,
3235200	3236460	actually, I got Sean to say it.
3236460	3238040	I have mentioned to you before
3238040	3239920	that the prime objective is to produce
3239920	3241880	unassailable evidence in court
3241880	3243480	so as to convince a court
3243480	3245940	that these vaccines are dangerous.
3245940	3247060	Oh, okay.
3247060	3249020	This whole thing was bullshit, wasn't it?
3249020	3250900	And hey, remember Jabs?
3250900	3252940	Jabs was involved with the lawsuit,
3252940	3255400	and it turned out their members helped to recruit
3255400	3258060	many of the parents to the study in the first place.
3258060	3260580	I swear to God, this isn't one of the joke logos we made.
3260580	3262740	This is actually the header on their Facebook page.
3262740	3265120	This low-resolution, shitty nightmare.
3265120	3267360	Jackie Fletcher, the founder of Jabs,
3267360	3269620	was also a litigant in the lawsuit.
3269620	3272620	They needed her connections to the dozen or so other parents
3272620	3275540	who actually blamed MMR to be able to do all of this.
3275540	3277240	Some of the parents were even involved
3277240	3278340	with the lawsuit too.
3278340	3280040	It's kind of clever if you think about it.
3280040	3281760	A couple of parents blamed vaccines
3281760	3284340	for their child's autism and wanted to sue its manufacturer,
3284340	3286920	but there was no evidence it wasn't just a coincidence,
3286920	3289100	so they told their opinions to a doctor
3289100	3291260	their lawyer had hired who would then report
3291260	3292800	those opinions in a paper,
3292800	3296180	and now in court you can say there's scientific evidence
3296180	3298520	implying a link between vaccines and autism
3298540	3301220	even though the link is just those opinions from before.
3301220	3303340	There's probably a word for this trick.
3303340	3305260	Idea laundering? I don't know.
3305260	3307600	Not all of the parents knew the study was being done
3307600	3308600	to help a lawsuit,
3308600	3310600	but they were all chosen deliberately.
3310600	3312260	However, like we explored earlier,
3312260	3316060	not many parents in 1996 blamed vaccines for autism,
3316060	3318520	so they had to cast a wide net to even find
3318520	3320200	the couple of parents they did.
3320200	3322520	Child 11 wasn't even from England.
3322520	3323940	He was from California.
3323940	3326360	If a contact of Jabs or Richard Barr
3326360	3328540	thought you might suspect vaccines
3328540	3329920	made your child autistic,
3329920	3332920	you and your child were being flown around the world
3332920	3334540	to take part in this study,
3334540	3337300	and even then some of the parents still turned out
3337300	3338960	not to blame the vaccine.
3338960	3341500	I cannot stress enough what a fucking shambles
3341500	3342500	this paper was.
3342500	3344380	Most of the other doctors working on the study
3344380	3347220	had no idea the guy running it had been paid
3347220	3349980	hundreds of thousands of pounds to discredit MMR.
3349980	3351820	According to Chadwick's later testimony,
3351820	3354780	Wakefield worked separately with each individual scientist
3355740	3357440	instead of bringing them all together,
3357440	3359400	which would have been the normal thing to do.
3359400	3361700	This afforded Wakefield a good level of secrecy
3361700	3362700	about his motives.
3362700	3364620	The other scientists must have largely thought
3364620	3366460	they really were looking into a connection
3366460	3368780	between autism and bowel disorders in children,
3368780	3371500	so even the doctors and scientists involved
3371500	3373500	were being lied to and tricked
3373500	3375420	into lending their time and effort
3375420	3377580	to a study being done to help a lawsuit
3377580	3379500	make some lawyers a lot of money.
3379500	3381220	Once all of this came out,
3381220	3384300	Wakefield was, medically speaking, fucked.
3384320	3386900	While he'd been asked to leave his post years earlier,
3386900	3390040	he still had a license to practice medicine in the UK,
3390040	3391960	but amidst all of these discoveries,
3391960	3394740	the General Medical Council began a fitness-to-practice
3394740	3396080	hearing against Wakefield,
3396080	3397760	going through the records of the study
3397760	3400180	to evaluate whether his behavior had been ethical.
3400180	3403000	The row he started dominated the headlines.
3403000	3405420	Now his conduct, not his views,
3405420	3406880	will be making the news.
3406880	3410180	This hearing would go on to last for 217 days,
3410180	3412840	making it the longest in General Medical Council history
3412840	3415220	and longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.
3415220	3417640	This is Wakefield's only legitimate achievement.
3417640	3419480	He made such a fucking mess,
3419480	3421900	it took that long to pick through it all.
3421900	3424820	Meanwhile, remember when Wakefield sued Brian Deer?
3424820	3426700	This would turn out to be the worst mistake
3426700	3428160	he ever made in his life.
3428160	3430360	Because Wakefield's libel case
3430360	3433400	was related to accusations of what he did during a study,
3433400	3436320	that meant that the records of what happened in the study
3436320	3438320	were evidence in the case now.
3438320	3441120	I mean, how else were they gonna prove it was libel or not?
3441120	3443860	The judge agreed that Deer had to be granted access
3443860	3446660	to the confidential, unredacted medical records
3446660	3448080	of the children from the study.
3448080	3450740	By trying to sue a journalist into shutting up,
3450740	3453580	Wakefield had accidentally given him permission
3453580	3455300	to see everything.
3455300	3457920	Deer recalls being sat in a room with his lawyer,
3457920	3459800	reading the medical records of the children
3459800	3461800	and other records of what happened in the study
3461800	3463800	while Wakefield's legal team were rushing
3463800	3466340	to get a cab to take them to the courthouse
3466340	3468520	so they could drop the suit and stop him reading it
3468520	3469760	as fast as they could.
3470740	3473000	Deer got home that night to a call from his lawyer
3473000	3475620	saying the case—new firmware available?
3475620	3476620	Thanks, Windows!
3476620	3478700	Deer got home that night to a call from his lawyer
3478700	3480200	telling him the case was over,
3480200	3481380	and as a fun bonus,
3481380	3483260	because of how lawsuits work in the UK,
3483260	3485580	Wakefield had to pay Deer's legal costs,
3485580	3487880	the check for which Deer keeps proudly displayed
3487880	3490640	on his website, but Deer wasn't done yet.
3490640	3492920	Wakefield had just dropped a lawsuit
3492920	3494840	to stop him finding things out.
3494840	3496840	But in the context of that lawsuit,
3496840	3499060	a great deal of information was disclosed to me
3499060	3500400	by Wakefield's lawyers,
3500400	3502060	and it was quite clear I had to continue.
3502060	3504320	Deer continued his research and also attended
3504320	3506940	many of the GMC's hearings about Wakefield's conduct
3506940	3509040	which discussed many of the same records
3509040	3511320	he just dropped a lawsuit to hide,
3511320	3513840	and based on all of this, he put the pieces together
3513840	3516620	and figured out exactly what happened during the study.
3516620	3519420	The result of his work is an absolutely incredible series
3519420	3522220	of articles first published in the British Medical Journal.
3522220	3523420	♪♪
3523420	3525000	There's another fucking firmware!
3525000	3526680	Why is there so much firmware?
3526680	3528800	Deer figured out who some of the previously
3528800	3531340	anonymous parents of the children in the study were
3531340	3533340	and showed some of them what the study said
3533340	3535420	about their children, and it turned out
3535420	3536760	the paper was lying.
3536760	3538760	For example, he showed the medical records
3538760	3540340	to the father of child 11.
3540340	3542600	And he looked at the paper, and he just looked
3542600	3544560	at what it said about his own child,
3544560	3547600	and he said, that's not true.
3547600	3550320	And that was, uh, one of the parents
3550320	3551780	of one of these children in the paper.
3551780	3554520	In a correspondence with Deer, he literally wrote...
3554520	3556820	The Lancet article indicates that autistic symptoms
3556820	3559860	started 15 months, a week after the MMR,
3559860	3562100	which is completely inaccurate.
3562100	3565360	My son's autistic behavior started 2 1⁄2 to 3 months
3565360	3568700	after the MMR, which was administered to him
3568700	3570120	at 15 months.
3570120	3574000	The bottom line is, if my son is indeed patient 11,
3574000	3576120	then the Lancet article made a false assertion
3576120	3579200	that his symptoms set in immediately after the MMR,
3579200	3583300	in service of some attorney's efforts to prove causation
3583320	3587240	that, unbeknownst to me, apparently drove this research.
3587240	3589460	He told Deer Wakefield had said his son
3589460	3591500	was the 13th child they'd looked at
3591500	3593120	and wasn't included in the paper,
3593120	3595200	and that's why none of the information in the study
3595200	3597000	seemed to describe his son.
3597000	3599720	According to Brian Deer, Wakefield had rewritten
3599720	3603600	his son's medical history and lied to him to cover it up.
3603600	3605760	And this wasn't the only parent who had their story
3605760	3606980	changed by Wakefield.
3606980	3609680	You see, for the study to be useful in Barr's lawsuit,
3609680	3612480	they needed to establish a temporal link
3612480	3613480	with the vaccine.
3613480	3615860	Since this is the age autism usually develops,
3615860	3618020	they needed it to be within 14 days
3618020	3619620	and, if possible, even closer.
3619620	3621660	I mean, otherwise, it might seem like it was just
3621660	3625280	a coincidence, which it is, but like child 11,
3625280	3627660	the onset of autism wasn't convenient enough
3627660	3629300	in almost any of the other children.
3629300	3632380	The table suggests that eight of the 12 children's parents
3632380	3635180	claimed the symptoms happened within 14 days,
3635180	3636960	but according to Brian Deer's reporting
3636960	3638340	from the medical council hearings,
3638340	3640460	many of the parents never said this,
3640460	3642300	and most of the children's medical records
3642300	3645300	put their symptoms starting way after this time period
3645300	3646960	with some of them showing symptoms
3646960	3650600	of what could have been autism before they were vaccinated.
3650600	3652940	Almost every child's autistic symptoms
3652940	3655940	either started way too late to be useful in the lawsuit
3655940	3657520	or way too soon.
3657520	3660240	Wakefield just lied and changed the times
3660240	3662020	and allegations of the parents around
3662020	3664520	until the paper said what he needed it to say.
3664520	3666900	This is the thing that makes so much of what he said
3666920	3669300	during the scare really fucking infuriating.
3669300	3670800	Like, he would constantly bring up
3670800	3672680	how he was just listening to the parents
3672680	3674760	and reporting what they were saying.
3674760	3676480	We believe.
3676480	3678600	We trust in the parents' story.
3678600	3681480	If you think there was a problem with my shitty study,
3681480	3683900	you're calling all of those parents liars.
3683900	3685100	How dare you?
3685100	3686240	When they say to you,
3686240	3688700	I believe my child regressed after the MMR vaccine,
3688700	3690400	do you take that seriously or not?
3690400	3691700	Damn right you do.
3691700	3692860	Damn right you do.
3692860	3694740	He got all high and mighty about how you need
3694760	3697260	to believe the parents when he had made up
3697260	3699140	most of what the parents had said
3699140	3701260	and the media fucking ate it up too.
3701260	3703480	Andrew Wakefield is one of the few doctors
3703480	3706060	to listen to parents who believe their children
3706060	3707940	were damaged by MMR.
3707940	3710780	He's the only doctor who listens to the lies
3710780	3715820	that he wrote for a lawsuit he was being paid to help with.
3715820	3716900	Fucking hell.
3716900	3719580	Remember that new syndrome Wakefield came up with?
3719580	3721400	Now we know why he did that.
3721400	3723040	To pursue a class action lawsuit
3723040	3724820	against the vaccine's manufacturers
3724820	3727120	and convince a court of the vaccine's danger,
3727120	3729660	to quote a judge, Barr needed it to cause
3729660	3732660	a distinct and specific clinical syndrome.
3732660	3735240	If all the kids just had random bowel disorders,
3735240	3737620	there wouldn't be a clear enough link to the vaccine,
3737620	3740320	but if they all had a fancy new disease,
3740320	3742860	he could argue they were all caused by the same thing.
3742860	3745620	Wakefield invented autistic enterocolitis,
3745620	3748580	which he repeatedly called a genuinely new syndrome
3748580	3751580	in the media so the lawsuit could justify itself.
3751620	3752860	Of course, to do this,
3752860	3754400	all the children's bowel disorders
3754400	3756280	would have to actually look similar enough
3756280	3758540	that they could reasonably be called the same thing.
3758540	3760740	The paper listed 11 of the 12 children
3760740	3763120	having some form of nonspecific colitis,
3763120	3765780	creating the illusion that they all had a similar disorder.
3765780	3768080	According to the actual medical records,
3768080	3771440	only three of them had any major inflammation whatsoever.
3771440	3773280	The study had a pathologist on board
3773280	3775900	to determine what sort of bowel diseases the children had.
3775900	3778160	When she and her team ruled out colitis
3778160	3779440	in over half of the children,
3779440	3781400	which would obviously have been bad for the lawsuit,
3781420	3783640	Wakefield brought in a second pathologist
3783640	3786140	who had worked with him before to run the tests again.
3786140	3788600	When the second pathologist didn't even make mention
3788600	3790220	of colitis in his reports,
3790220	3792980	Wakefield ignored both of them and just wrote in the paper
3792980	3796640	that 11 of the 12 children had similar nonspecific colitis.
3796640	3799280	Wakefield went over the heads of everyone on his team
3799280	3802820	who didn't find any colitis and decided by himself
3802820	3805980	that all the children had a special new gut disorder
3805980	3808600	that causes autism.
3808600	3809600	What the fuck?
3809600	3810760	But that's not all.
3810760	3812880	You know how most of the children in the study
3812880	3814840	were diagnosed with a form of autism
3814840	3816620	and how, like, that's the entire point
3816620	3817920	that most of them had autism?
3817920	3820000	Like, that's the whole thing?
3820000	3822800	Well, it turns out that some of the children
3822800	3825420	reported as autistic in the study
3825420	3828040	didn't even have autism.
3828040	3830580	♪♪
3830580	3833620	Child seven was never diagnosed with autism
3833620	3836380	before, during, or after this study.
3836380	3839500	He was referred to the study because child six,
3839500	3842120	his brother, was diagnosed with autism.
3842120	3845420	Wakefield reported that this child was also autistic
3845420	3847240	and started showing signs of autism
3847240	3849580	24 hours after being vaccinated.
3849580	3852460	I mean, why not if you're just making shit up, right?
3852460	3856000	Child 12 had also never been given an autism diagnosis.
3856000	3858380	The developmental specialist who diagnosed them
3858380	3861380	said they had an impairment in respective language
3861380	3863920	but did not diagnose them with autism.
3863920	3865580	Wakefield, who, just to remind you,
3865580	3868380	is a gut surgeon with no psychiatric expertise
3868380	3870620	whatsoever, decided this was enough for him
3870620	3872260	to say they were autistic
3872260	3874760	and since their parents didn't blame the vaccine,
3874760	3876720	he said loss of speech development
3876720	3878420	and deterioration in language skills
3878420	3881140	noted at 16 months and made sure to mention
3881140	3883300	the child had MMR at 15 months
3883300	3886040	just so you know it started soon after the vaccine
3886040	3888300	even though the parents didn't blame it.
3888300	3890140	Oh, and while he was there, he diagnosed them
3890140	3892380	with chronic nonspecific colitis too.
3892380	3894680	You can see why Wakefield dropped his lawsuit
3894680	3897000	as fast as he could when Deer got permission
3897000	3898080	to read these, right?
3898080	3899500	This is likely why he never did
3899500	3901540	the larger study when he was asked to.
3901540	3903540	Once this fraudulent paper was out,
3903540	3905920	all the extra attention and scrutiny he gained
3905920	3907620	would have made it impossible to lie
3907620	3908960	and get away with it again.
3908960	3911160	To this day, no attempt to recreate
3911160	3913380	Wakefield's findings has ever succeeded.
3913380	3915040	The paper that started the obsession
3915040	3917260	with the connection between autism and vaccines
3917260	3919880	was a total fraud crafted by a lawyer
3919880	3922500	and the opportunistic doctor who he bought
3922500	3923920	and in the last 20 years,
3923920	3926420	data from millions and millions of children
3926420	3929840	all over the world indicates no link whatsoever.
3929840	3932600	The only paper that came close to showing that link
3932600	3935960	is a study so full of lies that even before it was out,
3935960	3938000	scientists who worked on it were asking
3938000	3939800	to have their names taken off.
3939800	3941720	The paper wasn't just badly made.
3941720	3943260	It wasn't just questionable.
3943260	3945500	It wasn't bold and controversial.
3945500	3947640	It was a lie for money,
3947640	3950100	but the worst thing about this study
3950100	3954600	was that somehow even that wasn't the worst thing.
3955580	3958580	["Wakefield"]
3958580	3961580	["Wakefield"]
3961580	3963960	["Wakefield"]
3963960	3965380	Hey, folks, the next section deals
3965380	3966800	with some pretty heavy stuff,
3966800	3969080	so if you're not into stories of child abuse,
3969080	3970500	uh, skip to the next chapter.
3970500	3973500	["Wakefield"]
3973500	3975000	As we've already explored,
3975000	3977800	Wakefield was trying to discover a new disease
3977800	3979760	linking autism and bowel disorders,
3979760	3982300	so during the study, he did everything he could
3982300	3983760	to find that link.
3983840	3985880	For this reason, each child underwent
3985880	3988300	a rough battery of invasive procedures.
3988300	3990840	The children spent a full week at the hospital,
3990840	3992880	during which they were frequently sedated,
3992880	3995220	given laxatives, had blood samples taken,
3995220	3996960	and then they were given colonoscopies,
3996960	3999000	lumbar punctures where a needle is inserted
3999000	4001380	between the bones of your spine to extract fluid,
4001380	4003560	MRI scans, again under sedation,
4003560	4006300	electroencephalograms where wires and electrodes
4006300	4007720	are run to the patient's head,
4007720	4010100	and a variety of other uncomfortable procedures.
4010100	4012340	A doctor once described this list of tests
4012340	4014380	as a lot even for adults to go through,
4014380	4016640	never mind autistic children.
4016640	4018140	Now, there's this thing in medicine
4018140	4020060	called informed consent.
4020060	4023100	Doctors can't just do invasive procedures on people.
4023100	4024720	You have to inform the patient
4024720	4026440	of the potential risks and dangers,
4026440	4028680	and you can only move forward with their approval.
4028680	4030820	In this study, the children were very young,
4030820	4033860	and some of them, emphasis on some, were autistic.
4033860	4035320	This meant the children's parents
4035320	4037160	had to give informed consent for them.
4037160	4039400	Andrew Wakefield wrote a handout to parents
4039400	4040700	to go with the consent form,
4040700	4043280	describing the procedures and their potential risks.
4043280	4045440	SurCare, a human rights organization,
4045440	4047400	acquired a copy of this handout,
4047400	4049360	and while the form does mention
4049360	4052240	almost every procedure Wakefield intended to do,
4052240	4055820	it doesn't mention any of the risks associated with them.
4055820	4056920	I'm serious.
4056920	4059660	The word risk is literally
4059660	4062300	not written anywhere on the form.
4062300	4065540	So let's talk about the risks of some of these procedures.
4065540	4066720	For those of you who don't know,
4066720	4068640	a colonoscopy is when a large tube
4068660	4071340	with a camera in it is inserted through your rectum
4071340	4073040	all the way up into your guts.
4073040	4074460	Normally, this is an important
4074460	4076300	and safe diagnostic procedure.
4076300	4079460	It's the most accurate test for rectal and colon cancer,
4079460	4081040	and this saves a lot of lives.
4081040	4083000	Sorry, I'm gonna take a moment and turn this video
4083000	4085720	into a public service announcement for colonoscopies.
4085720	4087720	Um, get one.
4087720	4089060	I'm being serious.
4089060	4091860	If you're an adult, especially over the age of 45,
4091860	4093480	and you've never had a colonoscopy,
4093480	4095440	please seriously consider getting one.
4095440	4097640	I've lost an uncle and a close friend
4097660	4100740	to bowel cancer at shockingly young ages.
4100740	4102400	It's a really common cause of death,
4102400	4104320	and if they catch it early, it's treatable.
4104320	4106080	Colonoscopies are perfectly safe
4106080	4108080	and often life-saving procedures,
4108080	4110280	but in children whose intestines are smaller
4110280	4112280	and weaker and harder to maneuver in,
4112280	4114620	there are risks of serious complications.
4114620	4116420	The scope can puncture the intestine,
4116420	4118760	which causes bacteria from the gut to leak out
4118760	4121720	and cause infection and other serious internal damage.
4121720	4124220	Risks of complications are significantly higher
4124220	4126140	for children five years or younger.
4126140	4129440	We try to be very careful to come around corners.
4129440	4131100	And these risks are genuine.
4131100	4133740	As part of the attempts to find more evidence later
4133740	4136280	and follow up on the original 1998 study,
4136280	4139160	a five-year-old autistic boy was given a colonoscopy
4139160	4140780	that went exceedingly wrong
4140780	4143080	and was left fighting for his life
4143080	4145540	with multiple organ failure after his bowel
4145540	4148420	was perforated in 12 places during the procedure.
4148420	4151880	There was no medical reason this child needed this procedure.
4151880	4154420	He was just being used as a guinea pig
4154420	4156200	to find any proof they could
4156200	4158540	that autistic enterocolitis was real.
4158540	4161580	The Royal Free had to pay almost £500,000,
4161580	4163460	roughly a million dollars today,
4163460	4165380	in damages to the boy and his parents
4165380	4167220	for causing lifelong disabilities
4167220	4168800	that required full-time care.
4168800	4171300	His parents reported that when they gave consent,
4171300	4173840	they had not been told of the risks.
4173840	4176980	If this is true, what happened here is an assault.
4176980	4178940	They almost killed this child,
4178940	4180900	and in the 1998 study,
4180900	4182940	they inflicted this procedure
4182960	4184840	on children as young as three.
4184840	4187040	Wakefield's consent form insists
4187040	4189800	that these procedures are usually tolerated well
4189800	4193020	by children and that it is entirely painless.
4193020	4195900	It gives zero mention of the very real risks
4195900	4199820	of inserting several feet of a scope into a child.
4199820	4200940	It even says,
4200940	4202860	if your child becomes distressed
4202860	4204740	or the procedure proves too difficult,
4204740	4207440	it will be performed under general anesthetic.
4207440	4208980	The form doesn't mention the risks
4208980	4210580	of this anesthetic either.
4210600	4213100	This normal consent form for a colonoscopy
4213100	4215300	makes incredibly clear that there are risks
4215300	4217100	of perforation and bleeding
4217100	4218720	and the possible adverse reactions
4218720	4220100	to being sedated too.
4220100	4221640	In case you're watching, Andy,
4221640	4223980	this is what informed consent looks like,
4223980	4224980	you piece of shi-
4224980	4226680	Wakefield needed these parents
4226680	4228360	to consent to these procedures.
4228360	4230860	His paycheck was resting on finding something
4230860	4232320	in the bowels of these children
4232320	4234020	that could possibly point to the disease
4234020	4235320	he was trying to invent,
4235320	4237780	so he wrote a handout that conveniently
4237780	4240360	didn't mention how risky some of these procedures
4240400	4241400	actually were.
4241400	4243100	And from other accounts given to Deer
4243100	4244940	about what happened during the study,
4244940	4246740	the children's experiences were far
4246740	4248120	from safe and painless.
4248120	4250240	Nurses were leaving and saying they didn't like
4250240	4252460	what was being done to these children.
4252460	4254280	Junior doctors were unhappy.
4254280	4256500	It needed three people to hold these kids down
4256500	4259800	in some cases just to have blood taken.
4259800	4261920	These are difficult children to explain
4261920	4263960	to what is going on.
4263960	4266040	I feel very sorry for the children
4266040	4268080	who I feel were being abused.
4268080	4270060	Children were fainting and vomiting
4270080	4271920	and trying to resist the testing.
4271920	4273920	They had to be force-fed some of the fluids
4273920	4275180	required for the tests.
4275180	4277640	They couldn't give one child their lumbar puncture
4277640	4280060	because he was uncontrollably vomiting
4280060	4281980	from all the other procedures that had been done on him
4281980	4282980	and it was sent home.
4282980	4284400	Another child's lumbar puncture
4284400	4286900	went so badly that he had to be rushed
4286900	4289320	to a different hospital for treatment.
4289320	4292240	If you do stuff like this to kids in your study
4292240	4294700	for no clinically justified reason,
4294700	4296620	that's child abuse!
4296620	4298160	Wakefield treated the children
4298180	4300400	as if they had genuine bowel conditions.
4300400	4301940	To that end, almost all of them
4301940	4303640	were given anti-inflammatory drugs
4303640	4305480	for the disorders he'd made up for them.
4305480	4308520	These medications often have an increased risk to children,
4308520	4310440	particularly under the age of six.
4310440	4311740	The risks of adverse events
4311740	4313900	includes life-threatening complications
4313900	4315360	including increased bleeding,
4315360	4316820	increased risk of infections,
4316820	4318580	and other severe side effects.
4318580	4320960	Some of these kids had problems communicating,
4320960	4322880	which would make reporting any side effects
4322880	4324960	they were experiencing very difficult,
4324960	4327460	further increasing the risk of severe problems
4327480	4328720	if something went wrong.
4328720	4330980	Considering that barely any of these children
4330980	4333020	actually had bowel disorders,
4333020	4335140	Wakefield was essentially putting children
4335140	4337440	at risk of the side effects of these drugs
4337440	4340200	for no reason while he looked for proof
4340200	4342160	of the disease he was trying to invent
4342160	4343820	to make a lawsuit look good.
4343820	4345540	The Medical Council also discovered
4345540	4347000	that during the study,
4347000	4349780	Wakefield gave an experimental drug
4349780	4352580	to one of the children without waiting for approval
4352580	4353800	from an ethics committee.
4353800	4354800	The drug was called
4354800	4358520	Dialysable Lymphocyte Extract Transfer Factor.
4358520	4360020	Wait a second.
4360020	4362640	The paper is a pilot study
4362640	4364560	on the effects of a substance called
4364560	4368360	Dialysable Lymphocyte Extract on children with autism.
4368360	4370480	Did Wakefield test one of Fudenberg's
4370480	4374160	autism-curing drugs on one of the children in his study?
4374160	4375160	What the fuck?
4375160	4376160	Thanks, Andy.
4376160	4377660	I'm sure whatever you gave those kids
4377660	4379000	was perfectly safe.
4379000	4380780	I mean, if this genius was behind it.
4380780	4382200	Where does that come from?
4382200	4383200	My bone marrow.
4383240	4385240	To convince the child's father to agree
4385240	4388400	to let him administer this drug to his child,
4388400	4391320	Wakefield offered him a job as managing director
4391320	4393820	of a company making and selling the drug.
4393820	4396420	Um, okay, my producer told me I can't say that.
4396420	4398380	There's no way of proving that happened
4398380	4400660	behind closed doors, so just to clarify,
4400660	4402580	we don't have evidence that Wakefield
4402580	4404500	offered a man a job to give his son a drug.
4404500	4406300	It might just be a coincidence
4406300	4408000	that the father became managing director
4408000	4409260	of a company that would profit
4409260	4410880	from selling the drug if it worked.
4410900	4412980	Maybe he just happened to have equity
4412980	4414780	in the company that would be making the drug
4414780	4417160	that was experimentally given to his child.
4417160	4420540	We will never know for sure how that happened.
4420540	4421540	Ahem.
4421540	4424460	Let's just walk through that again.
4424460	4428620	Andrew Wakefield might have offered a cushy job
4428620	4432460	to a guy to let him experiment on his kid
4432460	4435800	with a drug that he probably got from a guy
4435800	4438520	who got fired for stealing medical supplies,
4438520	4440020	wasn't a doctor anymore,
4440040	4441540	and thought he could cure autism
4441540	4443160	using his bone marrow.
4446840	4448420	The aristocrats.
4448420	4451960	On top of all of this, during the investigation,
4451960	4454500	the medical council found out that during one
4454500	4457760	of his own children's birthday parties,
4457760	4460640	Andrew Jeremy Wakefield lined up
4460640	4462640	all the other kids at the party
4462640	4465600	and offered them money for their blood.
4465600	4468360	I have to try and explain this.
4468360	4471200	In order to find any potentially useful evidence
4471200	4472860	for his study for the lawsuit,
4472860	4475960	he needed the blood of non-autistic children
4475960	4478380	so he could compare it and see what he could find,
4478380	4480420	but to get the blood, instead of, like,
4480420	4484300	putting in a request for non-autistic children's blood
4484300	4488000	or, like, calling for volunteers to come to the hospital
4488000	4490720	and give their blood and without running it past
4490720	4495600	an ethics committee, he offered his children's friends
4495640	4498640	£5 for their blood.
4498640	4499640	Ha ha ha!
4499640	4501980	And no, that's not, like, an allegation
4501980	4503940	that someone might have made up.
4503940	4508780	Wakefield told people that story at a conference in 1999.
4522400	4524540	At the hearing, he claimed to have made up
4524560	4526480	the part about throwing up and fainting
4526480	4527740	for dramatic effect.
4527740	4530400	His best defense of his extremely unethical
4530400	4534120	and weird behavior was that he made some of it up.
4534120	4536080	Shockingly, telling the ethics committee
4536080	4538880	that he was a fucking liar didn't help his case.
4538880	4540840	Speaking later in an interview,
4540840	4545420	Wakefield defended the birthday party child blood bribes,
4545420	4548040	saying it was all totally fine.
4548040	4551720	The only problem was that it did not have an approval
4551720	4554140	from the hospital ethics committee.
4554320	4556320	That does not make it unethical.
4556320	4560900	He's trying to well, actually, a fucking ethics board.
4560900	4563700	After reviewing all of this, in 2010,
4563700	4566360	the longest inquiry in general medical counsel history
4566360	4568540	concluded that Andrew Wakefield had failed
4568540	4569880	in his duties as a doctor,
4569880	4571880	acted against the interests of his patients,
4571880	4574460	and was, you know, a lying con man.
4574460	4575500	Sorry, that one was me.
4575500	4577260	And he was struck off the medical register,
4577260	4579640	making him no longer able to practice medicine
4579640	4581420	and officially not a doctor,
4581420	4584060	so whenever someone calls him a doctor in videos now,
4584060	4585180	they're making a mistake.
4585180	4586820	Look, I don't want to single this guy out,
4586820	4589280	but you shouldn't put doctor in his name.
4589280	4590440	He's not a doctor now.
4590440	4593780	Even in the documentary he made about himself in 2016,
4593780	4595440	he can't put doctor in front of his name.
4595440	4597440	He has to put MBBS.
4597440	4599240	Well, we know he's at least one kind of BS
4599240	4600240	if you know what I'm saying.
4600240	4601660	To quote the counsel's charges,
4601660	4605160	he showed callous disregard for any distress or pain
4605160	4606540	the children might suffer.
4606540	4607540	That same year,
4607540	4611580	the Lancet finally formally retracted the original study.
4611580	4614080	According to the Lancet's editor, Richard Horton,
4614080	4617160	it was utterly clear without any ambiguity at all
4617160	4619860	the statements in the paper were utterly false.
4619860	4621200	Well done, Richard.
4621200	4624540	Here's a round of applause for you.
4624540	4627280	Better too late than never, I guess.
4627280	4628840	That's not really an expression, is it?
4628840	4630880	The conclusion of the inquiry is protested
4630880	4633340	by Wakefield's remaining supporters.
4633340	4635460	We're with Wakefield!
4635460	4637340	We're with Wakefield!
4637340	4640140	While a news crew attempts to interview one of his critics,
4640160	4642200	one of his supporters attempts to shout him down
4642200	4643860	and make sure he can't say anything,
4643860	4645820	while another off-screen holds up a book
4645820	4648320	insisting it is they who are being silenced.
4648320	4651420	The irony is apparently lost on them.
4651420	4653340	Wakefield appeared before his flock
4653340	4655420	to say this was all completely unjust.
4655420	4658380	And I invite anyone to examine
4658380	4660100	the contents of these proceedings
4660100	4662920	and come to their own conclusions.
4662920	4666060	I think we just did, buddy.
4666060	4668440	Wakefield did lose a lot of his popularity
4668440	4671400	when the extent of his abuse and fraud was made known,
4671400	4673820	but he still had a few dedicated fans.
4673820	4675740	Often the parents of autistic children
4675740	4677120	who'd followed him so far
4677120	4679120	that they refused to accept what he did.
4679120	4681380	To Wakefield, these desperate people
4681380	4683120	are the perfect market.
4683120	4685040	I suspect the main reason he turned up
4685040	4686500	in the last few days of his hearing
4686500	4687960	was to advertise the book he'd written
4687960	4689800	all about it on national TV.
4689800	4692000	The book alleges that the Medical Council hearings
4692000	4694720	are just trying to crush him to protect vaccines.
4694720	4695760	He titled the book,
4696620	4698800	after one of the council's comments about him.
4698800	4700660	It's trying to be an ironic reference.
4700660	4702540	Like, he's accusing mainstream medicine
4702540	4705300	of callously disregarding the victims of MMR,
4705300	4707600	but I don't think he considered the implications
4707600	4710520	of quoting a doctor pointing out he abused children
4710520	4712480	on the cover of a book with a big picture
4712480	4713520	of his face on it.
4713520	4716020	It's a real if I did it situation.
4716020	4717180	Also in the dedication,
4717180	4719140	he thanks his long-suffering wife
4719140	4720520	who's with him here on the cover.
4720520	4722160	She's not his wife anymore though.
4722160	4723440	I guess she suffered enough
4723440	4725320	and like separate vaccines before it,
4725340	4727340	Wakefield made sure to recommend his book
4727340	4728880	in every interview he got.
4728880	4731600	These numbers, the dates were all fabricated
4731600	4733180	to sort of make a case.
4733180	4735260	Dr. Gupta, please, I urge you,
4735260	4736760	go and read my book.
4736760	4738480	You will understand it. Many people don't.
4738480	4741440	It's very funny watching him try to sell his merchandise
4741440	4743240	now that everyone knows he's a fraud.
4743240	4745940	If you read my book, you will be able to read the truth.
4745940	4748160	And has the BMJ read my book?
4748160	4751620	Have the doctors who apparently looked at all the records
4751620	4754280	read my book? No, because the truth is in that book.
4754500	4756420	Sir, I've read Brian Deer's report,
4756420	4757920	which is incredibly extensive.
4757920	4759520	Sir, I'm not here to let you pitch your book.
4759520	4761160	I'm here to have you answer questions.
4761160	4764960	If you read the record that I have set out in the book,
4764960	4766160	you will see the truth.
4766160	4769000	But sir, if you're lying, then your book is also a lie.
4769000	4771760	Wakefield's defense against Brian Deer's allegations,
4771760	4774600	now that suing him to shut him up has failed disastrously,
4774600	4776200	is to say Deer is a hit man
4776200	4779320	paid by vaccine manufacturers to ruin his career.
4779320	4780160	He is a hit man.
4780160	4781680	He's been brought in to take me down
4781680	4783960	because they are very, very concerned
4783960	4786080	about the adverse reactions to vaccines
4786080	4787120	that are occurring in children.
4787120	4788920	Wait a minute, sir. Let me just stop you right there.
4788920	4791960	You say he's a hit man and he's been brought in by they.
4791960	4793960	Who is they? Who is he a hit man for?
4793960	4795320	This is an independent journalist
4795320	4797440	who's won many awards.
4797440	4799600	Yeah, he's, uh, and he's, you know,
4799600	4800800	who brought this man in?
4800800	4802960	Who is paying this man? I don't know.
4802960	4805160	Who is behind Brian Deer's reporting?
4805160	4806400	Follow the money.
4806400	4808080	Also, buy my book, please.
4808080	4809800	Wakefield went on to claim later in the interview
4809800	4811600	that you're being paid by the Association
4811600	4813040	of British Pharmaceutical Industries.
4813080	4814080	Are you?
4814080	4815600	No, I'm not.
4815600	4818480	In 2011, New York Times Magazine staff writer
4818480	4820680	Susan Dominus caught up with Wakefield.
4820680	4822600	Though Wakefield presents himself to her
4822600	4824600	as someone whose career was destroyed
4824600	4827480	for going against the dogma that vaccines are safe,
4827480	4829880	Dominus is careful to point out that he does this
4829880	4831560	while signing copies of his book
4831560	4833600	for an enormous line of loyal followers,
4833600	4836000	one of whom is a tearful mother who blames herself
4836000	4837880	for not preventing her child's autism.
4837880	4839520	At the time the article was written,
4839520	4841200	Wakefield lived in a beautiful house
4841200	4843120	in a reclusive and expensive neighborhood
4843120	4844400	in Austin, Texas,
4844400	4847360	surrounded by many acres of hills and forest.
4847360	4849560	You can almost believe you're in Tuscany,
4849560	4851560	he says of the view from his back deck.
4851560	4853560	The book made him a decent amount of money,
4853560	4856120	as have his many paid speaking engagements
4856120	4858400	at anti-vaccine conferences where he's lauded
4858400	4860800	as the celebrity who got the movement started.
4860800	4862640	There's the hundreds of thousands of pounds
4862640	4864640	he got paid to do the study, of course,
4864640	4867040	and the multiple documentaries about him and his life
4867040	4868560	can't have been too shabby for him.
4868560	4870600	It's genuinely shocking how obviously
4870600	4872720	he's just grifting anti-vaccine people
4872720	4874120	for as much money as he can.
4874120	4876480	His 2016 film, Vaxxed,
4876480	4878840	is available at a discount on his website
4878840	4881040	if you buy it in a pack of ten.
4881040	4883080	Give a copy to your local legislators,
4883080	4885280	educators, and medical professionals.
4885280	4887440	Wakefield wants his followers to pay him
4887440	4889040	to do advertising for him.
4889040	4891080	When I look back at footage of the last day
4891080	4892600	of Wakefield's hearing,
4892600	4896080	I'm inevitably looking back at myself ten years ago
4896080	4899080	when I saw the same footage live on TV.
4899080	4901880	At the time, I saw these people as Wakefield's defenders,
4901880	4904880	but in a way, they were also his victims.
4904880	4907440	For a decade now, since I was a teenager,
4907440	4908880	I've been thinking about this woman
4908880	4909880	with the sign saying,
4909880	4912160	don't stifle uncomfortable science.
4912160	4913800	I remember I first noticed her
4913800	4915840	because I saw her and thought,
4915840	4917960	wait, is she wearing a Playboy scarf?
4917960	4919760	Surely the most uncomfortable thing
4919760	4922080	for these people here must be the possibility
4922080	4925280	the man they're here to defend has lied to them for money.
4925280	4927280	For someone who'd sided with Wakefield
4927280	4929680	during the scare, accepting that he had lied
4929680	4931360	would mean taking on some of the guilt
4931360	4932800	for helping to spread it.
4932800	4935040	One of the worst things about Wakefield's actions
4935040	4937360	is he's made these people complicit.
4937360	4939760	Maybe Wakefield actually cares about these people.
4939760	4941760	Maybe not, but either way,
4941760	4944000	their money spends just the same.
4944000	4946520	I wonder how many of these people bought his books
4946520	4948320	or his documentaries.
4948320	4949880	I wonder if any of them stop and think
4949880	4951760	about how they've made him rich.
4951760	4954040	Some of these people are extremely vulnerable,
4954040	4956160	parents of children with disabilities,
4956160	4958240	some of which require full-time care,
4958240	4960840	who fell for Wakefield because he was offering them
4960840	4964720	an explanation for why these things happen.
4964720	4967000	It brings me no joy to tell you
4967000	4969080	they paid for this view.
4969080	4971280	We're with Wakefield!
4971280	4973320	We're with Wakefield!
4973320	4975480	We're with Wakefield!
4975480	4977480	We're with Wakefield!
4977480	4982760	♪♪
4982760	4984320	At the end of all this,
4984360	4985880	I ask the eternal question
4985880	4988800	asked of every major fraudster in history.
4988800	4991000	How could someone do all this?
4991000	4993200	Cause all this fear and doubt
4993200	4995600	that has led to real, tangible harm
4995600	4998160	against your fellow human beings?
4998160	5001800	Why would someone do that?
5001800	5003840	Uh, money, thank you for watching.
5003880	5010880	-♪♪
5010880	5014880	-♪♪
5019880	5021360	-♪♪
5021360	5023000	There's probably a lot of people you could blame
5023000	5025320	for anti-vaccine beliefs getting as far as they have.
5025320	5027600	The anxieties people have right now
5027600	5029000	didn't come from nowhere.
5029000	5031920	Wakefield's legacy is built into the very DNA
5031920	5033720	of modern vaccine hesitancy.
5033760	5035600	Or the RNA, am I right?
5035600	5037240	Nice one, Kat. It's very clever.
5037240	5039720	Whenever you try to trace a trend of skepticism
5039720	5041320	about vaccines far enough,
5041320	5044080	it almost always leads back to the fear and anxiety
5044080	5047160	that started in 1998 and the men behind it.
5047160	5049240	Take, for example, Bill Maher.
5049240	5051040	Maher is a proponent of the possible link
5051040	5052360	between vaccines and autism
5052360	5055200	and frequently has anti-vaccine activists on his show.
5055200	5057840	Granted, he also has people on who think that's ridiculous,
5057840	5060560	so that's kind of like being fair and balanced.
5060560	5063040	His general stance is that vaccines can be good,
5063040	5064240	but he doesn't really go for them
5064240	5065640	because he's got a better idea.
5065640	5068080	I am not a germ theory denier.
5068080	5071320	I understand that germs and viruses cause diseases.
5071320	5072880	I may have been a little cocky about it
5072880	5075720	because I discovered from first-hand experience
5075720	5078840	that I could stave them off better with proper nutrition.
5078840	5080440	If your child dies of measles,
5080440	5082000	it's because he didn't eat his vegetables.
5082000	5083240	Bubonic plague!
5083240	5085280	Skip a trip to McDonald's, sheeple!
5085280	5088040	Throughout the years, Bill has repeated over and over
5088040	5089720	his distrust of vaccines
5089720	5091960	and the possible side effects they might pose.
5091960	5094280	I've tried to find an example of him citing a source
5094280	5095800	or giving some kind of data,
5095800	5097760	but no, it's always this general sense
5097760	5100040	that people think something might be wrong.
5100040	5102640	There's all these parents who say,
5102640	5104960	I had a normal child, got the vaccine.
5104960	5106640	This story keeps coming up.
5106640	5108240	Lots of parents are saying stuff,
5108240	5109760	and that's basically evidence,
5109760	5111560	and of course there's the old standout,
5111560	5113600	lots of people feel like me.
5113600	5116320	I was attacked for saying we should look into this
5116320	5117360	and I don't believe in it
5117360	5119240	and lots of people feel the same way.
5119240	5120640	I've heard a lot of stuff about feelings
5120640	5122240	being more important than facts,
5122240	5123960	so this is basically science, right?
5123960	5125560	Bill, you having us on the show
5125560	5126920	and rehashing all these problems
5126920	5129280	you got yourself into on your last show,
5129280	5131520	it's like going on a date and talking about your ex-wife.
5131520	5132520	Yeah!
5132520	5134240	Yeah!
5134240	5137280	If an intellectual titan like Bill Maher
5137280	5139120	thinks vaccines might be dangerous,
5139120	5141040	he must believe it for a good reason.
5141040	5142280	I did a lot of digging on this,
5142280	5143600	and I found a time when he made
5143600	5145880	a concrete scientific claim about vaccines.
5145880	5148880	In 2005, he was interviewed on Larry King Live.
5148880	5150360	This isn't footage of that interview.
5150360	5151640	I couldn't find footage of this one,
5151640	5153600	but there is a transcript on the CNN website.
5153600	5155720	During this interview, they discuss the flu shot,
5155720	5157840	which King had been taking for 25 years.
5157840	5159720	Maher tells him the best defense against disease
5159720	5162120	is to have a strong immune system.
5162120	5164000	I guess that's where the proper nutrition comes in
5164000	5165840	and says that the flu shot is actually bad
5165840	5166920	for your immune system.
5166920	5168520	He cites a strong distrust
5168520	5170840	of what he calls Western medicine,
5170840	5172800	which is a bit of a Eurocentric misnomer.
5172800	5175440	A lot of non-Western countries develop vaccines
5175440	5177080	and other modern medicine, you know.
5177080	5178080	Whatever. He doesn't care.
5178080	5180320	The conversation then turns to the avian flu,
5180360	5182160	which was a real concern at the time.
5182160	5184200	Bill states that he's not worried about bird flu
5184200	5187200	and gives a fascinatingly vague list of reasons why.
5187200	5189680	First of all, it's not going to happen,
5189680	5191880	which was a very clever insight
5191880	5194760	right up until something like that really did happen.
5194760	5197040	Uh, that's why people were worried about it, Bill.
5197040	5199280	Second of all, the fact it is mutating
5199280	5201720	shows that if you did come up with a vaccine tomorrow,
5201720	5204040	it wouldn't be effective against the disease
5204040	5206680	when the disease comes because the disease
5206680	5208640	is always morphing and mutating.
5208640	5210400	Bill is such a good public speaker.
5210400	5212400	The fact that vaccines actually help stop
5212400	5214000	the disease from spreading
5214000	5216080	and therefore developing those mutations
5216080	5218280	in the first place is lost on him.
5218280	5220920	Well, it was, but he got vaccinated for COVID-19,
5220920	5223160	so clearly he sees the value now.
5223160	5224680	This is attached to an announcement
5224680	5225960	that he got the virus,
5225960	5227880	so this week's show has to be canceled.
5227880	5230200	Apparently, he's asymptomatic and feels fine,
5230200	5232200	so I guess vaccines are pretty good, aren't they?
5232200	5235200	Considering how at-risk unvaccinated 65-year-olds
5235200	5236320	are for this virus,
5236320	5239080	I'm really glad he got vaccinated for his sake,
5239080	5241280	but they should probably just cancel his show completely.
5241280	5243480	I mean, we don't want to risk losing a national treasure.
5243480	5246880	The reality is a lot of pseudo-libertarian skepticism
5246880	5249640	about Western medicine instantly falls apart
5249640	5252040	the second it has to interact with reality
5252040	5254480	where people really do die of diseases.
5254480	5257200	For example, the man he is speaking to,
5257200	5259120	Larry King, passed away this year
5259120	5261320	of complications from COVID-19.
5261320	5263280	Anyway, Ma tells King that vaccines
5263280	5264600	are just a trick to get money.
5264600	5266040	It's just a way to funnel money
5266040	5268000	into the pharmaceutical companies.
5268000	5269240	Follow the money.
5269240	5271320	You'll find out where the bird flu is.
5271320	5272680	If bird flu had got bad enough,
5272680	5274520	you can guarantee Ma would have paid
5274520	5275880	top dollar for the vaccine.
5275880	5277480	Anyway, the discussion goes downhill
5277480	5279400	even further for Ma when King points out
5279400	5282840	that vaccines are great and polio was virtually eradicated
5282840	5284200	thanks to vaccination.
5284200	5286880	Bill gives this beautiful reply.
5286880	5289080	Yes, but, you know,
5289080	5291680	there are many books out that will...
5291680	5293160	that will...
5293160	5296200	and I'm not well enough versed on it to talk about it
5296200	5298760	that will indicate that there are other reasons
5298760	5300600	why it was.
5300600	5303240	And a lot of diseases that have been, they say,
5303240	5306520	whoa, this was eliminated because of a vaccine,
5306520	5308560	they find out, well, no, actually,
5308560	5312600	the country got toilets and that's what happened.
5312600	5314680	I think Bill really does a good job of summing up
5314680	5316960	a lot of people's beliefs about vaccination here.
5316960	5320200	Ma thinks it's smart to be skeptical about vaccines
5320200	5321800	right up until there's consequences
5321800	5322840	for himself, of course,
5322880	5324880	but his explanations are all unfounded
5324880	5326040	and unscientific.
5326040	5328760	The best he can say is there's probably books out there
5328760	5331000	that prove he's right, maybe,
5331000	5332520	but he's not read them.
5332520	5334520	This isn't skepticism.
5334520	5337680	This is ignorance trying to sound like skepticism.
5337680	5339040	To bring it all full circle,
5339040	5341240	it seems like Bill's beliefs about vaccines
5341240	5343000	are really based on that big scare
5343000	5344800	that started in the late 90s.
5344800	5347680	After all, the only factoid he seems to ever be able
5347680	5350000	to remember is that lots of parents said
5350000	5351520	they were bad that one time,
5351560	5352880	and that's not even a fact.
5352880	5354920	That's some opinions he remembers.
5354920	5357480	I'd joke that it's a pity they don't make a vaccine
5357480	5358800	for confirmation bias,
5358800	5360360	but he wouldn't have got it, would he?
5360360	5362520	There is, however, one time in this old interview
5362520	5365520	where he really does attempt to make a scientific claim.
5365520	5367760	He tells Larry that if you get the flu shot
5367760	5369560	more than five years in a row,
5369560	5373320	it tenfold increases the risk of getting Alzheimer's.
5373320	5375720	Hmm, that's a really specific thing to say.
5375720	5377400	Maybe by checking this claim out,
5377400	5379840	we can figure out who he's getting his beliefs from.
5379840	5381600	I looked, and there are actually studies
5381600	5384800	on the impact of vaccination on rates of Alzheimer's.
5384800	5388240	Um, the risk of Alzheimer's goes down.
5388240	5390120	Okay, so this clearly isn't his source.
5390120	5391560	I did some more digging, though,
5391560	5395040	and I found that in 1997 at a vaccine conference,
5395040	5396480	in one guy's presentation,
5396480	5400280	he said that a scientist had found that this happens.
5400280	5401720	There's no study cited here,
5401720	5404400	but that's at least a source for Bill's claims.
5404400	5405600	Let's check the doctor's papers
5405600	5407320	and see if we can find out for ourselves.
5407320	5409480	Wait a second. I blurred the scientist's name out
5409480	5411400	by accident. Let me fix that.
5411400	5413680	Dr. Hugh Fudenberg?
5413680	5414680	Wahahahaha!
5414680	5417640	No matter how you look at it,
5417640	5420680	a vast, vast majority of anti-vaccine rhetoric
5420680	5423320	and pseudoscience can be traced directly back
5423320	5424720	to these two guys.
5424720	5427160	According to a survey of U.S. health care professionals
5427160	5431240	in 2016, 77% of parents refusing vaccination
5431240	5434720	for their children still cite a fear of a link with autism.
5434720	5437240	When people refuse medicine for their children,
5437240	5439560	they largely point to the hazy memory
5439560	5441840	of the scare Wakefield started for money.
5441840	5444160	So yeah, it's pretty important to point out
5444160	5445880	they both lost their medical licenses
5445880	5447400	and their science was garbage,
5447400	5450240	and despite being an obvious hack, fraud, con man,
5450240	5453360	Wakefield is still embraced by the anti-vaccine community.
5453360	5456400	Wakefield was a guest of honor at Conspiracy,
5456400	5459640	the week-long cruise for all kinds of conspiracy theorists
5459640	5462480	where believers of all stripes gather to share their theories
5462480	5464880	about climate change, the Earth being flat,
5464920	5467240	time travelers, and horses being real.
5467240	5469600	The kind of funny thing is Wakefield himself
5469600	5471440	seems pretty embarrassed by this.
5471440	5474560	A skeptic who went on the cruise noted how unhappy he looked
5474560	5477160	with the implication of being a hero to a community
5477160	5479880	that absolutely loves complete quacks.
5479880	5482760	The story of my life is basically how to take
5482760	5486080	a perfectly good career and flush it down the toilet.
5486080	5488760	Luckily for Wakefield, the toilet is full of money,
5488760	5491040	and all he has to do to get it is lean further
5491040	5494480	and further away from science and deeper into this culture.
5494480	5497160	He's had to pivot to saying all vaccines are dangerous
5497160	5499160	because his new anti-vaccine audience
5499160	5501000	aren't very receptive to the old claim
5501000	5504280	that I'm not anti-vaccine, just one vaccine is dangerous,
5504280	5506200	and I recommend mine instead.
5506200	5509560	I don't think these people would buy a 10-pack of that story.
5509560	5511720	And of course, in the middle of the pandemic
5511720	5513360	that is currently happening,
5513360	5516200	Wakefield emerged from his mansion to remind everyone
5516200	5520040	that a virus that has so far killed over three million people
5520040	5523200	is better than being vaccinated against it.
5523240	5525720	As Nelson Mandela said at his trial,
5525720	5528320	there are ideals worth dying for.
5528320	5530200	Presumably of COVID-19.
5530200	5532120	I don't want to get too dramatic,
5532120	5537080	but better to die as a free man than live as a slave!
5540440	5541920	I don't think that was too dramatic, do you?
5541920	5544200	The fact the movement he started is still based
5544200	5548280	almost completely on his lies is pretty important to point out,
5548280	5550920	and in fact, it's useful to point it out
5550920	5552880	because despite how it might look,
5552880	5555360	the truth can be a powerful thing.
5555360	5557520	Once Wakefield got chased out to America
5557520	5559360	and had his medical license taken away,
5559360	5561640	vaccination rates in the UK recovered.
5561640	5563600	I love this because you can basically see
5563600	5566600	the effects of Brian Deer's reporting on a graph.
5566600	5569000	Like, the scare starts, and it gets worse and worse and worse,
5569000	5570760	and then Brian Deer's reporting comes out,
5570760	5572320	and bam, it's on its way back up.
5572320	5574480	Like, the truth does make a difference.
5574480	5577120	And then when Wakefield's license was taken away,
5577120	5579920	we went right back up to pre-scare levels.
5579920	5581880	Of course, getting chased out to America
5581920	5584120	meant he started peddling his lies in America,
5584120	5586800	so sorry about that, but it does seem pretty clear
5586800	5589120	that the truth helps people make up their minds
5589120	5590120	about this stuff.
5590120	5591680	Fascinatingly, a lot of Britain
5591680	5593440	seems to remember the MMR scare
5593440	5595400	and the revelation that it was based on lies
5595400	5597880	and learned a lesson about vaccine alarmism.
5597880	5599880	According to polls of global willingness
5599880	5601800	to take the COVID-19 vaccine,
5601800	5603880	other countries start relatively low,
5603880	5605800	perhaps dimly remembering some people
5605800	5607200	saying vaccines are bad.
5607200	5609960	Then acceptance grows as it becomes increasingly clear
5609960	5611400	the new vaccines are safe.
5611400	5612520	Wait, where's the UK?
5612520	5614560	Well, boys, we're just chilling up here.
5614560	5616440	We've been through this before, you see.
5616440	5617760	That's my British accent?
5617760	5619280	It seems like our past experience
5619280	5621080	with bullshit vaccine scares
5621080	5624320	has inoculated us against future ones.
5624320	5625320	Cat wrote that line.
5625320	5627280	I didn't find the one weird trick
5627280	5629240	doctors hate to deconverting people
5629240	5630480	from being against vaccines
5630480	5632760	and changing their minds or anything here.
5632760	5634320	What we've really discovered is that
5634320	5637360	if you lay the whole story out like this,
5637360	5639800	people can do a good job of making up their own minds.
5639800	5643160	The actual scientific community works very hard
5643160	5645480	to be receptive to potential side effects.
5645480	5648600	When even the potential maybe possibility maybe
5648600	5651200	of one of the vaccines having side effects came up,
5651200	5653560	the FDA and the CDC briefly recommended
5653560	5655400	not getting it for a while until later
5655400	5657520	when they checked and were sure it was fine.
5657520	5660640	Vaccine safety is taken extremely seriously
5660640	5664200	by medical scientists and doctors for obvious reasons.
5664200	5666520	Actually, here's a fun example of how stringent
5666520	5668280	the community is about vaccines.
5668280	5669920	Wakefield's alternative vaccine
5669920	5671800	was based on such bad science,
5671800	5674440	it would never have made it out of clinical trials.
5674440	5676760	The medical work behind it was awful.
5676760	5678160	I mean, one of its author's names
5678160	5680240	is spelled wrong on page one.
5680240	5681960	The science on the following pages
5681960	5684520	is roughly what you'd expect from something like that.
5684520	5687120	I think I might actually make a bonus video for patrons
5687120	5689200	just covering this vaccine patent
5689200	5691360	because it is whack.
5691360	5694520	Really, Andrew Wakefield was always doomed
5694520	5696160	to end up as a scam artist.
5696160	5698000	He wasn't very good at the science
5698040	5699240	when he was a doctor.
5699240	5702040	All the coronavirus vaccines currently in use
5702040	5703840	have passed tests and checks
5703840	5705640	that his alternative measles vaccine
5705640	5706840	would never have done.
5706840	5709680	Wakefield can pretend he's not gonna get the vaccine
5709680	5712080	and appear at health freedom summits
5712080	5713680	that recommend you don't get it
5713680	5715280	and instead eliminate toxins
5715280	5718520	with only affordable products and cooking hacks,
5718520	5720080	but I certainly hope for his sake
5720080	5722240	that he just gets the vaccine in secret
5722240	5723840	because otherwise the next cruise
5723840	5725600	is gonna have a fucking body count.
5725600	5728280	There is another way the truth can change people's minds.
5728280	5729480	Living proof.
5729480	5731560	If someone thinks the coronavirus vaccines
5731560	5732520	might be dangerous,
5732520	5733880	one of the best ways to help
5733880	5736000	seems to be people around them getting it
5736000	5737480	and showing them how it's fine.
5737480	5739760	In early polls before a vaccine was out,
5739760	5741240	a lot of people in the USA
5741240	5742600	claimed they were going to hold off
5742600	5744200	until they were sure it was safe,
5744200	5745920	which is a pretty risky decision
5745920	5747640	considering the danger of the virus
5747640	5750320	versus any possible side effects of the vaccine.
5750320	5752280	Like, a third of people who get infected,
5752280	5753360	even if it's minor,
5753360	5755600	are left with long-term complications,
5755600	5757800	like long-distance runners are left unable
5757800	5760080	to climb stairs without getting out of breath,
5760080	5761600	people have lost eyesight,
5761600	5763000	people have lost teeth,
5763000	5766080	and of course a lot of people have died of the disease,
5766080	5769800	but over time as more and more people did get the vaccine,
5769800	5772440	that by itself changed a lot of minds.
5772440	5774800	The truth is it was easy in 2020
5774800	5777320	to have your doubts about a theoretical vaccine
5777320	5778680	that no one had had yet,
5778680	5781600	but now when half the people around you already have it
5781600	5782880	and they're obviously fine,
5782880	5785520	it's a whole lot harder to have those doubts.
5785520	5787680	Over time, the people waiting and seeing
5787680	5789680	seem to have decided they've seen enough
5789680	5791280	and they want what those guys are having,
5791280	5794120	so this is my call to action in case anyone needs it.
5794120	5796680	You should get a COVID vaccine if you can.
5796680	5799400	You know, get one while you're there for your colonoscopy.
5799400	5801320	The vaccine makes life safer for you
5801320	5803800	and reduces the possibility of passing the virus
5803800	5805040	to someone more vulnerable,
5805040	5807080	so you won't have that on your conscience either.
5807080	5810240	I know having a conscience is virtue signaling now,
5810240	5811880	but still, it's a nice bonus,
5811880	5813080	and on top of that,
5813080	5815720	if there are people in your life who could be at risk
5815720	5818160	who need convincing of the vaccine's safety,
5818160	5820640	you could be the evidence they need.
5820640	5823200	It's amazing how compelling seeing other people
5823200	5824600	get vaccinated can be.
5824600	5828480	There is, sadly, one concerning thing about the data.
5828480	5830040	There are some people who started out
5830040	5831800	saying no to vaccination
5831800	5833680	and have largely stayed that way.
5833680	5835000	Maybe some of them will budge
5835000	5837000	as more and more people get vaccinated,
5837000	5839880	but there's probably a group who are so distrustful
5839880	5841440	of vaccines because of everything
5841440	5842640	we've discussed so far
5842640	5844480	that they can't have their minds changed
5844480	5846080	even by the hundreds of millions
5846080	5848720	of obviously completely safely vaccinated people
5848720	5849720	all around them.
5849720	5852360	People can invest a lot of ego and pride
5852360	5853760	in not accepting evidence
5853760	5855960	that contradicts their beliefs about the world,
5855960	5858760	and it really doesn't help that there are hundreds of people
5858760	5860680	exactly like Andrew Wakefield
5860680	5862640	who are ready to tell them everything they believe
5862640	5863640	is already true,
5863640	5865960	and they just need to buy their supplements
5865960	5868840	or DVDs or cooking hacks
5868840	5871000	and enable people to convince themselves
5871000	5873560	that they don't need to do any more thinking
5873560	5875280	for a small fee, of course.
5875280	5876280	Aw, come on, though.
5876280	5877920	Comparing Wakefield to Alex Jones,
5877920	5878920	that's a bit much.
5878920	5880600	There's no way Wakefield would stoop to...
5880600	5881600	Ha ha ha!
5881600	5883040	Have you learned nothing?
5883040	5884040	Good to have you here with us.
5884040	5885040	It's great to be here, Alex.
5885040	5886040	Thank you very much.
5886040	5887360	Changing these people's minds
5887360	5888680	really should be their job,
5888680	5890120	and it's nobody else's fault
5890120	5891320	that they're struggling with it,
5891320	5893960	but I think the future of this kind of discussion
5893960	5896040	resides in finding more compelling ways
5896040	5897480	of communicating the truth
5897520	5899520	to people who aren't used to hearing it.
5899520	5902000	I hope in some way this video has helped.
5902000	5903560	In the meantime, while we figure out
5903560	5905440	how to convince people who seem committed
5905440	5906840	to being never convinced,
5906840	5909000	at least the vaccine intended for them
5909000	5911280	can go to someone who's sure they want it.
5911280	5913080	Specifically, me.
5913080	5915040	Please send me their vaccine.
5915040	5917280	I was glad they were testing it on the old people first,
5917280	5918840	but it's been months now, and I want it.
5918840	5920520	I want to go outside.
5920520	5921920	Be able to go outside.
5921920	5924160	I want to pretend I shop at Waitrose again.
5924160	5926440	I want to use my free football tickets.
5926480	5928280	I want to taunt my former hairdresser
5928280	5930040	with how useless she is to me now
5930040	5931560	and threaten to turn her building
5931560	5933320	back into a research foundation.
5933320	5934960	Give me the vaccine, doctor.
5934960	5936280	Hell, give me all of them.
5936280	5937840	Let me combine their power.
5937840	5941120	Soon I will be unstoppable.
5941120	5944080	It's easy to get depressed and begin to believe
5944080	5946440	that you're basically locked in a room
5946440	5949360	with thousands of fucking idiots
5949360	5952640	who are just willing to say stupid shit constantly,
5952640	5955560	just committed to just being wrong,
5955560	5959440	but actually, the more I think about it,
5959440	5962960	I'm actually locked in a planet
5962960	5966720	with millions of people who do know better than these people,
5966720	5969760	but they're just so busy being depressed like me at them.
5969760	5972160	Maybe the answer here is that we just need to accept
5972160	5973920	that we should put the depression energy
5973920	5975320	into making a difference,
5975320	5977640	into changing the minds of the people who can be,
5977640	5980520	and into doing what we can to improve the state of our world
5980520	5982040	around these people,
5982040	5983880	and just let them be mad
5983880	5985960	and let them continue to be stupid,
5985960	5988160	but in a world where their kids won't die of polio
5988160	5990360	because we got rid of it for them.
5990360	5992840	Good for them, ignorant little wankers,
5992840	5994240	because maybe the hard thing to do
5994240	5997040	when we're confronted by the scope of these problems
5997040	6000440	is accept that we really can do something about it.
6000440	6003520	No matter how hopeless things may seem,
6003520	6006840	the world always can get better,
6006840	6009720	and maybe together,
6009720	6012560	someday, we can invent a way
6012560	6015400	of cleaning up this fucking mess in my mom's garage,
6015400	6016400	in my garage.
6042720	6043720	Hey, thank you for watching.
6043720	6044960	That was pretty good, wasn't it?
6044960	6047280	I managed to avoid getting too preachy at the end there.
6047280	6048400	I'd like to thank my patrons,
6048400	6050080	whose names are scrolling past the screen right now.
6050080	6051800	You guys literally keep the lights on.
6051800	6053400	I'd like to thank the sensitivity reader
6053400	6054720	who took a look at some of the segments
6054720	6056520	and made sure that we were using the appropriate language
6056520	6057720	when we were talking about autism.
6057720	6060680	I'd also really like to thank Brian Deer,
6060680	6062680	who's basically a superhero.
6062680	6065920	He's the guy who found out most of this stuff,
6065920	6067360	really saved the day,
6067360	6070120	and just thank you so much, man.
6070120	6072120	And also, while we were making this video,
6072120	6074520	Brian Deer released a book about the whole thing.
6074520	6075520	Deer's book,
6075520	6076920	the Doctor Who Fooled the World,
6076920	6079200	is basically the most definitive source
6079200	6081200	on Andrew Wakefield and all the damage he did.
6081200	6083040	I literally cannot recommend it enough
6083040	6084600	if the topic interests you at all.
6084600	6087040	Deer is by far the most knowledgeable person
6087040	6088200	on everything that happened.
6088200	6089440	I mean, he's the guy who discovered
6089440	6091680	most of it himself through actual decades
6091680	6093080	of investigative reporting.
6093080	6094840	I had no idea he was doing a book
6094840	6097080	until it came out when I was writing this video,
6097080	6098080	and with that,
6098080	6099880	it came out when I was writing this video,
6099880	6101480	and we just barely scratched the surface
6101480	6102480	of the stuff he covers.
6102480	6104180	There's a link to his site in the description,
6104180	6105820	and it's not an affiliate link or anything.
6105820	6107280	We're not being paid to do this.
6107280	6109720	I've decided he deserves your money.
6109720	6112120	I want him to be able to chart the release of this video
6112120	6113760	on a graph of his sales figures.
6113760	6115460	That's my personal fantasy.
6115460	6116860	Tell him Hbomb says hi.
6116860	6118860	If you want to know more about this whole topic
6118860	6122660	or just check out Brian Deer's honestly heroic reporting,
6122660	6124300	you should really go read his book
6124300	6126440	and go to briandeer.com
6126440	6128500	because it survived the lawsuit
6128500	6130040	and there's some great stuff there.
6130040	6132880	So thanks to Kat for doing all of that additional research
6132880	6134480	and for co-writing a lot of these segments
6134480	6136280	and just generally fact-checking me.
6136280	6137840	I got a lot of facts wrong,
6137840	6140640	and I'd like to thank my, uh, intern, Rachel,
6140640	6143280	uh, who did great work with the camera.
6143280	6144520	Don't do that.
6144520	6147020	Heh, heh, heh, heh.
6147020	6148560	Oh, wow, there are more credits.
6148560	6149560	Oh, my God.
6149560	6150560	Thank you so much for being
6150560	6151560	so patient with this video.
6151560	6152560	I'm actually surprised
6152560	6154560	we got it done so quickly, to be honest.
6154560	6155700	We had a whole production.
6155720	6157420	Like, we had to work with fact-checkers,
6157420	6159120	lawyers in two different countries
6159120	6160500	to make sure we couldn't get sued
6160500	6162160	for anything we were saying about these people
6162160	6163400	because, you know, you might have noticed
6163400	6165560	some of the characters in this story are litigious.
6165560	6167900	We conferred with vaccine experts,
6167900	6169700	doctors, science communicators,
6169700	6172840	medical researchers, sensitivity readers, animators.
6172840	6175180	You know, someone had to draw the internal anatomy
6175180	6176180	for that one thing.
6176180	6177720	I made an award-winning cartoonist
6177720	6180620	for the New Yorker spend hours of her life
6180620	6182780	drawing the courtroom from Phoenix Wright
6182800	6185940	for a joke that went by in, like, 10 seconds.
6185940	6187340	Sorry about that, by the way,
6187340	6189780	and my poor, long-suffering producer, Kat,
6189780	6191540	had to coordinate most of this for me
6191540	6193820	because I was busy editing the actual video,
6193820	6195020	and thank you to my patrons
6195020	6196620	for watching an early draft of this
6196620	6197620	and giving me feedback.
6197620	6198780	It turns out a bunch of people
6198780	6200820	who watch my videos are, like, scientists,
6200820	6202620	so we got some really good notes from them.
6202620	6204160	All in all, I'm pretty happy
6204160	6205560	with how this video turned out,
6205560	6207060	so, yeah, that's nice.
6207060	6208760	That said, I'm never putting this much effort
6208760	6210100	into a video again.
6210100	6211100	Forget it.
6211760	6222360	♪♪
6222360	6224140	Can you believe that Brian David Gilbert
6224140	6225140	did voices in this video?
6225140	6226800	That's great. It's amazing.
6226800	6228240	He sent me just video footage
6228240	6229840	of him dressed as Andrew Wakefield.
6229840	6231080	I didn't ask for him to do that.
6231080	6232440	He just sent that to me.
6232440	6233820	Like, what a cool guy.
6233820	6234820	That was great.
6241520	6242460	Oh!
6242460	6243500	Oh!
6243500	6245500	Oh!
