00:08.580 --> 00:10.080
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

00:10.080 --> 00:12.960
Don't worry. Vaccines are perfectly safe.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.300
According to me, you might notice a little prick.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.640
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

00:17.640 --> 00:19.100
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

00:19.100 --> 00:20.520
Ah-ha!

00:20.520 --> 00:21.400
Ugh.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.940
Hello, and welcome back to hell.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.060
I'm just vaccinating my profiteroles,

00:25.060 --> 00:27.140
immunizing them against the horrendous disease

00:27.140 --> 00:29.140
known only as not-enough-cream,

00:29.160 --> 00:30.840
itis.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.840
Unfortunately, while vaccines are great

00:32.840 --> 00:34.460
at stimulating my balls,

00:34.460 --> 00:37.220
in humans, they've become quite the controversial topic.

00:37.220 --> 00:39.300
In the late 90s, an anti-vaccine movement

00:39.300 --> 00:40.520
started to pick up steam,

00:40.520 --> 00:42.220
claiming that they cause autism.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.480
And the movement has plenty of washed-up celebrities

00:44.480 --> 00:46.400
flushing it, including What's-His-Name

00:46.400 --> 00:47.600
and that one

00:47.600 --> 00:48.780
and some more.

00:48.780 --> 00:51.060
Here's 45th President of the United States,

00:51.060 --> 00:53.700
Donald Trump, coming out against...medicine.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.360
He once famously tweet,

00:55.380 --> 00:57.300
No more massive injections.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.260
Tiny children are not horses.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.520
I mean, of course they aren't.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.220
Horses aren't even real.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.260
But if there's an entire movement of people

01:04.260 --> 01:07.520
with documentaries and websites and Facebook pages

01:07.520 --> 01:09.820
with thousands and thousands of members

01:09.820 --> 01:12.520
backed by the former U.S. president,

01:12.520 --> 01:14.320
why does everyone else seem to think

01:14.320 --> 01:15.520
they're obviously wrong?

01:15.520 --> 01:17.700
Has the mainstream medical establishment

01:17.700 --> 01:19.940
science-cucked a majority of people

01:19.940 --> 01:20.980
into thinking they're safe

01:20.980 --> 01:22.860
so they can keep making money selling them?

01:22.860 --> 01:24.940
The vaccine debate is complex

01:24.940 --> 01:26.060
and multilayered

01:26.060 --> 01:28.600
and hasn't been resolved for over two decades.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.060
So obviously it needs me to come and put an end to it

01:31.060 --> 01:33.320
in the space of a single YouTube video

01:33.320 --> 01:34.900
by doing what I'm best at,

01:34.900 --> 01:37.320
destroying things with my mouth.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.440
Oh!

01:38.440 --> 01:40.020
Oh!

01:40.020 --> 01:41.100
Oh!

01:41.100 --> 01:42.140
Mm!

01:42.140 --> 01:44.060
Oh!

01:44.060 --> 01:45.480
Oh, hi, Mum.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.480
Was I vaccinated?

01:48.480 --> 01:53.320
Have you been looking into moving out lately, son?

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
Mm.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.320
Now, the clever clogs among you

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
will know that there was an anti-vaccine movement

02:00.320 --> 02:03.060
of sorts in the 1800s when they were first introduced,

02:03.060 --> 02:06.200
but that movement died out on its own a long time ago.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
Oh, smallpox.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.740
The main argument in the modern movement

02:08.740 --> 02:10.060
is that they might cause autism.

02:10.060 --> 02:13.900
So let's see what, on paper, this claim is supported by.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.020
Yes, I just ended a sentence with a preposition,

02:16.020 --> 02:17.820
and if that annoyed you, we get it.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.940
Your school was expensive.

02:18.940 --> 02:20.240
We're all very happy for you.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.020
Part one, the easy version,

02:22.060 --> 02:23.220
in case you don't feel like watching

02:23.220 --> 02:25.560
this whole fucking video.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.020
In 1998, a study came out alleging a link

02:28.020 --> 02:30.100
between the MMR vaccine and autism.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.820
MMR vaccinates against measles, mumps, and rubella,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.440
which saves kids from having to get multiple painful shots

02:35.440 --> 02:37.720
and parents from having to know what rubella is.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.940
It was published in the Lancet,

02:38.940 --> 02:40.440
a very well-known medical journal,

02:40.440 --> 02:41.860
which made it seem credible.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.020
However, the paper was eventually found guilty

02:44.020 --> 02:45.560
of being bad.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.020
The science turned out to be bonkers,

02:48.020 --> 02:51.260
and multiple other studies on literally millions of children

02:51.300 --> 02:53.180
did not show that there was a link,

02:53.180 --> 02:54.840
and the paper was eventually retracted

02:54.840 --> 02:56.500
by the journal that published it.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.180
So retracted that it literally has

02:59.180 --> 03:02.460
retracted written all across every page

03:02.460 --> 03:04.760
in big red letters.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.460
My printer just does black and white,

03:06.460 --> 03:08.180
so I've actually got an artist's impression

03:08.180 --> 03:09.140
of the real version.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.000
So far, that's some pretty shaky ground

03:11.000 --> 03:12.260
on the anti-vaccine side,

03:12.260 --> 03:15.180
but later, new evidence came out that...

03:15.180 --> 03:16.800
Oh, that's it. That's all the evidence.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.760
This segment is over now.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.720
Part two, the existential horror of...

03:19.720 --> 03:20.560
Wait, that's it?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.980
No, seriously, that's all the evidence.

03:22.980 --> 03:25.980
There is nothing else even remotely credible.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.100
There are some fringe pet theories

03:28.100 --> 03:31.760
as to what chemical in the vaccines causes the autism,

03:31.760 --> 03:34.360
but since vaccines don't cause autism,

03:34.360 --> 03:37.760
they're kind of putting the cart before the squid here.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.140
The anti-vax movement had next to no evidence 20 years ago,

03:41.140 --> 03:42.900
and now they have even less.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.560
But hold on there, Daddy-O.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.060
Sure, you can sum up the entire issue in 52 seconds.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.140
Wow. But really, I don't think that's good enough.

03:50.140 --> 03:52.100
Everyone who's anti-vax at this point

03:52.100 --> 03:53.720
has probably already heard

03:53.720 --> 03:56.380
and isn't convinced by the easy version.

03:56.380 --> 03:58.260
I mean, if you're on the fence about vaccines,

03:58.260 --> 03:59.340
you're not gonna change your mind

03:59.340 --> 04:01.380
because someone told you there was a paper once

04:01.380 --> 04:02.560
but it got retracted,

04:02.560 --> 04:04.020
no matter how much they pitch-shift

04:04.020 --> 04:05.140
their voice in post.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.560
Blue crash.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.720
But what if you did want to change someone's mind

04:08.720 --> 04:10.300
on topics like this?

04:10.300 --> 04:12.480
The data on this issue is discouraging.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.140
Research shows that when someone becomes

04:14.140 --> 04:16.100
personally invested in an idea,

04:16.100 --> 04:18.020
they can become very closed-minded,

04:18.020 --> 04:20.060
or worse, a YouTuber.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.020
Political science professor Brendan Nyhan

04:22.020 --> 04:23.480
and his team spent three years

04:23.480 --> 04:25.560
studying how over 1,700 parents

04:25.560 --> 04:27.260
reacted to various different attempts

04:27.260 --> 04:29.100
to convince them to vaccinate their children

04:29.100 --> 04:31.020
and found that no matter what they tried,

04:31.020 --> 04:33.060
parents who started out against vaccination

04:33.060 --> 04:34.260
didn't change their minds,

04:34.260 --> 04:36.600
and worse, trying to correct false claims

04:36.600 --> 04:38.600
about vaccines actually made some parents

04:38.600 --> 04:40.260
more against vaccinating.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.560
Nyhan told the New Yorker,

04:41.560 --> 04:42.640
it's depressing.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.560
We were definitely depressed.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.900
Now, as a fellow fan of logic and reason,

04:46.940 --> 04:48.860
I'm also doing great,

04:48.860 --> 04:51.280
but in today's particular, shall we say,

04:51.280 --> 04:53.140
socioeconomic climate,

04:53.140 --> 04:55.060
it's extra pressing that we figure out

04:55.060 --> 04:56.820
how to get everyone on the same page

04:56.820 --> 04:58.360
with regards to public health.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.900
So the purpose of this video isn't just

04:59.900 --> 05:02.240
to point out a group that's wrong about something.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.600
The real question is,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
when someone is wrong about something,

05:05.600 --> 05:08.060
not just this, how do you change their mind?

05:08.060 --> 05:10.600
Now, personally, I'm not sure how to do that.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.180
If it was easy for humans to change their mind

05:13.180 --> 05:16.180
about stuff, then this video wouldn't need to exist,

05:16.180 --> 05:18.540
would it? But maybe we'll find some answers

05:18.540 --> 05:20.420
by exploring what convinced people

05:20.420 --> 05:22.420
vaccines might be dangerous in the first place.

05:22.420 --> 05:25.580
We should probably begin with that old 1998 study

05:25.580 --> 05:27.180
because, let's be honest,

05:27.180 --> 05:30.080
how many people on either side of this discussion

05:30.080 --> 05:31.380
have actually read it?

05:31.380 --> 05:33.840
People don't read scientific papers.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.260
They check out the blogs or videos of people

05:36.260 --> 05:37.420
who they already agree with,

05:37.420 --> 05:40.080
and they tell them what the science said.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.420
And I mean, same.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.300
I heard all the other people say the science was bad,

05:44.300 --> 05:45.840
and I believed them.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.800
And the anti-vax people probably just believed

05:47.800 --> 05:49.500
whoever told them it was true.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.660
So to be unbiased about this,

05:51.660 --> 05:53.920
let's really start at the beginning.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.760
Look at the original paper.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.760
That's the wrong page.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.760
Let's actually read this old paper

06:00.760 --> 06:02.800
and see what it has to say

06:02.800 --> 06:05.380
and come to an honest conclusion about its findings.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.880
Five minutes later.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.160
What the fuck?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.540
This is why people are against vaccines?

06:10.540 --> 06:13.120
This is the worst fucking paper I've ever read in my life!

06:13.120 --> 06:18.280
♪♪

06:18.280 --> 06:21.160
♪♪

06:21.160 --> 06:22.700
Ah.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.400
Right, let's talk about the study.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.540
I'm calling it the study because its real title

06:26.540 --> 06:28.820
was Ileal Lymphoid Nodular Hyperplasia,

06:28.820 --> 06:30.080
Nonspecific Colitis,

06:30.080 --> 06:32.440
and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children,

06:32.440 --> 06:34.080
which is a bit of a tongue twister.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.540
I had to do a not insignificant amount of Googling

06:36.540 --> 06:39.440
to find out whether it's pronounced Ileal or I-leal.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.040
Don't know why I bothered. If I got it wrong,

06:41.040 --> 06:42.320
it's not like you would have noticed.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.140
The paper's lead author is Dr. Andrew Wakefield.

06:45.140 --> 06:46.860
I'm sorry. There's a mistake in my script.

06:46.860 --> 06:50.560
The paper's lead author is disgraced ex-Dr. Andrew Wakefield.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.440
Wakefield is seen by many as the founder

06:52.440 --> 06:53.980
of the modern anti-vaccine movement

06:53.980 --> 06:56.520
since he was behind the paper that started the whole thing.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.680
Let's keep an eye on that guy. Oh, fucking!

06:58.680 --> 07:01.020
The smoke machine occasionally goes off on its own

07:01.020 --> 07:02.900
for no reason, and I can't be bothered to get up.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.240
The paper's supposed purpose was to investigate

07:05.240 --> 07:07.140
a connection between bowel disorders

07:07.140 --> 07:08.900
and developmental issues in children,

07:08.900 --> 07:10.980
in particular targeting signs of autism.

07:11.060 --> 07:13.060
So first off, what's a colitis?

07:13.060 --> 07:14.720
Right, uh, hold on.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.980
Okay, colitis is inflammation of the colon,

07:16.980 --> 07:18.900
one of the main symptoms of bowel diseases

07:18.900 --> 07:20.560
like Crohn's disease, for example.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.600
Colitis. By the way, we're gonna use words

07:22.600 --> 07:24.600
like bowel, colon, and intestine

07:24.600 --> 07:26.180
interchangeably in this video.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.300
Don't let it confuse you. They're mostly the same thing.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.940
If you're a doctor, pretend you didn't hear that.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.140
The paper says non-specific colitis

07:32.140 --> 07:35.100
because it's not looking for specific kinds of inflammation.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.680
It's looking at whatever inflammation

07:36.680 --> 07:39.340
these children happen to have and seeing how they compare

07:39.340 --> 07:40.700
because maybe they're all linked,

07:40.700 --> 07:43.000
and maybe they're even linked to the autism.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.340
According to Wakefield, he just happened to notice

07:46.340 --> 07:49.580
a lot of kids with both autism and bowel disorders,

07:49.580 --> 07:52.340
and he launched the study to investigate a possible link.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.340
Ah!

07:53.340 --> 07:55.160
But what does all that have to do with vaccines?

07:55.160 --> 07:57.200
I mean, surely it must have found something

07:57.200 --> 07:59.300
for it to have caused all this controversy.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.040
Well, allow me to list the paper's

08:01.040 --> 08:03.880
highly scientific findings.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.800
Some of the parents of the children in the study

08:06.800 --> 08:10.260
think they remember the autism symptoms

08:10.260 --> 08:14.500
starting after the MMR vaccine.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.920
No, really, that's it.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.880
Findings.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.960
Onset of behavioral symptoms was associated by the parents

08:19.960 --> 08:22.580
with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.580
For literally decades, right,

08:24.580 --> 08:26.380
I've been hearing about this paper,

08:26.380 --> 08:29.120
and I've assumed that there must have been something there,

08:29.120 --> 08:32.760

08:32.760 --> 08:35.120
Everyone lost their fucking minds over it,

so surely there's something, and I finally go and read it,

08:38.660 --> 08:41.580

08:50.620 --> 08:53.160
and the stuff the parents think they remember

08:53.160 --> 08:55.120

08:55.120 --> 08:57.620
Like, next to colonoscopies and biopsies

He received a dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine,

09:05.100 --> 09:06.820
the day after which his mother described

09:06.820 --> 09:09.020
a striking deterioration in his behavior

09:09.020 --> 09:11.440
that she did link with the immunization.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.560
A note from your mother isn't science.

There. Perfect.

No, Rachel, don't wave the camera.

That's not how people communicate.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.940
Page three of the study provides a table

09:56.940 --> 09:59.440
listing each child's behavioral diagnosis,

09:59.440 --> 10:02.100
largely autism, and also what their parents identified

10:02.100 --> 10:03.440
as their exposure,

10:03.440 --> 10:05.600
the thing which, in their opinion,

10:05.600 --> 10:07.180
caused the diagnosis.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.260
Of course, most of them blame the vaccine.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.020
Now, while a bunch of opinions

10:11.020 --> 10:14.760
are about as useful in science as a bath made of teeth,

10:14.760 --> 10:16.600
we might as well explore how someone

10:16.600 --> 10:18.440
might end up having that opinion.

It's actually really common for us to...

Okay. Why?

10:28.620 --> 10:29.960
I will not explain why.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.740
It's actually really common for us to assume

10:31.740 --> 10:33.920
two things that happened to us around the same time

10:33.920 --> 10:35.420
must be caused by one another.

10:35.420 --> 10:38.540
That's how we as ape people whose fur fell off one day

10:40.120 --> 10:42.000
godless little monkey brains.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.040
If you ate some strange new berries

10:44.040 --> 10:45.340
and got sick that day,

10:45.340 --> 10:47.700
you're basically programmed to connect the two

10:47.700 --> 10:49.160
for the sake of your own survival.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.620
This is the one in ten times

that evolutionary psychology is real.

It might not have been the berries.

It could have been all the budget energy drinks

You know what? Maybe you can have too much carabao.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.460
Another big problem here is how humans

11:07.460 --> 11:09.280
relate to spans of time,

11:09.280 --> 11:10.780

11:13.040 --> 11:14.860
because nothing happens anymore.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.540
If someone coughs on you today

11:16.540 --> 11:19.000
and later in the evening you start to feel a bit sick,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.120
a lot of people might remember being coughed on

11:21.120 --> 11:22.580
and assume that's how they got it,

11:22.580 --> 11:25.440
but illnesses can take days or weeks to incubate.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.740
Maybe you don't remember the time you got coughed on

11:27.740 --> 11:29.620
two weeks ago by the guy who was delivering

11:29.620 --> 11:31.160

11:36.960 --> 11:38.040
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

11:38.040 --> 11:39.960
The table claims some of the parents

11:39.960 --> 11:42.200
noticed the symptoms a few weeks, days,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.820
or even hours after getting the vaccine,

11:44.820 --> 11:46.500
but I do have to wonder how easy it is

11:46.500 --> 11:48.660
for someone to recall something as complex

11:48.660 --> 11:50.900
as the exact date of the onset

11:50.900 --> 11:53.100
of a child's behavioral symptoms.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.100
A BBC documentary from back in the day

11:55.100 --> 11:57.360
interviewed a parent and they said on camera

11:57.360 --> 12:00.860
that their son became autistic overnight after the vaccine.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.280
What happened to your other son?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.780
Overnight. He had the fever, the high temperature.

12:04.780 --> 12:06.820
Literally overnight. He was never the same again.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.280
Even the interviewer was like,

12:08.280 --> 12:10.480
literally? Literally overnight?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.900
Like, are you sure?

12:11.900 --> 12:13.820
The signs of autism appear gradually

12:13.820 --> 12:15.280
and grow over time.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.020
When parents first take notice,

12:17.020 --> 12:19.360
there could easily be other signs they missed.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.320
Another better documentary about all this

12:21.320 --> 12:23.440
we'll get to later actually found parents

12:23.440 --> 12:26.200
who realized they'd made this exact mistake.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.240
Stacey and Damien no longer believe

12:28.240 --> 12:30.780
that their daughter's autism was caused by MMR.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.620
After researching and remembering Rebecca as a baby,

12:33.620 --> 12:36.080
they realized that she had already shown symptoms

12:36.080 --> 12:37.700
before she was vaccinated.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.000
Parents don't necessarily notice the symptoms

12:40.000 --> 12:41.360
until they're fairly obvious,

12:41.360 --> 12:43.580
but that doesn't mean the symptoms weren't there

12:43.580 --> 12:46.000
or their child wasn't autistic beforehand.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.740
I'm bringing this up because it's important

12:47.740 --> 12:50.160
to make the distinction that whenever someone describes

12:50.160 --> 12:52.380
something like their child's first symptom,

12:52.380 --> 12:55.040
what they are really describing is the first symptom

12:55.040 --> 12:56.740
they personally noticed.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.460
Here's a timeline of the first two years

12:58.460 --> 12:59.620
of a child's development.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.120
Statistically, the average age

13:01.120 --> 13:03.780
that symptoms of autism become noticeable to parents

13:03.780 --> 13:05.920
is around 12 to 18 months.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.540
Children in the UK receive a dose of the MMR vaccine

13:08.540 --> 13:10.700
from between 12 to 15 months.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.580
Isn't it possible that these parents

13:12.580 --> 13:14.660
are blaming a coincidental event?

13:14.660 --> 13:17.460
You can even see evidence that this happens in the paper

13:17.460 --> 13:18.880
because some of the other parents

13:18.880 --> 13:21.560
blame other totally coincidental events.

13:21.560 --> 13:25.020
One of them blames their child's autism on an ear infection

13:25.020 --> 13:28.220
they got a week before they first noticed the symptoms.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.020
Do ear infections cause autism now?

13:31.020 --> 13:32.440
No.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.980
No. Of course not,

13:33.980 --> 13:35.720
but if it was the only other thing

13:35.720 --> 13:37.600
that you remembered happening to your child,

13:37.600 --> 13:38.980
you can see how someone might end up

13:38.980 --> 13:40.240
assuming they're related.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.900
Before this study was released,

13:41.900 --> 13:44.500
there were a few very small clusters of parents

13:44.500 --> 13:47.500
that thought vaccines caused autism or other illnesses.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.040
JABS, the Justice, Awareness, and Basic Support Group,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.540
wow, they really worked hard to make their name say JABS,

13:53.540 --> 13:55.720
had been around for a few years beforehand.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.680
The founder of JABS, Jackie Fletcher,

13:57.680 --> 13:59.460
asserts to this day that her son

13:59.460 --> 14:01.560
suddenly became severely autistic

14:01.560 --> 14:03.800
ten days after his MMR vaccination

14:03.800 --> 14:05.880
and has frequently tried to sue the government

14:05.880 --> 14:08.380
and MMR manufacturers for money over it.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.800
It's important to recognize that statistically,

14:10.800 --> 14:13.140
even if vaccines are perfectly safe,

14:13.160 --> 14:15.860
you're going to get a small amount of parents like her

14:15.860 --> 14:17.880
who are convinced that vaccines are harmful

14:17.880 --> 14:19.540
because they got one right before

14:19.540 --> 14:20.920
something like this happened.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.760
Before there was a scientific paper

14:22.760 --> 14:25.460
and thousands of news pieces telling them to,

14:25.460 --> 14:27.460
there really weren't that many parents

14:27.460 --> 14:29.720
of autistic children who blamed the vaccine.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.880
According to a pro-JABS piece made in May 2002

14:32.880 --> 14:34.020
when the scare was happening,

14:34.020 --> 14:35.440
there were thousands of members,

14:35.440 --> 14:37.140
but before all that, there were only about

14:37.140 --> 14:39.060
30 sets of parents at best,

14:39.060 --> 14:40.780
and speaking of groups being too small

14:40.780 --> 14:42.280
to be statistically meaningful,

14:42.300 --> 14:44.380
another big problem, or to put it another way,

14:44.380 --> 14:46.760
a small problem, is sample size.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.920
Ha ha ha, please hold your applause until the end.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.420
On its own, a study of a small sample size

14:51.420 --> 14:53.800
like 12 children can't prove anything

14:53.800 --> 14:55.600
about the rest of a population.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.220
I've made this point about people drawing

14:57.220 --> 14:59.840
sweeping conclusions from small studies before.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.640
However, it's important to understand

15:01.640 --> 15:04.100
sample size criticisms in the proper context.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.900
Studies on small groups happen all the time in science

15:06.900 --> 15:07.780
for a good reason.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.700
They're often called pilot studies,

15:09.700 --> 15:11.060
and they're useful for figuring out

15:11.060 --> 15:12.640
how a bigger study should work

15:12.640 --> 15:14.180
in preparation for the real thing

15:14.180 --> 15:15.900
or for checking to see if there's something

15:15.900 --> 15:17.720
worth looking into in the first place.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.140
A fraction of parents of the tens of millions

15:20.140 --> 15:21.560
of children who've had this vaccine

15:21.560 --> 15:23.740
saying they think there might be a connection

15:23.740 --> 15:26.780
is at best grounds to do a better study

15:26.780 --> 15:28.820
on a bigger group of children to find out

15:28.820 --> 15:31.120
if this connection actually exists.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.860
We're going to come back to this later

15:32.860 --> 15:34.780
because someone had the opportunity

15:34.780 --> 15:35.960
to do one of those,

15:35.960 --> 15:37.820
and what they did with that opportunity

15:37.820 --> 15:39.960
is very interesting.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.480
That was an awful take. Let me do that again.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.780
In summary, the science is really bad.

15:44.780 --> 15:45.900
It's bonkers.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.280
The study even admits it doesn't prove anything at the end.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.700
We did not prove an association

15:50.700 --> 15:52.920
between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine

15:52.920 --> 15:54.580
and the syndrome described.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.300
The next sentence is hilarious.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.040
Virological studies are underway

15:58.040 --> 16:00.000
that may help to resolve this issue.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.760
The issue being that they don't have any proof.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.540
In science, it's expected to admit

16:04.540 --> 16:05.960
the limitations of your study.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.180
Papers and medical journals have high standards

16:08.200 --> 16:10.440
for what constitutes solid proof.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.060
However, Wakefield is using this as a shield.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.620
By hiding behind the defense

16:14.620 --> 16:16.660
that he hasn't claimed to prove anything,

16:16.660 --> 16:18.820
he can then speculate about a lot of things

16:18.820 --> 16:20.240
he hasn't proved.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.000
For example, these children appear to share similar,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.240
though nonspecific, bowel problems.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.580
I say appeared because, well, we'll come back to that,

16:27.580 --> 16:30.000
but Wakefield takes this vague collection

16:30.000 --> 16:32.340
of similar things and concludes with the theory

16:32.340 --> 16:33.720
that could make his career,

16:33.720 --> 16:35.840
that the vaccine may cause autism

16:35.840 --> 16:38.060
and it happens through the bowels.

16:38.060 --> 16:40.600
We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children

16:40.600 --> 16:43.480
that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.180
In most cases, onset of symptoms

16:45.180 --> 16:48.060
was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunization.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.700
Further investigations are needed to examine the syndrome

16:50.700 --> 16:53.280
and its possible relation to this vaccine.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.160
In literally the final sentences of the paper,

16:56.160 --> 16:58.320
Wakefield invents a new disease

16:58.320 --> 17:00.860
that combines bowel disorders and autism

17:00.860 --> 17:03.660
and then speculates that MMR vaccination

17:03.660 --> 17:06.840
might cause the disease he just made up.

17:06.860 --> 17:10.360
This is absolutely buck wild, as some would put it.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.040
It's like medical fan fiction.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.700
Sure, he admitted it just may be

17:15.700 --> 17:18.580
and said we need more research to prove anything,

17:18.580 --> 17:21.120
but now his made-up disease

17:21.120 --> 17:23.420
is in a published scientific paper

17:23.420 --> 17:25.460
in one of the most prestigious medical journals

17:25.460 --> 17:26.380
in the world.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.800
Journalists with little to no scientific knowledge

17:28.800 --> 17:30.560
go on to report on this paper

17:30.560 --> 17:33.060
as if it's discovering this new disease.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.680
Doctors at the Royal Free Hospital

17:34.680 --> 17:36.480
believe they may have discovered a link

17:36.500 --> 17:38.240
between the combination vaccine

17:38.240 --> 17:40.780
and a bowel disease that can progress to autism.

17:40.780 --> 17:41.880
What are you talking about?

17:41.880 --> 17:43.380
He admitted he didn't prove anything

17:43.380 --> 17:45.420
and then wildly speculated at the end.

17:45.420 --> 17:45.920
No!

17:45.920 --> 17:48.220
There is one last really weird thing

17:48.220 --> 17:50.000
about this paper we haven't mentioned yet,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.060
which most people don't seem to mention,

17:52.060 --> 17:53.600
which I find a little bit weird

17:53.600 --> 17:55.840
and indicates that no one has actually read it.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.940
Towards the end of the paper,

17:57.940 --> 18:00.640
ugh, Wakefield tries to find other papers

18:00.640 --> 18:02.560
that kind of support his findings,

18:02.560 --> 18:05.320
so he really has to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.480
Fudenberg noted that for 15 of 20 autistic children,

18:08.480 --> 18:11.800
the first symptoms developed within a week of vaccination.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.720
Wow!

18:12.720 --> 18:14.720
That's a really interesting thing to...

18:14.720 --> 18:15.960
urk, isn't it?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.240
We should probably actually go read Fudenberg's paper

18:18.240 --> 18:20.240
and see what it has to say for itself.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.160
Fudenberg's 1996 paper cited here is from

18:26.160 --> 18:29.080
Biotherapy, a fringe journal for quacks

18:29.080 --> 18:31.720
that actually went out of business two years later.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.640
The paper is a pilot study on the effects

18:33.640 --> 18:35.000
of a substance called

18:35.000 --> 18:38.640
dialysable lymphocyte extract on children with autism.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.040
In addition to alleging that several of the children

18:41.040 --> 18:43.840
had become autistic within a week of getting vaccinated,

18:43.840 --> 18:45.040
are you ready for this?

18:45.040 --> 18:48.240
Fudenberg claimed that this extract he'd created

18:48.240 --> 18:50.480
could cure autism.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.600
Of the 22 with classic autism,

18:52.600 --> 18:55.800
10 became normal in that they were mainstreamed in school

18:55.800 --> 18:58.600
and clinical characteristics were fully normalized.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.720
Became normal!

19:00.720 --> 19:02.080
Holy shit!

19:02.120 --> 19:04.400
And you want to know something funny?

19:04.400 --> 19:06.520
You want to know something funny?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.920
At the time that the study was published,

19:08.920 --> 19:12.040
Fudenberg didn't have a medical license.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.280
It was revoked the year before

19:14.280 --> 19:17.120
because he was caught stealing controlled substances

19:17.120 --> 19:19.440
from his job for personal use.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.840
The South Carolina Medical Board found him guilty

19:21.840 --> 19:24.320
of engaging in dishonorable, unethical,

19:24.320 --> 19:26.040
or unprofessional conduct.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.360
He admitted he'd done it in the hearing too.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.400
So he got caught stealing drugs,

19:30.400 --> 19:33.640
admitted it, got fired, lost all credibility,

19:33.640 --> 19:35.640
probably wasn't even allowed within 100 yards

19:35.640 --> 19:38.360
of a stethoscope, and then a year later,

19:38.360 --> 19:41.240
he cured autism, according to him.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.920
And you know he's trustworthy because he admitted

19:43.920 --> 19:45.880
to stealing all those medical supplies.

19:45.880 --> 19:50.160
What I'm trying to say here is ex-Dr. Hugh Fudenberg's paper

19:50.160 --> 19:54.120
is one of the most obviously bullshit things I've ever read.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.000
And Wakefield had to cite it

19:56.000 --> 19:58.440
to create a precedent for his findings.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.480
This is the best he could get.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.880
You can see why it's a bit weird

20:01.880 --> 20:03.280
no one brings this up, right?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.840
In scientific circles,

20:04.840 --> 20:06.960
everyone who read Wakefield's paper,

20:06.960 --> 20:10.360
or worse, bothered to check the sources it cited,

20:10.360 --> 20:13.080
had, you know, a few minor concerns.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.960
It was so concerning that The Lancet published

20:15.960 --> 20:19.400
in the same issue a response to the paper.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.200
Vaccine adverse events, causal or coincidental.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.080
It points out numerous problems,

20:25.080 --> 20:27.000
some of which we've discussed here already,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.520
and has some words to say about fear-mongering

20:29.520 --> 20:31.200
about vaccines like this.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.680
Vaccine safety concerns,

20:32.680 --> 20:34.920
such as that reported by Wakefield and colleagues,

20:34.920 --> 20:37.200
may snowball into societal tragedies

20:37.200 --> 20:40.640
when the media and the public confuse association

20:40.640 --> 20:43.680
with causality and shun immunization.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.720
This would be tragic because passion

20:45.720 --> 20:49.280
would then conquer reason and the facts again in the UK.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.400
This commentary would probably have seemed

20:51.400 --> 20:54.160
darkly apocalyptic at the time,

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
but in retrospect,

20:55.200 --> 20:57.560
it was a shockingly accurate prediction.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.680
Like, they knew!

20:58.680 --> 21:00.200
They fucking warned us!

21:00.200 --> 21:02.920
So even before the paper was in the public eye,

21:02.920 --> 21:05.560
other doctors and scientists were looking at it

21:05.560 --> 21:07.920
and saying, this ain't it, chief.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.640
Is that still a current reference?

21:09.640 --> 21:12.040
I've aged 10 years in the last two weeks.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.160
Time is meaningless.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.600
But despite a lot of obvious concerns

21:15.600 --> 21:16.960
and clear weaknesses,

21:16.960 --> 21:19.400
Wakefield published the study anyway,

21:19.400 --> 21:21.080
and then, and this is weird,

21:21.080 --> 21:24.040
he immediately held a press conference about it.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.280
This isn't something that anyone normally does in science,

21:27.280 --> 21:30.280
especially not after publishing a five-page study

21:30.280 --> 21:32.160
that admits it didn't prove anything.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.440
The paper was so small and its findings so insignificant

21:35.440 --> 21:37.480
that it barely even qualifies as a paper.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.200
In fact, it was published in the Lancet as an early report.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.520
See, the top left corner?

21:42.520 --> 21:43.520
Zoom in on it.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.520
It's there.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.400
You gotta be quicker on the drill than that.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.960
Holding a press conference for this

21:48.960 --> 21:50.640
is something you do if you want attention

21:50.640 --> 21:52.400
for your controversial paper,

21:52.400 --> 21:54.160
not if you're trying to do science,

21:54.160 --> 21:56.600
and here's where the whole thing really started.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.920
During the press conference,

21:57.920 --> 22:00.480
Wakefield pretended his study had discovered

22:00.480 --> 22:02.000
a risk so earth-shaking

22:02.000 --> 22:04.880
that the government should stop using the MMR vaccine

22:04.880 --> 22:06.640
and replace it with measles, mumps,

22:06.640 --> 22:09.000
and rubella vaccines given separately.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.960
One more case of this is too many.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.400
We put children at no greater risk

22:13.400 --> 22:17.240
if we dissociate those vaccines into three,

22:17.240 --> 22:20.640
but we may be averting the possibility of this problem.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.800
This is the moment that changed everything.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.240
Wakefield told a room full of reporters

22:25.240 --> 22:26.520
that based on his study,

22:26.520 --> 22:29.160
he felt the MMR vaccine could be putting millions

22:29.160 --> 22:30.400
of children at risk.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.080
The mainstream media were in love with the notion

22:33.080 --> 22:34.800
that the paper had found something,

22:34.800 --> 22:37.840
so they ran with it all the way into hell.

22:37.840 --> 22:43.320
♪♪

22:43.320 --> 22:44.720
The paper was bad, sure,

22:44.720 --> 22:46.560
but mass movements against vaccines

22:46.560 --> 22:48.640
don't start because of the release of a paper.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.640
Like we discussed, people don't read papers.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.640
I didn't read it for, like, 20 years,

22:52.640 --> 22:54.240
and you know who else didn't read it?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.080
Every journalist who reported on it,

22:56.080 --> 22:58.080
but when a doctor publicly says

22:58.080 --> 23:00.640
the government is putting millions of children at risk

23:00.640 --> 23:02.840
with a vaccine rolled out nationwide,

23:02.840 --> 23:04.720
even if his paper's a load of old shit,

23:04.720 --> 23:06.000
you gotta report on that.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
The possibility was too tantalizing to ignore.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.240
It's really hard to get across how unavoidable

23:11.240 --> 23:12.240
the issue was.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.760
If you even glanced at a TV or a newspaper

23:14.760 --> 23:15.960
in the mid-2000s,

23:15.960 --> 23:18.000
it was MMR might cause autism

23:18.000 --> 23:20.920
or it was Princess Diana is Still Dead.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.040
Measles kills thousands of people every year,

23:24.040 --> 23:27.240
but today, questions about the vaccine.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.360
Vaccination could be linked to a new side effect,

23:30.360 --> 23:32.920
a combination of bowel disease and autism.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.040
Hundreds of articles, news pieces,

23:35.040 --> 23:36.440
and documentaries were made

23:36.440 --> 23:39.040
about the potential significance of this study.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.000
They rarely show or discuss the contents

23:41.000 --> 23:42.120
of the paper itself,

23:42.120 --> 23:44.680
but the doctor behind it came out against MMR.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.000
There's a potential link.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.600
There's a potential link, everybody.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.560
And do you know what happens when every news resource

23:50.560 --> 23:53.840
is screaming about the potential risks of a vaccine?

23:53.840 --> 23:56.480
You make millions of people terrified

23:56.480 --> 23:58.080
to vaccinate their children.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.920
I was growing up during the MMR scare,

23:59.920 --> 24:01.800
and the main thing I remember from the TV news

24:01.800 --> 24:04.880
at that time was big shots of pointy needles

24:04.880 --> 24:07.760
and children screaming as they get given an injection

24:07.760 --> 24:09.600
and ominous voiceovers saying,

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
oh, these vaccines might be dangerous.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.080
It's almost like TV deliberately scares people

24:14.080 --> 24:15.720
for ratings because that's how this works.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.720
That's the entire point.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.440
If you want to know why thousands of parents

24:18.440 --> 24:20.640
think MMR gave their children autism,

24:20.640 --> 24:23.120
it's not because they came to that conclusion on their own.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.680
We've seen how before all of this reporting happened,

24:25.680 --> 24:28.080
only a teeny tiny minority of parents

24:28.080 --> 24:30.520
made the connection between autism and the vaccine.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.320
They could only find seven parents of autistic children

24:33.320 --> 24:35.920
who blamed MMR in the original study even.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.720
The only thing that changed was how many news outlets

24:38.720 --> 24:41.160
were telling everyone the vaccine might cause it.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.000
After years of the media telling them

24:43.000 --> 24:44.080
it could have been the jab,

24:44.080 --> 24:46.480
some parents started to believe it.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.120
The symptoms started to appear when he was two,

24:49.120 --> 24:51.960
soon after he had his MMR.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.520
This is the age at which autism usually develops,

24:54.520 --> 24:57.160
but his parents don't believe it's coincidence.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.280
His parents didn't believe it was a coincidence

24:59.280 --> 25:01.360
because every news resource was telling them

25:01.360 --> 25:03.400
it might have something to do with the vaccine,

25:03.400 --> 25:05.960
and trusting that the media had done the work

25:05.960 --> 25:07.800
and knew what they were talking about,

25:07.800 --> 25:10.000
they believed what they were being told.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.320
The end result of publications and broadcasts like this

25:13.320 --> 25:16.080
was a lot of concerned parents,

25:16.080 --> 25:18.280
a lot of unvaccinated children,

25:18.280 --> 25:21.280
and a whole lot of new cases of measles.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.200
With inoculation rates falling to dangerous levels.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.240
In Ireland, the debate over MMR has been fueled

25:27.240 --> 25:29.480
still further by a measles outbreak

25:29.480 --> 25:31.280
which killed three children.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.760
Whatever the official evidence,

25:32.760 --> 25:35.640
which rejected a link between MMR and autism,

25:35.640 --> 25:38.200
fewer parents were prepared to take a risk.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.680
I wonder why that might be.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.840
Could it be because every time you turned on the television,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.400
there's footage of a screaming child

25:43.400 --> 25:44.520
with a needle in its arm?

25:44.520 --> 25:47.360
Once literally every other doctor had come out saying,

25:47.360 --> 25:49.600
look, there's no proof. Please stop doing this,

25:49.600 --> 25:52.000
a lot of journalists got really defensive suddenly

25:52.000 --> 25:53.480
and started putting out pieces like,

25:53.480 --> 25:56.560
no, I will not stop reporting scaremongering bullshit.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.840
Wait, the same journalist wrote both of these.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.760
She just spent like six months of her career

26:00.760 --> 26:02.760
complaining about people criticizing her.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.400
Amazing.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.240
So what was Andrew Wakefield doing during all this?

26:06.240 --> 26:08.400
Well, he was getting interviewed nonstop

26:08.400 --> 26:11.240
and having clips played in almost all of these news pieces.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.480
He was like a celebrity,

26:12.480 --> 26:14.440
especially to the growing list of parents

26:14.440 --> 26:16.520
newly convinced by the media's reporting

26:16.520 --> 26:19.160
that he'd discovered why their children had autism.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.000
For a couple of years, Andrew Wakefield

26:21.000 --> 26:23.560
was the sort of guy who you filmed in slow motion

26:23.560 --> 26:25.360
in black and white.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.240
Holy shi-

26:26.240 --> 26:28.280
Wakefield used his time in the spotlight

26:28.280 --> 26:30.240
to spread even more doubt about MMR

26:30.240 --> 26:32.360
and continue to repeat the recommendation

26:32.360 --> 26:34.920
that parents get separate vaccines instead.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.400
At the press conference, in interviews in the aftermath,

26:37.400 --> 26:40.400
and four whole times on a 23-minute videotape

26:40.400 --> 26:41.520
he sent to journalists,

26:41.560 --> 26:43.440
he claims he thinks separate vaccines

26:43.440 --> 26:45.160
would avoid the risk of autism.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.920
Andrew Wakefield says he appealed

26:46.920 --> 26:49.360
to the chief medical officer more than six months ago

26:49.360 --> 26:51.880
to give worried parents the option of the single vaccine.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.520
My recommendation has been

26:53.520 --> 26:55.560
that children should continue to be vaccinated,

26:55.560 --> 26:56.800
but to separate the vaccines,

26:56.800 --> 26:58.680
there is sufficient anxiety in my own mind

26:58.680 --> 27:01.680
over the safety, the long-term safety of the polyvalent,

27:01.680 --> 27:04.840
that is the MMR vaccination in combination,

27:04.840 --> 27:06.600
that I think that it should be suspended

27:06.600 --> 27:09.040
in favor of the single vaccines.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.120
There is sufficient anxiety in my own mind

27:12.120 --> 27:15.200
that it would be sensible to divide them

27:15.200 --> 27:16.880
into separate doses.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.040
There is sufficient anxiety

27:19.040 --> 27:21.440
that the parents must have a choice

27:21.440 --> 27:22.480
of how they protect their children.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.680
It's really kind of interesting

27:23.680 --> 27:26.200
that while the modern anti-vaccine movement

27:26.200 --> 27:29.280
insists that all vaccines are dangerous in some way,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.600
the guy who started the fear and anxiety

27:31.600 --> 27:33.640
that led to this was pro-vaccine.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.560
We advocate vaccination.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.360
This is not anti-vaccine in any way.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.440
He was really specific about the fact

27:39.440 --> 27:41.800
that he thought parents should keep vaccinating,

27:41.800 --> 27:44.280
just that they should use alternatives to MMR.

27:44.280 --> 27:47.600
The single vaccines are likely in this context

27:47.600 --> 27:48.280
to be safer.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.320
Remember that disease he speculated about

27:50.320 --> 27:51.480
at the end of his paper?

27:51.480 --> 27:53.760
That there might be some kind of bowel disorder

27:53.760 --> 27:56.680
caused by MMR that then leads to autism?

27:56.680 --> 27:58.640
This came up in the media a lot as well.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.800
Could the NMR jab be causing a strange,

28:01.800 --> 28:03.880
new kind of bowel disease

28:03.880 --> 28:06.160
that was turning the children autistic?

28:06.160 --> 28:08.840
Measles, mumps, and rubella given together

28:08.840 --> 28:10.240
may be too much for the immune system

28:10.240 --> 28:11.400
of some children to handle.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.960
There is a bowel disease, a new syndrome

28:13.960 --> 28:16.520
associated with regressive autism,

28:16.520 --> 28:18.200
and that that may be related to MMR.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.680
Eventually, he even came up with a name for it.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.840
Autistic enterocolitis.

28:22.840 --> 28:25.320
Wakefield's theory, when he tries to explain it,

28:25.320 --> 28:27.760
is that the almost-dead measles virus

28:27.760 --> 28:29.280
present in the MMR vaccine

28:29.280 --> 28:32.320
can get stuck in the intestine...somehow,

28:32.320 --> 28:33.760
causing all that inflammation

28:33.760 --> 28:35.600
they apparently found in the study.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.880
More on that later.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.360
Which leads to it not digesting certain foods

28:39.360 --> 28:41.200
like bread and milk properly,

28:41.200 --> 28:43.200
turning them into, his words,

28:43.200 --> 28:45.240
a morphine-like substance

28:45.240 --> 28:47.400
which then leaks out of the bowel

28:47.400 --> 28:50.080
and into the brain, causing autism.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.080
Morphine-like substances from the gut

28:52.080 --> 28:54.080
that you and I produce in our diet

28:54.080 --> 28:55.920
from milk and wheat

28:55.920 --> 28:59.320
are actually getting access through that leaky gut

28:59.320 --> 29:01.320
into the developing brain.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.720
This theory is, uh, very strange.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.760
One of the many strange things about it

29:06.760 --> 29:08.480
is that it specifically implicates

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
the measles part of the vaccine.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.520
If measles, when it's in a vaccine,

29:12.520 --> 29:14.840
can cause a syndrome that leads to autism,

29:14.840 --> 29:17.080
how could you possibly be so certain

29:17.080 --> 29:19.760
that the separate vaccine for measles would be safe?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.320
The risk of this particular syndrome developing

29:22.320 --> 29:24.680
is related to the combined vaccine,

29:24.680 --> 29:27.680
the MMR, rather than the single vaccines.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.120
Okay, sure, but why?

29:29.120 --> 29:31.560
On what basis are you saying that, Andy?

29:31.560 --> 29:34.360
How could a doctor so easily make that recommendation?

29:34.440 --> 29:38.360
And it may be that giving the measles on its own

29:38.360 --> 29:41.680
reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.080
He just keeps saying it.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.120
My opinion, again,

29:45.120 --> 29:48.640
is that the monovalent, the single vaccines,

29:48.640 --> 29:50.000
measles, mumps, and rubella,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.040
are likely in this context to be safer

29:53.040 --> 29:54.800
than the polyvalent vaccine.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.440
That's the MMR vaccine.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.760
There's actually a real reason

29:58.760 --> 30:01.040
why he recommended the separate vaccine so much.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.360
Uh, we'll get to that later.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.040
Here's the one example I could find

30:04.040 --> 30:06.400
of an interviewer asking him to explain themself.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.640
But even supposing the measles element of the MMR vaccine

30:10.640 --> 30:14.600
had deposited the virus in the intestinal tissue

30:14.600 --> 30:16.760
of these children,

30:16.760 --> 30:20.800
a single jab of measles might do the same.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.640
Theoretically, it might.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.720
But you're advocating a jab,

30:24.720 --> 30:26.000
single jabs instead of MMR?

30:26.000 --> 30:26.920
I said theoretically.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.240
Oh, only theoretically.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.880
Well, that's fine, then.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.240
What a great scientist.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.160
But if you say it may do,

30:33.200 --> 30:35.520
then how can you advocate a single jab of measles,

30:35.520 --> 30:37.720
even if there's only a theoretical possibility

30:37.720 --> 30:40.120
that it might damage a child?

30:40.120 --> 30:41.720
While that question mark exists,

30:41.720 --> 30:43.040
at the very least,

30:43.040 --> 30:46.080
parents deserve a choice of how they protect their children

30:46.080 --> 30:47.240
against these infections,

30:47.240 --> 30:49.480
whether it be with the MMR vaccine

30:49.480 --> 30:51.080
or whether it is with the single vaccine.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.680
He always finds a way to pivot back

30:52.680 --> 30:56.120
to how in the midst of all of these questions and concerns,

30:56.120 --> 30:57.120
which he started,

30:57.120 --> 30:58.760
parents should at least have the option

30:58.760 --> 31:00.040
of a separate vaccine.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.280
Honestly, you'd think he was some kind of salesman

31:02.280 --> 31:03.680
for alternative vaccines.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.560
Autistic enterocolitis is not

31:05.560 --> 31:08.760
and has never been accepted as real by gastroenterology,

31:08.760 --> 31:11.280
the field specializing in the stomach and intestines,

31:11.280 --> 31:14.680
but an ordinary person, or worse, a journalist,

31:14.680 --> 31:16.160
might not understand it enough

31:16.160 --> 31:17.800
to know that it doesn't make sense.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.800
So, of course, it got reported as an interesting new idea.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.760
It was a bold and controversial theory.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.520
That's an interesting choice of words.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.440
This piece by that really defensive lady,

31:28.440 --> 31:31.120
Melanie Phillips, one of the most well-paid journalists

31:31.120 --> 31:33.680
in Britain at the time, is still continuing to spread it

31:33.680 --> 31:36.800
in this very article about being criticized for spreading it.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.760
She calls it a unique gut-brain disease.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.640
When you imagine a new disease,

31:41.640 --> 31:43.680
of course it's gonna sound unique, Melanie.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.720
No red flags popping up around the fact

31:45.720 --> 31:48.360
that no disease has ever functioned like this before?

31:48.360 --> 31:49.720
No? Fucking hell.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.720
This completely unproved, unique, bold,

31:52.720 --> 31:56.480
and controversial theory was irresistible to Phillips,

31:56.480 --> 31:58.720
a bigot of the year award-winning writer

31:58.720 --> 32:00.880
famous for also denying climate change,

32:00.880 --> 32:02.540
calling Obama an Islamist,

32:02.540 --> 32:07.000
describing a group of liberal Jews as Jews for genocide,

32:07.000 --> 32:10.340
and opposing both Irish independence and gay rights,

32:10.340 --> 32:13.140
which she dismissed as an attack on the traditional family

32:13.140 --> 32:14.800
by cultural Marxism.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.680
It's not shocking that Phillips was wrong about MMR.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.520
It's her job to be wrong about everything.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.220
The truly shocking thing about this is that for once,

32:22.220 --> 32:24.440
the entire rest of the British media

32:24.440 --> 32:26.060
were on the same side as her,

32:26.060 --> 32:29.320
uncritically regurgitating everything Wakefield said

32:29.320 --> 32:30.700
to millions of people.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.360
This completely irresponsible reporting

32:33.360 --> 32:35.780
caused fear, vaccine hesitancy,

32:35.780 --> 32:37.900
kick-started an anti-vaccine movement

32:37.900 --> 32:39.400
that's still here today,

32:39.400 --> 32:42.020
and resulted in the deaths of children

32:42.020 --> 32:44.780
from completely preventable diseases.

32:44.780 --> 32:46.900
And that's the tea, sis.

32:46.900 --> 32:51.040
There's real liquid in there. I'm not doing a bit.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.040
I will spill it if I try and show it to you.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.040
I'm sorry, but there's, look.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.660
See? It's real.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.880
It's not tea, though. It's coffee.

32:58.940 --> 32:59.940
I'm not a farmer.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.900
Perhaps the only thing more frustrating

33:04.900 --> 33:07.240
than seeing the media do everything it can

33:07.240 --> 33:08.820
to push pseudoscience

33:08.820 --> 33:12.040
was how everyone actually addressed the topic of autism.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.080
Autism is a complex condition

33:14.080 --> 33:16.000
we still don't fully understand,

33:16.000 --> 33:19.380
with many variations in symptoms and severity,

33:19.380 --> 33:21.380
but the media never mentioned that.

33:21.380 --> 33:23.760
They deliberately went looking for the most severe

33:23.760 --> 33:26.220
and extreme cases they could find

33:26.220 --> 33:29.060
and then filmed them to exploit for television.

33:29.060 --> 33:31.360
Children who couldn't communicate verbally

33:31.360 --> 33:34.020
or had severe physical disabilities as well.

33:34.020 --> 33:37.100
The intent to make the MMR question

33:37.100 --> 33:38.980
as serious as possible

33:38.980 --> 33:42.200
resulted in an almost pornographic obsession

33:42.200 --> 33:43.620
with suffering children.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.700
They went out of their way to portray autism

33:45.700 --> 33:47.700
as a horrific tragedy

33:47.700 --> 33:50.120
that it's worth risking a disease to avoid.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.920
And yeah, measles is a disease.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.840
Like, it kills people.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.200
It can cause incredibly severe complications

33:57.200 --> 33:58.500
that are with people for life.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.580
We as a society are no longer really aware

34:00.580 --> 34:02.580
of just how dangerous measles can be

34:02.580 --> 34:05.140
because we don't see all those complications

34:05.140 --> 34:07.040
as much because of vaccinations.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.600
Measles, mumps, and rubella are legitimately dangerous

34:09.600 --> 34:12.480
and potentially life-threatening diseases,

34:12.480 --> 34:16.440
and it says a lot about how we think about neurodivergence

34:16.440 --> 34:18.740
that it's worth risking that

34:18.740 --> 34:20.980
to avoid being autistic to some people.

34:20.980 --> 34:23.020
Hell, I was in Waitrose a few months ago.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.500
I never shop there, but I pretend to

34:25.500 --> 34:28.500
so I can use their unnecessarily massive parking space,

34:28.500 --> 34:29.920
and I saw them selling a magazine

34:29.920 --> 34:31.500
with this on the cover.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.260
Reignite your child's brain

34:34.260 --> 34:36.840
with alternative treatments.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.720
What they mean there is alternatives to treatment.

34:39.720 --> 34:42.060
This is not how a healthy society

34:42.060 --> 34:43.260
discusses its people.

34:43.260 --> 34:45.060
Autistic people have to navigate a world

34:45.060 --> 34:47.480
that refuses to accommodate them in the slightest

34:47.480 --> 34:49.440
to the point they're regularly confronted

34:49.440 --> 34:52.940
with the idea other people think their brain has gone out.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.500
Come on, get it together, Waitrose.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.000
You're the up-market, upper-class,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.320
rich people supermarket.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.700
You're supposed to be the smartest.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.000
What's going on there?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.580
The only thing that needs igniting here

35:04.580 --> 35:07.180
is your fucking shops.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.340
Did we get clearance to say that?

35:10.340 --> 35:11.340
Okay, that was a joke?

35:11.340 --> 35:13.140
While the MMR scale was at its height,

35:13.140 --> 35:16.980
the entire media landscape was a unified front

35:16.980 --> 35:18.720
in saying, wrongly,

35:18.720 --> 35:22.320
that autism is the worst fate imaginable for a child

35:22.320 --> 35:25.320
and much worse than dying of measles,

35:25.320 --> 35:28.160
so a lot of kids didn't get vaccinated.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.700
Then again, it wasn't all bad.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.500
Some parents just vaccinated their children

35:32.500 --> 35:35.320
for measles, mumps, and rubella separately,

35:35.320 --> 35:37.920
which, by the way, was pretty expensive.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.340
But they don't want their child to have MMR.

35:40.340 --> 35:42.420
They'd rather pay for single vaccines

35:42.420 --> 35:44.080
at 60 pounds a shot.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.760
60 quid?

35:45.760 --> 35:47.600
By jolly, governor!

35:47.600 --> 35:49.680
Imagine millions of parents wanting

35:49.700 --> 35:52.540
an expensive alternative vaccine

35:52.540 --> 35:54.880
because all of a sudden a study had come out

35:54.880 --> 35:57.640
saying that the regular one might cause autism

35:57.640 --> 36:00.340
and a prominent scientist was cautioning against it.

36:00.340 --> 36:02.560
He'd urged the government to split MMR

36:02.560 --> 36:04.180
into separate vaccines.

36:04.180 --> 36:06.100
Giving the measles on its own

36:06.100 --> 36:10.060
reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.200
Why, whoever was producing and selling

36:12.200 --> 36:15.360
the alternative vaccine would be in for a fucking goldmine,

36:15.360 --> 36:16.320
wouldn't they?

36:16.320 --> 36:19.660
They'd make an absolute fortune.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.840
Here's a funny thing about that.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.840
Part four.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.220
Andrew Wakefield is a lying conman

36:25.220 --> 36:26.360
who wanted your money.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.680
Oh, sorry. That puts me at risk of libel, doesn't it?

36:28.680 --> 36:29.900
Hold on. Let's revise that.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.820
Part four.

36:31.820 --> 36:34.940
In my opinion, Andrew Wakefield is a lying conman

36:34.940 --> 36:36.020
who wanted your money.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.120
So we have Wakefield's paper

36:38.120 --> 36:41.740
and the implication that MMR might cause autism in there

36:41.740 --> 36:43.240
and you have Wakefield saying,

36:43.240 --> 36:44.860
I ain't got several vaccines.

36:44.860 --> 36:46.660
You and I can both agree

36:46.660 --> 36:49.280
that there might be a conflict of interest there

36:49.320 --> 36:53.880
if, if Wakefield was selling an alternative vaccine, right?

36:53.880 --> 36:56.880
We can all agree that would be fucked up, wouldn't it?

37:00.580 --> 37:03.960
Here's Wakefield's patent on an alternative measles vaccine.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.720
This little piece of shit was filed six months

37:06.720 --> 37:08.220
before the study was released.

37:08.220 --> 37:12.020
So, uh, what's going on there, Andy?

37:12.020 --> 37:15.220
Something you want to tell us, buddy?

37:15.220 --> 37:18.680
It's time to introduce someone new to the story.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.680
Brian Deer is an award-winning investigative reporter

37:21.680 --> 37:23.960
with a long history of exposing medical fraud,

37:23.960 --> 37:26.060
specializing in the pharmaceutical industry,

37:26.060 --> 37:27.440
and the perfect sort of person

37:27.440 --> 37:28.980
for the middle of this health scare.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.800
Deer was one of the few journalists

37:30.800 --> 37:32.900
who didn't simply accept what Wakefield

37:32.900 --> 37:34.440
was saying at face value

37:34.440 --> 37:36.780
and thought to dig a little deeper into the study

37:36.780 --> 37:38.360
and what he was really up to.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.660
Deer called the hospital Wakefield worked at

37:40.660 --> 37:42.360
with some basic questions,

37:42.360 --> 37:44.080
the kind that Wakefield apparently

37:44.080 --> 37:45.500
wasn't used to getting.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.120
Within three hours of doing so,

37:47.140 --> 37:49.180
Wakefield's publicist, you know,

37:49.180 --> 37:51.520
doctors hiring publicists to promote them.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.780
That happens all the time,

37:52.780 --> 37:54.360
had made a complaint about Deer

37:54.360 --> 37:56.020
to the newspaper he worked at.

37:56.020 --> 37:58.520
Deer, of course, only grew more interested.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.780
His eventual 2004 documentary,

38:00.780 --> 38:02.400
MMR What They Didn't Tell You,

38:02.400 --> 38:04.580
is the better documentary I mentioned before,

38:04.580 --> 38:07.080
and by better, I mean blew the doors

38:07.080 --> 38:08.960
off of Andrew Wakefield's whole scheme.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.340
It was Deer who discovered Wakefield's patent.

38:11.340 --> 38:13.260
Let's take a look at that patent now.

38:13.260 --> 38:15.540
The present invention relates to a new vaccine

38:16.380 --> 38:18.760
for the prevention and or prophylaxis

38:18.760 --> 38:21.020
against measles virus infection.

38:21.020 --> 38:24.640
Now, I'm not a big-time science-talking fancy guy,

38:24.640 --> 38:27.480
but this sounds a little bit like a measles vaccine.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.020
The patent was submitted in June 1997,

38:30.020 --> 38:32.240
so Wakefield had done most of the study

38:32.240 --> 38:34.020
and then rushed to patent a method

38:34.020 --> 38:36.740
of making a competing vaccine he could sell later.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.080
And guess what? If you look closely at the patent,

38:39.080 --> 38:42.200
you can see a familiar name on there next to Wakefield's.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.080
Remember Hugh Fudenberg?

38:44.160 --> 38:46.500
The quack who thought he could cure autism

38:46.500 --> 38:48.840
after having his medical license revoked?

38:48.840 --> 38:51.500
His name is also on the patent!

38:51.500 --> 38:54.720
He's credited as a co-inventor of this vaccine!

38:54.720 --> 38:56.340
Fudenberg's company,

38:56.340 --> 38:59.100
the very real and legitimate-sounding

38:59.100 --> 39:02.520
Neuro-Immunotherapeutics Research Foundation,

39:02.520 --> 39:05.220
is listed on the patent along with a business address.

39:05.220 --> 39:06.860
In the documentary where he revealed

39:06.860 --> 39:08.220
the existence of this patent,

39:08.220 --> 39:11.360
Brian Deer went to that address to try to find Fudenberg

39:11.360 --> 39:13.780
and discovered the company had already shut down

39:13.820 --> 39:15.980
and the building had become a real estate agency.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.860
Looking that address up now, it appears to be a hairdresser's.

39:18.860 --> 39:20.320
Doesn't look like one of America's

39:20.320 --> 39:21.900
premier research foundations.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.160
When he did find him, Deer asked Fudenberg

39:24.160 --> 39:26.860
about the whole thought-he-could-cure-autism thing

39:26.860 --> 39:29.540
and, uh, well, I, uh, ha, ha, ha.

39:29.540 --> 39:32.700
Do you believe that autism can be cured?

39:32.700 --> 39:34.160
Yes.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.460
Cured? Yes.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.580
It's cheap, it's oral, no injections.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.300
One pill a day, every other day for three or six months.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.860
And where, where does that come from?

39:43.860 --> 39:45.200
From my bone marrow.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.200
From your own personal bone marrow?

39:46.200 --> 39:47.400
Yeah.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.200
I mean, that's, that seems extraordinary.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.200
Yeah.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.420
♪♪

39:52.420 --> 39:54.960
Just to quickly remind you, this man is the co-inventor

39:54.960 --> 39:57.120
of Wakefield's alternative vaccine.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.040
You know what? You got me.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.720
Vaccines might be dangerous.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.460
And just in case it wasn't extremely obvious

40:03.460 --> 40:06.680
what a hasty fucking scam Wackyfield

40:06.680 --> 40:08.960
and his one friend who agreed with him

40:08.960 --> 40:11.180
were putting together,

40:11.180 --> 40:14.060
Fudenberg's name is spelled wrong on the patent.

40:14.060 --> 40:16.280
The other inventor of this vaccine

40:16.280 --> 40:19.620
besides Andrew Jeremy Wakefield

40:19.620 --> 40:24.080
is one Hugh Fundenberg.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.820
Nice one, Jeremy.

40:26.820 --> 40:29.420
By 1999, Wakefield was the director

40:29.420 --> 40:30.780
of several medical businesses,

40:30.780 --> 40:33.160
Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Limited

40:33.160 --> 40:34.920
and Carmel Healthcare Limited,

40:34.920 --> 40:36.660
named after his wife at the time.

40:36.660 --> 40:37.760
She later divorced him.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.500
He started shopping these companies around

40:39.500 --> 40:41.920
for investors based on the very convenient patent

40:41.920 --> 40:44.700
he'd got right before the health scare he caused.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.120
But in addition to the vaccine,

40:46.120 --> 40:48.080
Wakefield had another product in mind.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.720
If autistic enterocolitis turned out to be real,

40:50.720 --> 40:51.920
big if there, I know,

40:51.920 --> 40:54.420
that would mean there would be a completely new market

40:54.420 --> 40:56.640
in the form of testing for this new disease.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.880
Wakefield planned on producing and selling

40:58.880 --> 41:02.440
diagnostic kits meant to test for autistic enterocolitis.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.900
A private and confidential prospectus

41:04.900 --> 41:07.860
for potential investors acquired by Brian Deer claimed,

41:07.900 --> 41:09.720
It is estimated that the initial market

41:09.720 --> 41:12.860
for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing

41:12.860 --> 41:16.400
of patients with AE, autistic enterocolitis,

41:16.400 --> 41:18.600
from both the UK and the USA.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.520
Describing the target audiences as,

41:20.520 --> 41:21.780
Parent groups and lawyers

41:21.780 --> 41:23.700
representing affected individuals.

41:23.700 --> 41:24.540
And,

41:24.540 --> 41:26.040
Major pharmaceutical companies.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.820
These prospectuses also calculated

41:27.820 --> 41:29.540
how much these businesses would be worth.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.840
It is estimated that by year three,

41:31.840 --> 41:33.880
income from this testing could be about

41:33.880 --> 41:36.280
£3,300,000,

41:36.280 --> 41:39.740
rising to about £28 million.

41:39.740 --> 41:40.860
Adjusting for inflation,

41:40.860 --> 41:44.380
that upper estimate is about $72 million.

41:44.380 --> 41:45.700
If you think that's bad,

41:45.700 --> 41:48.160
years earlier he estimated a much larger number

41:48.160 --> 41:50.760
to the for-profit branch of the Royal Free Medical School.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.080
£72.5 million per year.

41:54.080 --> 41:57.040
Almost $200 million in today's money.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.840
In an inventor school investor meeting document

41:59.840 --> 42:00.760
that Deer obtained,

42:00.760 --> 42:02.640
Wakefield teased they could charge

42:02.640 --> 42:04.640
premium prices for the technology

42:04.640 --> 42:05.980
he intended to develop.

42:05.980 --> 42:08.900
Wakefield also became director of a third business,

42:08.900 --> 42:11.400
Unigenetics Limited, in the Irish Republic.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.860
Wakefield applied for and was successfully given

42:13.860 --> 42:17.700
£800,000, more than $2 million today,

42:17.700 --> 42:20.380
in government funding to begin developing the test.

42:20.380 --> 42:22.420
And this is all on top of how much money

42:22.420 --> 42:24.800
Wakefield would get if he managed to get the funding

42:24.800 --> 42:26.880
to manufacture his alternative vaccine.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.220
Companies like Axcan Pharma in Canada

42:29.220 --> 42:32.060
were paying to fly him out to discuss his business plans.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.100
According to Brian Deer,

42:33.100 --> 42:35.220
he was also negotiating a consultancy

42:35.220 --> 42:37.680
with Johnson & Johnson and developing connections

42:37.680 --> 42:40.060
with both Merck and SmithKlineBeachum.

42:40.060 --> 42:43.060
This guy was sure he was gonna be rolling in money.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.720
I wonder if this might point to a financial incentive

42:46.720 --> 42:48.360
to discredit MMR.

42:48.360 --> 42:52.860
Hmmmmm...

42:52.860 --> 42:53.360
Ah!

42:53.440 --> 42:55.380
Watching Wakefield repeatedly push

42:55.380 --> 42:58.440
for getting alternative vaccines just in case

42:58.440 --> 43:00.400
is really chilling to watch now.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.280
You have to watch him sit there and create demand

43:03.280 --> 43:05.400
for his planned future products,

43:05.400 --> 43:07.620
and no one watching knows what he's up to.

43:07.620 --> 43:11.120
They think he's a doctor just asking questions about MMR.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.960
No wonder he wasn't anti-vaccine.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.660
He wanted you to buy his!

43:14.660 --> 43:16.840
That said, there were a few roadblocks

43:16.840 --> 43:18.500
to the success of these businesses.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.720
The first is that autistic enterocolitis

43:20.720 --> 43:22.880
is a fake disease he just made up,

43:22.880 --> 43:25.800
which means it's very hard to invent a test for it.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.380
In Ireland, at Unigenetics,

43:27.380 --> 43:28.880
Wakefield brought in a colleague,

43:28.920 --> 43:31.700
John O'Leary, to try to get the testing kits to work.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.880
O'Leary claimed his test could find measles virus

43:34.880 --> 43:37.080
in the bowels of autistic children.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.680
He'd found measles virus in most of the samples

43:39.680 --> 43:42.760
he'd tested from children with autism and bowel disease.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.460
This is the closest Wakefield or any of his cohorts

43:45.460 --> 43:48.920
would ever come to proving autistic enterocolitis exists,

43:48.920 --> 43:50.680
but this quickly fell apart.

43:50.680 --> 43:53.480
Every other lab that tried to recreate his results

43:53.480 --> 43:54.640
found the same thing.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.680
The only way his equipment could get the results

43:56.700 --> 43:58.860
he was getting is if there was contamination

43:58.860 --> 44:01.000
or if his machine had been calibrated wrong.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.820
It turned out later it was both.

44:02.820 --> 44:05.280
Test tubes that didn't have measles in them

44:05.280 --> 44:07.080
tested positive for measles.

44:07.080 --> 44:10.460
O'Leary had an 11.1% stake in Immunospecifics,

44:10.460 --> 44:12.420
the company which would be selling the kits,

44:12.420 --> 44:14.220
which would have made him incredibly rich

44:14.220 --> 44:15.920
if the test had eventually worked,

44:15.920 --> 44:18.640
but strangely he stopped being able to get these results

44:18.640 --> 44:20.920
once people started scrutinizing his work.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.880
So that's 800,000 pounds of taxpayer money

44:23.880 --> 44:24.880
down the drain.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.260
♪ ♪

44:27.260 --> 44:29.380
The second problem was that potential investors

44:29.380 --> 44:31.220
who looked into his alternative vaccine

44:31.220 --> 44:34.560
even slightly would notice that the guy who co-invented it

44:34.560 --> 44:36.640
was a doctor who had just been fired

44:36.640 --> 44:38.060
and thought he could cure autism

44:38.060 --> 44:39.760
using his fucking bone marrow!

44:39.760 --> 44:42.280
So I guess what I'm saying is there was a slight delay

44:42.280 --> 44:44.240
in finding people willing to fund it.

44:44.240 --> 44:47.240
Finally, as Wakefield tried to launch his businesses,

44:47.240 --> 44:48.620
there was a critical shake-up

44:48.620 --> 44:50.280
at the hospital he was working at.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.660
While many of the Royal Free Hospital's higher-ups

44:52.660 --> 44:55.160
were fans of Wakefield's controversial paper

44:55.160 --> 44:56.860
and the attention it brought to the hospital

44:56.860 --> 44:58.280
and medical school, and some of them

44:58.280 --> 45:01.000
were even involved directly with his new businesses,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.660
in late 1999 the school got a new head of medicine

45:04.660 --> 45:06.000
named Mark Pepys.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.880
Pepys was a specialist in fields close to what Wakefield

45:08.880 --> 45:10.720
was speculating about in his papers,

45:10.720 --> 45:12.760
and like most scientists who knew anything

45:12.760 --> 45:15.380
about the subject could tell something was up.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.600
Wakefield was sent a letter voicing concerns

45:17.600 --> 45:19.920
about the scientifically unjustified basis

45:19.920 --> 45:21.480
of the work the companies were doing

45:21.500 --> 45:23.340
along with the incredibly obvious

45:23.340 --> 45:25.380
conflicts of interest happening here.

45:25.380 --> 45:27.100
You know, you kind of have a vested interest

45:27.100 --> 45:28.760
in proving a link between vaccines,

45:28.760 --> 45:30.140
bowel disorders, and autism

45:30.140 --> 45:32.940
when you intend to make millions of pounds off it.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.900
Even then, they volunteered to support Wakefield more,

45:35.900 --> 45:37.400
but not in the way he wanted.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.400
Remember that thing I said about pilot studies?

45:39.400 --> 45:40.940
I'm sure you do. You have a good memory.

45:40.940 --> 45:42.120
I really respect that about you.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.860
They offered to continue employing him,

45:43.860 --> 45:47.120
but only if he undertook a new, much bigger study

45:47.120 --> 45:50.160
to actually explore the original study's findings properly.

45:50.180 --> 45:53.220
He was offered help with a study on 150 patients

45:53.220 --> 45:55.720
to confirm what he had only really speculated about

45:55.720 --> 45:57.600
so far with a study of 12.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.780
Good scientific practice now demands that you and others

46:00.780 --> 46:03.660
seek to confirm or refute robustly, reliably,

46:03.660 --> 46:05.440
and above all, reproducibly,

46:05.440 --> 46:07.320
the possible causal relationships

46:07.320 --> 46:10.200
between MMR vaccination and autism,

46:10.200 --> 46:14.460
autistic enterocolitis, and inflammatory bowel disease

46:14.460 --> 46:16.820
that you have postulated.

46:16.820 --> 46:19.240
Autistic enterocolitis is in quotes.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.700
They don't believe him. It's great.

46:20.700 --> 46:23.660
This would be any legitimate scientist's dream.

46:23.660 --> 46:27.300
The freedom and support to fully explore a hypothesis

46:27.300 --> 46:28.680
and discover the truth.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.960
Wakefield agreed to perform the study,

46:30.960 --> 46:32.840
but then he never actually did it.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.420
Pepys would later go on to say Wakefield was

46:35.420 --> 46:37.260
a wanker and a fraud.

46:37.260 --> 46:40.940
Eventually, in 2001, after repeatedly ignoring calls

46:40.940 --> 46:42.980
to do the study he'd agreed to do,

46:42.980 --> 46:44.260
he was told to leave.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.980
Check out this article all about...

46:45.980 --> 46:47.480
Oh, I love journalism.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.760
Last November, Andrew Wakefield

46:49.760 --> 46:53.020
left the Royal Free Hospital by mutual agreement.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.640
Capitalizing on his perceived reputation with the public

46:55.640 --> 46:57.320
as a man who had discovered a link

46:57.320 --> 46:59.560
between vaccines and autism, Wakefield said...

46:59.560 --> 47:01.060
I have been asked to go

47:01.060 --> 47:03.820
because my research results are unpopular.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.780
This was meant to sound conspiratorial,

47:05.780 --> 47:08.360
like, they let me go because I'm making MMR look bad,

47:08.360 --> 47:10.820
but it seems like he was just unpopular with people

47:10.820 --> 47:13.660
because they could tell he was a fraud and a wanker.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.200
At this point, Wakefield's career

47:15.200 --> 47:17.380
as far as real medicine was concerned

47:17.400 --> 47:19.980
was over and his businesses failed to get off the ground

47:19.980 --> 47:22.320
because he no longer had any legitimacy left.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.820
What pharmaceutical company or other investor

47:24.820 --> 47:27.580
is gonna give money to a doctor who just got fired

47:27.580 --> 47:29.700
for refusing to prove the thing he's trying

47:29.700 --> 47:31.960
to get funding for even exists?

47:31.960 --> 47:34.920
In 2003, Deer's investigation was in a full swing

47:34.920 --> 47:36.700
and beginning to uncover all of this.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.800
He also made a really interesting discovery

47:38.800 --> 47:41.500
about something that took place during the original study.

47:41.500 --> 47:43.960
You know that whole autistic enterocolitis thing?

47:43.960 --> 47:46.100
Both his theories about MMR's danger

47:46.100 --> 47:48.320
and his new businesses making testing kits

47:48.320 --> 47:50.660
for the disease rested on being able to find

47:50.660 --> 47:52.620
the measles virus in the intestines

47:52.620 --> 47:53.780
of children with autism.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.000
The question we've been asking,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.780
is measles virus present

47:57.780 --> 47:59.920
in the intestine of these children?

47:59.920 --> 48:03.080
The BBC documentary covered this search extensively

48:03.080 --> 48:04.760
with Wakefield saying in an interview

48:04.760 --> 48:06.620
that proving it was there would require

48:06.620 --> 48:09.640
finding the RNA of the virus in tissue samples.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.180
The gold standard now is to find

48:12.180 --> 48:13.800
the gene of the virus in there.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.060
The big deal here is if Wakefield can't find

48:16.060 --> 48:18.560
the gene of the virus, then his theory is wrong.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.980
In these interviews, Wakefield is trying to imply

48:20.980 --> 48:23.140
that they've only just started looking for the virus,

48:23.140 --> 48:25.100
so they haven't found it yet, but that's okay.

48:25.100 --> 48:27.660
They've only just started looking, right?

48:27.660 --> 48:29.660
This turned out to be a lie.

48:29.660 --> 48:32.860
Deer discovered that Wakefield had already looked for it

48:32.860 --> 48:34.000
and it's not there.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.780
Dr. Nick Chadwick worked on Wakefield's paper

48:36.780 --> 48:38.580
and was a specialist on methods

48:38.580 --> 48:41.420
of finding measles RNA in tissue samples.

48:41.420 --> 48:44.120
Wakefield actually helped co-author some of his work,

48:44.140 --> 48:46.700
so of course, Wakefield had Chadwick look

48:46.700 --> 48:48.980
for measles RNA in the tissue samples

48:48.980 --> 48:50.700
taken from the children in the study.

48:50.700 --> 48:52.540
These were the children Wakefield was sure

48:52.540 --> 48:54.660
must have measles somewhere in their guts

48:54.660 --> 48:56.700
since he was blaming their autism on it.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.540
However, when he looked,

48:58.540 --> 49:01.160
he never found any measles whatsoever.

49:01.160 --> 49:04.460
Did you find measles virus in those children?

49:04.460 --> 49:07.000
No.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.800
No single case did I find any measles virus

49:09.800 --> 49:10.800
in those children.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.220
This means that Wakefield already knew

49:13.280 --> 49:15.280
before he even published the paper

49:15.280 --> 49:17.040
that measles couldn't be found

49:17.040 --> 49:18.780
in the guts of autistic children.

49:18.780 --> 49:21.460
Dr. Wakefield's theory was that it was measles virus itself

49:21.460 --> 49:23.380
that was responsible for a bowel disease

49:23.380 --> 49:26.720
and then leading on to some kinds of autism

49:26.720 --> 49:28.260
and you found no measles virus.

49:28.260 --> 49:29.260
That's correct.

49:29.260 --> 49:31.800
The final published version of the 1998 study

49:31.800 --> 49:33.840
doesn't have Dr. Chadwick's name on it

49:33.840 --> 49:35.600
even though he did a lot of work for it.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.940
Chadwick later wrote in a signed declaration

49:37.940 --> 49:39.600
that he specifically asked for his name

49:39.600 --> 49:40.900
to be left off the paper

49:40.900 --> 49:42.780
because he wasn't comfortable with how Wakefield

49:42.840 --> 49:44.380
was still pushing his theory

49:44.380 --> 49:47.580
even though he'd found zero positive tests for measles.

49:47.580 --> 49:49.880
By this point, he was already planning

49:49.880 --> 49:52.140
to launch a business selling testing kits

49:52.140 --> 49:53.180
based on this theory,

49:53.180 --> 49:55.640
so he ignored the work in his own lab

49:55.640 --> 49:57.560
that disproved him and kept saying

49:57.560 --> 49:59.600
he thought measles could cause a bowel disease

49:59.600 --> 50:00.600
that leads to autism

50:00.600 --> 50:02.260
and kept looking there for measles

50:02.260 --> 50:03.680
for years afterwards.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.100
The BBC documentary is about his hunt

50:06.100 --> 50:07.240
for the measles virus

50:07.240 --> 50:09.980
because even four years after launching his paper,

50:09.980 --> 50:11.860
he still hadn't found anything else

50:11.860 --> 50:13.320
to back up what he was saying.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.740
I actually have to give some credit now

50:14.740 --> 50:16.080
to this BBC documentary.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.900
Even though they mostly side with Wakefield

50:17.900 --> 50:20.320
and assume he's going to find the proof soon,

50:20.320 --> 50:22.200
there is one segment where the interviewer's like,

50:22.200 --> 50:23.200
wait a second.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.040
Shouldn't you have proved it

50:25.040 --> 50:26.920
before you said it?

50:26.920 --> 50:30.160
As I say, proof may be 10, 15 years away

50:30.160 --> 50:32.660
in terms of definitive scientific proof.

50:32.660 --> 50:33.760
So shouldn't you have waited?

50:33.760 --> 50:34.760
No.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.300
Obviously after discovering all this,

50:36.300 --> 50:39.180
Brian Deer had even more questions for Wakefield,

50:39.180 --> 50:41.380
which Wakefield was continuing to avoid.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.580
I've been trying now to speak with him for a year.

50:44.580 --> 50:46.160
We even wrote,

50:46.160 --> 50:47.960
but he didn't reply.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.300
Deer eventually just went to an autism conference

50:50.300 --> 50:51.540
Wakefield was speaking at.

50:51.540 --> 50:52.920
After his presentation,

50:52.920 --> 50:54.800
Deer approached him with questions.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.460
Dr. Wakefield, I'm sorry to interrupt.

50:56.460 --> 50:58.040
Brian Deer, Channel 4 Television.

50:58.040 --> 51:00.180
Um, could I talk to you about your research, sir,

51:00.180 --> 51:01.680
and your, uh, commercial ambitions?

51:01.680 --> 51:02.680
Excuse me.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.300
There's something kind of cathartic

51:04.300 --> 51:06.760
about just how guilty Wakefield acts here.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.440
Like, he's happily hanging around after his talk,

51:09.460 --> 51:12.300
casually answering questions from concerned parents

51:12.300 --> 51:13.420
and other reporters,

51:13.420 --> 51:16.340
and then the instant he recognizes Brian Deer,

51:16.340 --> 51:19.300
the guy he's been actively avoiding for over a year,

51:19.300 --> 51:22.100
he turns and leaves the room as fast as he can.

51:22.100 --> 51:23.600
Wakefield's only defense

51:23.600 --> 51:25.680
against his clear financial incentive

51:25.680 --> 51:27.900
to discredit MMR is to run away

51:27.900 --> 51:29.360
and hope you leave him alone,

51:29.360 --> 51:32.060
and since Deer clearly wasn't doing that,

51:32.060 --> 51:33.940
Wakefield decided to escalate.

51:33.940 --> 51:35.520
A few months after this footage

51:35.520 --> 51:38.120
of him heroically running away like a baby

51:38.120 --> 51:39.960
from basic inquiry was broadcast,

51:39.960 --> 51:42.120
Wacky Andy filed a defamation lawsuit

51:42.120 --> 51:44.420
against Channel 4, who produced the documentary,

51:44.420 --> 51:46.880
the Sunday Times, who published some of Deer's reporting,

51:46.880 --> 51:51.420
and additionally, he sued Brian Deer's personal website,

51:51.420 --> 51:53.180
briandeer.com.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.720
Can you imagine being that petty?

51:55.720 --> 51:59.480
In 2004, 10 of the paper's original 13 authors

51:59.480 --> 52:01.680
came forward to publicly retract

52:01.680 --> 52:03.760
the interpretation section of the paper.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.940
Half a decade after its publication,

52:05.940 --> 52:07.480
a vast majority of the people

52:07.500 --> 52:10.340
who worked with Wakefield on his paper

52:10.340 --> 52:11.800
have gone on record to say

52:11.800 --> 52:13.840
they think his conclusions are bollocks.

52:13.840 --> 52:16.400
At this point, Wakefield's study's coffin

52:16.400 --> 52:18.140
has fallen through the floor

52:18.140 --> 52:20.060
from the sheer weight of all the nails

52:20.060 --> 52:21.280
that have been hammered in it.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.560
So that's the foundational study

52:24.560 --> 52:26.660
of the anti-vaccine movement.

52:26.660 --> 52:29.200
A hack fraud's bullshit paper

52:29.200 --> 52:30.660
claiming that a handful of parents

52:30.660 --> 52:32.620
know better than all doctors

52:32.620 --> 52:36.280
so he could sell an alternative competing vaccine

52:36.300 --> 52:37.880
that he'd patented,

52:37.880 --> 52:42.340
which he thought he was gonna make millions selling.

52:42.340 --> 52:44.340
The evidence against the movement

52:44.340 --> 52:47.180
can't get much worse than that, can it?

52:49.720 --> 52:50.860
That was a joke.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.780
Part five, it gets much worse.

52:52.780 --> 52:54.280
Brian Deer didn't stop there.

52:54.280 --> 52:57.060
Wakefield was trying to sue him to get him to stop digging,

52:57.060 --> 52:57.980
and guess what?

52:57.980 --> 53:00.480
One of the first rules of investigative reporting

53:00.480 --> 53:03.200
is that if they try and sue you for finding things out,

53:03.200 --> 53:04.940
you're probably onto something.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.560
I mean, he brought me into the story

53:06.560 --> 53:09.560
by virtue of the fact that years ago he sued me.

53:09.560 --> 53:11.940
He discovered that two years before the paper

53:11.940 --> 53:14.360
was published, Wakefield had been hired

53:14.360 --> 53:16.700
by a lawyer to conduct the study.

53:16.700 --> 53:18.160
The lawyer, Richard Barr,

53:18.160 --> 53:20.360
had realized there was potentially millions

53:20.360 --> 53:22.320
and millions of pounds in bringing

53:22.320 --> 53:25.200
a class-action lawsuit against MMR manufacturers

53:25.200 --> 53:27.320
on behalf of parents of autistic children,

53:27.320 --> 53:29.200
but since there was no actual evidence

53:29.200 --> 53:30.460
the vaccine did this,

53:30.460 --> 53:32.960
he paid Wakefield to find some.

53:32.980 --> 53:36.100
Wakefield charged Barr £150 an hour

53:36.100 --> 53:37.980
for the time he spent working on the study,

53:37.980 --> 53:42.280
eventually totaling over £435,000.

53:42.280 --> 53:45.740
In today's money, that's more than $1.1 million.

53:45.740 --> 53:48.540
This was more than eight times his yearly salary

53:48.540 --> 53:50.080
at his job at the hospital.

53:50.080 --> 53:52.280
Six months before the Lancet published the study,

53:52.280 --> 53:55.200
Barr sent Wakefield a letter saying, and I quote,

53:55.200 --> 53:56.460
actually, I got Sean to say it.

53:56.460 --> 53:58.040
I have mentioned to you before

53:58.040 --> 53:59.920
that the prime objective is to produce

53:59.920 --> 54:01.880
unassailable evidence in court

54:01.880 --> 54:03.480
so as to convince a court

54:03.480 --> 54:05.940
that these vaccines are dangerous.

54:05.940 --> 54:07.060
Oh, okay.

54:07.060 --> 54:09.020
This whole thing was bullshit, wasn't it?

54:09.020 --> 54:10.900
And hey, remember Jabs?

54:10.900 --> 54:12.940
Jabs was involved with the lawsuit,

54:12.940 --> 54:15.400
and it turned out their members helped to recruit

54:15.400 --> 54:18.060
many of the parents to the study in the first place.

54:18.060 --> 54:20.580
I swear to God, this isn't one of the joke logos we made.

54:20.580 --> 54:22.740
This is actually the header on their Facebook page.

54:22.740 --> 54:25.120
This low-resolution, shitty nightmare.

54:25.120 --> 54:27.360
Jackie Fletcher, the founder of Jabs,

54:27.360 --> 54:29.620
was also a litigant in the lawsuit.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.620
They needed her connections to the dozen or so other parents

54:32.620 --> 54:35.540
who actually blamed MMR to be able to do all of this.

54:35.540 --> 54:37.240
Some of the parents were even involved

54:37.240 --> 54:38.340
with the lawsuit too.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.040
It's kind of clever if you think about it.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.760
A couple of parents blamed vaccines

54:41.760 --> 54:44.340
for their child's autism and wanted to sue its manufacturer,

54:44.340 --> 54:46.920
but there was no evidence it wasn't just a coincidence,

54:46.920 --> 54:49.100
so they told their opinions to a doctor

54:49.100 --> 54:51.260
their lawyer had hired who would then report

54:51.260 --> 54:52.800
those opinions in a paper,

54:52.800 --> 54:56.180
and now in court you can say there's scientific evidence

54:56.180 --> 54:58.520
implying a link between vaccines and autism

54:58.540 --> 55:01.220
even though the link is just those opinions from before.

55:01.220 --> 55:03.340
There's probably a word for this trick.

55:03.340 --> 55:05.260
Idea laundering? I don't know.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.600
Not all of the parents knew the study was being done

55:07.600 --> 55:08.600
to help a lawsuit,

55:08.600 --> 55:10.600
but they were all chosen deliberately.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.260
However, like we explored earlier,

55:12.260 --> 55:16.060
not many parents in 1996 blamed vaccines for autism,

55:16.060 --> 55:18.520
so they had to cast a wide net to even find

55:18.520 --> 55:20.200
the couple of parents they did.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.520
Child 11 wasn't even from England.

55:22.520 --> 55:23.940
He was from California.

55:23.940 --> 55:26.360
If a contact of Jabs or Richard Barr

55:26.360 --> 55:28.540
thought you might suspect vaccines

55:28.540 --> 55:29.920
made your child autistic,

55:29.920 --> 55:32.920
you and your child were being flown around the world

55:32.920 --> 55:34.540
to take part in this study,

55:34.540 --> 55:37.300
and even then some of the parents still turned out

55:37.300 --> 55:38.960
not to blame the vaccine.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.500
I cannot stress enough what a fucking shambles

55:41.500 --> 55:42.500
this paper was.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.380
Most of the other doctors working on the study

55:44.380 --> 55:47.220
had no idea the guy running it had been paid

55:47.220 --> 55:49.980
hundreds of thousands of pounds to discredit MMR.

55:49.980 --> 55:51.820
According to Chadwick's later testimony,

55:51.820 --> 55:54.780
Wakefield worked separately with each individual scientist

55:55.740 --> 55:57.440
instead of bringing them all together,

55:57.440 --> 55:59.400
which would have been the normal thing to do.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.700
This afforded Wakefield a good level of secrecy

56:01.700 --> 56:02.700
about his motives.

56:02.700 --> 56:04.620
The other scientists must have largely thought

56:04.620 --> 56:06.460
they really were looking into a connection

56:06.460 --> 56:08.780
between autism and bowel disorders in children,

56:08.780 --> 56:11.500
so even the doctors and scientists involved

56:11.500 --> 56:13.500
were being lied to and tricked

56:13.500 --> 56:15.420
into lending their time and effort

56:15.420 --> 56:17.580
to a study being done to help a lawsuit

56:17.580 --> 56:19.500
make some lawyers a lot of money.

56:19.500 --> 56:21.220
Once all of this came out,

56:21.220 --> 56:24.300
Wakefield was, medically speaking, fucked.

56:24.320 --> 56:26.900
While he'd been asked to leave his post years earlier,

56:26.900 --> 56:30.040
he still had a license to practice medicine in the UK,

56:30.040 --> 56:31.960
but amidst all of these discoveries,

56:31.960 --> 56:34.740
the General Medical Council began a fitness-to-practice

56:34.740 --> 56:36.080
hearing against Wakefield,

56:36.080 --> 56:37.760
going through the records of the study

56:37.760 --> 56:40.180
to evaluate whether his behavior had been ethical.

56:40.180 --> 56:43.000
The row he started dominated the headlines.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.420
Now his conduct, not his views,

56:45.420 --> 56:46.880
will be making the news.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.180
This hearing would go on to last for 217 days,

56:50.180 --> 56:52.840
making it the longest in General Medical Council history

56:52.840 --> 56:55.220
and longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.

56:55.220 --> 56:57.640
This is Wakefield's only legitimate achievement.

56:57.640 --> 56:59.480
He made such a fucking mess,

56:59.480 --> 57:01.900
it took that long to pick through it all.

57:01.900 --> 57:04.820
Meanwhile, remember when Wakefield sued Brian Deer?

57:04.820 --> 57:06.700
This would turn out to be the worst mistake

57:06.700 --> 57:08.160
he ever made in his life.

57:08.160 --> 57:10.360
Because Wakefield's libel case

57:10.360 --> 57:13.400
was related to accusations of what he did during a study,

57:13.400 --> 57:16.320
that meant that the records of what happened in the study

57:16.320 --> 57:18.320
were evidence in the case now.

57:18.320 --> 57:21.120
I mean, how else were they gonna prove it was libel or not?

57:21.120 --> 57:23.860
The judge agreed that Deer had to be granted access

57:23.860 --> 57:26.660
to the confidential, unredacted medical records

57:26.660 --> 57:28.080
of the children from the study.

57:28.080 --> 57:30.740
By trying to sue a journalist into shutting up,

57:30.740 --> 57:33.580
Wakefield had accidentally given him permission

57:33.580 --> 57:35.300
to see everything.

57:35.300 --> 57:37.920
Deer recalls being sat in a room with his lawyer,

57:37.920 --> 57:39.800
reading the medical records of the children

57:39.800 --> 57:41.800
and other records of what happened in the study

57:41.800 --> 57:43.800
while Wakefield's legal team were rushing

57:43.800 --> 57:46.340
to get a cab to take them to the courthouse

57:46.340 --> 57:48.520
so they could drop the suit and stop him reading it

57:48.520 --> 57:49.760
as fast as they could.

57:50.740 --> 57:53.000
Deer got home that night to a call from his lawyer

57:53.000 --> 57:55.620
saying the case—new firmware available?

57:55.620 --> 57:56.620
Thanks, Windows!

57:56.620 --> 57:58.700
Deer got home that night to a call from his lawyer

57:58.700 --> 58:00.200
telling him the case was over,

58:00.200 --> 58:01.380
and as a fun bonus,

58:01.380 --> 58:03.260
because of how lawsuits work in the UK,

58:03.260 --> 58:05.580
Wakefield had to pay Deer's legal costs,

58:05.580 --> 58:07.880
the check for which Deer keeps proudly displayed

58:07.880 --> 58:10.640
on his website, but Deer wasn't done yet.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.920
Wakefield had just dropped a lawsuit

58:12.920 --> 58:14.840
to stop him finding things out.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.840
But in the context of that lawsuit,

58:16.840 --> 58:19.060
a great deal of information was disclosed to me

58:19.060 --> 58:20.400
by Wakefield's lawyers,

58:20.400 --> 58:22.060
and it was quite clear I had to continue.

58:22.060 --> 58:24.320
Deer continued his research and also attended

58:24.320 --> 58:26.940
many of the GMC's hearings about Wakefield's conduct

58:26.940 --> 58:29.040
which discussed many of the same records

58:29.040 --> 58:31.320
he just dropped a lawsuit to hide,

58:31.320 --> 58:33.840
and based on all of this, he put the pieces together

58:33.840 --> 58:36.620
and figured out exactly what happened during the study.

58:36.620 --> 58:39.420
The result of his work is an absolutely incredible series

58:39.420 --> 58:42.220
of articles first published in the British Medical Journal.

58:42.220 --> 58:43.420
♪♪

58:43.420 --> 58:45.000
There's another fucking firmware!

58:45.000 --> 58:46.680
Why is there so much firmware?

58:46.680 --> 58:48.800
Deer figured out who some of the previously

58:48.800 --> 58:51.340
anonymous parents of the children in the study were

58:51.340 --> 58:53.340
and showed some of them what the study said

58:53.340 --> 58:55.420
about their children, and it turned out

58:55.420 --> 58:56.760
the paper was lying.

58:56.760 --> 58:58.760
For example, he showed the medical records

58:58.760 --> 59:00.340
to the father of child 11.

59:00.340 --> 59:02.600
And he looked at the paper, and he just looked

59:02.600 --> 59:04.560
at what it said about his own child,

59:04.560 --> 59:07.600
and he said, that's not true.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.320
And that was, uh, one of the parents

59:10.320 --> 59:11.780
of one of these children in the paper.

59:11.780 --> 59:14.520
In a correspondence with Deer, he literally wrote...

59:14.520 --> 59:16.820
The Lancet article indicates that autistic symptoms

59:16.820 --> 59:19.860
started 15 months, a week after the MMR,

59:19.860 --> 59:22.100
which is completely inaccurate.

59:22.100 --> 59:25.360
My son's autistic behavior started 2 1⁄2 to 3 months

59:25.360 --> 59:28.700
after the MMR, which was administered to him

59:28.700 --> 59:30.120
at 15 months.

59:30.120 --> 59:34.000
The bottom line is, if my son is indeed patient 11,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.120
then the Lancet article made a false assertion

59:36.120 --> 59:39.200
that his symptoms set in immediately after the MMR,

59:39.200 --> 59:43.300
in service of some attorney's efforts to prove causation

59:43.320 --> 59:47.240
that, unbeknownst to me, apparently drove this research.

59:47.240 --> 59:49.460
He told Deer Wakefield had said his son

59:49.460 --> 59:51.500
was the 13th child they'd looked at

59:51.500 --> 59:53.120
and wasn't included in the paper,

59:53.120 --> 59:55.200
and that's why none of the information in the study

59:55.200 --> 59:57.000
seemed to describe his son.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.720
According to Brian Deer, Wakefield had rewritten

59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.600
his son's medical history and lied to him to cover it up.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.760
And this wasn't the only parent who had their story

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.980
changed by Wakefield.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.680
You see, for the study to be useful in Barr's lawsuit,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.480
they needed to establish a temporal link

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480
with the vaccine.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.860
Since this is the age autism usually develops,

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.020
they needed it to be within 14 days

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.620
and, if possible, even closer.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.660
I mean, otherwise, it might seem like it was just

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.280
a coincidence, which it is, but like child 11,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.660
the onset of autism wasn't convenient enough

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.300
in almost any of the other children.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.380
The table suggests that eight of the 12 children's parents

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.180
claimed the symptoms happened within 14 days,

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.960
but according to Brian Deer's reporting

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.340
from the medical council hearings,

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.460
many of the parents never said this,

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.300
and most of the children's medical records

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.300
put their symptoms starting way after this time period

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.960
with some of them showing symptoms

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.600
of what could have been autism before they were vaccinated.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.940
Almost every child's autistic symptoms

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.940
either started way too late to be useful in the lawsuit

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.520
or way too soon.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.240
Wakefield just lied and changed the times

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.020
and allegations of the parents around

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.520
until the paper said what he needed it to say.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.900
This is the thing that makes so much of what he said

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.300
during the scare really fucking infuriating.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.800
Like, he would constantly bring up

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.680
how he was just listening to the parents

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.760
and reporting what they were saying.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.480
We believe.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.600
We trust in the parents' story.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.480
If you think there was a problem with my shitty study,

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.900
you're calling all of those parents liars.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.100
How dare you?

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.240
When they say to you,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.700
I believe my child regressed after the MMR vaccine,

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.400
do you take that seriously or not?

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.700
Damn right you do.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.860
Damn right you do.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.740
He got all high and mighty about how you need

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.260
to believe the parents when he had made up

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.140
most of what the parents had said

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.260
and the media fucking ate it up too.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.480
Andrew Wakefield is one of the few doctors

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.060
to listen to parents who believe their children

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.940
were damaged by MMR.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.780
He's the only doctor who listens to the lies

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.820
that he wrote for a lawsuit he was being paid to help with.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.900
Fucking hell.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.580
Remember that new syndrome Wakefield came up with?

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.400
Now we know why he did that.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.040
To pursue a class action lawsuit

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.820
against the vaccine's manufacturers

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:07.120
and convince a court of the vaccine's danger,

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.660
to quote a judge, Barr needed it to cause

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.660
a distinct and specific clinical syndrome.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.240
If all the kids just had random bowel disorders,

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.620
there wouldn't be a clear enough link to the vaccine,

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.320
but if they all had a fancy new disease,

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.860
he could argue they were all caused by the same thing.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.620
Wakefield invented autistic enterocolitis,

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.580
which he repeatedly called a genuinely new syndrome

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.580
in the media so the lawsuit could justify itself.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.860
Of course, to do this,

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.400
all the children's bowel disorders

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.280
would have to actually look similar enough

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.540
that they could reasonably be called the same thing.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.740
The paper listed 11 of the 12 children

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.120
having some form of nonspecific colitis,

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.780
creating the illusion that they all had a similar disorder.

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:48.080
According to the actual medical records,

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.440
only three of them had any major inflammation whatsoever.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.280
The study had a pathologist on board

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.900
to determine what sort of bowel diseases the children had.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.160
When she and her team ruled out colitis

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.440
in over half of the children,

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.400
which would obviously have been bad for the lawsuit,

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.640
Wakefield brought in a second pathologist

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.140
who had worked with him before to run the tests again.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.600
When the second pathologist didn't even make mention

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.220
of colitis in his reports,

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.980
Wakefield ignored both of them and just wrote in the paper

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.640
that 11 of the 12 children had similar nonspecific colitis.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.280
Wakefield went over the heads of everyone on his team

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.820
who didn't find any colitis and decided by himself

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.980
that all the children had a special new gut disorder

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.600
that causes autism.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.600
What the fuck?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.760
But that's not all.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.880
You know how most of the children in the study

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.840
were diagnosed with a form of autism

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.620
and how, like, that's the entire point

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.920
that most of them had autism?

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.000
Like, that's the whole thing?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.800
Well, it turns out that some of the children

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.420
reported as autistic in the study

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.040
didn't even have autism.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.580
♪♪

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.620
Child seven was never diagnosed with autism

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.380
before, during, or after this study.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.500
He was referred to the study because child six,

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.120
his brother, was diagnosed with autism.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.420
Wakefield reported that this child was also autistic

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.240
and started showing signs of autism

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.580
24 hours after being vaccinated.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.460
I mean, why not if you're just making shit up, right?

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.000
Child 12 had also never been given an autism diagnosis.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.380
The developmental specialist who diagnosed them

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.380
said they had an impairment in respective language

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.920
but did not diagnose them with autism.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.580
Wakefield, who, just to remind you,

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.380
is a gut surgeon with no psychiatric expertise

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.620
whatsoever, decided this was enough for him

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.260
to say they were autistic

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.760
and since their parents didn't blame the vaccine,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.720
he said loss of speech development

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.420
and deterioration in language skills

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:41.140
noted at 16 months and made sure to mention

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.300
the child had MMR at 15 months

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.040
just so you know it started soon after the vaccine

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.300
even though the parents didn't blame it.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.140
Oh, and while he was there, he diagnosed them

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.380
with chronic nonspecific colitis too.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.680
You can see why Wakefield dropped his lawsuit

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.000
as fast as he could when Deer got permission

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.080
to read these, right?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.500
This is likely why he never did

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.540
the larger study when he was asked to.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.540
Once this fraudulent paper was out,

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.920
all the extra attention and scrutiny he gained

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.620
would have made it impossible to lie

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:08.960
and get away with it again.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.160
To this day, no attempt to recreate

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.380
Wakefield's findings has ever succeeded.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.040
The paper that started the obsession

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.260
with the connection between autism and vaccines

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:19.880
was a total fraud crafted by a lawyer

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.500
and the opportunistic doctor who he bought

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.920
and in the last 20 years,

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.420
data from millions and millions of children

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.840
all over the world indicates no link whatsoever.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.600
The only paper that came close to showing that link

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.960
is a study so full of lies that even before it was out,

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.000
scientists who worked on it were asking

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.800
to have their names taken off.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.720
The paper wasn't just badly made.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.260
It wasn't just questionable.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.500
It wasn't bold and controversial.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.640
It was a lie for money,

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.100
but the worst thing about this study

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:54.600
was that somehow even that wasn't the worst thing.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:58.580
["Wakefield"]

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.580
["Wakefield"]

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.960
["Wakefield"]

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.380
Hey, folks, the next section deals

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.800
with some pretty heavy stuff,

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.080
so if you're not into stories of child abuse,

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.500
uh, skip to the next chapter.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.500
["Wakefield"]

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.000
As we've already explored,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.800
Wakefield was trying to discover a new disease

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.760
linking autism and bowel disorders,

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.300
so during the study, he did everything he could

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.760
to find that link.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.880
For this reason, each child underwent

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.300
a rough battery of invasive procedures.

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.840
The children spent a full week at the hospital,

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.880
during which they were frequently sedated,

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.220
given laxatives, had blood samples taken,

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.960
and then they were given colonoscopies,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.000
lumbar punctures where a needle is inserted

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.380
between the bones of your spine to extract fluid,

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.560
MRI scans, again under sedation,

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.300
electroencephalograms where wires and electrodes

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.720
are run to the patient's head,

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.100
and a variety of other uncomfortable procedures.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.340
A doctor once described this list of tests

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.380
as a lot even for adults to go through,

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.640
never mind autistic children.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.140
Now, there's this thing in medicine

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:00.060
called informed consent.

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:03.100
Doctors can't just do invasive procedures on people.

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.720
You have to inform the patient

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.440
of the potential risks and dangers,

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.680
and you can only move forward with their approval.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.820
In this study, the children were very young,

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.860
and some of them, emphasis on some, were autistic.

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.320
This meant the children's parents

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.160
had to give informed consent for them.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.400
Andrew Wakefield wrote a handout to parents

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.700
to go with the consent form,

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.280
describing the procedures and their potential risks.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.440
SurCare, a human rights organization,

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.400
acquired a copy of this handout,

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.360
and while the form does mention

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.240
almost every procedure Wakefield intended to do,

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.820
it doesn't mention any of the risks associated with them.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:36.920
I'm serious.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.660
The word risk is literally

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.300
not written anywhere on the form.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.540
So let's talk about the risks of some of these procedures.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.720
For those of you who don't know,

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.640
a colonoscopy is when a large tube

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.340
with a camera in it is inserted through your rectum

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.040
all the way up into your guts.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.460
Normally, this is an important

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.300
and safe diagnostic procedure.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.460
It's the most accurate test for rectal and colon cancer,

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.040
and this saves a lot of lives.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.000
Sorry, I'm gonna take a moment and turn this video

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.720
into a public service announcement for colonoscopies.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.720
Um, get one.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.060
I'm being serious.

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.860
If you're an adult, especially over the age of 45,

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.480
and you've never had a colonoscopy,

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.440
please seriously consider getting one.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.640
I've lost an uncle and a close friend

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.740
to bowel cancer at shockingly young ages.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.400
It's a really common cause of death,

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.320
and if they catch it early, it's treatable.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.080
Colonoscopies are perfectly safe

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080
and often life-saving procedures,

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.280
but in children whose intestines are smaller

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.280
and weaker and harder to maneuver in,

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.620
there are risks of serious complications.

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:36.420
The scope can puncture the intestine,

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.760
which causes bacteria from the gut to leak out

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.720
and cause infection and other serious internal damage.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.220
Risks of complications are significantly higher

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.140
for children five years or younger.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.440
We try to be very careful to come around corners.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.100
And these risks are genuine.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.740
As part of the attempts to find more evidence later

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.280
and follow up on the original 1998 study,

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.160
a five-year-old autistic boy was given a colonoscopy

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.780
that went exceedingly wrong

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.080
and was left fighting for his life

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.540
with multiple organ failure after his bowel

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.420
was perforated in 12 places during the procedure.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.880
There was no medical reason this child needed this procedure.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.420
He was just being used as a guinea pig

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.200
to find any proof they could

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.540
that autistic enterocolitis was real.

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:21.580
The Royal Free had to pay almost £500,000,

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.460
roughly a million dollars today,

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.380
in damages to the boy and his parents

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.220
for causing lifelong disabilities

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:28.800
that required full-time care.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.300
His parents reported that when they gave consent,

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.840
they had not been told of the risks.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.980
If this is true, what happened here is an assault.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.940
They almost killed this child,

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.900
and in the 1998 study,

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:42.940
they inflicted this procedure

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.840
on children as young as three.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.040
Wakefield's consent form insists

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.800
that these procedures are usually tolerated well

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.020
by children and that it is entirely painless.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.900
It gives zero mention of the very real risks

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.820
of inserting several feet of a scope into a child.

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.940
It even says,

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.860
if your child becomes distressed

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.740
or the procedure proves too difficult,

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.440
it will be performed under general anesthetic.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.980
The form doesn't mention the risks

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.580
of this anesthetic either.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.100
This normal consent form for a colonoscopy

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.300
makes incredibly clear that there are risks

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.100
of perforation and bleeding

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.720
and the possible adverse reactions

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.100
to being sedated too.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.640
In case you're watching, Andy,

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.980
this is what informed consent looks like,

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:24.980
you piece of shi-

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.680
Wakefield needed these parents

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.360
to consent to these procedures.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.860
His paycheck was resting on finding something

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.320
in the bowels of these children

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.020
that could possibly point to the disease

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.320
he was trying to invent,

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.780
so he wrote a handout that conveniently

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.360
didn't mention how risky some of these procedures

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400
actually were.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.100
And from other accounts given to Deer

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.940
about what happened during the study,

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.740
the children's experiences were far

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.120
from safe and painless.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.240
Nurses were leaving and saying they didn't like

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.460
what was being done to these children.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.280
Junior doctors were unhappy.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.500
It needed three people to hold these kids down

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.800
in some cases just to have blood taken.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.920
These are difficult children to explain

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.960
to what is going on.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.040
I feel very sorry for the children

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.080
who I feel were being abused.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.060
Children were fainting and vomiting

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.920
and trying to resist the testing.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.920
They had to be force-fed some of the fluids

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.180
required for the tests.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.640
They couldn't give one child their lumbar puncture

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.060
because he was uncontrollably vomiting

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.980
from all the other procedures that had been done on him

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.980
and it was sent home.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.400
Another child's lumbar puncture

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.900
went so badly that he had to be rushed

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.320
to a different hospital for treatment.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.240
If you do stuff like this to kids in your study

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.700
for no clinically justified reason,

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.620
that's child abuse!

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.160
Wakefield treated the children

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.400
as if they had genuine bowel conditions.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.940
To that end, almost all of them

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.640
were given anti-inflammatory drugs

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.480
for the disorders he'd made up for them.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.520
These medications often have an increased risk to children,

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.440
particularly under the age of six.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.740
The risks of adverse events

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.900
includes life-threatening complications

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.360
including increased bleeding,

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.820
increased risk of infections,

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.580
and other severe side effects.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.960
Some of these kids had problems communicating,

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.880
which would make reporting any side effects

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.960
they were experiencing very difficult,

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.460
further increasing the risk of severe problems

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.720
if something went wrong.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.980
Considering that barely any of these children

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.020
actually had bowel disorders,

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.140
Wakefield was essentially putting children

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.440
at risk of the side effects of these drugs

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.200
for no reason while he looked for proof

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.160
of the disease he was trying to invent

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.820
to make a lawsuit look good.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.540
The Medical Council also discovered

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.000
that during the study,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.780
Wakefield gave an experimental drug

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.580
to one of the children without waiting for approval

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.800
from an ethics committee.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800
The drug was called

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.520
Dialysable Lymphocyte Extract Transfer Factor.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.020
Wait a second.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.640
The paper is a pilot study

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.560
on the effects of a substance called

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.360
Dialysable Lymphocyte Extract on children with autism.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.480
Did Wakefield test one of Fudenberg's

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.160
autism-curing drugs on one of the children in his study?

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160
What the fuck?

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160
Thanks, Andy.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.660
I'm sure whatever you gave those kids

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.000
was perfectly safe.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.780
I mean, if this genius was behind it.

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.200
Where does that come from?

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.200
My bone marrow.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.240
To convince the child's father to agree

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.400
to let him administer this drug to his child,

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.320
Wakefield offered him a job as managing director

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.820
of a company making and selling the drug.

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.420
Um, okay, my producer told me I can't say that.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.380
There's no way of proving that happened

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.660
behind closed doors, so just to clarify,

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.580
we don't have evidence that Wakefield

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.500
offered a man a job to give his son a drug.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.300
It might just be a coincidence

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.000
that the father became managing director

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.260
of a company that would profit

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.880
from selling the drug if it worked.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.980
Maybe he just happened to have equity

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.780
in the company that would be making the drug

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.160
that was experimentally given to his child.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.540
We will never know for sure how that happened.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.540
Ahem.

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.460
Let's just walk through that again.

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.620
Andrew Wakefield might have offered a cushy job

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:52.460
to a guy to let him experiment on his kid

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.800
with a drug that he probably got from a guy

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.520
who got fired for stealing medical supplies,

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.020
wasn't a doctor anymore,

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.540
and thought he could cure autism

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.160
using his bone marrow.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.420
The aristocrats.

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.960
On top of all of this, during the investigation,

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.500
the medical council found out that during one

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.760
of his own children's birthday parties,

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.640
Andrew Jeremy Wakefield lined up

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640
all the other kids at the party

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.600
and offered them money for their blood.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.360
I have to try and explain this.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.200
In order to find any potentially useful evidence

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.860
for his study for the lawsuit,

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.960
he needed the blood of non-autistic children

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.380
so he could compare it and see what he could find,

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.420
but to get the blood, instead of, like,

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.300
putting in a request for non-autistic children's blood

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.000
or, like, calling for volunteers to come to the hospital

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.720
and give their blood and without running it past

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.600
an ethics committee, he offered his children's friends

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.640
£5 for their blood.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640
Ha ha ha!

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.980
And no, that's not, like, an allegation

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.940
that someone might have made up.

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:08.780
Wakefield told people that story at a conference in 1999.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.540
At the hearing, he claimed to have made up

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.480
the part about throwing up and fainting

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.740
for dramatic effect.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.400
His best defense of his extremely unethical

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.120
and weird behavior was that he made some of it up.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.080
Shockingly, telling the ethics committee

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.880
that he was a fucking liar didn't help his case.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.840
Speaking later in an interview,

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.420
Wakefield defended the birthday party child blood bribes,

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:48.040
saying it was all totally fine.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.720
The only problem was that it did not have an approval

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.140
from the hospital ethics committee.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320
That does not make it unethical.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.900
He's trying to well, actually, a fucking ethics board.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.700
After reviewing all of this, in 2010,

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.360
the longest inquiry in general medical counsel history

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.540
concluded that Andrew Wakefield had failed

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.880
in his duties as a doctor,

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.880
acted against the interests of his patients,

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.460
and was, you know, a lying con man.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.500
Sorry, that one was me.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.260
And he was struck off the medical register,

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.640
making him no longer able to practice medicine

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.420
and officially not a doctor,

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.060
so whenever someone calls him a doctor in videos now,

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.180
they're making a mistake.

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.820
Look, I don't want to single this guy out,

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.280
but you shouldn't put doctor in his name.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.440
He's not a doctor now.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.780
Even in the documentary he made about himself in 2016,

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.440
he can't put doctor in front of his name.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.440
He has to put MBBS.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.240
Well, we know he's at least one kind of BS

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240
if you know what I'm saying.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.660
To quote the counsel's charges,

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:45.160
he showed callous disregard for any distress or pain

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.540
the children might suffer.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.540
That same year,

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.580
the Lancet finally formally retracted the original study.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.080
According to the Lancet's editor, Richard Horton,

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.160
it was utterly clear without any ambiguity at all

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.860
the statements in the paper were utterly false.

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.200
Well done, Richard.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.540
Here's a round of applause for you.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.280
Better too late than never, I guess.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.840
That's not really an expression, is it?

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.880
The conclusion of the inquiry is protested

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.340
by Wakefield's remaining supporters.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.460
We're with Wakefield!

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.340
We're with Wakefield!

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.140
While a news crew attempts to interview one of his critics,

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.200
one of his supporters attempts to shout him down

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.860
and make sure he can't say anything,

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:25.820
while another off-screen holds up a book

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.320
insisting it is they who are being silenced.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.420
The irony is apparently lost on them.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.340
Wakefield appeared before his flock

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.420
to say this was all completely unjust.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.380
And I invite anyone to examine

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.100
the contents of these proceedings

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.920
and come to their own conclusions.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.060
I think we just did, buddy.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.440
Wakefield did lose a lot of his popularity

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.400
when the extent of his abuse and fraud was made known,

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.820
but he still had a few dedicated fans.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.740
Often the parents of autistic children

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.120
who'd followed him so far

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120
that they refused to accept what he did.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.380
To Wakefield, these desperate people

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.120
are the perfect market.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.040
I suspect the main reason he turned up

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.500
in the last few days of his hearing

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.960
was to advertise the book he'd written

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.800
all about it on national TV.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.000
The book alleges that the Medical Council hearings

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.720
are just trying to crush him to protect vaccines.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.760
He titled the book,

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.800
after one of the council's comments about him.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.660
It's trying to be an ironic reference.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.540
Like, he's accusing mainstream medicine

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:25.300
of callously disregarding the victims of MMR,

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.600
but I don't think he considered the implications

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.520
of quoting a doctor pointing out he abused children

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.480
on the cover of a book with a big picture

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.520
of his face on it.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.020
It's a real if I did it situation.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.180
Also in the dedication,

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.140
he thanks his long-suffering wife

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.520
who's with him here on the cover.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.160
She's not his wife anymore though.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.440
I guess she suffered enough

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.320
and like separate vaccines before it,

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:47.340
Wakefield made sure to recommend his book

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.880
in every interview he got.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.600
These numbers, the dates were all fabricated

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.180
to sort of make a case.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.260
Dr. Gupta, please, I urge you,

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.760
go and read my book.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.480
You will understand it. Many people don't.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.440
It's very funny watching him try to sell his merchandise

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.240
now that everyone knows he's a fraud.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.940
If you read my book, you will be able to read the truth.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.160
And has the BMJ read my book?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.620
Have the doctors who apparently looked at all the records

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.280
read my book? No, because the truth is in that book.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.420
Sir, I've read Brian Deer's report,

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:17.920
which is incredibly extensive.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.520
Sir, I'm not here to let you pitch your book.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.160
I'm here to have you answer questions.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.960
If you read the record that I have set out in the book,

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.160
you will see the truth.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.000
But sir, if you're lying, then your book is also a lie.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.760
Wakefield's defense against Brian Deer's allegations,

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.600
now that suing him to shut him up has failed disastrously,

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.200
is to say Deer is a hit man

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.320
paid by vaccine manufacturers to ruin his career.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.160
He is a hit man.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.680
He's been brought in to take me down

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.960
because they are very, very concerned

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.080
about the adverse reactions to vaccines

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.120
that are occurring in children.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.920
Wait a minute, sir. Let me just stop you right there.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.960
You say he's a hit man and he's been brought in by they.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960
Who is they? Who is he a hit man for?

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.320
This is an independent journalist

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.440
who's won many awards.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.600
Yeah, he's, uh, and he's, you know,

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.800
who brought this man in?

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.960
Who is paying this man? I don't know.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.160
Who is behind Brian Deer's reporting?

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.400
Follow the money.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.080
Also, buy my book, please.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.800
Wakefield went on to claim later in the interview

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.600
that you're being paid by the Association

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.040
of British Pharmaceutical Industries.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.080
Are you?

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.600
No, I'm not.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.480
In 2011, New York Times Magazine staff writer

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.680
Susan Dominus caught up with Wakefield.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.600
Though Wakefield presents himself to her

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.600
as someone whose career was destroyed

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.480
for going against the dogma that vaccines are safe,

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.880
Dominus is careful to point out that he does this

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.560
while signing copies of his book

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.600
for an enormous line of loyal followers,

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.000
one of whom is a tearful mother who blames herself

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.880
for not preventing her child's autism.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.520
At the time the article was written,

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.200
Wakefield lived in a beautiful house

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.120
in a reclusive and expensive neighborhood

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.400
in Austin, Texas,

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.360
surrounded by many acres of hills and forest.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.560
You can almost believe you're in Tuscany,

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.560
he says of the view from his back deck.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560
The book made him a decent amount of money,

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.120
as have his many paid speaking engagements

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.400
at anti-vaccine conferences where he's lauded

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.800
as the celebrity who got the movement started.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.640
There's the hundreds of thousands of pounds

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.640
he got paid to do the study, of course,

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.040
and the multiple documentaries about him and his life

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.560
can't have been too shabby for him.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.600
It's genuinely shocking how obviously

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.720
he's just grifting anti-vaccine people

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.120
for as much money as he can.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.480
His 2016 film, Vaxxed,

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.840
is available at a discount on his website

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.040
if you buy it in a pack of ten.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.080
Give a copy to your local legislators,

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.280
educators, and medical professionals.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.440
Wakefield wants his followers to pay him

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.040
to do advertising for him.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.080
When I look back at footage of the last day

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.600
of Wakefield's hearing,

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:36.080
I'm inevitably looking back at myself ten years ago

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.080
when I saw the same footage live on TV.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.880
At the time, I saw these people as Wakefield's defenders,

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.880
but in a way, they were also his victims.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.440
For a decade now, since I was a teenager,

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.880
I've been thinking about this woman

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880
with the sign saying,

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.160
don't stifle uncomfortable science.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.800
I remember I first noticed her

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.840
because I saw her and thought,

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.960
wait, is she wearing a Playboy scarf?

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.760
Surely the most uncomfortable thing

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.080
for these people here must be the possibility

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.280
the man they're here to defend has lied to them for money.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.280
For someone who'd sided with Wakefield

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.680
during the scare, accepting that he had lied

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.360
would mean taking on some of the guilt

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.800
for helping to spread it.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.040
One of the worst things about Wakefield's actions

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.360
is he's made these people complicit.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.760
Maybe Wakefield actually cares about these people.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.760
Maybe not, but either way,

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.000
their money spends just the same.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.520
I wonder how many of these people bought his books

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.320
or his documentaries.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.880
I wonder if any of them stop and think

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.760
about how they've made him rich.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.040
Some of these people are extremely vulnerable,

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.160
parents of children with disabilities,

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.240
some of which require full-time care,

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.840
who fell for Wakefield because he was offering them

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.720
an explanation for why these things happen.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.000
It brings me no joy to tell you

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.080
they paid for this view.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.280
We're with Wakefield!

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.320
We're with Wakefield!

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.480
We're with Wakefield!

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.480
We're with Wakefield!

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.320
At the end of all this,

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.880
I ask the eternal question

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.800
asked of every major fraudster in history.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.000
How could someone do all this?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.200
Cause all this fear and doubt

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.600
that has led to real, tangible harm

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.160
against your fellow human beings?

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.800
Why would someone do that?

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.840
Uh, money, thank you for watching.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:30.880

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.000
There's probably a lot of people you could blame

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.320
for anti-vaccine beliefs getting as far as they have.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.600
The anxieties people have right now

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.000
didn't come from nowhere.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.920
Wakefield's legacy is built into the very DNA

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.720
of modern vaccine hesitancy.

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.600
Or the RNA, am I right?

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.240
Nice one, Kat. It's very clever.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.720
Whenever you try to trace a trend of skepticism

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.320
about vaccines far enough,

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.080
it almost always leads back to the fear and anxiety

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.160
that started in 1998 and the men behind it.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.240
Take, for example, Bill Maher.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.040
Maher is a proponent of the possible link

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.360
between vaccines and autism

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.200
and frequently has anti-vaccine activists on his show.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.840
Granted, he also has people on who think that's ridiculous,

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.560
so that's kind of like being fair and balanced.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.040
His general stance is that vaccines can be good,

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.240
but he doesn't really go for them

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.640
because he's got a better idea.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.080
I am not a germ theory denier.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.320
I understand that germs and viruses cause diseases.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.880
I may have been a little cocky about it

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.720
because I discovered from first-hand experience

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.840
that I could stave them off better with proper nutrition.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.440
If your child dies of measles,

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.000
it's because he didn't eat his vegetables.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.240
Bubonic plague!

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.280
Skip a trip to McDonald's, sheeple!

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.040
Throughout the years, Bill has repeated over and over

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.720
his distrust of vaccines

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.960
and the possible side effects they might pose.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.280
I've tried to find an example of him citing a source

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.800
or giving some kind of data,

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.760
but no, it's always this general sense

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.040
that people think something might be wrong.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.640
There's all these parents who say,

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.960
I had a normal child, got the vaccine.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.640
This story keeps coming up.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.240
Lots of parents are saying stuff,

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.760
and that's basically evidence,

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.560
and of course there's the old standout,

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.600
lots of people feel like me.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.320
I was attacked for saying we should look into this

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.360
and I don't believe in it

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.240
and lots of people feel the same way.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.640
I've heard a lot of stuff about feelings

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.240
being more important than facts,

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.960
so this is basically science, right?

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.560
Bill, you having us on the show

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.920
and rehashing all these problems

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.280
you got yourself into on your last show,

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.520
it's like going on a date and talking about your ex-wife.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520
Yeah!

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.240
Yeah!

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.280
If an intellectual titan like Bill Maher

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.120
thinks vaccines might be dangerous,

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.040
he must believe it for a good reason.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.280
I did a lot of digging on this,

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.600
and I found a time when he made

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.880
a concrete scientific claim about vaccines.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880
In 2005, he was interviewed on Larry King Live.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.360
This isn't footage of that interview.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.640
I couldn't find footage of this one,

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.600
but there is a transcript on the CNN website.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.720
During this interview, they discuss the flu shot,

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.840
which King had been taking for 25 years.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.720
Maher tells him the best defense against disease

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.120
is to have a strong immune system.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.000
I guess that's where the proper nutrition comes in

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.840
and says that the flu shot is actually bad

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.920
for your immune system.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.520
He cites a strong distrust

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.840
of what he calls Western medicine,

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.800
which is a bit of a Eurocentric misnomer.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.440
A lot of non-Western countries develop vaccines

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.080
and other modern medicine, you know.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080
Whatever. He doesn't care.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.320
The conversation then turns to the avian flu,

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.160
which was a real concern at the time.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.200
Bill states that he's not worried about bird flu

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.200
and gives a fascinatingly vague list of reasons why.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.680
First of all, it's not going to happen,

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.880
which was a very clever insight

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.760
right up until something like that really did happen.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.040
Uh, that's why people were worried about it, Bill.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.280
Second of all, the fact it is mutating

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.720
shows that if you did come up with a vaccine tomorrow,

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.040
it wouldn't be effective against the disease

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.680
when the disease comes because the disease

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.640
is always morphing and mutating.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.400
Bill is such a good public speaker.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.400
The fact that vaccines actually help stop

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.000
the disease from spreading

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.080
and therefore developing those mutations

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.280
in the first place is lost on him.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.920
Well, it was, but he got vaccinated for COVID-19,

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.160
so clearly he sees the value now.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.680
This is attached to an announcement

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.960
that he got the virus,

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.880
so this week's show has to be canceled.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.200
Apparently, he's asymptomatic and feels fine,

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.200
so I guess vaccines are pretty good, aren't they?

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.200
Considering how at-risk unvaccinated 65-year-olds

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.320
are for this virus,

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.080
I'm really glad he got vaccinated for his sake,

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.280
but they should probably just cancel his show completely.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.480
I mean, we don't want to risk losing a national treasure.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.880
The reality is a lot of pseudo-libertarian skepticism

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.640
about Western medicine instantly falls apart

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.040
the second it has to interact with reality

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.480
where people really do die of diseases.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.200
For example, the man he is speaking to,

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.120
Larry King, passed away this year

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.320
of complications from COVID-19.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.280
Anyway, Ma tells King that vaccines

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.600
are just a trick to get money.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.040
It's just a way to funnel money

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.000
into the pharmaceutical companies.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.240
Follow the money.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.320
You'll find out where the bird flu is.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.680
If bird flu had got bad enough,

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.520
you can guarantee Ma would have paid

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.880
top dollar for the vaccine.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.480
Anyway, the discussion goes downhill

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.400
even further for Ma when King points out

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.840
that vaccines are great and polio was virtually eradicated

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.200
thanks to vaccination.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.880
Bill gives this beautiful reply.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.080
Yes, but, you know,

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.680
there are many books out that will...

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.160
that will...

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.200
and I'm not well enough versed on it to talk about it

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.760
that will indicate that there are other reasons

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.600
why it was.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.240
And a lot of diseases that have been, they say,

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.520
whoa, this was eliminated because of a vaccine,

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.560
they find out, well, no, actually,

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.600
the country got toilets and that's what happened.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.680
I think Bill really does a good job of summing up

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.960
a lot of people's beliefs about vaccination here.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.200
Ma thinks it's smart to be skeptical about vaccines

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.800
right up until there's consequences

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.840
for himself, of course,

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.880
but his explanations are all unfounded

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.040
and unscientific.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.760
The best he can say is there's probably books out there

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:51.000
that prove he's right, maybe,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.520
but he's not read them.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.520
This isn't skepticism.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.680
This is ignorance trying to sound like skepticism.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.040
To bring it all full circle,

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.240
it seems like Bill's beliefs about vaccines

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.000
are really based on that big scare

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.800
that started in the late 90s.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.680
After all, the only factoid he seems to ever be able

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.000
to remember is that lots of parents said

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.520
they were bad that one time,

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.880
and that's not even a fact.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.920
That's some opinions he remembers.

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.480
I'd joke that it's a pity they don't make a vaccine

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.800
for confirmation bias,

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.360
but he wouldn't have got it, would he?

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.520
There is, however, one time in this old interview

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.520
where he really does attempt to make a scientific claim.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.760
He tells Larry that if you get the flu shot

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.560
more than five years in a row,

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.320
it tenfold increases the risk of getting Alzheimer's.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.720
Hmm, that's a really specific thing to say.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.400
Maybe by checking this claim out,

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.840
we can figure out who he's getting his beliefs from.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.600
I looked, and there are actually studies

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.800
on the impact of vaccination on rates of Alzheimer's.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.240
Um, the risk of Alzheimer's goes down.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.120
Okay, so this clearly isn't his source.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.560
I did some more digging, though,

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.040
and I found that in 1997 at a vaccine conference,

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.480
in one guy's presentation,

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.280
he said that a scientist had found that this happens.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.720
There's no study cited here,

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.400
but that's at least a source for Bill's claims.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.600
Let's check the doctor's papers

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.320
and see if we can find out for ourselves.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.480
Wait a second. I blurred the scientist's name out

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.400
by accident. Let me fix that.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.680
Dr. Hugh Fudenberg?

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680
Wahahahaha!

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.640
No matter how you look at it,

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.680
a vast, vast majority of anti-vaccine rhetoric

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.320
and pseudoscience can be traced directly back

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.720
to these two guys.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.160
According to a survey of U.S. health care professionals

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:31.240
in 2016, 77% of parents refusing vaccination

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.720
for their children still cite a fear of a link with autism.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.240
When people refuse medicine for their children,

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.560
they largely point to the hazy memory

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.840
of the scare Wakefield started for money.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.160
So yeah, it's pretty important to point out

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.880
they both lost their medical licenses

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.400
and their science was garbage,

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.240
and despite being an obvious hack, fraud, con man,

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.360
Wakefield is still embraced by the anti-vaccine community.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.400
Wakefield was a guest of honor at Conspiracy,

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.640
the week-long cruise for all kinds of conspiracy theorists

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.480
where believers of all stripes gather to share their theories

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.880
about climate change, the Earth being flat,

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:07.240
time travelers, and horses being real.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.600
The kind of funny thing is Wakefield himself

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.440
seems pretty embarrassed by this.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.560
A skeptic who went on the cruise noted how unhappy he looked

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.160
with the implication of being a hero to a community

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.880
that absolutely loves complete quacks.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.760
The story of my life is basically how to take

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.080
a perfectly good career and flush it down the toilet.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.760
Luckily for Wakefield, the toilet is full of money,

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.040
and all he has to do to get it is lean further

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.480
and further away from science and deeper into this culture.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.160
He's had to pivot to saying all vaccines are dangerous

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.160
because his new anti-vaccine audience

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.000
aren't very receptive to the old claim

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.280
that I'm not anti-vaccine, just one vaccine is dangerous,

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.200
and I recommend mine instead.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.560
I don't think these people would buy a 10-pack of that story.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.720
And of course, in the middle of the pandemic

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.360
that is currently happening,

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.200
Wakefield emerged from his mansion to remind everyone

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:00.040
that a virus that has so far killed over three million people

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.200
is better than being vaccinated against it.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.720
As Nelson Mandela said at his trial,

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.320
there are ideals worth dying for.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.200
Presumably of COVID-19.

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.120
I don't want to get too dramatic,

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:17.080
but better to die as a free man than live as a slave!

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.920
I don't think that was too dramatic, do you?

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.200
The fact the movement he started is still based

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:28.280
almost completely on his lies is pretty important to point out,

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.920
and in fact, it's useful to point it out

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.880
because despite how it might look,

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.360
the truth can be a powerful thing.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.520
Once Wakefield got chased out to America

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.360
and had his medical license taken away,

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.640
vaccination rates in the UK recovered.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.600
I love this because you can basically see

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.600
the effects of Brian Deer's reporting on a graph.

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.000
Like, the scare starts, and it gets worse and worse and worse,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.760
and then Brian Deer's reporting comes out,

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.320
and bam, it's on its way back up.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.480
Like, the truth does make a difference.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.120
And then when Wakefield's license was taken away,

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.920
we went right back up to pre-scare levels.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.880
Of course, getting chased out to America

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.120
meant he started peddling his lies in America,

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.800
so sorry about that, but it does seem pretty clear

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.120
that the truth helps people make up their minds

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.120
about this stuff.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.680
Fascinatingly, a lot of Britain

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.440
seems to remember the MMR scare

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.400
and the revelation that it was based on lies

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.880
and learned a lesson about vaccine alarmism.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.880
According to polls of global willingness

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.800
to take the COVID-19 vaccine,

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.880
other countries start relatively low,

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.800
perhaps dimly remembering some people

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.200
saying vaccines are bad.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.960
Then acceptance grows as it becomes increasingly clear

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.400
the new vaccines are safe.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.520
Wait, where's the UK?

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.560
Well, boys, we're just chilling up here.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.440
We've been through this before, you see.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:37.760
That's my British accent?

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.280
It seems like our past experience

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.080
with bullshit vaccine scares

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.320
has inoculated us against future ones.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.320
Cat wrote that line.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.280
I didn't find the one weird trick

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.240
doctors hate to deconverting people

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.480
from being against vaccines

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.760
and changing their minds or anything here.

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.320
What we've really discovered is that

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:57.360
if you lay the whole story out like this,

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.800
people can do a good job of making up their own minds.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.160
The actual scientific community works very hard

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.480
to be receptive to potential side effects.

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.600
When even the potential maybe possibility maybe

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.200
of one of the vaccines having side effects came up,

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.560
the FDA and the CDC briefly recommended

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.400
not getting it for a while until later

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.520
when they checked and were sure it was fine.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.640
Vaccine safety is taken extremely seriously

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.200
by medical scientists and doctors for obvious reasons.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.520
Actually, here's a fun example of how stringent

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.280
the community is about vaccines.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.920
Wakefield's alternative vaccine

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.800
was based on such bad science,

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.440
it would never have made it out of clinical trials.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.760
The medical work behind it was awful.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.160
I mean, one of its author's names

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.240
is spelled wrong on page one.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.960
The science on the following pages

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.520
is roughly what you'd expect from something like that.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.120
I think I might actually make a bonus video for patrons

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.200
just covering this vaccine patent

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.360
because it is whack.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.520
Really, Andrew Wakefield was always doomed

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.160
to end up as a scam artist.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.000
He wasn't very good at the science

01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.240
when he was a doctor.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.040
All the coronavirus vaccines currently in use

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.840
have passed tests and checks

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.640
that his alternative measles vaccine

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.840
would never have done.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.680
Wakefield can pretend he's not gonna get the vaccine

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.080
and appear at health freedom summits

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.680
that recommend you don't get it

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.280
and instead eliminate toxins

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.520
with only affordable products and cooking hacks,

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.080
but I certainly hope for his sake

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.240
that he just gets the vaccine in secret

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:23.840
because otherwise the next cruise

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.600
is gonna have a fucking body count.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:28.280
There is another way the truth can change people's minds.

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.480
Living proof.

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.560
If someone thinks the coronavirus vaccines

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.520
might be dangerous,

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.880
one of the best ways to help

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.000
seems to be people around them getting it

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.480
and showing them how it's fine.

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.760
In early polls before a vaccine was out,

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.240
a lot of people in the USA

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.600
claimed they were going to hold off

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.200
until they were sure it was safe,

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.920
which is a pretty risky decision

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.640
considering the danger of the virus

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.320
versus any possible side effects of the vaccine.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.280
Like, a third of people who get infected,

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.360
even if it's minor,

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.600
are left with long-term complications,

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.800
like long-distance runners are left unable

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.080
to climb stairs without getting out of breath,

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.600
people have lost eyesight,

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.000
people have lost teeth,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.080
and of course a lot of people have died of the disease,

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:09.800
but over time as more and more people did get the vaccine,

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.440
that by itself changed a lot of minds.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.800
The truth is it was easy in 2020

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.320
to have your doubts about a theoretical vaccine

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.680
that no one had had yet,

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.600
but now when half the people around you already have it

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.880
and they're obviously fine,

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.520
it's a whole lot harder to have those doubts.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.680
Over time, the people waiting and seeing

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.680
seem to have decided they've seen enough

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.280
and they want what those guys are having,

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.120
so this is my call to action in case anyone needs it.

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.680
You should get a COVID vaccine if you can.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.400
You know, get one while you're there for your colonoscopy.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.320
The vaccine makes life safer for you

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.800
and reduces the possibility of passing the virus

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.040
to someone more vulnerable,

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.080
so you won't have that on your conscience either.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.240
I know having a conscience is virtue signaling now,

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.880
but still, it's a nice bonus,

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.080
and on top of that,

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.720
if there are people in your life who could be at risk

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:58.160
who need convincing of the vaccine's safety,

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.640
you could be the evidence they need.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.200
It's amazing how compelling seeing other people

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.600
get vaccinated can be.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.480
There is, sadly, one concerning thing about the data.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.040
There are some people who started out

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.800
saying no to vaccination

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.680
and have largely stayed that way.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.000
Maybe some of them will budge

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
as more and more people get vaccinated,

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.880
but there's probably a group who are so distrustful

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.440
of vaccines because of everything

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.640
we've discussed so far

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.480
that they can't have their minds changed

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.080
even by the hundreds of millions

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.720
of obviously completely safely vaccinated people

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:29.720
all around them.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.360
People can invest a lot of ego and pride

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.760
in not accepting evidence

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.960
that contradicts their beliefs about the world,

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.760
and it really doesn't help that there are hundreds of people

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.680
exactly like Andrew Wakefield

01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.640
who are ready to tell them everything they believe

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.640
is already true,

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.960
and they just need to buy their supplements

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.840
or DVDs or cooking hacks

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.000
and enable people to convince themselves

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.560
that they don't need to do any more thinking

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.280
for a small fee, of course.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.280
Aw, come on, though.

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.920
Comparing Wakefield to Alex Jones,

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.920
that's a bit much.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.600
There's no way Wakefield would stoop to...

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:01.600
Ha ha ha!

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.040
Have you learned nothing?

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.040
Good to have you here with us.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.040
It's great to be here, Alex.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.040
Thank you very much.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.360
Changing these people's minds

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.680
really should be their job,

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.120
and it's nobody else's fault

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.320
that they're struggling with it,

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.960
but I think the future of this kind of discussion

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.040
resides in finding more compelling ways

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.480
of communicating the truth

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.520
to people who aren't used to hearing it.

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:22.000
I hope in some way this video has helped.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.560
In the meantime, while we figure out

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.440
how to convince people who seem committed

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.840
to being never convinced,

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.000
at least the vaccine intended for them

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.280
can go to someone who's sure they want it.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.080
Specifically, me.

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.040
Please send me their vaccine.

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.280
I was glad they were testing it on the old people first,

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.840
but it's been months now, and I want it.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.520
I want to go outside.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.920
Be able to go outside.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.160
I want to pretend I shop at Waitrose again.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.440
I want to use my free football tickets.

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.280
I want to taunt my former hairdresser

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:50.040
with how useless she is to me now

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.560
and threaten to turn her building

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.320
back into a research foundation.

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.960
Give me the vaccine, doctor.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.280
Hell, give me all of them.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.840
Let me combine their power.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.120
Soon I will be unstoppable.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.080
It's easy to get depressed and begin to believe

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.440
that you're basically locked in a room

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.360
with thousands of fucking idiots

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.640
who are just willing to say stupid shit constantly,

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:15.560
just committed to just being wrong,

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.440
but actually, the more I think about it,

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:22.960
I'm actually locked in a planet

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.720
with millions of people who do know better than these people,

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.760
but they're just so busy being depressed like me at them.

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.160
Maybe the answer here is that we just need to accept

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.920
that we should put the depression energy

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.320
into making a difference,

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.640
into changing the minds of the people who can be,

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.520
and into doing what we can to improve the state of our world

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.040
around these people,

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.880
and just let them be mad

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.960
and let them continue to be stupid,

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.160
but in a world where their kids won't die of polio

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.360
because we got rid of it for them.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.840
Good for them, ignorant little wankers,

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.240
because maybe the hard thing to do

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:57.040
when we're confronted by the scope of these problems

01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.440
is accept that we really can do something about it.

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.520
No matter how hopeless things may seem,

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.840
the world always can get better,

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.720
and maybe together,

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.560
someday, we can invent a way

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.400
of cleaning up this fucking mess in my mom's garage,

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.400
in my garage.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.720
Hey, thank you for watching.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:44.960
That was pretty good, wasn't it?

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.280
I managed to avoid getting too preachy at the end there.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.400
I'd like to thank my patrons,

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.080
whose names are scrolling past the screen right now.

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.800
You guys literally keep the lights on.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.400
I'd like to thank the sensitivity reader

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.720
who took a look at some of the segments

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:56.520
and made sure that we were using the appropriate language

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.720
when we were talking about autism.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.680
I'd also really like to thank Brian Deer,

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.680
who's basically a superhero.

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.920
He's the guy who found out most of this stuff,

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.360
really saved the day,

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.120
and just thank you so much, man.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.120
And also, while we were making this video,

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.520
Brian Deer released a book about the whole thing.

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:15.520
Deer's book,

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.920
the Doctor Who Fooled the World,

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.200
is basically the most definitive source

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.200
on Andrew Wakefield and all the damage he did.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.040
I literally cannot recommend it enough

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.600
if the topic interests you at all.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.040
Deer is by far the most knowledgeable person

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.200
on everything that happened.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.440
I mean, he's the guy who discovered

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.680
most of it himself through actual decades

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.080
of investigative reporting.

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.840
I had no idea he was doing a book

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.080
until it came out when I was writing this video,

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.080
and with that,

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.880
it came out when I was writing this video,

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.480
and we just barely scratched the surface

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.480
of the stuff he covers.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.180
There's a link to his site in the description,

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.820
and it's not an affiliate link or anything.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.280
We're not being paid to do this.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.720
I've decided he deserves your money.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.120
I want him to be able to chart the release of this video

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.760
on a graph of his sales figures.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.460
That's my personal fantasy.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.860
Tell him Hbomb says hi.

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.860
If you want to know more about this whole topic

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:02.660
or just check out Brian Deer's honestly heroic reporting,

01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.300
you should really go read his book

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:06.440
and go to briandeer.com

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.500
because it survived the lawsuit

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.040
and there's some great stuff there.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.880
So thanks to Kat for doing all of that additional research

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.480
and for co-writing a lot of these segments

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.280
and just generally fact-checking me.

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.840
I got a lot of facts wrong,

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.640
and I'd like to thank my, uh, intern, Rachel,

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.280
uh, who did great work with the camera.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.520
Don't do that.

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.020
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.560
Oh, wow, there are more credits.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.560
Oh, my God.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.560
Thank you so much for being

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.560
so patient with this video.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.560
I'm actually surprised

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.560
we got it done so quickly, to be honest.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.700
We had a whole production.

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.420
Like, we had to work with fact-checkers,

01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:39.120
lawyers in two different countries

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.500
to make sure we couldn't get sued

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.160
for anything we were saying about these people

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.400
because, you know, you might have noticed

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.560
some of the characters in this story are litigious.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.900
We conferred with vaccine experts,

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.700
doctors, science communicators,

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.840
medical researchers, sensitivity readers, animators.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.180
You know, someone had to draw the internal anatomy

01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:56.180
for that one thing.

01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.720
I made an award-winning cartoonist

01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.620
for the New Yorker spend hours of her life

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.780
drawing the courtroom from Phoenix Wright

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.940
for a joke that went by in, like, 10 seconds.

01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.340
Sorry about that, by the way,

01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:09.780
and my poor, long-suffering producer, Kat,

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.540
had to coordinate most of this for me

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.820
because I was busy editing the actual video,

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.020
and thank you to my patrons

01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:16.620
for watching an early draft of this

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.620
and giving me feedback.

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:18.780
It turns out a bunch of people

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:20.820
who watch my videos are, like, scientists,

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.620
so we got some really good notes from them.

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:24.160
All in all, I'm pretty happy

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.560
with how this video turned out,

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.060
so, yeah, that's nice.

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:28.760
That said, I'm never putting this much effort

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.100
into a video again.

01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.100
Forget it.

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:42.360
♪♪

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.140
Can you believe that Brian David Gilbert

01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:45.140
did voices in this video?

01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:46.800
That's great. It's amazing.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.240
He sent me just video footage

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.840
of him dressed as Andrew Wakefield.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.080
I didn't ask for him to do that.

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.440
He just sent that to me.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.820
Like, what a cool guy.

01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.820
That was great.

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.460
Oh!

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:03.500
Oh!

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
Oh!
