Don't worry. Vaccines are perfectly safe.

10

Hello, and welcome back to hell.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,060
I'm just vaccinating my profiteroles,

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,140
immunizing them against the horrendous disease

known only as not-enough-cream,

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
itis.

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Unfortunately, while vaccines are great

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,460
at stimulating my balls,

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,220
in humans, they've become quite the controversial topic.

18
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,300
In the late 90s, an anti-vaccine movement

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,520
started to pick up steam,

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,220
claiming that they cause autism.

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,480
And the movement has plenty of washed-up celebrities

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,400
flushing it, including What's-His-Name

23
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
and that one

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,780
and some more.

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,060
Here's 45th President of the United States,

26
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,700
Donald Trump, coming out against...medicine.

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,360
He once famously tweet,

28
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,300
No more massive injections.

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,260
Tiny children are not horses.

30
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,520
I mean, of course they aren't.

31
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,220
Horses aren't even real.

32
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,260
But if there's an entire movement of people

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,520
with documentaries and websites and Facebook pages

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,820
with thousands and thousands of members

35
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,520
backed by the former U.S. president,

36
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,320
why does everyone else seem to think

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
they're obviously wrong?

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,700
Has the mainstream medical establishment

39
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,940
science-cucked a majority of people

40
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,980
into thinking they're safe

41
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,860
so they can keep making money selling them?

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,940
The vaccine debate is complex

43
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,060
and multilayered

44
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,600
and hasn't been resolved for over two decades.

45
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,060
So obviously it needs me to come and put an end to it

46
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,320
in the space of a single YouTube video

47
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,900
by doing what I'm best at,

48
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,320
destroying things with my mouth.

49
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,440
Oh!

50
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,020
Oh!

51
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,100
Oh!

52
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,140
Mm!

53
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,060
Oh!

54
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,480
Oh, hi, Mum.

55
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Was I vaccinated?

56
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Have you been looking into moving out lately, son?

57
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Mm.

58
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,320
Now, the clever clogs among you

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
will know that there was an anti-vaccine movement

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,060
of sorts in the 1800s when they were first introduced,

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,200
but that movement died out on its own a long time ago.

62
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Oh, smallpox.

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,740
The main argument in the modern movement

64
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,060
is that they might cause autism.

65
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,900
So let's see what, on paper, this claim is supported by.

66
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,020
Yes, I just ended a sentence with a preposition,

67
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,820
and if that annoyed you, we get it.

68
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,940
Your school was expensive.

69
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,240
We're all very happy for you.

70
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,020
Part one, the easy version,

71
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,220
in case you don't feel like watching

72
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,560
this whole fucking video.

73
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,020
In 1998, a study came out alleging a link

74
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,100
between the MMR vaccine and autism.

75
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,820
MMR vaccinates against measles, mumps, and rubella,

76
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,440
which saves kids from having to get multiple painful shots

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,720
and parents from having to know what rubella is.

78
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,940
It was published in the Lancet,

79
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,440
a very well-known medical journal,

80
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,860
which made it seem credible.

81
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,020
However, the paper was eventually found guilty

82
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,560
of being bad.

83
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,020
The science turned out to be bonkers,

84
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,260
and multiple other studies on literally millions of children

85
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,180
did not show that there was a link,

86
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,840
and the paper was eventually retracted

87
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,500
by the journal that published it.

88
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,180
So retracted that it literally has

89
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,460
retracted written all across every page

90
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,760
in big red letters.

91
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,460
My printer just does black and white,

92
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,180
so I've actually got an artist's impression

93
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,140
of the real version.

94
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,000
So far, that's some pretty shaky ground

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,260
on the anti-vaccine side,

96
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,180
but later, new evidence came out that...

97
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,800
Oh, that's it. That's all the evidence.

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
This segment is over now.

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,720
Part two, the existential horror of...

100
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,560
Wait, that's it?

101
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,980
No, seriously, that's all the evidence.

102
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,980
There is nothing else even remotely credible.

103
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,100
There are some fringe pet theories

104
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,760
as to what chemical in the vaccines causes the autism,

105
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,360
but since vaccines don't cause autism,

106
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,760
they're kind of putting the cart before the squid here.

107
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,140
The anti-vax movement had next to no evidence 20 years ago,

108
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,900
and now they have even less.

109
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,560
But hold on there, Daddy-O.

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,060
Sure, you can sum up the entire issue in 52 seconds.

111
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,140
Wow. But really, I don't think that's good enough.

112
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,100
Everyone who's anti-vax at this point

113
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,720
has probably already heard

114
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,380
and isn't convinced by the easy version.

115
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,260
I mean, if you're on the fence about vaccines,

116
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,340
you're not gonna change your mind

117
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,380
because someone told you there was a paper once

118
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,560
but it got retracted,

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,020
no matter how much they pitch-shift

120
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,140
their voice in post.

121
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,560
Blue crash.

122
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
But what if you did want to change someone's mind

123
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,300
on topics like this?

124
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,480
The data on this issue is discouraging.

125
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,140
Research shows that when someone becomes

126
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,100
personally invested in an idea,

127
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,020
they can become very closed-minded,

128
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,060
or worse, a YouTuber.

129
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,020
Political science professor Brendan Nyhan

130
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,480
and his team spent three years

131
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
studying how over 1,700 parents

132
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,260
reacted to various different attempts

133
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,100
to convince them to vaccinate their children

134
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,020
and found that no matter what they tried,

135
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,060
parents who started out against vaccination

136
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,260
didn't change their minds,

137
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,600
and worse, trying to correct false claims

138
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
about vaccines actually made some parents

139
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,260
more against vaccinating.

140
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,560
Nyhan told the New Yorker,

141
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,640
it's depressing.

142
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,560
We were definitely depressed.

143
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,900
Now, as a fellow fan of logic and reason,

144
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,860
I'm also doing great,

145
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,280
but in today's particular, shall we say,

146
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,140
socioeconomic climate,

147
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,060
it's extra pressing that we figure out

148
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,820
how to get everyone on the same page

149
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,360
with regards to public health.

150
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,900
So the purpose of this video isn't just

151
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,240
to point out a group that's wrong about something.

152
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
The real question is,

153
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
when someone is wrong about something,

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,060
not just this, how do you change their mind?

155
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,600
Now, personally, I'm not sure how to do that.

156
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,180
If it was easy for humans to change their mind

157
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,180
about stuff, then this video wouldn't need to exist,

158
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,540
would it? But maybe we'll find some answers

159
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,420
by exploring what convinced people

160
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
vaccines might be dangerous in the first place.

161
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,580
We should probably begin with that old 1998 study

162
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,180
because, let's be honest,

163
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,080
how many people on either side of this discussion

164
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,380
have actually read it?

165
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,840
People don't read scientific papers.

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,260
They check out the blogs or videos of people

167
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,420
who they already agree with,

168
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,080
and they tell them what the science said.

169
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,420
And I mean, same.

170
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,300
I heard all the other people say the science was bad,

171
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,840
and I believed them.

172
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,800
And the anti-vax people probably just believed

173
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,500
whoever told them it was true.

174
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,660
So to be unbiased about this,

175
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,920
let's really start at the beginning.

176
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Look at the original paper.

177
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
That's the wrong page.

178
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Let's actually read this old paper

179
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,800
and see what it has to say

180
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,380
and come to an honest conclusion about its findings.

181
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,880
Five minutes later.

182
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
What the fuck?

183
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,540
This is why people are against vaccines?

184
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,120
This is the worst fucking paper I've ever read in my life!

Ah.

188
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,400
Right, let's talk about the study.

189
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,540
I'm calling it the study because its real title

190
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,820
was Ileal Lymphoid Nodular Hyperplasia,

191
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,080
Nonspecific Colitis,

192
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,440
and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children,

193
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,080
which is a bit of a tongue twister.

194
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,540
I had to do a not insignificant amount of Googling

195
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,440
to find out whether it's pronounced Ileal or I-leal.

196
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,040
Don't know why I bothered. If I got it wrong,

197
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,320
it's not like you would have noticed.

198
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,140
The paper's lead author is Dr. Andrew Wakefield.

199
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,860
I'm sorry. There's a mistake in my script.

200
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,560
The paper's lead author is disgraced ex-Dr. Andrew Wakefield.

201
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,440
Wakefield is seen by many as the founder

202
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,980
of the modern anti-vaccine movement

203
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,520
since he was behind the paper that started the whole thing.

204
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,680
Let's keep an eye on that guy. Oh, fucking!

205
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,020
The smoke machine occasionally goes off on its own

206
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,900
for no reason, and I can't be bothered to get up.

207
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,240
The paper's supposed purpose was to investigate

208
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,140
a connection between bowel disorders

209
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,900
and developmental issues in children,

210
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,980
in particular targeting signs of autism.

211
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
So first off, what's a colitis?

212
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,720
Right, uh, hold on.

213
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,980
Okay, colitis is inflammation of the colon,

214
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
one of the main symptoms of bowel diseases

215
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,560
like Crohn's disease, for example.

216
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,600
Colitis. By the way, we're gonna use words

217
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
like bowel, colon, and intestine

218
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,180
interchangeably in this video.

219
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,300
Don't let it confuse you. They're mostly the same thing.

220
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,940
If you're a doctor, pretend you didn't hear that.

221
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,140
The paper says non-specific colitis

222
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,100
because it's not looking for specific kinds of inflammation.

223
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,680
It's looking at whatever inflammation

224
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,340
these children happen to have and seeing how they compare

225
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,700
because maybe they're all linked,

226
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,000
and maybe they're even linked to the autism.

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,340
According to Wakefield, he just happened to notice

228
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,580
a lot of kids with both autism and bowel disorders,

229
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,340
and he launched the study to investigate a possible link.

230
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
Ah!

231
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,160
But what does all that have to do with vaccines?

232
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,200
I mean, surely it must have found something

233
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,300
for it to have caused all this controversy.

234
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,040
Well, allow me to list the paper's

235
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,880
highly scientific findings.

236
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,800
Some of the parents of the children in the study

237
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,260
think they remember the autism symptoms

238
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,500

Findings.

241
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,960
Onset of behavioral symptoms was associated by the parents

242

with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
until they're fairly obvious,

367
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,580
but that doesn't mean the symptoms weren't there

368
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,000
or their child wasn't autistic beforehand.

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,740
I'm bringing this up because it's important

370
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,160
to make the distinction that whenever someone describes

371
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,380
something like their child's first symptom,

372
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,040
what they are really describing is the first symptom

373
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,740
they personally noticed.

374
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,460
Here's a timeline of the first two years

375
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,620
of a child's development.

376
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,120
Statistically, the average age

377
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,780
that symptoms of autism become noticeable to parents

378
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,920
is around 12 to 18 months.

379
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,540
Children in the UK receive a dose of the MMR vaccine

380
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,700
from between 12 to 15 months.

381
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,580
Isn't it possible that these parents

382
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,660
are blaming a coincidental event?

383
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,460
You can even see evidence that this happens in the paper

384
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,880
because some of the other parents

385
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,560
blame other totally coincidental events.

386
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,020
One of them blames their child's autism on an ear infection

387
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,220
they got a week before they first noticed the symptoms.

388
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,020
Do ear infections cause autism now?

389
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,440
No.

390
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,980
No. Of course not,

391
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,720
but if it was the only other thing

392
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,600
that you remembered happening to your child,

393
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,980
you can see how someone might end up

394
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,240
assuming they're related.

395
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,900
Before this study was released,

396
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,500
there were a few very small clusters of parents

397
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
that thought vaccines caused autism or other illnesses.

398
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,040
JABS, the Justice, Awareness, and Basic Support Group,

399
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,540
wow, they really worked hard to make their name say JABS,

400
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,720
had been around for a few years beforehand.

401
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,680
The founder of JABS, Jackie Fletcher,

402
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,460
asserts to this day that her son

403
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,560
suddenly became severely autistic

404
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,800
ten days after his MMR vaccination

405
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,880
and has frequently tried to sue the government

406
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,380
and MMR manufacturers for money over it.

407
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,800
It's important to recognize that statistically,

408
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,140
even if vaccines are perfectly safe,

409
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,860
you're going to get a small amount of parents like her

410
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,880
who are convinced that vaccines are harmful

411
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,540
because they got one right before

412
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,920
something like this happened.

413
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,760
Before there was a scientific paper

414
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,460
and thousands of news pieces telling them to,

415
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
there really weren't that many parents

416
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,720
of autistic children who blamed the vaccine.

417
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,880
According to a pro-JABS piece made in May 2002

418
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,020
when the scare was happening,

419
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,440
there were thousands of members,

420
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,140
but before all that, there were only about

421
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,060
30 sets of parents at best,

422
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,780
and speaking of groups being too small

423
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,280
to be statistically meaningful,

424
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,380
another big problem, or to put it another way,

425
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,760
a small problem, is sample size.

426
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,920
Ha ha ha, please hold your applause until the end.

427
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,420
On its own, a study of a small sample size

428
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,800
like 12 children can't prove anything

429
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
about the rest of a population.

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,220
I've made this point about people drawing

431
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,840
sweeping conclusions from small studies before.

432
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,640
However, it's important to understand

433
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,100
sample size criticisms in the proper context.

434
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,900
Studies on small groups happen all the time in science

435
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,780
for a good reason.

436
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,700
They're often called pilot studies,

437
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,060
and they're useful for figuring out

438
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,640
how a bigger study should work

439
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,180
in preparation for the real thing

440
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,900
or for checking to see if there's something

441
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,720
worth looking into in the first place.

442
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,140
A fraction of parents of the tens of millions

443
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,560
of children who've had this vaccine

444
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,740
saying they think there might be a connection

445
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,780
is at best grounds to do a better study

446
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,820
on a bigger group of children to find out

447
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,120
if this connection actually exists.

448
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,860
We're going to come back to this later

449
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,780
because someone had the opportunity

450
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,960
to do one of those,

451
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,820
and what they did with that opportunity

452
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,960
is very interesting.

453
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,480
That was an awful take. Let me do that again.

454
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,780
In summary, the science is really bad.

455
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,900
It's bonkers.

456
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,280
The study even admits it doesn't prove anything at the end.

457
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,700
We did not prove an association

458
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,920
between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine

459
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,580
and the syndrome described.

460
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,300
The next sentence is hilarious.

461
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,040
Virological studies are underway

462
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,000
that may help to resolve this issue.

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,760
The issue being that they don't have any proof.

464
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,540
In science, it's expected to admit

465
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,960
the limitations of your study.

466
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,180
Papers and medical journals have high standards

467
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,440
for what constitutes solid proof.

468
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,060
However, Wakefield is using this as a shield.

469
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,620
By hiding behind the defense

470
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,660
that he hasn't claimed to prove anything,

471
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,820
he can then speculate about a lot of things

472
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,240
he hasn't proved.

473
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,000
For example, these children appear to share similar,

474
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,240
though nonspecific, bowel problems.

475
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,580
I say appeared because, well, we'll come back to that,

476
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,000
but Wakefield takes this vague collection

477
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,340
of similar things and concludes with the theory

478
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,720
that could make his career,

479
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,840
that the vaccine may cause autism

480
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,060
and it happens through the bowels.

481
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,600
We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children

482
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,480
that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.

483
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,180
In most cases, onset of symptoms

484
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,060
was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunization.

485
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,700
Further investigations are needed to examine the syndrome

486
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,280
and its possible relation to this vaccine.

487
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,160
In literally the final sentences of the paper,

488
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
Wakefield invents a new disease

489
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,860
that combines bowel disorders and autism

490
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,660
and then speculates that MMR vaccination

491
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,840
might cause the disease he just made up.

492
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,360
This is absolutely buck wild, as some would put it.

493
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,040
It's like medical fan fiction.

494
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,700
Sure, he admitted it just may be

495
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,580
and said we need more research to prove anything,

496
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,120
but now his made-up disease

497
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,420
is in a published scientific paper

498
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,460
in one of the most prestigious medical journals

499
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,380
in the world.

500
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,800
Journalists with little to no scientific knowledge

501
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,560
go on to report on this paper

502
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,060
as if it's discovering this new disease.

503
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,680
Doctors at the Royal Free Hospital

504
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,480
believe they may have discovered a link

505
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,240
between the combination vaccine

506
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,780
and a bowel disease that can progress to autism.

507
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,880
What are you talking about?

508
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,380
He admitted he didn't prove anything

509
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,420
and then wildly speculated at the end.

510
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,920
No!

511
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,220
There is one last really weird thing

512
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,000
about this paper we haven't mentioned yet,

513
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,060
which most people don't seem to mention,

514
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,600
which I find a little bit weird

515
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
and indicates that no one has actually read it.

516
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,940
Towards the end of the paper,

517
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,640
ugh, Wakefield tries to find other papers

518
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,560
that kind of support his findings,

519
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,320
so he really has to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

520
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,480
Fudenberg noted that for 15 of 20 autistic children,

521
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,800
the first symptoms developed within a week of vaccination.

522
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,720
Wow!

523
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
That's a really interesting thing to...

524
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
urk, isn't it?

525
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,240
We should probably actually go read Fudenberg's paper

526
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
and see what it has to say for itself.

527
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,160
Fudenberg's 1996 paper cited here is from

528
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,080
Biotherapy, a fringe journal for quacks

529
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,720
that actually went out of business two years later.

530
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
The paper is a pilot study on the effects

531
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,000
of a substance called

532
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,640
dialysable lymphocyte extract on children with autism.

533
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,040
In addition to alleging that several of the children

534
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,840
had become autistic within a week of getting vaccinated,

535
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,040
are you ready for this?

536
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,240
Fudenberg claimed that this extract he'd created

537
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
could cure autism.

538
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,600
Of the 22 with classic autism,

539
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,800
10 became normal in that they were mainstreamed in school

540
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,600
and clinical characteristics were fully normalized.

541
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,720
Became normal!

542
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,080
Holy shit!

543
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,400
And you want to know something funny?

544
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,520
You want to know something funny?

545
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,920
At the time that the study was published,

546
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,040
Fudenberg didn't have a medical license.

547
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,280
It was revoked the year before

548
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,120
because he was caught stealing controlled substances

549
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,440
from his job for personal use.

550
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
The South Carolina Medical Board found him guilty

551
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
of engaging in dishonorable, unethical,

552
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,040
or unprofessional conduct.

553
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,360
He admitted he'd done it in the hearing too.

554
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,400
So he got caught stealing drugs,

555
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,640
admitted it, got fired, lost all credibility,

556
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
probably wasn't even allowed within 100 yards

557
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,360
of a stethoscope, and then a year later,

558
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,240
he cured autism, according to him.

559
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,920
And you know he's trustworthy because he admitted

560
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,880
to stealing all those medical supplies.

561
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,160
What I'm trying to say here is ex-Dr. Hugh Fudenberg's paper

562
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,120
is one of the most obviously bullshit things I've ever read.

563
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,000
And Wakefield had to cite it

564
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,440
to create a precedent for his findings.

565
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
This is the best he could get.

566
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,880
You can see why it's a bit weird

567
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,280
no one brings this up, right?

568
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,840
In scientific circles,

569
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,960
everyone who read Wakefield's paper,

570
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,360
or worse, bothered to check the sources it cited,

571
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,080
had, you know, a few minor concerns.

572
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,960
It was so concerning that The Lancet published

573
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,400
in the same issue a response to the paper.

574
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Vaccine adverse events, causal or coincidental.

575
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,080
It points out numerous problems,

576
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,000
some of which we've discussed here already,

577
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,520
and has some words to say about fear-mongering

578
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,200
about vaccines like this.

579
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,680
Vaccine safety concerns,

580
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,920
such as that reported by Wakefield and colleagues,

581
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,200
may snowball into societal tragedies

582
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
when the media and the public confuse association

583
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,680
with causality and shun immunization.

584
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,720
This would be tragic because passion

585
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,280
would then conquer reason and the facts again in the UK.

586
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,400
This commentary would probably have seemed

587
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,160
darkly apocalyptic at the time,

588
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
but in retrospect,

589
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,560
it was a shockingly accurate prediction.

590
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,680
Like, they knew!

591
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,200
They fucking warned us!

592
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,920
So even before the paper was in the public eye,

593
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,560
other doctors and scientists were looking at it

594
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,920
and saying, this ain't it, chief.

595
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,640
Is that still a current reference?

596
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,040
I've aged 10 years in the last two weeks.

597
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
Time is meaningless.

598
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,600
But despite a lot of obvious concerns

599
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
and clear weaknesses,

600
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,400
Wakefield published the study anyway,

601
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,080
and then, and this is weird,

602
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,040
he immediately held a press conference about it.

603
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,280
This isn't something that anyone normally does in science,

604
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,280
especially not after publishing a five-page study

605
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,160
that admits it didn't prove anything.

606
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,440
The paper was so small and its findings so insignificant

607
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,480
that it barely even qualifies as a paper.

608
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,200
In fact, it was published in the Lancet as an early report.

609
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,520
See, the top left corner?

610
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Zoom in on it.

611
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
It's there.

612
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,400
You gotta be quicker on the drill than that.

613
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,960
Holding a press conference for this

614
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
is something you do if you want attention

615
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
for your controversial paper,

616
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
not if you're trying to do science,

617
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,600
and here's where the whole thing really started.

618
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,920
During the press conference,

619
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,480
Wakefield pretended his study had discovered

620
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
a risk so earth-shaking

621
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,880
that the government should stop using the MMR vaccine

622
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,640
and replace it with measles, mumps,

623
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,000
and rubella vaccines given separately.

624
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,960
One more case of this is too many.

625
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,400
We put children at no greater risk

626
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,240
if we dissociate those vaccines into three,

627
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,640
but we may be averting the possibility of this problem.

628
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,800
This is the moment that changed everything.

629
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,240
Wakefield told a room full of reporters

630
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,520
that based on his study,

631
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,160
he felt the MMR vaccine could be putting millions

632
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,400
of children at risk.

633
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,080
The mainstream media were in love with the notion

634
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,800
that the paper had found something,

635
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,840
so they ran with it all the way into hell.

636
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,320
♪♪

637
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,720
The paper was bad, sure,

638
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,560
but mass movements against vaccines

639
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,640
don't start because of the release of a paper.

640
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Like we discussed, people don't read papers.

641
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I didn't read it for, like, 20 years,

642
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
and you know who else didn't read it?

643
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
Every journalist who reported on it,

644
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
but when a doctor publicly says

645
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
the government is putting millions of children at risk

646
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,840
with a vaccine rolled out nationwide,

647
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,720
even if his paper's a load of old shit,

648
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,000
you gotta report on that.

649
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The possibility was too tantalizing to ignore.

650
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,240
It's really hard to get across how unavoidable

651
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
the issue was.

652
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,760
If you even glanced at a TV or a newspaper

653
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,960
in the mid-2000s,

654
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,000
it was MMR might cause autism

655
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,920
or it was Princess Diana is Still Dead.

656
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,040
Measles kills thousands of people every year,

657
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,240
but today, questions about the vaccine.

658
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,360
Vaccination could be linked to a new side effect,

659
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,920
a combination of bowel disease and autism.

660
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,040
Hundreds of articles, news pieces,

661
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
and documentaries were made

662
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,040
about the potential significance of this study.

663
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,000
They rarely show or discuss the contents

664
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,120
of the paper itself,

665
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,680
but the doctor behind it came out against MMR.

666
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
There's a potential link.

667
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
There's a potential link, everybody.

668
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,560
And do you know what happens when every news resource

669
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,840
is screaming about the potential risks of a vaccine?

670
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,480
You make millions of people terrified

671
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
to vaccinate their children.

672
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,920
I was growing up during the MMR scare,

673
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,800
and the main thing I remember from the TV news

674
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,880
at that time was big shots of pointy needles

675
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,760
and children screaming as they get given an injection

676
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
and ominous voiceovers saying,

677
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
oh, these vaccines might be dangerous.

678
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,080
It's almost like TV deliberately scares people

679
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,720
for ratings because that's how this works.

680
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
That's the entire point.

681
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,440
If you want to know why thousands of parents

682
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,640
think MMR gave their children autism,

683
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,120
it's not because they came to that conclusion on their own.

684
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,680
We've seen how before all of this reporting happened,

685
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,080
only a teeny tiny minority of parents

686
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,520
made the connection between autism and the vaccine.

687
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,320
They could only find seven parents of autistic children

688
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,920
who blamed MMR in the original study even.

689
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,720
The only thing that changed was how many news outlets

690
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,160
were telling everyone the vaccine might cause it.

691
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,000
After years of the media telling them

692
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,080
it could have been the jab,

693
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,480
some parents started to believe it.

694
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
The symptoms started to appear when he was two,

695
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,960
soon after he had his MMR.

696
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,520
This is the age at which autism usually develops,

697
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,160
but his parents don't believe it's coincidence.

698
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,280
His parents didn't believe it was a coincidence

699
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,360
because every news resource was telling them

700
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,400
it might have something to do with the vaccine,

701
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,960
and trusting that the media had done the work

702
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,800
and knew what they were talking about,

703
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,000
they believed what they were being told.

704
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,320
The end result of publications and broadcasts like this

705
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,080
was a lot of concerned parents,

706
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,280
a lot of unvaccinated children,

707
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
and a whole lot of new cases of measles.

708
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,200
With inoculation rates falling to dangerous levels.

709
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,240
In Ireland, the debate over MMR has been fueled

710
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,480
still further by a measles outbreak

711
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,280
which killed three children.

712
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,760
Whatever the official evidence,

713
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,640
which rejected a link between MMR and autism,

714
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,200
fewer parents were prepared to take a risk.

715
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,680
I wonder why that might be.

716
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,840
Could it be because every time you turned on the television,

717
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,400
there's footage of a screaming child

718
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,520
with a needle in its arm?

719
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,360
Once literally every other doctor had come out saying,

720
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,600
look, there's no proof. Please stop doing this,

721
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
a lot of journalists got really defensive suddenly

722
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,480
and started putting out pieces like,

723
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,560
no, I will not stop reporting scaremongering bullshit.

724
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,840
Wait, the same journalist wrote both of these.

725
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,760
She just spent like six months of her career

726
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
complaining about people criticizing her.

727
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,400
Amazing.

728
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,240
So what was Andrew Wakefield doing during all this?

729
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Well, he was getting interviewed nonstop

730
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,240
and having clips played in almost all of these news pieces.

731
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
He was like a celebrity,

732
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,440
especially to the growing list of parents

733
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,520
newly convinced by the media's reporting

734
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,160
that he'd discovered why their children had autism.

735
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,000
For a couple of years, Andrew Wakefield

736
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,560
was the sort of guy who you filmed in slow motion

737
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,360
in black and white.

738
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,240
Holy shi-

739
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,280
Wakefield used his time in the spotlight

740
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,240
to spread even more doubt about MMR

741
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,360
and continue to repeat the recommendation

742
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,920
that parents get separate vaccines instead.

743
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,400
At the press conference, in interviews in the aftermath,

744
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
and four whole times on a 23-minute videotape

745
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,520
he sent to journalists,

746
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,440
he claims he thinks separate vaccines

747
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,160
would avoid the risk of autism.

748
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
Andrew Wakefield says he appealed

749
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,360
to the chief medical officer more than six months ago

750
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,880
to give worried parents the option of the single vaccine.

751
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,520
My recommendation has been

752
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,560
that children should continue to be vaccinated,

753
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800
but to separate the vaccines,

754
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,680
there is sufficient anxiety in my own mind

755
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
over the safety, the long-term safety of the polyvalent,

756
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,840
that is the MMR vaccination in combination,

757
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,600
that I think that it should be suspended

758
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,040
in favor of the single vaccines.

759
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,120
There is sufficient anxiety in my own mind

760
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,200
that it would be sensible to divide them

761
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
into separate doses.

762
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,040
There is sufficient anxiety

763
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,440
that the parents must have a choice

764
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
of how they protect their children.

765
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,680
It's really kind of interesting

766
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,200
that while the modern anti-vaccine movement

767
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,280
insists that all vaccines are dangerous in some way,

768
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,600
the guy who started the fear and anxiety

769
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,640
that led to this was pro-vaccine.

770
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,560
We advocate vaccination.

771
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,360
This is not anti-vaccine in any way.

772
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
He was really specific about the fact

773
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,800
that he thought parents should keep vaccinating,

774
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,280
just that they should use alternatives to MMR.

775
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,600
The single vaccines are likely in this context

776
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,280
to be safer.

777
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,320
Remember that disease he speculated about

778
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
at the end of his paper?

779
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,760
That there might be some kind of bowel disorder

780
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,680
caused by MMR that then leads to autism?

781
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,640
This came up in the media a lot as well.

782
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,800
Could the NMR jab be causing a strange,

783
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,880
new kind of bowel disease

784
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
that was turning the children autistic?

785
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,840
Measles, mumps, and rubella given together

786
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,240
may be too much for the immune system

787
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,400
of some children to handle.

788
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,960
There is a bowel disease, a new syndrome

789
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,520
associated with regressive autism,

790
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,200
and that that may be related to MMR.

791
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,680
Eventually, he even came up with a name for it.

792
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,840
Autistic enterocolitis.

793
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,320
Wakefield's theory, when he tries to explain it,

794
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,760
is that the almost-dead measles virus

795
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
present in the MMR vaccine

796
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,320
can get stuck in the intestine...somehow,

797
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,760
causing all that inflammation

798
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,600
they apparently found in the study.

799
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,880
More on that later.

800
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,360
Which leads to it not digesting certain foods

801
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,200
like bread and milk properly,

802
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
turning them into, his words,

803
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,240
a morphine-like substance

804
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,400
which then leaks out of the bowel

805
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,080
and into the brain, causing autism.

806
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Morphine-like substances from the gut

807
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
that you and I produce in our diet

808
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
from milk and wheat

809
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,320
are actually getting access through that leaky gut

810
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
into the developing brain.

811
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,720
This theory is, uh, very strange.

812
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,760
One of the many strange things about it

813
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,480
is that it specifically implicates

814
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
the measles part of the vaccine.

815
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,520
If measles, when it's in a vaccine,

816
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,840
can cause a syndrome that leads to autism,

817
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,080
how could you possibly be so certain

818
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,760
that the separate vaccine for measles would be safe?

819
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
The risk of this particular syndrome developing

820
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,680
is related to the combined vaccine,

821
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,680
the MMR, rather than the single vaccines.

822
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
Okay, sure, but why?

823
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,560
On what basis are you saying that, Andy?

824
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,360
How could a doctor so easily make that recommendation?

825
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,360
And it may be that giving the measles on its own

826
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,680
reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing.

827
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,080
He just keeps saying it.

828
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,120
My opinion, again,

829
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
is that the monovalent, the single vaccines,

830
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,000
measles, mumps, and rubella,

831
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,040
are likely in this context to be safer

832
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,800
than the polyvalent vaccine.

833
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,440
That's the MMR vaccine.

834
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,760
There's actually a real reason

835
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,040
why he recommended the separate vaccine so much.

836
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
Uh, we'll get to that later.

837
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,040
Here's the one example I could find

838
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,400
of an interviewer asking him to explain themself.

839
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,640
But even supposing the measles element of the MMR vaccine

840
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,600
had deposited the virus in the intestinal tissue

841
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,760
of these children,

842
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,800
a single jab of measles might do the same.

843
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,640
Theoretically, it might.

844
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,720
But you're advocating a jab,

845
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,000
single jabs instead of MMR?

846
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,920
I said theoretically.

847
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,240
Oh, only theoretically.

848
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,880
Well, that's fine, then.

849
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,240
What a great scientist.

850
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,160
But if you say it may do,

851
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,520
then how can you advocate a single jab of measles,

852
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,720
even if there's only a theoretical possibility

853
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,120
that it might damage a child?

854
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,720
While that question mark exists,

855
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,040
at the very least,

856
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,080
parents deserve a choice of how they protect their children

857
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,240
against these infections,

858
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,480
whether it be with the MMR vaccine

859
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
or whether it is with the single vaccine.

860
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,680
He always finds a way to pivot back

861
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,120
to how in the midst of all of these questions and concerns,

862
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
which he started,

863
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,760
parents should at least have the option

864
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,040
of a separate vaccine.

865
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,280
Honestly, you'd think he was some kind of salesman

866
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,680
for alternative vaccines.

867
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,560
Autistic enterocolitis is not

868
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,760
and has never been accepted as real by gastroenterology,

869
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,280
the field specializing in the stomach and intestines,

870
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,680
but an ordinary person, or worse, a journalist,

871
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,160
might not understand it enough

872
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,800
to know that it doesn't make sense.

873
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,800
So, of course, it got reported as an interesting new idea.

874
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,760
It was a bold and controversial theory.

875
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,520
That's an interesting choice of words.

876
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,440
This piece by that really defensive lady,

877
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,120
Melanie Phillips, one of the most well-paid journalists

878
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,680
in Britain at the time, is still continuing to spread it

879
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,800
in this very article about being criticized for spreading it.

880
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,760
She calls it a unique gut-brain disease.

881
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,640
When you imagine a new disease,

882
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,680
of course it's gonna sound unique, Melanie.

883
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,720
No red flags popping up around the fact

884
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,360
that no disease has ever functioned like this before?

885
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
No? Fucking hell.

886
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,720
This completely unproved, unique, bold,

887
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
and controversial theory was irresistible to Phillips,

888
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,720
a bigot of the year award-winning writer

889
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
famous for also denying climate change,

890
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,540
calling Obama an Islamist,

891
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:07,000
describing a group of liberal Jews as Jews for genocide,

892
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,340
and opposing both Irish independence and gay rights,

893
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,140
which she dismissed as an attack on the traditional family

894
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,800
by cultural Marxism.

895
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,680
It's not shocking that Phillips was wrong about MMR.

896
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,520
It's her job to be wrong about everything.

897
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,220
The truly shocking thing about this is that for once,

898
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,440
the entire rest of the British media

899
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,060
were on the same side as her,

900
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,320
uncritically regurgitating everything Wakefield said

901
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,700
to millions of people.

902
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
This completely irresponsible reporting

903
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,780
caused fear, vaccine hesitancy,

904
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,900
kick-started an anti-vaccine movement

905
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,400
that's still here today,

906
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,020
and resulted in the deaths of children

907
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,780
from completely preventable diseases.

908
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,900
And that's the tea, sis.

909
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,040
There's real liquid in there. I'm not doing a bit.

910
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
I will spill it if I try and show it to you.

911
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,040
I'm sorry, but there's, look.

912
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,660
See? It's real.

913
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,880
It's not tea, though. It's coffee.

914
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
I'm not a farmer.

915
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,900
Perhaps the only thing more frustrating

916
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,240
than seeing the media do everything it can

917
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,820
to push pseudoscience

918
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,040
was how everyone actually addressed the topic of autism.

919
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,080
Autism is a complex condition

920
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,000
we still don't fully understand,

921
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,380
with many variations in symptoms and severity,

922
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
but the media never mentioned that.

923
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,760
They deliberately went looking for the most severe

924
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,220
and extreme cases they could find

925
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,060
and then filmed them to exploit for television.

926
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,360
Children who couldn't communicate verbally

927
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,020
or had severe physical disabilities as well.

928
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,100
The intent to make the MMR question

929
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,980
as serious as possible

930
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,200
resulted in an almost pornographic obsession

931
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,620
with suffering children.

932
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,700
They went out of their way to portray autism

933
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
as a horrific tragedy

934
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,120
that it's worth risking a disease to avoid.

935
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,920
And yeah, measles is a disease.

936
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,840
Like, it kills people.

937
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
It can cause incredibly severe complications

938
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,500
that are with people for life.

939
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,580
We as a society are no longer really aware

940
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
of just how dangerous measles can be

941
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,140
because we don't see all those complications

942
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,040
as much because of vaccinations.

943
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,600
Measles, mumps, and rubella are legitimately dangerous

944
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,480
and potentially life-threatening diseases,

945
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,440
and it says a lot about how we think about neurodivergence

946
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,740
that it's worth risking that

947
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,980
to avoid being autistic to some people.

948
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,020
Hell, I was in Waitrose a few months ago.

949
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,500
I never shop there, but I pretend to

950
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
so I can use their unnecessarily massive parking space,

951
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,920
and I saw them selling a magazine

952
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,500
with this on the cover.

953
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,260
Reignite your child's brain

954
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,840
with alternative treatments.

955
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,720
What they mean there is alternatives to treatment.

956
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,060
This is not how a healthy society

957
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,260
discusses its people.

958
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,060
Autistic people have to navigate a world

959
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,480
that refuses to accommodate them in the slightest

960
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,440
to the point they're regularly confronted

961
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,940
with the idea other people think their brain has gone out.

962
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,500
Come on, get it together, Waitrose.

963
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,000
You're the up-market, upper-class,

964
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,320
rich people supermarket.

965
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,700
You're supposed to be the smartest.

966
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,000
What's going on there?

967
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,580
The only thing that needs igniting here

968
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,180
is your fucking shops.

969
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,340
Did we get clearance to say that?

970
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Okay, that was a joke?

971
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,140
While the MMR scale was at its height,

972
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,980
the entire media landscape was a unified front

973
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,720
in saying, wrongly,

974
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,320
that autism is the worst fate imaginable for a child

975
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,320
and much worse than dying of measles,

976
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,160
so a lot of kids didn't get vaccinated.

977
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,700
Then again, it wasn't all bad.

978
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,500
Some parents just vaccinated their children

979
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,320
for measles, mumps, and rubella separately,

980
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,920
which, by the way, was pretty expensive.

981
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,340
But they don't want their child to have MMR.

982
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,420
They'd rather pay for single vaccines

983
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,080
at 60 pounds a shot.

984
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,760
60 quid?

985
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,600
By jolly, governor!

986
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,680
Imagine millions of parents wanting

987
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,540
an expensive alternative vaccine

988
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,880
because all of a sudden a study had come out

989
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,640
saying that the regular one might cause autism

990
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,340
and a prominent scientist was cautioning against it.

991
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,560
He'd urged the government to split MMR

992
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,180
into separate vaccines.

993
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,100
Giving the measles on its own

994
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,060
reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing.

995
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,200
Why, whoever was producing and selling

996
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,360
the alternative vaccine would be in for a fucking goldmine,

997
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,320
wouldn't they?

998
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,660
They'd make an absolute fortune.

999
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,840
Here's a funny thing about that.

1000
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Part four.

1001
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,220
Andrew Wakefield is a lying conman

1002
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,360
who wanted your money.

1003
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,680
Oh, sorry. That puts me at risk of libel, doesn't it?

1004
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,900
Hold on. Let's revise that.

1005
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,820
Part four.

1006
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,940
In my opinion, Andrew Wakefield is a lying conman

1007
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,020
who wanted your money.

1008
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,120
So we have Wakefield's paper

1009
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,740
and the implication that MMR might cause autism in there

1010
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,240
and you have Wakefield saying,

1011
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,860
I ain't got several vaccines.

1012
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,660
You and I can both agree

1013
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,280
that there might be a conflict of interest there

1014
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,880
if, if Wakefield was selling an alternative vaccine, right?

1015
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,880
We can all agree that would be fucked up, wouldn't it?

1016
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,960
Here's Wakefield's patent on an alternative measles vaccine.

1017
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,720
This little piece of shit was filed six months

1018
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,220
before the study was released.

1019
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,020
So, uh, what's going on there, Andy?

1020
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,220
Something you want to tell us, buddy?

1021
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,680
It's time to introduce someone new to the story.

1022
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,680
Brian Deer is an award-winning investigative reporter

1023
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,960
with a long history of exposing medical fraud,

1024
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,060
specializing in the pharmaceutical industry,

1025
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,440
and the perfect sort of person

1026
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,980
for the middle of this health scare.

1027
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,800
Deer was one of the few journalists

1028
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,900
who didn't simply accept what Wakefield

1029
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,440
was saying at face value

1030
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,780
and thought to dig a little deeper into the study

1031
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,360
and what he was really up to.

1032
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,660
Deer called the hospital Wakefield worked at

1033
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,360
with some basic questions,

1034
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
the kind that Wakefield apparently

1035
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,500
wasn't used to getting.

1036
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,120
Within three hours of doing so,

1037
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,180
Wakefield's publicist, you know,

1038
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,520
doctors hiring publicists to promote them.

1039
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,780
That happens all the time,

1040
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,360
had made a complaint about Deer

1041
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,020
to the newspaper he worked at.

1042
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,520
Deer, of course, only grew more interested.

1043
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,780
His eventual 2004 documentary,

1044
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,400
MMR What They Didn't Tell You,

1045
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,580
is the better documentary I mentioned before,

1046
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,080
and by better, I mean blew the doors

1047
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,960
off of Andrew Wakefield's whole scheme.

1048
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,340
It was Deer who discovered Wakefield's patent.

1049
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,260
Let's take a look at that patent now.

1050
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,540
The present invention relates to a new vaccine

1051
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,760
for the prevention and or prophylaxis

1052
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,020
against measles virus infection.

1053
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,640
Now, I'm not a big-time science-talking fancy guy,

1054
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,480
but this sounds a little bit like a measles vaccine.

1055
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,020
The patent was submitted in June 1997,

1056
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,240
so Wakefield had done most of the study

1057
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,020
and then rushed to patent a method

1058
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,740
of making a competing vaccine he could sell later.

1059
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,080
And guess what? If you look closely at the patent,

1060
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,200
you can see a familiar name on there next to Wakefield's.

1061
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,080
Remember Hugh Fudenberg?

1062
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,500
The quack who thought he could cure autism

1063
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,840
after having his medical license revoked?

1064
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,500
His name is also on the patent!

1065
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,720
He's credited as a co-inventor of this vaccine!

1066
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,340
Fudenberg's company,

1067
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,100
the very real and legitimate-sounding

1068
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,520
Neuro-Immunotherapeutics Research Foundation,

1069
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,220
is listed on the patent along with a business address.

1070
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,860
In the documentary where he revealed

1071
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,220
the existence of this patent,

1072
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,360
Brian Deer went to that address to try to find Fudenberg

1073
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,780
and discovered the company had already shut down

1074
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,980
and the building had become a real estate agency.

1075
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,860
Looking that address up now, it appears to be a hairdresser's.

1076
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,320
Doesn't look like one of America's

1077
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,900
premier research foundations.

1078
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,160
When he did find him, Deer asked Fudenberg

1079
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,860
about the whole thought-he-could-cure-autism thing

1080
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,540
and, uh, well, I, uh, ha, ha, ha.

1081
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,700
Do you believe that autism can be cured?

1082
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,160
Yes.

1083
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,460
Cured? Yes.

1084
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,580
It's cheap, it's oral, no injections.

1085
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,300
One pill a day, every other day for three or six months.

1086
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,860
And where, where does that come from?

1087
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,200
From my bone marrow.

1088
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
From your own personal bone marrow?

1089
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,400
Yeah.

1090
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,200
I mean, that's, that seems extraordinary.

1091
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Yeah.

1092
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,420
♪♪

1093
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,960
Just to quickly remind you, this man is the co-inventor

1094
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,120
of Wakefield's alternative vaccine.

1095
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,040
You know what? You got me.

1096
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
Vaccines might be dangerous.

1097
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,460
And just in case it wasn't extremely obvious

1098
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,680
what a hasty fucking scam Wackyfield

1099
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,960
and his one friend who agreed with him

1100
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,180
were putting together,

1101
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,060
Fudenberg's name is spelled wrong on the patent.

1102
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,280
The other inventor of this vaccine

1103
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,620
besides Andrew Jeremy Wakefield

1104
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:24,080
is one Hugh Fundenberg.

1105
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,820
Nice one, Jeremy.

1106
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,420
By 1999, Wakefield was the director

1107
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,780
of several medical businesses,

1108
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,160
Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Limited

1109
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,920
and Carmel Healthcare Limited,

1110
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,660
named after his wife at the time.

1111
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,760
She later divorced him.

1112
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,500
He started shopping these companies around

1113
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,920
for investors based on the very convenient patent

1114
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,700
he'd got right before the health scare he caused.

1115
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,120
But in addition to the vaccine,

1116
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,080
Wakefield had another product in mind.

1117
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,720
If autistic enterocolitis turned out to be real,

1118
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,920
big if there, I know,

1119
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,420
that would mean there would be a completely new market

1120
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,640
in the form of testing for this new disease.

1121
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
Wakefield planned on producing and selling

1122
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,440
diagnostic kits meant to test for autistic enterocolitis.

1123
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,900
A private and confidential prospectus

1124
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,860
for potential investors acquired by Brian Deer claimed,

1125
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,720
It is estimated that the initial market

1126
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,860
for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing

1127
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,400
of patients with AE, autistic enterocolitis,

1128
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,600
from both the UK and the USA.

1129
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,520
Describing the target audiences as,

1130
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,780
Parent groups and lawyers

1131
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,700
representing affected individuals.

1132
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,540
And,

1133
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,040
Major pharmaceutical companies.

1134
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,820
These prospectuses also calculated

1135
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,540
how much these businesses would be worth.

1136
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,840
It is estimated that by year three,

1137
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,880
income from this testing could be about

1138
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,280
£3,300,000,

1139
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,740
rising to about £28 million.

1140
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,860
Adjusting for inflation,

1141
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,380
that upper estimate is about $72 million.

1142
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,700
If you think that's bad,

1143
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,160
years earlier he estimated a much larger number

1144
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,760
to the for-profit branch of the Royal Free Medical School.

1145
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,080
£72.5 million per year.

1146
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,040
Almost $200 million in today's money.

1147
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,840
In an inventor school investor meeting document

1148
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,760
that Deer obtained,

1149
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,640
Wakefield teased they could charge

1150
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
premium prices for the technology

1151
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,980
he intended to develop.

1152
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,900
Wakefield also became director of a third business,

1153
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,400
Unigenetics Limited, in the Irish Republic.

1154
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,860
Wakefield applied for and was successfully given

1155
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,700
£800,000, more than $2 million today,

1156
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,380
in government funding to begin developing the test.

1157
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,420
And this is all on top of how much money

1158
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,800
Wakefield would get if he managed to get the funding

1159
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,880
to manufacture his alternative vaccine.

1160
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,220
Companies like Axcan Pharma in Canada

1161
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,060
were paying to fly him out to discuss his business plans.

1162
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
According to Brian Deer,

1163
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,220
he was also negotiating a consultancy

1164
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,680
with Johnson & Johnson and developing connections

1165
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,060
with both Merck and SmithKlineBeachum.

1166
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,060
This guy was sure he was gonna be rolling in money.

1167
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,720
I wonder if this might point to a financial incentive

1168
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,360
to discredit MMR.

1169
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,860
Hmmmmm...

1170
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,360
Ah!

1171
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,380
Watching Wakefield repeatedly push

1172
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,440
for getting alternative vaccines just in case

1173
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,400
is really chilling to watch now.

1174
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,280
You have to watch him sit there and create demand

1175
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,400
for his planned future products,

1176
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,620
and no one watching knows what he's up to.

1177
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,120
They think he's a doctor just asking questions about MMR.

1178
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,960
No wonder he wasn't anti-vaccine.

1179
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,660
He wanted you to buy his!

1180
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,840
That said, there were a few roadblocks

1181
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,500
to the success of these businesses.

1182
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,720
The first is that autistic enterocolitis

1183
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,880
is a fake disease he just made up,

1184
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,800
which means it's very hard to invent a test for it.

1185
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,380
In Ireland, at Unigenetics,

1186
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,880
Wakefield brought in a colleague,

1187
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,700
John O'Leary, to try to get the testing kits to work.

1188
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,880
O'Leary claimed his test could find measles virus

1189
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,080
in the bowels of autistic children.

1190
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,680
He'd found measles virus in most of the samples

1191
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,760
he'd tested from children with autism and bowel disease.

1192
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,460
This is the closest Wakefield or any of his cohorts

1193
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,920
would ever come to proving autistic enterocolitis exists,

1194
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,680
but this quickly fell apart.

1195
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,480
Every other lab that tried to recreate his results

1196
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,640
found the same thing.

1197
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,680
The only way his equipment could get the results

1198
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,860
he was getting is if there was contamination

1199
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,000
or if his machine had been calibrated wrong.

1200
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,820
It turned out later it was both.

1201
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,280
Test tubes that didn't have measles in them

1202
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,080
tested positive for measles.

1203
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,460
O'Leary had an 11.1% stake in Immunospecifics,

1204
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,420
the company which would be selling the kits,

1205
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,220
which would have made him incredibly rich

1206
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,920
if the test had eventually worked,

1207
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,640
but strangely he stopped being able to get these results

1208
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,920
once people started scrutinizing his work.

1209
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,880
So that's 800,000 pounds of taxpayer money

1210
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
down the drain.

1211
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,260
♪ ♪

1212
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,380
The second problem was that potential investors

1213
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,220
who looked into his alternative vaccine

1214
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,560
even slightly would notice that the guy who co-invented it

1215
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
was a doctor who had just been fired

1216
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,060
and thought he could cure autism

1217
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,760
using his fucking bone marrow!

1218
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,280
So I guess what I'm saying is there was a slight delay

1219
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,240
in finding people willing to fund it.

1220
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,240
Finally, as Wakefield tried to launch his businesses,

1221
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,620
there was a critical shake-up

1222
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,280
at the hospital he was working at.

1223
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,660
While many of the Royal Free Hospital's higher-ups

1224
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,160
were fans of Wakefield's controversial paper

1225
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,860
and the attention it brought to the hospital

1226
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,280
and medical school, and some of them

1227
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,000
were even involved directly with his new businesses,

1228
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,660
in late 1999 the school got a new head of medicine

1229
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,000
named Mark Pepys.

1230
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,880
Pepys was a specialist in fields close to what Wakefield

1231
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,720
was speculating about in his papers,

1232
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,760
and like most scientists who knew anything

1233
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,380
about the subject could tell something was up.

1234
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,600
Wakefield was sent a letter voicing concerns

1235
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,920
about the scientifically unjustified basis

1236
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,480
of the work the companies were doing

1237
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,340
along with the incredibly obvious

1238
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,380
conflicts of interest happening here.

1239
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,100
You know, you kind of have a vested interest

1240
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,760
in proving a link between vaccines,

1241
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,140
bowel disorders, and autism

1242
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,940
when you intend to make millions of pounds off it.

1243
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,900
Even then, they volunteered to support Wakefield more,

1244
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,400
but not in the way he wanted.

1245
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
Remember that thing I said about pilot studies?

1246
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,940
I'm sure you do. You have a good memory.

1247
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,120
I really respect that about you.

1248
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,860
They offered to continue employing him,

1249
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,120
but only if he undertook a new, much bigger study

1250
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,160
to actually explore the original study's findings properly.

1251
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,220
He was offered help with a study on 150 patients

1252
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,720
to confirm what he had only really speculated about

1253
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,600
so far with a study of 12.

1254
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,780
Good scientific practice now demands that you and others

1255
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,660
seek to confirm or refute robustly, reliably,

1256
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,440
and above all, reproducibly,

1257
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,320
the possible causal relationships

1258
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,200
between MMR vaccination and autism,

1259
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,460
autistic enterocolitis, and inflammatory bowel disease

1260
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,820
that you have postulated.

1261
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,240
Autistic enterocolitis is in quotes.

1262
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,700
They don't believe him. It's great.

1263
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,660
This would be any legitimate scientist's dream.

1264
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,300
The freedom and support to fully explore a hypothesis

1265
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,680
and discover the truth.

1266
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,960
Wakefield agreed to perform the study,

1267
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,840
but then he never actually did it.

1268
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,420
Pepys would later go on to say Wakefield was

1269
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,260
a wanker and a fraud.

1270
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,940
Eventually, in 2001, after repeatedly ignoring calls

1271
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,980
to do the study he'd agreed to do,

1272
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,260
he was told to leave.

1273
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,980
Check out this article all about...

1274
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,480
Oh, I love journalism.

1275
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,760
Last November, Andrew Wakefield

1276
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,020
left the Royal Free Hospital by mutual agreement.

1277
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,640
Capitalizing on his perceived reputation with the public

1278
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,320
as a man who had discovered a link

1279
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,560
between vaccines and autism, Wakefield said...

1280
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,060
I have been asked to go

1281
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,820
because my research results are unpopular.

1282
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,780
This was meant to sound conspiratorial,

1283
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,360
like, they let me go because I'm making MMR look bad,

1284
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,820
but it seems like he was just unpopular with people

1285
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,660
because they could tell he was a fraud and a wanker.

1286
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,200
At this point, Wakefield's career

1287
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,380
as far as real medicine was concerned

1288
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,980
was over and his businesses failed to get off the ground

1289
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,320
because he no longer had any legitimacy left.

1290
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,820
What pharmaceutical company or other investor

1291
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,580
is gonna give money to a doctor who just got fired

1292
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,700
for refusing to prove the thing he's trying

1293
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,960
to get funding for even exists?

1294
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,920
In 2003, Deer's investigation was in a full swing

1295
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,700
and beginning to uncover all of this.

1296
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,800
He also made a really interesting discovery

1297
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,500
about something that took place during the original study.

1298
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,960
You know that whole autistic enterocolitis thing?

1299
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,100
Both his theories about MMR's danger

1300
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,320
and his new businesses making testing kits

1301
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,660
for the disease rested on being able to find

1302
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,620
the measles virus in the intestines

1303
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,780
of children with autism.

1304
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,000
The question we've been asking,

1305
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,780
is measles virus present

1306
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,920
in the intestine of these children?

1307
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,080
The BBC documentary covered this search extensively

1308
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,760
with Wakefield saying in an interview

1309
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,620
that proving it was there would require

1310
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,640
finding the RNA of the virus in tissue samples.

1311
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,180
The gold standard now is to find

1312
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,800
the gene of the virus in there.

1313
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,060
The big deal here is if Wakefield can't find

1314
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,560
the gene of the virus, then his theory is wrong.

1315
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,980
In these interviews, Wakefield is trying to imply

1316
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,140
that they've only just started looking for the virus,

1317
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,100
so they haven't found it yet, but that's okay.

1318
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,660
They've only just started looking, right?

1319
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,660
This turned out to be a lie.

1320
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,860
Deer discovered that Wakefield had already looked for it

1321
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,000
and it's not there.

1322
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,780
Dr. Nick Chadwick worked on Wakefield's paper

1323
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,580
and was a specialist on methods

1324
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,420
of finding measles RNA in tissue samples.

1325
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,120
Wakefield actually helped co-author some of his work,

1326
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,700
so of course, Wakefield had Chadwick look

1327
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,980
for measles RNA in the tissue samples

1328
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,700
taken from the children in the study.

1329
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,540
These were the children Wakefield was sure

1330
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,660
must have measles somewhere in their guts

1331
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,700
since he was blaming their autism on it.

1332
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,540
However, when he looked,

1333
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,160
he never found any measles whatsoever.

1334
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,460
Did you find measles virus in those children?

1335
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,000
No.

1336
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,800
No single case did I find any measles virus

1337
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
in those children.

1338
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,220
This means that Wakefield already knew

1339
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
before he even published the paper

1340
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,040
that measles couldn't be found

1341
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,780
in the guts of autistic children.

1342
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,460
Dr. Wakefield's theory was that it was measles virus itself

1343
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,380
that was responsible for a bowel disease

1344
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,720
and then leading on to some kinds of autism

1345
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,260
and you found no measles virus.

1346
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,260
That's correct.

1347
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,800
The final published version of the 1998 study

1348
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,840
doesn't have Dr. Chadwick's name on it

1349
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,600
even though he did a lot of work for it.

1350
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,940
Chadwick later wrote in a signed declaration

1351
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,600
that he specifically asked for his name

1352
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,900
to be left off the paper

1353
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,780
because he wasn't comfortable with how Wakefield

1354
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,380
was still pushing his theory

1355
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,580
even though he'd found zero positive tests for measles.

1356
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,880
By this point, he was already planning

1357
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,140
to launch a business selling testing kits

1358
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,180
based on this theory,

1359
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,640
so he ignored the work in his own lab

1360
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,560
that disproved him and kept saying

1361
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,600
he thought measles could cause a bowel disease

1362
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,600
that leads to autism

1363
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,260
and kept looking there for measles

1364
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,680
for years afterwards.

1365
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,100
The BBC documentary is about his hunt

1366
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,240
for the measles virus

1367
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,980
because even four years after launching his paper,

1368
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,860
he still hadn't found anything else

1369
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,320
to back up what he was saying.

1370
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,740
I actually have to give some credit now

1371
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,080
to this BBC documentary.

1372
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,900
Even though they mostly side with Wakefield

1373
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,320
and assume he's going to find the proof soon,

1374
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,200
there is one segment where the interviewer's like,

1375
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
wait a second.

1376
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,040
Shouldn't you have proved it

1377
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,920
before you said it?

1378
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,160
As I say, proof may be 10, 15 years away

1379
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,660
in terms of definitive scientific proof.

1380
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,760
So shouldn't you have waited?

1381
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,760
No.

1382
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,300
Obviously after discovering all this,

1383
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,180
Brian Deer had even more questions for Wakefield,

1384
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,380
which Wakefield was continuing to avoid.

1385
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,580
I've been trying now to speak with him for a year.

1386
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,160
We even wrote,

1387
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,960
but he didn't reply.

1388
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,300
Deer eventually just went to an autism conference

1389
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,540
Wakefield was speaking at.

1390
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,920
After his presentation,

1391
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,800
Deer approached him with questions.

1392
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,460
Dr. Wakefield, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1393
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,040
Brian Deer, Channel 4 Television.

1394
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,180
Um, could I talk to you about your research, sir,

1395
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,680
and your, uh, commercial ambitions?

1396
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Excuse me.

1397
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,300
There's something kind of cathartic

1398
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,760
about just how guilty Wakefield acts here.

1399
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,440
Like, he's happily hanging around after his talk,

1400
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,300
casually answering questions from concerned parents

1401
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,420
and other reporters,

1402
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,340
and then the instant he recognizes Brian Deer,

1403
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,300
the guy he's been actively avoiding for over a year,

1404
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,100
he turns and leaves the room as fast as he can.

1405
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,600
Wakefield's only defense

1406
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,680
against his clear financial incentive

1407
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,900
to discredit MMR is to run away

1408
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,360
and hope you leave him alone,

1409
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,060
and since Deer clearly wasn't doing that,

1410
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,940
Wakefield decided to escalate.

1411
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,520
A few months after this footage

1412
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,120
of him heroically running away like a baby

1413
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,960
from basic inquiry was broadcast,

1414
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,120
Wacky Andy filed a defamation lawsuit

1415
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,420
against Channel 4, who produced the documentary,

1416
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,880
the Sunday Times, who published some of Deer's reporting,

1417
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,420
and additionally, he sued Brian Deer's personal website,

1418
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,180
briandeer.com.

1419
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,720
Can you imagine being that petty?

1420
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,480
In 2004, 10 of the paper's original 13 authors

1421
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,680
came forward to publicly retract

1422
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,760
the interpretation section of the paper.

1423
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,940
Half a decade after its publication,

1424
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,480
a vast majority of the people

1425
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,340
who worked with Wakefield on his paper

1426
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,800
have gone on record to say

1427
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,840
they think his conclusions are bollocks.

1428
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,400
At this point, Wakefield's study's coffin

1429
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,140
has fallen through the floor

1430
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,060
from the sheer weight of all the nails

1431
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,280
that have been hammered in it.

1432
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,560
So that's the foundational study

1433
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,660
of the anti-vaccine movement.

1434
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,200
A hack fraud's bullshit paper

1435
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,660
claiming that a handful of parents

1436
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,620
know better than all doctors

1437
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,280
so he could sell an alternative competing vaccine

1438
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,880
that he'd patented,

1439
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,340
which he thought he was gonna make millions selling.

1440
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,340
The evidence against the movement

1441
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,180
can't get much worse than that, can it?

1442
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,860
That was a joke.

1443
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,780
Part five, it gets much worse.

1444
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,280
Brian Deer didn't stop there.

1445
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,060
Wakefield was trying to sue him to get him to stop digging,

1446
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:57,980
and guess what?

1447
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,480
One of the first rules of investigative reporting

1448
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,200
is that if they try and sue you for finding things out,

1449
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,940
you're probably onto something.

1450
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,560
I mean, he brought me into the story

1451
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,560
by virtue of the fact that years ago he sued me.

1452
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,940
He discovered that two years before the paper

1453
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,360
was published, Wakefield had been hired

1454
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,700
by a lawyer to conduct the study.

1455
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,160
The lawyer, Richard Barr,

1456
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,360
had realized there was potentially millions

1457
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,320
and millions of pounds in bringing

1458
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,200
a class-action lawsuit against MMR manufacturers

1459
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,320
on behalf of parents of autistic children,

1460
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,200
but since there was no actual evidence

1461
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,460
the vaccine did this,

1462
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,960
he paid Wakefield to find some.

1463
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,100
Wakefield charged Barr £150 an hour

1464
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,980
for the time he spent working on the study,

1465
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,280
eventually totaling over £435,000.

1466
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,740
In today's money, that's more than $1.1 million.

1467
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,540
This was more than eight times his yearly salary

1468
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,080
at his job at the hospital.

1469
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,280
Six months before the Lancet published the study,

1470
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,200
Barr sent Wakefield a letter saying, and I quote,

1471
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,460
actually, I got Sean to say it.

1472
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,040
I have mentioned to you before

1473
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,920
that the prime objective is to produce

1474
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,880
unassailable evidence in court

1475
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,480
so as to convince a court

1476
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,940
that these vaccines are dangerous.

1477
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,060
Oh, okay.

1478
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,020
This whole thing was bullshit, wasn't it?

1479
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,900
And hey, remember Jabs?

1480
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,940
Jabs was involved with the lawsuit,

1481
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,400
and it turned out their members helped to recruit

1482
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,060
many of the parents to the study in the first place.

1483
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,580
I swear to God, this isn't one of the joke logos we made.

1484
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,740
This is actually the header on their Facebook page.

1485
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,120
This low-resolution, shitty nightmare.

1486
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,360
Jackie Fletcher, the founder of Jabs,

1487
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,620
was also a litigant in the lawsuit.

1488
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,620
They needed her connections to the dozen or so other parents

1489
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,540
who actually blamed MMR to be able to do all of this.

1490
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,240
Some of the parents were even involved

1491
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,340
with the lawsuit too.

1492
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,040
It's kind of clever if you think about it.

1493
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,760
A couple of parents blamed vaccines

1494
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,340
for their child's autism and wanted to sue its manufacturer,

1495
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,920
but there was no evidence it wasn't just a coincidence,

1496
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,100
so they told their opinions to a doctor

1497
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,260
their lawyer had hired who would then report

1498
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,800
those opinions in a paper,

1499
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,180
and now in court you can say there's scientific evidence

1500
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,520
implying a link between vaccines and autism

1501
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,220
even though the link is just those opinions from before.

1502
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,340
There's probably a word for this trick.

1503
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,260
Idea laundering? I don't know.

1504
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,600
Not all of the parents knew the study was being done

1505
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,600
to help a lawsuit,

1506
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
but they were all chosen deliberately.

1507
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,260
However, like we explored earlier,

1508
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,060
not many parents in 1996 blamed vaccines for autism,

1509
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,520
so they had to cast a wide net to even find

1510
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,200
the couple of parents they did.

1511
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,520
Child 11 wasn't even from England.

1512
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,940
He was from California.

1513
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,360
If a contact of Jabs or Richard Barr

1514
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,540
thought you might suspect vaccines

1515
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,920
made your child autistic,

1516
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,920
you and your child were being flown around the world

1517
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,540
to take part in this study,

1518
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,300
and even then some of the parents still turned out

1519
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,960
not to blame the vaccine.

1520
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,500
I cannot stress enough what a fucking shambles

1521
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,500
this paper was.

1522
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,380
Most of the other doctors working on the study

1523
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,220
had no idea the guy running it had been paid

1524
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,980
hundreds of thousands of pounds to discredit MMR.

1525
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,820
According to Chadwick's later testimony,

1526
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,780
Wakefield worked separately with each individual scientist

1527
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,440
instead of bringing them all together,

1528
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,400
which would have been the normal thing to do.

1529
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,700
This afforded Wakefield a good level of secrecy

1530
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,700
about his motives.

1531
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,620
The other scientists must have largely thought

1532
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,460
they really were looking into a connection

1533
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,780
between autism and bowel disorders in children,

1534
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,500
so even the doctors and scientists involved

1535
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,500
were being lied to and tricked

1536
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,420
into lending their time and effort

1537
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,580
to a study being done to help a lawsuit

1538
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,500
make some lawyers a lot of money.

1539
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,220
Once all of this came out,

1540
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,300
Wakefield was, medically speaking, fucked.

1541
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,900
While he'd been asked to leave his post years earlier,

1542
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,040
he still had a license to practice medicine in the UK,

1543
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,960
but amidst all of these discoveries,

1544
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,740
the General Medical Council began a fitness-to-practice

1545
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,080
hearing against Wakefield,

1546
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,760
going through the records of the study

1547
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,180
to evaluate whether his behavior had been ethical.

1548
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,000
The row he started dominated the headlines.

1549
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,420
Now his conduct, not his views,

1550
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,880
will be making the news.

1551
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,180
This hearing would go on to last for 217 days,

1552
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,840
making it the longest in General Medical Council history

1553
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,220
and longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.

1554
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,640
This is Wakefield's only legitimate achievement.

1555
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,480
He made such a fucking mess,

1556
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,900
it took that long to pick through it all.

1557
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,820
Meanwhile, remember when Wakefield sued Brian Deer?

1558
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,700
This would turn out to be the worst mistake

1559
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,160
he ever made in his life.

1560
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,360
Because Wakefield's libel case

1561
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,400
was related to accusations of what he did during a study,

1562
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,320
that meant that the records of what happened in the study

1563
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
were evidence in the case now.

1564
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,120
I mean, how else were they gonna prove it was libel or not?

1565
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,860
The judge agreed that Deer had to be granted access

1566
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,660
to the confidential, unredacted medical records

1567
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,080
of the children from the study.

1568
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,740
By trying to sue a journalist into shutting up,

1569
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,580
Wakefield had accidentally given him permission

1570
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,300
to see everything.

1571
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,920
Deer recalls being sat in a room with his lawyer,

1572
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,800
reading the medical records of the children

1573
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
and other records of what happened in the study

1574
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,800
while Wakefield's legal team were rushing

1575
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,340
to get a cab to take them to the courthouse

1576
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,520
so they could drop the suit and stop him reading it

1577
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,760
as fast as they could.

1578
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,000
Deer got home that night to a call from his lawyer

1579
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,620
saying the case—new firmware available?

1580
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,620
Thanks, Windows!

1581
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,700
Deer got home that night to a call from his lawyer

1582
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,200
telling him the case was over,

1583
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,380
and as a fun bonus,

1584
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,260
because of how lawsuits work in the UK,

1585
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,580
Wakefield had to pay Deer's legal costs,

1586
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,880
the check for which Deer keeps proudly displayed

1587
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,640
on his website, but Deer wasn't done yet.

1588
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,920
Wakefield had just dropped a lawsuit

1589
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,840
to stop him finding things out.

1590
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
But in the context of that lawsuit,

1591
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,060
a great deal of information was disclosed to me

1592
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,400
by Wakefield's lawyers,

1593
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,060
and it was quite clear I had to continue.

1594
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,320
Deer continued his research and also attended

1595
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,940
many of the GMC's hearings about Wakefield's conduct

1596
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,040
which discussed many of the same records

1597
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,320
he just dropped a lawsuit to hide,

1598
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,840
and based on all of this, he put the pieces together

1599
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,620
and figured out exactly what happened during the study.

1600
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,420
The result of his work is an absolutely incredible series

1601
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,220
of articles first published in the British Medical Journal.

1602
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,420
♪♪

1603
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,000
There's another fucking firmware!

1604
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,680
Why is there so much firmware?

1605
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,800
Deer figured out who some of the previously

1606
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,340
anonymous parents of the children in the study were

1607
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,340
and showed some of them what the study said

1608
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,420
about their children, and it turned out

1609
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,760
the paper was lying.

1610
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,760
For example, he showed the medical records

1611
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,340
to the father of child 11.

1612
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,600
And he looked at the paper, and he just looked

1613
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,560
at what it said about his own child,

1614
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,600
and he said, that's not true.

1615
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,320
And that was, uh, one of the parents

1616
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,780
of one of these children in the paper.

1617
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,520
In a correspondence with Deer, he literally wrote...

1618
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,820
The Lancet article indicates that autistic symptoms

1619
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,860
started 15 months, a week after the MMR,

1620
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,100
which is completely inaccurate.

1621
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,360
My son's autistic behavior started 2 1⁄2 to 3 months

1622
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,700
after the MMR, which was administered to him

1623
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,120
at 15 months.

1624
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,000
The bottom line is, if my son is indeed patient 11,

1625
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,120
then the Lancet article made a false assertion

1626
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,200
that his symptoms set in immediately after the MMR,

1627
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,300
in service of some attorney's efforts to prove causation

1628
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,240
that, unbeknownst to me, apparently drove this research.

1629
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,460
He told Deer Wakefield had said his son

1630
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,500
was the 13th child they'd looked at

1631
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,120
and wasn't included in the paper,

1632
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,200
and that's why none of the information in the study

1633
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,000
seemed to describe his son.

1634
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,720
According to Brian Deer, Wakefield had rewritten

1635
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,600
his son's medical history and lied to him to cover it up.

1636
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,760
And this wasn't the only parent who had their story

1637
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,980
changed by Wakefield.

1638
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,680
You see, for the study to be useful in Barr's lawsuit,

1639
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,480
they needed to establish a temporal link

1640
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,480
with the vaccine.

1641
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,860
Since this is the age autism usually develops,

1642
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,020
they needed it to be within 14 days

1643
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,620
and, if possible, even closer.

1644
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,660
I mean, otherwise, it might seem like it was just

1645
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,280
a coincidence, which it is, but like child 11,

1646
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,660
the onset of autism wasn't convenient enough

1647
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,300
in almost any of the other children.

1648
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,380
The table suggests that eight of the 12 children's parents

1649
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,180
claimed the symptoms happened within 14 days,

1650
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,960
but according to Brian Deer's reporting

1651
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,340
from the medical council hearings,

1652
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,460
many of the parents never said this,

1653
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,300
and most of the children's medical records

1654
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,300
put their symptoms starting way after this time period

1655
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,960
with some of them showing symptoms

1656
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,600
of what could have been autism before they were vaccinated.

1657
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,940
Almost every child's autistic symptoms

1658
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,940
either started way too late to be useful in the lawsuit

1659
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,520
or way too soon.

1660
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,240
Wakefield just lied and changed the times

1661
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,020
and allegations of the parents around

1662
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,520
until the paper said what he needed it to say.

1663
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,900
This is the thing that makes so much of what he said

1664
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,300
during the scare really fucking infuriating.

1665
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,800
Like, he would constantly bring up

1666
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,680
how he was just listening to the parents

1667
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,760
and reporting what they were saying.

1668
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,480
We believe.

1669
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,600
We trust in the parents' story.

1670
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,480
If you think there was a problem with my shitty study,

1671
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,900
you're calling all of those parents liars.

1672
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,100
How dare you?

1673
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,240
When they say to you,

1674
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,700
I believe my child regressed after the MMR vaccine,

1675
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,400
do you take that seriously or not?

1676
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,700
Damn right you do.

1677
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,860
Damn right you do.

1678
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,740
He got all high and mighty about how you need

1679
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,260
to believe the parents when he had made up

1680
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,140
most of what the parents had said

1681
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,260
and the media fucking ate it up too.

1682
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,480
Andrew Wakefield is one of the few doctors

1683
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,060
to listen to parents who believe their children

1684
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,940
were damaged by MMR.

1685
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,780
He's the only doctor who listens to the lies

1686
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:55,820
that he wrote for a lawsuit he was being paid to help with.

1687
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,900
Fucking hell.

1688
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,580
Remember that new syndrome Wakefield came up with?

1689
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,400
Now we know why he did that.

1690
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,040
To pursue a class action lawsuit

1691
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,820
against the vaccine's manufacturers

1692
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,120
and convince a court of the vaccine's danger,

1693
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,660
to quote a judge, Barr needed it to cause

1694
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,660
a distinct and specific clinical syndrome.

1695
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,240
If all the kids just had random bowel disorders,

1696
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,620
there wouldn't be a clear enough link to the vaccine,

1697
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,320
but if they all had a fancy new disease,

1698
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,860
he could argue they were all caused by the same thing.

1699
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,620
Wakefield invented autistic enterocolitis,

1700
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,580
which he repeatedly called a genuinely new syndrome

1701
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,580
in the media so the lawsuit could justify itself.

1702
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,860
Of course, to do this,

1703
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,400
all the children's bowel disorders

1704
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,280
would have to actually look similar enough

1705
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,540
that they could reasonably be called the same thing.

1706
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,740
The paper listed 11 of the 12 children

1707
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,120
having some form of nonspecific colitis,

1708
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,780
creating the illusion that they all had a similar disorder.

1709
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,080
According to the actual medical records,

1710
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,440
only three of them had any major inflammation whatsoever.

1711
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,280
The study had a pathologist on board

1712
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,900
to determine what sort of bowel diseases the children had.

1713
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,160
When she and her team ruled out colitis

1714
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,440
in over half of the children,

1715
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,400
which would obviously have been bad for the lawsuit,

1716
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,640
Wakefield brought in a second pathologist

1717
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,140
who had worked with him before to run the tests again.

1718
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,600
When the second pathologist didn't even make mention

1719
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,220
of colitis in his reports,

1720
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,980
Wakefield ignored both of them and just wrote in the paper

1721
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,640
that 11 of the 12 children had similar nonspecific colitis.

1722
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,280
Wakefield went over the heads of everyone on his team

1723
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,820
who didn't find any colitis and decided by himself

1724
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,980
that all the children had a special new gut disorder

1725
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,600
that causes autism.

1726
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,600
What the fuck?

1727
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,760
But that's not all.

1728
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,880
You know how most of the children in the study

1729
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,840
were diagnosed with a form of autism

1730
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,620
and how, like, that's the entire point

1731
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,920
that most of them had autism?

1732
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,000
Like, that's the whole thing?

1733
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,800
Well, it turns out that some of the children

1734
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,420
reported as autistic in the study

1735
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,040
didn't even have autism.

1736
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,580
♪♪

1737
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,620
Child seven was never diagnosed with autism

1738
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,380
before, during, or after this study.

1739
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:59,500
He was referred to the study because child six,

1740
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,120
his brother, was diagnosed with autism.

1741
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,420
Wakefield reported that this child was also autistic

1742
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,240
and started showing signs of autism

1743
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,580
24 hours after being vaccinated.

1744
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,460
I mean, why not if you're just making shit up, right?

1745
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:16,000
Child 12 had also never been given an autism diagnosis.

1746
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,380
The developmental specialist who diagnosed them

1747
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,380
said they had an impairment in respective language

1748
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,920
but did not diagnose them with autism.

1749
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,580
Wakefield, who, just to remind you,

1750
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,380
is a gut surgeon with no psychiatric expertise

1751
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,620
whatsoever, decided this was enough for him

1752
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,260
to say they were autistic

1753
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,760
and since their parents didn't blame the vaccine,

1754
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,720
he said loss of speech development

1755
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,420
and deterioration in language skills

1756
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,140
noted at 16 months and made sure to mention

1757
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,300
the child had MMR at 15 months

1758
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,040
just so you know it started soon after the vaccine

1759
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,300
even though the parents didn't blame it.

1760
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,140
Oh, and while he was there, he diagnosed them

1761
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,380
with chronic nonspecific colitis too.

1762
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,680
You can see why Wakefield dropped his lawsuit

1763
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,000
as fast as he could when Deer got permission

1764
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,080
to read these, right?

1765
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,500
This is likely why he never did

1766
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,540
the larger study when he was asked to.

1767
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,540
Once this fraudulent paper was out,

1768
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,920
all the extra attention and scrutiny he gained

1769
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,620
would have made it impossible to lie

1770
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,960
and get away with it again.

1771
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,160
To this day, no attempt to recreate

1772
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,380
Wakefield's findings has ever succeeded.

1773
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,040
The paper that started the obsession

1774
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,260
with the connection between autism and vaccines

1775
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,880
was a total fraud crafted by a lawyer

1776
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,500
and the opportunistic doctor who he bought

1777
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,920
and in the last 20 years,

1778
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,420
data from millions and millions of children

1779
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,840
all over the world indicates no link whatsoever.

1780
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,600
The only paper that came close to showing that link

1781
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,960
is a study so full of lies that even before it was out,

1782
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,000
scientists who worked on it were asking

1783
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,800
to have their names taken off.

1784
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,720
The paper wasn't just badly made.

1785
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,260
It wasn't just questionable.

1786
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,500
It wasn't bold and controversial.

1787
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,640
It was a lie for money,

1788
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,100
but the worst thing about this study

1789
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,600
was that somehow even that wasn't the worst thing.

1790
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:58,580
["Wakefield"]

1791
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,580
["Wakefield"]

1792
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,960
["Wakefield"]

1793
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,380
Hey, folks, the next section deals

1794
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,800
with some pretty heavy stuff,

1795
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,080
so if you're not into stories of child abuse,

1796
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,500
uh, skip to the next chapter.

1797
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,500
["Wakefield"]

1798
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,000
As we've already explored,

1799
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,800
Wakefield was trying to discover a new disease

1800
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,760
linking autism and bowel disorders,

1801
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,300
so during the study, he did everything he could

1802
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,760
to find that link.

1803
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,880
For this reason, each child underwent

1804
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,300
a rough battery of invasive procedures.

1805
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,840
The children spent a full week at the hospital,

1806
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,880
during which they were frequently sedated,

1807
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,220
given laxatives, had blood samples taken,

1808
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,960
and then they were given colonoscopies,

1809
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,000
lumbar punctures where a needle is inserted

1810
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,380
between the bones of your spine to extract fluid,

1811
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,560
MRI scans, again under sedation,

1812
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,300
electroencephalograms where wires and electrodes

1813
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,720
are run to the patient's head,

1814
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,100
and a variety of other uncomfortable procedures.

1815
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,340
A doctor once described this list of tests

1816
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,380
as a lot even for adults to go through,

1817
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,640
never mind autistic children.

1818
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,140
Now, there's this thing in medicine

1819
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,060
called informed consent.

1820
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:03,100
Doctors can't just do invasive procedures on people.

1821
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,720
You have to inform the patient

1822
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,440
of the potential risks and dangers,

1823
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,680
and you can only move forward with their approval.

1824
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,820
In this study, the children were very young,

1825
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,860
and some of them, emphasis on some, were autistic.

1826
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,320
This meant the children's parents

1827
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,160
had to give informed consent for them.

1828
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,400
Andrew Wakefield wrote a handout to parents

1829
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,700
to go with the consent form,

1830
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,280
describing the procedures and their potential risks.

1831
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,440
SurCare, a human rights organization,

1832
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,400
acquired a copy of this handout,

1833
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,360
and while the form does mention

1834
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,240
almost every procedure Wakefield intended to do,

1835
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,820
it doesn't mention any of the risks associated with them.

1836
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,920
I'm serious.

1837
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,660
The word risk is literally

1838
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,300
not written anywhere on the form.

1839
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,540
So let's talk about the risks of some of these procedures.

1840
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,720
For those of you who don't know,

1841
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,640
a colonoscopy is when a large tube

1842
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,340
with a camera in it is inserted through your rectum

1843
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,040
all the way up into your guts.

1844
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,460
Normally, this is an important

1845
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,300
and safe diagnostic procedure.

1846
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,460
It's the most accurate test for rectal and colon cancer,

1847
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,040
and this saves a lot of lives.

1848
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,000
Sorry, I'm gonna take a moment and turn this video

1849
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,720
into a public service announcement for colonoscopies.

1850
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,720
Um, get one.

1851
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,060
I'm being serious.

1852
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,860
If you're an adult, especially over the age of 45,

1853
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,480
and you've never had a colonoscopy,

1854
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,440
please seriously consider getting one.

1855
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,640
I've lost an uncle and a close friend

1856
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,740
to bowel cancer at shockingly young ages.

1857
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,400
It's a really common cause of death,

1858
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,320
and if they catch it early, it's treatable.

1859
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,080
Colonoscopies are perfectly safe

1860
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,080
and often life-saving procedures,

1861
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,280
but in children whose intestines are smaller

1862
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,280
and weaker and harder to maneuver in,

1863
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,620
there are risks of serious complications.

1864
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,420
The scope can puncture the intestine,

1865
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,760
which causes bacteria from the gut to leak out

1866
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,720
and cause infection and other serious internal damage.

1867
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,220
Risks of complications are significantly higher

1868
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,140
for children five years or younger.

1869
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,440
We try to be very careful to come around corners.

1870
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,100
And these risks are genuine.

1871
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,740
As part of the attempts to find more evidence later

1872
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:56,280
and follow up on the original 1998 study,

1873
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,160
a five-year-old autistic boy was given a colonoscopy

1874
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,780
that went exceedingly wrong

1875
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:03,080
and was left fighting for his life

1876
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,540
with multiple organ failure after his bowel

1877
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,420
was perforated in 12 places during the procedure.

1878
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,880
There was no medical reason this child needed this procedure.

1879
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,420
He was just being used as a guinea pig

1880
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,200
to find any proof they could

1881
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,540
that autistic enterocolitis was real.

1882
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,580
The Royal Free had to pay almost £500,000,

1883
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,460
roughly a million dollars today,

1884
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,380
in damages to the boy and his parents

1885
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,220
for causing lifelong disabilities

1886
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,800
that required full-time care.

1887
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,300
His parents reported that when they gave consent,

1888
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,840
they had not been told of the risks.

1889
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,980
If this is true, what happened here is an assault.

1890
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,940
They almost killed this child,

1891
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,900
and in the 1998 study,

1892
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,940
they inflicted this procedure

1893
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,840
on children as young as three.

1894
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,040
Wakefield's consent form insists

1895
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,800
that these procedures are usually tolerated well

1896
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,020
by children and that it is entirely painless.

1897
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,900
It gives zero mention of the very real risks

1898
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,820
of inserting several feet of a scope into a child.

1899
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,940
It even says,

1900
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,860
if your child becomes distressed

1901
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,740
or the procedure proves too difficult,

1902
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,440
it will be performed under general anesthetic.

1903
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,980
The form doesn't mention the risks

1904
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,580
of this anesthetic either.

1905
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,100
This normal consent form for a colonoscopy

1906
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,300
makes incredibly clear that there are risks

1907
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,100
of perforation and bleeding

1908
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,720
and the possible adverse reactions

1909
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,100
to being sedated too.

1910
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,640
In case you're watching, Andy,

1911
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,980
this is what informed consent looks like,

1912
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,980
you piece of shi-

1913
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,680
Wakefield needed these parents

1914
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,360
to consent to these procedures.

1915
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,860
His paycheck was resting on finding something

1916
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,320
in the bowels of these children

1917
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,020
that could possibly point to the disease

1918
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,320
he was trying to invent,

1919
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,780
so he wrote a handout that conveniently

1920
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:40,360
didn't mention how risky some of these procedures

1921
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,400
actually were.

1922
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,100
And from other accounts given to Deer

1923
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,940
about what happened during the study,

1924
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,740
the children's experiences were far

1925
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,120
from safe and painless.

1926
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,240
Nurses were leaving and saying they didn't like

1927
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,460
what was being done to these children.

1928
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,280
Junior doctors were unhappy.

1929
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,500
It needed three people to hold these kids down

1930
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,800
in some cases just to have blood taken.

1931
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,920
These are difficult children to explain

1932
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,960
to what is going on.

1933
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,040
I feel very sorry for the children

1934
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,080
who I feel were being abused.

1935
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,060
Children were fainting and vomiting

1936
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,920
and trying to resist the testing.

1937
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,920
They had to be force-fed some of the fluids

1938
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,180
required for the tests.

1939
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,640
They couldn't give one child their lumbar puncture

1940
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,060
because he was uncontrollably vomiting

1941
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,980
from all the other procedures that had been done on him

1942
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:22,980
and it was sent home.

1943
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,400
Another child's lumbar puncture

1944
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,900
went so badly that he had to be rushed

1945
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,320
to a different hospital for treatment.

1946
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,240
If you do stuff like this to kids in your study

1947
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,700
for no clinically justified reason,

1948
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,620
that's child abuse!

1949
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,160
Wakefield treated the children

1950
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,400
as if they had genuine bowel conditions.

1951
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,940
To that end, almost all of them

1952
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,640
were given anti-inflammatory drugs

1953
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,480
for the disorders he'd made up for them.

1954
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,520
These medications often have an increased risk to children,

1955
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,440
particularly under the age of six.

1956
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,740
The risks of adverse events

1957
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,900
includes life-threatening complications

1958
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,360
including increased bleeding,

1959
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,820
increased risk of infections,

1960
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,580
and other severe side effects.

1961
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,960
Some of these kids had problems communicating,

1962
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,880
which would make reporting any side effects

1963
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,960
they were experiencing very difficult,

1964
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,460
further increasing the risk of severe problems

1965
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,720
if something went wrong.

1966
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,980
Considering that barely any of these children

1967
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,020
actually had bowel disorders,

1968
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,140
Wakefield was essentially putting children

1969
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,440
at risk of the side effects of these drugs

1970
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,200
for no reason while he looked for proof

1971
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,160
of the disease he was trying to invent

1972
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,820
to make a lawsuit look good.

1973
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,540
The Medical Council also discovered

1974
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,000
that during the study,

1975
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,780
Wakefield gave an experimental drug

1976
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,580
to one of the children without waiting for approval

1977
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,800
from an ethics committee.

1978
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,800
The drug was called

1979
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,520
Dialysable Lymphocyte Extract Transfer Factor.

1980
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,020
Wait a second.

1981
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,640
The paper is a pilot study

1982
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,560
on the effects of a substance called

1983
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,360
Dialysable Lymphocyte Extract on children with autism.

1984
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,480
Did Wakefield test one of Fudenberg's

1985
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,160
autism-curing drugs on one of the children in his study?

1986
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,160
What the fuck?

1987
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,160
Thanks, Andy.

1988
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,660
I'm sure whatever you gave those kids

1989
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,000
was perfectly safe.

1990
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,780
I mean, if this genius was behind it.

1991
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,200
Where does that come from?

1992
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,200
My bone marrow.

1993
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,240
To convince the child's father to agree

1994
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,400
to let him administer this drug to his child,

1995
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,320
Wakefield offered him a job as managing director

1996
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,820
of a company making and selling the drug.

1997
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,420
Um, okay, my producer told me I can't say that.

1998
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,380
There's no way of proving that happened

1999
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,660
behind closed doors, so just to clarify,

2000
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,580
we don't have evidence that Wakefield

2001
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,500
offered a man a job to give his son a drug.

2002
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,300
It might just be a coincidence

2003
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,000
that the father became managing director

2004
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,260
of a company that would profit

2005
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,880
from selling the drug if it worked.

2006
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,980
Maybe he just happened to have equity

2007
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,780
in the company that would be making the drug

2008
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,160
that was experimentally given to his child.

2009
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,540
We will never know for sure how that happened.

2010
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,540
Ahem.

2011
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:44,460
Let's just walk through that again.

2012
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,620
Andrew Wakefield might have offered a cushy job

2013
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:52,460
to a guy to let him experiment on his kid

2014
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,800
with a drug that he probably got from a guy

2015
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,520
who got fired for stealing medical supplies,

2016
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,020
wasn't a doctor anymore,

2017
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,540
and thought he could cure autism

2018
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,160
using his bone marrow.

2019
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,420
The aristocrats.

2020
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:11,960
On top of all of this, during the investigation,

2021
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,500
the medical council found out that during one

2022
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,760
of his own children's birthday parties,

2023
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,640
Andrew Jeremy Wakefield lined up

2024
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,640
all the other kids at the party

2025
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,600
and offered them money for their blood.

2026
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,360
I have to try and explain this.

2027
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,200
In order to find any potentially useful evidence

2028
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,860
for his study for the lawsuit,

2029
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,960
he needed the blood of non-autistic children

2030
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,380
so he could compare it and see what he could find,

2031
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,420
but to get the blood, instead of, like,

2032
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:44,300
putting in a request for non-autistic children's blood

2033
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:48,000
or, like, calling for volunteers to come to the hospital

2034
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,720
and give their blood and without running it past

2035
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:55,600
an ethics committee, he offered his children's friends

2036
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,640
£5 for their blood.

2037
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
Ha ha ha!

2038
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,980
And no, that's not, like, an allegation

2039
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,940
that someone might have made up.

2040
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,780
Wakefield told people that story at a conference in 1999.

2041
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,540
At the hearing, he claimed to have made up

2042
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,480
the part about throwing up and fainting

2043
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,740
for dramatic effect.

2044
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,400
His best defense of his extremely unethical

2045
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,120
and weird behavior was that he made some of it up.

2046
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,080
Shockingly, telling the ethics committee

2047
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,880
that he was a fucking liar didn't help his case.

2048
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,840
Speaking later in an interview,

2049
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,420
Wakefield defended the birthday party child blood bribes,

2050
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,040
saying it was all totally fine.

2051
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,720
The only problem was that it did not have an approval

2052
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,140
from the hospital ethics committee.

2053
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
That does not make it unethical.

2054
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,900
He's trying to well, actually, a fucking ethics board.

2055
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,700
After reviewing all of this, in 2010,

2056
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,360
the longest inquiry in general medical counsel history

2057
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,540
concluded that Andrew Wakefield had failed

2058
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,880
in his duties as a doctor,

2059
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,880
acted against the interests of his patients,

2060
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,460
and was, you know, a lying con man.

2061
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:15,500
Sorry, that one was me.

2062
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,260
And he was struck off the medical register,

2063
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,640
making him no longer able to practice medicine

2064
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,420
and officially not a doctor,

2065
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,060
so whenever someone calls him a doctor in videos now,

2066
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,180
they're making a mistake.

2067
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,820
Look, I don't want to single this guy out,

2068
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,280
but you shouldn't put doctor in his name.

2069
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,440
He's not a doctor now.

2070
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,780
Even in the documentary he made about himself in 2016,

2071
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,440
he can't put doctor in front of his name.

2072
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,440
He has to put MBBS.

2073
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,240
Well, we know he's at least one kind of BS

2074
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,240
if you know what I'm saying.

2075
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,660
To quote the counsel's charges,

2076
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:45,160
he showed callous disregard for any distress or pain

2077
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,540
the children might suffer.

2078
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,540
That same year,

2079
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:51,580
the Lancet finally formally retracted the original study.

2080
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,080
According to the Lancet's editor, Richard Horton,

2081
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,160
it was utterly clear without any ambiguity at all

2082
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,860
the statements in the paper were utterly false.

2083
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,200
Well done, Richard.

2084
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,540
Here's a round of applause for you.

2085
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,280
Better too late than never, I guess.

2086
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,840
That's not really an expression, is it?

2087
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,880
The conclusion of the inquiry is protested

2088
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,340
by Wakefield's remaining supporters.

2089
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,460
We're with Wakefield!

2090
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,340
We're with Wakefield!

2091
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,140
While a news crew attempts to interview one of his critics,

2092
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,200
one of his supporters attempts to shout him down

2093
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,860
and make sure he can't say anything,

2094
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,820
while another off-screen holds up a book

2095
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,320
insisting it is they who are being silenced.

2096
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,420
The irony is apparently lost on them.

2097
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,340
Wakefield appeared before his flock

2098
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,420
to say this was all completely unjust.

2099
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,380
And I invite anyone to examine

2100
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,100
the contents of these proceedings

2101
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,920
and come to their own conclusions.

2102
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,060
I think we just did, buddy.

2103
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,440
Wakefield did lose a lot of his popularity

2104
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,400
when the extent of his abuse and fraud was made known,

2105
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,820
but he still had a few dedicated fans.

2106
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:55,740
Often the parents of autistic children

2107
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,120
who'd followed him so far

2108
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,120
that they refused to accept what he did.

2109
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,380
To Wakefield, these desperate people

2110
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,120
are the perfect market.

2111
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,040
I suspect the main reason he turned up

2112
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,500
in the last few days of his hearing

2113
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,960
was to advertise the book he'd written

2114
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,800
all about it on national TV.

2115
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,000
The book alleges that the Medical Council hearings

2116
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,720
are just trying to crush him to protect vaccines.

2117
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,760
He titled the book,

2118
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,800
after one of the council's comments about him.

2119
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,660
It's trying to be an ironic reference.

2120
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,540
Like, he's accusing mainstream medicine

2121
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,300
of callously disregarding the victims of MMR,

2122
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,600
but I don't think he considered the implications

2123
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,520
of quoting a doctor pointing out he abused children

2124
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,480
on the cover of a book with a big picture

2125
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,520
of his face on it.

2126
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,020
It's a real if I did it situation.

2127
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,180
Also in the dedication,

2128
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,140
he thanks his long-suffering wife

2129
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,520
who's with him here on the cover.

2130
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,160
She's not his wife anymore though.

2131
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,440
I guess she suffered enough

2132
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,320
and like separate vaccines before it,

2133
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,340
Wakefield made sure to recommend his book

2134
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,880
in every interview he got.

2135
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,600
These numbers, the dates were all fabricated

2136
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,180
to sort of make a case.

2137
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,260
Dr. Gupta, please, I urge you,

2138
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,760
go and read my book.

2139
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,480
You will understand it. Many people don't.

2140
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,440
It's very funny watching him try to sell his merchandise

2141
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,240
now that everyone knows he's a fraud.

2142
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,940
If you read my book, you will be able to read the truth.

2143
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,160
And has the BMJ read my book?

2144
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,620
Have the doctors who apparently looked at all the records

2145
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,280
read my book? No, because the truth is in that book.

2146
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,420
Sir, I've read Brian Deer's report,

2147
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,920
which is incredibly extensive.

2148
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,520
Sir, I'm not here to let you pitch your book.

2149
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,160
I'm here to have you answer questions.

2150
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,960
If you read the record that I have set out in the book,

2151
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,160
you will see the truth.

2152
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,000
But sir, if you're lying, then your book is also a lie.

2153
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,760
Wakefield's defense against Brian Deer's allegations,

2154
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,600
now that suing him to shut him up has failed disastrously,

2155
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,200
is to say Deer is a hit man

2156
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,320
paid by vaccine manufacturers to ruin his career.

2157
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,160
He is a hit man.

2158
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,680
He's been brought in to take me down

2159
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,960
because they are very, very concerned

2160
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,080
about the adverse reactions to vaccines

2161
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,120
that are occurring in children.

2162
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,920
Wait a minute, sir. Let me just stop you right there.

2163
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,960
You say he's a hit man and he's been brought in by they.

2164
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,960
Who is they? Who is he a hit man for?

2165
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,320
This is an independent journalist

2166
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,440
who's won many awards.

2167
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,600
Yeah, he's, uh, and he's, you know,

2168
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,800
who brought this man in?

2169
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,960
Who is paying this man? I don't know.

2170
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,160
Who is behind Brian Deer's reporting?

2171
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,400
Follow the money.

2172
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,080
Also, buy my book, please.

2173
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,800
Wakefield went on to claim later in the interview

2174
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,600
that you're being paid by the Association

2175
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,040
of British Pharmaceutical Industries.

2176
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,080
Are you?

2177
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,600
No, I'm not.

2178
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,480
In 2011, New York Times Magazine staff writer

2179
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,680
Susan Dominus caught up with Wakefield.

2180
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,600
Though Wakefield presents himself to her

2181
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,600
as someone whose career was destroyed

2182
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,480
for going against the dogma that vaccines are safe,

2183
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,880
Dominus is careful to point out that he does this

2184
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,560
while signing copies of his book

2185
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,600
for an enormous line of loyal followers,

2186
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,000
one of whom is a tearful mother who blames herself

2187
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,880
for not preventing her child's autism.

2188
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,520
At the time the article was written,

2189
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,200
Wakefield lived in a beautiful house

2190
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,120
in a reclusive and expensive neighborhood

2191
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,400
in Austin, Texas,

2192
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,360
surrounded by many acres of hills and forest.

2193
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,560
You can almost believe you're in Tuscany,

2194
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,560
he says of the view from his back deck.

2195
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,560
The book made him a decent amount of money,

2196
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,120
as have his many paid speaking engagements

2197
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,400
at anti-vaccine conferences where he's lauded

2198
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,800
as the celebrity who got the movement started.

2199
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,640
There's the hundreds of thousands of pounds

2200
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,640
he got paid to do the study, of course,

2201
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,040
and the multiple documentaries about him and his life

2202
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,560
can't have been too shabby for him.

2203
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,600
It's genuinely shocking how obviously

2204
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,720
he's just grifting anti-vaccine people

2205
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,120
for as much money as he can.

2206
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,480
His 2016 film, Vaxxed,

2207
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,840
is available at a discount on his website

2208
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,040
if you buy it in a pack of ten.

2209
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,080
Give a copy to your local legislators,

2210
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,280
educators, and medical professionals.

2211
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,440
Wakefield wants his followers to pay him

2212
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,040
to do advertising for him.

2213
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,080
When I look back at footage of the last day

2214
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,600
of Wakefield's hearing,

2215
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,080
I'm inevitably looking back at myself ten years ago

2216
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,080
when I saw the same footage live on TV.

2217
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,880
At the time, I saw these people as Wakefield's defenders,

2218
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,880
but in a way, they were also his victims.

2219
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,440
For a decade now, since I was a teenager,

2220
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,880
I've been thinking about this woman

2221
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,880
with the sign saying,

2222
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,160
don't stifle uncomfortable science.

2223
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,800
I remember I first noticed her

2224
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,840
because I saw her and thought,

2225
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,960
wait, is she wearing a Playboy scarf?

2226
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,760
Surely the most uncomfortable thing

2227
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,080
for these people here must be the possibility

2228
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,280
the man they're here to defend has lied to them for money.

2229
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,280
For someone who'd sided with Wakefield

2230
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,680
during the scare, accepting that he had lied

2231
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,360
would mean taking on some of the guilt

2232
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,800
for helping to spread it.

2233
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,040
One of the worst things about Wakefield's actions

2234
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,360
is he's made these people complicit.

2235
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,760
Maybe Wakefield actually cares about these people.

2236
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,760
Maybe not, but either way,

2237
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,000
their money spends just the same.

2238
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,520
I wonder how many of these people bought his books

2239
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,320
or his documentaries.

2240
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,880
I wonder if any of them stop and think

2241
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,760
about how they've made him rich.

2242
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,040
Some of these people are extremely vulnerable,

2243
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,160
parents of children with disabilities,

2244
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,240
some of which require full-time care,

2245
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,840
who fell for Wakefield because he was offering them

2246
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,720
an explanation for why these things happen.

2247
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,000
It brings me no joy to tell you

2248
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,080
they paid for this view.

2249
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,280
We're with Wakefield!

2250
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,320

At the end of all this,

01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,880
I ask the eternal question

2256
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,800
asked of every major fraudster in history.

2257
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,000
How could someone do all this?

2258
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,200
Cause all this fear and doubt

2259
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,600
that has led to real, tangible harm

2260
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,160
against your fellow human beings?

2261
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,800
Why would someone do that?

2266

There's probably a lot of people you could blame

2267
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,320
for anti-vaccine beliefs getting as far as they have.

2268
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,600
The anxieties people have right now

2269
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,000
didn't come from nowhere.

2270
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,920
Wakefield's legacy is built into the very DNA

2271
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,720
of modern vaccine hesitancy.

2272
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,600
Or the RNA, am I right?

2273
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,240
Nice one, Kat. It's very clever.

2274
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,720
Whenever you try to trace a trend of skepticism

2275
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,320
about vaccines far enough,

2276
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,080
it almost always leads back to the fear and anxiety

2277
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,160
that started in 1998 and the men behind it.

2278
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,240
Take, for example, Bill Maher.

2279
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,040
Maher is a proponent of the possible link

2280
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,360
between vaccines and autism

2281
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,200
and frequently has anti-vaccine activists on his show.

2282
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,840
Granted, he also has people on who think that's ridiculous,

2283
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,560
so that's kind of like being fair and balanced.

2284
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,040
His general stance is that vaccines can be good,

2285
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,240
but he doesn't really go for them

2286
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,640
because he's got a better idea.

2287
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,080
I am not a germ theory denier.

2288
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,320
I understand that germs and viruses cause diseases.

2289
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,880
I may have been a little cocky about it

2290
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,720
because I discovered from first-hand experience

2291
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,840
that I could stave them off better with proper nutrition.

2292
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,440
If your child dies of measles,

2293
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,000
it's because he didn't eat his vegetables.

2294
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,240
Bubonic plague!

2295
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,280
Skip a trip to McDonald's, sheeple!

2296
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,040
Throughout the years, Bill has repeated over and over

2297
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,720
his distrust of vaccines

2298
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,960
and the possible side effects they might pose.

2299
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,280
I've tried to find an example of him citing a source

2300
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,800
or giving some kind of data,

2301
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,760
but no, it's always this general sense

2302
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,040
that people think something might be wrong.

2303
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,640
There's all these parents who say,

2304
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,960
I had a normal child, got the vaccine.

2305
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,640
This story keeps coming up.

2306
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,240
Lots of parents are saying stuff,

2307
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,760
and that's basically evidence,

2308
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,560
and of course there's the old standout,

2309
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,600
lots of people feel like me.

2310
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,320
I was attacked for saying we should look into this

2311
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,360
and I don't believe in it

2312
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,240
and lots of people feel the same way.

2313
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,640
I've heard a lot of stuff about feelings

2314
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,240
being more important than facts,

2315
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,960
so this is basically science, right?

2316
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,560
Bill, you having us on the show

2317
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,920
and rehashing all these problems

2318
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,280
you got yourself into on your last show,

2319
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,520
it's like going on a date and talking about your ex-wife.

2320
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,520
Yeah!

2321
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,240
Yeah!

2322
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,280
If an intellectual titan like Bill Maher

2323
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,120
thinks vaccines might be dangerous,

2324
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,040
he must believe it for a good reason.

2325
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,280
I did a lot of digging on this,

2326
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,600
and I found a time when he made

2327
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,880
a concrete scientific claim about vaccines.

2328
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,880
In 2005, he was interviewed on Larry King Live.

2329
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,360
This isn't footage of that interview.

2330
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,640
I couldn't find footage of this one,

2331
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,600
but there is a transcript on the CNN website.

2332
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,720
During this interview, they discuss the flu shot,

2333
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,840
which King had been taking for 25 years.

2334
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,720
Maher tells him the best defense against disease

2335
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,120
is to have a strong immune system.

2336
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,000
I guess that's where the proper nutrition comes in

2337
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,840
and says that the flu shot is actually bad

2338
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,920
for your immune system.

2339
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,520
He cites a strong distrust

2340
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,840
of what he calls Western medicine,

2341
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,800
which is a bit of a Eurocentric misnomer.

2342
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,440
A lot of non-Western countries develop vaccines

2343
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,080
and other modern medicine, you know.

2344
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,080
Whatever. He doesn't care.

2345
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,320
The conversation then turns to the avian flu,

2346
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,160
which was a real concern at the time.

2347
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,200
Bill states that he's not worried about bird flu

2348
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,200
and gives a fascinatingly vague list of reasons why.

2349
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,680
First of all, it's not going to happen,

2350
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,880
which was a very clever insight

2351
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,760
right up until something like that really did happen.

2352
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,040
Uh, that's why people were worried about it, Bill.

2353
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,280
Second of all, the fact it is mutating

2354
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,720
shows that if you did come up with a vaccine tomorrow,

2355
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,040
it wouldn't be effective against the disease

2356
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,680
when the disease comes because the disease

2357
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,640
is always morphing and mutating.

2358
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,400
Bill is such a good public speaker.

2359
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,400
The fact that vaccines actually help stop

2360
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,000
the disease from spreading

2361
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,080
and therefore developing those mutations

2362
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,280
in the first place is lost on him.

2363
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,920
Well, it was, but he got vaccinated for COVID-19,

2364
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,160
so clearly he sees the value now.

2365
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,680
This is attached to an announcement

2366
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,960
that he got the virus,

2367
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,880
so this week's show has to be canceled.

2368
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,200
Apparently, he's asymptomatic and feels fine,

2369
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
so I guess vaccines are pretty good, aren't they?

2370
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,200
Considering how at-risk unvaccinated 65-year-olds

2371
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,320
are for this virus,

2372
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,080
I'm really glad he got vaccinated for his sake,

2373
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,280
but they should probably just cancel his show completely.

2374
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,480
I mean, we don't want to risk losing a national treasure.

2375
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,880
The reality is a lot of pseudo-libertarian skepticism

2376
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,640
about Western medicine instantly falls apart

2377
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,040
the second it has to interact with reality

2378
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,480
where people really do die of diseases.

2379
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,200
For example, the man he is speaking to,

2380
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,120
Larry King, passed away this year

2381
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,320
of complications from COVID-19.

2382
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,280
Anyway, Ma tells King that vaccines

2383
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,600
are just a trick to get money.

2384
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,040
It's just a way to funnel money

2385
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,000
into the pharmaceutical companies.

2386
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,240
Follow the money.

2387
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,320
You'll find out where the bird flu is.

2388
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,680
If bird flu had got bad enough,

2389
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,520
you can guarantee Ma would have paid

2390
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,880
top dollar for the vaccine.

2391
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,480
Anyway, the discussion goes downhill

2392
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,400
even further for Ma when King points out

2393
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,840
that vaccines are great and polio was virtually eradicated

2394
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,200
thanks to vaccination.

2395
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,880
Bill gives this beautiful reply.

2396
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,080
Yes, but, you know,

2397
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,680
there are many books out that will...

2398
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,160
that will...

2399
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,200
and I'm not well enough versed on it to talk about it

2400
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,760
that will indicate that there are other reasons

2401
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,600
why it was.

2402
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,240
And a lot of diseases that have been, they say,

2403
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,520
whoa, this was eliminated because of a vaccine,

2404
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,560
they find out, well, no, actually,

2405
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,600
the country got toilets and that's what happened.

2406
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,680
I think Bill really does a good job of summing up

2407
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,960
a lot of people's beliefs about vaccination here.

2408
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,200
Ma thinks it's smart to be skeptical about vaccines

2409
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,800
right up until there's consequences

2410
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,840
for himself, of course,

2411
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,880
but his explanations are all unfounded

2412
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,040
and unscientific.

2413
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,760
The best he can say is there's probably books out there

2414
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,000
that prove he's right, maybe,

2415
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,520
but he's not read them.

2416
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,520
This isn't skepticism.

2417
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,680
This is ignorance trying to sound like skepticism.

2418
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,040
To bring it all full circle,

2419
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,240
it seems like Bill's beliefs about vaccines

2420
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,000
are really based on that big scare

2421
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,800
that started in the late 90s.

2422
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,680
After all, the only factoid he seems to ever be able

2423
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,000
to remember is that lots of parents said

2424
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,520
they were bad that one time,

2425
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,880
and that's not even a fact.

2426
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,920
That's some opinions he remembers.

2427
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,480
I'd joke that it's a pity they don't make a vaccine

2428
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,800
for confirmation bias,

2429
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,360
but he wouldn't have got it, would he?

2430
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,520
There is, however, one time in this old interview

2431
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,520
where he really does attempt to make a scientific claim.

2432
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,760
He tells Larry that if you get the flu shot

2433
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,560
more than five years in a row,

2434
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,320
it tenfold increases the risk of getting Alzheimer's.

2435
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,720
Hmm, that's a really specific thing to say.

2436
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,400
Maybe by checking this claim out,

2437
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,840
we can figure out who he's getting his beliefs from.

2438
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,600
I looked, and there are actually studies

2439
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,800
on the impact of vaccination on rates of Alzheimer's.

2440
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,240
Um, the risk of Alzheimer's goes down.

2441
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,120
Okay, so this clearly isn't his source.

2442
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,560
I did some more digging, though,

2443
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,040
and I found that in 1997 at a vaccine conference,

2444
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,480
in one guy's presentation,

2445
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,280
he said that a scientist had found that this happens.

2446
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,720
There's no study cited here,

2447
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,400
but that's at least a source for Bill's claims.

2448
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,600
Let's check the doctor's papers

2449
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,320
and see if we can find out for ourselves.

2450
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,480
Wait a second. I blurred the scientist's name out

2451
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,400
by accident. Let me fix that.

2452
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,680
Dr. Hugh Fudenberg?

2453
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,680
Wahahahaha!

2454
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,640
No matter how you look at it,

2455
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,680
a vast, vast majority of anti-vaccine rhetoric

2456
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,320
and pseudoscience can be traced directly back

2457
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,720
to these two guys.

2458
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,160
According to a survey of U.S. health care professionals

2459
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:31,240
in 2016, 77% of parents refusing vaccination

2460
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,720
for their children still cite a fear of a link with autism.

2461
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,240
When people refuse medicine for their children,

2462
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,560
they largely point to the hazy memory

2463
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,840
of the scare Wakefield started for money.

2464
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,160
So yeah, it's pretty important to point out

2465
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,880
they both lost their medical licenses

2466
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,400
and their science was garbage,

2467
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,240
and despite being an obvious hack, fraud, con man,

2468
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,360
Wakefield is still embraced by the anti-vaccine community.

2469
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,400
Wakefield was a guest of honor at Conspiracy,

2470
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,640
the week-long cruise for all kinds of conspiracy theorists

2471
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,480
where believers of all stripes gather to share their theories

2472
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,880
about climate change, the Earth being flat,

2473
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,240
time travelers, and horses being real.

2474
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,600
The kind of funny thing is Wakefield himself

2475
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,440
seems pretty embarrassed by this.

2476
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,560
A skeptic who went on the cruise noted how unhappy he looked

2477
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,160
with the implication of being a hero to a community

2478
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,880
that absolutely loves complete quacks.

2479
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,760
The story of my life is basically how to take

2480
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,080
a perfectly good career and flush it down the toilet.

2481
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,760
Luckily for Wakefield, the toilet is full of money,

2482
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,040
and all he has to do to get it is lean further

2483
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,480
and further away from science and deeper into this culture.

2484
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,160
He's had to pivot to saying all vaccines are dangerous

2485
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,160
because his new anti-vaccine audience

2486
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,000
aren't very receptive to the old claim

2487
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,280
that I'm not anti-vaccine, just one vaccine is dangerous,

2488
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,200
and I recommend mine instead.

2489
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,560
I don't think these people would buy a 10-pack of that story.

2490
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,720
And of course, in the middle of the pandemic

2491
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,360
that is currently happening,

2492
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,200
Wakefield emerged from his mansion to remind everyone

2493
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:00,040
that a virus that has so far killed over three million people

2494
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,200
is better than being vaccinated against it.

2495
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,720
As Nelson Mandela said at his trial,

2496
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,320
there are ideals worth dying for.

2497
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,200
Presumably of COVID-19.

2498
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,120
I don't want to get too dramatic,

2499
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:17,080
but better to die as a free man than live as a slave!

2500
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,920
I don't think that was too dramatic, do you?

2501
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,200
The fact the movement he started is still based

2502
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:28,280
almost completely on his lies is pretty important to point out,

2503
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,920
and in fact, it's useful to point it out

2504
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,880
because despite how it might look,

2505
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,360
the truth can be a powerful thing.

2506
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,520
Once Wakefield got chased out to America

2507
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,360
and had his medical license taken away,

2508
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,640
vaccination rates in the UK recovered.

2509
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,600
I love this because you can basically see

2510
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,600
the effects of Brian Deer's reporting on a graph.

2511
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,000
Like, the scare starts, and it gets worse and worse and worse,

2512
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,760
and then Brian Deer's reporting comes out,

2513
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,320
and bam, it's on its way back up.

2514
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,480
Like, the truth does make a difference.

2515
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,120
And then when Wakefield's license was taken away,

2516
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,920
we went right back up to pre-scare levels.

2517
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,880
Of course, getting chased out to America

2518
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,120
meant he started peddling his lies in America,

2519
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,800
so sorry about that, but it does seem pretty clear

2520
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,120
that the truth helps people make up their minds

2521
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,120
about this stuff.

2522
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,680
Fascinatingly, a lot of Britain

2523
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,440
seems to remember the MMR scare

2524
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,400
and the revelation that it was based on lies

2525
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,880
and learned a lesson about vaccine alarmism.

2526
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,880
According to polls of global willingness

2527
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,800
to take the COVID-19 vaccine,

2528
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,880
other countries start relatively low,

2529
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,800
perhaps dimly remembering some people

2530
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,200
saying vaccines are bad.

2531
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,960
Then acceptance grows as it becomes increasingly clear

2532
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,400
the new vaccines are safe.

2533
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,520
Wait, where's the UK?

2534
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,560
Well, boys, we're just chilling up here.

2535
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,440
We've been through this before, you see.

2536
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,760
That's my British accent?

2537
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,280
It seems like our past experience

2538
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,080
with bullshit vaccine scares

2539
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,320
has inoculated us against future ones.

2540
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,320
Cat wrote that line.

2541
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,280
I didn't find the one weird trick

2542
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,240
doctors hate to deconverting people

2543
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,480
from being against vaccines

2544
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,760
and changing their minds or anything here.

2545
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,320
What we've really discovered is that

2546
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,360
if you lay the whole story out like this,

2547
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,800
people can do a good job of making up their own minds.

2548
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,160
The actual scientific community works very hard

2549
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,480
to be receptive to potential side effects.

2550
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,600
When even the potential maybe possibility maybe

2551
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,200
of one of the vaccines having side effects came up,

2552
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,560
the FDA and the CDC briefly recommended

2553
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,400
not getting it for a while until later

2554
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,520
when they checked and were sure it was fine.

2555
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,640
Vaccine safety is taken extremely seriously

2556
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:24,200
by medical scientists and doctors for obvious reasons.

2557
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,520
Actually, here's a fun example of how stringent

2558
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,280
the community is about vaccines.

2559
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,920
Wakefield's alternative vaccine

2560
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,800
was based on such bad science,

2561
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,440
it would never have made it out of clinical trials.

2562
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,760
The medical work behind it was awful.

2563
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,160
I mean, one of its author's names

2564
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,240
is spelled wrong on page one.

2565
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,960
The science on the following pages

2566
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,520
is roughly what you'd expect from something like that.

2567
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,120
I think I might actually make a bonus video for patrons

2568
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,200
just covering this vaccine patent

2569
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,360
because it is whack.

2570
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,520
Really, Andrew Wakefield was always doomed

2571
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,160
to end up as a scam artist.

2572
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,000
He wasn't very good at the science

2573
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,240
when he was a doctor.

2574
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,040
All the coronavirus vaccines currently in use

2575
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,840
have passed tests and checks

2576
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,640
that his alternative measles vaccine

2577
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,840
would never have done.

2578
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,680
Wakefield can pretend he's not gonna get the vaccine

2579
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,080
and appear at health freedom summits

2580
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,680
that recommend you don't get it

2581
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,280
and instead eliminate toxins

2582
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,520
with only affordable products and cooking hacks,

2583
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,080
but I certainly hope for his sake

2584
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,240
that he just gets the vaccine in secret

2585
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,840
because otherwise the next cruise

2586
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,600
is gonna have a fucking body count.

2587
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,280
There is another way the truth can change people's minds.

2588
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,480
Living proof.

2589
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,560
If someone thinks the coronavirus vaccines

2590
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,520
might be dangerous,

2591
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,880
one of the best ways to help

2592
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,000
seems to be people around them getting it

2593
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,480
and showing them how it's fine.

2594
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,760
In early polls before a vaccine was out,

2595
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,240
a lot of people in the USA

2596
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,600
claimed they were going to hold off

2597
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,200
until they were sure it was safe,

2598
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,920
which is a pretty risky decision

2599
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,640
considering the danger of the virus

2600
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,320
versus any possible side effects of the vaccine.

2601
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,280
Like, a third of people who get infected,

2602
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,360
even if it's minor,

2603
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,600
are left with long-term complications,

2604
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,800
like long-distance runners are left unable

2605
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,080
to climb stairs without getting out of breath,

2606
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,600
people have lost eyesight,

2607
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,000
people have lost teeth,

2608
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,080
and of course a lot of people have died of the disease,

2609
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,800
but over time as more and more people did get the vaccine,

2610
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,440
that by itself changed a lot of minds.

2611
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,800
The truth is it was easy in 2020

2612
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,320
to have your doubts about a theoretical vaccine

2613
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,680
that no one had had yet,

2614
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,600
but now when half the people around you already have it

2615
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,880
and they're obviously fine,

2616
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,520
it's a whole lot harder to have those doubts.

2617
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,680
Over time, the people waiting and seeing

2618
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,680
seem to have decided they've seen enough

2619
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,280
and they want what those guys are having,

2620
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,120
so this is my call to action in case anyone needs it.

2621
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,680
You should get a COVID vaccine if you can.

2622
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:39,400
You know, get one while you're there for your colonoscopy.

2623
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,320
The vaccine makes life safer for you

2624
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,800
and reduces the possibility of passing the virus

2625
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,040
to someone more vulnerable,

2626
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,080
so you won't have that on your conscience either.

2627
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:50,240
I know having a conscience is virtue signaling now,

2628
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,880
but still, it's a nice bonus,

2629
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,080
and on top of that,

2630
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,720
if there are people in your life who could be at risk

2631
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,160
who need convincing of the vaccine's safety,

2632
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,640
you could be the evidence they need.

2633
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,200
It's amazing how compelling seeing other people

2634
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,600
get vaccinated can be.

2635
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:08,480
There is, sadly, one concerning thing about the data.

2636
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,040
There are some people who started out

2637
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,800
saying no to vaccination

2638
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,680
and have largely stayed that way.

2639
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,000
Maybe some of them will budge

2640
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
as more and more people get vaccinated,

2641
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,880
but there's probably a group who are so distrustful

2642
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,440
of vaccines because of everything

2643
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,640
we've discussed so far

2644
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,480
that they can't have their minds changed

2645
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,080
even by the hundreds of millions

2646
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,720
of obviously completely safely vaccinated people

2647
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:29,720
all around them.

2648
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,360
People can invest a lot of ego and pride

2649
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,760
in not accepting evidence

2650
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,960
that contradicts their beliefs about the world,

2651
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,760
and it really doesn't help that there are hundreds of people

2652
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,680
exactly like Andrew Wakefield

2653
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,640
who are ready to tell them everything they believe

2654
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,640
is already true,

2655
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,960
and they just need to buy their supplements

2656
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,840
or DVDs or cooking hacks

2657
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,000
and enable people to convince themselves

2658
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,560
that they don't need to do any more thinking

2659
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,280
for a small fee, of course.

2660
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,280
Aw, come on, though.

2661
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,920
Comparing Wakefield to Alex Jones,

2662
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,920
that's a bit much.

2663
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,600
There's no way Wakefield would stoop to...

2664
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,600
Ha ha ha!

2665
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,040
Have you learned nothing?

2666
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,040
Good to have you here with us.

2667
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,040
It's great to be here, Alex.

2668
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,040
Thank you very much.

2669
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,360
Changing these people's minds

2670
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,680
really should be their job,

2671
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,120
and it's nobody else's fault

2672
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,320
that they're struggling with it,

2673
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,960
but I think the future of this kind of discussion

2674
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,040
resides in finding more compelling ways

2675
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,480
of communicating the truth

2676
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,520
to people who aren't used to hearing it.

2677
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,000
I hope in some way this video has helped.

2678
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,560
In the meantime, while we figure out

2679
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,440
how to convince people who seem committed

2680
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,840
to being never convinced,

2681
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,000
at least the vaccine intended for them

2682
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,280
can go to someone who's sure they want it.

2683
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,080
Specifically, me.

2684
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,040
Please send me their vaccine.

2685
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,280
I was glad they were testing it on the old people first,

2686
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,840
but it's been months now, and I want it.

2687
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,520
I want to go outside.

2688
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,920
Be able to go outside.

2689
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,160
I want to pretend I shop at Waitrose again.

2690
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,440
I want to use my free football tickets.

2691
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,280
I want to taunt my former hairdresser

2692
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,040
with how useless she is to me now

2693
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,560
and threaten to turn her building

2694
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,320
back into a research foundation.

2695
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,960
Give me the vaccine, doctor.

2696
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,280
Hell, give me all of them.

2697
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,840
Let me combine their power.

2698
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,120
Soon I will be unstoppable.

2699
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,080
It's easy to get depressed and begin to believe

2700
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,440
that you're basically locked in a room

2701
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,360
with thousands of fucking idiots

2702
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,640
who are just willing to say stupid shit constantly,

2703
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:15,560
just committed to just being wrong,

2704
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:19,440
but actually, the more I think about it,

2705
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,960
I'm actually locked in a planet

2706
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,720
with millions of people who do know better than these people,

2707
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,760
but they're just so busy being depressed like me at them.

2708
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,160
Maybe the answer here is that we just need to accept

2709
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,920
that we should put the depression energy

2710
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,320
into making a difference,

2711
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:37,640
into changing the minds of the people who can be,

2712
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:40,520
and into doing what we can to improve the state of our world

2713
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,040
around these people,

2714
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,880
and just let them be mad

2715
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,960
and let them continue to be stupid,

2716
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,160
but in a world where their kids won't die of polio

2717
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,360
because we got rid of it for them.

2718
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,840
Good for them, ignorant little wankers,

2719
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,240
because maybe the hard thing to do

2720
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,040
when we're confronted by the scope of these problems

2721
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:00,440
is accept that we really can do something about it.

2722
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:03,520
No matter how hopeless things may seem,

2723
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,840
the world always can get better,

2724
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,720
and maybe together,

2725
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,560
someday, we can invent a way

2726
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,400
of cleaning up this fucking mess in my mom's garage,

2727
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,400
in my garage.

2728
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,720
Hey, thank you for watching.

2729
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,960
That was pretty good, wasn't it?

2730
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,280
I managed to avoid getting too preachy at the end there.

2731
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,400
I'd like to thank my patrons,

2732
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,080
whose names are scrolling past the screen right now.

2733
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,800
You guys literally keep the lights on.

2734
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,400
I'd like to thank the sensitivity reader

2735
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,720
who took a look at some of the segments

2736
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,520
and made sure that we were using the appropriate language

2737
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,720
when we were talking about autism.

2738
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,680
I'd also really like to thank Brian Deer,

2739
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,680
who's basically a superhero.

2740
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,920
He's the guy who found out most of this stuff,

2741
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,360
really saved the day,

2742
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,120
and just thank you so much, man.

2743
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,120
And also, while we were making this video,

2744
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,520
Brian Deer released a book about the whole thing.

2745
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,520
Deer's book,

2746
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,920
the Doctor Who Fooled the World,

2747
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,200
is basically the most definitive source

2748
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,200
on Andrew Wakefield and all the damage he did.

2749
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,040
I literally cannot recommend it enough

2750
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,600
if the topic interests you at all.

2751
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,040
Deer is by far the most knowledgeable person

2752
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,200
on everything that happened.

2753
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,440
I mean, he's the guy who discovered

2754
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,680
most of it himself through actual decades

2755
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,080
of investigative reporting.

2756
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:34,840
I had no idea he was doing a book

2757
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,080
until it came out when I was writing this video,

2758
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,080
and with that,

2759
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,880
it came out when I was writing this video,

2760
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,480
and we just barely scratched the surface

2761
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,480
of the stuff he covers.

2762
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,180
There's a link to his site in the description,

2763
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,820
and it's not an affiliate link or anything.

2764
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,280
We're not being paid to do this.

2765
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,720
I've decided he deserves your money.

2766
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,120
I want him to be able to chart the release of this video

2767
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,760
on a graph of his sales figures.

2768
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,460
That's my personal fantasy.

2769
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:56,860
Tell him Hbomb says hi.

2770
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,860
If you want to know more about this whole topic

2771
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:02,660
or just check out Brian Deer's honestly heroic reporting,

2772
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,300
you should really go read his book

2773
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:06,440
and go to briandeer.com

2774
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,500
because it survived the lawsuit

2775
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,040
and there's some great stuff there.

2776
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,880
So thanks to Kat for doing all of that additional research

2777
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,480
and for co-writing a lot of these segments

2778
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,280
and just generally fact-checking me.

2779
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,840
I got a lot of facts wrong,

2780
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,640
and I'd like to thank my, uh, intern, Rachel,

2781
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:23,280
uh, who did great work with the camera.

2782
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,520
Don't do that.

2783
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:27,020
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

2784
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,560
Oh, wow, there are more credits.

2785
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,560
Oh, my God.

2786
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,560
Thank you so much for being

2787
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,560
so patient with this video.

2788
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,560
I'm actually surprised

2789
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,560
we got it done so quickly, to be honest.

2790
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,700
We had a whole production.

2791
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,420
Like, we had to work with fact-checkers,

2792
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:39,120
lawyers in two different countries

2793
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,500
to make sure we couldn't get sued

2794
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,160
for anything we were saying about these people

2795
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,400
because, you know, you might have noticed

2796
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,560
some of the characters in this story are litigious.

2797
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,900
We conferred with vaccine experts,

2798
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,700
doctors, science communicators,

2799
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,840
medical researchers, sensitivity readers, animators.

2800
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,180
You know, someone had to draw the internal anatomy

2801
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,180
for that one thing.

2802
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,720
I made an award-winning cartoonist

2803
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,620
for the New Yorker spend hours of her life

2804
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,780
drawing the courtroom from Phoenix Wright

2805
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,940
for a joke that went by in, like, 10 seconds.

2806
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,340
Sorry about that, by the way,

2807
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:09,780
and my poor, long-suffering producer, Kat,

2808
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:11,540
had to coordinate most of this for me

2809
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:13,820
because I was busy editing the actual video,

2810
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,020
and thank you to my patrons

2811
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,620
for watching an early draft of this

2812
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,620
and giving me feedback.

2813
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,780
It turns out a bunch of people

2814
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:20,820
who watch my videos are, like, scientists,

2815
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,620
so we got some really good notes from them.

2816
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,160
All in all, I'm pretty happy

2817
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,560
with how this video turned out,

2818
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,060
so, yeah, that's nice.

2819
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:28,760
That said, I'm never putting this much effort

2820
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,100
into a video again.

2821
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,100
Forget it.

2822
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:42,360
♪♪

2823
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,140
Can you believe that Brian David Gilbert

2824
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,140
did voices in this video?

2825
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:46,800
That's great. It's amazing.

2826
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,240
He sent me just video footage

2827
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,840
of him dressed as Andrew Wakefield.

2828
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,080
I didn't ask for him to do that.

2829
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,440
He just sent that to me.

2830
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,820
Like, what a cool guy.

2831
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:54,820
That was great.

2832
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,460
Oh!

2833
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:03,500
Oh!

2834
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
Oh!
