Zzzzzz-

00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,260
Nnggh!

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,840
Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,800
Good evening, fellow brain-mind-explordinares!

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,360
Harris Bomberguy here!

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,300
Uh! Ugh!

8
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,760
Mm!

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,760
If there's one thing everyone knows about me,

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,360
it's that I love how corporations and branding

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,060
utterly dominate our culture.

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,340
The golden arches, the Nike tick,

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,440
the...whatever distinctive thing Burger King has.

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,300
These familiar designs help remind me I'm alive,

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,900
and the dopamine that pours from their food pipe

16
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,000
is like the warm embrace of an attractive friend,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,300
with maybe some benefits if they pity you enough.

18
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,400
And golly, isn't it great when companies extol ideas

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,360
that accord with my own values?

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,060
It's like helping to spread a positive message

21
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,800
and make the world a better place.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,200
And to show my support,

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,600
I bought a bunch of their stuff online.

24
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,160
I mean, you've got to support the heroes

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
fighting for the right cause.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
After all, in what other way can we actually voice support

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,360
for making the world better in a society

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,600
where corporations have far more power

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
over our world than any of the people

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
who actually have to live in it?

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
Oh, that's depressing.

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,700
That's not going to be the point of the video, is it?

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,200
The history of advertising,

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,700
according to what I remember from high school media studies.

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,160
Advertising has taken place for most of human history,

37
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,860
but with the invention of the printing press

38
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,500
and popularization of the newspaper,

39
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,560
it really took off.

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,260
Even as early as the 1800s,

41
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,860
you couldn't read your paper for updates

42
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,460
about the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,860
without some little fucker telling you about his bovril.

44
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,360
Invaluable to invalids and weak persons.

45
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
You can't say that.

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,660
Some people think of advertisements

47
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,660
as value-neutral.

48
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,960
It's just a piece of paper

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
or some video footage conveniently letting you know

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,160
about a thing that exists and what it does

51
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,060
so you can make an informed decision

52
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,860
about your potential purchase.

53
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,660
Sam, I don't have to cut myself to shave clothes.

54
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,260
This is the track two, the two-bladed razor from Gillette.

55
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,260
The blades are recessed so it's safer.

56
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,360
Because as we know,

57
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,760
humans are perfectly rational actors.

58
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,560
After all, capitalism works

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
because it's just in everyone's rational self-interest

60
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,860
to make a really good product.

61
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,160
No, wait, hang on. I forgot about human psychology.

62
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,760
You can just trick people into buying things.

63
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,260
Oops.

♪♪

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
It turns out that it's possible to convince people

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
to do things they wouldn't do otherwise

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
and probably shouldn't.

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Advertising is really a large collection

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,560
of people trying to find the most effective way

70
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,160
of getting you to give your money to their bosses

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,260
to buy their thing.

72
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,860
It's a massive and very lucrative industry.

73
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,860
To put it the way this old cigarette commercial did,

74
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,160
we're gonna get ya.

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,260
One of the most effective ways to sell a product

76
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,660
is to tie it to someone's sense of value or their goals.

77
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,860
Owning this product will prove you're a successful person.

78
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,760
This product will make you irresistible

79
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,960
to women we made up.

80
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,860
Ooh!

81
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,660
Oh!

82
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,860
Maybe if you ate at a fast food restaurant more,

83
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,060
your children would love you, you piece of shit!

84
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,460
But the problem is this doesn't work forever.

85
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,660
Advertising has become more and more ubiquitous

86
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,760
and audiences stop paying attention to commercials

87
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,160
when they're a lot like ones they've seen

88
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,560
thousands of times before.

89
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,860
You have to push these ideas harder and harder

90
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,760
for them to work.

91
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,460
Over time, commercials became more and more brazen

92
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,060
in associating their products with power and sex

93
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,560
until it became so weird

94
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,860
it's almost indistinguishable from a joke.

95
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,560
Take this classic Big Mac poster

96
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,860
where the burger's on a red velvet bed

97
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,360
and it says,

98
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,860
stop staring at me like I'm some piece of meat.

99
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,360
Are you Mac enough?

100
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,560
Like, man enough?

101
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,160
Like, are you enough of a masculine manly man-man

102
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,860
to get into bed with this burger

103
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,660
and just go to town with your mouth?

104
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,560
But you are a piece of meat.

105
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,160
I—

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,260
Oh, I'm supposed to fuck this burger.

107
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,860
Duh-duh!

108
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
Duh-duh-duh!

109
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,760
By this point, advertisers had drilled so far down

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,060
into the human id,

111
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,460
they'd gone too far,

112
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,560
broken through all pre-existing Freudian evo-psych theories

113
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,960
and entered directly into the darkness of the human mind more,

114
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,860
to the place where you're paying a supermodel

115
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,560
to pretend to eat a burger in her bikini at the beach

116
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,060
because maybe horny viewers will want to do a sex so badly

117
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,260
they'll get hungry for a teriyaki burger.

118
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,360
God, that burger is definitely covered in sand at this point.

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,460
It would probably improve the flavor, though.

120
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
I love that the camera keeps cutting away

121
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,660
before any of it ever goes in her mouth

122
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,160
because it's basically poison.

123
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,260
No, don't eat the pineapple! It's evil! Don't!

124
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,460
So it was clear to advertisers that a new strategy was required.

125
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,660
Sex might sell,

126
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,860
but it doesn't stand out amongst a crowd of sex.

127
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,960
If you want people to pay attention,

128
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,860
you have to do something truly different.

129
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,260
["Cool Law"]

130
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,060
["Cool Law"]

131
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,760
Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...

132
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,460
Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch...

133
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
This UK commercial for Apple Earphones

134
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,760
is incredibly memorable,

135
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,060
even a decade later.

136
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,660
It's probably in the top three most well-known pieces

137
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,160
of video footage ever to grace our little aisles,

138
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
just behind the old Smash commercials

139
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
and the bit where Del Boy falls through the bar.

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,660
It's so weird and devoid of anything you'd expect from an ad

141
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,260
that it grabs your attention in a completely new way.

142
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,160
It's so memorable, except, of course,

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
for the part where it wasn't a commercial for earphones.

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
I made that up. It was for Cadbury's chocolate,

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,560
you gormless rube!

146
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,060
The last decade of marketing school graduates

147
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,160
are people who saw commercials like this

148
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
and the power and memorability they had

149
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,660
and went, yeah, I can do that exactly like that.

150
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,460
I'm gonna be weird, too.

151
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,760
But the problem with everyone trying to be weird

152
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,460
and different and stand out all at the same time

153
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,560
is they kind of all stopped standing out,

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
like, immediately.

155
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,560
So tons of commercials nowadays are just super out there

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,760
and bizarre and have nothing to do with the product,

157
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,660
but you still don't really notice or care

158
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,260
because you're already attuned to it.

159
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,060
Nowadays, the only ads that stand out

160
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,360
are, like, the ones that are just so bad

161
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
that you remember them to make fun of them.

162
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,660
Let's do that now!

163
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,560
Remember the shit Hydrobot?

164
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,660
Hydrobot at it again!

165
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,960
Who you remember specifically because

166
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
it's a really awkward and terrible way

167
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,360
of promoting...anything?

168
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,960
I don't think they sold many products

169
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,260
off the back of this thing.

170
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,060
People just remember it because...

171
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,860
Transformers razor.

172
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,260
You're gonna shave yourself with a razor

173
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,760
that's gonna fucking turn into a car

174
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,860
and cut your fucking face off?

175
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,560
Free your skin!

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,860
I do not want to free my skin!

177
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,960
What? What?

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
But worse than that,

179
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
this goes a layer deeper.

180
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,660
Remember the shit Hydrosilk robot?

181
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,260
You probably didn't because you've had

182
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,360
a trillion other deeply stupid things

183
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,560
flashed directly into your cortex.

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,460
But I remember it all.

185
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,860
I remember it, so you don't have to...

186
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,860
KILL ME!

187
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,260
Shick Hydrosilk.

188
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,660
Free your skin! Free your skin!

189
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,760
This commercial is currently unlisted

190
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,860
from Shick Hydrosilk's channel.

191
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
I can't imagine why.

192
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,360
With the creation of this, uh...

193
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,260
Titty Robot Adventure commercial,

194
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,260
it's clear that all pre-existing methods

195
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,360
of advertising are failing to work that well.

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
Plus, in a way, for the first time in a while,

197
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,160
there are less venues to advertise to people now

198
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
than there used to be.

199
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,760
A lot of people don't really watch television anymore

200
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
and consume content on their computers

201
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,360
with ad blockers enabled, the cowards!

202
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
If you use an ad blocker,

203
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
you're basically snatching the soy

204
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
from my savoring mouth!

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
Whenever a successful method

206
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
of getting your brand attention is found,

207
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
it's swiftly copied and repeated,

208
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,060
quickly rendering it useless.

209
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,460
The fastest cycle I've seen

210
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,560
is with the trend of weird brand Twitter,

211
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
like Wendy's having a go at people,

212
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
or Arby's making funny cardboard things,

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,660
or Sunny Delight's recent depression tweet.

214
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,860
These are meant to make the brand seem personal

215
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,060
and ironic and not like a corporation

216
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,860
who wants your attention and money,

217
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,460
but to a trained eye, they do the opposite.

218
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,860
A sizable company's not letting their media managers

219
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,260
run their accounts in this manner

220
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,260
unless they've done painstaking market research

221
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,060
and found it to be beneficial to do.

222
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,960
And what's more, since it's literally free to do this,

223
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,660
every even vaguely savvy brand's getting in on it,

224
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,860
which has swiftly made it a saturated format

225
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
that bores people and makes it lose the sense

226
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,260
that this is in any way unique.

227
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,560
I mean, if fucking Corn Nuts are getting in on it now,

228
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
it's not gonna work anymore.

229
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,860
Corn Nuts, the world's most underrated snack.

230
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,160
That's one way to channel the fact people don't like you.

231
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,760
Soon, it'll be so ubiquitous

232
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
that people just tune it out,

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,860
like all regular advertisements,

234
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,460
which means marketing companies are looking for a new way

235
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,760
to push their products into your consciousness,

236
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,760
and they've found it in a very strange place.

237
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,560
And it technically happened by accident.

238
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,160
Pfft.

239
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,660
Keurig.

240
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,560
Is it Keurig or is it Keurig?

241
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,660
Keurig?

242
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,260
Ugh, it's just—it's fine.

243
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,960
Look, I already recorded this bit,

244
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,260
so if I pronounce it wrong, whatever.

245
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,260
In late 2017, when American talk show host Sean Hannity

246
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,760
came to the defense of Roy Moore...

247
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,460
Everyone would agree. Everybody.

248
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,960
A 32-year-old man pursuing a 14-year-old girl is disgusting.

249
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,860
That is something we should all agree on.

250
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,660
This should transcend politics.

251
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,260
However...

252
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,360
...Media Matters president Angelo Caruso—

253
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,260
Wait, what if it's pronounced Carusoni?

254
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,460
Oh, I should have checked.

255
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,960
—among others asked coffee machine company Keurig

256
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,160
to reconsider sponsoring Hannity's show,

257
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,860
and Keurig responded by tweeting

258
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,360
that they were pulling their advertising.

259
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,560
At least four other companies pulled advertising

260
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,460
from Hannity's show for supporting Moore,

261
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,860
but Keurig visibly tweeting about doing it

262
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,260
and it getting a very large and vocal response

263
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,060
and support for having done it

264
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,560
caused a lot of sudden reactions.

265
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,960
In one corner of the Internet,

266
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,460
people were suddenly thinking about

267
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,160
buying a Keurig coffee machine.

268
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,460
I mean, they made a stand.

269
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
Uh, in a very minor way.

270
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,160
In another corner, marketing people, ad people,

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
people whose job is to see what causes this kind of splash

272
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,460
started watching closely and taking notes.

273
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,060
And in the saddest corner,

274
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,260
Hannity fans went berserk.

275
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,960
Oh!

276
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,660
Hope you're happy, Keurig.

277
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,160
Oh, yeah, that'll show them.

278
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
This video, published on the 12th of November,

279
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,760
one day after Keurig's tweet,

280
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,460
of self-appointed red pill aficionado

281
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,760
Angelo John Gage destroying his Keurig coffee machine

282
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,160
and making a huge mess of his garage in his pajamas.

283
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,260
Ah, but don't worry, he's wearing socks with his flip-flops,

284
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,260
so he's protected.

285
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Has a shit ton of likes and retweets

286
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,560
and sparked hashtag Boycott Keurig,

287
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,460
a sort of pseudo-protest movement

288
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,960
where right-wing people, shocked and upset

289
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,060
that a company wouldn't give money to someone they watch

290
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,460
to sell them something they already own,

291
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,460
destroy their expensive, functioning coffee machines

292
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,560
they bought to spite the company

293
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,260
for this horrendous slight?

294
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,560
Uh, this, internally for Keurig,

295
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
was initially thought of as a terrible accident.

296
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,960
All these angry people harassing Keurig employees

297
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,560
and even the brief, though ultimately insignificant,

298
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
stink of a boycott, but secretly,

299
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,760
everyone was looking at how much attention

300
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Keurig was getting.

301
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,060
You know what shows up a lot when there's a big hashtag

302
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,360
about boycotting Keurig going around for days?

303
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,660
The word Keurig.

304
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,360
The story about what Keurig did

305
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,560
and how people feel about it.

306
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,860
And it turns out that this is very similar to marketing.

307
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,560
Some people want to support Keurig

308
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,760
for the nice thing they did.

309
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,960
I mean, they took a stand by pulling some ads

310
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,760
from one TV show for a while.

311
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,960
And then there's the people who suddenly realized

312
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,760
that they could do with a coffee machine

313
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,560
since everyone's talking about them lately.

314
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,860
And then there's the flip side of almost every boycott,

315
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,660
which is the people who destroyed the thing that they own

316
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,760
realizing that they quite liked it

317
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
and, hey, no one's really paying attention

318
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,060
to whether or not I obey this boycott or not,

319
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,660
so maybe I'll just get another one.

320
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,760
It doesn't really make a big difference.

321
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,460
And then, of course, there's the simple fact

322
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,660
that people don't tend to go on with boycotts for very long.

323
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,060
It happens.

324
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,460
I hate to break it to you, but if you ever destroyed

325
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,660
something that you own as part of a protest

326
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,260
against a company's actions,

327
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,160
statistically, you bought another one.

328
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,760
And then you bought an extra one for one of your 2.14 kids.

329
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,060
Probably Kevin.

330
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,760
He gets all the nice things, doesn't he?

331
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,160
What's wrong with me, mother?

332
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Don't you love me anymore?

333
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,560
Sure, it's hilarious.

334
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,260
These people are deeply foolish,

335
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,460
and it's good on some level

336
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,960
that sometimes advertisers don't support purveyors

337
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,560
of a garbage ideology,

338
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
but on the serious side,

339
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,860
the analysts watching and waiting in the background

340
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,460
learned an interesting lesson.

341
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,960
All of this is a goldmine.

342
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,060
It's more than a commercial.

343
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,760
It's a real-mercial.

344
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
That's my word. I just coined it.

345
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
Attribute it to me. Put it in the dictionary.

346
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,260
When you're the focus of a discussion online,

347
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,760
when you're a hashtag millions can click on and check out,

348
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,260
when you are the conversation for a brief moment

349
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,160
that everyone feels expected to think about and have a take,

350
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,760
not even an ad block can hide you.

351
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Not even someone who doesn't watch TV

352
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,160
can miss your message.

353
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,760
The exposure was massive,

354
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,260
and it was effectively free.

355
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,660
And...I'm sorry.

356
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,460
I just need to stop for a second

357
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,860
to acknowledge how hilarious it is

358
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,760
that the guy, like, couldn't frame it properly

359
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,860
with his vertical phone video,

360
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,660
so it keeps falling out of the fucking frame.

361
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,360
Oh, Jesus.

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
When I saw this, I told myself,

363
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,260
the next time something like this happens,

364
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,060
it won't be an accident.

365
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Nike.

366
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
For those of you who aren't aware,

367
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,160
it's pronounced Nike.

368
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,660
That's all right. I'm getting all high and mighty

369
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,460
about how to pronounce the one I know how to pronounce.

370
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,960
Just leave me alone.

371
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,360
In September of last year,

372
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,160
Nike pulled the trigger on a new commercial

373
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,960
celebrating 30 years of their Just Do It slogan.

374
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,060
The ad featured many great and famous athletes,

375
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,860
but also featured and was narrated by Colin Kaepernick.

376
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,160
Colin was 30 at the time,

377
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,860
which made him the same age as the slogan,

378
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,660
which was neat.

379
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,860
I guess he's always been the same age as the slogan.

380
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,560
How does time work?

381
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,460
This is a kind of cool commercial.

382
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,660
It's encouraging.

383
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,860
It prominently features

384
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,260
and celebrates black athletes for their success,

385
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,860
and it tacitly endorses Kaepernick's activism,

386
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,860
which goes a little beyond kneeling, by the way.

387
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,760
He's done a lot of work and given a lot of support

388
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,960
to organizations that do some really great stuff.

389
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,760
This is 100% the most tasteful

390
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,260
and inspiring shoe commercial

391
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,660
I've ever seen in my life.

392
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
But the commercial's content or quality

393
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,860
wasn't really the point.

394
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,060
The point was what happened next,

395
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,360
and we all knew what was gonna happen next.

396
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,660
Everyone who you can expect to be mad

397
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,060
about people protesting police brutality

398
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,860
got mad, and in a show of impotent rage

399
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,460
at a shoe company

400
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,060
for making bad commercial Mino-like,

401
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,060
destroyed some of their personal property

402
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,360
and started the hashtag

403
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
burnyournikes

404
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,460
and tried to start a boycott.

405
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,960
Our sound man just cut the Nike swoosh off his socks.

406
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,260
Former Marine.

407
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,460
Get ready, Nike.

408
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,660
Multiply that by the millions.

409
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,860
Looks like he's never used scissors before.

410
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,560
Nah, he was just so wound up,

411
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,060
he didn't take time.

412
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,360
It's a wonder he didn't cut himself.

413
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,960
You think we'll roll over on shit like this?

414
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,760
My troop friend was so mad at his socks,

415
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,060
he couldn't even—

416
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,460
Not only am I burning my favorite pair of Nikes,

417
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,560
you are burning your sales.

418
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
You think that's gonna happen?

419
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Over here, in reality,

420
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,060
these bizarre, property-immolating protests

421
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,460
against Nike for daring to feature a man

422
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,660
who said police brutality was bad

423
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,560
made everyone want to talk about Nike

424
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,760
and how cool they were being

425
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,260
and make fun of these people

426
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,760
for days on end.

427
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,560
Nike was being given

428
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,260
hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising

429
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,960
by people trying to punish them.

430
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,460
Nike's value went up by—

431
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,660
Are you ready for this?

432
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,960
Six billion dollars.

433
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,760
By jolly, governor,

434
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,760
that's a lot of shoes.

435
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,560
Why did I do that?

436
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
And they couldn't have done it

437
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,960
without dozens of sad little boys

438
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,460
telling you just how much

439
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,060
birdbrained little shitheads like them hate Nike.

440
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,960
Congratulations, kid.

441
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,460
Throwing this in the fire

442
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,660
because of Colin Kaepernick

443
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,960
is now the face of Nike.

444
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,560
Take this, Nike.

445
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,060
Take this, Nike.

446
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,560
He thinks he's hurting Nike by doing this.

447
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
Six billion dollars.

448
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,960
Six billion dollars.

449
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,060
Five pairs of shoes in there,

450
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,560
all gonna let them—

451
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,060
Five pairs of shoes!

452
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,860
He bought one of those, like, three days ago, right?

453
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,160
You can still wear them.

454
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
You can just not buy more!

455
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,260
He can't even shut the fucking thing properly!

456
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,660
And the National Anthem's fucking blaring!

457
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,960
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

458
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
Fuck!

459
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,060
It's so good!

460
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,860
I forgot how good it is!

461
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,960
Ah-ha-ha!

462
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
So if these angry losers,

463
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,760
almost accidentally stabbing themselves

464
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,560
or giving themselves third-degree burns

465
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,160
in protest against their functioning property,

466
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,860
were trying to disincentivize support for progressive ideas,

467
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,460
they accidentally did the opposite.

468
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,660
Instead, they guaranteed it would happen again.

469
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Oops!

470
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,460
Which brings us to Gillette.

471
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,360
Although, given my luck, it's pronounced

472
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,160
Gillette-y.

473
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,360
On the 13th of January,

474
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,260
Gillette released a commercial entitled

475
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,660
We Believe the Best Men Can Be.

476
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,060
Sorry, not a commercial.

477
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,460
A short film.

478
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,260
It's about how sexism is bad

479
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,360
and you shouldn't follow women around in the street

480
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,860
when they're minding their own business

481
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,760
and don't let your kid hit other kids.

482
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,960
You know, like, basic stuff.

483
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,460
It's a piece that encourages men to improve themselves

484
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
in the really hard way,

485
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,860
where you question your ingrained behaviors

486
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,960
and think about how to encourage better ones.

487
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,160
It's not the sort of self-improvement advice

488
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,860
men tend to get, frankly.

489
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,560
It's quite hard to pass this sort of thing at first

490
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,460
when you've spent your life being told the solution

491
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,860
is to clean your room,

492
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,760
go to the gym,

493
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
and convince yourself that being shitty to people

494
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,460
is actually charisma and proves you have

495
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,060
more of a personality than them.

496
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,660
The response was...

497
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,360
predictable.

498
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,560
It's almost as if they intended for it

499
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,360
and that was the point

500
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,760
and they wanted it to happen.

501
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,260
Stable, clever boys and a few girls

502
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,060
from all over the internet emerged

503
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,960
to provide an example of their version

504
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,260
of masculinity in action

505
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,860
by screaming and crying

506
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,660
that a commercial said sexism was bad.

507
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,460
The commercial itself, anything it said or did,

508
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,760
didn't really matter.

509
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,560
A commercial gets shown a couple of times

510
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,760
and then it goes away.

511
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
What really mattered was this behavior.

512
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,360
It made Gillette the talk of the internet

513
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,960
for several full days

514
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
as all of the rights, thought, leaders,

515
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,760
bit of a misnomer, they don't seem to have had any yet,

516
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,960
all emerged to have their own personal

517
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
two-minute hate tweetstorm at Gillette,

518
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,060
not realizing that they were the actual commercial

519
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,160
for Gillette.

520
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,960
The Gillette commercial is the product

521
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,260
of mainstream radicalized feminism

522
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,460
and emblematic of

523
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,360
CULTURAL MARXISM.

524
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,660
It's actually pronounced

525
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,960
Stop perverting masculinity.

526
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,860
Let little boys wrestle.

527
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm sorry, Candace. It's too late.

528
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
The Marxists are going door to door

529
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,160
and preventing boys from wrestling.

530
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,960
Now, I could just laugh at these rubbish tweets

531
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,060
for another 20 minutes,

532
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,760
but instead we're gonna cut right

533
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,660
to the funniest one of them all.

534
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
An account named War Room tweeted,

535
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,060
Goodbye Gillette. Hello Schick.

536
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh, sweet. Another gentleman ready to

537
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
free his skin.

538
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
This tweet was connected to a picture he'd taken

539
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,560
of his Gillette razor floating in a toilet.

540
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,060
It was shared pretty widely,

541
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,860
so apparently this counts as a form of protest now,

542
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,560
but I can't help but imagine

543
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,060
the few seconds that happened

544
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,760
after this picture was taken.

545
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,560
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

546
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,360
This'll show him. Heh, heh.

547
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,760
Oh.

548
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,960
I have to get the razor out of the toilet now.

549
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,160
I have to reach into the toilet with my hands

550
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
and take it out.

551
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
I should have thought a bit harder about this,

552
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,960
shouldn't I?

553
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,860
I can't stop marveling at the majesty of it.

554
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,960
Speaking briefly,

555
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,160
as a man whose body is in, like,

556
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,660
the top 90 percentiles of testosterone,

557
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,560
I've checked.

558
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
That's why I'm gonna be bald by I'm 28.

559
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,860
Look forward to that, future subscribers.

560
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,960
I really don't get it.

561
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
I don't make a habit of questioning

562
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,460
other people's masculinity

563
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,260
because I think the concept is

564
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,560
super murky and basically made up

565
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,860
and nothing's to be gained from that,

566
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,260
but I do think there is a statement here

567
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,160
about the status of modern Western men

568
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,960
in the fact that millions of them

569
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
seemingly dropped fucking everything

570
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,160
to be mad at a commercial.

571
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,860
Like, what the fuck?

572
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,160
Aren't we supposed to be hunting the mammoth?

573
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,860
Like, screaming at Gillette

574
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,460
doesn't feed the tribe,

575
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,360
you fucking low-T baiter.

576
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,560
I can say that, by the way,

577
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
because I have more and I'm going bald.

578
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,760
I have to wear it so I get to make the joke.

579
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,560
Fuck you!

580
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Anyway, Gillette, Keurig, and Nike

581
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
all successfully boosted their products

582
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,860
and their image by way of relying on

583
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,060
backlash from weirdos, and it worked.

584
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,960
They probably all made quite a lot of sales,

585
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,360
which reminds me.

586
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,860
My box of stuff from all of my favorite

587
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,360
progressive-sounding companies arrived.

588
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Ooh, I wonder what's in it.

589
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,660
What's this?

590
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,460
That's weird.

591
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,960
I'm not sure what this is.

592
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,160
What could it possibly be?

593
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,060
Oh, it's child labor.

594
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,260
♪♪

595
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,160
Aw, yeah, here it comes, baby.

596
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,460
The generic 10-minute rant about how capitalism is bad

597
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
that I do at the end of every video now.

598
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,260
That's right, I made yet another video

599
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,660
to turn out to secretly be all about capitalism.

600
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,560
You thought I couldn't do it, but I did.

601
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,160
Don't ever question me again!

602
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,660
You don't need me to lecture you

603
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,160
through Nike's history of sweatshop labor

604
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,660
or their ongoing allegations of poor work conditions

605
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,460
often pulling production from factories

606
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,760
that threaten to unionize

607
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,860
and refusing to let the Workers' Rights Consortium

608
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,160
inspect their factories.

609
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,460
You don't need me to go into exacting detail

610
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,560
about Gillette's owners, Procter & Gamble,

611
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,660
a giant corporation who are implicated

612
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,760
in all kinds of stuff,

613
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,460
or the general way big businesses

614
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,260
are unethical on so many levels.

615
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,460
I'm not even gonna get into the pink tax,

616
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,960
the way companies like Gillette

617
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,060
can often say vaguely progressive things

618
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,960
but will happily charge women more

619
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,660
for effectively the same product

620
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,360
if they think they can get away with it.

621
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
And don't even get me started on Keurig.

622
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,160
Their coffee isn't very nice.

623
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,260
And also a bunch of labor violations.

624
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
You know most of this stuff happens already,

625
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,860
and we all know it's bad.

626
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm not saying you should personally feel bad

627
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,160
for buying the products of these companies either.

628
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Almost every company has something

629
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,460
in their production chain which,

630
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,560
if you sat and looked at it,

631
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,060
you'd probably find unethical.

632
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,260
That's the world we live in,

633
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,960
and we don't change it by feeling bad

634
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,660
about our tacit participation.

635
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,760
We change it by trying to find ways

636
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,360
of altering the way things are.

637
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
The point here is that businesses exist

638
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
to make money.

639
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,260
Sometimes that's in the form of moving jobs

640
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,860
to a country that does it cheaper,

641
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,660
often because they don't have to treat

642
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,760
their workers as well.

643
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,260
Sometimes it's in the form of fiddling

644
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,360
their taxes so much that not only did they

645
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,760
pay less taxes than you,

646
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,360
you technically paid them.

647
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,160
Sometimes it's in the form of charging women

648
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,360
more for pink razors,

649
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,460
and sometimes it's in finding new ways

650
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,760
to make you think about buying their product.

651
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,960
These clips sound nice.

652
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,560
Inspirational, even.

653
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,260
They say things that not only do I agree with,

654
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,760
but which I think are normal

655
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,360
and not in the slightest bit radical.

656
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
But they're commercials.

657
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,860
Their purpose is to sell you things.

658
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,360
They're a marketing strategy

659
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,960
with little to no impact on the actual problems

660
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,260
that threaten our world.

661
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,760
I mean, heck, they won't even admit

662
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,060
their commercials are commercials anymore.

663
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,860
They're short films.

664
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,860
It's got a cinematic aspect ratio,

665
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,160
so you know it's classy and not an ad.

666
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,360
There's this sequence where they play

667
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,060
an old Gillette ad and symbolically

668
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,360
break through it as if to surpass it,

669
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,660
but this is all window dressing designed to disguise

670
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,060
that you are being sold something.

671
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,660
It's really insidious to me how completely

672
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,560
companies are trying to mask the fact

673
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,960
that that's what they're doing.

674
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,460
They're still just trying to find a way to get you,

675
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,860
and it turns out that people don't go

676
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,560
for hiring a model to pretend to eat

677
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,360
a sandy pineapple burger anymore.

678
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,760
They go for something that sounds

679
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,660
really progressive and forward-thinking

680
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,160
and that all the weirdos on Twitter

681
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,460
seem to be mad about.

682
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,260
It's just like dear old dad always used to tell me.

683
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,060
Son, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.

684
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Actually, that's a lie.

685
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,860
That's my fantasy.

686
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,360
Dad mostly just sat in the corner

687
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,860
and read Victor Klemperer books.

688
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,760
But I'm the Victor Klemperer of my age, father!

689
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,360
I tell everyone which video games are bad!

690
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,260
Brands are not our friends,

691
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,060
but it is nice, isn't it?

692
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
I mean, I can make fun of people for buying razors

693
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,660
just to spite some weirdos online

694
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,760
or for liking a commercial or whatever,

695
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,760
but it is pretty cool that a company

696
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,260
actually invited discussion of these issues.

697
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,660
Just keep in mind that there are deeper problems

698
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,760
with these companies that we do need to talk about and solve,

699
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,460
and don't let them buy your allegiance

700
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
by saying something vaguely progressive-sounding

701
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
in a commercial.

702
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,860
Besides, there are better, less invasive,

703
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,760
more genuine ways of getting your product

704
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,560
out there to people.

705
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,660
Which brings me to CuriosityStream.

706
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,060
CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming service

707
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
that offers over 2,000 documentaries

708
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,860
and non-fiction titles from some of the world's

709
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,360
best filmmakers, including exclusive originals

710
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
made specifically for the platform.

711
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,460
It's created by John Hendricks,

712
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,160
the guy who founded the Discovery Channel,

713
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,660
and I really enjoyed a series on there

714
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,860
called History of Food,

715
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,460
which tracks the invention of cooking

716
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,460
millions of years ago,

717
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,660
the development of processes like fermentation

718
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,860
and bread-making and how this allowed civilization

719
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,260
to prosper, all the way to the modern food industry

720
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,960
and its more modern problems.

721
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,460
I am currently in the process of making a couple of videos

722
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,260
about diet science and junk diets and stuff like that,

723
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,560
so if you watch this series,

724
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,660
you'll know exactly where I stole everything from.

725
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,260
Access to everything on the platform

726
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,260
costs $2.99 a month or $19.99 a year,

727
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,560
but if you go to curiositystream.com

728
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,860
slash hbomberguy,

729
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,560
your membership will be free for the first 30 days.

730
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,060
Hey, thanks for watching the commercial

731
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,360
all the way through, too.

732
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,060
I think now would be a good time to bring up

733
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,460
that this stuff can all happen

734
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,560
in the opposite direction, too.

735
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,860
Watch out for right-wing commercials

736
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,560
that promote traditional values

737
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,460
or are weirdly loving of Donald Trump.

738
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,960
Uh, I mean, there's already, like, a watch commercial

739
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,060
that's, like, a response to the Gillette thing

740
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,260
where they're like, men have it way hard in there.

741
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,760
The next time a commercial like that comes out,

742
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
which it will because this stuff goes in any direction,

743
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,860
marketing companies know what they're doing,

744
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,460
just don't worry about it.

745
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,360
You know, like, there are so many important problems

746
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,560
in the world right now that are worth talking about

747
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,460
and worth solving,

748
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,460
and in the scheme of that,

749
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,660
commercials that say something you don't like

750
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,660
are effectively a trick to waste your time,

751
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,760
and your time is better spent than that

752
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,360
because I love you,

753
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,060
and there are people in your life right now,

754
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,960
even you, who could benefit from that time,

755
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,260
so spend it on them instead.

756
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,960
You have my permission now.

757
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,260
Heh. I guess.

758
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Um, and I hope you have a really great night.

759
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,660
Do something you enjoy.

760
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
I've been really into hummus lately.

761
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,360
Check that out, and look up cool time management skills

762
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,060
if you haven't. It turns out it's a really great thing.

763
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,460
I got this video out, like, two weeks early.

764
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,760
Um, yeah, take care of yourselves,

765
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
and, uh, have a good night,

766
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
and brands are not your friends.

767
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,360
Um, thanks, CuriosityStream, for the sponsorship.

768
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,960
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

769
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I'm screwed.

770
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,560
Uh, love yourself, and take care.

771
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Bye.

772
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,760
Oh, I also have a Patreon.

773
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Oh, I forgot to...
