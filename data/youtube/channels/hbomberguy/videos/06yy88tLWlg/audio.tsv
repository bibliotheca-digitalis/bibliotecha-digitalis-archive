2060	3100	Zzzzzz-
3100	4260	Nnggh!
4260	6840	Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!
6840	9800	Good evening, fellow brain-mind-explordinares!
9800	11360	Harris Bomberguy here!
11360	13300	Uh! Ugh!
13300	14760	Mm!
14760	16760	If there's one thing everyone knows about me,
16760	19360	it's that I love how corporations and branding
19360	21060	utterly dominate our culture.
21060	23340	The golden arches, the Nike tick,
23340	26440	the...whatever distinctive thing Burger King has.
26440	29300	These familiar designs help remind me I'm alive,
29500	31900	and the dopamine that pours from their food pipe
31900	35000	is like the warm embrace of an attractive friend,
35000	37300	with maybe some benefits if they pity you enough.
37300	40400	And golly, isn't it great when companies extol ideas
40400	42360	that accord with my own values?
42360	45060	It's like helping to spread a positive message
45060	46800	and make the world a better place.
46800	48200	And to show my support,
48200	50600	I bought a bunch of their stuff online.
50600	52160	I mean, you've got to support the heroes
52160	54000	fighting for the right cause.
54000	57500	After all, in what other way can we actually voice support
57500	59360	for making the world better in a society
59360	61600	where corporations have far more power
61600	64000	over our world than any of the people
64000	67200	who actually have to live in it?
67200	68960	Oh, that's depressing.
68960	70700	That's not going to be the point of the video, is it?
70700	73500	♪♪
73500	75200	The history of advertising,
75200	77700	according to what I remember from high school media studies.
77700	80160	Advertising has taken place for most of human history,
80160	81860	but with the invention of the printing press
81860	83500	and popularization of the newspaper,
83500	84560	it really took off.
84560	86260	Even as early as the 1800s,
86260	87860	you couldn't read your paper for updates
87860	89460	about the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War
89460	91860	without some little fucker telling you about his bovril.
91860	94360	Invaluable to invalids and weak persons.
94360	95360	You can't say that.
95360	96660	Some people think of advertisements
96660	97660	as value-neutral.
97660	98960	It's just a piece of paper
98960	101360	or some video footage conveniently letting you know
101360	104160	about a thing that exists and what it does
104160	106060	so you can make an informed decision
106060	107860	about your potential purchase.
107860	110660	Sam, I don't have to cut myself to shave clothes.
110660	113260	This is the track two, the two-bladed razor from Gillette.
113260	115260	The blades are recessed so it's safer.
115260	116360	Because as we know,
116360	118760	humans are perfectly rational actors.
118760	120560	After all, capitalism works
120560	122760	because it's just in everyone's rational self-interest
122760	124860	to make a really good product.
124860	127160	No, wait, hang on. I forgot about human psychology.
127160	128760	You can just trick people into buying things.
128760	129260	Oops.
129260	131760	♪♪
131760	134160	It turns out that it's possible to convince people
134160	136160	to do things they wouldn't do otherwise
136160	137360	and probably shouldn't.
137360	139360	Advertising is really a large collection
139360	141560	of people trying to find the most effective way
141560	144160	of getting you to give your money to their bosses
144160	145260	to buy their thing.
145260	147860	It's a massive and very lucrative industry.
147860	150860	To put it the way this old cigarette commercial did,
150860	152160	we're gonna get ya.
152160	154260	One of the most effective ways to sell a product
154260	157660	is to tie it to someone's sense of value or their goals.
157660	160860	Owning this product will prove you're a successful person.
160860	162760	This product will make you irresistible
162760	163960	to women we made up.
163960	164860	Ooh!
164860	165660	Oh!
165660	167860	Maybe if you ate at a fast food restaurant more,
167860	170060	your children would love you, you piece of shit!
170060	172460	But the problem is this doesn't work forever.
172460	174660	Advertising has become more and more ubiquitous
174660	176760	and audiences stop paying attention to commercials
176760	178160	when they're a lot like ones they've seen
178160	179560	thousands of times before.
179560	181860	You have to push these ideas harder and harder
181860	182760	for them to work.
182760	185460	Over time, commercials became more and more brazen
185460	188060	in associating their products with power and sex
188060	189560	until it became so weird
189560	191860	it's almost indistinguishable from a joke.
191860	193560	Take this classic Big Mac poster
193560	195860	where the burger's on a red velvet bed
195860	196360	and it says,
196360	198860	stop staring at me like I'm some piece of meat.
198860	200360	Are you Mac enough?
200360	201560	Like, man enough?
201560	205160	Like, are you enough of a masculine manly man-man
205160	207860	to get into bed with this burger
207860	211660	and just go to town with your mouth?
211660	213560	But you are a piece of meat.
213560	214160	I—
215360	217260	Oh, I'm supposed to fuck this burger.
217260	217860	Duh-duh!
217860	218860	Duh-duh-duh!
218860	221760	By this point, advertisers had drilled so far down
221760	223060	into the human id,
223060	224460	they'd gone too far,
224460	227560	broken through all pre-existing Freudian evo-psych theories
227560	230960	and entered directly into the darkness of the human mind more,
230960	232860	to the place where you're paying a supermodel
232860	235560	to pretend to eat a burger in her bikini at the beach
235560	239060	because maybe horny viewers will want to do a sex so badly
239060	242260	they'll get hungry for a teriyaki burger.
242260	245360	God, that burger is definitely covered in sand at this point.
245360	247460	It would probably improve the flavor, though.
247460	249460	I love that the camera keeps cutting away
249460	251660	before any of it ever goes in her mouth
251660	253160	because it's basically poison.
253160	255260	No, don't eat the pineapple! It's evil! Don't!
255260	258460	So it was clear to advertisers that a new strategy was required.
258460	259660	Sex might sell,
259660	262860	but it doesn't stand out amongst a crowd of sex.
262860	264960	If you want people to pay attention,
264960	267860	you have to do something truly different.
267860	270260	["Cool Law"]
270260	271060	["Cool Law"]
271060	273760	Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...
273760	274460	Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch...
274460	276460	This UK commercial for Apple Earphones
276460	277760	is incredibly memorable,
277760	279060	even a decade later.
279060	281660	It's probably in the top three most well-known pieces
281660	284160	of video footage ever to grace our little aisles,
284160	286160	just behind the old Smash commercials
286160	288160	and the bit where Del Boy falls through the bar.
288160	291660	It's so weird and devoid of anything you'd expect from an ad
291660	294260	that it grabs your attention in a completely new way.
294260	296160	It's so memorable, except, of course,
296160	298160	for the part where it wasn't a commercial for earphones.
298160	300160	I made that up. It was for Cadbury's chocolate,
300160	301560	you gormless rube!
301560	304060	The last decade of marketing school graduates
304060	306160	are people who saw commercials like this
306160	308360	and the power and memorability they had
308360	310660	and went, yeah, I can do that exactly like that.
310660	312460	I'm gonna be weird, too.
312460	314760	But the problem with everyone trying to be weird
314760	317460	and different and stand out all at the same time
317460	320560	is they kind of all stopped standing out,
320560	321960	like, immediately.
321960	324560	So tons of commercials nowadays are just super out there
324560	326760	and bizarre and have nothing to do with the product,
326760	328660	but you still don't really notice or care
328660	330260	because you're already attuned to it.
330260	332060	Nowadays, the only ads that stand out
332060	334360	are, like, the ones that are just so bad
334360	336360	that you remember them to make fun of them.
336360	337660	Let's do that now!
337660	339560	Remember the shit Hydrobot?
339560	341660	Hydrobot at it again!
341660	343960	Who you remember specifically because
343960	346160	it's a really awkward and terrible way
346260	348360	of promoting...anything?
348360	349960	I don't think they sold many products
349960	351260	off the back of this thing.
351260	354060	People just remember it because...
354060	355860	Transformers razor.
355860	357260	You're gonna shave yourself with a razor
357260	358760	that's gonna fucking turn into a car
358760	360860	and cut your fucking face off?
360860	362560	Free your skin!
362560	365860	I do not want to free my skin!
365860	366960	What? What?
366960	368560	But worse than that,
368560	370160	this goes a layer deeper.
370160	372660	Remember the shit Hydrosilk robot?
372660	374260	You probably didn't because you've had
374260	376360	a trillion other deeply stupid things
376360	378560	flashed directly into your cortex.
378560	380460	But I remember it all.
380460	382860	I remember it, so you don't have to...
385360	386860	KILL ME!
386860	388260	Shick Hydrosilk.
388260	390660	Free your skin! Free your skin!
390660	392760	This commercial is currently unlisted
392760	394860	from Shick Hydrosilk's channel.
394860	396860	I can't imagine why.
396860	399360	With the creation of this, uh...
399360	401260	Titty Robot Adventure commercial,
401260	403260	it's clear that all pre-existing methods
403260	405360	of advertising are failing to work that well.
405360	407560	Plus, in a way, for the first time in a while,
407560	410160	there are less venues to advertise to people now
410160	411160	than there used to be.
411160	413760	A lot of people don't really watch television anymore
413760	415760	and consume content on their computers
415760	418360	with ad blockers enabled, the cowards!
418360	419560	If you use an ad blocker,
419560	421560	you're basically snatching the soy
421560	423360	from my savoring mouth!
423360	424560	Whenever a successful method
424560	426160	of getting your brand attention is found,
426160	427760	it's swiftly copied and repeated,
427760	429060	quickly rendering it useless.
429060	430460	The fastest cycle I've seen
430460	432560	is with the trend of weird brand Twitter,
432560	434160	like Wendy's having a go at people,
434160	436560	or Arby's making funny cardboard things,
436560	438660	or Sunny Delight's recent depression tweet.
438660	440860	These are meant to make the brand seem personal
440860	443060	and ironic and not like a corporation
443060	444860	who wants your attention and money,
444860	447460	but to a trained eye, they do the opposite.
447460	449860	A sizable company's not letting their media managers
449860	451260	run their accounts in this manner
451260	453260	unless they've done painstaking market research
453260	455060	and found it to be beneficial to do.
455060	457960	And what's more, since it's literally free to do this,
457960	460660	every even vaguely savvy brand's getting in on it,
460660	462860	which has swiftly made it a saturated format
462860	464860	that bores people and makes it lose the sense
464860	466260	that this is in any way unique.
466260	469560	I mean, if fucking Corn Nuts are getting in on it now,
469560	471560	it's not gonna work anymore.
471560	474860	Corn Nuts, the world's most underrated snack.
474860	477160	That's one way to channel the fact people don't like you.
477160	478760	Soon, it'll be so ubiquitous
478760	480160	that people just tune it out,
480160	481860	like all regular advertisements,
481860	484460	which means marketing companies are looking for a new way
484460	486760	to push their products into your consciousness,
486760	489760	and they've found it in a very strange place.
489760	491560	And it technically happened by accident.
491560	492160	Pfft.
492160	493660	Keurig.
493660	495560	Is it Keurig or is it Keurig?
495560	496660	Keurig?
496660	498260	Ugh, it's just—it's fine.
498260	499960	Look, I already recorded this bit,
499960	502260	so if I pronounce it wrong, whatever.
502260	505260	In late 2017, when American talk show host Sean Hannity
505260	506760	came to the defense of Roy Moore...
506760	508460	Everyone would agree. Everybody.
508460	511960	A 32-year-old man pursuing a 14-year-old girl is disgusting.
511960	513860	That is something we should all agree on.
513860	515660	This should transcend politics.
515660	516260	However...
516260	518360	...Media Matters president Angelo Caruso—
518460	520260	Wait, what if it's pronounced Carusoni?
520260	521460	Oh, I should have checked.
521460	523960	—among others asked coffee machine company Keurig
523960	526160	to reconsider sponsoring Hannity's show,
526160	527860	and Keurig responded by tweeting
527860	529360	that they were pulling their advertising.
529360	531560	At least four other companies pulled advertising
531560	533460	from Hannity's show for supporting Moore,
533460	535860	but Keurig visibly tweeting about doing it
535860	538260	and it getting a very large and vocal response
538260	540060	and support for having done it
540060	542560	caused a lot of sudden reactions.
542560	543960	In one corner of the Internet,
543960	545460	people were suddenly thinking about
545460	547160	buying a Keurig coffee machine.
547160	549460	I mean, they made a stand.
549460	551460	Uh, in a very minor way.
551460	554160	In another corner, marketing people, ad people,
554160	557360	people whose job is to see what causes this kind of splash
557360	560460	started watching closely and taking notes.
560460	562060	And in the saddest corner,
562060	564260	Hannity fans went berserk.
564260	565960	Oh!
565960	567660	Hope you're happy, Keurig.
567660	569160	Oh, yeah, that'll show them.
569160	571160	This video, published on the 12th of November,
571160	572760	one day after Keurig's tweet,
572760	575460	of self-appointed red pill aficionado
575460	578760	Angelo John Gage destroying his Keurig coffee machine
578760	582160	and making a huge mess of his garage in his pajamas.
582160	584260	Ah, but don't worry, he's wearing socks with his flip-flops,
584260	585260	so he's protected.
585260	587260	Has a shit ton of likes and retweets
587260	589560	and sparked hashtag Boycott Keurig,
589560	591460	a sort of pseudo-protest movement
591460	593960	where right-wing people, shocked and upset
593960	597060	that a company wouldn't give money to someone they watch
597060	599460	to sell them something they already own,
599460	602460	destroy their expensive, functioning coffee machines
602460	604560	they bought to spite the company
604560	607260	for this horrendous slight?
607260	609560	Uh, this, internally for Keurig,
609560	611560	was initially thought of as a terrible accident.
611560	613960	All these angry people harassing Keurig employees
613960	616560	and even the brief, though ultimately insignificant,
616560	619560	stink of a boycott, but secretly,
619560	621760	everyone was looking at how much attention
621760	622760	Keurig was getting.
622760	625060	You know what shows up a lot when there's a big hashtag
625060	629360	about boycotting Keurig going around for days?
629360	630660	The word Keurig.
630660	632360	The story about what Keurig did
632360	634560	and how people feel about it.
634560	637860	And it turns out that this is very similar to marketing.
637860	639560	Some people want to support Keurig
639560	640760	for the nice thing they did.
640760	643960	I mean, they took a stand by pulling some ads
643960	645760	from one TV show for a while.
645760	647960	And then there's the people who suddenly realized
647960	649760	that they could do with a coffee machine
649760	651560	since everyone's talking about them lately.
651560	653860	And then there's the flip side of almost every boycott,
653860	656660	which is the people who destroyed the thing that they own
656660	658760	realizing that they quite liked it
658760	660760	and, hey, no one's really paying attention
660760	663060	to whether or not I obey this boycott or not,
663060	664660	so maybe I'll just get another one.
664660	667760	It doesn't really make a big difference.
667760	669460	And then, of course, there's the simple fact
669460	672660	that people don't tend to go on with boycotts for very long.
672660	674060	It happens.
674060	676460	I hate to break it to you, but if you ever destroyed
676460	678660	something that you own as part of a protest
678660	680260	against a company's actions,
680260	683160	statistically, you bought another one.
683160	686760	And then you bought an extra one for one of your 2.14 kids.
686760	688060	Probably Kevin.
688060	689760	He gets all the nice things, doesn't he?
689760	691160	What's wrong with me, mother?
691160	692360	Don't you love me anymore?
692360	693560	Sure, it's hilarious.
693560	695260	These people are deeply foolish,
695260	697460	and it's good on some level
697460	699960	that sometimes advertisers don't support purveyors
699960	701560	of a garbage ideology,
701560	702960	but on the serious side,
702960	705860	the analysts watching and waiting in the background
705860	707460	learned an interesting lesson.
707460	709960	All of this is a goldmine.
709960	712060	It's more than a commercial.
712060	713760	It's a real-mercial.
713760	715160	That's my word. I just coined it.
715160	716960	Attribute it to me. Put it in the dictionary.
717060	720260	When you're the focus of a discussion online,
720260	723760	when you're a hashtag millions can click on and check out,
723760	727260	when you are the conversation for a brief moment
727260	731160	that everyone feels expected to think about and have a take,
731160	733760	not even an ad block can hide you.
733760	735760	Not even someone who doesn't watch TV
735760	737160	can miss your message.
737160	738760	The exposure was massive,
738760	740260	and it was effectively free.
740260	742660	And...I'm sorry.
742660	744460	I just need to stop for a second
744460	746860	to acknowledge how hilarious it is
746860	749760	that the guy, like, couldn't frame it properly
749760	751860	with his vertical phone video,
751860	755660	so it keeps falling out of the fucking frame.
755660	757360	Oh, Jesus.
757360	759160	When I saw this, I told myself,
759160	761260	the next time something like this happens,
761260	763060	it won't be an accident.
763060	764060	Nike.
764060	765060	For those of you who aren't aware,
765060	766160	it's pronounced Nike.
766160	767660	That's all right. I'm getting all high and mighty
767660	769460	about how to pronounce the one I know how to pronounce.
769460	770960	Just leave me alone.
770960	772360	In September of last year,
772360	774160	Nike pulled the trigger on a new commercial
774160	776960	celebrating 30 years of their Just Do It slogan.
776960	779060	The ad featured many great and famous athletes,
779060	781860	but also featured and was narrated by Colin Kaepernick.
781860	783160	Colin was 30 at the time,
783160	784860	which made him the same age as the slogan,
784860	785660	which was neat.
785660	787860	I guess he's always been the same age as the slogan.
787860	789560	How does time work?
789560	791460	This is a kind of cool commercial.
791460	792660	It's encouraging.
792660	793860	It prominently features
793860	796260	and celebrates black athletes for their success,
796260	798860	and it tacitly endorses Kaepernick's activism,
798860	800860	which goes a little beyond kneeling, by the way.
800860	802760	He's done a lot of work and given a lot of support
802760	804960	to organizations that do some really great stuff.
804960	807760	This is 100% the most tasteful
807760	810260	and inspiring shoe commercial
810260	811660	I've ever seen in my life.
811660	813660	But the commercial's content or quality
813660	815860	wasn't really the point.
815860	818060	The point was what happened next,
818060	820360	and we all knew what was gonna happen next.
825160	827660	Everyone who you can expect to be mad
827660	830060	about people protesting police brutality
830060	832860	got mad, and in a show of impotent rage
832860	834460	at a shoe company
834460	837060	for making bad commercial Mino-like,
837060	839060	destroyed some of their personal property
839060	840360	and started the hashtag
840360	841360	burnyournikes
841360	843460	and tried to start a boycott.
843460	846960	Our sound man just cut the Nike swoosh off his socks.
846960	848260	Former Marine.
848260	849460	Get ready, Nike.
849460	851660	Multiply that by the millions.
851660	853860	Looks like he's never used scissors before.
853860	855560	Nah, he was just so wound up,
855560	857060	he didn't take time.
857060	859360	It's a wonder he didn't cut himself.
859360	861960	You think we'll roll over on shit like this?
861960	865760	My troop friend was so mad at his socks,
865760	867060	he couldn't even—
867060	870460	Not only am I burning my favorite pair of Nikes,
870460	872560	you are burning your sales.
872560	873960	You think that's gonna happen?
873960	875960	Over here, in reality,
875960	879060	these bizarre, property-immolating protests
879060	881460	against Nike for daring to feature a man
881460	883660	who said police brutality was bad
883660	885560	made everyone want to talk about Nike
885560	886760	and how cool they were being
886760	888260	and make fun of these people
888260	889760	for days on end.
889760	891560	Nike was being given
891560	894260	hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising
894260	896960	by people trying to punish them.
896960	898460	Nike's value went up by—
898460	900660	Are you ready for this?
900660	904960	Six billion dollars.
904960	906760	By jolly, governor,
906760	910760	that's a lot of shoes.
910760	911560	Why did I do that?
911560	912560	And they couldn't have done it
912560	914960	without dozens of sad little boys
914960	916460	telling you just how much
916560	920060	birdbrained little shitheads like them hate Nike.
920060	921960	Congratulations, kid.
921960	923460	Throwing this in the fire
923460	924660	because of Colin Kaepernick
924660	926960	is now the face of Nike.
926960	928560	Take this, Nike.
928560	931060	Take this, Nike.
931060	934560	He thinks he's hurting Nike by doing this.
934560	936360	Six billion dollars.
936360	938960	Six billion dollars.
938960	940060	Five pairs of shoes in there,
940060	940560	all gonna let them—
940560	942060	Five pairs of shoes!
942060	944860	He bought one of those, like, three days ago, right?
944860	946160	You can still wear them.
946160	948160	You can just not buy more!
948160	951260	He can't even shut the fucking thing properly!
951260	954660	And the National Anthem's fucking blaring!
954660	956960	Ah-ha-ha-ha!
956960	957760	Fuck!
957760	959060	It's so good!
959060	961860	I forgot how good it is!
961860	962960	Ah-ha-ha!
962960	964560	So if these angry losers,
964560	966760	almost accidentally stabbing themselves
966760	968560	or giving themselves third-degree burns
968560	971160	in protest against their functioning property,
971160	974860	were trying to disincentivize support for progressive ideas,
974860	977460	they accidentally did the opposite.
977460	981660	Instead, they guaranteed it would happen again.
981660	983660	Oops!
983660	985460	Which brings us to Gillette.
985460	987360	Although, given my luck, it's pronounced
987360	988160	Gillette-y.
988160	989360	On the 13th of January,
989360	991260	Gillette released a commercial entitled
991260	993660	We Believe the Best Men Can Be.
993660	995060	Sorry, not a commercial.
995060	996460	A short film.
996460	998260	It's about how sexism is bad
998260	1000360	and you shouldn't follow women around in the street
1000360	1001860	when they're minding their own business
1001860	1003760	and don't let your kid hit other kids.
1003760	1005960	You know, like, basic stuff.
1005960	1008460	It's a piece that encourages men to improve themselves
1008460	1010460	in the really hard way,
1010460	1012860	where you question your ingrained behaviors
1012860	1014960	and think about how to encourage better ones.
1014960	1017160	It's not the sort of self-improvement advice
1017160	1018860	men tend to get, frankly.
1018860	1021560	It's quite hard to pass this sort of thing at first
1021560	1023460	when you've spent your life being told the solution
1023460	1024860	is to clean your room,
1024860	1025760	go to the gym,
1025760	1027760	and convince yourself that being shitty to people
1027760	1029460	is actually charisma and proves you have
1029460	1031060	more of a personality than them.
1031060	1032660	The response was...
1032660	1034360	predictable.
1034360	1037560	It's almost as if they intended for it
1037560	1039360	and that was the point
1039360	1040760	and they wanted it to happen.
1040760	1043260	Stable, clever boys and a few girls
1043260	1045060	from all over the internet emerged
1045060	1046960	to provide an example of their version
1046960	1048260	of masculinity in action
1048260	1049860	by screaming and crying
1049860	1052660	that a commercial said sexism was bad.
1052660	1055460	The commercial itself, anything it said or did,
1055460	1056760	didn't really matter.
1056760	1058560	A commercial gets shown a couple of times
1058560	1059760	and then it goes away.
1059760	1062160	What really mattered was this behavior.
1062160	1064360	It made Gillette the talk of the internet
1064360	1065960	for several full days
1065960	1067960	as all of the rights, thought, leaders,
1067960	1070760	bit of a misnomer, they don't seem to have had any yet,
1070760	1072960	all emerged to have their own personal
1072960	1075360	two-minute hate tweetstorm at Gillette,
1075360	1079060	not realizing that they were the actual commercial
1079060	1080160	for Gillette.
1080160	1081960	The Gillette commercial is the product
1081960	1084260	of mainstream radicalized feminism
1084260	1085460	and emblematic of
1085460	1087360	CULTURAL MARXISM.
1087360	1088660	It's actually pronounced
1089660	1092960	Stop perverting masculinity.
1092960	1095860	Let little boys wrestle.
1095860	1097960	I'm sorry, Candace. It's too late.
1097960	1099960	The Marxists are going door to door
1099960	1102160	and preventing boys from wrestling.
1102160	1103960	Now, I could just laugh at these rubbish tweets
1103960	1105060	for another 20 minutes,
1105060	1106760	but instead we're gonna cut right
1106760	1108660	to the funniest one of them all.
1108660	1110660	An account named War Room tweeted,
1110660	1113060	Goodbye Gillette. Hello Schick.
1113060	1115360	Oh, sweet. Another gentleman ready to
1115360	1117360	free his skin.
1117360	1119360	This tweet was connected to a picture he'd taken
1119360	1121560	of his Gillette razor floating in a toilet.
1121560	1123060	It was shared pretty widely,
1123060	1125860	so apparently this counts as a form of protest now,
1125860	1127560	but I can't help but imagine
1127560	1129060	the few seconds that happened
1129060	1130760	after this picture was taken.
1130760	1132560	Heh, heh, heh, heh.
1132560	1134360	This'll show him. Heh, heh.
1134360	1135760	Oh.
1135760	1138960	I have to get the razor out of the toilet now.
1138960	1141160	I have to reach into the toilet with my hands
1141160	1143160	and take it out.
1143160	1145160	I should have thought a bit harder about this,
1145160	1145960	shouldn't I?
1145960	1147860	I can't stop marveling at the majesty of it.
1147860	1148960	Speaking briefly,
1148960	1151160	as a man whose body is in, like,
1151160	1154660	the top 90 percentiles of testosterone,
1154660	1155560	I've checked.
1155560	1157560	That's why I'm gonna be bald by I'm 28.
1157560	1159860	Look forward to that, future subscribers.
1159860	1160960	I really don't get it.
1160960	1162160	I don't make a habit of questioning
1162160	1163460	other people's masculinity
1163460	1166260	because I think the concept is
1166260	1168560	super murky and basically made up
1168560	1170860	and nothing's to be gained from that,
1170860	1173260	but I do think there is a statement here
1173260	1177160	about the status of modern Western men
1177160	1178960	in the fact that millions of them
1178960	1181360	seemingly dropped fucking everything
1181360	1184160	to be mad at a commercial.
1184160	1184860	Like, what the fuck?
1184860	1187160	Aren't we supposed to be hunting the mammoth?
1187160	1188860	Like, screaming at Gillette
1188860	1190460	doesn't feed the tribe,
1190460	1192360	you fucking low-T baiter.
1192360	1193560	I can say that, by the way,
1193560	1195560	because I have more and I'm going bald.
1195560	1198760	I have to wear it so I get to make the joke.
1198760	1200560	Fuck you!
1200660	1202660	Anyway, Gillette, Keurig, and Nike
1202660	1204660	all successfully boosted their products
1204660	1206860	and their image by way of relying on
1206860	1209060	backlash from weirdos, and it worked.
1209060	1210960	They probably all made quite a lot of sales,
1210960	1212360	which reminds me.
1212360	1214860	My box of stuff from all of my favorite
1214860	1217360	progressive-sounding companies arrived.
1217360	1219360	Ooh, I wonder what's in it.
1224160	1225660	What's this?
1225660	1226460	That's weird.
1226460	1227960	I'm not sure what this is.
1227960	1229160	What could it possibly be?
1229160	1231060	Oh, it's child labor.
1231060	1233260	♪♪
1233260	1235160	Aw, yeah, here it comes, baby.
1235160	1238460	The generic 10-minute rant about how capitalism is bad
1238460	1240460	that I do at the end of every video now.
1240460	1242260	That's right, I made yet another video
1242260	1245660	to turn out to secretly be all about capitalism.
1245660	1248560	You thought I couldn't do it, but I did.
1248560	1250160	Don't ever question me again!
1250160	1251660	You don't need me to lecture you
1251660	1254160	through Nike's history of sweatshop labor
1254160	1256660	or their ongoing allegations of poor work conditions
1256660	1258460	often pulling production from factories
1258460	1259760	that threaten to unionize
1259760	1261860	and refusing to let the Workers' Rights Consortium
1261860	1263160	inspect their factories.
1263160	1265460	You don't need me to go into exacting detail
1265460	1267560	about Gillette's owners, Procter & Gamble,
1267560	1269660	a giant corporation who are implicated
1269660	1270760	in all kinds of stuff,
1270760	1272460	or the general way big businesses
1272460	1274260	are unethical on so many levels.
1274260	1276460	I'm not even gonna get into the pink tax,
1276460	1277960	the way companies like Gillette
1277960	1280060	can often say vaguely progressive things
1280060	1281960	but will happily charge women more
1281960	1283660	for effectively the same product
1283660	1285360	if they think they can get away with it.
1285360	1288360	And don't even get me started on Keurig.
1288360	1292160	Their coffee isn't very nice.
1292160	1294260	And also a bunch of labor violations.
1294260	1296260	You know most of this stuff happens already,
1296260	1297860	and we all know it's bad.
1297860	1299960	I'm not saying you should personally feel bad
1299960	1302160	for buying the products of these companies either.
1302160	1303960	Almost every company has something
1303960	1305460	in their production chain which,
1305460	1306560	if you sat and looked at it,
1306560	1308060	you'd probably find unethical.
1308060	1309260	That's the world we live in,
1309260	1310960	and we don't change it by feeling bad
1310960	1312660	about our tacit participation.
1312660	1314760	We change it by trying to find ways
1314760	1316360	of altering the way things are.
1316360	1318360	The point here is that businesses exist
1318360	1319360	to make money.
1319360	1321260	Sometimes that's in the form of moving jobs
1321260	1322860	to a country that does it cheaper,
1322860	1324660	often because they don't have to treat
1324660	1325760	their workers as well.
1325760	1327260	Sometimes it's in the form of fiddling
1327260	1329360	their taxes so much that not only did they
1329360	1330760	pay less taxes than you,
1330760	1332360	you technically paid them.
1332360	1334160	Sometimes it's in the form of charging women
1334160	1335360	more for pink razors,
1335360	1337460	and sometimes it's in finding new ways
1337460	1339760	to make you think about buying their product.
1339760	1341960	These clips sound nice.
1341960	1343560	Inspirational, even.
1343560	1346260	They say things that not only do I agree with,
1346260	1347760	but which I think are normal
1347760	1350360	and not in the slightest bit radical.
1350360	1352360	But they're commercials.
1352360	1354860	Their purpose is to sell you things.
1354860	1356360	They're a marketing strategy
1356360	1358960	with little to no impact on the actual problems
1358960	1360260	that threaten our world.
1360260	1361760	I mean, heck, they won't even admit
1361760	1364060	their commercials are commercials anymore.
1364060	1365860	They're short films.
1365860	1367860	It's got a cinematic aspect ratio,
1367860	1370160	so you know it's classy and not an ad.
1370160	1371360	There's this sequence where they play
1371360	1373060	an old Gillette ad and symbolically
1373060	1375360	break through it as if to surpass it,
1375360	1377660	but this is all window dressing designed to disguise
1377660	1380060	that you are being sold something.
1380060	1382660	It's really insidious to me how completely
1382660	1384560	companies are trying to mask the fact
1384560	1385960	that that's what they're doing.
1385960	1388460	They're still just trying to find a way to get you,
1388460	1390860	and it turns out that people don't go
1390860	1392560	for hiring a model to pretend to eat
1392560	1394360	a sandy pineapple burger anymore.
1394360	1395760	They go for something that sounds
1395760	1397660	really progressive and forward-thinking
1397660	1399160	and that all the weirdos on Twitter
1399160	1400460	seem to be mad about.
1400460	1403260	It's just like dear old dad always used to tell me.
1403260	1407060	Son, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
1408260	1409260	Actually, that's a lie.
1409260	1410860	That's my fantasy.
1410860	1412360	Dad mostly just sat in the corner
1412360	1413860	and read Victor Klemperer books.
1413860	1416760	But I'm the Victor Klemperer of my age, father!
1416760	1419360	I tell everyone which video games are bad!
1419360	1421260	Brands are not our friends,
1421260	1423060	but it is nice, isn't it?
1423060	1425060	I mean, I can make fun of people for buying razors
1425060	1426660	just to spite some weirdos online
1426660	1428760	or for liking a commercial or whatever,
1428760	1431760	but it is pretty cool that a company
1431760	1434260	actually invited discussion of these issues.
1434260	1436660	Just keep in mind that there are deeper problems
1436660	1439760	with these companies that we do need to talk about and solve,
1439760	1441460	and don't let them buy your allegiance
1441460	1443460	by saying something vaguely progressive-sounding
1443460	1444460	in a commercial.
1444460	1446860	Besides, there are better, less invasive,
1446860	1448760	more genuine ways of getting your product
1448760	1450560	out there to people.
1450560	1452660	Which brings me to CuriosityStream.
1452660	1455060	CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming service
1455060	1457060	that offers over 2,000 documentaries
1457060	1458860	and non-fiction titles from some of the world's
1458860	1461360	best filmmakers, including exclusive originals
1461360	1462960	made specifically for the platform.
1462960	1464460	It's created by John Hendricks,
1464460	1466160	the guy who founded the Discovery Channel,
1466160	1467660	and I really enjoyed a series on there
1467660	1468860	called History of Food,
1468860	1470460	which tracks the invention of cooking
1470460	1471460	millions of years ago,
1471460	1473660	the development of processes like fermentation
1473660	1475860	and bread-making and how this allowed civilization
1475860	1478260	to prosper, all the way to the modern food industry
1478260	1479960	and its more modern problems.
1479960	1482460	I am currently in the process of making a couple of videos
1482460	1485260	about diet science and junk diets and stuff like that,
1485260	1486560	so if you watch this series,
1486560	1488660	you'll know exactly where I stole everything from.
1488660	1490260	Access to everything on the platform
1490260	1494260	costs $2.99 a month or $19.99 a year,
1494260	1496560	but if you go to curiositystream.com
1496560	1497860	slash hbomberguy,
1497860	1500560	your membership will be free for the first 30 days.
1500560	1502060	Hey, thanks for watching the commercial
1502060	1503360	all the way through, too.
1503360	1505060	I think now would be a good time to bring up
1505060	1506460	that this stuff can all happen
1506460	1508560	in the opposite direction, too.
1508560	1510860	Watch out for right-wing commercials
1510860	1512560	that promote traditional values
1512560	1515460	or are weirdly loving of Donald Trump.
1515460	1517960	Uh, I mean, there's already, like, a watch commercial
1517960	1521060	that's, like, a response to the Gillette thing
1521060	1523260	where they're like, men have it way hard in there.
1523260	1525760	The next time a commercial like that comes out,
1525760	1528760	which it will because this stuff goes in any direction,
1528760	1531860	marketing companies know what they're doing,
1531860	1533460	just don't worry about it.
1533460	1536360	You know, like, there are so many important problems
1536360	1538560	in the world right now that are worth talking about
1538560	1540460	and worth solving,
1540460	1543460	and in the scheme of that,
1543460	1545660	commercials that say something you don't like
1545660	1548660	are effectively a trick to waste your time,
1548660	1550760	and your time is better spent than that
1550760	1552360	because I love you,
1552360	1555060	and there are people in your life right now,
1555060	1557960	even you, who could benefit from that time,
1557960	1560260	so spend it on them instead.
1560260	1561960	You have my permission now.
1561960	1564260	Heh. I guess.
1564260	1567260	Um, and I hope you have a really great night.
1567260	1568660	Do something you enjoy.
1568660	1570660	I've been really into hummus lately.
1570660	1573360	Check that out, and look up cool time management skills
1573360	1575060	if you haven't. It turns out it's a really great thing.
1575060	1577460	I got this video out, like, two weeks early.
1577460	1579760	Um, yeah, take care of yourselves,
1579760	1580760	and, uh, have a good night,
1580760	1582760	and brands are not your friends.
1582760	1586360	Um, thanks, CuriosityStream, for the sponsorship.
1586360	1589960	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1589960	1590960	I'm screwed.
1590960	1596560	Uh, love yourself, and take care.
1596560	1597560	Bye.
1601560	1602760	Oh, I also have a Patreon.
1602760	1604760	Oh, I forgot to...
