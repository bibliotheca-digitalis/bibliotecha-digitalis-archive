This video is sponsored by Curiosity.

00:02.060 --> 00:03.100
Zzzzzz-

00:03.100 --> 00:04.260
Nnggh!

00:04.260 --> 00:06.840
Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!

00:06.840 --> 00:09.800
Good evening, fellow brain-mind-explordinares!

00:09.800 --> 00:11.360
Harris Bomberguy here!

00:11.360 --> 00:13.300
Uh! Ugh!

00:13.300 --> 00:14.760
Mm!

00:14.760 --> 00:16.760
If there's one thing everyone knows about me,

00:16.760 --> 00:19.360
it's that I love how corporations and branding

00:19.360 --> 00:21.060
utterly dominate our culture.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.340
The golden arches, the Nike tick,

00:23.340 --> 00:26.440
the...whatever distinctive thing Burger King has.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.300
These familiar designs help remind me I'm alive,

00:29.500 --> 00:31.900
and the dopamine that pours from their food pipe

00:31.900 --> 00:35.000
is like the warm embrace of an attractive friend,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.300
with maybe some benefits if they pity you enough.

00:37.300 --> 00:40.400
And golly, isn't it great when companies extol ideas

00:40.400 --> 00:42.360
that accord with my own values?

00:42.360 --> 00:45.060
It's like helping to spread a positive message

00:45.060 --> 00:46.800
and make the world a better place.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.200
And to show my support,

00:48.200 --> 00:50.600
I bought a bunch of their stuff online.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.160
I mean, you've got to support the heroes

00:52.160 --> 00:54.000
fighting for the right cause.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.500
After all, in what other way can we actually voice support

00:57.500 --> 00:59.360
for making the world better in a society

00:59.360 --> 01:01.600
where corporations have far more power

01:01.600 --> 01:04.000
over our world than any of the people

01:04.000 --> 01:07.200
who actually have to live in it?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.960
Oh, that's depressing.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.700
That's not going to be the point of the video, is it?

01:10.700 --> 01:13.500
♪♪

01:13.500 --> 01:15.200
The history of advertising,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.700
according to what I remember from high school media studies.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.160
Advertising has taken place for most of human history,

01:20.160 --> 01:21.860
but with the invention of the printing press

01:21.860 --> 01:23.500
and popularization of the newspaper,

01:23.500 --> 01:24.560
it really took off.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.260
Even as early as the 1800s,

01:26.260 --> 01:27.860
you couldn't read your paper for updates

01:27.860 --> 01:29.460
about the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War

01:29.460 --> 01:31.860
without some little fucker telling you about his bovril.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.360
Invaluable to invalids and weak persons.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.360
You can't say that.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.660
Some people think of advertisements

01:36.660 --> 01:37.660
as value-neutral.

01:37.660 --> 01:38.960
It's just a piece of paper

01:38.960 --> 01:41.360
or some video footage conveniently letting you know

01:41.360 --> 01:44.160
about a thing that exists and what it does

01:44.160 --> 01:46.060
so you can make an informed decision

01:46.060 --> 01:47.860
about your potential purchase.

01:47.860 --> 01:50.660
Sam, I don't have to cut myself to shave clothes.

01:50.660 --> 01:53.260
This is the track two, the two-bladed razor from Gillette.

01:53.260 --> 01:55.260
The blades are recessed so it's safer.

01:55.260 --> 01:56.360
Because as we know,

01:56.360 --> 01:58.760
humans are perfectly rational actors.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.560
After all, capitalism works

02:00.560 --> 02:02.760
because it's just in everyone's rational self-interest

02:02.760 --> 02:04.860
to make a really good product.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.160
No, wait, hang on. I forgot about human psychology.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.760
You can just trick people into buying things.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.260
Oops.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.760
♪♪

02:11.760 --> 02:14.160
It turns out that it's possible to convince people

02:14.160 --> 02:16.160
to do things they wouldn't do otherwise

02:16.160 --> 02:17.360
and probably shouldn't.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.360
Advertising is really a large collection

02:19.360 --> 02:21.560
of people trying to find the most effective way

02:21.560 --> 02:24.160
of getting you to give your money to their bosses

02:24.160 --> 02:25.260
to buy their thing.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.860
It's a massive and very lucrative industry.

02:27.860 --> 02:30.860
To put it the way this old cigarette commercial did,

02:30.860 --> 02:32.160
we're gonna get ya.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.260
One of the most effective ways to sell a product

02:34.260 --> 02:37.660
is to tie it to someone's sense of value or their goals.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.860
Owning this product will prove you're a successful person.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.760
This product will make you irresistible

02:42.760 --> 02:43.960
to women we made up.

02:43.960 --> 02:44.860
Ooh!

02:44.860 --> 02:45.660
Oh!

02:45.660 --> 02:47.860
Maybe if you ate at a fast food restaurant more,

02:47.860 --> 02:50.060
your children would love you, you piece of shit!

02:50.060 --> 02:52.460
But the problem is this doesn't work forever.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.660
Advertising has become more and more ubiquitous

02:54.660 --> 02:56.760
and audiences stop paying attention to commercials

02:56.760 --> 02:58.160
when they're a lot like ones they've seen

02:58.160 --> 02:59.560
thousands of times before.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.860
You have to push these ideas harder and harder

03:01.860 --> 03:02.760
for them to work.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.460
Over time, commercials became more and more brazen

03:05.460 --> 03:08.060
in associating their products with power and sex

03:08.060 --> 03:09.560
until it became so weird

03:09.560 --> 03:11.860
it's almost indistinguishable from a joke.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.560
Take this classic Big Mac poster

03:13.560 --> 03:15.860
where the burger's on a red velvet bed

03:15.860 --> 03:16.360
and it says,

03:16.360 --> 03:18.860
stop staring at me like I'm some piece of meat.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.360
Are you Mac enough?

03:20.360 --> 03:21.560
Like, man enough?

03:21.560 --> 03:25.160
Like, are you enough of a masculine manly man-man

03:25.160 --> 03:27.860
to get into bed with this burger

03:27.860 --> 03:31.660
and just go to town with your mouth?

03:31.660 --> 03:33.560
But you are a piece of meat.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.160
I—

03:35.360 --> 03:37.260
Oh, I'm supposed to fuck this burger.

03:37.260 --> 03:37.860
Duh-duh!

03:37.860 --> 03:38.860
Duh-duh-duh!

03:38.860 --> 03:41.760
By this point, advertisers had drilled so far down

03:41.760 --> 03:43.060
into the human id,

03:43.060 --> 03:44.460
they'd gone too far,

03:44.460 --> 03:47.560
broken through all pre-existing Freudian evo-psych theories

03:47.560 --> 03:50.960
and entered directly into the darkness of the human mind more,

03:50.960 --> 03:52.860
to the place where you're paying a supermodel

03:52.860 --> 03:55.560
to pretend to eat a burger in her bikini at the beach

03:55.560 --> 03:59.060
because maybe horny viewers will want to do a sex so badly

03:59.060 --> 04:02.260
they'll get hungry for a teriyaki burger.

04:02.260 --> 04:05.360
God, that burger is definitely covered in sand at this point.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.460
It would probably improve the flavor, though.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.460
I love that the camera keeps cutting away

04:09.460 --> 04:11.660
before any of it ever goes in her mouth

04:11.660 --> 04:13.160
because it's basically poison.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.260
No, don't eat the pineapple! It's evil! Don't!

04:15.260 --> 04:18.460
So it was clear to advertisers that a new strategy was required.

04:18.460 --> 04:19.660
Sex might sell,

04:19.660 --> 04:22.860
but it doesn't stand out amongst a crowd of sex.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.960
If you want people to pay attention,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.860
you have to do something truly different.

04:27.860 --> 04:30.260
["Cool Law"]

04:30.260 --> 04:31.060
["Cool Law"]

04:31.060 --> 04:33.760
Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...

04:33.760 --> 04:34.460
Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch...

04:34.460 --> 04:36.460
This UK commercial for Apple Earphones

04:36.460 --> 04:37.760
is incredibly memorable,

04:37.760 --> 04:39.060
even a decade later.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.660
It's probably in the top three most well-known pieces

04:41.660 --> 04:44.160
of video footage ever to grace our little aisles,

04:44.160 --> 04:46.160
just behind the old Smash commercials

04:46.160 --> 04:48.160
and the bit where Del Boy falls through the bar.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.660
It's so weird and devoid of anything you'd expect from an ad

04:51.660 --> 04:54.260
that it grabs your attention in a completely new way.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.160
It's so memorable, except, of course,

04:56.160 --> 04:58.160
for the part where it wasn't a commercial for earphones.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.160
I made that up. It was for Cadbury's chocolate,

05:00.160 --> 05:01.560
you gormless rube!

05:01.560 --> 05:04.060
The last decade of marketing school graduates

05:04.060 --> 05:06.160
are people who saw commercials like this

05:06.160 --> 05:08.360
and the power and memorability they had

05:08.360 --> 05:10.660
and went, yeah, I can do that exactly like that.

05:10.660 --> 05:12.460
I'm gonna be weird, too.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.760
But the problem with everyone trying to be weird

05:14.760 --> 05:17.460
and different and stand out all at the same time

05:17.460 --> 05:20.560
is they kind of all stopped standing out,

05:20.560 --> 05:21.960
like, immediately.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.560
So tons of commercials nowadays are just super out there

05:24.560 --> 05:26.760
and bizarre and have nothing to do with the product,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.660
but you still don't really notice or care

05:28.660 --> 05:30.260
because you're already attuned to it.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.060
Nowadays, the only ads that stand out

05:32.060 --> 05:34.360
are, like, the ones that are just so bad

05:34.360 --> 05:36.360
that you remember them to make fun of them.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.660
Let's do that now!

05:37.660 --> 05:39.560
Remember the shit Hydrobot?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.660
Hydrobot at it again!

05:41.660 --> 05:43.960
Who you remember specifically because

05:43.960 --> 05:46.160
it's a really awkward and terrible way

05:46.260 --> 05:48.360
of promoting...anything?

05:48.360 --> 05:49.960
I don't think they sold many products

05:49.960 --> 05:51.260
off the back of this thing.

05:51.260 --> 05:54.060
People just remember it because...

05:54.060 --> 05:55.860
Transformers razor.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.260
You're gonna shave yourself with a razor

05:57.260 --> 05:58.760
that's gonna fucking turn into a car

05:58.760 --> 06:00.860
and cut your fucking face off?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.560
Free your skin!

06:02.560 --> 06:05.860
I do not want to free my skin!

06:05.860 --> 06:06.960
What? What?

06:06.960 --> 06:08.560
But worse than that,

06:08.560 --> 06:10.160
this goes a layer deeper.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.660
Remember the shit Hydrosilk robot?

06:12.660 --> 06:14.260
You probably didn't because you've had

06:14.260 --> 06:16.360
a trillion other deeply stupid things

06:16.360 --> 06:18.560
flashed directly into your cortex.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.460
But I remember it all.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.860
I remember it, so you don't have to...

06:25.360 --> 06:26.860
KILL ME!

06:26.860 --> 06:28.260
Shick Hydrosilk.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.660
Free your skin! Free your skin!

06:30.660 --> 06:32.760
This commercial is currently unlisted

06:32.760 --> 06:34.860
from Shick Hydrosilk's channel.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.860
I can't imagine why.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.360
With the creation of this, uh...

06:39.360 --> 06:41.260
Titty Robot Adventure commercial,

06:41.260 --> 06:43.260
it's clear that all pre-existing methods

06:43.260 --> 06:45.360
of advertising are failing to work that well.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.560
Plus, in a way, for the first time in a while,

06:47.560 --> 06:50.160
there are less venues to advertise to people now

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
than there used to be.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.760
A lot of people don't really watch television anymore

06:53.760 --> 06:55.760
and consume content on their computers

06:55.760 --> 06:58.360
with ad blockers enabled, the cowards!

06:58.360 --> 06:59.560
If you use an ad blocker,

06:59.560 --> 07:01.560
you're basically snatching the soy

07:01.560 --> 07:03.360
from my savoring mouth!

07:03.360 --> 07:04.560
Whenever a successful method

07:04.560 --> 07:06.160
of getting your brand attention is found,

07:06.160 --> 07:07.760
it's swiftly copied and repeated,

07:07.760 --> 07:09.060
quickly rendering it useless.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.460
The fastest cycle I've seen

07:10.460 --> 07:12.560
is with the trend of weird brand Twitter,

07:12.560 --> 07:14.160
like Wendy's having a go at people,

07:14.160 --> 07:16.560
or Arby's making funny cardboard things,

07:16.560 --> 07:18.660
or Sunny Delight's recent depression tweet.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.860
These are meant to make the brand seem personal

07:20.860 --> 07:23.060
and ironic and not like a corporation

07:23.060 --> 07:24.860
who wants your attention and money,

07:24.860 --> 07:27.460
but to a trained eye, they do the opposite.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.860
A sizable company's not letting their media managers

07:29.860 --> 07:31.260
run their accounts in this manner

07:31.260 --> 07:33.260
unless they've done painstaking market research

07:33.260 --> 07:35.060
and found it to be beneficial to do.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.960
And what's more, since it's literally free to do this,

07:37.960 --> 07:40.660
every even vaguely savvy brand's getting in on it,

07:40.660 --> 07:42.860
which has swiftly made it a saturated format

07:42.860 --> 07:44.860
that bores people and makes it lose the sense

07:44.860 --> 07:46.260
that this is in any way unique.

07:46.260 --> 07:49.560
I mean, if fucking Corn Nuts are getting in on it now,

07:49.560 --> 07:51.560
it's not gonna work anymore.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.860
Corn Nuts, the world's most underrated snack.

07:54.860 --> 07:57.160
That's one way to channel the fact people don't like you.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.760
Soon, it'll be so ubiquitous

07:58.760 --> 08:00.160
that people just tune it out,

08:00.160 --> 08:01.860
like all regular advertisements,

08:01.860 --> 08:04.460
which means marketing companies are looking for a new way

08:04.460 --> 08:06.760
to push their products into your consciousness,

08:06.760 --> 08:09.760
and they've found it in a very strange place.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.560
And it technically happened by accident.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.160
Pfft.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.660
Keurig.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.560
Is it Keurig or is it Keurig?

08:15.560 --> 08:16.660
Keurig?

08:16.660 --> 08:18.260
Ugh, it's just—it's fine.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.960
Look, I already recorded this bit,

08:19.960 --> 08:22.260
so if I pronounce it wrong, whatever.

08:22.260 --> 08:25.260
In late 2017, when American talk show host Sean Hannity

08:25.260 --> 08:26.760
came to the defense of Roy Moore...

08:26.760 --> 08:28.460
Everyone would agree. Everybody.

08:28.460 --> 08:31.960
A 32-year-old man pursuing a 14-year-old girl is disgusting.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.860
That is something we should all agree on.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.660
This should transcend politics.

08:35.660 --> 08:36.260
However...

08:36.260 --> 08:38.360
...Media Matters president Angelo Caruso—

08:38.460 --> 08:40.260
Wait, what if it's pronounced Carusoni?

08:40.260 --> 08:41.460
Oh, I should have checked.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.960
—among others asked coffee machine company Keurig

08:43.960 --> 08:46.160
to reconsider sponsoring Hannity's show,

08:46.160 --> 08:47.860
and Keurig responded by tweeting

08:47.860 --> 08:49.360
that they were pulling their advertising.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.560
At least four other companies pulled advertising

08:51.560 --> 08:53.460
from Hannity's show for supporting Moore,

08:53.460 --> 08:55.860
but Keurig visibly tweeting about doing it

08:55.860 --> 08:58.260
and it getting a very large and vocal response

08:58.260 --> 09:00.060
and support for having done it

09:00.060 --> 09:02.560
caused a lot of sudden reactions.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.960
In one corner of the Internet,

09:03.960 --> 09:05.460
people were suddenly thinking about

09:05.460 --> 09:07.160
buying a Keurig coffee machine.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.460
I mean, they made a stand.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
Uh, in a very minor way.

09:11.460 --> 09:14.160
In another corner, marketing people, ad people,

09:14.160 --> 09:17.360
people whose job is to see what causes this kind of splash

09:17.360 --> 09:20.460
started watching closely and taking notes.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.060
And in the saddest corner,

09:22.060 --> 09:24.260
Hannity fans went berserk.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.960
Oh!

09:25.960 --> 09:27.660
Hope you're happy, Keurig.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.160
Oh, yeah, that'll show them.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.160
This video, published on the 12th of November,

09:31.160 --> 09:32.760
one day after Keurig's tweet,

09:32.760 --> 09:35.460
of self-appointed red pill aficionado

09:35.460 --> 09:38.760
Angelo John Gage destroying his Keurig coffee machine

09:38.760 --> 09:42.160
and making a huge mess of his garage in his pajamas.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.260
Ah, but don't worry, he's wearing socks with his flip-flops,

09:44.260 --> 09:45.260
so he's protected.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.260
Has a shit ton of likes and retweets

09:47.260 --> 09:49.560
and sparked hashtag Boycott Keurig,

09:49.560 --> 09:51.460
a sort of pseudo-protest movement

09:51.460 --> 09:53.960
where right-wing people, shocked and upset

09:53.960 --> 09:57.060
that a company wouldn't give money to someone they watch

09:57.060 --> 09:59.460
to sell them something they already own,

09:59.460 --> 10:02.460
destroy their expensive, functioning coffee machines

10:02.460 --> 10:04.560
they bought to spite the company

10:04.560 --> 10:07.260
for this horrendous slight?

10:07.260 --> 10:09.560
Uh, this, internally for Keurig,

10:09.560 --> 10:11.560
was initially thought of as a terrible accident.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.960
All these angry people harassing Keurig employees

10:13.960 --> 10:16.560
and even the brief, though ultimately insignificant,

10:16.560 --> 10:19.560
stink of a boycott, but secretly,

10:19.560 --> 10:21.760
everyone was looking at how much attention

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760
Keurig was getting.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.060
You know what shows up a lot when there's a big hashtag

10:25.060 --> 10:29.360
about boycotting Keurig going around for days?

10:29.360 --> 10:30.660
The word Keurig.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.360
The story about what Keurig did

10:32.360 --> 10:34.560
and how people feel about it.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.860
And it turns out that this is very similar to marketing.

10:37.860 --> 10:39.560
Some people want to support Keurig

10:39.560 --> 10:40.760
for the nice thing they did.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.960
I mean, they took a stand by pulling some ads

10:43.960 --> 10:45.760
from one TV show for a while.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.960
And then there's the people who suddenly realized

10:47.960 --> 10:49.760
that they could do with a coffee machine

10:49.760 --> 10:51.560
since everyone's talking about them lately.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.860
And then there's the flip side of almost every boycott,

10:53.860 --> 10:56.660
which is the people who destroyed the thing that they own

10:56.660 --> 10:58.760
realizing that they quite liked it

10:58.760 --> 11:00.760
and, hey, no one's really paying attention

11:00.760 --> 11:03.060
to whether or not I obey this boycott or not,

11:03.060 --> 11:04.660
so maybe I'll just get another one.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.760
It doesn't really make a big difference.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.460
And then, of course, there's the simple fact

11:09.460 --> 11:12.660
that people don't tend to go on with boycotts for very long.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.060
It happens.

11:14.060 --> 11:16.460
I hate to break it to you, but if you ever destroyed

11:16.460 --> 11:18.660
something that you own as part of a protest

11:18.660 --> 11:20.260
against a company's actions,

11:20.260 --> 11:23.160
statistically, you bought another one.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.760
And then you bought an extra one for one of your 2.14 kids.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.060
Probably Kevin.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.760
He gets all the nice things, doesn't he?

11:29.760 --> 11:31.160
What's wrong with me, mother?

11:31.160 --> 11:32.360
Don't you love me anymore?

11:32.360 --> 11:33.560
Sure, it's hilarious.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.260
These people are deeply foolish,

11:35.260 --> 11:37.460
and it's good on some level

11:37.460 --> 11:39.960
that sometimes advertisers don't support purveyors

11:39.960 --> 11:41.560
of a garbage ideology,

11:41.560 --> 11:42.960
but on the serious side,

11:42.960 --> 11:45.860
the analysts watching and waiting in the background

11:45.860 --> 11:47.460
learned an interesting lesson.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.960
All of this is a goldmine.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.060
It's more than a commercial.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.760
It's a real-mercial.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.160
That's my word. I just coined it.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.960
Attribute it to me. Put it in the dictionary.

11:57.060 --> 12:00.260
When you're the focus of a discussion online,

12:00.260 --> 12:03.760
when you're a hashtag millions can click on and check out,

12:03.760 --> 12:07.260
when you are the conversation for a brief moment

12:07.260 --> 12:11.160
that everyone feels expected to think about and have a take,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.760
not even an ad block can hide you.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.760
Not even someone who doesn't watch TV

12:15.760 --> 12:17.160
can miss your message.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.760
The exposure was massive,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.260
and it was effectively free.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.660
And...I'm sorry.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.460
I just need to stop for a second

12:24.460 --> 12:26.860
to acknowledge how hilarious it is

12:26.860 --> 12:29.760
that the guy, like, couldn't frame it properly

12:29.760 --> 12:31.860
with his vertical phone video,

12:31.860 --> 12:35.660
so it keeps falling out of the fucking frame.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.360
Oh, Jesus.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.160
When I saw this, I told myself,

12:39.160 --> 12:41.260
the next time something like this happens,

12:41.260 --> 12:43.060
it won't be an accident.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.060
Nike.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.060
For those of you who aren't aware,

12:45.060 --> 12:46.160
it's pronounced Nike.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.660
That's all right. I'm getting all high and mighty

12:47.660 --> 12:49.460
about how to pronounce the one I know how to pronounce.

12:49.460 --> 12:50.960
Just leave me alone.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.360
In September of last year,

12:52.360 --> 12:54.160
Nike pulled the trigger on a new commercial

12:54.160 --> 12:56.960
celebrating 30 years of their Just Do It slogan.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.060
The ad featured many great and famous athletes,

12:59.060 --> 13:01.860
but also featured and was narrated by Colin Kaepernick.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.160
Colin was 30 at the time,

13:03.160 --> 13:04.860
which made him the same age as the slogan,

13:04.860 --> 13:05.660
which was neat.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.860
I guess he's always been the same age as the slogan.

13:07.860 --> 13:09.560
How does time work?

13:09.560 --> 13:11.460
This is a kind of cool commercial.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.660
It's encouraging.

13:12.660 --> 13:13.860
It prominently features

13:13.860 --> 13:16.260
and celebrates black athletes for their success,

13:16.260 --> 13:18.860
and it tacitly endorses Kaepernick's activism,

13:18.860 --> 13:20.860
which goes a little beyond kneeling, by the way.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.760
He's done a lot of work and given a lot of support

13:22.760 --> 13:24.960
to organizations that do some really great stuff.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.760
This is 100% the most tasteful

13:27.760 --> 13:30.260
and inspiring shoe commercial

13:30.260 --> 13:31.660
I've ever seen in my life.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.660
But the commercial's content or quality

13:33.660 --> 13:35.860
wasn't really the point.

13:35.860 --> 13:38.060
The point was what happened next,

13:38.060 --> 13:40.360
and we all knew what was gonna happen next.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.660
Everyone who you can expect to be mad

13:47.660 --> 13:50.060
about people protesting police brutality

13:50.060 --> 13:52.860
got mad, and in a show of impotent rage

13:52.860 --> 13:54.460
at a shoe company

13:54.460 --> 13:57.060
for making bad commercial Mino-like,

13:57.060 --> 13:59.060
destroyed some of their personal property

13:59.060 --> 14:00.360
and started the hashtag

14:00.360 --> 14:01.360
burnyournikes

14:01.360 --> 14:03.460
and tried to start a boycott.

14:03.460 --> 14:06.960
Our sound man just cut the Nike swoosh off his socks.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.260
Former Marine.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.460
Get ready, Nike.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.660
Multiply that by the millions.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.860
Looks like he's never used scissors before.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.560
Nah, he was just so wound up,

14:15.560 --> 14:17.060
he didn't take time.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.360
It's a wonder he didn't cut himself.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.960
You think we'll roll over on shit like this?

14:21.960 --> 14:25.760
My troop friend was so mad at his socks,

14:25.760 --> 14:27.060
he couldn't even—

14:27.060 --> 14:30.460
Not only am I burning my favorite pair of Nikes,

14:30.460 --> 14:32.560
you are burning your sales.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.960
You think that's gonna happen?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.960
Over here, in reality,

14:35.960 --> 14:39.060
these bizarre, property-immolating protests

14:39.060 --> 14:41.460
against Nike for daring to feature a man

14:41.460 --> 14:43.660
who said police brutality was bad

14:43.660 --> 14:45.560
made everyone want to talk about Nike

14:45.560 --> 14:46.760
and how cool they were being

14:46.760 --> 14:48.260
and make fun of these people

14:48.260 --> 14:49.760
for days on end.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.560
Nike was being given

14:51.560 --> 14:54.260
hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising

14:54.260 --> 14:56.960
by people trying to punish them.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.460
Nike's value went up by—

14:58.460 --> 15:00.660
Are you ready for this?

15:00.660 --> 15:04.960
Six billion dollars.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.760
By jolly, governor,

15:06.760 --> 15:10.760
that's a lot of shoes.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.560
Why did I do that?

15:11.560 --> 15:12.560
And they couldn't have done it

15:12.560 --> 15:14.960
without dozens of sad little boys

15:14.960 --> 15:16.460
telling you just how much

15:16.560 --> 15:20.060
birdbrained little shitheads like them hate Nike.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.960
Congratulations, kid.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.460
Throwing this in the fire

15:23.460 --> 15:24.660
because of Colin Kaepernick

15:24.660 --> 15:26.960
is now the face of Nike.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.560
Take this, Nike.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.060
Take this, Nike.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.560
He thinks he's hurting Nike by doing this.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.360
Six billion dollars.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.960
Six billion dollars.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.060
Five pairs of shoes in there,

15:40.060 --> 15:40.560
all gonna let them—

15:40.560 --> 15:42.060
Five pairs of shoes!

15:42.060 --> 15:44.860
He bought one of those, like, three days ago, right?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.160
You can still wear them.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.160
You can just not buy more!

15:48.160 --> 15:51.260
He can't even shut the fucking thing properly!

15:51.260 --> 15:54.660
And the National Anthem's fucking blaring!

15:54.660 --> 15:56.960
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

15:56.960 --> 15:57.760
Fuck!

15:57.760 --> 15:59.060
It's so good!

15:59.060 --> 16:01.860
I forgot how good it is!

16:01.860 --> 16:02.960
Ah-ha-ha!

16:02.960 --> 16:04.560
So if these angry losers,

16:04.560 --> 16:06.760
almost accidentally stabbing themselves

16:06.760 --> 16:08.560
or giving themselves third-degree burns

16:08.560 --> 16:11.160
in protest against their functioning property,

16:11.160 --> 16:14.860
were trying to disincentivize support for progressive ideas,

16:14.860 --> 16:17.460
they accidentally did the opposite.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.660
Instead, they guaranteed it would happen again.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.660
Oops!

16:23.660 --> 16:25.460
Which brings us to Gillette.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.360
Although, given my luck, it's pronounced

16:27.360 --> 16:28.160
Gillette-y.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.360
On the 13th of January,

16:29.360 --> 16:31.260
Gillette released a commercial entitled

16:31.260 --> 16:33.660
We Believe the Best Men Can Be.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.060
Sorry, not a commercial.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.460
A short film.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.260
It's about how sexism is bad

16:38.260 --> 16:40.360
and you shouldn't follow women around in the street

16:40.360 --> 16:41.860
when they're minding their own business

16:41.860 --> 16:43.760
and don't let your kid hit other kids.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.960
You know, like, basic stuff.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.460
It's a piece that encourages men to improve themselves

16:48.460 --> 16:50.460
in the really hard way,

16:50.460 --> 16:52.860
where you question your ingrained behaviors

16:52.860 --> 16:54.960
and think about how to encourage better ones.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.160
It's not the sort of self-improvement advice

16:57.160 --> 16:58.860
men tend to get, frankly.

16:58.860 --> 17:01.560
It's quite hard to pass this sort of thing at first

17:01.560 --> 17:03.460
when you've spent your life being told the solution

17:03.460 --> 17:04.860
is to clean your room,

17:04.860 --> 17:05.760
go to the gym,

17:05.760 --> 17:07.760
and convince yourself that being shitty to people

17:07.760 --> 17:09.460
is actually charisma and proves you have

17:09.460 --> 17:11.060
more of a personality than them.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.660
The response was...

17:12.660 --> 17:14.360
predictable.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.560
It's almost as if they intended for it

17:17.560 --> 17:19.360
and that was the point

17:19.360 --> 17:20.760
and they wanted it to happen.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.260
Stable, clever boys and a few girls

17:23.260 --> 17:25.060
from all over the internet emerged

17:25.060 --> 17:26.960
to provide an example of their version

17:26.960 --> 17:28.260
of masculinity in action

17:28.260 --> 17:29.860
by screaming and crying

17:29.860 --> 17:32.660
that a commercial said sexism was bad.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.460
The commercial itself, anything it said or did,

17:35.460 --> 17:36.760
didn't really matter.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.560
A commercial gets shown a couple of times

17:38.560 --> 17:39.760
and then it goes away.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.160
What really mattered was this behavior.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.360
It made Gillette the talk of the internet

17:44.360 --> 17:45.960
for several full days

17:45.960 --> 17:47.960
as all of the rights, thought, leaders,

17:47.960 --> 17:50.760
bit of a misnomer, they don't seem to have had any yet,

17:50.760 --> 17:52.960
all emerged to have their own personal

17:52.960 --> 17:55.360
two-minute hate tweetstorm at Gillette,

17:55.360 --> 17:59.060
not realizing that they were the actual commercial

17:59.060 --> 18:00.160
for Gillette.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.960
The Gillette commercial is the product

18:01.960 --> 18:04.260
of mainstream radicalized feminism

18:04.260 --> 18:05.460
and emblematic of

18:05.460 --> 18:07.360
CULTURAL MARXISM.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.660
It's actually pronounced

18:09.660 --> 18:12.960
Stop perverting masculinity.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.860
Let little boys wrestle.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.960
I'm sorry, Candace. It's too late.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.960
The Marxists are going door to door

18:19.960 --> 18:22.160
and preventing boys from wrestling.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.960
Now, I could just laugh at these rubbish tweets

18:23.960 --> 18:25.060
for another 20 minutes,

18:25.060 --> 18:26.760
but instead we're gonna cut right

18:26.760 --> 18:28.660
to the funniest one of them all.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.660
An account named War Room tweeted,

18:30.660 --> 18:33.060
Goodbye Gillette. Hello Schick.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.360
Oh, sweet. Another gentleman ready to

18:35.360 --> 18:37.360
free his skin.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.360
This tweet was connected to a picture he'd taken

18:39.360 --> 18:41.560
of his Gillette razor floating in a toilet.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.060
It was shared pretty widely,

18:43.060 --> 18:45.860
so apparently this counts as a form of protest now,

18:45.860 --> 18:47.560
but I can't help but imagine

18:47.560 --> 18:49.060
the few seconds that happened

18:49.060 --> 18:50.760
after this picture was taken.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.560
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.360
This'll show him. Heh, heh.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.760
Oh.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.960
I have to get the razor out of the toilet now.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.160
I have to reach into the toilet with my hands

19:01.160 --> 19:03.160
and take it out.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.160
I should have thought a bit harder about this,

19:05.160 --> 19:05.960
shouldn't I?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.860
I can't stop marveling at the majesty of it.

19:07.860 --> 19:08.960
Speaking briefly,

19:08.960 --> 19:11.160
as a man whose body is in, like,

19:11.160 --> 19:14.660
the top 90 percentiles of testosterone,

19:14.660 --> 19:15.560
I've checked.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.560
That's why I'm gonna be bald by I'm 28.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.860
Look forward to that, future subscribers.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.960
I really don't get it.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.160
I don't make a habit of questioning

19:22.160 --> 19:23.460
other people's masculinity

19:23.460 --> 19:26.260
because I think the concept is

19:26.260 --> 19:28.560
super murky and basically made up

19:28.560 --> 19:30.860
and nothing's to be gained from that,

19:30.860 --> 19:33.260
but I do think there is a statement here

19:33.260 --> 19:37.160
about the status of modern Western men

19:37.160 --> 19:38.960
in the fact that millions of them

19:38.960 --> 19:41.360
seemingly dropped fucking everything

19:41.360 --> 19:44.160
to be mad at a commercial.

19:44.160 --> 19:44.860
Like, what the fuck?

19:44.860 --> 19:47.160
Aren't we supposed to be hunting the mammoth?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.860
Like, screaming at Gillette

19:48.860 --> 19:50.460
doesn't feed the tribe,

19:50.460 --> 19:52.360
you fucking low-T baiter.

19:52.360 --> 19:53.560
I can say that, by the way,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.560
because I have more and I'm going bald.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.760
I have to wear it so I get to make the joke.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.560
Fuck you!

20:00.660 --> 20:02.660
Anyway, Gillette, Keurig, and Nike

20:02.660 --> 20:04.660
all successfully boosted their products

20:04.660 --> 20:06.860
and their image by way of relying on

20:06.860 --> 20:09.060
backlash from weirdos, and it worked.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.960
They probably all made quite a lot of sales,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.360
which reminds me.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.860
My box of stuff from all of my favorite

20:14.860 --> 20:17.360
progressive-sounding companies arrived.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.360
Ooh, I wonder what's in it.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.660
What's this?

20:25.660 --> 20:26.460
That's weird.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.960
I'm not sure what this is.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.160
What could it possibly be?

20:29.160 --> 20:31.060
Oh, it's child labor.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.260
♪♪

20:33.260 --> 20:35.160
Aw, yeah, here it comes, baby.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.460
The generic 10-minute rant about how capitalism is bad

20:38.460 --> 20:40.460
that I do at the end of every video now.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.260
That's right, I made yet another video

20:42.260 --> 20:45.660
to turn out to secretly be all about capitalism.

20:45.660 --> 20:48.560
You thought I couldn't do it, but I did.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.160
Don't ever question me again!

20:50.160 --> 20:51.660
You don't need me to lecture you

20:51.660 --> 20:54.160
through Nike's history of sweatshop labor

20:54.160 --> 20:56.660
or their ongoing allegations of poor work conditions

20:56.660 --> 20:58.460
often pulling production from factories

20:58.460 --> 20:59.760
that threaten to unionize

20:59.760 --> 21:01.860
and refusing to let the Workers' Rights Consortium

21:01.860 --> 21:03.160
inspect their factories.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.460
You don't need me to go into exacting detail

21:05.460 --> 21:07.560
about Gillette's owners, Procter & Gamble,

21:07.560 --> 21:09.660
a giant corporation who are implicated

21:09.660 --> 21:10.760
in all kinds of stuff,

21:10.760 --> 21:12.460
or the general way big businesses

21:12.460 --> 21:14.260
are unethical on so many levels.

21:14.260 --> 21:16.460
I'm not even gonna get into the pink tax,

21:16.460 --> 21:17.960
the way companies like Gillette

21:17.960 --> 21:20.060
can often say vaguely progressive things

21:20.060 --> 21:21.960
but will happily charge women more

21:21.960 --> 21:23.660
for effectively the same product

21:23.660 --> 21:25.360
if they think they can get away with it.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.360
And don't even get me started on Keurig.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.160
Their coffee isn't very nice.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.260
And also a bunch of labor violations.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.260
You know most of this stuff happens already,

21:36.260 --> 21:37.860
and we all know it's bad.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.960
I'm not saying you should personally feel bad

21:39.960 --> 21:42.160
for buying the products of these companies either.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.960
Almost every company has something

21:43.960 --> 21:45.460
in their production chain which,

21:45.460 --> 21:46.560
if you sat and looked at it,

21:46.560 --> 21:48.060
you'd probably find unethical.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.260
That's the world we live in,

21:49.260 --> 21:50.960
and we don't change it by feeling bad

21:50.960 --> 21:52.660
about our tacit participation.

21:52.660 --> 21:54.760
We change it by trying to find ways

21:54.760 --> 21:56.360
of altering the way things are.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.360
The point here is that businesses exist

21:58.360 --> 21:59.360
to make money.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.260
Sometimes that's in the form of moving jobs

22:01.260 --> 22:02.860
to a country that does it cheaper,

22:02.860 --> 22:04.660
often because they don't have to treat

22:04.660 --> 22:05.760
their workers as well.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.260
Sometimes it's in the form of fiddling

22:07.260 --> 22:09.360
their taxes so much that not only did they

22:09.360 --> 22:10.760
pay less taxes than you,

22:10.760 --> 22:12.360
you technically paid them.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.160
Sometimes it's in the form of charging women

22:14.160 --> 22:15.360
more for pink razors,

22:15.360 --> 22:17.460
and sometimes it's in finding new ways

22:17.460 --> 22:19.760
to make you think about buying their product.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.960
These clips sound nice.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.560
Inspirational, even.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.260
They say things that not only do I agree with,

22:26.260 --> 22:27.760
but which I think are normal

22:27.760 --> 22:30.360
and not in the slightest bit radical.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.360
But they're commercials.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.860
Their purpose is to sell you things.

22:34.860 --> 22:36.360
They're a marketing strategy

22:36.360 --> 22:38.960
with little to no impact on the actual problems

22:38.960 --> 22:40.260
that threaten our world.

22:40.260 --> 22:41.760
I mean, heck, they won't even admit

22:41.760 --> 22:44.060
their commercials are commercials anymore.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.860
They're short films.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.860
It's got a cinematic aspect ratio,

22:47.860 --> 22:50.160
so you know it's classy and not an ad.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.360
There's this sequence where they play

22:51.360 --> 22:53.060
an old Gillette ad and symbolically

22:53.060 --> 22:55.360
break through it as if to surpass it,

22:55.360 --> 22:57.660
but this is all window dressing designed to disguise

22:57.660 --> 23:00.060
that you are being sold something.

23:00.060 --> 23:02.660
It's really insidious to me how completely

23:02.660 --> 23:04.560
companies are trying to mask the fact

23:04.560 --> 23:05.960
that that's what they're doing.

23:05.960 --> 23:08.460
They're still just trying to find a way to get you,

23:08.460 --> 23:10.860
and it turns out that people don't go

23:10.860 --> 23:12.560
for hiring a model to pretend to eat

23:12.560 --> 23:14.360
a sandy pineapple burger anymore.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.760
They go for something that sounds

23:15.760 --> 23:17.660
really progressive and forward-thinking

23:17.660 --> 23:19.160
and that all the weirdos on Twitter

23:19.160 --> 23:20.460
seem to be mad about.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.260
It's just like dear old dad always used to tell me.

23:23.260 --> 23:27.060
Son, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.

23:28.260 --> 23:29.260
Actually, that's a lie.

23:29.260 --> 23:30.860
That's my fantasy.

23:30.860 --> 23:32.360
Dad mostly just sat in the corner

23:32.360 --> 23:33.860
and read Victor Klemperer books.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.760
But I'm the Victor Klemperer of my age, father!

23:36.760 --> 23:39.360
I tell everyone which video games are bad!

23:39.360 --> 23:41.260
Brands are not our friends,

23:41.260 --> 23:43.060
but it is nice, isn't it?

23:43.060 --> 23:45.060
I mean, I can make fun of people for buying razors

23:45.060 --> 23:46.660
just to spite some weirdos online

23:46.660 --> 23:48.760
or for liking a commercial or whatever,

23:48.760 --> 23:51.760
but it is pretty cool that a company

23:51.760 --> 23:54.260
actually invited discussion of these issues.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.660
Just keep in mind that there are deeper problems

23:56.660 --> 23:59.760
with these companies that we do need to talk about and solve,

23:59.760 --> 24:01.460
and don't let them buy your allegiance

24:01.460 --> 24:03.460
by saying something vaguely progressive-sounding

24:03.460 --> 24:04.460
in a commercial.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.860
Besides, there are better, less invasive,

24:06.860 --> 24:08.760
more genuine ways of getting your product

24:08.760 --> 24:10.560
out there to people.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.660
Which brings me to CuriosityStream.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.060
CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming service

24:15.060 --> 24:17.060
that offers over 2,000 documentaries

24:17.060 --> 24:18.860
and non-fiction titles from some of the world's

24:18.860 --> 24:21.360
best filmmakers, including exclusive originals

24:21.360 --> 24:22.960
made specifically for the platform.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.460
It's created by John Hendricks,

24:24.460 --> 24:26.160
the guy who founded the Discovery Channel,

24:26.160 --> 24:27.660
and I really enjoyed a series on there

24:27.660 --> 24:28.860
called History of Food,

24:28.860 --> 24:30.460
which tracks the invention of cooking

24:30.460 --> 24:31.460
millions of years ago,

24:31.460 --> 24:33.660
the development of processes like fermentation

24:33.660 --> 24:35.860
and bread-making and how this allowed civilization

24:35.860 --> 24:38.260
to prosper, all the way to the modern food industry

24:38.260 --> 24:39.960
and its more modern problems.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.460
I am currently in the process of making a couple of videos

24:42.460 --> 24:45.260
about diet science and junk diets and stuff like that,

24:45.260 --> 24:46.560
so if you watch this series,

24:46.560 --> 24:48.660
you'll know exactly where I stole everything from.

24:48.660 --> 24:50.260
Access to everything on the platform

24:50.260 --> 24:54.260
costs $2.99 a month or $19.99 a year,

24:54.260 --> 24:56.560
but if you go to curiositystream.com

24:56.560 --> 24:57.860
slash hbomberguy,

24:57.860 --> 25:00.560
your membership will be free for the first 30 days.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.060
Hey, thanks for watching the commercial

25:02.060 --> 25:03.360
all the way through, too.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.060
I think now would be a good time to bring up

25:05.060 --> 25:06.460
that this stuff can all happen

25:06.460 --> 25:08.560
in the opposite direction, too.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.860
Watch out for right-wing commercials

25:10.860 --> 25:12.560
that promote traditional values

25:12.560 --> 25:15.460
or are weirdly loving of Donald Trump.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.960
Uh, I mean, there's already, like, a watch commercial

25:17.960 --> 25:21.060
that's, like, a response to the Gillette thing

25:21.060 --> 25:23.260
where they're like, men have it way hard in there.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.760
The next time a commercial like that comes out,

25:25.760 --> 25:28.760
which it will because this stuff goes in any direction,

25:28.760 --> 25:31.860
marketing companies know what they're doing,

25:31.860 --> 25:33.460
just don't worry about it.

25:33.460 --> 25:36.360
You know, like, there are so many important problems

25:36.360 --> 25:38.560
in the world right now that are worth talking about

25:38.560 --> 25:40.460
and worth solving,

25:40.460 --> 25:43.460
and in the scheme of that,

25:43.460 --> 25:45.660
commercials that say something you don't like

25:45.660 --> 25:48.660
are effectively a trick to waste your time,

25:48.660 --> 25:50.760
and your time is better spent than that

25:50.760 --> 25:52.360
because I love you,

25:52.360 --> 25:55.060
and there are people in your life right now,

25:55.060 --> 25:57.960
even you, who could benefit from that time,

25:57.960 --> 26:00.260
so spend it on them instead.

26:00.260 --> 26:01.960
You have my permission now.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.260
Heh. I guess.

26:04.260 --> 26:07.260
Um, and I hope you have a really great night.

26:07.260 --> 26:08.660
Do something you enjoy.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.660
I've been really into hummus lately.

26:10.660 --> 26:13.360
Check that out, and look up cool time management skills

26:13.360 --> 26:15.060
if you haven't. It turns out it's a really great thing.

26:15.060 --> 26:17.460
I got this video out, like, two weeks early.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.760
Um, yeah, take care of yourselves,

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
and, uh, have a good night,

26:20.760 --> 26:22.760
and brands are not your friends.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.360
Um, thanks, CuriosityStream, for the sponsorship.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.960
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
I'm screwed.

26:30.960 --> 26:36.560
Uh, love yourself, and take care.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
Bye.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.760
Oh, I also have a Patreon.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
Oh, I forgot to...
