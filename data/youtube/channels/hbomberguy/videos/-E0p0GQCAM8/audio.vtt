00:00.000 --> 00:14.520
There weren't enough white people in the new Star Wars. I thought this opinion would be

00:14.520 --> 00:19.920
shared by my fellow critics, but unfortunately, thanks to political correctness, censorship,

00:19.920 --> 00:24.920
leftist midichlorians, most mainstream critics seem to only talk about the directing, the

00:24.920 --> 00:29.640
editing, the sound, the cinematography, the symbolism, and the acting. None of the important

00:29.640 --> 00:35.400
stuff. There are sequences in it in which the landscapes were, as you said, beautiful.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.920
They were genuinely breathtaking. They reminded you of that sense of, you know, interplanetary

00:40.920 --> 00:48.600
awe. But I wonder what the internet thought of Star Wars colon The Force Awakens. Okay,

00:48.600 --> 00:52.560
for this video, I was going to have a segment where I watch Anita Sarkeesian's review of

00:52.560 --> 00:56.880
The Force Awakens with my camera on and react to it in real time, but once I'd started,

00:56.880 --> 01:00.840
I found there really wasn't anything to react to. She's gotten really good at hiding the

01:00.840 --> 01:05.680
fact she's secretly two Hitlers behind layers of straightforward, understandable criticism

01:05.680 --> 01:10.960
for Monster. It must take a lot of skill and talent to be constantly outraged at her opinions

01:10.960 --> 01:15.480
for money. I couldn't even muster the anger to Photoshop her company logo into fascist

01:15.480 --> 01:20.560
propaganda. In the time it takes you to make one of those propaganda posters, you could

01:20.560 --> 01:24.320
have done all kinds of far more interesting things. You could have written your own opinion

01:24.320 --> 01:28.560
in a way that is actually productive and communicates new ideas and maybe even convinces

01:28.560 --> 01:34.400
someone to change their mind and see things your way. You know, you could have watched

01:34.400 --> 01:40.040
a Star Wars film, or you could do something even better. You could go on eBay and buy

01:40.040 --> 01:44.960
Star Wars PEZ dispensers. You're going to see these in a joke in the video later on.

01:44.960 --> 01:53.000
It's going to be great. You see? And that's what being productive is all about. PEZ dispenser

01:53.000 --> 01:59.180
would you like? I'm doing a Yoda thing because he's Yoda. There isn't a PEZ in this one,

01:59.180 --> 02:03.960
so I've fucked up this take. If you want some really badass opinions, you're going to have

02:03.960 --> 02:11.480
to delve deep with me into the world of alt-right wing crazy people. I would call it the dark

02:11.480 --> 02:16.640
side, but they're all white. I wonder what the best way to find incredibly advanced intelligent

02:16.640 --> 02:22.840
opinions about Star Wars is. Maybe I should try a pun like the farce awakens? Rocking

02:22.840 --> 02:28.600
mystery AND Thunderf00t used that pun? Fucking bingo! Returning truth teller, rocking MRA.

02:28.600 --> 02:36.480
Sorry, rocking Mr. E. Mystery? Mr. E has something to say about the Star Wars films. Let's watch.

02:36.480 --> 02:45.480
SJWs ruined Star Wars. This is going to be one fucking badass Star Wars review, let me

02:45.480 --> 02:54.000
tell you. I've always been very fond of Star Wars. I strongly suspected that something

02:54.000 --> 02:59.680
wasn't right, since mainstream critics are generally leftists pushing an agenda. With

02:59.680 --> 03:06.120
this video, I'm going to explain how and why everything about The Force Awakens was completely

03:06.120 --> 03:12.000
shaped around a leftist social justice warrior agenda. Everything? Oh man, he's going to

03:12.000 --> 03:16.720
talk about the direction of the film or the sound design or the cinematography or the

03:16.720 --> 03:23.320
editing or the symbolism. I was already expecting straight white males to take a back seat,

03:23.320 --> 03:29.360
but this acceptance was completely inadequate for the myriad of problems with the movie.

03:29.360 --> 03:36.000
Star Wars has always been most loved by young white males, but like comics and everything

03:36.000 --> 03:41.440
else white males enjoy, they now have to share or give up their culture. They have to share

03:41.440 --> 03:50.840
my comics with girls. Women have a rich history in cinema, with roles like Ripley in Ridley

03:50.840 --> 03:59.840
Scott Aliens, Catwoman in Tim Burton's Batman or Princess Leia in George Lucas' Star Wars.

03:59.840 --> 04:05.880
Sci-fi and fantasy should adhere to rules set by the storyteller. The Force Awakens

04:05.880 --> 04:12.640
not only fails to do this, but even sacrifices old rules to pander to SJW ideology.

04:12.640 --> 04:17.200
He spends a good long time holding on this picture of Rey. I like to think she's reacting

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
to what he's saying.

04:18.200 --> 04:25.680
SJWs reacted to Avengers Age of Ultron, trolling, harassing and bullying Joss Whedon on Twitter.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.560
Though Whedon denies he left Twitter for this reason...

04:29.560 --> 04:33.520
In this part she's probably thinking, why is he talking about Joss Whedon being harassed

04:33.520 --> 04:39.920
on Twitter by idiots? I thought this video was about Star Wars. Unsubscribed.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.280
Luke took three movies to grow as a character, and throughout the original trilogy Luke was

04:45.280 --> 04:48.400
saved and helped at multiple points.

04:48.400 --> 04:55.680
She's not exactly like Luke Skywalker. No, she's not like the old ones. I guarantee you

04:55.680 --> 05:00.180
right now at some point he's going to complain that it's a rehash of A New Hope, right?

05:00.180 --> 05:07.180
The second protagonist of the film, Finn, was also a product of SJW ideology. It's clear

05:07.180 --> 05:13.780
his primary role was to fill diversity quotas. Finn was a poor substitute for previous black

05:13.780 --> 05:20.140
roles, Mace Windu and Lando Calrissian, while John Boyega is the effeminate male actor.

05:20.140 --> 05:26.140
So one black actor was just to fill a quota, but the other two were what, just normal black

05:26.140 --> 05:27.140
people?

05:27.140 --> 05:33.220
Finn was a character that made no sense. He had no Jedi training that could fight with

05:33.220 --> 05:34.220
a lightsaber.

05:34.220 --> 05:41.220
Jedi training? It's a stick! It's a glowing stick! Hayden Christensen can swing that stick

05:41.220 --> 05:47.540
like a ballerina, and he's the clumsiest person in the world! Han Solo uses it at one point.

05:47.540 --> 05:51.980
Man, it's weird how you forgot about the scene where Han Solo saves Luke's life. You'd think

05:51.980 --> 05:53.900
a fan would remember that sort of thing.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.860
I've always been very fond of Star Wars.

05:58.860 --> 06:03.860
By the way, word of advice, if you're reading from a script, don't wave your head around

06:03.860 --> 06:09.500
as you stare at it like that for emphasis, because people can then tell that you're just

06:09.500 --> 06:15.000
reading from a script, and it kind of defeats the whole purpose of orating to a person.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.340
When I talk to a human being, I look at them. I don't go, let me read from my pre-prepared

06:20.340 --> 06:26.340
notes here to you, Dad. I would like you to give me back my phone.

06:26.340 --> 06:32.860
If we look past Rey and Finn, The Force Awakens was still a tragic affair. The plot was such

06:32.860 --> 06:36.140
a rehash of A New Hope that this could not...

06:36.140 --> 06:40.500
I fucking called it!

06:40.500 --> 06:43.800
In this video, I've only scratched the surface of...

06:43.800 --> 06:48.460
I agree, it's been like eight and a half minutes, and you've not even really talked about the

06:49.460 --> 06:54.460
Maybe you should do a redo. Oh, I guess I'm watching it, so I didn't. Why am I giving the screen advice?

07:01.460 --> 07:03.960
That's a great font. That'll just scare leftists right off.

07:03.960 --> 07:09.260
By the way, when you're making a logo, try not to incorporate three different fonts at once.

07:09.260 --> 07:15.020
It's not good on the eyes. You'll notice that the Star Wars logo is clean, crisp, and consistent.

07:15.020 --> 07:21.020
It doesn't look like this. When you completely avoid talking about the audio and visual aspects

07:21.020 --> 07:26.360
of a medium that's mostly audio and visual, in fact, it's all of it, you might be doing

07:26.360 --> 07:32.120
analysis wrong. Apparently, it's more of a controversial box-ticking move now to have

07:32.120 --> 07:36.840
a black main character than it was 30 years ago, and that's messed up.

07:36.840 --> 07:41.240
It's been a couple of years since Rocking Mystery's video about cultural Marxists, so

07:41.240 --> 07:45.240
Maybe he's gotten a bit better at having a real discussion with people.

07:47.240 --> 07:50.240
I just scrolled down. No. No, he doesn't.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.240
You're cries of wolf. Cries of wolf.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.240
Rocking Mystery, do you have your pills this week?

08:17.240 --> 08:23.240
Well, Rocking Mystery's half right. I'm done with someone's hateful accusations. Goodbye.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.240
Next time on whatever this series is called. Note to self, think of a name.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.240
Wait, am I supposed to read this part out loud?

08:29.240 --> 08:35.240
Listen up, old white man. J.J. Abrams hates you. He relishes the thought of your extinction.

08:35.240 --> 08:39.240
Wow, they cast a black woman to play Hermione in a Harry Potter play.

08:39.240 --> 08:43.240
My country is full of crime thanks to the love of diversity.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.240
The Little White Cockball.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.240
The Little White Cockball.
