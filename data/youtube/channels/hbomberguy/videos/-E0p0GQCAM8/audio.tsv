0	14520	There weren't enough white people in the new Star Wars. I thought this opinion would be
14520	19920	shared by my fellow critics, but unfortunately, thanks to political correctness, censorship,
19920	24920	leftist midichlorians, most mainstream critics seem to only talk about the directing, the
24920	29640	editing, the sound, the cinematography, the symbolism, and the acting. None of the important
29640	35400	stuff. There are sequences in it in which the landscapes were, as you said, beautiful.
35400	40920	They were genuinely breathtaking. They reminded you of that sense of, you know, interplanetary
40920	48600	awe. But I wonder what the internet thought of Star Wars colon The Force Awakens. Okay,
48600	52560	for this video, I was going to have a segment where I watch Anita Sarkeesian's review of
52560	56880	The Force Awakens with my camera on and react to it in real time, but once I'd started,
56880	60840	I found there really wasn't anything to react to. She's gotten really good at hiding the
60840	65680	fact she's secretly two Hitlers behind layers of straightforward, understandable criticism
65680	70960	for Monster. It must take a lot of skill and talent to be constantly outraged at her opinions
70960	75480	for money. I couldn't even muster the anger to Photoshop her company logo into fascist
75480	80560	propaganda. In the time it takes you to make one of those propaganda posters, you could
80560	84320	have done all kinds of far more interesting things. You could have written your own opinion
84320	88560	in a way that is actually productive and communicates new ideas and maybe even convinces
88560	94400	someone to change their mind and see things your way. You know, you could have watched
94400	100040	a Star Wars film, or you could do something even better. You could go on eBay and buy
100040	104960	Star Wars PEZ dispensers. You're going to see these in a joke in the video later on.
104960	113000	It's going to be great. You see? And that's what being productive is all about. PEZ dispenser
113000	119180	would you like? I'm doing a Yoda thing because he's Yoda. There isn't a PEZ in this one,
119180	123960	so I've fucked up this take. If you want some really badass opinions, you're going to have
123960	131480	to delve deep with me into the world of alt-right wing crazy people. I would call it the dark
131480	136640	side, but they're all white. I wonder what the best way to find incredibly advanced intelligent
136640	142840	opinions about Star Wars is. Maybe I should try a pun like the farce awakens? Rocking
142840	148600	mystery AND Thunderf00t used that pun? Fucking bingo! Returning truth teller, rocking MRA.
148600	156480	Sorry, rocking Mr. E. Mystery? Mr. E has something to say about the Star Wars films. Let's watch.
156480	165480	SJWs ruined Star Wars. This is going to be one fucking badass Star Wars review, let me
165480	174000	tell you. I've always been very fond of Star Wars. I strongly suspected that something
174000	179680	wasn't right, since mainstream critics are generally leftists pushing an agenda. With
179680	186120	this video, I'm going to explain how and why everything about The Force Awakens was completely
186120	192000	shaped around a leftist social justice warrior agenda. Everything? Oh man, he's going to
192000	196720	talk about the direction of the film or the sound design or the cinematography or the
196720	203320	editing or the symbolism. I was already expecting straight white males to take a back seat,
203320	209360	but this acceptance was completely inadequate for the myriad of problems with the movie.
209360	216000	Star Wars has always been most loved by young white males, but like comics and everything
216000	221440	else white males enjoy, they now have to share or give up their culture. They have to share
221440	230840	my comics with girls. Women have a rich history in cinema, with roles like Ripley in Ridley
230840	239840	Scott Aliens, Catwoman in Tim Burton's Batman or Princess Leia in George Lucas' Star Wars.
239840	245880	Sci-fi and fantasy should adhere to rules set by the storyteller. The Force Awakens
245880	252640	not only fails to do this, but even sacrifices old rules to pander to SJW ideology.
252640	257200	He spends a good long time holding on this picture of Rey. I like to think she's reacting
257200	258200	to what he's saying.
258200	265680	SJWs reacted to Avengers Age of Ultron, trolling, harassing and bullying Joss Whedon on Twitter.
265680	269560	Though Whedon denies he left Twitter for this reason...
269560	273520	In this part she's probably thinking, why is he talking about Joss Whedon being harassed
273520	279920	on Twitter by idiots? I thought this video was about Star Wars. Unsubscribed.
279920	285280	Luke took three movies to grow as a character, and throughout the original trilogy Luke was
285280	288400	saved and helped at multiple points.
288400	295680	She's not exactly like Luke Skywalker. No, she's not like the old ones. I guarantee you
295680	300180	right now at some point he's going to complain that it's a rehash of A New Hope, right?
300180	307180	The second protagonist of the film, Finn, was also a product of SJW ideology. It's clear
307180	313780	his primary role was to fill diversity quotas. Finn was a poor substitute for previous black
313780	320140	roles, Mace Windu and Lando Calrissian, while John Boyega is the effeminate male actor.
320140	326140	So one black actor was just to fill a quota, but the other two were what, just normal black
326140	327140	people?
327140	333220	Finn was a character that made no sense. He had no Jedi training that could fight with
333220	334220	a lightsaber.
334220	341220	Jedi training? It's a stick! It's a glowing stick! Hayden Christensen can swing that stick
341220	347540	like a ballerina, and he's the clumsiest person in the world! Han Solo uses it at one point.
347540	351980	Man, it's weird how you forgot about the scene where Han Solo saves Luke's life. You'd think
351980	353900	a fan would remember that sort of thing.
353900	358860	I've always been very fond of Star Wars.
358860	363860	By the way, word of advice, if you're reading from a script, don't wave your head around
363860	369500	as you stare at it like that for emphasis, because people can then tell that you're just
369500	375000	reading from a script, and it kind of defeats the whole purpose of orating to a person.
375000	380340	When I talk to a human being, I look at them. I don't go, let me read from my pre-prepared
380340	386340	notes here to you, Dad. I would like you to give me back my phone.
386340	392860	If we look past Rey and Finn, The Force Awakens was still a tragic affair. The plot was such
392860	396140	a rehash of A New Hope that this could not...
396140	400500	I fucking called it!
400500	403800	In this video, I've only scratched the surface of...
403800	408460	I agree, it's been like eight and a half minutes, and you've not even really talked about the
409460	414460	Maybe you should do a redo. Oh, I guess I'm watching it, so I didn't. Why am I giving the screen advice?
421460	423960	That's a great font. That'll just scare leftists right off.
423960	429260	By the way, when you're making a logo, try not to incorporate three different fonts at once.
429260	435020	It's not good on the eyes. You'll notice that the Star Wars logo is clean, crisp, and consistent.
435020	441020	It doesn't look like this. When you completely avoid talking about the audio and visual aspects
441020	446360	of a medium that's mostly audio and visual, in fact, it's all of it, you might be doing
446360	452120	analysis wrong. Apparently, it's more of a controversial box-ticking move now to have
452120	456840	a black main character than it was 30 years ago, and that's messed up.
456840	461240	It's been a couple of years since Rocking Mystery's video about cultural Marxists, so
461240	465240	Maybe he's gotten a bit better at having a real discussion with people.
467240	470240	I just scrolled down. No. No, he doesn't.
491240	494240	You're cries of wolf. Cries of wolf.
494240	497240	Rocking Mystery, do you have your pills this week?
497240	503240	Well, Rocking Mystery's half right. I'm done with someone's hateful accusations. Goodbye.
503240	507240	Next time on whatever this series is called. Note to self, think of a name.
507240	509240	Wait, am I supposed to read this part out loud?
509240	515240	Listen up, old white man. J.J. Abrams hates you. He relishes the thought of your extinction.
515240	519240	Wow, they cast a black woman to play Hermione in a Harry Potter play.
519240	523240	My country is full of crime thanks to the love of diversity.
526240	530240	The Little White Cockball.
