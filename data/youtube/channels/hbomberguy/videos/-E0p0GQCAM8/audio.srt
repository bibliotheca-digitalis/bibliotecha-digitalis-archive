1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
There weren't enough white people in the new Star Wars. I thought this opinion would be

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,920
shared by my fellow critics, but unfortunately, thanks to political correctness, censorship,

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,920
leftist midichlorians, most mainstream critics seem to only talk about the directing, the

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,640
editing, the sound, the cinematography, the symbolism, and the acting. None of the important

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,400
stuff. There are sequences in it in which the landscapes were, as you said, beautiful.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,920
They were genuinely breathtaking. They reminded you of that sense of, you know, interplanetary

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,600
awe. But I wonder what the internet thought of Star Wars colon The Force Awakens. Okay,

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,560
for this video, I was going to have a segment where I watch Anita Sarkeesian's review of

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,880
The Force Awakens with my camera on and react to it in real time, but once I'd started,

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,840
I found there really wasn't anything to react to. She's gotten really good at hiding the

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,680
fact she's secretly two Hitlers behind layers of straightforward, understandable criticism

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,960
for Monster. It must take a lot of skill and talent to be constantly outraged at her opinions

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,480
for money. I couldn't even muster the anger to Photoshop her company logo into fascist

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,560
propaganda. In the time it takes you to make one of those propaganda posters, you could

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
have done all kinds of far more interesting things. You could have written your own opinion

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,560
in a way that is actually productive and communicates new ideas and maybe even convinces

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,400
someone to change their mind and see things your way. You know, you could have watched

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,040
a Star Wars film, or you could do something even better. You could go on eBay and buy

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,960
Star Wars PEZ dispensers. You're going to see these in a joke in the video later on.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:53,000
It's going to be great. You see? And that's what being productive is all about. PEZ dispenser

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,180
would you like? I'm doing a Yoda thing because he's Yoda. There isn't a PEZ in this one,

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,960
so I've fucked up this take. If you want some really badass opinions, you're going to have

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,480
to delve deep with me into the world of alt-right wing crazy people. I would call it the dark

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,640
side, but they're all white. I wonder what the best way to find incredibly advanced intelligent

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,840
opinions about Star Wars is. Maybe I should try a pun like the farce awakens? Rocking

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,600
mystery AND Thunderf00t used that pun? Fucking bingo! Returning truth teller, rocking MRA.

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:36,480
Sorry, rocking Mr. E. Mystery? Mr. E has something to say about the Star Wars films. Let's watch.

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,480
SJWs ruined Star Wars. This is going to be one fucking badass Star Wars review, let me

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,000
tell you. I've always been very fond of Star Wars. I strongly suspected that something

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,680
wasn't right, since mainstream critics are generally leftists pushing an agenda. With

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,120
this video, I'm going to explain how and why everything about The Force Awakens was completely

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,000
shaped around a leftist social justice warrior agenda. Everything? Oh man, he's going to

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,720
talk about the direction of the film or the sound design or the cinematography or the

34
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,320
editing or the symbolism. I was already expecting straight white males to take a back seat,

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,360
but this acceptance was completely inadequate for the myriad of problems with the movie.

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,000
Star Wars has always been most loved by young white males, but like comics and everything

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,440
else white males enjoy, they now have to share or give up their culture. They have to share

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:50,840
my comics with girls. Women have a rich history in cinema, with roles like Ripley in Ridley

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Scott Aliens, Catwoman in Tim Burton's Batman or Princess Leia in George Lucas' Star Wars.

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,880
Sci-fi and fantasy should adhere to rules set by the storyteller. The Force Awakens

41
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,640
not only fails to do this, but even sacrifices old rules to pander to SJW ideology.

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,200
He spends a good long time holding on this picture of Rey. I like to think she's reacting

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
to what he's saying.

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:25,680
SJWs reacted to Avengers Age of Ultron, trolling, harassing and bullying Joss Whedon on Twitter.

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,560
Though Whedon denies he left Twitter for this reason...

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,520
In this part she's probably thinking, why is he talking about Joss Whedon being harassed

47
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,920
on Twitter by idiots? I thought this video was about Star Wars. Unsubscribed.

48
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,280
Luke took three movies to grow as a character, and throughout the original trilogy Luke was

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
saved and helped at multiple points.

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,680
She's not exactly like Luke Skywalker. No, she's not like the old ones. I guarantee you

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,180
right now at some point he's going to complain that it's a rehash of A New Hope, right?

52
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,180
The second protagonist of the film, Finn, was also a product of SJW ideology. It's clear

53
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,780
his primary role was to fill diversity quotas. Finn was a poor substitute for previous black

54
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,140
roles, Mace Windu and Lando Calrissian, while John Boyega is the effeminate male actor.

55
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,140
So one black actor was just to fill a quota, but the other two were what, just normal black

56
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
people?

57
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:33,220
Finn was a character that made no sense. He had no Jedi training that could fight with

58
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,220
a lightsaber.

59
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,220
Jedi training? It's a stick! It's a glowing stick! Hayden Christensen can swing that stick

60
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,540
like a ballerina, and he's the clumsiest person in the world! Han Solo uses it at one point.

61
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,980
Man, it's weird how you forgot about the scene where Han Solo saves Luke's life. You'd think

62
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,900
a fan would remember that sort of thing.

63
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,860
I've always been very fond of Star Wars.

64
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,860
By the way, word of advice, if you're reading from a script, don't wave your head around

65
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,500
as you stare at it like that for emphasis, because people can then tell that you're just

66
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,000
reading from a script, and it kind of defeats the whole purpose of orating to a person.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,340
When I talk to a human being, I look at them. I don't go, let me read from my pre-prepared

68
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,340
notes here to you, Dad. I would like you to give me back my phone.

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,860
If we look past Rey and Finn, The Force Awakens was still a tragic affair. The plot was such

70
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,140
a rehash of A New Hope that this could not...

71
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,500
I fucking called it!

72
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,800
In this video, I've only scratched the surface of...

73
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,460
I agree, it's been like eight and a half minutes, and you've not even really talked about the

74
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,460
Maybe you should do a redo. Oh, I guess I'm watching it, so I didn't. Why am I giving the screen advice?

75
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,960
That's a great font. That'll just scare leftists right off.

76
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,260
By the way, when you're making a logo, try not to incorporate three different fonts at once.

77
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,020
It's not good on the eyes. You'll notice that the Star Wars logo is clean, crisp, and consistent.

78
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:21,020
It doesn't look like this. When you completely avoid talking about the audio and visual aspects

79
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,360
of a medium that's mostly audio and visual, in fact, it's all of it, you might be doing

80
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,120
analysis wrong. Apparently, it's more of a controversial box-ticking move now to have

81
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,840
a black main character than it was 30 years ago, and that's messed up.

82
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,240
It's been a couple of years since Rocking Mystery's video about cultural Marxists, so

83
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Maybe he's gotten a bit better at having a real discussion with people.

84
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,240
I just scrolled down. No. No, he doesn't.

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
You're cries of wolf. Cries of wolf.

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Rocking Mystery, do you have your pills this week?

87
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Well, Rocking Mystery's half right. I'm done with someone's hateful accusations. Goodbye.

88
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Next time on whatever this series is called. Note to self, think of a name.

89
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Wait, am I supposed to read this part out loud?

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Listen up, old white man. J.J. Abrams hates you. He relishes the thought of your extinction.

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Wow, they cast a black woman to play Hermione in a Harry Potter play.

92
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,240
My country is full of crime thanks to the love of diversity.

93
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
The Little White Cockball.

94
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
The Little White Cockball.
