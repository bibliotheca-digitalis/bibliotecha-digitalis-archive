1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, uh, remember the time I said this?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,120
I never actually beat Donkey Kong 64 as a kid,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,040
so to finally put this little fucker to rest,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,220
I'm gonna stream it.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,760
Well, it's finally time.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,380
I've got all my affairs in order,

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,760
I've recovered from getting super sick repeatedly,

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,220
and I figured out why my internet would periodically melt down every few hours.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,020
It's time for the Donkey Kong 64 Nightmare Stream.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,020
DK64 is a game I never finished properly as a kid.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,380
I played the game for this long and couldn't beat it,

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,960
and since then, I've held a grudge.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,340
It beat me, but now, at long last,

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,060
it's time for the rematch.

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,300
At 8.30 p.m. UK time on January the 18th,

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,180
I'll be streaming this game start to finish.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,520
All the proceeds from this stream will go to Mermaids,

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,140
a charity which works to provide resources and support

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,900
to young people with gender dysphoria.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,820
I chose to support this charity because as a person living in Britain,

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,660
I find the media discussion surrounding this issue in my country,

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,340
especially in its tabloids, to be woefully misinformed,

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,260
and I'd like to do my bit to help support the people who do the hard work

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,840
of contributing to people's thinking on an important issue.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,180
I chose Mermaids in specific because when they were designated some funding

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,480
by the National Lottery,

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,180
Graham Linehan, a comedy writer who did some work on a good show,

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,020
uh, 20 years ago,

29
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,400
who happens to, uh, be a very normal man

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,940
who's just very angry about trans people all day nowadays,

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,240
went on Mumsnet and told them to email a lady from the National Lottery en masse

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,120
and now the funding is under review.

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,280
So, well done, Graham!

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,860
You have a massive audience and the power to choose to fight for progress

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,540
in all the many forms we need in the world right now

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,840
and you used it to make sure some children won't have access to helpful resources.

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,220
Well, not really. They're probably still gonna get the funding

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,620
once the National Lottery realizes the outreach they received

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,500
was a celebrity deliberately telling Mumsnetters to email poor Dawn

40
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,140
thousands of fake, copy-pasted sock puppet emails of quote-unquote concern

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,840
and on top of that, now tons more people know about Mermaids

42
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,820
and want to support them just to spite you.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,540
Good job raising awareness for a charity, genius!

44
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Please talk loudly and angrily about more people who need support!

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,620
You fucking trash man!

46
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,380
You piss boy!

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,340
You prodigious buffoon!

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,840
So, for this stream, the goal is to beat Donkey Kong 64 100%.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,340
That means doing everything.

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm even gonna grab the items that don't count towards the percentage completion score.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,720
Even the weird coin no one knew existed for 20 years!

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,780
It's gonna be...a time?

53
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,360
An amount of time will pass.

54
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,200
I think the normal charity thing is to go 24 hours,

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,240
but honestly, there's no time limit on this thing.

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,160
I want to destroy Donkey Kong 64.

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,320
So until that has been achieved, the stream doesn't stop.

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't care if I fall asleep.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
I don't care if I run out of food.

60
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,300
The stream will continue!

61
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,080
Uh, my contact at Twitch warns me that it's against the terms of service to die on stream

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,460
and I do want to keep my Twitch account, so if I need to, I promise I will sleep,

63
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,700
but if you donate, the noise will probably wake me up.

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,300
So, thanks to you, the torture never has to end!

65
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,380
By the way, speaking of my Twitch channel,

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,540
did you know I have a Twitch channel?

67
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,960
I don't bring it up very often. I don't do branding.

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,600
No one watches my streams or knows they exist, but the moral high ground is mine.

69
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,060
I also have an archive channel on YouTube where I put up old streams once they're done,

70
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,100
so if you want to watch old streams, uh, they're there. Check them out.

71
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,680
Anyway, I hope to see you all there.

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,900
Have a great night.

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,400
Don't forget to moisturize.

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,240
And fuck you, Graham!

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,040
