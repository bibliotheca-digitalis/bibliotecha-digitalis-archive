0	2000	Hey, uh, remember the time I said this?
2000	5120	I never actually beat Donkey Kong 64 as a kid,
5120	9040	so to finally put this little fucker to rest,
9040	10220	I'm gonna stream it.
10220	12760	Well, it's finally time.
12760	14380	I've got all my affairs in order,
14380	16760	I've recovered from getting super sick repeatedly,
16760	20220	and I figured out why my internet would periodically melt down every few hours.
20220	25020	It's time for the Donkey Kong 64 Nightmare Stream.
25020	28020	DK64 is a game I never finished properly as a kid.
28040	30380	I played the game for this long and couldn't beat it,
30380	32960	and since then, I've held a grudge.
32960	36340	It beat me, but now, at long last,
36340	38060	it's time for the rematch.
38060	41300	At 8.30 p.m. UK time on January the 18th,
41300	43180	I'll be streaming this game start to finish.
43180	45520	All the proceeds from this stream will go to Mermaids,
45520	48140	a charity which works to provide resources and support
48140	49900	to young people with gender dysphoria.
49900	52820	I chose to support this charity because as a person living in Britain,
52820	55660	I find the media discussion surrounding this issue in my country,
55680	58340	especially in its tabloids, to be woefully misinformed,
58340	61260	and I'd like to do my bit to help support the people who do the hard work
61260	63840	of contributing to people's thinking on an important issue.
63840	67180	I chose Mermaids in specific because when they were designated some funding
67180	68480	by the National Lottery,
68480	72180	Graham Linehan, a comedy writer who did some work on a good show,
72180	74020	uh, 20 years ago,
74020	77400	who happens to, uh, be a very normal man
77400	80940	who's just very angry about trans people all day nowadays,
80940	85240	went on Mumsnet and told them to email a lady from the National Lottery en masse
85240	87120	and now the funding is under review.
87120	88280	So, well done, Graham!
88280	91860	You have a massive audience and the power to choose to fight for progress
91860	94540	in all the many forms we need in the world right now
94540	98840	and you used it to make sure some children won't have access to helpful resources.
98840	101220	Well, not really. They're probably still gonna get the funding
101220	103620	once the National Lottery realizes the outreach they received
103620	107500	was a celebrity deliberately telling Mumsnetters to email poor Dawn
107500	112140	thousands of fake, copy-pasted sock puppet emails of quote-unquote concern
112140	114840	and on top of that, now tons more people know about Mermaids
114860	116820	and want to support them just to spite you.
116820	119540	Good job raising awareness for a charity, genius!
119540	123540	Please talk loudly and angrily about more people who need support!
123540	125620	You fucking trash man!
125620	127380	You piss boy!
127380	129340	You prodigious buffoon!
129340	133840	So, for this stream, the goal is to beat Donkey Kong 64 100%.
133840	136340	That means doing everything.
136340	140480	I'm even gonna grab the items that don't count towards the percentage completion score.
140480	143720	Even the weird coin no one knew existed for 20 years!
143740	145780	It's gonna be...a time?
145780	148360	An amount of time will pass.
148360	151200	I think the normal charity thing is to go 24 hours,
151200	153240	but honestly, there's no time limit on this thing.
153240	156160	I want to destroy Donkey Kong 64.
156160	159320	So until that has been achieved, the stream doesn't stop.
159320	161000	I don't care if I fall asleep.
161000	162700	I don't care if I run out of food.
162700	164300	The stream will continue!
164300	169080	Uh, my contact at Twitch warns me that it's against the terms of service to die on stream
169080	173460	and I do want to keep my Twitch account, so if I need to, I promise I will sleep,
173460	175700	but if you donate, the noise will probably wake me up.
175700	178300	So, thanks to you, the torture never has to end!
178300	180380	By the way, speaking of my Twitch channel,
180380	182540	did you know I have a Twitch channel?
182540	184960	I don't bring it up very often. I don't do branding.
184960	188600	No one watches my streams or knows they exist, but the moral high ground is mine.
188600	193060	I also have an archive channel on YouTube where I put up old streams once they're done,
193060	196100	so if you want to watch old streams, uh, they're there. Check them out.
196100	197680	Anyway, I hope to see you all there.
197680	198900	Have a great night.
198900	200400	Don't forget to moisturize.
200400	202240	And fuck you, Graham!
