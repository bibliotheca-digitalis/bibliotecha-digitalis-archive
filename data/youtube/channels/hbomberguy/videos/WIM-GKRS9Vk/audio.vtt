00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hey, uh, remember the time I said this?

00:02.000 --> 00:05.120
I never actually beat Donkey Kong 64 as a kid,

00:05.120 --> 00:09.040
so to finally put this little fucker to rest,

00:09.040 --> 00:10.220
I'm gonna stream it.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.760
Well, it's finally time.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.380
I've got all my affairs in order,

00:14.380 --> 00:16.760
I've recovered from getting super sick repeatedly,

00:16.760 --> 00:20.220
and I figured out why my internet would periodically melt down every few hours.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.020
It's time for the Donkey Kong 64 Nightmare Stream.

00:25.020 --> 00:28.020
DK64 is a game I never finished properly as a kid.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.380
I played the game for this long and couldn't beat it,

00:30.380 --> 00:32.960
and since then, I've held a grudge.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.340
It beat me, but now, at long last,

00:36.340 --> 00:38.060
it's time for the rematch.

00:38.060 --> 00:41.300
At 8.30 p.m. UK time on January the 18th,

00:41.300 --> 00:43.180
I'll be streaming this game start to finish.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.520
All the proceeds from this stream will go to Mermaids,

00:45.520 --> 00:48.140
a charity which works to provide resources and support

00:48.140 --> 00:49.900
to young people with gender dysphoria.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.820
I chose to support this charity because as a person living in Britain,

00:52.820 --> 00:55.660
I find the media discussion surrounding this issue in my country,

00:55.680 --> 00:58.340
especially in its tabloids, to be woefully misinformed,

00:58.340 --> 01:01.260
and I'd like to do my bit to help support the people who do the hard work

01:01.260 --> 01:03.840
of contributing to people's thinking on an important issue.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.180
I chose Mermaids in specific because when they were designated some funding

01:07.180 --> 01:08.480
by the National Lottery,

01:08.480 --> 01:12.180
Graham Linehan, a comedy writer who did some work on a good show,

01:12.180 --> 01:14.020
uh, 20 years ago,

01:14.020 --> 01:17.400
who happens to, uh, be a very normal man

01:17.400 --> 01:20.940
who's just very angry about trans people all day nowadays,

01:20.940 --> 01:25.240
went on Mumsnet and told them to email a lady from the National Lottery en masse

01:25.240 --> 01:27.120
and now the funding is under review.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.280
So, well done, Graham!

01:28.280 --> 01:31.860
You have a massive audience and the power to choose to fight for progress

01:31.860 --> 01:34.540
in all the many forms we need in the world right now

01:34.540 --> 01:38.840
and you used it to make sure some children won't have access to helpful resources.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.220
Well, not really. They're probably still gonna get the funding

01:41.220 --> 01:43.620
once the National Lottery realizes the outreach they received

01:43.620 --> 01:47.500
was a celebrity deliberately telling Mumsnetters to email poor Dawn

01:47.500 --> 01:52.140
thousands of fake, copy-pasted sock puppet emails of quote-unquote concern

01:52.140 --> 01:54.840
and on top of that, now tons more people know about Mermaids

01:54.860 --> 01:56.820
and want to support them just to spite you.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.540
Good job raising awareness for a charity, genius!

01:59.540 --> 02:03.540
Please talk loudly and angrily about more people who need support!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.620
You fucking trash man!

02:05.620 --> 02:07.380
You piss boy!

02:07.380 --> 02:09.340
You prodigious buffoon!

02:09.340 --> 02:13.840
So, for this stream, the goal is to beat Donkey Kong 64 100%.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.340
That means doing everything.

02:16.340 --> 02:20.480
I'm even gonna grab the items that don't count towards the percentage completion score.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.720
Even the weird coin no one knew existed for 20 years!

02:23.740 --> 02:25.780
It's gonna be...a time?

02:25.780 --> 02:28.360
An amount of time will pass.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.200
I think the normal charity thing is to go 24 hours,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.240
but honestly, there's no time limit on this thing.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.160
I want to destroy Donkey Kong 64.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.320
So until that has been achieved, the stream doesn't stop.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.000
I don't care if I fall asleep.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.700
I don't care if I run out of food.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.300
The stream will continue!

02:44.300 --> 02:49.080
Uh, my contact at Twitch warns me that it's against the terms of service to die on stream

02:49.080 --> 02:53.460
and I do want to keep my Twitch account, so if I need to, I promise I will sleep,

02:53.460 --> 02:55.700
but if you donate, the noise will probably wake me up.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.300
So, thanks to you, the torture never has to end!

02:58.300 --> 03:00.380
By the way, speaking of my Twitch channel,

03:00.380 --> 03:02.540
did you know I have a Twitch channel?

03:02.540 --> 03:04.960
I don't bring it up very often. I don't do branding.

03:04.960 --> 03:08.600
No one watches my streams or knows they exist, but the moral high ground is mine.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.060
I also have an archive channel on YouTube where I put up old streams once they're done,

03:13.060 --> 03:16.100
so if you want to watch old streams, uh, they're there. Check them out.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.680
Anyway, I hope to see you all there.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.900
Have a great night.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.400
Don't forget to moisturize.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.240
And fuck you, Graham!

03:22.240 --> 03:27.040
