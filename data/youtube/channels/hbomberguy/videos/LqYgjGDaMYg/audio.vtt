WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.160
Ah, it's good to be back.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.160
When we last left off, I performed raw, hardcore, mostly uncensored analysis of all of Armored

00:23.160 --> 00:26.360
Skeptic's data supporting his view of gender expression.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.380
Which didn't take too long, because he didn't have any.

00:29.380 --> 00:32.900
This time, we're gonna do some more of that, about some more people.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.940
Nothing particularly unique this time, I just thought it'd be nice to cover a few more people.

00:36.940 --> 00:40.260
I wanted to do more last time, but the video started to feel like it was dragging, y'know?

00:40.260 --> 00:44.220
Let's have another look and see if there are any decent rebuttals to Nye's recent work.

00:44.220 --> 00:48.660
We'll be looking for a couple of basic things, like if the arguments actually hold water

00:48.660 --> 00:54.500
when you look at them, uh, if they have any, uh, sources or data that they cite, if they

00:54.500 --> 01:00.340
put it in the description, so people can click to check if it's actually right or not.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.500
Uh, y'know, really basic stuff like that.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.500
I'm sure that's a low bar that no one will be tripped over, right?

01:07.500 --> 01:10.500
WHO'S FIRST?

01:10.500 --> 01:13.100
[â™ª intro music â™ª

01:13.100 --> 01:14.100
BOOM

01:14.100 --> 01:16.100
Well, there's this Mouthy Buddha guy.

01:16.100 --> 01:20.100
His attempts to criticize Rachel Bloom's musical segment caused him to devolve into screaming

01:20.100 --> 01:25.100
MY PUSSY over and over until he was literally just reverberating and pulling a stupid face.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.100
MY PUSSY!

01:27.100 --> 01:30.100
MY PUSSY! MY PUSSY TALKS!

01:30.100 --> 01:32.100
MY PUSSY!

01:32.100 --> 01:35.100
MY PUSSY!

01:35.100 --> 01:37.100
He seems like a lovely individual.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.100
He's using the very popular rhetorical strategy of acting like a fucking idiot and then saying

01:41.100 --> 01:43.100
THAT'S WHAT I THINK FEMINISM IS!

01:43.100 --> 01:45.100
ME BEING STUPID PROVES THEY'RE STUPID!

01:45.100 --> 01:49.100
I put some jokes at his expense in the last video, and I thought it would be funny to just use

01:49.100 --> 01:52.100
that clip of him doing that and then not go back to him ever again.

01:52.100 --> 01:56.100
But even if I wanted to do more than that, I'd have some trouble because the video is mostly

01:56.100 --> 02:02.100
just him whining about how morally evil it is that Rachel Bloom empowered ignorant women,

02:02.100 --> 02:07.100
and how betrayed he feels by Bill Nye for not saying what he decided was true about the issue.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.100
Dude, name the smartest people in the world.

02:09.100 --> 02:13.100
They all think this gender fluidity shit is BULLSHIT!

02:13.100 --> 02:18.100
ðŸŽ¶

02:18.100 --> 02:23.100
ðŸŽ¶

02:23.100 --> 02:26.100
ðŸŽ¶

02:26.100 --> 02:28.100
ðŸŽ¶

02:28.100 --> 02:31.100
No evidence is necessary to support his beliefs, apparently.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.100
Who is this empowering?

02:33.100 --> 02:35.100
It's empowering ignorant women!

02:35.100 --> 02:40.100
People that you are dancing with are making our civilized western culture

02:40.100 --> 02:43.100
more and more degenerate every day.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.100
I thought feminists were worthless and unproductive members of society,

02:46.100 --> 02:50.100
but according to genius non-foot shooter Mouthy Buddha,

02:50.100 --> 02:54.100
it turns out that actually, western civilization is so weak and vulnerable

02:54.100 --> 02:59.100
that Rachel Bloom can destroy it with a song about her vagina.

02:59.100 --> 03:03.100
Listen, mate, if you think our great civilization is that weak,

03:03.100 --> 03:05.100
maybe you should move somewhere else.

03:05.100 --> 03:08.100
Presumably back to the spitting image puppet dimension.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.100
His other videos try really hard to be dramatic pseudo-documentaries

03:11.100 --> 03:15.100
with text effects, ornate fonts, and important sounding music

03:15.100 --> 03:19.100
as he talks in a dramatic voice about how IQ is totally a real measurement

03:19.100 --> 03:21.100
of human ability and behavior.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.100
We need to understand the validity of IQ

03:24.100 --> 03:28.100
to know that this is real and predictive of human behavior.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.100
ðŸŽ¶

03:31.100 --> 03:34.100
You know, for someone who seems incredibly certain

03:34.100 --> 03:37.100
that IQ is a valid and important unit of measuring a person's intelligence,

03:38.100 --> 03:42.100
Mouthy Buddha doesn't appear to have listed his own IQ anywhere.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.100
I invite you to come to the one conclusion there can be

03:47.100 --> 03:49.100
about why he wouldn't do that.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.100
These videos attempt to create the illusion that he's smart

03:52.100 --> 03:55.100
and needs to be taken seriously, but he's already put out a video

03:55.100 --> 03:57.100
where he whines and vibrates at a camera,

03:57.100 --> 03:59.100
so the genie's out of the bottle there, mate.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.100
While I could point and laugh at how he's a libertarian

04:01.100 --> 04:04.100
trying desperately to backpedal from supporting the alt-right

04:04.100 --> 04:06.100
after realizing that his bedfellows don't seem to realize

04:06.100 --> 04:08.100
that eugenics is unethical,

04:08.100 --> 04:11.100
or pretend that his other work means he's worth taking seriously,

04:11.100 --> 04:13.100
I think it would be funnier not to.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.100
Who's next?

04:14.100 --> 04:19.100
Do you have any idea how reputationally damning this is?

04:21.100 --> 04:24.100
Well, there's this guy who calls himself SomeBlackGuy.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.100
His video's entitled,

04:26.100 --> 04:28.100
"'Bill Nye Ruins My Childhood.'"

04:28.100 --> 04:31.100
Oh dear, did the science man hurt your feelings?

04:31.100 --> 04:34.100
But I thought rational people put facts over feelings.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.100
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.100
Bill Nye is now diving into the magical fantasy land

04:39.100 --> 04:41.100
of progressive identity politics,

04:41.100 --> 04:43.100
and he's doing it by, uh, his show,

04:43.100 --> 04:45.100
uh, Bill Nye Saves the World,

04:45.100 --> 04:48.100
and I've only seen bits and pieces of it,

04:48.100 --> 04:51.100
and I-I-I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna watch it all the way through.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.100
Oh, great.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.100
Not only has he not actually seen the show,

04:54.100 --> 04:56.100
just the cherry-picked chunks that ended up on YouTube,

04:56.100 --> 04:58.100
he doesn't even plan on watching it.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.100
Points for honesty, I guess.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.100
For most of the video, he plays clips

05:02.100 --> 05:04.100
from the scant bits he has seen

05:04.100 --> 05:07.100
and pauses them to cut away and try and make a clever riff.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.100
Standard cutaway commentary stuff.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.100
But it's actually a lot sexier than that.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.100
I don't know about you guys,

05:13.100 --> 05:16.100
but there's absolutely nothing sexy about this whatsoever.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.100
Heh.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.100
Bill said it was sexy for a joke,

05:19.100 --> 05:22.100
and the audience laughed along because it was a joke,

05:22.100 --> 05:25.100
but Derek says it isn't very sexy at all.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.100
Oh, my God, he's got him.

05:27.100 --> 05:30.100
He's owning him online with discourse.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.100
Can you feel the logic and reason yet?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.100
And then for the rest of the video,

05:34.100 --> 05:37.100
he extemporizes about the horrifying state of the world

05:37.100 --> 05:40.100
now that some people identify as non-binary.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.100
And now you have a bunch of people that,

05:42.100 --> 05:43.100
that just wanna be heard.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.100
They want, they don't wanna be normal.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.100
They wanna, they wanna live in this fantasy world

05:47.100 --> 05:49.100
where there's all these different options and shit.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.100
Oh, no!

05:51.100 --> 05:54.100
People want to have options now.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.100
Like, you're starting to see on, on websites

05:57.100 --> 05:59.100
where they have multiple options for gender

05:59.100 --> 06:01.100
where it was just always man or woman.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.100
Now there's like, oh, fuck that.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.100
No, I'm, no.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.100
Non-binary or something else should be an option.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
I'm like, why?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.100
It's not that fucking serious, dude.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.100
I mean, I know to a lot of people it is,

06:12.100 --> 06:16.100
but in, in, in, in the, in the grand scale of things,

06:16.100 --> 06:18.100
this is extremely trivial.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.100
I agree, it is extremely trivial.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.100
When someone comes up to me and says,

06:21.100 --> 06:24.100
I'd rather you refer to me by these pronouns from now on.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.100
I say, yeah, all right,

06:26.100 --> 06:28.100
because it's really not that hard,

06:28.100 --> 06:31.100
and it doesn't really affect my life all that much.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.100
Oh, no, sorry, you meant the other kind of trivial.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.100
The kind where you spend days of your life

06:36.100 --> 06:39.100
recording YouTube videos, complaining about it

06:39.100 --> 06:42.100
while insisting that it's trivial.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.100
Sure.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
I asked for a little help with that,

06:44.100 --> 06:46.100
and who better to talk about sex

06:46.100 --> 06:50.100
than two...sexy...

06:50.100 --> 06:54.100
two...cis-male white guys?

06:54.100 --> 06:56.100
This dude has fallen off the deep end.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.100
Why couldn't these people,

06:58.100 --> 07:00.100
why couldn't Bill Nye or anybody,

07:00.100 --> 07:02.100
any cis white man,

07:02.100 --> 07:04.100
or just a, a cis male for, for,

07:04.100 --> 07:06.100
talk about this type of stuff?

07:06.100 --> 07:08.100
Like, why is this even mentioned?

07:08.100 --> 07:10.100
Why would you say that?

07:10.100 --> 07:12.100
It, it, like, how is that even funny?

07:12.100 --> 07:14.100
My favorite part of this clip is that he realizes

07:14.100 --> 07:17.100
at the very end, asking these dumbass questions

07:17.100 --> 07:19.100
about why would you dare say that,

07:19.100 --> 07:20.100
that Bill was just making a joke,

07:20.100 --> 07:22.100
so he suddenly cuts himself off and goes,

07:22.100 --> 07:24.100
how is that even funny?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.100
Like, you can see the moment he realizes

07:26.100 --> 07:28.100
that maybe Bill Nye's sentence

07:28.100 --> 07:30.100
shouldn't be taken literally seriously,

07:30.100 --> 07:32.100
but he can't admit he fucked up,

07:32.100 --> 07:33.100
so he just cuts himself off and goes,

07:33.100 --> 07:35.100
well, I wasn't funny either.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.100
Nye wasn't saying that cis male white guys

07:37.100 --> 07:39.100
aren't allowed to talk about sex,

07:39.100 --> 07:40.100
because they are.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.100
They continue to do so after making the joke.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.100
I'm really surprised by how easily

07:45.100 --> 07:47.100
these folks are tripped by jokes.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.100
Now, I could just systematically own Derek

07:49.100 --> 07:51.100
for all the stupid shit he says

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
over the course of the video,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
but I've set myself the lofty goal

07:54.100 --> 07:55.100
of cutting through the chaff

07:55.100 --> 07:57.100
and analyzing the core claims themselves

07:57.100 --> 07:59.100
that appear to be holding up the rest of the rants

07:59.100 --> 08:02.100
and seeing if at least they hold water.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
You know, all this bullshit is bullshit,

08:03.100 --> 08:05.100
but he might have a point in there somewhere,

08:05.100 --> 08:08.100
so I did some digging and found Derek's central claim,

08:08.100 --> 08:10.100
which is that Bill Nye has gone against the science,

08:10.100 --> 08:12.100
and he knows this is what's happened

08:12.100 --> 08:14.100
because real scientists used to say otherwise.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.100
But now he wants to play make-believe

08:16.100 --> 08:17.100
and say stuff like,

08:17.100 --> 08:20.100
oh, gender is on a spectrum like sex, you know?

08:20.100 --> 08:23.100
There's such a thing as, like, non-binary

08:23.100 --> 08:25.100
and stuff like that when, you know,

08:25.100 --> 08:27.100
before, like, any other science, uh,

08:27.100 --> 08:28.100
or scientist that has come before him

08:28.100 --> 08:30.100
has just said there's two genders

08:30.100 --> 08:32.100
and they're determined by the chromosomes.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.100
Chromosomes?

08:33.100 --> 08:34.100
Whatever, he probably misspoke.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.100
He doesn't provide any data or studies

08:36.100 --> 08:39.100
to support the idea that gender is determined by chromosomes,

08:39.100 --> 08:41.100
but he also doesn't even dare say that himself.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.100
Instead, he says,

08:42.100 --> 08:44.100
well, scientists say it,

08:44.100 --> 08:46.100
and he believes those scientists over Bill

08:46.100 --> 08:49.100
because, well, they say what he thinks is true.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.100
Certainly not because he's seen the evidence himself

08:51.100 --> 08:53.100
because then he'd have bothered to show it to the viewer

08:53.100 --> 08:54.100
and not hide behind,

08:54.100 --> 08:56.100
scientists say it, wouldn't he?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.100
The funny thing is he tries and fails

08:58.100 --> 09:00.100
to claim that this is what Bill used to say.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.100
This next clip is unintentionally amazing.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.100
Something that he said himself as well.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.100
In an act of utter hilarity,

09:07.100 --> 09:10.100
after saying this used to be what Bill said himself,

09:10.100 --> 09:13.100
he cuts to a scene from an old episode of Science Guy

09:13.100 --> 09:16.100
where someone who is definitely not Bill himself

09:16.100 --> 09:18.100
explains chromosomes.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.100
Before you're born,

09:19.100 --> 09:21.100
your mom gives you one of her chromosomes

09:21.100 --> 09:23.100
and your dad gives you one of his.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.100
Now, we're gonna investigate that claim

09:24.100 --> 09:26.100
in a little more detail in a sec,

09:26.100 --> 09:30.100
but first, let's stop and think like video editors for a bit.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.100
Look, it's my one actual area of expertise.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.100
I was gonna shoehorn this bit in somewhere.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.100
I'm going to be charitable here

09:35.100 --> 09:39.100
and assume that Derek did some research in advance.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.100
He probably at least watched some of the clips

09:41.100 --> 09:43.100
from the ice cream bit or the musical bit

09:43.100 --> 09:45.100
that people were spreading on YouTube

09:45.100 --> 09:46.100
and saw people claiming on Twitter

09:46.100 --> 09:49.100
that Nye used to say genders caused by chromosomes

09:49.100 --> 09:52.100
and then hit record assuming Bill had actually said it.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
Now, the question is,

09:53.100 --> 09:56.100
why would he think Bill had actually said it himself

09:56.100 --> 09:57.100
in the first place?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.100
He must have got this idea from somewhere.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.100
Well, in the spheres Derek runs in,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.100
a very popular image was circulating on Twitter

10:03.100 --> 10:06.100
with a picture of Bill holding up a diagram of chromosomes

10:06.100 --> 10:08.100
with subtitles claiming they decide a person's gender.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.100
These subtitles were fake.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.100
Nye said nothing of the sort in that actual segment.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.100
The image was spread by noted bastion of truth

10:15.100 --> 10:17.100
and ant enthusiast Ian Miles Chong

10:17.100 --> 10:19.100
in the hopes of convincing gullible idiots,

10:19.100 --> 10:21.100
and, well, evidently it did.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.100
It appears that Derek here took it for granted

10:23.100 --> 10:25.100
that that was what Bill had said

10:25.100 --> 10:27.100
and didn't even check it was true until after recording,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.100
so he had to use this clip of someone else

10:29.100 --> 10:31.100
saying something that you could twist

10:31.100 --> 10:33.100
to be about gender instead.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
Now, I'm just spitballing here.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.100
There's no way of proving that's the exact chain of events.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.100
Uh, Derek could have just missed

10:40.100 --> 10:42.100
the widely shared lie

10:42.100 --> 10:44.100
tweeted by Chong,

10:44.100 --> 10:46.100
who he follows on Twitter,

10:46.100 --> 10:48.100
and which was originally tweeted

10:48.100 --> 10:51.100
just minutes before Derek tweeted,

10:51.100 --> 10:53.100
why is Bill Nye all over my feed?

10:53.100 --> 10:55.100
You know, it could have been a different chain of events,

10:55.100 --> 10:57.100
but it wasn't.

10:57.100 --> 11:00.100
Now, I'm not saying Derek saw a fake screenshot

11:00.100 --> 11:02.100
and took it as fact without checking

11:02.100 --> 11:04.100
and that this is antithetical to the very principles

11:04.100 --> 11:06.100
he claims Bill Nye has abandoned,

11:06.100 --> 11:09.100
but it certainly looks exactly like that.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
However, let's ignore this blatant ignorance

11:11.100 --> 11:13.100
and hypocrisy and talk a little about the segment

11:13.100 --> 11:15.100
he did end up using, featuring someone

11:15.100 --> 11:18.100
who isn't Bill Nye talking about chromosomes.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.100
This clip is also widely used elsewhere

11:20.100 --> 11:22.100
to claim Nye's previous show was right

11:22.100 --> 11:24.100
and then he got infected by feminism or something.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.100
Derek contrasts this old clip from 1996

11:27.100 --> 11:29.100
with his present stance on the issue in his new show.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.100
Many months later...

11:31.100 --> 11:33.100
I used to think there were just two settings,

11:33.100 --> 11:35.100
male and female.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.100
At least you actually had a clip of Bill talking

11:37.100 --> 11:39.100
about the issue this time, Derek.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.100
The implication, of course, is that Nye has abandoned

11:41.100 --> 11:43.100
the science and become a liar,

11:43.100 --> 11:45.100
but this reflects a very poor understanding

11:45.100 --> 11:47.100
of the absolute basics of Bill Nye's old show

11:47.100 --> 11:49.100
and how it was constructed primarily

11:49.100 --> 11:52.100
to give children a baseline understanding

11:52.100 --> 11:54.100
of science in the 90s.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.100
The old show, I hate to point out,

11:56.100 --> 11:58.100
never really did cover sex, gender,

11:58.100 --> 12:01.100
or sexuality in much detail, if at all.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
Covering these issues on a show for kids in the 90s

12:03.100 --> 12:05.100
was pretty much off-limits.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.100
You'd come under fire for indoctrinating children

12:07.100 --> 12:09.100
into an evil agenda and other gay panic nonsense

12:09.100 --> 12:11.100
bullshit garbage.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
You know, the sort of thing similar

12:13.100 --> 12:15.100
Neo-Puritans would do in the modern day

12:15.100 --> 12:17.100
if, let's say,

12:17.100 --> 12:19.100
there was a YouTube channel aimed at educating kids

12:19.100 --> 12:21.100
about these issues.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.100
I wonder why the producers wanted to avoid

12:23.100 --> 12:25.100
the ire of Derek's ideological predecessors

12:25.100 --> 12:27.100
and risk getting pulled from the air

12:27.100 --> 12:29.100
or sent death threats.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.100
They steered well clear and, to my knowledge,

12:31.100 --> 12:33.100
only ever barely broached the subject

12:33.100 --> 12:35.100
of sex differences when it's in relation

12:35.100 --> 12:36.100
to something else.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.100
The segment all the idiots are pointing to

12:38.100 --> 12:40.100
is from an episode about probability.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.100
No, not sex.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.100
Not here's an episode on how chromosomes work.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.100
Probability.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.100
Imagine for a moment that you're one of the writers of this show.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.100
Let's say you're writing an episode of a science show

12:50.100 --> 12:52.100
about probability,

12:52.100 --> 12:54.100
and you have 23 minutes to explain it to an audience,

12:54.100 --> 12:56.100
and an example you want to give

12:56.100 --> 12:58.100
is the probability of which sex you were born.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.100
And if Dad gives you an X2,

13:00.100 --> 13:02.100
then you become a girl.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.100
But if he gives you his Y,

13:04.100 --> 13:06.100
then you become a boy.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.100
Even though, because you know your stuff,

13:08.100 --> 13:10.100
because you're a researcher for a show about science,

13:10.100 --> 13:12.100
the science behind transgender people is known to you,

13:12.100 --> 13:14.100
you're writing in an era where,

13:14.100 --> 13:16.100
generally speaking, the terms

13:16.100 --> 13:18.100
sex and gender are conflated in common parlance.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.100
And you're writing a show for kids.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.100
In fact, you're writing lines for an actual

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
kid to say, so you have her say,

13:24.100 --> 13:26.100
if you have a Y chromosome, you're a boy

13:26.100 --> 13:28.100
for convenience's sake.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
You also wrote a funny skit where Bill picks the wrong door

13:30.100 --> 13:32.100
to his lab and falls off the roof of a building.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.100
Huh? Oh, oh, oh, oh!

13:34.100 --> 13:36.100
Oh, boy.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.100
See, there are only two possibilities.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.100
You know, as a writer for the show,

13:40.100 --> 13:42.100
that there's a probability of a person

13:42.100 --> 13:44.100
being intersex or other rare

13:44.100 --> 13:46.100
chromosomal differences that complicate this simple

13:46.100 --> 13:48.100
one and two probability.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.100
But you know that taking the time to explain this here

13:50.100 --> 13:52.100
would mean cutting into the Wizard of Odds skit

13:52.100 --> 13:54.100
where you reenact the Wizard of Oz

13:54.100 --> 13:56.100
and Bill Nye is the Wizard.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.100
If you want to improve the chances of getting home safely,

13:58.100 --> 14:00.100
wear a seatbelt.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.100
The chance of becoming either a boy or a girl

14:02.100 --> 14:04.100
is always one in two.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.100
A 50-50 chance either way.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.100
It's like flipping a coin.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.100
Mm-hmm.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.100
X, you're a girl. Y, you're a boy.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.100
You also, because you're not an idiot,

14:14.100 --> 14:16.100
have done more than five seconds of research

14:16.100 --> 14:18.100
and know that the probability in most industrialized

14:18.100 --> 14:20.100
nations of being born physically male

14:20.100 --> 14:22.100
is generally higher than being born

14:22.100 --> 14:24.100
physically female, so the chances are more like

14:24.100 --> 14:26.100
1.05 in two, meaning

14:26.100 --> 14:28.100
it's not like flipping a coin so much as like

14:28.100 --> 14:30.100
flipping a coin that's very slightly weighted

14:30.100 --> 14:32.100
as a result of complex environmental factors.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.100
And there's also the rare but real

14:34.100 --> 14:36.100
possibility of the coin landing on its side.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.100
You don't bring this up either, because Bill

14:38.100 --> 14:40.100
really doesn't want to cut the skit where he counts

14:40.100 --> 14:42.100
dice possibilities next to the giant fan

14:42.100 --> 14:44.100
he stole from the set of Blade Runner.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.100
And since the video is boiling down probabilities

14:46.100 --> 14:48.100
for children, you leave it out,

14:48.100 --> 14:50.100
hoping people more discerning of the science

14:50.100 --> 14:52.100
will understand why you left it out,

14:52.100 --> 14:54.100
and privately, you pray that none of the

14:54.100 --> 14:56.100
kids in the audience will grow up to call Bill Nye

14:56.100 --> 14:58.100
a liar when he explains the more complicated

14:58.100 --> 15:00.100
version to them as adults.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.100
Does he cite any sources to back up his claims

15:02.100 --> 15:04.100
throughout the video? Why,

15:04.100 --> 15:06.100
some black guy gives an exhaustingly

15:06.100 --> 15:08.100
comprehensive list of his merch store,

15:08.100 --> 15:10.100
Patreon, PayPal,

15:10.100 --> 15:12.100
Second Channel, Twitch,

15:12.100 --> 15:14.100
Instagram, Ask.FM, Snapchat,

15:14.100 --> 15:16.100
email, Grindr,

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
Chimney, Splango,

15:18.100 --> 15:20.100
et cetera, et cetera.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.100
Unfortunately, he doesn't cite any

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
sources because he doesn't have any to

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
back up his beliefs, but he feels

15:26.100 --> 15:28.100
very strongly that he's right, and that's why

15:28.100 --> 15:30.100
you should check out the t-shirts for sale in his

15:30.100 --> 15:32.100
merch store. For example, this one about

15:32.100 --> 15:34.100
how facts are more important than feelings.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.100
And he's right. In making an

15:36.100 --> 15:38.100
informed argument, facts are

15:38.100 --> 15:40.100
important. Would have been

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
great if he'd had any, wouldn't it?

15:42.100 --> 15:44.100
Some black guy, more like

15:44.100 --> 15:46.100
some lack of evidence

15:46.100 --> 15:48.100
got, oh, cut that

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
out. That's just rubbish.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
I hope you're sick

15:52.100 --> 15:54.100
of bullshit because here's YouTuber

15:54.100 --> 15:56.100
No Bullshit with his video entitled

15:56.100 --> 15:58.100
Bill Nye Goes Full SJW

15:58.100 --> 16:00.100
Trashes Whites

16:00.100 --> 16:02.100
Praises Transgenders and Gays

16:02.100 --> 16:04.100
and by no bullshit, I

16:04.100 --> 16:06.100
apparently meant to say no sources.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.100
I bet we're in for a real science

16:08.100 --> 16:10.100
and research fest here.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.100
...

16:12.100 --> 16:14.100
...

16:14.100 --> 16:16.100
...

16:16.100 --> 16:18.100
I'm sick of people over

16:18.100 --> 16:20.100
inflating the amounts of gay and transgender

16:20.100 --> 16:22.100
people in the population, and I have nothing

16:22.100 --> 16:24.100
against the people, don't get me wrong.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.100
I'm just sick of this overly gay, overly

16:26.100 --> 16:28.100
pro-trans narrative being pushed

16:28.100 --> 16:30.100
everywhere. Everywhere that toes the line with

16:30.100 --> 16:32.100
the liberal SJW PC

16:32.100 --> 16:34.100
crowd. It's gotten beyond annoying and

16:34.100 --> 16:36.100
is verging into unsettling and disturbing

16:36.100 --> 16:38.100
places. When I clicked a video

16:38.100 --> 16:40.100
by someone called No Bullshit, I thought

16:40.100 --> 16:42.100
I was entering an intellectual thunderdome.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.100
But so far, all he's done is

16:44.100 --> 16:46.100
complain about the overly

16:46.100 --> 16:48.100
gay, overly pro-trans

16:48.100 --> 16:50.100
narrative that's being pushed

16:50.100 --> 16:52.100
everywhere by the liberals. I thought

16:52.100 --> 16:54.100
this was supposed to be about science,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.100
but this guy's just sharing his feelings

16:56.100 --> 16:58.100
about the liberals.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.100
What is this? No Bullshit's whole deal

17:00.100 --> 17:02.100
appears to be to pause during whatever

17:02.100 --> 17:04.100
he's watching partway through to fantasize

17:04.100 --> 17:06.100
about the deep, hidden

17:06.100 --> 17:08.100
emotions or the evil agendas

17:08.100 --> 17:10.100
of the people on screen.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.100
God,

17:12.100 --> 17:14.100
even the new theme song is shittier.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.100
And it just screams, I'm desperate to be

17:16.100 --> 17:18.100
cool and hip again. Here's a black guy singing

17:18.100 --> 17:20.100
my theme song. I'm down.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.100
Now either Mr. Bullshit, if that is his real

17:22.100 --> 17:24.100
name, which I'm going to assume it is,

17:24.100 --> 17:26.100
can read minds, or he's just written

17:26.100 --> 17:28.100
an elaborate fanfiction about

17:28.100 --> 17:30.100
Bill Nye wanting to look

17:30.100 --> 17:32.100
hip, so he personally gets

17:32.100 --> 17:34.100
Tyler, the creator, to make the new theme.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.100
Because apparently no one else

17:36.100 --> 17:38.100
is involved with the production of a show.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.100
The man the camera's appointed at,

17:40.100 --> 17:42.100
he personally writes it all.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.100
He commissions everything that goes into the show.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.100
He personally hires all the animators.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
It's all Bill Nye. It's not like

17:48.100 --> 17:50.100
there's a production crew or anything.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.100
Who better to talk about sex than two

17:52.100 --> 17:54.100
cis-male

17:54.100 --> 17:56.100
white guys?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.100
And this is also where

17:58.100 --> 18:00.100
I lose all hope for the show.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.100
Anyone who uses the word cis is either an

18:02.100 --> 18:04.100
MW whack job, or they're someone who's trying

18:04.100 --> 18:06.100
to pander to them. If you hear someone say a

18:06.100 --> 18:08.100
word you don't like, pause the video to

18:08.100 --> 18:10.100
complain about how that makes them the bad

18:10.100 --> 18:12.100
people. Bonus points if you

18:12.100 --> 18:14.100
then go on to make videos complaining about how

18:14.100 --> 18:16.100
everyone else is easily offended by words.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.100
They pull it off with

18:18.100 --> 18:20.100
so much confidence that it doesn't

18:20.100 --> 18:22.100
feel weird, it just feels like, hey.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.100
So now we jump to Veritasium on location

18:24.100 --> 18:26.100
in Korea. And to be honest, listening

18:26.100 --> 18:28.100
to this K-pop weirdo talk,

18:28.100 --> 18:30.100
I feel the same way Veritasium looks.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.100
He looks squinty. He's looking

18:32.100 --> 18:34.100
down on this creeper, raising his upper lip

18:34.100 --> 18:36.100
in disgust. He looks

18:36.100 --> 18:38.100
squinty, and that means he's

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
looking down on the person he's interviewing.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.100
He secretly hates them.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.100
This Rachel Bloom bitch sounds like she's

18:44.100 --> 18:46.100
trying to be the next Amy Schumer or something.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.100
My vagina. My vagina.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.100
No one cares about your gross vagina,

18:50.100 --> 18:52.100
lady. I'm not gonna even touch those

18:52.100 --> 18:54.100
frankly Freudian comments

18:54.100 --> 18:56.100
about finding vaginas weird.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.100
Now as can be plainly seen, this

18:58.100 --> 19:00.100
no-bullshit fellow doesn't really have any

19:00.100 --> 19:02.100
understanding of the science and isn't all that bright

19:02.100 --> 19:04.100
otherwise. So he doesn't even really

19:04.100 --> 19:06.100
understand why he's so angry

19:06.100 --> 19:08.100
that the show is too

19:08.100 --> 19:10.100
pro-gay. So he wallpapers

19:10.100 --> 19:12.100
over the cracks in his own understanding

19:12.100 --> 19:14.100
by imagining that everyone

19:14.100 --> 19:16.100
on screen is sad and

19:16.100 --> 19:18.100
angry and hateful and wants to

19:18.100 --> 19:20.100
look cool and is pushing an agenda

19:20.100 --> 19:22.100
and is an evil liberal

19:22.100 --> 19:24.100
and wants to be like Amy Schumer.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.100
Which doesn't really make any sense.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.100
No one wants to be like Amy Schumer.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.100
Not even Amy Schumer wants to be like Amy Schumer.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.100
Now, if I

19:32.100 --> 19:34.100
really wanted to, I could go

19:34.100 --> 19:36.100
through the entire video and make one of my

19:36.100 --> 19:38.100
patented, citation-needed

19:38.100 --> 19:40.100
jokes every single time he makes

19:40.100 --> 19:42.100
a claim and then doesn't support it with any

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100
evidence whatsoever. This still doesn't

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
change the fact that there are only two genders.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

19:48.100 --> 19:50.100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

19:50.100 --> 19:52.100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

19:52.100 --> 19:54.100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

19:54.100 --> 19:56.100
and just imagine that he likes the smell of his own

19:56.100 --> 19:58.100
farts and then move on without thinking about him too much.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.100
Ugh, we're running out of people

20:02.100 --> 20:04.100
pretending they have compelling arguments.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.100
Quick! What about Previous Appearance Have a

20:06.100 --> 20:08.100
Red Pill Philosophy? The guy who couldn't even

20:08.100 --> 20:10.100
remember the names of the main characters of

20:10.100 --> 20:12.100
The Force Awakens in the car after getting out

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
of the theater? Maybe his video

20:14.100 --> 20:16.100
Bill Nye's Netflix Show

20:16.100 --> 20:18.100
Trashes White People, Glorifies

20:18.100 --> 20:20.100
Transge-

20:20.100 --> 20:22.100
Wait, haven't we seen that title before?

20:22.100 --> 20:24.100
So it's like a game. You guys are

20:24.100 --> 20:26.100
writing the same thing. I love that clip.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.100
It's from Roosh complaining to some journalists

20:28.100 --> 20:30.100
accusing them of secretly plotting to push

20:30.100 --> 20:32.100
a unified narrative by writing

20:32.100 --> 20:34.100
similar articles, as if there's a multitude

20:34.100 --> 20:36.100
of ways of reporting about his legalized

20:36.100 --> 20:38.100
rape article, but I like reusing

20:38.100 --> 20:40.100
it in a better context of people in his

20:40.100 --> 20:42.100
sphere copying each other's work.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.100
I can't wait for them to start suing each other.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.100
Those court cases are gonna be hilarious.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
But speaking of doing the same thing, at this point, I'm

20:48.100 --> 20:50.100
starting to see a lot of repeat performances

20:50.100 --> 20:52.100
of people plotting out the same arguments again and again

20:52.100 --> 20:54.100
in new, even more uninformed

20:54.100 --> 20:56.100
incarnations. We've got the

20:56.100 --> 20:58.100
lecturing the white race argument.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.100
Some Indian dude came on

21:00.100 --> 21:02.100
to Bill Nye's show

21:02.100 --> 21:04.100
to lecture white people about cultural

21:04.100 --> 21:06.100
appropriation! Prashant's

21:06.100 --> 21:08.100
lectured the entire

21:08.100 --> 21:10.100
white race on how it's unacceptable

21:10.100 --> 21:12.100
to use Asian mysticism

21:12.100 --> 21:14.100
because it's from a different culture.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.100
You've got complaints that it's too political

21:16.100 --> 21:18.100
to even talk about this stuff, or

21:18.100 --> 21:20.100
outright fantasies of a secret liberal

21:20.100 --> 21:22.100
agenda. Pushing leftist

21:22.100 --> 21:24.100
liberal SJW narratives.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.100
This episode is very clearly

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
politically driven. Oh, it's-it's-it's politics,

21:28.100 --> 21:30.100
like, bringing the politics

21:30.100 --> 21:32.100
into the science. And we've got the same sob

21:32.100 --> 21:34.100
stories about how he used to like Bill, but

21:34.100 --> 21:36.100
then he betrayed me! Bill Nye

21:36.100 --> 21:38.100
is a childhood hero to a lot of people,

21:38.100 --> 21:40.100
including myself. His television show

21:40.100 --> 21:42.100
Bill Nye the Science Guy was informative,

21:42.100 --> 21:44.100
innovative, and entertaining.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.100
I was extremely excited

21:46.100 --> 21:48.100
when Netflix announced that they'd be releasing

21:48.100 --> 21:50.100
a brand new Bill Nye series.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.100
You used to be a voice

21:52.100 --> 21:54.100
for hard science.

21:54.100 --> 21:56.100
When I was a child,

21:56.100 --> 21:58.100
you were just this cool figure

21:58.100 --> 22:00.100
for science. You are a representative

22:00.100 --> 22:02.100
of science, and you just

22:02.100 --> 22:04.100
shit over all of it! And of course

22:04.100 --> 22:06.100
we've got the fantastic repeat performance

22:06.100 --> 22:08.100
of not bothering to cite any sources or studies

22:08.100 --> 22:10.100
to back up any of their claims.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.100
At this point, my mind's a blur.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.100
I can't honestly tell you what Red Pill Philosophy

22:14.100 --> 22:16.100
said in his video, and the first time

22:16.100 --> 22:18.100
I watched it, I wasn't sure if I'd somehow seen

22:18.100 --> 22:20.100
it before and forgotten. I tried to re-watch

22:20.100 --> 22:22.100
it and see if he says anything worth specifically

22:22.100 --> 22:24.100
debunking, but my eyes just

22:24.100 --> 22:26.100
slide off him and I start to think about

22:26.100 --> 22:28.100
all the vacuuming I could be doing.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.100
Bill Nye, the establishment guy,

22:32.100 --> 22:34.100
is nothing but an establishment

22:34.100 --> 22:36.100
shill, nothing but

22:36.100 --> 22:38.100
establishment propaganda. If you go

22:38.100 --> 22:40.100
to the Twitter page of that March for

22:40.100 --> 22:42.100
Science, uh, Twitter page,

22:42.100 --> 22:44.100
it's at establishment propaganda.

22:44.100 --> 22:46.100
Bill Nye, the propaganda

22:46.100 --> 22:48.100
guy. Bill Nye, the

22:48.100 --> 22:50.100
establishment guy.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.100
Um, so Bill Nye, the propaganda guy.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.100
Bill Nye, the establishment shill guy.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.100
At this point in my

22:56.100 --> 22:58.100
quest, I was desperate for someone,

22:58.100 --> 23:00.100
anyone who had something different

23:00.100 --> 23:02.100
to say. It didn't even have to be right.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.100
At this point, a different set of wrong

23:04.100 --> 23:06.100
arguments would have been enough to make me feel

23:06.100 --> 23:08.100
alive again, and then

23:08.100 --> 23:10.100
out of the darkness came

23:10.100 --> 23:12.100
Rage After Storm. Rage After Storm

23:12.100 --> 23:14.100
is one of those YouTubers who

23:14.100 --> 23:16.100
actively courts a far-right audience

23:16.100 --> 23:18.100
and likes to talk about how race is real

23:18.100 --> 23:20.100
and tweet about how Hitler had

23:20.100 --> 23:22.100
some really good ideas. This video

23:22.100 --> 23:24.100
is entitled Bill Nye, the

23:24.100 --> 23:26.100
Jewish guy.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.100
Please stop getting triggered over the Jew thing.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.100
It's a reference to the nose.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.100
It was just banter.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.100
The video opens a little familiarly to begin with,

23:34.100 --> 23:36.100
with the standard totally not-fabricated

23:36.100 --> 23:38.100
Bill Nye sob story. I loved

23:38.100 --> 23:40.100
him, and it made me want to think about stuff,

23:40.100 --> 23:42.100
but then he said the bad thing. Look, I know

23:42.100 --> 23:44.100
that so many people are starting to catch this

23:44.100 --> 23:46.100
SJW virus,

23:46.100 --> 23:48.100
but I never knew that it would be my

23:48.100 --> 23:50.100
dearest Bill. I respected

23:50.100 --> 23:52.100
him so much. No, really, he was

23:52.100 --> 23:54.100
my muse.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.100
But then she goes off the fucking chain.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.100
She one-ups Armored Skeptic's

23:58.100 --> 24:00.100
ice cream slut shaming and begins trying

24:00.100 --> 24:02.100
to figure out which sexualities the ice

24:02.100 --> 24:04.100
creams represent in the comedy

24:04.100 --> 24:06.100
ice cream cartoon. You have

24:06.100 --> 24:08.100
vanilla, that's straight. One of the flavours then has to

24:08.100 --> 24:10.100
be a lesbian. One of them has to be gay.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.100
One of them has to be bisexual. Okay,

24:12.100 --> 24:14.100
someone over here is a fucked

24:14.100 --> 24:16.100
up ice cream. She's trying to fucking

24:16.100 --> 24:18.100
diagnose cartoon ice creams.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.100
Which sexuality are you?

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
Let me get out my ice cream, Speculum.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.100
Hey, mint chocolate chip!

24:24.100 --> 24:26.100
Sorry I'm late. I was

24:26.100 --> 24:28.100
busy being two awesome things at once.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.100
Okay, nope. Choco chip is

24:30.100 --> 24:32.100
obviously bisexual. This is weird.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.100
Actually, chocolate chip is pretty

24:34.100 --> 24:36.100
straightforwardly a metaphor for non-binary

24:36.100 --> 24:38.100
or intersex people. You know,

24:38.100 --> 24:40.100
being two awesome things

24:40.100 --> 24:42.100
at once. Not enjoys licking

24:42.100 --> 24:44.100
two different kinds of ice cream

24:44.100 --> 24:46.100
at once. She can't even

24:46.100 --> 24:48.100
pass the most basic point of the segment.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.100
You're nuts.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.100
Can we not encourage

24:52.100 --> 24:54.100
gangbangs, please? Can we teach people

24:54.100 --> 24:56.100
a bit of decency? Having a gangbang

24:56.100 --> 24:58.100
is not something to be proud of.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.100
Well, someone isn't invited to my

25:00.100 --> 25:02.100
next house party, I can tell you.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.100
Not because of that, though. Because of

25:04.100 --> 25:06.100
the Hitler apologetics.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.100
Again, this is exactly how STDs

25:08.100 --> 25:10.100
spread. Being slutty is

25:10.100 --> 25:12.100
not cool. No, being uneducated

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
about STDs and how they spread

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
is how they spread. Imagine that.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.100
The real problem being

25:18.100 --> 25:20.100
people being uneducated

25:20.100 --> 25:22.100
on the issue. Imagine if that

25:22.100 --> 25:24.100
was the real problem here.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.100
So she continues to moral panic about how

25:26.100 --> 25:28.100
the show is promoting being bi as cool

25:28.100 --> 25:30.100
too much and how it's tricking people into

25:30.100 --> 25:32.100
wanting to be bi, to be trendy. You know,

25:32.100 --> 25:34.100
because that's how sexuality works.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.100
Just in general, why are we advertising the fact

25:36.100 --> 25:38.100
that bisexuality is cool?

25:38.100 --> 25:40.100
This isn't a particularly uncommon approach

25:40.100 --> 25:42.100
to sexuality either. You see it everywhere

25:42.100 --> 25:44.100
in conservative criticism of progressive media.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.100
Like with No Bullshit, the problem

25:46.100 --> 25:48.100
isn't that LGBT people exist. Of course

25:48.100 --> 25:50.100
not. They love gay people.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.100
The problem is the overly

25:52.100 --> 25:54.100
pro-LGBT narrative.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.100
From their perspective, the issue

25:56.100 --> 25:58.100
is people being too nice

25:58.100 --> 26:00.100
about the bis, the

26:00.100 --> 26:02.100
gyars, the lesbs

26:02.100 --> 26:04.100
and the transes. And that

26:04.100 --> 26:06.100
throws off the delicate balance

26:06.100 --> 26:08.100
of nature or something.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.100
They think these people are allowed to exist

26:10.100 --> 26:12.100
and that's fine, that's okay. We've finally gotten

26:12.100 --> 26:14.100
them that far. But

26:14.100 --> 26:16.100
they have to exist in the background somewhere.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.100
You can't accidentally make it look like

26:18.100 --> 26:20.100
it's okay to be like that.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.100
Because that's basically just pushing

26:22.100 --> 26:24.100
their agenda on people.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.100
None of it is meant to be like a fashion

26:26.100 --> 26:28.100
craze or a trend or something that's cool.

26:28.100 --> 26:30.100
Okay? It's not. This

26:30.100 --> 26:32.100
provides people with pressure.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.100
Pressuring people into becoming bi

26:34.100 --> 26:36.100
and having orgies? Is that

26:36.100 --> 26:38.100
really what the cartoon ice cream

26:38.100 --> 26:40.100
skit does to people?

26:40.100 --> 26:42.100
This might just be my opinion, but I don't think many

26:42.100 --> 26:44.100
people are going to have their sexuality changed

26:44.100 --> 26:46.100
or their identity radically

26:46.100 --> 26:48.100
altered by media

26:48.100 --> 26:50.100
presenting it as okay to not

26:50.100 --> 26:52.100
be straight or not be, I'm

26:52.100 --> 26:54.100
going to say the bad word, cover your ears,

26:54.100 --> 26:56.100
cisgendered. I'm at the risk

26:56.100 --> 26:58.100
of sounding a little bit stubborn here, but I just

26:58.100 --> 27:00.100
don't accept that people who are

27:00.100 --> 27:02.100
secure in their own sexuality are going to have theirs

27:02.100 --> 27:04.100
changed by other people being open

27:04.100 --> 27:06.100
about their own. Which is why my conscience

27:06.100 --> 27:08.100
will be clear when, at the end of this sentence,

27:08.100 --> 27:10.100
I cut to a graphic depiction

27:10.100 --> 27:12.100
of what I get up to in my bed every

27:12.100 --> 27:14.100
single night.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.100
I'm playing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.100
You can play it anywhere because it's

27:18.100 --> 27:20.100
portable. It's a really good game,

27:20.100 --> 27:22.100
guys. But don't get me wrong. That doesn't

27:22.100 --> 27:24.100
mean that there aren't very positive effects

27:24.100 --> 27:26.100
of having good representations

27:26.100 --> 27:28.100
of LGBT people in media.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.100
This kind of goes without saying, but generally speaking,

27:30.100 --> 27:32.100
it's healthy for a person

27:32.100 --> 27:34.100
to feel like they're allowed to express

27:34.100 --> 27:36.100
themselves and their identity without

27:36.100 --> 27:38.100
fear of not being accepted

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
or of being treated like they're lesser

27:40.100 --> 27:42.100
as a result of it. Perceiving

27:42.100 --> 27:44.100
positive representations of LGBT people

27:44.100 --> 27:46.100
as some kind of insidious

27:46.100 --> 27:48.100
trick is, academically

27:48.100 --> 27:50.100
speaking, very

27:50.100 --> 27:52.100
stupid. Versatile love

27:52.100 --> 27:54.100
may have some butt stuff.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.100
Ew. I think that short clip of someone

27:56.100 --> 27:58.100
saying butt stuff and cutting to her saying

27:58.100 --> 28:00.100
ew sums up her coverage

28:00.100 --> 28:02.100
of most of this episode. She seems to be

28:02.100 --> 28:04.100
aware of how little she has to say, though,

28:04.100 --> 28:06.100
so she quickly moves on to the episode dealing with

28:06.100 --> 28:08.100
overpopulation and carbon footprint and

28:08.100 --> 28:10.100
what to do about it. Someone on the panel

28:10.100 --> 28:12.100
talks about the much lower carbon footprint

28:12.100 --> 28:14.100
of people in a non-Western country

28:14.100 --> 28:16.100
and we get this, well, just

28:16.100 --> 28:18.100
watch. How many does the

28:18.100 --> 28:20.100
average American- I did that with my coffee

28:20.100 --> 28:22.100
this morning. Yeah, 16

28:22.100 --> 28:24.100
metric tons is what the average-

28:24.100 --> 28:26.100
160 times. Yeah, yeah,

28:26.100 --> 28:28.100
exactly. And so our two

28:28.100 --> 28:30.100
kids are way more problematic.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.100
The Nigerians with an average

28:32.100 --> 28:34.100
7 children are not the problem when it comes to

28:34.100 --> 28:36.100
climate change. The reason why they have

28:36.100 --> 28:38.100
so many fucking kids is not because

28:38.100 --> 28:40.100
they care about what's happening

28:40.100 --> 28:42.100
with the environment. I'm pretty sure Botswana

28:42.100 --> 28:44.100
over in Africa is not

28:44.100 --> 28:46.100
popping out kids and thinking, it's okay,

28:46.100 --> 28:48.100
I can have this seventh kid, it's sustainable,

28:48.100 --> 28:50.100
it's okay, I'm not using all this

28:50.100 --> 28:52.100
CO2, I'm not creating greenhouse gases.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.100
No, they have kids

28:54.100 --> 28:56.100
to fuel selfish ways

28:56.100 --> 28:58.100
of getting them to look after them when

28:58.100 --> 29:00.100
they're older. They have kids because they know

29:00.100 --> 29:02.100
that child that they're popping out

29:02.100 --> 29:04.100
right now will probably die from famine,

29:04.100 --> 29:06.100
diseases, or both. Contraception

29:06.100 --> 29:08.100
for them is out of the window anyway, I mean,

29:08.100 --> 29:10.100
they don't even know how to put on a fucking condom.

29:10.100 --> 29:12.100
I mean, can we really trust these people to take

29:12.100 --> 29:14.100
a contraceptive pill every day? Can

29:14.100 --> 29:16.100
we really? The answer is no.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.100
This video took a fucking turn.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.100
She takes the comment about the lower carbon footprint

29:20.100 --> 29:22.100
of people in Western Africa

29:22.100 --> 29:24.100
and just goes off on a rant about how stupid

29:24.100 --> 29:26.100
and bad those people are, how they can't

29:26.100 --> 29:28.100
be trusted to put on a condom.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.100
She doesn't even appear to notice that the image

29:30.100 --> 29:32.100
she's using to stereotype an entire

29:32.100 --> 29:34.100
continent of people is literally

29:34.100 --> 29:36.100
taken from the website

29:36.100 --> 29:38.100
nationalstereotype.com.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.100
So should we have policies that

29:40.100 --> 29:42.100
penalize people for having extra

29:42.100 --> 29:44.100
kids in the developed world?

29:44.100 --> 29:46.100
Um, so I do think that

29:46.100 --> 29:47.100
we should at least consider it.

29:47.100 --> 29:49.100
Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.100
So let's get people in Western countries

29:51.100 --> 29:52.100
to stop.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.100
I'll let this unhinged rant continue

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
but let's just pause for a second and keep in mind

29:56.100 --> 29:58.100
that what the guy actually said was

29:58.100 --> 30:00.100
I think we should at least consider it.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.100
Remember that she's this angry

30:02.100 --> 30:04.100
about a very non-committal

30:04.100 --> 30:06.100
comment about how we should maybe

30:06.100 --> 30:08.100
at least think about it.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.100
Remember that she's angry here

30:10.100 --> 30:12.100
about the idea of

30:12.100 --> 30:14.100
thinking about something.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.100
Let's get people in Western countries

30:16.100 --> 30:18.100
to stop having kids, you know,

30:18.100 --> 30:20.100
the people that are actually solving

30:20.100 --> 30:22.100
the problems with climate change, so then

30:22.100 --> 30:24.100
people in the third world can overpopulate

30:24.100 --> 30:26.100
us.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.100
That's right, Rage After Storm's talking about

30:30.100 --> 30:32.100
the Great Replacement, the easily

30:32.100 --> 30:34.100
debunkable idea that foreigners are going to

30:34.100 --> 30:36.100
take over the West by outbreeding

30:36.100 --> 30:38.100
us because of differences in birth rates.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.100
They were importing these third worlders

30:40.100 --> 30:42.100
into Western countries like Germany

30:42.100 --> 30:44.100
where the population is aging

30:44.100 --> 30:46.100
and on a decline.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.100
They're importing foreigners and they're going to take over.

30:48.100 --> 30:50.100
She even uses the phrase replacement rate.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
If you'd like to know more about this idea

30:52.100 --> 30:54.100
and why it's total bullshit, actual

30:54.100 --> 30:56.100
skepticism user and skull reclaimer

30:56.100 --> 30:58.100
Sean Andjen did a video

30:58.100 --> 31:00.100
debunking it handily. So handily

31:00.100 --> 31:02.100
that it got false flagged and taken down

31:02.100 --> 31:04.100
for a while by idiots because its existence

31:04.100 --> 31:06.100
was inconvenient for them.

31:06.100 --> 31:08.100
Check it out. Rage's version of the Great Replacement

31:08.100 --> 31:10.100
is even less informed and

31:10.100 --> 31:12.100
even more overtly racist than it

31:12.100 --> 31:14.100
normally is. And by saying to the residents

31:14.100 --> 31:16.100
of the third world, oh yeah no

31:16.100 --> 31:18.100
you keep on having kids, you

31:18.100 --> 31:20.100
are basically shooting yourself in the

31:20.100 --> 31:22.100
foot. When I'm out and about

31:22.100 --> 31:24.100
and I see people with loads of kids

31:24.100 --> 31:26.100
it's either people that look like

31:26.100 --> 31:28.100
they dance around wind turbines with hemp

31:28.100 --> 31:30.100
sandals on or

31:30.100 --> 31:32.100
people who aren't really Western Europeans.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.100
She concludes that the solution

31:34.100 --> 31:36.100
is education. And I guarantee you

31:36.100 --> 31:38.100
the way to solve this issue is

31:38.100 --> 31:40.100
by education. I agree.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.100
Some people could certainly do

31:42.100 --> 31:44.100
with knowing a bit more about the issues

31:44.100 --> 31:46.100
before they open their mouth to dog whistle

31:46.100 --> 31:48.100
about being replaced by immigrants.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.100
Mwah, mwah.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.100
Now some people who are watching this video might

31:52.100 --> 31:54.100
genuinely think the Great Replacement is

31:54.100 --> 31:56.100
real or otherwise nod along with

31:56.100 --> 31:58.100
similar scaremongering about immigrants.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.100
And I bet those people feel hard

32:00.100 --> 32:02.100
done by right now. I can imagine that

32:02.100 --> 32:04.100
free speech fan 1488

32:04.100 --> 32:06.100
has already paused the video to go

32:06.100 --> 32:08.100
you didn't actually debunk the Great Replacement

32:08.100 --> 32:10.100
you just made fun of how completely

32:10.100 --> 32:12.100
fucking unhinged it sounds.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.100
She cited a newspaper article

32:14.100 --> 32:16.100
to prove that she's

32:16.100 --> 32:18.100
right. Why didn't you bother

32:18.100 --> 32:20.100
to debunk that? You're ignoring it.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.100
You're afraid of the truth. Well hold your

32:22.100 --> 32:24.100
horses mate. Let's look at that

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
newspaper article in

32:26.100 --> 32:28.100
more detail.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.100
Shall we?

32:30.100 --> 32:32.100
Luckily, to her credit, Rage After Storm

32:32.100 --> 32:34.100
in the interest of transparency

32:34.100 --> 32:36.100
has put a link to all of the sources that she used

32:36.100 --> 32:38.100
in the description of the video

32:38.100 --> 32:40.100
including links to where she got the Bill Nye

32:40.100 --> 32:42.100
clips from, a bunch of newspaper

32:42.100 --> 32:44.100
articles calling Bill Nye a full of shit

32:44.100 --> 32:46.100
baby man who said the bad things

32:46.100 --> 32:48.100
from places like...

32:48.100 --> 32:50.100
The Federalist? Not a publication

32:50.100 --> 32:52.100
I had heard of but that's alright.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.100
Let's just click the link to that source

32:54.100 --> 32:56.100
in the description and...

32:56.100 --> 32:58.100
Oh. Weird.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.100
That link isn't

33:00.100 --> 33:02.100
in the description.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.100
I wonder why.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.100
Instead, I had to find it myself by

33:06.100 --> 33:08.100
googling the title. Oh boy!

33:08.100 --> 33:10.100
It's an article from the Telegraph.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.100
That bastion of accurate political

33:12.100 --> 33:14.100
reporting entitled

33:14.100 --> 33:16.100
9 in 10 babies born in parts

33:16.100 --> 33:18.100
of Britain have a foreign parent.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.100
That's the title. Do yourself a favour and keep

33:20.100 --> 33:22.100
in mind for a second the phrases

33:22.100 --> 33:24.100
9 in 10 and

33:24.100 --> 33:26.100
parts of Britain. Now, let's

33:26.100 --> 33:28.100
read the first paragraph.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.100
Almost 9 in 10 babies

33:30.100 --> 33:32.100
born in parts of Britain have at least one

33:32.100 --> 33:34.100
foreign-born parent, official figures

33:34.100 --> 33:36.100
have revealed for the first time. Almost

33:36.100 --> 33:38.100
9 in 10. Well, we've already

33:38.100 --> 33:40.100
stepped back one from the headline.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.100
Almost 9 in 10 is not 9 in 10.

33:42.100 --> 33:44.100
At least parts of Britain hasn't

33:44.100 --> 33:46.100
changed. Oh well, maybe it's some

33:46.100 --> 33:48.100
big parts. That's still a lot of people

33:48.100 --> 33:50.100
with foreign-born parents even if it was 8

33:50.100 --> 33:52.100
in 10. How about we read the

33:52.100 --> 33:54.100
second paragraph? The Office

33:54.100 --> 33:56.100
for National Statistics disclosed that

33:56.100 --> 33:58.100
in 2012, more than

33:58.100 --> 34:00.100
80% of babies born in

34:00.100 --> 34:02.100
three London boroughs

34:02.100 --> 34:04.100
had either one or both parents born outside

34:04.100 --> 34:06.100
the UK. Oh, some more

34:06.100 --> 34:08.100
backpedalling. Almost 9 in 10

34:08.100 --> 34:10.100
is actually more than 80%,

34:10.100 --> 34:12.100
which they refuse to pin down with the

34:12.100 --> 34:14.100
actual percentage. I wonder why.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.100
Actually, I know why. It's because the number wasn't

34:16.100 --> 34:18.100
convenient enough. And these foreign-born

34:18.100 --> 34:20.100
parents' children are being born at this proportion

34:20.100 --> 34:22.100
in three London

34:22.100 --> 34:24.100
boroughs. Just...

34:24.100 --> 34:26.100
just for those of you who don't know, London

34:26.100 --> 34:28.100
has 32 boroughs.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.100
The Telegraph found a very small

34:30.100 --> 34:32.100
part of Britain with a high relative

34:32.100 --> 34:34.100
birth rate among foreign-born parents

34:34.100 --> 34:36.100
and fudged the numbers enough to get

34:36.100 --> 34:38.100
an attention-grabbing headline to make it look like

34:38.100 --> 34:40.100
we're being swarmed by immigrant babies.

34:40.100 --> 34:42.100
What they actually did was draw a very

34:42.100 --> 34:44.100
small circle around a part of the country

34:44.100 --> 34:46.100
where a lot more immigrants live than the native-born

34:46.100 --> 34:48.100
population. The figures were published

34:48.100 --> 34:50.100
amid concerns that hundreds of thousands of

34:50.100 --> 34:52.100
migrants from Romania and Bulgaria

34:52.100 --> 34:54.100
could come to Britain when restrictions

34:54.100 --> 34:56.100
are lifted in the new year.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.100
Wait. Those aren't the places

34:58.100 --> 35:00.100
Rage was talking about. Rage was talking

35:00.100 --> 35:02.100
about people from Africa, and The Great Replacement

35:02.100 --> 35:04.100
is all about diagrams of maps full of

35:04.100 --> 35:06.100
little black people, overwhelming little white people,

35:06.100 --> 35:08.100
and websites pushing it tell

35:08.100 --> 35:10.100
lies about native women being encouraged

35:10.100 --> 35:12.100
to procreate with African men.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.100
This Telegraph article is scaremongering

35:14.100 --> 35:16.100
about very different groups from the current

35:16.100 --> 35:18.100
targets, who tend to be from more

35:18.100 --> 35:20.100
brown, Muslim-y countries.

35:20.100 --> 35:22.100
That's because Rage is citing an article

35:22.100 --> 35:24.100
from 2013, back when the immigration

35:24.100 --> 35:26.100
restrictions were set to be lifted, and

35:26.100 --> 35:28.100
many totally smart people feared

35:28.100 --> 35:30.100
we'd be flooded so heavily with

35:30.100 --> 35:32.100
Romanians and Bulgarians

35:32.100 --> 35:34.100
that the country would literally collapse back

35:34.100 --> 35:36.100
into the ocean from the added weight,

35:36.100 --> 35:38.100
which, as we all know, literally happened.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.100
Just kidding. This reasonable

35:40.100 --> 35:42.100
rational thinker who thinks they've out-scienced

35:42.100 --> 35:44.100
Bill Nye tried to scaremonger

35:44.100 --> 35:46.100
about immigration from the wrong place

35:46.100 --> 35:48.100
than the one they're talking about

35:48.100 --> 35:50.100
by citing the headline of a three-year-old article

35:50.100 --> 35:52.100
that all but admits it's completely

35:52.100 --> 35:54.100
misrepresenting the actual data a few

35:54.100 --> 35:56.100
paragraphs in. Hey, look!

35:56.100 --> 35:58.100
I think we figured out why she didn't bother linking

35:58.100 --> 36:00.100
it in the description. Also note that

36:00.100 --> 36:02.100
when she does show the text of the article,

36:02.100 --> 36:04.100
it's blurred, so you can't pause it

36:04.100 --> 36:06.100
and check to see how heavily

36:06.100 --> 36:08.100
distorted the article is being

36:08.100 --> 36:10.100
with the truth. Weird how she

36:10.100 --> 36:12.100
knew to do that.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.100
Almost as if she knows the source is full of shit,

36:14.100 --> 36:16.100
but didn't think anyone

36:16.100 --> 36:18.100
would bother to check.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.100
Now, if you're anything like me, and I certainly hope

36:20.100 --> 36:22.100
not, you're probably wondering why,

36:22.100 --> 36:24.100
of all the articles to cite about

36:24.100 --> 36:26.100
immigration and overpopulation,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.100
why she would pick such an old one

36:28.100 --> 36:30.100
scaremongering about immigration from a different

36:30.100 --> 36:32.100
place? Like, why of all things

36:32.100 --> 36:34.100
would this article or its data

36:34.100 --> 36:36.100
form the basis for her claims?

36:36.100 --> 36:38.100
Let's assume that you're gullible and you've been

36:38.100 --> 36:40.100
tricked into believing the lie that foreigners

36:40.100 --> 36:42.100
are coming to outbreed you, and you're so

36:42.100 --> 36:44.100
sure it's right that you don't feel the need to do

36:44.100 --> 36:46.100
any research, but you know you need to look

36:46.100 --> 36:48.100
like you did to seem credible, so you'd

36:48.100 --> 36:50.100
need a news story to flash up that looks

36:50.100 --> 36:52.100
like it supports you. How would you find

36:52.100 --> 36:54.100
an article that suits your needs? Well,

36:54.100 --> 36:56.100
if it was me, I would Google something

36:56.100 --> 36:58.100
ridiculous like, too many foreign

36:58.100 --> 37:00.100
babies, and pick the one with the most

37:00.100 --> 37:02.100
attention-getting headline that also looks like

37:02.100 --> 37:04.100
it did some actual statistical

37:04.100 --> 37:06.100
analysis. You know, like maybe the fourth

37:06.100 --> 37:08.100
one down, even. This attitude to

37:08.100 --> 37:10.100
science, studies, information,

37:10.100 --> 37:12.100
and facts is probably

37:12.100 --> 37:14.100
one of the many reasons why Rage and others

37:14.100 --> 37:16.100
found Nye's recent work so baffling.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.100
It appears that many people, without ever actually

37:18.100 --> 37:20.100
checking anything, have already decided

37:20.100 --> 37:22.100
what the truth is about issues of

37:22.100 --> 37:24.100
gender, or immigration, or global

37:24.100 --> 37:26.100
warming. Speaking of denying the

37:26.100 --> 37:28.100
science of climate change, I made a joke

37:28.100 --> 37:30.100
about Steven Crowder in the last video, and a

37:30.100 --> 37:31.100
bunch of people went,

37:31.100 --> 37:33.100
ooh, is he gonna do Crowder next?

37:33.100 --> 37:35.100
And I hate to disappoint my

37:35.100 --> 37:37.100
fan, so let's take

37:37.100 --> 37:39.100
a look at some of Stevie's work about Nye's

37:39.100 --> 37:41.100
recent work.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.100
That's an awfulâ€”retake that. Let's have a look at some

37:43.100 --> 37:45.100
of Stevie's recent work about Nye's

37:45.100 --> 37:47.100
recentâ€”I saidâ€”I did it again.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
I've saved myself the job of really having to

37:49.100 --> 37:51.100
go through his claims about the gender episode, because

37:51.100 --> 37:53.100
I've covered all the main ones already,

37:53.100 --> 37:55.100
and as we've already covered, these people

37:55.100 --> 37:57.100
have a habit of repeating each other's points.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.100
He wasâ€”he wasâ€”he's making the case that

37:59.100 --> 38:01.100
gender exists on a spectrum. By the way, very different if you go back

38:01.100 --> 38:03.100
to his old show, he did say that chromosomes determine gender.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.100
If you go back to the episodes when we were a kid.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.100
So he's done a one-eighth down there.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.100
So instead, I'll point out that his real beef

38:09.100 --> 38:11.100
with Nye comes from how Bill's vocal about

38:11.100 --> 38:13.100
climate change and doing something about it,

38:13.100 --> 38:15.100
and Crowder is sure that the science doesn't

38:15.100 --> 38:17.100
support man-made climate change, and he has

38:17.100 --> 38:19.100
some counter-arguments that he's sure are good.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.100
And then you have evidence, and the evidence

38:21.100 --> 38:23.100
disagrees with your worldview, so you deny

38:23.100 --> 38:25.100
the evidence, and then along with that,

38:25.100 --> 38:27.100
you deny the authorities that are providing

38:27.100 --> 38:29.100
the evidence. You will not deny the

38:29.100 --> 38:31.100
authorities. Now, we're going to be talkingâ€”

38:31.100 --> 38:33.100
Eee! A talk in a

38:33.100 --> 38:35.100
German voice authoritarian joke.

38:35.100 --> 38:37.100
Why, that's almost as good

38:37.100 --> 38:39.100
as knowing the science!

38:39.100 --> 38:41.100
Uh, who wants to take a bet with me that

38:41.100 --> 38:43.100
at some point, he's recently made a video

38:43.100 --> 38:45.100
accusing the left of calling everyone

38:45.100 --> 38:47.100
Nazis and how unproductive that is?

38:47.100 --> 38:49.100
Just kidding. I've seen more than

38:49.100 --> 38:51.100
one of his videos, so I know he does that.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.100
The left has been so busy

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100
calling everyone Nazis.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.100
Who would dare invoke

38:57.100 --> 38:59.100
needless comparison to the Nazis?

38:59.100 --> 39:01.100
What sort of imbecile

39:01.100 --> 39:03.100
would dare do

39:03.100 --> 39:05.100
something like that? Ah, no,

39:05.100 --> 39:07.100
he's just talking authoritatively in a

39:07.100 --> 39:09.100
German voice. That's not necessarily

39:09.100 --> 39:11.100
invoking comparison to the Nazis

39:11.100 --> 39:13.100
for political points.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.100
Completely unrelatedly, just, you know,

39:15.100 --> 39:17.100
nothing to do with the last sentence,

39:17.100 --> 39:19.100
here's a segment from a video that he did

39:19.100 --> 39:21.100
about Nye on climate change.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.100
Now, everybody, science is

39:23.100 --> 39:25.100
political. Science is political.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.100
Incorrect. First, let me

39:27.100 --> 39:29.100
draw your attention to the definition of science.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.100
The intellectual and

39:31.100 --> 39:33.100
practical activity... Oh my god.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.100
I forgot that he actually cites

39:35.100 --> 39:37.100
the dictionary definition of science

39:37.100 --> 39:39.100
to try and avoid

39:39.100 --> 39:41.100
accepting the basic fact that, like,

39:41.100 --> 39:43.100
in order to stop the world from

39:43.100 --> 39:45.100
melting down, scientists might

39:45.100 --> 39:47.100
have to try and influence policy.

39:47.100 --> 39:49.100
Wait, wait, wait, no, this gets worse, doesn't it?

39:49.100 --> 39:51.100
Merging politics and science, not allowing

39:51.100 --> 39:53.100
them to exist autonomously of each other

39:53.100 --> 39:55.100
can only serve to alter

39:55.100 --> 39:57.100
science's trajectory to the path of truth.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.100
Okay? That's the main purpose here, and

39:59.100 --> 40:01.100
Nye wants that specifically. Some examples?

40:01.100 --> 40:03.100
I know it seems tired and old hat, but

40:03.100 --> 40:05.100
let's go to Nazi Germany. That's kind of

40:05.100 --> 40:07.100
a prime example of political science.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.100
It also, of course, led to guessing

40:09.100 --> 40:11.100
a few individuals.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.100
You heard me right. If scientists try

40:13.100 --> 40:15.100
to make the government listen to the

40:15.100 --> 40:17.100
effects of global warming and do something about it,

40:17.100 --> 40:19.100
it's the same as the Holocaust.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.100
With Steven Crowder, it's honestly

40:21.100 --> 40:23.100
a laugh a minute, watching him flip-flop between

40:23.100 --> 40:25.100
comparing everyone he doesn't like to the Nazis

40:25.100 --> 40:27.100
and their genocides, and complaining

40:27.100 --> 40:29.100
that way too many people are comparing

40:29.100 --> 40:31.100
things to the Nazis nowadays, especially those

40:31.100 --> 40:33.100
leftists, who are the only ones

40:33.100 --> 40:34.100
that do it.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.100
But where are the other scientists speaking up?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.100
Kind of like with Islam.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.100
You know, we say, where are the Muslims speaking up

40:40.100 --> 40:42.100
against the acts of terrorism? Not only against terrorismâ€”

40:42.100 --> 40:44.100
Weird how in the same video, where Crowder

40:44.100 --> 40:46.100
goes from saying how dangerous

40:46.100 --> 40:48.100
political science was to the Jews,

40:48.100 --> 40:50.100
he then, for seemingly no reason,

40:50.100 --> 40:52.100
decides to start spreading the,

40:52.100 --> 40:54.100
like, legit lie that

40:54.100 --> 40:56.100
Muslims don't condemn terror attacks.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.100
You know, I expected this video to

40:58.100 --> 41:00.100
contain lies about Bill Nye and the science.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.100
I did not expect it to contain lies

41:02.100 --> 41:04.100
about Muslims. I guess when you

41:04.100 --> 41:06.100
only have two talking points, you gotta

41:06.100 --> 41:08.100
find a way to fit them in somehow, right?

41:08.100 --> 41:10.100
You know, Steve, there are many gigantic lists

41:10.100 --> 41:12.100
out there of Muslims and Muslim groups

41:12.100 --> 41:14.100
that have come out against so-called

41:14.100 --> 41:16.100
Islamic terror.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.100
But I can't think of a single Muslim who's condemned

41:18.100 --> 41:20.100
global warming. Coincidence?

41:20.100 --> 41:22.100
Where are the Muslims speaking up

41:22.100 --> 41:24.100
against the acts of terrorism?

41:25.100 --> 41:27.100
It's very weird how he has to keep

41:27.100 --> 41:29.100
quibbling about nonsense

41:29.100 --> 41:31.100
instead of easily debunking

41:31.100 --> 41:33.100
the data he says can be easily

41:33.100 --> 41:35.100
debunked. And when he really does

41:35.100 --> 41:37.100
get around to trying to actually debunk

41:37.100 --> 41:39.100
climate science, when he's not saying

41:39.100 --> 41:41.100
people wanting to do something about it are

41:41.100 --> 41:43.100
Nazis, he's doing such a poor job

41:43.100 --> 41:45.100
of debunking it that you don't even need

41:45.100 --> 41:47.100
me to show you the flaws in his understanding.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.100
Even racists can accept

41:49.100 --> 41:51.100
climate change is a problem that begs a solution.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.100
"...problem when it comes to climate change."

41:53.100 --> 41:55.100
Yes, I agree that climate change

41:55.100 --> 41:57.100
is an actual problem, and it needs to be

41:57.100 --> 41:59.100
sorted out, and we do need to sort out

41:59.100 --> 42:01.100
the consummation of electricity,

42:01.100 --> 42:03.100
and thenâ€” I'm honestly really

42:03.100 --> 42:05.100
quite stunned that in the middle of

42:05.100 --> 42:07.100
a video complaining about the

42:07.100 --> 42:09.100
bisexual agenda, spreading

42:09.100 --> 42:11.100
racist lies,

42:11.100 --> 42:13.100
scaremongering about immigration,

42:13.100 --> 42:15.100
and whose description has to defend

42:15.100 --> 42:17.100
the fact that she says Bill Nye

42:17.100 --> 42:19.100
has a Jewish nose,

42:19.100 --> 42:21.100
Lady Stormfront

42:21.100 --> 42:23.100
still manages to have a better stance

42:23.100 --> 42:25.100
on climate change than Stephen Crowder.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.100
That's the lowest bar I've

42:27.100 --> 42:29.100
ever seen, and

42:29.100 --> 42:31.100
Crowdy Wowdy has just tripped

42:31.100 --> 42:33.100
over it, and fallen into a well.

42:33.100 --> 42:35.100
And it's not just rage that puts Crowder

42:35.100 --> 42:37.100
to shame. If you want to see his claims get debunked

42:37.100 --> 42:39.100
in more detail, there are many good videos

42:39.100 --> 42:41.100
out there by the, uh, seminal

42:41.100 --> 42:43.100
and personally inspirational Potholer54,

42:43.100 --> 42:45.100
andâ€”

42:45.100 --> 42:47.100
Armored Skeptic?!

42:47.100 --> 42:49.100
...

42:49.100 --> 42:51.100
Aw, that's right!

42:51.100 --> 42:53.100
We just came full circle!

42:53.100 --> 42:55.100
...the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain

42:55.100 --> 42:57.100
of 112 billion

42:57.100 --> 42:59.100
tons of ice per yearâ€”

42:59.100 --> 43:01.100
But you didn't mention that there's also a net

43:01.100 --> 43:03.100
loss for the entire planet.

43:03.100 --> 43:05.100
Greenland also has a

43:05.100 --> 43:07.100
major ice sheet. The total net

43:07.100 --> 43:09.100
ice loss for Greenland is an

43:09.100 --> 43:11.100
average of 269

43:11.100 --> 43:13.100
billion tons of ice

43:13.100 --> 43:15.100
every year. So the planet suffers

43:15.100 --> 43:17.100
a net loss of

43:17.100 --> 43:19.100
147 billion

43:19.100 --> 43:21.100
tons of ice every year.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.100
You see, Skeptic was wrong

43:23.100 --> 43:25.100
about most of the issues he brought up about

43:25.100 --> 43:27.100
Nye's show, because he doesn't really have

43:27.100 --> 43:29.100
a grasp of the related science. But he's

43:29.100 --> 43:31.100
right enough about climate science to know

43:31.100 --> 43:33.100
Crowder's full of shit. The truly interesting

43:33.100 --> 43:35.100
thing about Skeptic and those like him is

43:35.100 --> 43:37.100
that if you pay attention, you can quite

43:37.100 --> 43:39.100
easily discern the places where they've actually

43:39.100 --> 43:41.100
decided to employ reason and

43:41.100 --> 43:43.100
skepticism and proper fact-checking,

43:43.100 --> 43:45.100
and the places where a sort of

43:45.100 --> 43:47.100
party line has formed of the same

43:47.100 --> 43:49.100
arguments repeating themselves over and over, but

43:49.100 --> 43:51.100
no one's really thought about the

43:51.100 --> 43:53.100
issue in that much detail. For

43:53.100 --> 43:55.100
these people, ignoring the latter and the parts where

43:55.100 --> 43:57.100
they just kind of complain about the SJWs,

43:57.100 --> 43:59.100
the former can actually be quite

43:59.100 --> 44:01.100
informative and interesting. Not

44:01.100 --> 44:03.100
always, but quite often. This

44:03.100 --> 44:05.100
schism is interesting, and the solution

44:05.100 --> 44:07.100
isn't all that hard. It actually just means employing

44:07.100 --> 44:09.100
reason and skepticism, but

44:09.100 --> 44:11.100
even more, about even more

44:11.100 --> 44:13.100
things. It would be nice if

44:13.100 --> 44:15.100
he acknowledged the existence of

44:15.100 --> 44:17.100
my video criticising him, or

44:17.100 --> 44:19.100
even tried to respond

44:19.100 --> 44:21.100
at all to the points

44:21.100 --> 44:23.100
in it, but I know how long

44:23.100 --> 44:25.100
this kind of thing can take. You've got to pick

44:25.100 --> 44:27.100
what you cover with your time very carefully, or

44:27.100 --> 44:29.100
nothing gets done, and I certainly can't criticise

44:29.100 --> 44:31.100
anyone for doing what they think is right

44:31.100 --> 44:33.100
with the time they have. For example, I've

44:33.100 --> 44:35.100
spent nearly two months of my life

44:35.100 --> 44:37.100
reading data and

44:37.100 --> 44:39.100
biology books

44:39.100 --> 44:41.100
and studies about trans

44:41.100 --> 44:43.100
people, and reading about the lived

44:43.100 --> 44:45.100
experiences of being trans in order to

44:45.100 --> 44:47.100
come to a better understanding before broaching this

44:47.100 --> 44:49.100
topic and responding to criticism,

44:49.100 --> 44:51.100
before realising that most of the criticism

44:51.100 --> 44:53.100
didn't do any research, and

44:53.100 --> 44:55.100
there was really no reason

44:55.100 --> 44:57.100
for me to do most of that reading,

44:57.100 --> 44:59.100
and I've had basically no

44:59.100 --> 45:01.100
chances to show all the work

45:01.100 --> 45:03.100
I did in this video, and I'm thoroughly

45:03.100 --> 45:05.100
disappointed in myself.

45:05.100 --> 45:07.100
I accidentally took the time to educate

45:07.100 --> 45:09.100
myself, to no benefit other than

45:09.100 --> 45:11.100
my own personal expansion of knowledge,

45:11.100 --> 45:13.100
like some kind of loser who

45:13.100 --> 45:15.100
thinks that's important, and

45:15.100 --> 45:17.100
to think I did all that just

45:17.100 --> 45:19.100
to respond to videos

45:19.100 --> 45:21.100
covering an episode of a show that I didn't think

45:21.100 --> 45:23.100
was very good at covering the issues anyway.

45:23.100 --> 45:25.100
I want to close by focusing on a section

45:25.100 --> 45:27.100
of that episode that a lot of people complained

45:27.100 --> 45:29.100
about, probably because it rightfully made them

45:29.100 --> 45:31.100
feel uncomfortable, because

45:31.100 --> 45:33.100
it made me feel a bit uncomfortable too.

45:33.100 --> 45:35.100
So I'm gonna ask for a little help with that, and who

45:35.100 --> 45:37.100
better to talk about sex than two

45:37.100 --> 45:39.100
cis male

45:39.100 --> 45:41.100
white guys?

45:41.100 --> 45:43.100
It sat with me because I really

45:43.100 --> 45:45.100
can't avoid what it's pointing out.

45:45.100 --> 45:47.100
I can talk all day about whatever the right way

45:47.100 --> 45:49.100
to discuss or present these issues might be,

45:49.100 --> 45:51.100
but at the end of that day, I will still

45:51.100 --> 45:53.100
be an outsider to those issues.

45:53.100 --> 45:55.100
I was deeply curious what the opinion

45:55.100 --> 45:57.100
of someone who's actually affected by these issues

45:57.100 --> 45:59.100
might be about the show, so

45:59.100 --> 46:01.100
I reached out to trans YouTuber Zinnia Jones

46:01.100 --> 46:03.100
for her perspective on the issues, and

46:03.100 --> 46:05.100
she sent me this. Let's watch.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.600
Hi, I'm Zinnia Jones.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.600
I'm a trans woman, and I've been

46:09.600 --> 46:11.600
covering transgender issues on YouTube

46:11.600 --> 46:13.600
for several years. Personally,

46:13.600 --> 46:15.600
I enjoyed Bill Nye's presentation

46:15.600 --> 46:17.600
of the spectrum of gender and sexuality.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.600
As a trans person, I've often found coverage

46:19.600 --> 46:21.600
of these topics for a cisgender audience

46:21.600 --> 46:23.600
to be oversimplified or

46:23.600 --> 46:25.600
awkward, but this episode

46:25.600 --> 46:27.600
was surprisingly painless and even

46:27.600 --> 46:29.600
charming, and it offered a nuanced

46:29.600 --> 46:31.600
explanation of human diversity that's

46:31.600 --> 46:33.600
sadly lacking in most media.

46:34.100 --> 46:36.100
I was glad to see such a high-profile presentation

46:36.100 --> 46:38.100
of concepts that I and other

46:38.100 --> 46:40.100
trans advocates have been raising

46:40.100 --> 46:42.100
awareness of for years, such as

46:42.100 --> 46:44.100
the decoupling of gender from sex

46:44.100 --> 46:46.100
and the recognition of non-binary genders.

46:46.100 --> 46:48.100
The use of gender expression

46:48.100 --> 46:50.100
in South Korea's culture was

46:50.100 --> 46:52.100
a great concrete example of how

46:52.100 --> 46:54.100
our ideas about gender can be actively

46:54.100 --> 46:56.100
shaped by societal influences,

46:56.100 --> 46:58.100
and I felt that the ice cream segment

46:58.100 --> 47:00.100
was pretty effective in connecting

47:00.100 --> 47:02.100
sexuality to something that people can

47:02.100 --> 47:04.100
viscerally understand in their lives.

47:04.100 --> 47:06.100
Being told that your favorite flavor of ice cream

47:06.100 --> 47:08.100
is wrong would

47:08.100 --> 47:10.100
make no sense, and as they

47:10.100 --> 47:12.100
depicted, the people who feel the need

47:12.100 --> 47:14.100
to try and rewrite their sexual orientation

47:14.100 --> 47:16.100
do tend to end up

47:16.100 --> 47:18.100
in some very queer situations.

47:18.100 --> 47:20.100
As someone who loved watching Bill Nye

47:20.100 --> 47:22.100
as a kid, I'll admit it was a bit strange

47:22.100 --> 47:24.100
to hear a song about handjobs

47:24.100 --> 47:26.100
and powerbombs, but

47:26.100 --> 47:28.100
on the whole, I think this episode is

47:28.100 --> 47:30.100
a good introduction for people who may

47:30.100 --> 47:32.100
not be aware of what we now know

47:32.100 --> 47:34.100
about the full range of gender and sexuality.

47:34.100 --> 47:36.100
Um.

47:36.100 --> 47:38.100
When I

47:38.100 --> 47:40.100
went to find an alternative

47:40.100 --> 47:42.100
perspective, I

47:42.100 --> 47:44.100
had kind of banked on it

47:44.100 --> 47:46.100
kind of semi-resembling the one

47:46.100 --> 47:48.100
I'd had. Like, it would have been

47:48.100 --> 47:50.100
really convenient for me if I could end the video

47:50.100 --> 47:52.100
with, hey, remember what I thought about

47:52.100 --> 47:54.100
the episode? Well, here's someone who knows way more

47:54.100 --> 47:56.100
about the issue, and they agree with me!

47:56.100 --> 47:58.100
But no, it turns out my perspective

47:58.100 --> 48:00.100
can be flawed. I think Zinnia makes

48:00.100 --> 48:02.100
an interesting point that I completely missed.

48:02.100 --> 48:04.100
Ultimately, Bill Nye's doing

48:04.100 --> 48:06.100
what Bill Nye has always done. Provide

48:06.100 --> 48:08.100
a rudimentary, baseline explanation

48:08.100 --> 48:10.100
of a topic to an audience whose science

48:10.100 --> 48:12.100
education may well have ended in high

48:12.100 --> 48:14.100
school. Like when we discussed

48:14.100 --> 48:16.100
the act of writing an episode of this

48:16.100 --> 48:18.100
show earlier, pointing this out

48:18.100 --> 48:20.100
puts a lot of this episode in perspective.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.100
Nye's show is for such a broad audience

48:22.100 --> 48:24.100
of folks who may not know anything

48:24.100 --> 48:26.100
about the topic. In a way,

48:26.100 --> 48:28.100
the only people who this episode isn't

48:28.100 --> 48:30.100
for are people who already

48:30.100 --> 48:32.100
think a lot about the topic,

48:32.100 --> 48:34.100
people who live the topic because it's a part

48:34.100 --> 48:36.100
of their daily lives, and

48:36.100 --> 48:38.100
of course, people who think that by

48:38.100 --> 48:40.100
simply thinking about this issue too

48:40.100 --> 48:42.100
much, you've taken the wrong side

48:42.100 --> 48:44.100
in a culture war, something

48:44.100 --> 48:46.100
something liberal agenda, blah

48:46.100 --> 48:48.100
blah, too pro-gay.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.100
Now, at this point, I am

48:50.100 --> 48:52.100
contractually obliged to mention that exposure

48:52.100 --> 48:54.100
to this video directly may make you up to

48:54.100 --> 48:56.100
15% more gay, so

48:56.100 --> 48:58.100
it's highly recommended that you wear your

48:58.100 --> 49:00.100
ideological protection goggles provided

49:00.100 --> 49:02.100
underneath your siâ€”hang on a second.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.100
Why is this written at the end of the script?

49:10.100 --> 49:12.100
Hey there, thanks for watching.

49:12.100 --> 49:14.100
I'd like to thank Horikawa Otone for

49:14.100 --> 49:16.100
letting me butcher her name like that

49:16.100 --> 49:18.100
and also for help with the research that went

49:18.100 --> 49:20.100
into making this video. If there's any mistakes,

49:20.100 --> 49:22.100
it's because I forgot to run them past her.

49:22.100 --> 49:24.100
I'd also like to thank Zinnia Jones for recording

49:24.100 --> 49:26.100
her contribution, that was very nice of her,

49:26.100 --> 49:28.100
and also ContraPoints for recording that one

49:28.100 --> 49:30.100
line, which she did on incredibly short

49:30.100 --> 49:32.100
notice, like the day before this video was

49:32.100 --> 49:34.100
gonna come out. Thank you very much for that, Contra.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.100
Most of the music used in this video,

49:36.100 --> 49:38.100
including the song you're hearing right now,

49:38.100 --> 49:40.100
was created by Krista Lee from her album

49:40.100 --> 49:42.100
Fantasy Zone, a tribute to the music of

49:42.100 --> 49:44.100
various Sega games. It's on Bandcamp,

49:44.100 --> 49:46.100
check it out, link in the description.

49:46.100 --> 49:48.100
And, finally, thanks

49:48.100 --> 49:50.100
to all my lovely patrons for enabling

49:50.100 --> 49:52.100
me. In addition to the names going past the screen

49:52.100 --> 49:54.100
right now, I'd especially like to thank

49:54.100 --> 49:56.100
three-fifths of a brain,

49:56.100 --> 49:58.100
a bunch of question marks, I hope that's not an error
