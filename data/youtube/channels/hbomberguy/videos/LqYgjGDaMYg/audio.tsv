0	18160	Ah, it's good to be back.
18160	23160	When we last left off, I performed raw, hardcore, mostly uncensored analysis of all of Armored
23160	26360	Skeptic's data supporting his view of gender expression.
26360	29380	Which didn't take too long, because he didn't have any.
29380	32900	This time, we're gonna do some more of that, about some more people.
32900	36940	Nothing particularly unique this time, I just thought it'd be nice to cover a few more people.
36940	40260	I wanted to do more last time, but the video started to feel like it was dragging, y'know?
40260	44220	Let's have another look and see if there are any decent rebuttals to Nye's recent work.
44220	48660	We'll be looking for a couple of basic things, like if the arguments actually hold water
48660	54500	when you look at them, uh, if they have any, uh, sources or data that they cite, if they
54500	60340	put it in the description, so people can click to check if it's actually right or not.
60340	62500	Uh, y'know, really basic stuff like that.
62500	65500	I'm sure that's a low bar that no one will be tripped over, right?
67500	70500	WHO'S FIRST?
70500	73100	[â™ª intro music â™ª
73100	74100	BOOM
74100	76100	Well, there's this Mouthy Buddha guy.
76100	80100	His attempts to criticize Rachel Bloom's musical segment caused him to devolve into screaming
80100	85100	MY PUSSY over and over until he was literally just reverberating and pulling a stupid face.
85100	87100	MY PUSSY!
87100	90100	MY PUSSY! MY PUSSY TALKS!
90100	92100	MY PUSSY!
92100	95100	MY PUSSY!
95100	97100	He seems like a lovely individual.
97100	101100	He's using the very popular rhetorical strategy of acting like a fucking idiot and then saying
101100	103100	THAT'S WHAT I THINK FEMINISM IS!
103100	105100	ME BEING STUPID PROVES THEY'RE STUPID!
105100	109100	I put some jokes at his expense in the last video, and I thought it would be funny to just use
109100	112100	that clip of him doing that and then not go back to him ever again.
112100	116100	But even if I wanted to do more than that, I'd have some trouble because the video is mostly
116100	122100	just him whining about how morally evil it is that Rachel Bloom empowered ignorant women,
122100	127100	and how betrayed he feels by Bill Nye for not saying what he decided was true about the issue.
127100	129100	Dude, name the smartest people in the world.
129100	133100	They all think this gender fluidity shit is BULLSHIT!
133100	138100	ðŸŽ¶
138100	143100	ðŸŽ¶
143100	146100	ðŸŽ¶
146100	148100	ðŸŽ¶
148100	151100	No evidence is necessary to support his beliefs, apparently.
151100	153100	Who is this empowering?
153100	155100	It's empowering ignorant women!
155100	160100	People that you are dancing with are making our civilized western culture
160100	163100	more and more degenerate every day.
163100	166100	I thought feminists were worthless and unproductive members of society,
166100	170100	but according to genius non-foot shooter Mouthy Buddha,
170100	174100	it turns out that actually, western civilization is so weak and vulnerable
174100	179100	that Rachel Bloom can destroy it with a song about her vagina.
179100	183100	Listen, mate, if you think our great civilization is that weak,
183100	185100	maybe you should move somewhere else.
185100	188100	Presumably back to the spitting image puppet dimension.
188100	191100	His other videos try really hard to be dramatic pseudo-documentaries
191100	195100	with text effects, ornate fonts, and important sounding music
195100	199100	as he talks in a dramatic voice about how IQ is totally a real measurement
199100	201100	of human ability and behavior.
201100	204100	We need to understand the validity of IQ
204100	208100	to know that this is real and predictive of human behavior.
208100	211100	ðŸŽ¶
211100	214100	You know, for someone who seems incredibly certain
214100	217100	that IQ is a valid and important unit of measuring a person's intelligence,
218100	222100	Mouthy Buddha doesn't appear to have listed his own IQ anywhere.
223100	227100	I invite you to come to the one conclusion there can be
227100	229100	about why he wouldn't do that.
229100	232100	These videos attempt to create the illusion that he's smart
232100	235100	and needs to be taken seriously, but he's already put out a video
235100	237100	where he whines and vibrates at a camera,
237100	239100	so the genie's out of the bottle there, mate.
239100	241100	While I could point and laugh at how he's a libertarian
241100	244100	trying desperately to backpedal from supporting the alt-right
244100	246100	after realizing that his bedfellows don't seem to realize
246100	248100	that eugenics is unethical,
248100	251100	or pretend that his other work means he's worth taking seriously,
251100	253100	I think it would be funnier not to.
253100	254100	Who's next?
254100	259100	Do you have any idea how reputationally damning this is?
261100	264100	Well, there's this guy who calls himself SomeBlackGuy.
264100	266100	His video's entitled,
266100	268100	"'Bill Nye Ruins My Childhood.'"
268100	271100	Oh dear, did the science man hurt your feelings?
271100	274100	But I thought rational people put facts over feelings.
274100	276100	Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
276100	279100	Bill Nye is now diving into the magical fantasy land
279100	281100	of progressive identity politics,
281100	283100	and he's doing it by, uh, his show,
283100	285100	uh, Bill Nye Saves the World,
285100	288100	and I've only seen bits and pieces of it,
288100	291100	and I-I-I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna watch it all the way through.
291100	292100	Oh, great.
292100	294100	Not only has he not actually seen the show,
294100	296100	just the cherry-picked chunks that ended up on YouTube,
296100	298100	he doesn't even plan on watching it.
298100	300100	Points for honesty, I guess.
300100	302100	For most of the video, he plays clips
302100	304100	from the scant bits he has seen
304100	307100	and pauses them to cut away and try and make a clever riff.
307100	309100	Standard cutaway commentary stuff.
309100	312100	But it's actually a lot sexier than that.
312100	313100	I don't know about you guys,
313100	316100	but there's absolutely nothing sexy about this whatsoever.
316100	317100	Heh.
317100	319100	Bill said it was sexy for a joke,
319100	322100	and the audience laughed along because it was a joke,
322100	325100	but Derek says it isn't very sexy at all.
325100	327100	Oh, my God, he's got him.
327100	330100	He's owning him online with discourse.
330100	333100	Can you feel the logic and reason yet?
333100	334100	And then for the rest of the video,
334100	337100	he extemporizes about the horrifying state of the world
337100	340100	now that some people identify as non-binary.
340100	342100	And now you have a bunch of people that,
342100	343100	that just wanna be heard.
343100	345100	They want, they don't wanna be normal.
345100	347100	They wanna, they wanna live in this fantasy world
347100	349100	where there's all these different options and shit.
349100	351100	Oh, no!
351100	354100	People want to have options now.
355100	357100	Like, you're starting to see on, on websites
357100	359100	where they have multiple options for gender
359100	361100	where it was just always man or woman.
361100	362100	Now there's like, oh, fuck that.
362100	363100	No, I'm, no.
363100	366100	Non-binary or something else should be an option.
366100	368100	I'm like, why?
368100	370100	It's not that fucking serious, dude.
370100	372100	I mean, I know to a lot of people it is,
372100	376100	but in, in, in, in the, in the grand scale of things,
376100	378100	this is extremely trivial.
378100	380100	I agree, it is extremely trivial.
380100	381100	When someone comes up to me and says,
381100	384100	I'd rather you refer to me by these pronouns from now on.
384100	386100	I say, yeah, all right,
386100	388100	because it's really not that hard,
388100	391100	and it doesn't really affect my life all that much.
391100	394100	Oh, no, sorry, you meant the other kind of trivial.
394100	396100	The kind where you spend days of your life
396100	399100	recording YouTube videos, complaining about it
399100	402100	while insisting that it's trivial.
402100	403100	Sure.
403100	404100	I asked for a little help with that,
404100	406100	and who better to talk about sex
406100	410100	than two...sexy...
410100	414100	two...cis-male white guys?
414100	416100	This dude has fallen off the deep end.
416100	418100	Why couldn't these people,
418100	420100	why couldn't Bill Nye or anybody,
420100	422100	any cis white man,
422100	424100	or just a, a cis male for, for,
424100	426100	talk about this type of stuff?
426100	428100	Like, why is this even mentioned?
428100	430100	Why would you say that?
430100	432100	It, it, like, how is that even funny?
432100	434100	My favorite part of this clip is that he realizes
434100	437100	at the very end, asking these dumbass questions
437100	439100	about why would you dare say that,
439100	440100	that Bill was just making a joke,
440100	442100	so he suddenly cuts himself off and goes,
442100	444100	how is that even funny?
444100	446100	Like, you can see the moment he realizes
446100	448100	that maybe Bill Nye's sentence
448100	450100	shouldn't be taken literally seriously,
450100	452100	but he can't admit he fucked up,
452100	453100	so he just cuts himself off and goes,
453100	455100	well, I wasn't funny either.
455100	457100	Nye wasn't saying that cis male white guys
457100	459100	aren't allowed to talk about sex,
459100	460100	because they are.
460100	463100	They continue to do so after making the joke.
463100	465100	I'm really surprised by how easily
465100	467100	these folks are tripped by jokes.
467100	469100	Now, I could just systematically own Derek
469100	471100	for all the stupid shit he says
471100	472100	over the course of the video,
472100	474100	but I've set myself the lofty goal
474100	475100	of cutting through the chaff
475100	477100	and analyzing the core claims themselves
477100	479100	that appear to be holding up the rest of the rants
479100	482100	and seeing if at least they hold water.
482100	483100	You know, all this bullshit is bullshit,
483100	485100	but he might have a point in there somewhere,
485100	488100	so I did some digging and found Derek's central claim,
488100	490100	which is that Bill Nye has gone against the science,
490100	492100	and he knows this is what's happened
492100	494100	because real scientists used to say otherwise.
494100	496100	But now he wants to play make-believe
496100	497100	and say stuff like,
497100	500100	oh, gender is on a spectrum like sex, you know?
500100	503100	There's such a thing as, like, non-binary
503100	505100	and stuff like that when, you know,
505100	507100	before, like, any other science, uh,
507100	508100	or scientist that has come before him
508100	510100	has just said there's two genders
510100	512100	and they're determined by the chromosomes.
512100	513100	Chromosomes?
513100	514100	Whatever, he probably misspoke.
514100	516100	He doesn't provide any data or studies
516100	519100	to support the idea that gender is determined by chromosomes,
519100	521100	but he also doesn't even dare say that himself.
521100	522100	Instead, he says,
522100	524100	well, scientists say it,
524100	526100	and he believes those scientists over Bill
526100	529100	because, well, they say what he thinks is true.
529100	531100	Certainly not because he's seen the evidence himself
531100	533100	because then he'd have bothered to show it to the viewer
533100	534100	and not hide behind,
534100	536100	scientists say it, wouldn't he?
536100	538100	The funny thing is he tries and fails
538100	540100	to claim that this is what Bill used to say.
540100	543100	This next clip is unintentionally amazing.
543100	545100	Something that he said himself as well.
545100	547100	In an act of utter hilarity,
547100	550100	after saying this used to be what Bill said himself,
550100	553100	he cuts to a scene from an old episode of Science Guy
553100	556100	where someone who is definitely not Bill himself
556100	558100	explains chromosomes.
558100	559100	Before you're born,
559100	561100	your mom gives you one of her chromosomes
561100	563100	and your dad gives you one of his.
563100	564100	Now, we're gonna investigate that claim
564100	566100	in a little more detail in a sec,
566100	570100	but first, let's stop and think like video editors for a bit.
570100	572100	Look, it's my one actual area of expertise.
572100	574100	I was gonna shoehorn this bit in somewhere.
574100	575100	I'm going to be charitable here
575100	579100	and assume that Derek did some research in advance.
579100	581100	He probably at least watched some of the clips
581100	583100	from the ice cream bit or the musical bit
583100	585100	that people were spreading on YouTube
585100	586100	and saw people claiming on Twitter
586100	589100	that Nye used to say genders caused by chromosomes
589100	592100	and then hit record assuming Bill had actually said it.
592100	593100	Now, the question is,
593100	596100	why would he think Bill had actually said it himself
596100	597100	in the first place?
597100	599100	He must have got this idea from somewhere.
599100	601100	Well, in the spheres Derek runs in,
601100	603100	a very popular image was circulating on Twitter
603100	606100	with a picture of Bill holding up a diagram of chromosomes
606100	608100	with subtitles claiming they decide a person's gender.
608100	610100	These subtitles were fake.
610100	612100	Nye said nothing of the sort in that actual segment.
612100	615100	The image was spread by noted bastion of truth
615100	617100	and ant enthusiast Ian Miles Chong
617100	619100	in the hopes of convincing gullible idiots,
619100	621100	and, well, evidently it did.
621100	623100	It appears that Derek here took it for granted
623100	625100	that that was what Bill had said
625100	627100	and didn't even check it was true until after recording,
627100	629100	so he had to use this clip of someone else
629100	631100	saying something that you could twist
631100	633100	to be about gender instead.
633100	635100	Now, I'm just spitballing here.
635100	638100	There's no way of proving that's the exact chain of events.
638100	640100	Uh, Derek could have just missed
640100	642100	the widely shared lie
642100	644100	tweeted by Chong,
644100	646100	who he follows on Twitter,
646100	648100	and which was originally tweeted
648100	651100	just minutes before Derek tweeted,
651100	653100	why is Bill Nye all over my feed?
653100	655100	You know, it could have been a different chain of events,
655100	657100	but it wasn't.
657100	660100	Now, I'm not saying Derek saw a fake screenshot
660100	662100	and took it as fact without checking
662100	664100	and that this is antithetical to the very principles
664100	666100	he claims Bill Nye has abandoned,
666100	669100	but it certainly looks exactly like that.
669100	671100	However, let's ignore this blatant ignorance
671100	673100	and hypocrisy and talk a little about the segment
673100	675100	he did end up using, featuring someone
675100	678100	who isn't Bill Nye talking about chromosomes.
678100	680100	This clip is also widely used elsewhere
680100	682100	to claim Nye's previous show was right
682100	684100	and then he got infected by feminism or something.
684100	687100	Derek contrasts this old clip from 1996
687100	689100	with his present stance on the issue in his new show.
689100	691100	Many months later...
691100	693100	I used to think there were just two settings,
693100	695100	male and female.
695100	697100	At least you actually had a clip of Bill talking
697100	699100	about the issue this time, Derek.
699100	701100	The implication, of course, is that Nye has abandoned
701100	703100	the science and become a liar,
703100	705100	but this reflects a very poor understanding
705100	707100	of the absolute basics of Bill Nye's old show
707100	709100	and how it was constructed primarily
709100	712100	to give children a baseline understanding
712100	714100	of science in the 90s.
714100	716100	The old show, I hate to point out,
716100	718100	never really did cover sex, gender,
718100	721100	or sexuality in much detail, if at all.
721100	723100	Covering these issues on a show for kids in the 90s
723100	725100	was pretty much off-limits.
725100	727100	You'd come under fire for indoctrinating children
727100	729100	into an evil agenda and other gay panic nonsense
729100	731100	bullshit garbage.
731100	733100	You know, the sort of thing similar
733100	735100	Neo-Puritans would do in the modern day
735100	737100	if, let's say,
737100	739100	there was a YouTube channel aimed at educating kids
739100	741100	about these issues.
741100	743100	I wonder why the producers wanted to avoid
743100	745100	the ire of Derek's ideological predecessors
745100	747100	and risk getting pulled from the air
747100	749100	or sent death threats.
749100	751100	They steered well clear and, to my knowledge,
751100	753100	only ever barely broached the subject
753100	755100	of sex differences when it's in relation
755100	756100	to something else.
756100	758100	The segment all the idiots are pointing to
758100	760100	is from an episode about probability.
760100	762100	No, not sex.
762100	764100	Not here's an episode on how chromosomes work.
764100	766100	Probability.
766100	768100	Imagine for a moment that you're one of the writers of this show.
768100	770100	Let's say you're writing an episode of a science show
770100	772100	about probability,
772100	774100	and you have 23 minutes to explain it to an audience,
774100	776100	and an example you want to give
776100	778100	is the probability of which sex you were born.
778100	780100	And if Dad gives you an X2,
780100	782100	then you become a girl.
782100	784100	But if he gives you his Y,
784100	786100	then you become a boy.
786100	788100	Even though, because you know your stuff,
788100	790100	because you're a researcher for a show about science,
790100	792100	the science behind transgender people is known to you,
792100	794100	you're writing in an era where,
794100	796100	generally speaking, the terms
796100	798100	sex and gender are conflated in common parlance.
798100	800100	And you're writing a show for kids.
800100	802100	In fact, you're writing lines for an actual
802100	804100	kid to say, so you have her say,
804100	806100	if you have a Y chromosome, you're a boy
806100	808100	for convenience's sake.
808100	810100	You also wrote a funny skit where Bill picks the wrong door
810100	812100	to his lab and falls off the roof of a building.
812100	814100	Huh? Oh, oh, oh, oh!
814100	816100	Oh, boy.
816100	818100	See, there are only two possibilities.
818100	820100	You know, as a writer for the show,
820100	822100	that there's a probability of a person
822100	824100	being intersex or other rare
824100	826100	chromosomal differences that complicate this simple
826100	828100	one and two probability.
828100	830100	But you know that taking the time to explain this here
830100	832100	would mean cutting into the Wizard of Odds skit
832100	834100	where you reenact the Wizard of Oz
834100	836100	and Bill Nye is the Wizard.
836100	838100	If you want to improve the chances of getting home safely,
838100	840100	wear a seatbelt.
840100	842100	The chance of becoming either a boy or a girl
842100	844100	is always one in two.
844100	846100	A 50-50 chance either way.
846100	848100	It's like flipping a coin.
848100	850100	Mm-hmm.
850100	852100	X, you're a girl. Y, you're a boy.
852100	854100	You also, because you're not an idiot,
854100	856100	have done more than five seconds of research
856100	858100	and know that the probability in most industrialized
858100	860100	nations of being born physically male
860100	862100	is generally higher than being born
862100	864100	physically female, so the chances are more like
864100	866100	1.05 in two, meaning
866100	868100	it's not like flipping a coin so much as like
868100	870100	flipping a coin that's very slightly weighted
870100	872100	as a result of complex environmental factors.
872100	874100	And there's also the rare but real
874100	876100	possibility of the coin landing on its side.
876100	878100	You don't bring this up either, because Bill
878100	880100	really doesn't want to cut the skit where he counts
880100	882100	dice possibilities next to the giant fan
882100	884100	he stole from the set of Blade Runner.
884100	886100	And since the video is boiling down probabilities
886100	888100	for children, you leave it out,
888100	890100	hoping people more discerning of the science
890100	892100	will understand why you left it out,
892100	894100	and privately, you pray that none of the
894100	896100	kids in the audience will grow up to call Bill Nye
896100	898100	a liar when he explains the more complicated
898100	900100	version to them as adults.
900100	902100	Does he cite any sources to back up his claims
902100	904100	throughout the video? Why,
904100	906100	some black guy gives an exhaustingly
906100	908100	comprehensive list of his merch store,
908100	910100	Patreon, PayPal,
910100	912100	Second Channel, Twitch,
912100	914100	Instagram, Ask.FM, Snapchat,
914100	916100	email, Grindr,
916100	918100	Chimney, Splango,
918100	920100	et cetera, et cetera.
920100	922100	Unfortunately, he doesn't cite any
922100	924100	sources because he doesn't have any to
924100	926100	back up his beliefs, but he feels
926100	928100	very strongly that he's right, and that's why
928100	930100	you should check out the t-shirts for sale in his
930100	932100	merch store. For example, this one about
932100	934100	how facts are more important than feelings.
934100	936100	And he's right. In making an
936100	938100	informed argument, facts are
938100	940100	important. Would have been
940100	942100	great if he'd had any, wouldn't it?
942100	944100	Some black guy, more like
944100	946100	some lack of evidence
946100	948100	got, oh, cut that
948100	950100	out. That's just rubbish.
950100	952100	I hope you're sick
952100	954100	of bullshit because here's YouTuber
954100	956100	No Bullshit with his video entitled
956100	958100	Bill Nye Goes Full SJW
958100	960100	Trashes Whites
960100	962100	Praises Transgenders and Gays
962100	964100	and by no bullshit, I
964100	966100	apparently meant to say no sources.
966100	968100	I bet we're in for a real science
968100	970100	and research fest here.
970100	972100	...
972100	974100	...
974100	976100	...
976100	978100	I'm sick of people over
978100	980100	inflating the amounts of gay and transgender
980100	982100	people in the population, and I have nothing
982100	984100	against the people, don't get me wrong.
984100	986100	I'm just sick of this overly gay, overly
986100	988100	pro-trans narrative being pushed
988100	990100	everywhere. Everywhere that toes the line with
990100	992100	the liberal SJW PC
992100	994100	crowd. It's gotten beyond annoying and
994100	996100	is verging into unsettling and disturbing
996100	998100	places. When I clicked a video
998100	1000100	by someone called No Bullshit, I thought
1000100	1002100	I was entering an intellectual thunderdome.
1002100	1004100	But so far, all he's done is
1004100	1006100	complain about the overly
1006100	1008100	gay, overly pro-trans
1008100	1010100	narrative that's being pushed
1010100	1012100	everywhere by the liberals. I thought
1012100	1014100	this was supposed to be about science,
1014100	1016100	but this guy's just sharing his feelings
1016100	1018100	about the liberals.
1018100	1020100	What is this? No Bullshit's whole deal
1020100	1022100	appears to be to pause during whatever
1022100	1024100	he's watching partway through to fantasize
1024100	1026100	about the deep, hidden
1026100	1028100	emotions or the evil agendas
1028100	1030100	of the people on screen.
1030100	1032100	God,
1032100	1034100	even the new theme song is shittier.
1034100	1036100	And it just screams, I'm desperate to be
1036100	1038100	cool and hip again. Here's a black guy singing
1038100	1040100	my theme song. I'm down.
1040100	1042100	Now either Mr. Bullshit, if that is his real
1042100	1044100	name, which I'm going to assume it is,
1044100	1046100	can read minds, or he's just written
1046100	1048100	an elaborate fanfiction about
1048100	1050100	Bill Nye wanting to look
1050100	1052100	hip, so he personally gets
1052100	1054100	Tyler, the creator, to make the new theme.
1054100	1056100	Because apparently no one else
1056100	1058100	is involved with the production of a show.
1058100	1060100	The man the camera's appointed at,
1060100	1062100	he personally writes it all.
1062100	1064100	He commissions everything that goes into the show.
1064100	1066100	He personally hires all the animators.
1066100	1068100	It's all Bill Nye. It's not like
1068100	1070100	there's a production crew or anything.
1070100	1072100	Who better to talk about sex than two
1072100	1074100	cis-male
1074100	1076100	white guys?
1076100	1078100	And this is also where
1078100	1080100	I lose all hope for the show.
1080100	1082100	Anyone who uses the word cis is either an
1082100	1084100	MW whack job, or they're someone who's trying
1084100	1086100	to pander to them. If you hear someone say a
1086100	1088100	word you don't like, pause the video to
1088100	1090100	complain about how that makes them the bad
1090100	1092100	people. Bonus points if you
1092100	1094100	then go on to make videos complaining about how
1094100	1096100	everyone else is easily offended by words.
1096100	1098100	They pull it off with
1098100	1100100	so much confidence that it doesn't
1100100	1102100	feel weird, it just feels like, hey.
1102100	1104100	So now we jump to Veritasium on location
1104100	1106100	in Korea. And to be honest, listening
1106100	1108100	to this K-pop weirdo talk,
1108100	1110100	I feel the same way Veritasium looks.
1110100	1112100	He looks squinty. He's looking
1112100	1114100	down on this creeper, raising his upper lip
1114100	1116100	in disgust. He looks
1116100	1118100	squinty, and that means he's
1118100	1120100	looking down on the person he's interviewing.
1120100	1122100	He secretly hates them.
1122100	1124100	This Rachel Bloom bitch sounds like she's
1124100	1126100	trying to be the next Amy Schumer or something.
1126100	1128100	My vagina. My vagina.
1128100	1130100	No one cares about your gross vagina,
1130100	1132100	lady. I'm not gonna even touch those
1132100	1134100	frankly Freudian comments
1134100	1136100	about finding vaginas weird.
1136100	1138100	Now as can be plainly seen, this
1138100	1140100	no-bullshit fellow doesn't really have any
1140100	1142100	understanding of the science and isn't all that bright
1142100	1144100	otherwise. So he doesn't even really
1144100	1146100	understand why he's so angry
1146100	1148100	that the show is too
1148100	1150100	pro-gay. So he wallpapers
1150100	1152100	over the cracks in his own understanding
1152100	1154100	by imagining that everyone
1154100	1156100	on screen is sad and
1156100	1158100	angry and hateful and wants to
1158100	1160100	look cool and is pushing an agenda
1160100	1162100	and is an evil liberal
1162100	1164100	and wants to be like Amy Schumer.
1164100	1166100	Which doesn't really make any sense.
1166100	1168100	No one wants to be like Amy Schumer.
1168100	1170100	Not even Amy Schumer wants to be like Amy Schumer.
1170100	1172100	Now, if I
1172100	1174100	really wanted to, I could go
1174100	1176100	through the entire video and make one of my
1176100	1178100	patented, citation-needed
1178100	1180100	jokes every single time he makes
1180100	1182100	a claim and then doesn't support it with any
1182100	1184100	evidence whatsoever. This still doesn't
1184100	1186100	change the fact that there are only two genders.
1186100	1188100	But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book
1188100	1190100	But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book
1190100	1192100	But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book
1192100	1194100	But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book
1194100	1196100	and just imagine that he likes the smell of his own
1196100	1198100	farts and then move on without thinking about him too much.
1200100	1202100	Ugh, we're running out of people
1202100	1204100	pretending they have compelling arguments.
1204100	1206100	Quick! What about Previous Appearance Have a
1206100	1208100	Red Pill Philosophy? The guy who couldn't even
1208100	1210100	remember the names of the main characters of
1210100	1212100	The Force Awakens in the car after getting out
1212100	1214100	of the theater? Maybe his video
1214100	1216100	Bill Nye's Netflix Show
1216100	1218100	Trashes White People, Glorifies
1218100	1220100	Transge-
1220100	1222100	Wait, haven't we seen that title before?
1222100	1224100	So it's like a game. You guys are
1224100	1226100	writing the same thing. I love that clip.
1226100	1228100	It's from Roosh complaining to some journalists
1228100	1230100	accusing them of secretly plotting to push
1230100	1232100	a unified narrative by writing
1232100	1234100	similar articles, as if there's a multitude
1234100	1236100	of ways of reporting about his legalized
1236100	1238100	rape article, but I like reusing
1238100	1240100	it in a better context of people in his
1240100	1242100	sphere copying each other's work.
1242100	1244100	I can't wait for them to start suing each other.
1244100	1246100	Those court cases are gonna be hilarious.
1246100	1248100	But speaking of doing the same thing, at this point, I'm
1248100	1250100	starting to see a lot of repeat performances
1250100	1252100	of people plotting out the same arguments again and again
1252100	1254100	in new, even more uninformed
1254100	1256100	incarnations. We've got the
1256100	1258100	lecturing the white race argument.
1258100	1260100	Some Indian dude came on
1260100	1262100	to Bill Nye's show
1262100	1264100	to lecture white people about cultural
1264100	1266100	appropriation! Prashant's
1266100	1268100	lectured the entire
1268100	1270100	white race on how it's unacceptable
1270100	1272100	to use Asian mysticism
1272100	1274100	because it's from a different culture.
1274100	1276100	You've got complaints that it's too political
1276100	1278100	to even talk about this stuff, or
1278100	1280100	outright fantasies of a secret liberal
1280100	1282100	agenda. Pushing leftist
1282100	1284100	liberal SJW narratives.
1284100	1286100	This episode is very clearly
1286100	1288100	politically driven. Oh, it's-it's-it's politics,
1288100	1290100	like, bringing the politics
1290100	1292100	into the science. And we've got the same sob
1292100	1294100	stories about how he used to like Bill, but
1294100	1296100	then he betrayed me! Bill Nye
1296100	1298100	is a childhood hero to a lot of people,
1298100	1300100	including myself. His television show
1300100	1302100	Bill Nye the Science Guy was informative,
1302100	1304100	innovative, and entertaining.
1304100	1306100	I was extremely excited
1306100	1308100	when Netflix announced that they'd be releasing
1308100	1310100	a brand new Bill Nye series.
1310100	1312100	You used to be a voice
1312100	1314100	for hard science.
1314100	1316100	When I was a child,
1316100	1318100	you were just this cool figure
1318100	1320100	for science. You are a representative
1320100	1322100	of science, and you just
1322100	1324100	shit over all of it! And of course
1324100	1326100	we've got the fantastic repeat performance
1326100	1328100	of not bothering to cite any sources or studies
1328100	1330100	to back up any of their claims.
1330100	1332100	At this point, my mind's a blur.
1332100	1334100	I can't honestly tell you what Red Pill Philosophy
1334100	1336100	said in his video, and the first time
1336100	1338100	I watched it, I wasn't sure if I'd somehow seen
1338100	1340100	it before and forgotten. I tried to re-watch
1340100	1342100	it and see if he says anything worth specifically
1342100	1344100	debunking, but my eyes just
1344100	1346100	slide off him and I start to think about
1346100	1348100	all the vacuuming I could be doing.
1348100	1350100	Bill Nye, the establishment guy,
1352100	1354100	is nothing but an establishment
1354100	1356100	shill, nothing but
1356100	1358100	establishment propaganda. If you go
1358100	1360100	to the Twitter page of that March for
1360100	1362100	Science, uh, Twitter page,
1362100	1364100	it's at establishment propaganda.
1364100	1366100	Bill Nye, the propaganda
1366100	1368100	guy. Bill Nye, the
1368100	1370100	establishment guy.
1370100	1372100	Um, so Bill Nye, the propaganda guy.
1372100	1374100	Bill Nye, the establishment shill guy.
1374100	1376100	At this point in my
1376100	1378100	quest, I was desperate for someone,
1378100	1380100	anyone who had something different
1380100	1382100	to say. It didn't even have to be right.
1382100	1384100	At this point, a different set of wrong
1384100	1386100	arguments would have been enough to make me feel
1386100	1388100	alive again, and then
1388100	1390100	out of the darkness came
1390100	1392100	Rage After Storm. Rage After Storm
1392100	1394100	is one of those YouTubers who
1394100	1396100	actively courts a far-right audience
1396100	1398100	and likes to talk about how race is real
1398100	1400100	and tweet about how Hitler had
1400100	1402100	some really good ideas. This video
1402100	1404100	is entitled Bill Nye, the
1404100	1406100	Jewish guy.
1406100	1408100	Please stop getting triggered over the Jew thing.
1408100	1410100	It's a reference to the nose.
1410100	1412100	It was just banter.
1412100	1414100	The video opens a little familiarly to begin with,
1414100	1416100	with the standard totally not-fabricated
1416100	1418100	Bill Nye sob story. I loved
1418100	1420100	him, and it made me want to think about stuff,
1420100	1422100	but then he said the bad thing. Look, I know
1422100	1424100	that so many people are starting to catch this
1424100	1426100	SJW virus,
1426100	1428100	but I never knew that it would be my
1428100	1430100	dearest Bill. I respected
1430100	1432100	him so much. No, really, he was
1432100	1434100	my muse.
1434100	1436100	But then she goes off the fucking chain.
1436100	1438100	She one-ups Armored Skeptic's
1438100	1440100	ice cream slut shaming and begins trying
1440100	1442100	to figure out which sexualities the ice
1442100	1444100	creams represent in the comedy
1444100	1446100	ice cream cartoon. You have
1446100	1448100	vanilla, that's straight. One of the flavours then has to
1448100	1450100	be a lesbian. One of them has to be gay.
1450100	1452100	One of them has to be bisexual. Okay,
1452100	1454100	someone over here is a fucked
1454100	1456100	up ice cream. She's trying to fucking
1456100	1458100	diagnose cartoon ice creams.
1458100	1460100	Which sexuality are you?
1460100	1462100	Let me get out my ice cream, Speculum.
1462100	1464100	Hey, mint chocolate chip!
1464100	1466100	Sorry I'm late. I was
1466100	1468100	busy being two awesome things at once.
1468100	1470100	Okay, nope. Choco chip is
1470100	1472100	obviously bisexual. This is weird.
1472100	1474100	Actually, chocolate chip is pretty
1474100	1476100	straightforwardly a metaphor for non-binary
1476100	1478100	or intersex people. You know,
1478100	1480100	being two awesome things
1480100	1482100	at once. Not enjoys licking
1482100	1484100	two different kinds of ice cream
1484100	1486100	at once. She can't even
1486100	1488100	pass the most basic point of the segment.
1488100	1490100	You're nuts.
1490100	1492100	Can we not encourage
1492100	1494100	gangbangs, please? Can we teach people
1494100	1496100	a bit of decency? Having a gangbang
1496100	1498100	is not something to be proud of.
1498100	1500100	Well, someone isn't invited to my
1500100	1502100	next house party, I can tell you.
1502100	1504100	Not because of that, though. Because of
1504100	1506100	the Hitler apologetics.
1506100	1508100	Again, this is exactly how STDs
1508100	1510100	spread. Being slutty is
1510100	1512100	not cool. No, being uneducated
1512100	1514100	about STDs and how they spread
1514100	1516100	is how they spread. Imagine that.
1516100	1518100	The real problem being
1518100	1520100	people being uneducated
1520100	1522100	on the issue. Imagine if that
1522100	1524100	was the real problem here.
1524100	1526100	So she continues to moral panic about how
1526100	1528100	the show is promoting being bi as cool
1528100	1530100	too much and how it's tricking people into
1530100	1532100	wanting to be bi, to be trendy. You know,
1532100	1534100	because that's how sexuality works.
1534100	1536100	Just in general, why are we advertising the fact
1536100	1538100	that bisexuality is cool?
1538100	1540100	This isn't a particularly uncommon approach
1540100	1542100	to sexuality either. You see it everywhere
1542100	1544100	in conservative criticism of progressive media.
1544100	1546100	Like with No Bullshit, the problem
1546100	1548100	isn't that LGBT people exist. Of course
1548100	1550100	not. They love gay people.
1550100	1552100	The problem is the overly
1552100	1554100	pro-LGBT narrative.
1554100	1556100	From their perspective, the issue
1556100	1558100	is people being too nice
1558100	1560100	about the bis, the
1560100	1562100	gyars, the lesbs
1562100	1564100	and the transes. And that
1564100	1566100	throws off the delicate balance
1566100	1568100	of nature or something.
1568100	1570100	They think these people are allowed to exist
1570100	1572100	and that's fine, that's okay. We've finally gotten
1572100	1574100	them that far. But
1574100	1576100	they have to exist in the background somewhere.
1576100	1578100	You can't accidentally make it look like
1578100	1580100	it's okay to be like that.
1580100	1582100	Because that's basically just pushing
1582100	1584100	their agenda on people.
1584100	1586100	None of it is meant to be like a fashion
1586100	1588100	craze or a trend or something that's cool.
1588100	1590100	Okay? It's not. This
1590100	1592100	provides people with pressure.
1592100	1594100	Pressuring people into becoming bi
1594100	1596100	and having orgies? Is that
1596100	1598100	really what the cartoon ice cream
1598100	1600100	skit does to people?
1600100	1602100	This might just be my opinion, but I don't think many
1602100	1604100	people are going to have their sexuality changed
1604100	1606100	or their identity radically
1606100	1608100	altered by media
1608100	1610100	presenting it as okay to not
1610100	1612100	be straight or not be, I'm
1612100	1614100	going to say the bad word, cover your ears,
1614100	1616100	cisgendered. I'm at the risk
1616100	1618100	of sounding a little bit stubborn here, but I just
1618100	1620100	don't accept that people who are
1620100	1622100	secure in their own sexuality are going to have theirs
1622100	1624100	changed by other people being open
1624100	1626100	about their own. Which is why my conscience
1626100	1628100	will be clear when, at the end of this sentence,
1628100	1630100	I cut to a graphic depiction
1630100	1632100	of what I get up to in my bed every
1632100	1634100	single night.
1634100	1636100	I'm playing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
1636100	1638100	You can play it anywhere because it's
1638100	1640100	portable. It's a really good game,
1640100	1642100	guys. But don't get me wrong. That doesn't
1642100	1644100	mean that there aren't very positive effects
1644100	1646100	of having good representations
1646100	1648100	of LGBT people in media.
1648100	1650100	This kind of goes without saying, but generally speaking,
1650100	1652100	it's healthy for a person
1652100	1654100	to feel like they're allowed to express
1654100	1656100	themselves and their identity without
1656100	1658100	fear of not being accepted
1658100	1660100	or of being treated like they're lesser
1660100	1662100	as a result of it. Perceiving
1662100	1664100	positive representations of LGBT people
1664100	1666100	as some kind of insidious
1666100	1668100	trick is, academically
1668100	1670100	speaking, very
1670100	1672100	stupid. Versatile love
1672100	1674100	may have some butt stuff.
1674100	1676100	Ew. I think that short clip of someone
1676100	1678100	saying butt stuff and cutting to her saying
1678100	1680100	ew sums up her coverage
1680100	1682100	of most of this episode. She seems to be
1682100	1684100	aware of how little she has to say, though,
1684100	1686100	so she quickly moves on to the episode dealing with
1686100	1688100	overpopulation and carbon footprint and
1688100	1690100	what to do about it. Someone on the panel
1690100	1692100	talks about the much lower carbon footprint
1692100	1694100	of people in a non-Western country
1694100	1696100	and we get this, well, just
1696100	1698100	watch. How many does the
1698100	1700100	average American- I did that with my coffee
1700100	1702100	this morning. Yeah, 16
1702100	1704100	metric tons is what the average-
1704100	1706100	160 times. Yeah, yeah,
1706100	1708100	exactly. And so our two
1708100	1710100	kids are way more problematic.
1710100	1712100	The Nigerians with an average
1712100	1714100	7 children are not the problem when it comes to
1714100	1716100	climate change. The reason why they have
1716100	1718100	so many fucking kids is not because
1718100	1720100	they care about what's happening
1720100	1722100	with the environment. I'm pretty sure Botswana
1722100	1724100	over in Africa is not
1724100	1726100	popping out kids and thinking, it's okay,
1726100	1728100	I can have this seventh kid, it's sustainable,
1728100	1730100	it's okay, I'm not using all this
1730100	1732100	CO2, I'm not creating greenhouse gases.
1732100	1734100	No, they have kids
1734100	1736100	to fuel selfish ways
1736100	1738100	of getting them to look after them when
1738100	1740100	they're older. They have kids because they know
1740100	1742100	that child that they're popping out
1742100	1744100	right now will probably die from famine,
1744100	1746100	diseases, or both. Contraception
1746100	1748100	for them is out of the window anyway, I mean,
1748100	1750100	they don't even know how to put on a fucking condom.
1750100	1752100	I mean, can we really trust these people to take
1752100	1754100	a contraceptive pill every day? Can
1754100	1756100	we really? The answer is no.
1756100	1758100	This video took a fucking turn.
1758100	1760100	She takes the comment about the lower carbon footprint
1760100	1762100	of people in Western Africa
1762100	1764100	and just goes off on a rant about how stupid
1764100	1766100	and bad those people are, how they can't
1766100	1768100	be trusted to put on a condom.
1768100	1770100	She doesn't even appear to notice that the image
1770100	1772100	she's using to stereotype an entire
1772100	1774100	continent of people is literally
1774100	1776100	taken from the website
1776100	1778100	nationalstereotype.com.
1778100	1780100	So should we have policies that
1780100	1782100	penalize people for having extra
1782100	1784100	kids in the developed world?
1784100	1786100	Um, so I do think that
1786100	1787100	we should at least consider it.
1787100	1789100	Oh yeah, that's a great idea.
1789100	1791100	So let's get people in Western countries
1791100	1792100	to stop.
1792100	1794100	I'll let this unhinged rant continue
1794100	1796100	but let's just pause for a second and keep in mind
1796100	1798100	that what the guy actually said was
1798100	1800100	I think we should at least consider it.
1800100	1802100	Remember that she's this angry
1802100	1804100	about a very non-committal
1804100	1806100	comment about how we should maybe
1806100	1808100	at least think about it.
1808100	1810100	Remember that she's angry here
1810100	1812100	about the idea of
1812100	1814100	thinking about something.
1814100	1816100	Let's get people in Western countries
1816100	1818100	to stop having kids, you know,
1818100	1820100	the people that are actually solving
1820100	1822100	the problems with climate change, so then
1822100	1824100	people in the third world can overpopulate
1824100	1826100	us.
1828100	1830100	That's right, Rage After Storm's talking about
1830100	1832100	the Great Replacement, the easily
1832100	1834100	debunkable idea that foreigners are going to
1834100	1836100	take over the West by outbreeding
1836100	1838100	us because of differences in birth rates.
1838100	1840100	They were importing these third worlders
1840100	1842100	into Western countries like Germany
1842100	1844100	where the population is aging
1844100	1846100	and on a decline.
1846100	1848100	They're importing foreigners and they're going to take over.
1848100	1850100	She even uses the phrase replacement rate.
1850100	1852100	If you'd like to know more about this idea
1852100	1854100	and why it's total bullshit, actual
1854100	1856100	skepticism user and skull reclaimer
1856100	1858100	Sean Andjen did a video
1858100	1860100	debunking it handily. So handily
1860100	1862100	that it got false flagged and taken down
1862100	1864100	for a while by idiots because its existence
1864100	1866100	was inconvenient for them.
1866100	1868100	Check it out. Rage's version of the Great Replacement
1868100	1870100	is even less informed and
1870100	1872100	even more overtly racist than it
1872100	1874100	normally is. And by saying to the residents
1874100	1876100	of the third world, oh yeah no
1876100	1878100	you keep on having kids, you
1878100	1880100	are basically shooting yourself in the
1880100	1882100	foot. When I'm out and about
1882100	1884100	and I see people with loads of kids
1884100	1886100	it's either people that look like
1886100	1888100	they dance around wind turbines with hemp
1888100	1890100	sandals on or
1890100	1892100	people who aren't really Western Europeans.
1892100	1894100	She concludes that the solution
1894100	1896100	is education. And I guarantee you
1896100	1898100	the way to solve this issue is
1898100	1900100	by education. I agree.
1900100	1902100	Some people could certainly do
1902100	1904100	with knowing a bit more about the issues
1904100	1906100	before they open their mouth to dog whistle
1906100	1908100	about being replaced by immigrants.
1908100	1910100	Mwah, mwah.
1910100	1912100	Now some people who are watching this video might
1912100	1914100	genuinely think the Great Replacement is
1914100	1916100	real or otherwise nod along with
1916100	1918100	similar scaremongering about immigrants.
1918100	1920100	And I bet those people feel hard
1920100	1922100	done by right now. I can imagine that
1922100	1924100	free speech fan 1488
1924100	1926100	has already paused the video to go
1926100	1928100	you didn't actually debunk the Great Replacement
1928100	1930100	you just made fun of how completely
1930100	1932100	fucking unhinged it sounds.
1932100	1934100	She cited a newspaper article
1934100	1936100	to prove that she's
1936100	1938100	right. Why didn't you bother
1938100	1940100	to debunk that? You're ignoring it.
1940100	1942100	You're afraid of the truth. Well hold your
1942100	1944100	horses mate. Let's look at that
1944100	1946100	newspaper article in
1946100	1948100	more detail.
1948100	1950100	Shall we?
1950100	1952100	Luckily, to her credit, Rage After Storm
1952100	1954100	in the interest of transparency
1954100	1956100	has put a link to all of the sources that she used
1956100	1958100	in the description of the video
1958100	1960100	including links to where she got the Bill Nye
1960100	1962100	clips from, a bunch of newspaper
1962100	1964100	articles calling Bill Nye a full of shit
1964100	1966100	baby man who said the bad things
1966100	1968100	from places like...
1968100	1970100	The Federalist? Not a publication
1970100	1972100	I had heard of but that's alright.
1972100	1974100	Let's just click the link to that source
1974100	1976100	in the description and...
1976100	1978100	Oh. Weird.
1978100	1980100	That link isn't
1980100	1982100	in the description.
1982100	1984100	I wonder why.
1984100	1986100	Instead, I had to find it myself by
1986100	1988100	googling the title. Oh boy!
1988100	1990100	It's an article from the Telegraph.
1990100	1992100	That bastion of accurate political
1992100	1994100	reporting entitled
1994100	1996100	9 in 10 babies born in parts
1996100	1998100	of Britain have a foreign parent.
1998100	2000100	That's the title. Do yourself a favour and keep
2000100	2002100	in mind for a second the phrases
2002100	2004100	9 in 10 and
2004100	2006100	parts of Britain. Now, let's
2006100	2008100	read the first paragraph.
2008100	2010100	Almost 9 in 10 babies
2010100	2012100	born in parts of Britain have at least one
2012100	2014100	foreign-born parent, official figures
2014100	2016100	have revealed for the first time. Almost
2016100	2018100	9 in 10. Well, we've already
2018100	2020100	stepped back one from the headline.
2020100	2022100	Almost 9 in 10 is not 9 in 10.
2022100	2024100	At least parts of Britain hasn't
2024100	2026100	changed. Oh well, maybe it's some
2026100	2028100	big parts. That's still a lot of people
2028100	2030100	with foreign-born parents even if it was 8
2030100	2032100	in 10. How about we read the
2032100	2034100	second paragraph? The Office
2034100	2036100	for National Statistics disclosed that
2036100	2038100	in 2012, more than
2038100	2040100	80% of babies born in
2040100	2042100	three London boroughs
2042100	2044100	had either one or both parents born outside
2044100	2046100	the UK. Oh, some more
2046100	2048100	backpedalling. Almost 9 in 10
2048100	2050100	is actually more than 80%,
2050100	2052100	which they refuse to pin down with the
2052100	2054100	actual percentage. I wonder why.
2054100	2056100	Actually, I know why. It's because the number wasn't
2056100	2058100	convenient enough. And these foreign-born
2058100	2060100	parents' children are being born at this proportion
2060100	2062100	in three London
2062100	2064100	boroughs. Just...
2064100	2066100	just for those of you who don't know, London
2066100	2068100	has 32 boroughs.
2068100	2070100	The Telegraph found a very small
2070100	2072100	part of Britain with a high relative
2072100	2074100	birth rate among foreign-born parents
2074100	2076100	and fudged the numbers enough to get
2076100	2078100	an attention-grabbing headline to make it look like
2078100	2080100	we're being swarmed by immigrant babies.
2080100	2082100	What they actually did was draw a very
2082100	2084100	small circle around a part of the country
2084100	2086100	where a lot more immigrants live than the native-born
2086100	2088100	population. The figures were published
2088100	2090100	amid concerns that hundreds of thousands of
2090100	2092100	migrants from Romania and Bulgaria
2092100	2094100	could come to Britain when restrictions
2094100	2096100	are lifted in the new year.
2096100	2098100	Wait. Those aren't the places
2098100	2100100	Rage was talking about. Rage was talking
2100100	2102100	about people from Africa, and The Great Replacement
2102100	2104100	is all about diagrams of maps full of
2104100	2106100	little black people, overwhelming little white people,
2106100	2108100	and websites pushing it tell
2108100	2110100	lies about native women being encouraged
2110100	2112100	to procreate with African men.
2112100	2114100	This Telegraph article is scaremongering
2114100	2116100	about very different groups from the current
2116100	2118100	targets, who tend to be from more
2118100	2120100	brown, Muslim-y countries.
2120100	2122100	That's because Rage is citing an article
2122100	2124100	from 2013, back when the immigration
2124100	2126100	restrictions were set to be lifted, and
2126100	2128100	many totally smart people feared
2128100	2130100	we'd be flooded so heavily with
2130100	2132100	Romanians and Bulgarians
2132100	2134100	that the country would literally collapse back
2134100	2136100	into the ocean from the added weight,
2136100	2138100	which, as we all know, literally happened.
2138100	2140100	Just kidding. This reasonable
2140100	2142100	rational thinker who thinks they've out-scienced
2142100	2144100	Bill Nye tried to scaremonger
2144100	2146100	about immigration from the wrong place
2146100	2148100	than the one they're talking about
2148100	2150100	by citing the headline of a three-year-old article
2150100	2152100	that all but admits it's completely
2152100	2154100	misrepresenting the actual data a few
2154100	2156100	paragraphs in. Hey, look!
2156100	2158100	I think we figured out why she didn't bother linking
2158100	2160100	it in the description. Also note that
2160100	2162100	when she does show the text of the article,
2162100	2164100	it's blurred, so you can't pause it
2164100	2166100	and check to see how heavily
2166100	2168100	distorted the article is being
2168100	2170100	with the truth. Weird how she
2170100	2172100	knew to do that.
2172100	2174100	Almost as if she knows the source is full of shit,
2174100	2176100	but didn't think anyone
2176100	2178100	would bother to check.
2178100	2180100	Now, if you're anything like me, and I certainly hope
2180100	2182100	not, you're probably wondering why,
2182100	2184100	of all the articles to cite about
2184100	2186100	immigration and overpopulation,
2186100	2188100	why she would pick such an old one
2188100	2190100	scaremongering about immigration from a different
2190100	2192100	place? Like, why of all things
2192100	2194100	would this article or its data
2194100	2196100	form the basis for her claims?
2196100	2198100	Let's assume that you're gullible and you've been
2198100	2200100	tricked into believing the lie that foreigners
2200100	2202100	are coming to outbreed you, and you're so
2202100	2204100	sure it's right that you don't feel the need to do
2204100	2206100	any research, but you know you need to look
2206100	2208100	like you did to seem credible, so you'd
2208100	2210100	need a news story to flash up that looks
2210100	2212100	like it supports you. How would you find
2212100	2214100	an article that suits your needs? Well,
2214100	2216100	if it was me, I would Google something
2216100	2218100	ridiculous like, too many foreign
2218100	2220100	babies, and pick the one with the most
2220100	2222100	attention-getting headline that also looks like
2222100	2224100	it did some actual statistical
2224100	2226100	analysis. You know, like maybe the fourth
2226100	2228100	one down, even. This attitude to
2228100	2230100	science, studies, information,
2230100	2232100	and facts is probably
2232100	2234100	one of the many reasons why Rage and others
2234100	2236100	found Nye's recent work so baffling.
2236100	2238100	It appears that many people, without ever actually
2238100	2240100	checking anything, have already decided
2240100	2242100	what the truth is about issues of
2242100	2244100	gender, or immigration, or global
2244100	2246100	warming. Speaking of denying the
2246100	2248100	science of climate change, I made a joke
2248100	2250100	about Steven Crowder in the last video, and a
2250100	2251100	bunch of people went,
2251100	2253100	ooh, is he gonna do Crowder next?
2253100	2255100	And I hate to disappoint my
2255100	2257100	fan, so let's take
2257100	2259100	a look at some of Stevie's work about Nye's
2259100	2261100	recent work.
2261100	2263100	That's an awfulâ€”retake that. Let's have a look at some
2263100	2265100	of Stevie's recent work about Nye's
2265100	2267100	recentâ€”I saidâ€”I did it again.
2267100	2269100	I've saved myself the job of really having to
2269100	2271100	go through his claims about the gender episode, because
2271100	2273100	I've covered all the main ones already,
2273100	2275100	and as we've already covered, these people
2275100	2277100	have a habit of repeating each other's points.
2277100	2279100	He wasâ€”he wasâ€”he's making the case that
2279100	2281100	gender exists on a spectrum. By the way, very different if you go back
2281100	2283100	to his old show, he did say that chromosomes determine gender.
2283100	2285100	If you go back to the episodes when we were a kid.
2285100	2287100	So he's done a one-eighth down there.
2287100	2289100	So instead, I'll point out that his real beef
2289100	2291100	with Nye comes from how Bill's vocal about
2291100	2293100	climate change and doing something about it,
2293100	2295100	and Crowder is sure that the science doesn't
2295100	2297100	support man-made climate change, and he has
2297100	2299100	some counter-arguments that he's sure are good.
2299100	2301100	And then you have evidence, and the evidence
2301100	2303100	disagrees with your worldview, so you deny
2303100	2305100	the evidence, and then along with that,
2305100	2307100	you deny the authorities that are providing
2307100	2309100	the evidence. You will not deny the
2309100	2311100	authorities. Now, we're going to be talkingâ€”
2311100	2313100	Eee! A talk in a
2313100	2315100	German voice authoritarian joke.
2315100	2317100	Why, that's almost as good
2317100	2319100	as knowing the science!
2319100	2321100	Uh, who wants to take a bet with me that
2321100	2323100	at some point, he's recently made a video
2323100	2325100	accusing the left of calling everyone
2325100	2327100	Nazis and how unproductive that is?
2327100	2329100	Just kidding. I've seen more than
2329100	2331100	one of his videos, so I know he does that.
2331100	2333100	The left has been so busy
2333100	2335100	calling everyone Nazis.
2335100	2337100	Who would dare invoke
2337100	2339100	needless comparison to the Nazis?
2339100	2341100	What sort of imbecile
2341100	2343100	would dare do
2343100	2345100	something like that? Ah, no,
2345100	2347100	he's just talking authoritatively in a
2347100	2349100	German voice. That's not necessarily
2349100	2351100	invoking comparison to the Nazis
2351100	2353100	for political points.
2353100	2355100	Completely unrelatedly, just, you know,
2355100	2357100	nothing to do with the last sentence,
2357100	2359100	here's a segment from a video that he did
2359100	2361100	about Nye on climate change.
2361100	2363100	Now, everybody, science is
2363100	2365100	political. Science is political.
2365100	2367100	Incorrect. First, let me
2367100	2369100	draw your attention to the definition of science.
2369100	2371100	The intellectual and
2371100	2373100	practical activity... Oh my god.
2373100	2375100	I forgot that he actually cites
2375100	2377100	the dictionary definition of science
2377100	2379100	to try and avoid
2379100	2381100	accepting the basic fact that, like,
2381100	2383100	in order to stop the world from
2383100	2385100	melting down, scientists might
2385100	2387100	have to try and influence policy.
2387100	2389100	Wait, wait, wait, no, this gets worse, doesn't it?
2389100	2391100	Merging politics and science, not allowing
2391100	2393100	them to exist autonomously of each other
2393100	2395100	can only serve to alter
2395100	2397100	science's trajectory to the path of truth.
2397100	2399100	Okay? That's the main purpose here, and
2399100	2401100	Nye wants that specifically. Some examples?
2401100	2403100	I know it seems tired and old hat, but
2403100	2405100	let's go to Nazi Germany. That's kind of
2405100	2407100	a prime example of political science.
2407100	2409100	It also, of course, led to guessing
2409100	2411100	a few individuals.
2411100	2413100	You heard me right. If scientists try
2413100	2415100	to make the government listen to the
2415100	2417100	effects of global warming and do something about it,
2417100	2419100	it's the same as the Holocaust.
2419100	2421100	With Steven Crowder, it's honestly
2421100	2423100	a laugh a minute, watching him flip-flop between
2423100	2425100	comparing everyone he doesn't like to the Nazis
2425100	2427100	and their genocides, and complaining
2427100	2429100	that way too many people are comparing
2429100	2431100	things to the Nazis nowadays, especially those
2431100	2433100	leftists, who are the only ones
2433100	2434100	that do it.
2434100	2436100	But where are the other scientists speaking up?
2436100	2438100	Kind of like with Islam.
2438100	2440100	You know, we say, where are the Muslims speaking up
2440100	2442100	against the acts of terrorism? Not only against terrorismâ€”
2442100	2444100	Weird how in the same video, where Crowder
2444100	2446100	goes from saying how dangerous
2446100	2448100	political science was to the Jews,
2448100	2450100	he then, for seemingly no reason,
2450100	2452100	decides to start spreading the,
2452100	2454100	like, legit lie that
2454100	2456100	Muslims don't condemn terror attacks.
2456100	2458100	You know, I expected this video to
2458100	2460100	contain lies about Bill Nye and the science.
2460100	2462100	I did not expect it to contain lies
2462100	2464100	about Muslims. I guess when you
2464100	2466100	only have two talking points, you gotta
2466100	2468100	find a way to fit them in somehow, right?
2468100	2470100	You know, Steve, there are many gigantic lists
2470100	2472100	out there of Muslims and Muslim groups
2472100	2474100	that have come out against so-called
2474100	2476100	Islamic terror.
2476100	2478100	But I can't think of a single Muslim who's condemned
2478100	2480100	global warming. Coincidence?
2480100	2482100	Where are the Muslims speaking up
2482100	2484100	against the acts of terrorism?
2485100	2487100	It's very weird how he has to keep
2487100	2489100	quibbling about nonsense
2489100	2491100	instead of easily debunking
2491100	2493100	the data he says can be easily
2493100	2495100	debunked. And when he really does
2495100	2497100	get around to trying to actually debunk
2497100	2499100	climate science, when he's not saying
2499100	2501100	people wanting to do something about it are
2501100	2503100	Nazis, he's doing such a poor job
2503100	2505100	of debunking it that you don't even need
2505100	2507100	me to show you the flaws in his understanding.
2507100	2509100	Even racists can accept
2509100	2511100	climate change is a problem that begs a solution.
2511100	2513100	"...problem when it comes to climate change."
2513100	2515100	Yes, I agree that climate change
2515100	2517100	is an actual problem, and it needs to be
2517100	2519100	sorted out, and we do need to sort out
2519100	2521100	the consummation of electricity,
2521100	2523100	and thenâ€” I'm honestly really
2523100	2525100	quite stunned that in the middle of
2525100	2527100	a video complaining about the
2527100	2529100	bisexual agenda, spreading
2529100	2531100	racist lies,
2531100	2533100	scaremongering about immigration,
2533100	2535100	and whose description has to defend
2535100	2537100	the fact that she says Bill Nye
2537100	2539100	has a Jewish nose,
2539100	2541100	Lady Stormfront
2541100	2543100	still manages to have a better stance
2543100	2545100	on climate change than Stephen Crowder.
2545100	2547100	That's the lowest bar I've
2547100	2549100	ever seen, and
2549100	2551100	Crowdy Wowdy has just tripped
2551100	2553100	over it, and fallen into a well.
2553100	2555100	And it's not just rage that puts Crowder
2555100	2557100	to shame. If you want to see his claims get debunked
2557100	2559100	in more detail, there are many good videos
2559100	2561100	out there by the, uh, seminal
2561100	2563100	and personally inspirational Potholer54,
2563100	2565100	andâ€”
2565100	2567100	Armored Skeptic?!
2567100	2569100	...
2569100	2571100	Aw, that's right!
2571100	2573100	We just came full circle!
2573100	2575100	...the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain
2575100	2577100	of 112 billion
2577100	2579100	tons of ice per yearâ€”
2579100	2581100	But you didn't mention that there's also a net
2581100	2583100	loss for the entire planet.
2583100	2585100	Greenland also has a
2585100	2587100	major ice sheet. The total net
2587100	2589100	ice loss for Greenland is an
2589100	2591100	average of 269
2591100	2593100	billion tons of ice
2593100	2595100	every year. So the planet suffers
2595100	2597100	a net loss of
2597100	2599100	147 billion
2599100	2601100	tons of ice every year.
2601100	2603100	You see, Skeptic was wrong
2603100	2605100	about most of the issues he brought up about
2605100	2607100	Nye's show, because he doesn't really have
2607100	2609100	a grasp of the related science. But he's
2609100	2611100	right enough about climate science to know
2611100	2613100	Crowder's full of shit. The truly interesting
2613100	2615100	thing about Skeptic and those like him is
2615100	2617100	that if you pay attention, you can quite
2617100	2619100	easily discern the places where they've actually
2619100	2621100	decided to employ reason and
2621100	2623100	skepticism and proper fact-checking,
2623100	2625100	and the places where a sort of
2625100	2627100	party line has formed of the same
2627100	2629100	arguments repeating themselves over and over, but
2629100	2631100	no one's really thought about the
2631100	2633100	issue in that much detail. For
2633100	2635100	these people, ignoring the latter and the parts where
2635100	2637100	they just kind of complain about the SJWs,
2637100	2639100	the former can actually be quite
2639100	2641100	informative and interesting. Not
2641100	2643100	always, but quite often. This
2643100	2645100	schism is interesting, and the solution
2645100	2647100	isn't all that hard. It actually just means employing
2647100	2649100	reason and skepticism, but
2649100	2651100	even more, about even more
2651100	2653100	things. It would be nice if
2653100	2655100	he acknowledged the existence of
2655100	2657100	my video criticising him, or
2657100	2659100	even tried to respond
2659100	2661100	at all to the points
2661100	2663100	in it, but I know how long
2663100	2665100	this kind of thing can take. You've got to pick
2665100	2667100	what you cover with your time very carefully, or
2667100	2669100	nothing gets done, and I certainly can't criticise
2669100	2671100	anyone for doing what they think is right
2671100	2673100	with the time they have. For example, I've
2673100	2675100	spent nearly two months of my life
2675100	2677100	reading data and
2677100	2679100	biology books
2679100	2681100	and studies about trans
2681100	2683100	people, and reading about the lived
2683100	2685100	experiences of being trans in order to
2685100	2687100	come to a better understanding before broaching this
2687100	2689100	topic and responding to criticism,
2689100	2691100	before realising that most of the criticism
2691100	2693100	didn't do any research, and
2693100	2695100	there was really no reason
2695100	2697100	for me to do most of that reading,
2697100	2699100	and I've had basically no
2699100	2701100	chances to show all the work
2701100	2703100	I did in this video, and I'm thoroughly
2703100	2705100	disappointed in myself.
2705100	2707100	I accidentally took the time to educate
2707100	2709100	myself, to no benefit other than
2709100	2711100	my own personal expansion of knowledge,
2711100	2713100	like some kind of loser who
2713100	2715100	thinks that's important, and
2715100	2717100	to think I did all that just
2717100	2719100	to respond to videos
2719100	2721100	covering an episode of a show that I didn't think
2721100	2723100	was very good at covering the issues anyway.
2723100	2725100	I want to close by focusing on a section
2725100	2727100	of that episode that a lot of people complained
2727100	2729100	about, probably because it rightfully made them
2729100	2731100	feel uncomfortable, because
2731100	2733100	it made me feel a bit uncomfortable too.
2733100	2735100	So I'm gonna ask for a little help with that, and who
2735100	2737100	better to talk about sex than two
2737100	2739100	cis male
2739100	2741100	white guys?
2741100	2743100	It sat with me because I really
2743100	2745100	can't avoid what it's pointing out.
2745100	2747100	I can talk all day about whatever the right way
2747100	2749100	to discuss or present these issues might be,
2749100	2751100	but at the end of that day, I will still
2751100	2753100	be an outsider to those issues.
2753100	2755100	I was deeply curious what the opinion
2755100	2757100	of someone who's actually affected by these issues
2757100	2759100	might be about the show, so
2759100	2761100	I reached out to trans YouTuber Zinnia Jones
2761100	2763100	for her perspective on the issues, and
2763100	2765100	she sent me this. Let's watch.
2765600	2767600	Hi, I'm Zinnia Jones.
2767600	2769600	I'm a trans woman, and I've been
2769600	2771600	covering transgender issues on YouTube
2771600	2773600	for several years. Personally,
2773600	2775600	I enjoyed Bill Nye's presentation
2775600	2777600	of the spectrum of gender and sexuality.
2777600	2779600	As a trans person, I've often found coverage
2779600	2781600	of these topics for a cisgender audience
2781600	2783600	to be oversimplified or
2783600	2785600	awkward, but this episode
2785600	2787600	was surprisingly painless and even
2787600	2789600	charming, and it offered a nuanced
2789600	2791600	explanation of human diversity that's
2791600	2793600	sadly lacking in most media.
2794100	2796100	I was glad to see such a high-profile presentation
2796100	2798100	of concepts that I and other
2798100	2800100	trans advocates have been raising
2800100	2802100	awareness of for years, such as
2802100	2804100	the decoupling of gender from sex
2804100	2806100	and the recognition of non-binary genders.
2806100	2808100	The use of gender expression
2808100	2810100	in South Korea's culture was
2810100	2812100	a great concrete example of how
2812100	2814100	our ideas about gender can be actively
2814100	2816100	shaped by societal influences,
2816100	2818100	and I felt that the ice cream segment
2818100	2820100	was pretty effective in connecting
2820100	2822100	sexuality to something that people can
2822100	2824100	viscerally understand in their lives.
2824100	2826100	Being told that your favorite flavor of ice cream
2826100	2828100	is wrong would
2828100	2830100	make no sense, and as they
2830100	2832100	depicted, the people who feel the need
2832100	2834100	to try and rewrite their sexual orientation
2834100	2836100	do tend to end up
2836100	2838100	in some very queer situations.
2838100	2840100	As someone who loved watching Bill Nye
2840100	2842100	as a kid, I'll admit it was a bit strange
2842100	2844100	to hear a song about handjobs
2844100	2846100	and powerbombs, but
2846100	2848100	on the whole, I think this episode is
2848100	2850100	a good introduction for people who may
2850100	2852100	not be aware of what we now know
2852100	2854100	about the full range of gender and sexuality.
2854100	2856100	Um.
2856100	2858100	When I
2858100	2860100	went to find an alternative
2860100	2862100	perspective, I
2862100	2864100	had kind of banked on it
2864100	2866100	kind of semi-resembling the one
2866100	2868100	I'd had. Like, it would have been
2868100	2870100	really convenient for me if I could end the video
2870100	2872100	with, hey, remember what I thought about
2872100	2874100	the episode? Well, here's someone who knows way more
2874100	2876100	about the issue, and they agree with me!
2876100	2878100	But no, it turns out my perspective
2878100	2880100	can be flawed. I think Zinnia makes
2880100	2882100	an interesting point that I completely missed.
2882100	2884100	Ultimately, Bill Nye's doing
2884100	2886100	what Bill Nye has always done. Provide
2886100	2888100	a rudimentary, baseline explanation
2888100	2890100	of a topic to an audience whose science
2890100	2892100	education may well have ended in high
2892100	2894100	school. Like when we discussed
2894100	2896100	the act of writing an episode of this
2896100	2898100	show earlier, pointing this out
2898100	2900100	puts a lot of this episode in perspective.
2900100	2902100	Nye's show is for such a broad audience
2902100	2904100	of folks who may not know anything
2904100	2906100	about the topic. In a way,
2906100	2908100	the only people who this episode isn't
2908100	2910100	for are people who already
2910100	2912100	think a lot about the topic,
2912100	2914100	people who live the topic because it's a part
2914100	2916100	of their daily lives, and
2916100	2918100	of course, people who think that by
2918100	2920100	simply thinking about this issue too
2920100	2922100	much, you've taken the wrong side
2922100	2924100	in a culture war, something
2924100	2926100	something liberal agenda, blah
2926100	2928100	blah, too pro-gay.
2928100	2930100	Now, at this point, I am
2930100	2932100	contractually obliged to mention that exposure
2932100	2934100	to this video directly may make you up to
2934100	2936100	15% more gay, so
2936100	2938100	it's highly recommended that you wear your
2938100	2940100	ideological protection goggles provided
2940100	2942100	underneath your siâ€”hang on a second.
2942100	2944100	Why is this written at the end of the script?
2950100	2952100	Hey there, thanks for watching.
2952100	2954100	I'd like to thank Horikawa Otone for
2954100	2956100	letting me butcher her name like that
2956100	2958100	and also for help with the research that went
2958100	2960100	into making this video. If there's any mistakes,
2960100	2962100	it's because I forgot to run them past her.
2962100	2964100	I'd also like to thank Zinnia Jones for recording
2964100	2966100	her contribution, that was very nice of her,
2966100	2968100	and also ContraPoints for recording that one
2968100	2970100	line, which she did on incredibly short
2970100	2972100	notice, like the day before this video was
2972100	2974100	gonna come out. Thank you very much for that, Contra.
2974100	2976100	Most of the music used in this video,
2976100	2978100	including the song you're hearing right now,
2978100	2980100	was created by Krista Lee from her album
2980100	2982100	Fantasy Zone, a tribute to the music of
2982100	2984100	various Sega games. It's on Bandcamp,
2984100	2986100	check it out, link in the description.
2986100	2988100	And, finally, thanks
2988100	2990100	to all my lovely patrons for enabling
2990100	2992100	me. In addition to the names going past the screen
2992100	2994100	right now, I'd especially like to thank
2994100	2996100	three-fifths of a brain,
2996100	2998100	a bunch of question marks, I hope that's not an error
