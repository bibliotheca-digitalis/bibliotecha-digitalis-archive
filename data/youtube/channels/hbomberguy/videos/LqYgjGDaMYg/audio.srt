1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,160
Ah, it's good to be back.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,160
When we last left off, I performed raw, hardcore, mostly uncensored analysis of all of Armored

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,360
Skeptic's data supporting his view of gender expression.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,380
Which didn't take too long, because he didn't have any.

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,900
This time, we're gonna do some more of that, about some more people.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,940
Nothing particularly unique this time, I just thought it'd be nice to cover a few more people.

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,260
I wanted to do more last time, but the video started to feel like it was dragging, y'know?

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,220
Let's have another look and see if there are any decent rebuttals to Nye's recent work.

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,660
We'll be looking for a couple of basic things, like if the arguments actually hold water

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,500
when you look at them, uh, if they have any, uh, sources or data that they cite, if they

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,340
put it in the description, so people can click to check if it's actually right or not.

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,500
Uh, y'know, really basic stuff like that.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I'm sure that's a low bar that no one will be tripped over, right?

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
WHO'S FIRST?

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
[â™ª intro music â™ª

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,100
BOOM

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,100
Well, there's this Mouthy Buddha guy.

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,100
His attempts to criticize Rachel Bloom's musical segment caused him to devolve into screaming

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,100
MY PUSSY over and over until he was literally just reverberating and pulling a stupid face.

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
MY PUSSY!

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,100
MY PUSSY! MY PUSSY TALKS!

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
MY PUSSY!

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
MY PUSSY!

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
He seems like a lovely individual.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,100
He's using the very popular rhetorical strategy of acting like a fucking idiot and then saying

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
THAT'S WHAT I THINK FEMINISM IS!

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
ME BEING STUPID PROVES THEY'RE STUPID!

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,100
I put some jokes at his expense in the last video, and I thought it would be funny to just use

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,100
that clip of him doing that and then not go back to him ever again.

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,100
But even if I wanted to do more than that, I'd have some trouble because the video is mostly

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,100
just him whining about how morally evil it is that Rachel Bloom empowered ignorant women,

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,100
and how betrayed he feels by Bill Nye for not saying what he decided was true about the issue.

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Dude, name the smartest people in the world.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,100
They all think this gender fluidity shit is BULLSHIT!

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,100

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,100
No evidence is necessary to support his beliefs, apparently.

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,100
Who is this empowering?

41
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
It's empowering ignorant women!

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,100
People that you are dancing with are making our civilized western culture

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,100
more and more degenerate every day.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,100
I thought feminists were worthless and unproductive members of society,

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,100
but according to genius non-foot shooter Mouthy Buddha,

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,100
it turns out that actually, western civilization is so weak and vulnerable

47
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,100
that Rachel Bloom can destroy it with a song about her vagina.

48
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Listen, mate, if you think our great civilization is that weak,

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
maybe you should move somewhere else.

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Presumably back to the spitting image puppet dimension.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,100
His other videos try really hard to be dramatic pseudo-documentaries

52
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,100
with text effects, ornate fonts, and important sounding music

53
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,100
as he talks in a dramatic voice about how IQ is totally a real measurement

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
of human ability and behavior.

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,100
We need to understand the validity of IQ

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,100
to know that this is real and predictive of human behavior.

57
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,100
ðŸŽ¶

58
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
You know, for someone who seems incredibly certain

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,100
that IQ is a valid and important unit of measuring a person's intelligence,

60
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Mouthy Buddha doesn't appear to have listed his own IQ anywhere.

61
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,100
I invite you to come to the one conclusion there can be

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
about why he wouldn't do that.

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,100
These videos attempt to create the illusion that he's smart

64
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,100
and needs to be taken seriously, but he's already put out a video

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
where he whines and vibrates at a camera,

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
so the genie's out of the bottle there, mate.

67
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
While I could point and laugh at how he's a libertarian

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
trying desperately to backpedal from supporting the alt-right

69
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
after realizing that his bedfellows don't seem to realize

70
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
that eugenics is unethical,

71
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,100
or pretend that his other work means he's worth taking seriously,

72
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
I think it would be funnier not to.

73
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Who's next?

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Do you have any idea how reputationally damning this is?

75
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Well, there's this guy who calls himself SomeBlackGuy.

76
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
His video's entitled,

77
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
"'Bill Nye Ruins My Childhood.'"

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Oh dear, did the science man hurt your feelings?

79
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,100
But I thought rational people put facts over feelings.

80
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

81
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Bill Nye is now diving into the magical fantasy land

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
of progressive identity politics,

83
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
and he's doing it by, uh, his show,

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
uh, Bill Nye Saves the World,

85
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,100
and I've only seen bits and pieces of it,

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
and I-I-I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna watch it all the way through.

87
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Oh, great.

88
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Not only has he not actually seen the show,

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
just the cherry-picked chunks that ended up on YouTube,

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
he doesn't even plan on watching it.

91
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Points for honesty, I guess.

92
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
For most of the video, he plays clips

93
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
from the scant bits he has seen

94
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,100
and pauses them to cut away and try and make a clever riff.

95
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Standard cutaway commentary stuff.

96
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
But it's actually a lot sexier than that.

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
I don't know about you guys,

98
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
but there's absolutely nothing sexy about this whatsoever.

99
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Heh.

100
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Bill said it was sexy for a joke,

101
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,100
and the audience laughed along because it was a joke,

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,100
but Derek says it isn't very sexy at all.

103
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Oh, my God, he's got him.

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
He's owning him online with discourse.

105
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Can you feel the logic and reason yet?

106
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
And then for the rest of the video,

107
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
he extemporizes about the horrifying state of the world

108
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
now that some people identify as non-binary.

109
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
And now you have a bunch of people that,

110
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
that just wanna be heard.

111
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
They want, they don't wanna be normal.

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
They wanna, they wanna live in this fantasy world

113
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
where there's all these different options and shit.

114
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Oh, no!

115
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
People want to have options now.

116
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Like, you're starting to see on, on websites

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
where they have multiple options for gender

118
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
where it was just always man or woman.

119
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Now there's like, oh, fuck that.

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
No, I'm, no.

121
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Non-binary or something else should be an option.

122
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm like, why?

123
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
It's not that fucking serious, dude.

124
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
I mean, I know to a lot of people it is,

125
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,100
but in, in, in, in the, in the grand scale of things,

126
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
this is extremely trivial.

127
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I agree, it is extremely trivial.

128
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
When someone comes up to me and says,

129
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I'd rather you refer to me by these pronouns from now on.

130
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
I say, yeah, all right,

131
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
because it's really not that hard,

132
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,100
and it doesn't really affect my life all that much.

133
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Oh, no, sorry, you meant the other kind of trivial.

134
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
The kind where you spend days of your life

135
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,100
recording YouTube videos, complaining about it

136
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,100
while insisting that it's trivial.

137
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Sure.

138
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
I asked for a little help with that,

139
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
and who better to talk about sex

140
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,100
than two...sexy...

141
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,100
two...cis-male white guys?

142
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
This dude has fallen off the deep end.

143
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Why couldn't these people,

144
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
why couldn't Bill Nye or anybody,

145
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
any cis white man,

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
or just a, a cis male for, for,

147
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
talk about this type of stuff?

148
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Like, why is this even mentioned?

149
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Why would you say that?

150
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
It, it, like, how is that even funny?

151
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
My favorite part of this clip is that he realizes

152
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
at the very end, asking these dumbass questions

153
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
about why would you dare say that,

154
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
that Bill was just making a joke,

155
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
so he suddenly cuts himself off and goes,

156
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
how is that even funny?

157
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Like, you can see the moment he realizes

158
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
that maybe Bill Nye's sentence

159
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
shouldn't be taken literally seriously,

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
but he can't admit he fucked up,

161
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
so he just cuts himself off and goes,

162
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
well, I wasn't funny either.

163
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Nye wasn't saying that cis male white guys

164
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
aren't allowed to talk about sex,

165
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
because they are.

166
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
They continue to do so after making the joke.

167
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
I'm really surprised by how easily

168
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
these folks are tripped by jokes.

169
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Now, I could just systematically own Derek

170
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
for all the stupid shit he says

171
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
over the course of the video,

172
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
but I've set myself the lofty goal

173
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
of cutting through the chaff

174
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
and analyzing the core claims themselves

175
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
that appear to be holding up the rest of the rants

176
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,100
and seeing if at least they hold water.

177
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
You know, all this bullshit is bullshit,

178
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
but he might have a point in there somewhere,

179
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,100
so I did some digging and found Derek's central claim,

180
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
which is that Bill Nye has gone against the science,

181
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
and he knows this is what's happened

182
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
because real scientists used to say otherwise.

183
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
But now he wants to play make-believe

184
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
and say stuff like,

185
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,100
oh, gender is on a spectrum like sex, you know?

186
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
There's such a thing as, like, non-binary

187
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
and stuff like that when, you know,

188
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
before, like, any other science, uh,

189
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
or scientist that has come before him

190
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
has just said there's two genders

191
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
and they're determined by the chromosomes.

192
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Chromosomes?

193
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Whatever, he probably misspoke.

194
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
He doesn't provide any data or studies

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,100
to support the idea that gender is determined by chromosomes,

196
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
but he also doesn't even dare say that himself.

197
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Instead, he says,

198
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
well, scientists say it,

199
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
and he believes those scientists over Bill

200
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,100
because, well, they say what he thinks is true.

201
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Certainly not because he's seen the evidence himself

202
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
because then he'd have bothered to show it to the viewer

203
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
and not hide behind,

204
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
scientists say it, wouldn't he?

205
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
The funny thing is he tries and fails

206
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
to claim that this is what Bill used to say.

207
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
This next clip is unintentionally amazing.

208
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Something that he said himself as well.

209
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
In an act of utter hilarity,

210
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
after saying this used to be what Bill said himself,

211
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
he cuts to a scene from an old episode of Science Guy

212
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,100
where someone who is definitely not Bill himself

213
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
explains chromosomes.

214
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Before you're born,

215
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
your mom gives you one of her chromosomes

216
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
and your dad gives you one of his.

217
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Now, we're gonna investigate that claim

218
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
in a little more detail in a sec,

219
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,100
but first, let's stop and think like video editors for a bit.

220
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Look, it's my one actual area of expertise.

221
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I was gonna shoehorn this bit in somewhere.

222
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm going to be charitable here

223
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,100
and assume that Derek did some research in advance.

224
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
He probably at least watched some of the clips

225
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
from the ice cream bit or the musical bit

226
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
that people were spreading on YouTube

227
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
and saw people claiming on Twitter

228
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
that Nye used to say genders caused by chromosomes

229
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
and then hit record assuming Bill had actually said it.

230
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Now, the question is,

231
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
why would he think Bill had actually said it himself

232
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
in the first place?

233
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
He must have got this idea from somewhere.

234
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Well, in the spheres Derek runs in,

235
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
a very popular image was circulating on Twitter

236
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,100
with a picture of Bill holding up a diagram of chromosomes

237
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
with subtitles claiming they decide a person's gender.

238
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
These subtitles were fake.

239
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Nye said nothing of the sort in that actual segment.

240
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
The image was spread by noted bastion of truth

241
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
and ant enthusiast Ian Miles Chong

242
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
in the hopes of convincing gullible idiots,

243
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
and, well, evidently it did.

244
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
It appears that Derek here took it for granted

245
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
that that was what Bill had said

246
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
and didn't even check it was true until after recording,

247
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
so he had to use this clip of someone else

248
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
saying something that you could twist

249
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
to be about gender instead.

250
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Now, I'm just spitballing here.

251
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,100
There's no way of proving that's the exact chain of events.

252
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Uh, Derek could have just missed

253
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
the widely shared lie

254
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
tweeted by Chong,

255
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
who he follows on Twitter,

256
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
and which was originally tweeted

257
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
just minutes before Derek tweeted,

258
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
why is Bill Nye all over my feed?

259
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
You know, it could have been a different chain of events,

260
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
but it wasn't.

261
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Now, I'm not saying Derek saw a fake screenshot

262
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
and took it as fact without checking

263
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
and that this is antithetical to the very principles

264
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
he claims Bill Nye has abandoned,

265
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
but it certainly looks exactly like that.

266
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
However, let's ignore this blatant ignorance

267
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
and hypocrisy and talk a little about the segment

268
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
he did end up using, featuring someone

269
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
who isn't Bill Nye talking about chromosomes.

270
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
This clip is also widely used elsewhere

271
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
to claim Nye's previous show was right

272
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
and then he got infected by feminism or something.

273
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Derek contrasts this old clip from 1996

274
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
with his present stance on the issue in his new show.

275
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Many months later...

276
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
I used to think there were just two settings,

277
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
male and female.

278
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
At least you actually had a clip of Bill talking

279
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
about the issue this time, Derek.

280
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
The implication, of course, is that Nye has abandoned

281
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
the science and become a liar,

282
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
but this reflects a very poor understanding

283
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
of the absolute basics of Bill Nye's old show

284
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
and how it was constructed primarily

285
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,100
to give children a baseline understanding

286
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
of science in the 90s.

287
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
The old show, I hate to point out,

288
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
never really did cover sex, gender,

289
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,100
or sexuality in much detail, if at all.

290
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Covering these issues on a show for kids in the 90s

291
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
was pretty much off-limits.

292
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
You'd come under fire for indoctrinating children

293
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
into an evil agenda and other gay panic nonsense

294
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
bullshit garbage.

295
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
You know, the sort of thing similar

296
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Neo-Puritans would do in the modern day

297
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
if, let's say,

298
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
there was a YouTube channel aimed at educating kids

299
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
about these issues.

300
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I wonder why the producers wanted to avoid

301
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
the ire of Derek's ideological predecessors

302
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
and risk getting pulled from the air

303
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
or sent death threats.

304
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
They steered well clear and, to my knowledge,

305
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
only ever barely broached the subject

306
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
of sex differences when it's in relation

307
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
to something else.

308
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
The segment all the idiots are pointing to

309
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
is from an episode about probability.

310
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
No, not sex.

311
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Not here's an episode on how chromosomes work.

312
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Probability.

313
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Imagine for a moment that you're one of the writers of this show.

314
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Let's say you're writing an episode of a science show

315
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
about probability,

316
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
and you have 23 minutes to explain it to an audience,

317
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
and an example you want to give

318
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
is the probability of which sex you were born.

319
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
And if Dad gives you an X2,

320
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
then you become a girl.

321
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
But if he gives you his Y,

322
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
then you become a boy.

323
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Even though, because you know your stuff,

324
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
because you're a researcher for a show about science,

325
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
the science behind transgender people is known to you,

326
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
you're writing in an era where,

327
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
generally speaking, the terms

328
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
sex and gender are conflated in common parlance.

329
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
And you're writing a show for kids.

330
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
In fact, you're writing lines for an actual

331
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
kid to say, so you have her say,

332
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
if you have a Y chromosome, you're a boy

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
for convenience's sake.

334
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
You also wrote a funny skit where Bill picks the wrong door

335
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
to his lab and falls off the roof of a building.

336
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Huh? Oh, oh, oh, oh!

337
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Oh, boy.

338
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
See, there are only two possibilities.

339
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
You know, as a writer for the show,

340
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
that there's a probability of a person

341
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
being intersex or other rare

342
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
chromosomal differences that complicate this simple

343
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
one and two probability.

344
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
But you know that taking the time to explain this here

345
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
would mean cutting into the Wizard of Odds skit

346
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
where you reenact the Wizard of Oz

347
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
and Bill Nye is the Wizard.

348
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
If you want to improve the chances of getting home safely,

349
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
wear a seatbelt.

350
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
The chance of becoming either a boy or a girl

351
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
is always one in two.

352
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
A 50-50 chance either way.

353
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
It's like flipping a coin.

354
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Mm-hmm.

355
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
X, you're a girl. Y, you're a boy.

356
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
You also, because you're not an idiot,

357
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
have done more than five seconds of research

358
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
and know that the probability in most industrialized

359
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
nations of being born physically male

360
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
is generally higher than being born

361
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
physically female, so the chances are more like

362
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
1.05 in two, meaning

363
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
it's not like flipping a coin so much as like

364
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
flipping a coin that's very slightly weighted

365
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
as a result of complex environmental factors.

366
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
And there's also the rare but real

367
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
possibility of the coin landing on its side.

368
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
You don't bring this up either, because Bill

369
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
really doesn't want to cut the skit where he counts

370
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
dice possibilities next to the giant fan

371
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
he stole from the set of Blade Runner.

372
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
And since the video is boiling down probabilities

373
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
for children, you leave it out,

374
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
hoping people more discerning of the science

375
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
will understand why you left it out,

376
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
and privately, you pray that none of the

377
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
kids in the audience will grow up to call Bill Nye

378
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
a liar when he explains the more complicated

379
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
version to them as adults.

380
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Does he cite any sources to back up his claims

381
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
throughout the video? Why,

382
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
some black guy gives an exhaustingly

383
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
comprehensive list of his merch store,

384
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Patreon, PayPal,

385
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Second Channel, Twitch,

386
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Instagram, Ask.FM, Snapchat,

387
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
email, Grindr,

388
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Chimney, Splango,

389
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
et cetera, et cetera.

390
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Unfortunately, he doesn't cite any

391
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
sources because he doesn't have any to

392
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
back up his beliefs, but he feels

393
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
very strongly that he's right, and that's why

394
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
you should check out the t-shirts for sale in his

395
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
merch store. For example, this one about

396
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
how facts are more important than feelings.

397
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
And he's right. In making an

398
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
informed argument, facts are

399
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
important. Would have been

400
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
great if he'd had any, wouldn't it?

401
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Some black guy, more like

402
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
some lack of evidence

403
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
got, oh, cut that

404
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
out. That's just rubbish.

405
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I hope you're sick

406
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
of bullshit because here's YouTuber

407
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
No Bullshit with his video entitled

408
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Bill Nye Goes Full SJW

409
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Trashes Whites

410
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Praises Transgenders and Gays

411
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
and by no bullshit, I

412
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
apparently meant to say no sources.

413
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
I bet we're in for a real science

414
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
and research fest here.

415
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
...

416
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
...

417
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
...

418
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
I'm sick of people over

419
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
inflating the amounts of gay and transgender

420
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
people in the population, and I have nothing

421
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
against the people, don't get me wrong.

422
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm just sick of this overly gay, overly

423
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
pro-trans narrative being pushed

424
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
everywhere. Everywhere that toes the line with

425
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
the liberal SJW PC

426
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
crowd. It's gotten beyond annoying and

427
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
is verging into unsettling and disturbing

428
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
places. When I clicked a video

429
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
by someone called No Bullshit, I thought

430
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I was entering an intellectual thunderdome.

431
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
But so far, all he's done is

432
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
complain about the overly

433
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
gay, overly pro-trans

434
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
narrative that's being pushed

435
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
everywhere by the liberals. I thought

436
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
this was supposed to be about science,

437
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
but this guy's just sharing his feelings

438
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
about the liberals.

439
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
What is this? No Bullshit's whole deal

440
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
appears to be to pause during whatever

441
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
he's watching partway through to fantasize

442
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
about the deep, hidden

443
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
emotions or the evil agendas

444
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
of the people on screen.

445
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
God,

446
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
even the new theme song is shittier.

447
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
And it just screams, I'm desperate to be

448
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
cool and hip again. Here's a black guy singing

449
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
my theme song. I'm down.

450
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Now either Mr. Bullshit, if that is his real

451
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
name, which I'm going to assume it is,

452
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
can read minds, or he's just written

453
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
an elaborate fanfiction about

454
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Bill Nye wanting to look

455
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
hip, so he personally gets

456
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Tyler, the creator, to make the new theme.

457
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Because apparently no one else

458
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
is involved with the production of a show.

459
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
The man the camera's appointed at,

460
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
he personally writes it all.

461
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
He commissions everything that goes into the show.

462
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
He personally hires all the animators.

463
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
It's all Bill Nye. It's not like

464
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
there's a production crew or anything.

465
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Who better to talk about sex than two

466
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
cis-male

467
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
white guys?

468
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
And this is also where

469
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I lose all hope for the show.

470
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Anyone who uses the word cis is either an

471
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
MW whack job, or they're someone who's trying

472
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
to pander to them. If you hear someone say a

473
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
word you don't like, pause the video to

474
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
complain about how that makes them the bad

475
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
people. Bonus points if you

476
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
then go on to make videos complaining about how

477
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
everyone else is easily offended by words.

478
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
They pull it off with

479
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
so much confidence that it doesn't

480
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
feel weird, it just feels like, hey.

481
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
So now we jump to Veritasium on location

482
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
in Korea. And to be honest, listening

483
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
to this K-pop weirdo talk,

484
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
I feel the same way Veritasium looks.

485
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
He looks squinty. He's looking

486
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
down on this creeper, raising his upper lip

487
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
in disgust. He looks

488
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
squinty, and that means he's

489
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
looking down on the person he's interviewing.

490
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
He secretly hates them.

491
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
This Rachel Bloom bitch sounds like she's

492
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
trying to be the next Amy Schumer or something.

493
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
My vagina. My vagina.

494
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
No one cares about your gross vagina,

495
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
lady. I'm not gonna even touch those

496
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
frankly Freudian comments

497
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
about finding vaginas weird.

498
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Now as can be plainly seen, this

499
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
no-bullshit fellow doesn't really have any

500
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
understanding of the science and isn't all that bright

501
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
otherwise. So he doesn't even really

502
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
understand why he's so angry

503
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
that the show is too

504
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
pro-gay. So he wallpapers

505
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
over the cracks in his own understanding

506
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
by imagining that everyone

507
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
on screen is sad and

508
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
angry and hateful and wants to

509
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
look cool and is pushing an agenda

510
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
and is an evil liberal

511
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
and wants to be like Amy Schumer.

512
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Which doesn't really make any sense.

513
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
No one wants to be like Amy Schumer.

514
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Not even Amy Schumer wants to be like Amy Schumer.

515
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Now, if I

516
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
really wanted to, I could go

517
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
through the entire video and make one of my

518
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
patented, citation-needed

519
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
jokes every single time he makes

520
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
a claim and then doesn't support it with any

521
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
evidence whatsoever. This still doesn't

522
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
change the fact that there are only two genders.

523
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

524
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

525
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

526
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
But instead, I decided to take a leaf out of his book

527
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
and just imagine that he likes the smell of his own

528
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
farts and then move on without thinking about him too much.

529
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Ugh, we're running out of people

530
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
pretending they have compelling arguments.

531
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Quick! What about Previous Appearance Have a

532
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Red Pill Philosophy? The guy who couldn't even

533
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
remember the names of the main characters of

534
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
The Force Awakens in the car after getting out

535
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
of the theater? Maybe his video

536
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Bill Nye's Netflix Show

537
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Trashes White People, Glorifies

538
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Transge-

539
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Wait, haven't we seen that title before?

540
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
So it's like a game. You guys are

541
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
writing the same thing. I love that clip.

542
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
It's from Roosh complaining to some journalists

543
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
accusing them of secretly plotting to push

544
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
a unified narrative by writing

545
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
similar articles, as if there's a multitude

546
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
of ways of reporting about his legalized

547
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
rape article, but I like reusing

548
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
it in a better context of people in his

549
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
sphere copying each other's work.

550
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
I can't wait for them to start suing each other.

551
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Those court cases are gonna be hilarious.

552
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
But speaking of doing the same thing, at this point, I'm

553
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
starting to see a lot of repeat performances

554
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
of people plotting out the same arguments again and again

555
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
in new, even more uninformed

556
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
incarnations. We've got the

557
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
lecturing the white race argument.

558
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Some Indian dude came on

559
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
to Bill Nye's show

560
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
to lecture white people about cultural

561
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
appropriation! Prashant's

562
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
lectured the entire

563
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
white race on how it's unacceptable

564
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
to use Asian mysticism

565
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
because it's from a different culture.

566
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
You've got complaints that it's too political

567
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,100
to even talk about this stuff, or

568
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
outright fantasies of a secret liberal

569
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
agenda. Pushing leftist

570
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
liberal SJW narratives.

571
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
This episode is very clearly

572
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
politically driven. Oh, it's-it's-it's politics,

573
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
like, bringing the politics

574
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
into the science. And we've got the same sob

575
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
stories about how he used to like Bill, but

576
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
then he betrayed me! Bill Nye

577
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
is a childhood hero to a lot of people,

578
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
including myself. His television show

579
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Bill Nye the Science Guy was informative,

580
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
innovative, and entertaining.

581
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I was extremely excited

582
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
when Netflix announced that they'd be releasing

583
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
a brand new Bill Nye series.

584
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
You used to be a voice

585
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
for hard science.

586
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
When I was a child,

587
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
you were just this cool figure

588
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
for science. You are a representative

589
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
of science, and you just

590
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
shit over all of it! And of course

591
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
we've got the fantastic repeat performance

592
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
of not bothering to cite any sources or studies

593
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
to back up any of their claims.

594
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
At this point, my mind's a blur.

595
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
I can't honestly tell you what Red Pill Philosophy

596
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
said in his video, and the first time

597
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
I watched it, I wasn't sure if I'd somehow seen

598
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
it before and forgotten. I tried to re-watch

599
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
it and see if he says anything worth specifically

600
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
debunking, but my eyes just

601
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
slide off him and I start to think about

602
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
all the vacuuming I could be doing.

603
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Bill Nye, the establishment guy,

604
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
is nothing but an establishment

605
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
shill, nothing but

606
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
establishment propaganda. If you go

607
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
to the Twitter page of that March for

608
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Science, uh, Twitter page,

609
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
it's at establishment propaganda.

610
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Bill Nye, the propaganda

611
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
guy. Bill Nye, the

612
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
establishment guy.

613
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Um, so Bill Nye, the propaganda guy.

614
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Bill Nye, the establishment shill guy.

615
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
At this point in my

616
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
quest, I was desperate for someone,

617
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
anyone who had something different

618
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
to say. It didn't even have to be right.

619
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
At this point, a different set of wrong

620
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
arguments would have been enough to make me feel

621
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
alive again, and then

622
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
out of the darkness came

623
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Rage After Storm. Rage After Storm

624
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
is one of those YouTubers who

625
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
actively courts a far-right audience

626
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
and likes to talk about how race is real

627
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
and tweet about how Hitler had

628
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
some really good ideas. This video

629
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
is entitled Bill Nye, the

630
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Jewish guy.

631
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Please stop getting triggered over the Jew thing.

632
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
It's a reference to the nose.

633
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
It was just banter.

634
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
The video opens a little familiarly to begin with,

635
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
with the standard totally not-fabricated

636
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Bill Nye sob story. I loved

637
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
him, and it made me want to think about stuff,

638
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
but then he said the bad thing. Look, I know

639
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
that so many people are starting to catch this

640
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
SJW virus,

641
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
but I never knew that it would be my

642
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
dearest Bill. I respected

643
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
him so much. No, really, he was

644
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
my muse.

645
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
But then she goes off the fucking chain.

646
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
She one-ups Armored Skeptic's

647
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
ice cream slut shaming and begins trying

648
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
to figure out which sexualities the ice

649
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
creams represent in the comedy

650
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
ice cream cartoon. You have

651
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
vanilla, that's straight. One of the flavours then has to

652
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
be a lesbian. One of them has to be gay.

653
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
One of them has to be bisexual. Okay,

654
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
someone over here is a fucked

655
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
up ice cream. She's trying to fucking

656
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
diagnose cartoon ice creams.

657
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Which sexuality are you?

658
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
Let me get out my ice cream, Speculum.

659
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Hey, mint chocolate chip!

660
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Sorry I'm late. I was

661
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
busy being two awesome things at once.

662
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Okay, nope. Choco chip is

663
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
obviously bisexual. This is weird.

664
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Actually, chocolate chip is pretty

665
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
straightforwardly a metaphor for non-binary

666
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
or intersex people. You know,

667
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
being two awesome things

668
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
at once. Not enjoys licking

669
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
two different kinds of ice cream

670
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
at once. She can't even

671
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
pass the most basic point of the segment.

672
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
You're nuts.

673
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Can we not encourage

674
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
gangbangs, please? Can we teach people

675
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
a bit of decency? Having a gangbang

676
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
is not something to be proud of.

677
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Well, someone isn't invited to my

678
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
next house party, I can tell you.

679
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Not because of that, though. Because of

680
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
the Hitler apologetics.

681
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Again, this is exactly how STDs

682
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
spread. Being slutty is

683
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
not cool. No, being uneducated

684
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
about STDs and how they spread

685
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
is how they spread. Imagine that.

686
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
The real problem being

687
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
people being uneducated

688
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
on the issue. Imagine if that

689
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
was the real problem here.

690
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
So she continues to moral panic about how

691
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
the show is promoting being bi as cool

692
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
too much and how it's tricking people into

693
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
wanting to be bi, to be trendy. You know,

694
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
because that's how sexuality works.

695
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Just in general, why are we advertising the fact

696
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
that bisexuality is cool?

697
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
This isn't a particularly uncommon approach

698
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
to sexuality either. You see it everywhere

699
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
in conservative criticism of progressive media.

700
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Like with No Bullshit, the problem

701
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
isn't that LGBT people exist. Of course

702
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
not. They love gay people.

703
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
The problem is the overly

704
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
pro-LGBT narrative.

705
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
From their perspective, the issue

706
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
is people being too nice

707
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
about the bis, the

708
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
gyars, the lesbs

709
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
and the transes. And that

710
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
throws off the delicate balance

711
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
of nature or something.

712
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
They think these people are allowed to exist

713
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
and that's fine, that's okay. We've finally gotten

714
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
them that far. But

715
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
they have to exist in the background somewhere.

716
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
You can't accidentally make it look like

717
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
it's okay to be like that.

718
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Because that's basically just pushing

719
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
their agenda on people.

720
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
None of it is meant to be like a fashion

721
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
craze or a trend or something that's cool.

722
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Okay? It's not. This

723
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
provides people with pressure.

724
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Pressuring people into becoming bi

725
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
and having orgies? Is that

726
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
really what the cartoon ice cream

727
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
skit does to people?

728
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
This might just be my opinion, but I don't think many

729
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
people are going to have their sexuality changed

730
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
or their identity radically

731
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
altered by media

732
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
presenting it as okay to not

733
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
be straight or not be, I'm

734
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
going to say the bad word, cover your ears,

735
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
cisgendered. I'm at the risk

736
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
of sounding a little bit stubborn here, but I just

737
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
don't accept that people who are

738
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
secure in their own sexuality are going to have theirs

739
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
changed by other people being open

740
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
about their own. Which is why my conscience

741
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
will be clear when, at the end of this sentence,

742
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
I cut to a graphic depiction

743
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
of what I get up to in my bed every

744
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
single night.

745
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
I'm playing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

746
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
You can play it anywhere because it's

747
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
portable. It's a really good game,

748
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
guys. But don't get me wrong. That doesn't

749
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
mean that there aren't very positive effects

750
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
of having good representations

751
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
of LGBT people in media.

752
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
This kind of goes without saying, but generally speaking,

753
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
it's healthy for a person

754
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
to feel like they're allowed to express

755
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
themselves and their identity without

756
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,100
fear of not being accepted

757
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
or of being treated like they're lesser

758
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
as a result of it. Perceiving

759
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
positive representations of LGBT people

760
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
as some kind of insidious

761
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
trick is, academically

762
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
speaking, very

763
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
stupid. Versatile love

764
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
may have some butt stuff.

765
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Ew. I think that short clip of someone

766
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
saying butt stuff and cutting to her saying

767
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
ew sums up her coverage

768
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,100
of most of this episode. She seems to be

769
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
aware of how little she has to say, though,

770
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
so she quickly moves on to the episode dealing with

771
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
overpopulation and carbon footprint and

772
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
what to do about it. Someone on the panel

773
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
talks about the much lower carbon footprint

774
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
of people in a non-Western country

775
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
and we get this, well, just

776
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
watch. How many does the

777
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
average American- I did that with my coffee

778
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
this morning. Yeah, 16

779
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
metric tons is what the average-

780
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
160 times. Yeah, yeah,

781
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
exactly. And so our two

782
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
kids are way more problematic.

783
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
The Nigerians with an average

784
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
7 children are not the problem when it comes to

785
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
climate change. The reason why they have

786
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
so many fucking kids is not because

787
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
they care about what's happening

788
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
with the environment. I'm pretty sure Botswana

789
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
over in Africa is not

790
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,100
popping out kids and thinking, it's okay,

791
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
I can have this seventh kid, it's sustainable,

792
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
it's okay, I'm not using all this

793
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
CO2, I'm not creating greenhouse gases.

794
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
No, they have kids

795
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
to fuel selfish ways

796
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
of getting them to look after them when

797
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
they're older. They have kids because they know

798
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
that child that they're popping out

799
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
right now will probably die from famine,

800
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
diseases, or both. Contraception

801
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,100
for them is out of the window anyway, I mean,

802
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,100
they don't even know how to put on a fucking condom.

803
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I mean, can we really trust these people to take

804
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
a contraceptive pill every day? Can

805
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
we really? The answer is no.

806
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
This video took a fucking turn.

807
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
She takes the comment about the lower carbon footprint

808
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
of people in Western Africa

809
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
and just goes off on a rant about how stupid

810
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
and bad those people are, how they can't

811
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
be trusted to put on a condom.

812
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
She doesn't even appear to notice that the image

813
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
she's using to stereotype an entire

814
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
continent of people is literally

815
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
taken from the website

816
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
nationalstereotype.com.

817
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
So should we have policies that

818
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
penalize people for having extra

819
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
kids in the developed world?

820
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Um, so I do think that

821
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
we should at least consider it.

822
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

823
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
So let's get people in Western countries

824
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
to stop.

825
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
I'll let this unhinged rant continue

826
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
but let's just pause for a second and keep in mind

827
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
that what the guy actually said was

828
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
I think we should at least consider it.

829
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Remember that she's this angry

830
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
about a very non-committal

831
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
comment about how we should maybe

832
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
at least think about it.

833
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Remember that she's angry here

834
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
about the idea of

835
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
thinking about something.

836
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
Let's get people in Western countries

837
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
to stop having kids, you know,

838
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
the people that are actually solving

839
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
the problems with climate change, so then

840
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
people in the third world can overpopulate

841
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
us.

842
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100
That's right, Rage After Storm's talking about

843
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
the Great Replacement, the easily

844
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
debunkable idea that foreigners are going to

845
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
take over the West by outbreeding

846
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
us because of differences in birth rates.

847
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
They were importing these third worlders

848
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
into Western countries like Germany

849
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
where the population is aging

850
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
and on a decline.

851
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
They're importing foreigners and they're going to take over.

852
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
She even uses the phrase replacement rate.

853
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
If you'd like to know more about this idea

854
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
and why it's total bullshit, actual

855
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
skepticism user and skull reclaimer

856
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Sean Andjen did a video

857
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
debunking it handily. So handily

858
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
that it got false flagged and taken down

859
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
for a while by idiots because its existence

860
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
was inconvenient for them.

861
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Check it out. Rage's version of the Great Replacement

862
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
is even less informed and

863
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
even more overtly racist than it

864
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
normally is. And by saying to the residents

865
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
of the third world, oh yeah no

866
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
you keep on having kids, you

867
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
are basically shooting yourself in the

868
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
foot. When I'm out and about

869
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
and I see people with loads of kids

870
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
it's either people that look like

871
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
they dance around wind turbines with hemp

872
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
sandals on or

873
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
people who aren't really Western Europeans.

874
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
She concludes that the solution

875
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
is education. And I guarantee you

876
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
the way to solve this issue is

877
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
by education. I agree.

878
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Some people could certainly do

879
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
with knowing a bit more about the issues

880
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
before they open their mouth to dog whistle

881
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,100
about being replaced by immigrants.

882
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Mwah, mwah.

883
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Now some people who are watching this video might

884
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
genuinely think the Great Replacement is

885
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
real or otherwise nod along with

886
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
similar scaremongering about immigrants.

887
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
And I bet those people feel hard

888
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
done by right now. I can imagine that

889
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
free speech fan 1488

890
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
has already paused the video to go

891
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
you didn't actually debunk the Great Replacement

892
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
you just made fun of how completely

893
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
fucking unhinged it sounds.

894
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
She cited a newspaper article

895
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
to prove that she's

896
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
right. Why didn't you bother

897
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
to debunk that? You're ignoring it.

898
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
You're afraid of the truth. Well hold your

899
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
horses mate. Let's look at that

900
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
newspaper article in

901
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
more detail.

902
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Shall we?

903
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Luckily, to her credit, Rage After Storm

904
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
in the interest of transparency

905
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
has put a link to all of the sources that she used

906
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
in the description of the video

907
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
including links to where she got the Bill Nye

908
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
clips from, a bunch of newspaper

909
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
articles calling Bill Nye a full of shit

910
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
baby man who said the bad things

911
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
from places like...

912
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
The Federalist? Not a publication

913
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
I had heard of but that's alright.

914
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Let's just click the link to that source

915
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
in the description and...

916
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Oh. Weird.

917
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
That link isn't

918
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
in the description.

919
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
I wonder why.

920
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Instead, I had to find it myself by

921
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
googling the title. Oh boy!

922
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
It's an article from the Telegraph.

923
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
That bastion of accurate political

924
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
reporting entitled

925
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
9 in 10 babies born in parts

926
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
of Britain have a foreign parent.

927
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
That's the title. Do yourself a favour and keep

928
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
in mind for a second the phrases

929
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
9 in 10 and

930
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
parts of Britain. Now, let's

931
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
read the first paragraph.

932
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Almost 9 in 10 babies

933
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
born in parts of Britain have at least one

934
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
foreign-born parent, official figures

935
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,100
have revealed for the first time. Almost

936
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
9 in 10. Well, we've already

937
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
stepped back one from the headline.

938
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Almost 9 in 10 is not 9 in 10.

939
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
At least parts of Britain hasn't

940
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
changed. Oh well, maybe it's some

941
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
big parts. That's still a lot of people

942
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
with foreign-born parents even if it was 8

943
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
in 10. How about we read the

944
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
second paragraph? The Office

945
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
for National Statistics disclosed that

946
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
in 2012, more than

947
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
80% of babies born in

948
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
three London boroughs

949
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
had either one or both parents born outside

950
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
the UK. Oh, some more

951
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
backpedalling. Almost 9 in 10

952
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
is actually more than 80%,

953
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
which they refuse to pin down with the

954
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
actual percentage. I wonder why.

955
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Actually, I know why. It's because the number wasn't

956
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
convenient enough. And these foreign-born

957
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
parents' children are being born at this proportion

958
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
in three London

959
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
boroughs. Just...

960
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
just for those of you who don't know, London

961
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
has 32 boroughs.

962
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
The Telegraph found a very small

963
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
part of Britain with a high relative

964
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
birth rate among foreign-born parents

965
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
and fudged the numbers enough to get

966
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
an attention-grabbing headline to make it look like

967
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
we're being swarmed by immigrant babies.

968
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
What they actually did was draw a very

969
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
small circle around a part of the country

970
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
where a lot more immigrants live than the native-born

971
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
population. The figures were published

972
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
amid concerns that hundreds of thousands of

973
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
migrants from Romania and Bulgaria

974
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
could come to Britain when restrictions

975
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
are lifted in the new year.

976
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Wait. Those aren't the places

977
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Rage was talking about. Rage was talking

978
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
about people from Africa, and The Great Replacement

979
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
is all about diagrams of maps full of

980
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
little black people, overwhelming little white people,

981
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
and websites pushing it tell

982
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
lies about native women being encouraged

983
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
to procreate with African men.

984
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
This Telegraph article is scaremongering

985
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
about very different groups from the current

986
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
targets, who tend to be from more

987
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
brown, Muslim-y countries.

988
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
That's because Rage is citing an article

989
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
from 2013, back when the immigration

990
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
restrictions were set to be lifted, and

991
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
many totally smart people feared

992
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
we'd be flooded so heavily with

993
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Romanians and Bulgarians

994
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
that the country would literally collapse back

995
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
into the ocean from the added weight,

996
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
which, as we all know, literally happened.

997
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Just kidding. This reasonable

998
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
rational thinker who thinks they've out-scienced

999
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Bill Nye tried to scaremonger

1000
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
about immigration from the wrong place

1001
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
than the one they're talking about

1002
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
by citing the headline of a three-year-old article

1003
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
that all but admits it's completely

1004
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100
misrepresenting the actual data a few

1005
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
paragraphs in. Hey, look!

1006
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
I think we figured out why she didn't bother linking

1007
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
it in the description. Also note that

1008
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,100
when she does show the text of the article,

1009
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
it's blurred, so you can't pause it

1010
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
and check to see how heavily

1011
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
distorted the article is being

1012
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
with the truth. Weird how she

1013
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
knew to do that.

1014
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Almost as if she knows the source is full of shit,

1015
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
but didn't think anyone

1016
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
would bother to check.

1017
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Now, if you're anything like me, and I certainly hope

1018
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
not, you're probably wondering why,

1019
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
of all the articles to cite about

1020
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
immigration and overpopulation,

1021
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
why she would pick such an old one

1022
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
scaremongering about immigration from a different

1023
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
place? Like, why of all things

1024
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
would this article or its data

1025
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
form the basis for her claims?

1026
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Let's assume that you're gullible and you've been

1027
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
tricked into believing the lie that foreigners

1028
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
are coming to outbreed you, and you're so

1029
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
sure it's right that you don't feel the need to do

1030
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
any research, but you know you need to look

1031
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
like you did to seem credible, so you'd

1032
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
need a news story to flash up that looks

1033
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
like it supports you. How would you find

1034
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
an article that suits your needs? Well,

1035
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
if it was me, I would Google something

1036
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
ridiculous like, too many foreign

1037
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,100
babies, and pick the one with the most

1038
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
attention-getting headline that also looks like

1039
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
it did some actual statistical

1040
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
analysis. You know, like maybe the fourth

1041
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
one down, even. This attitude to

1042
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
science, studies, information,

1043
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
and facts is probably

1044
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
one of the many reasons why Rage and others

1045
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
found Nye's recent work so baffling.

1046
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
It appears that many people, without ever actually

1047
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
checking anything, have already decided

1048
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
what the truth is about issues of

1049
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
gender, or immigration, or global

1050
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
warming. Speaking of denying the

1051
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
science of climate change, I made a joke

1052
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
about Steven Crowder in the last video, and a

1053
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
bunch of people went,

1054
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
ooh, is he gonna do Crowder next?

1055
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
And I hate to disappoint my

1056
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
fan, so let's take

1057
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
a look at some of Stevie's work about Nye's

1058
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
recent work.

1059
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
That's an awfulâ€”retake that. Let's have a look at some

1060
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
of Stevie's recent work about Nye's

1061
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
recentâ€”I saidâ€”I did it again.

1062
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
I've saved myself the job of really having to

1063
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
go through his claims about the gender episode, because

1064
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
I've covered all the main ones already,

1065
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
and as we've already covered, these people

1066
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
have a habit of repeating each other's points.

1067
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
He wasâ€”he wasâ€”he's making the case that

1068
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
gender exists on a spectrum. By the way, very different if you go back

1069
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
to his old show, he did say that chromosomes determine gender.

1070
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
If you go back to the episodes when we were a kid.

1071
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
So he's done a one-eighth down there.

1072
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
So instead, I'll point out that his real beef

1073
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
with Nye comes from how Bill's vocal about

1074
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
climate change and doing something about it,

1075
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
and Crowder is sure that the science doesn't

1076
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
support man-made climate change, and he has

1077
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
some counter-arguments that he's sure are good.

1078
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
And then you have evidence, and the evidence

1079
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
disagrees with your worldview, so you deny

1080
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
the evidence, and then along with that,

1081
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
you deny the authorities that are providing

1082
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
the evidence. You will not deny the

1083
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
authorities. Now, we're going to be talkingâ€”

1084
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Eee! A talk in a

1085
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
German voice authoritarian joke.

1086
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Why, that's almost as good

1087
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
as knowing the science!

1088
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Uh, who wants to take a bet with me that

1089
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
at some point, he's recently made a video

1090
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
accusing the left of calling everyone

1091
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Nazis and how unproductive that is?

1092
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Just kidding. I've seen more than

1093
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
one of his videos, so I know he does that.

1094
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
The left has been so busy

1095
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
calling everyone Nazis.

1096
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Who would dare invoke

1097
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
needless comparison to the Nazis?

1098
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
What sort of imbecile

1099
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
would dare do

1100
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
something like that? Ah, no,

1101
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
he's just talking authoritatively in a

1102
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
German voice. That's not necessarily

1103
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
invoking comparison to the Nazis

1104
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
for political points.

1105
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Completely unrelatedly, just, you know,

1106
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
nothing to do with the last sentence,

1107
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
here's a segment from a video that he did

1108
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
about Nye on climate change.

1109
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Now, everybody, science is

1110
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
political. Science is political.

1111
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Incorrect. First, let me

1112
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
draw your attention to the definition of science.

1113
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
The intellectual and

1114
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
practical activity... Oh my god.

1115
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
I forgot that he actually cites

1116
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
the dictionary definition of science

1117
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
to try and avoid

1118
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
accepting the basic fact that, like,

1119
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
in order to stop the world from

1120
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
melting down, scientists might

1121
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
have to try and influence policy.

1122
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,100
Wait, wait, wait, no, this gets worse, doesn't it?

1123
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Merging politics and science, not allowing

1124
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
them to exist autonomously of each other

1125
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
can only serve to alter

1126
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
science's trajectory to the path of truth.

1127
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Okay? That's the main purpose here, and

1128
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Nye wants that specifically. Some examples?

1129
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I know it seems tired and old hat, but

1130
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
let's go to Nazi Germany. That's kind of

1131
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
a prime example of political science.

1132
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,100
It also, of course, led to guessing

1133
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
a few individuals.

1134
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
You heard me right. If scientists try

1135
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
to make the government listen to the

1136
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
effects of global warming and do something about it,

1137
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
it's the same as the Holocaust.

1138
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
With Steven Crowder, it's honestly

1139
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
a laugh a minute, watching him flip-flop between

1140
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
comparing everyone he doesn't like to the Nazis

1141
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,100
and their genocides, and complaining

1142
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
that way too many people are comparing

1143
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,100
things to the Nazis nowadays, especially those

1144
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
leftists, who are the only ones

1145
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
that do it.

1146
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
But where are the other scientists speaking up?

1147
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Kind of like with Islam.

1148
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,100
You know, we say, where are the Muslims speaking up

1149
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,100
against the acts of terrorism? Not only against terrorismâ€”

1150
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Weird how in the same video, where Crowder

1151
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
goes from saying how dangerous

1152
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
political science was to the Jews,

1153
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
he then, for seemingly no reason,

1154
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,100
decides to start spreading the,

1155
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
like, legit lie that

1156
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
Muslims don't condemn terror attacks.

1157
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
You know, I expected this video to

1158
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
contain lies about Bill Nye and the science.

1159
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
I did not expect it to contain lies

1160
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,100
about Muslims. I guess when you

1161
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
only have two talking points, you gotta

1162
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,100
find a way to fit them in somehow, right?

1163
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
You know, Steve, there are many gigantic lists

1164
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
out there of Muslims and Muslim groups

1165
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,100
that have come out against so-called

1166
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Islamic terror.

1167
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,100
But I can't think of a single Muslim who's condemned

1168
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,100
global warming. Coincidence?

1169
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Where are the Muslims speaking up

1170
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
against the acts of terrorism?

1171
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
It's very weird how he has to keep

1172
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
quibbling about nonsense

1173
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
instead of easily debunking

1174
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
the data he says can be easily

1175
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
debunked. And when he really does

1176
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,100
get around to trying to actually debunk

1177
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
climate science, when he's not saying

1178
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,100
people wanting to do something about it are

1179
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Nazis, he's doing such a poor job

1180
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,100
of debunking it that you don't even need

1181
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
me to show you the flaws in his understanding.

1182
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Even racists can accept

1183
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
climate change is a problem that begs a solution.

1184
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
"...problem when it comes to climate change."

1185
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Yes, I agree that climate change

1186
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,100
is an actual problem, and it needs to be

1187
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
sorted out, and we do need to sort out

1188
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
the consummation of electricity,

1189
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,100
and thenâ€” I'm honestly really

1190
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,100
quite stunned that in the middle of

1191
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,100
a video complaining about the

1192
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
bisexual agenda, spreading

1193
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
racist lies,

1194
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,100
scaremongering about immigration,

1195
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
and whose description has to defend

1196
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
the fact that she says Bill Nye

1197
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
has a Jewish nose,

1198
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Lady Stormfront

1199
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
still manages to have a better stance

1200
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,100
on climate change than Stephen Crowder.

1201
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,100
That's the lowest bar I've

1202
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,100
ever seen, and

1203
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
Crowdy Wowdy has just tripped

1204
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
over it, and fallen into a well.

1205
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
And it's not just rage that puts Crowder

1206
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
to shame. If you want to see his claims get debunked

1207
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
in more detail, there are many good videos

1208
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
out there by the, uh, seminal

1209
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
and personally inspirational Potholer54,

1210
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
andâ€”

1211
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Armored Skeptic?!

1212
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
...

1213
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Aw, that's right!

1214
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
We just came full circle!

1215
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
...the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain

1216
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
of 112 billion

1217
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,100
tons of ice per yearâ€”

1218
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
But you didn't mention that there's also a net

1219
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,100
loss for the entire planet.

1220
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,100
Greenland also has a

1221
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,100
major ice sheet. The total net

1222
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,100
ice loss for Greenland is an

1223
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
average of 269

1224
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,100
billion tons of ice

1225
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,100
every year. So the planet suffers

1226
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100
a net loss of

1227
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,100
147 billion

1228
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,100
tons of ice every year.

1229
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,100
You see, Skeptic was wrong

1230
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
about most of the issues he brought up about

1231
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,100
Nye's show, because he doesn't really have

1232
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,100
a grasp of the related science. But he's

1233
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,100
right enough about climate science to know

1234
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,100
Crowder's full of shit. The truly interesting

1235
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
thing about Skeptic and those like him is

1236
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
that if you pay attention, you can quite

1237
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
easily discern the places where they've actually

1238
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
decided to employ reason and

1239
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,100
skepticism and proper fact-checking,

1240
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,100
and the places where a sort of

1241
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,100
party line has formed of the same

1242
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,100
arguments repeating themselves over and over, but

1243
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,100
no one's really thought about the

1244
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
issue in that much detail. For

1245
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
these people, ignoring the latter and the parts where

1246
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
they just kind of complain about the SJWs,

1247
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,100
the former can actually be quite

1248
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
informative and interesting. Not

1249
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
always, but quite often. This

1250
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,100
schism is interesting, and the solution

1251
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,100
isn't all that hard. It actually just means employing

1252
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
reason and skepticism, but

1253
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
even more, about even more

1254
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
things. It would be nice if

1255
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
he acknowledged the existence of

1256
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
my video criticising him, or

1257
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
even tried to respond

1258
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,100
at all to the points

1259
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
in it, but I know how long

1260
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
this kind of thing can take. You've got to pick

1261
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
what you cover with your time very carefully, or

1262
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
nothing gets done, and I certainly can't criticise

1263
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,100
anyone for doing what they think is right

1264
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,100
with the time they have. For example, I've

1265
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,100
spent nearly two months of my life

1266
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
reading data and

1267
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,100
biology books

1268
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,100
and studies about trans

1269
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
people, and reading about the lived

1270
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,100
experiences of being trans in order to

1271
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,100
come to a better understanding before broaching this

1272
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
topic and responding to criticism,

1273
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,100
before realising that most of the criticism

1274
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,100
didn't do any research, and

1275
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,100
there was really no reason

1276
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,100
for me to do most of that reading,

1277
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,100
and I've had basically no

1278
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
chances to show all the work

1279
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,100
I did in this video, and I'm thoroughly

1280
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,100
disappointed in myself.

1281
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
I accidentally took the time to educate

1282
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
myself, to no benefit other than

1283
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
my own personal expansion of knowledge,

1284
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,100
like some kind of loser who

1285
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100
thinks that's important, and

1286
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,100
to think I did all that just

1287
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
to respond to videos

1288
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
covering an episode of a show that I didn't think

1289
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
was very good at covering the issues anyway.

1290
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
I want to close by focusing on a section

1291
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
of that episode that a lot of people complained

1292
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,100
about, probably because it rightfully made them

1293
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
feel uncomfortable, because

1294
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
it made me feel a bit uncomfortable too.

1295
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
So I'm gonna ask for a little help with that, and who

1296
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
better to talk about sex than two

1297
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,100
cis male

1298
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,100
white guys?

1299
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,100
It sat with me because I really

1300
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
can't avoid what it's pointing out.

1301
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
I can talk all day about whatever the right way

1302
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,100
to discuss or present these issues might be,

1303
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,100
but at the end of that day, I will still

1304
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,100
be an outsider to those issues.

1305
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
I was deeply curious what the opinion

1306
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,100
of someone who's actually affected by these issues

1307
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
might be about the show, so

1308
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
I reached out to trans YouTuber Zinnia Jones

1309
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
for her perspective on the issues, and

1310
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,100
she sent me this. Let's watch.

1311
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Hi, I'm Zinnia Jones.

1312
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm a trans woman, and I've been

1313
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
covering transgender issues on YouTube

1314
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,600
for several years. Personally,

1315
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
I enjoyed Bill Nye's presentation

1316
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
of the spectrum of gender and sexuality.

1317
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
As a trans person, I've often found coverage

1318
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
of these topics for a cisgender audience

1319
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
to be oversimplified or

1320
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
awkward, but this episode

1321
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
was surprisingly painless and even

1322
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,600
charming, and it offered a nuanced

1323
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
explanation of human diversity that's

1324
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,600
sadly lacking in most media.

1325
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
I was glad to see such a high-profile presentation

1326
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,100
of concepts that I and other

1327
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
trans advocates have been raising

1328
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,100
awareness of for years, such as

1329
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
the decoupling of gender from sex

1330
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
and the recognition of non-binary genders.

1331
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
The use of gender expression

1332
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
in South Korea's culture was

1333
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
a great concrete example of how

1334
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
our ideas about gender can be actively

1335
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
shaped by societal influences,

1336
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
and I felt that the ice cream segment

1337
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
was pretty effective in connecting

1338
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,100
sexuality to something that people can

1339
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,100
viscerally understand in their lives.

1340
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
Being told that your favorite flavor of ice cream

1341
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
is wrong would

1342
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
make no sense, and as they

1343
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
depicted, the people who feel the need

1344
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,100
to try and rewrite their sexual orientation

1345
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
do tend to end up

1346
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
in some very queer situations.

1347
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
As someone who loved watching Bill Nye

1348
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,100
as a kid, I'll admit it was a bit strange

1349
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
to hear a song about handjobs

1350
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,100
and powerbombs, but

1351
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,100
on the whole, I think this episode is

1352
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
a good introduction for people who may

1353
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
not be aware of what we now know

1354
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
about the full range of gender and sexuality.

1355
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,100
Um.

1356
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
When I

1357
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,100
went to find an alternative

1358
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
perspective, I

1359
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
had kind of banked on it

1360
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,100
kind of semi-resembling the one

1361
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
I'd had. Like, it would have been

1362
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
really convenient for me if I could end the video

1363
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
with, hey, remember what I thought about

1364
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
the episode? Well, here's someone who knows way more

1365
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
about the issue, and they agree with me!

1366
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,100
But no, it turns out my perspective

1367
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,100
can be flawed. I think Zinnia makes

1368
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
an interesting point that I completely missed.

1369
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
Ultimately, Bill Nye's doing

1370
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
what Bill Nye has always done. Provide

1371
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,100
a rudimentary, baseline explanation

1372
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
of a topic to an audience whose science

1373
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,100
education may well have ended in high

1374
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
school. Like when we discussed

1375
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,100
the act of writing an episode of this

1376
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
show earlier, pointing this out

1377
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
puts a lot of this episode in perspective.

1378
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,100
Nye's show is for such a broad audience

1379
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,100
of folks who may not know anything

1380
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,100
about the topic. In a way,

1381
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
the only people who this episode isn't

1382
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
for are people who already

1383
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,100
think a lot about the topic,

1384
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
people who live the topic because it's a part

1385
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,100
of their daily lives, and

1386
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,100
of course, people who think that by

1387
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,100
simply thinking about this issue too

1388
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
much, you've taken the wrong side

1389
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,100
in a culture war, something

1390
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,100
something liberal agenda, blah

1391
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,100
blah, too pro-gay.

1392
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
Now, at this point, I am

1393
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
contractually obliged to mention that exposure

1394
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
to this video directly may make you up to

1395
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
15% more gay, so

1396
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
it's highly recommended that you wear your

1397
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,100
ideological protection goggles provided

1398
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,100
underneath your siâ€”hang on a second.

1399
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,100
Why is this written at the end of the script?

1400
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
Hey there, thanks for watching.

1401
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,100
I'd like to thank Horikawa Otone for

1402
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,100
letting me butcher her name like that

1403
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,100
and also for help with the research that went

1404
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,100
into making this video. If there's any mistakes,

1405
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,100
it's because I forgot to run them past her.

1406
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,100
I'd also like to thank Zinnia Jones for recording

1407
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,100
her contribution, that was very nice of her,

1408
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
and also ContraPoints for recording that one

1409
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,100
line, which she did on incredibly short

1410
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,100
notice, like the day before this video was

1411
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,100
gonna come out. Thank you very much for that, Contra.

1412
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,100
Most of the music used in this video,

1413
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,100
including the song you're hearing right now,

1414
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
was created by Krista Lee from her album

1415
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,100
Fantasy Zone, a tribute to the music of

1416
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,100
various Sega games. It's on Bandcamp,

1417
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,100
check it out, link in the description.

1418
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,100
And, finally, thanks

1419
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,100
to all my lovely patrons for enabling

1420
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
me. In addition to the names going past the screen

1421
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
right now, I'd especially like to thank

1422
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,100
three-fifths of a brain,

1423
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,100
a bunch of question marks, I hope that's not an error

1424
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,100
on the list I made, a bowl of

1425
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,100
creamy tomato soup, Aislinn,

1426
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Aidan Bradley, Al Swigert,

1427
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,100

ten dollars to Hbomberguy, Benjamin
