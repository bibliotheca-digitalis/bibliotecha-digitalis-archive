1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
You know, quite often I get YouTube comments, messages, askfms, and singing telegrams

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,700
telling me the main reason I haven't accepted the Rationals as my true lords and saviors

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,600
is because I'm only looking at idiots.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,900
Apparently it's MY fault that the stupidest neoreactionaries and anti-feminists on YouTube

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,800
are also the most popular, rising to the top like the WHITEST CREAM.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,700
But I'm sure that's my anti-free-speech, pro-censorship, virtue-signal, regressive-leftist,

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,900
white-hating, pro-Spengler bias talking.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,200
There must be some... really actually smart thinkers out there with the real evidence on their side

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
to back up their beliefs, right?

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,200
So let's look at some studies done into supposedly feminist issues

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,400
and see what the best and brightest of the internet badass ultra-rationals have to offer.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, and if for some reason you're upset by trigger warnings,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,200
I invite you to grow up, you big fucking BABY!

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,700
♫

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,400
One term anti-feminism simply cannot abide is

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,500
one-in-five, a term referring to a study released in 2007 with data gathered from two American universities.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,900
The data implies that as many as one in five women on this campus experienced something

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,700
that would fall under the legal criminal definition of sexual assault through their years on campus.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,000
The study does have methodological caveats that are worth keeping in mind

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,200
if you're using it to draw a conclusion about the general state of campus society nationwide,

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,000
being over a short period and only conducted on two campuses, for example.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Two of the people who worked on the study published an article in Time

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,000
saying that using one-in-five as representative of campuses nationwide is inappropriate.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
However, they do point out that the data is not inconsistent with other similar studies

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,900
performed before and after, and that learning what happens on campuses

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,200
and perhaps trying to figure out how to deal with it is obviously an issue worth looking at.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,700
This study is most likely the source for Joe Biden and Barack Obama's use of the one-in-five claim in various speeches.

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,700
Right now, nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape.

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,000
We know the numbers.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,500
One in five of every one of those young women who's dropped off that first day of school

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,200
before they finish school will be assaulted.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,100
If you're going to claim that Biden and Obama's use of these figures is reductionist, I would agree with you.

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,900
But that is what the data implies, and it's also what the rest of the data implies.

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,700
While one in five is obviously an estimate based on incomplete data,

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,700
debunking the study is immensely important to reactionaries

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,500
because given how colleges do often take steps to try and prevent this behavior—

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,700
for example, by telling students that it's not okay to continue fucking someone if they want you to stop—

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,900
if they can shoot one of the central studies full of holes, they can create a narrative

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,300
in which feminism is using bad science to tell all men they're rapists

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,300
and take over campus to push an agenda and they're a cult and something something George Orwell—

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,100
because that's the real problem here, right?

42
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,800
That's the thing that needs to be corrected.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,600
There are no other social issues that we could be discussing.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,400
The real issue is, I think people are pretending there's more rape than there is,

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,600
and should I really have to stop if someone asks me to?

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,000
The real problem is the feminists want me to ask for consent.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Many different totally rational freethinkers have stepped up to the plate to debunk this study,

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,800
but to avoid accidentally picking an idiot again,

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I picked someone vetted by Reddit and Twitter and YouTube comment sections to be a true rationalist—

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
Sargon of Akkad.

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,700
You can tell he's smart because his scream name is taken from a historical figure.

52
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,600
That basically makes him right already.

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,100
At least according to his fans—

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,600
and also to the EDL—

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm gonna call him Carl because that's his name.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,100
Carl debunks 1 in 5 by citing the study and explaining the problem he has with it.

57
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,500
I'll just let the video play and stop when I see a problem.

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,700
Our feminist activist will be quoting from sources like this.

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Wait, that isn't the study.

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,100
That's not the 1 in 5 study.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,800
The one he does cite even specifically references the 1 in 5 study in shots he uses in the video.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
He didn't even get the study right!

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
The description of this video literally says,

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,800
explaining where the claim originated,

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,200
while citing the study that didn't originate the claim.

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Heck, let's see how he debunks this one.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,400
A report on the Association of American Universities' campus climate survey

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
on sexual assault and sexual misconduct.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,700
It's a survey.

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,900
Survey.

72
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,600
That makes it bad. You know it's bad because he says it like that.

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
He seems to have a problem with the fact that the only real way to find out about this stuff is to ask people.

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Regardless, the idea that surveys are inherently unscientific is interesting, though.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Keep that in mind for later.

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,200
Took that away in your...

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,400
brain...

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,300
pockets.

79
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,000
He then goes on to claim that this survey stretched the definition of sexual assault.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,900
The first two tactics generally meet legal definitions of rape and sexual battery.

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,500
The other two tactics are violation of student codes of conduct.

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,600
And it is unsurprisingly this massive inflation of what is and is not sexual assault

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,200
that accounts for the one in five figure.

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Like they said, half of their categories don't even fall under the legal definition of sexual assault or rape.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Therefore, including that in any results is going to be inherently misleading.

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Well, obviously, if you redefine sexual assault to be anything mean you don't like, of course it happens a lot.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Pack your bags, feminists.

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,300
Except if you actually read the study, it measures all of these things separately.

89
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,300
I let Carl off for accidentally picking the wrong study, but he could at least read the one he picked.

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,800
The study carefully takes pains to point out that it measured all of these things separately

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,300
and sorts the data into appropriate tables.

92
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,500
So, if you're looking at women whose report showed they had experienced something deemed a criminal act

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
and none of the extra stuff, this table shows it.

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,800
27.2%.

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,300
Which, by the way, is more than one in five.

96
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,300
In fact, it's slightly more than one in four, without expanding the definition.

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,600
Now, let's be clear.

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,500
Maybe some of these women misremembered or actively lied for some reason because that's something to worry about.

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,400
And as mentioned already, there are clear methodological reasons why it would be inappropriate to claim

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,700
these statistics are accurate to all universities or to the places the survey was conducted as a whole.

101
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,600
But even accounting for all of this, 27.2% is quite an alarming percentage.

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,700
And it's also quite important to point out that the two separate studies, conducted by separate groups,

103
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,100
both yielded rather similar results.

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,700
But Carlgon didn't notice this.

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,200
Instead, he concludes that clearly the study is biased claptrap that should be ignored and paid no heed whatsoever.

106
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
After all, it's a survey.

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,900
And finally, these surveys are not facts.

108
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,600
So, what alternative evidence does he offer to show what's really happening on campus is in reality?

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,100
Because I'm rational.

110
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,500
Simple. He signs a report by the Department of Justice showing that the numbers are actually lower.

111
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And you can trust this one because Carl's sure it's factual.

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,400
Because as we've just seen, he's so good at reading studies.

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,000
"...rape and sexual assault victimization rates among college-age females between 1995 and 2013.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,200
For young women enrolled in college, this went down to 6.1 per thousand students.

115
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,100
This is less than 1%.

116
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,800
These are facts we can be certain of."

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
Yeah, these are the facts.

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,700
Unlike the sur- wait, this one was a survey as well!

119
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,700
It literally says the findings are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey.

120
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,400
It shows it just beneath the section he shows in his video.

121
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Did he not read any more than the first paragraph of the first page of the study he claims is the factual one?

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,200
What the fuck?!

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,700
He backs up his claim with studies using the same methods he previously decried as not worth looking at.

124
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,200
Because this time the data shows what he wants it to show.

125
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,400
Just to double-check, let's see how many times this 20-page document uses the word survey.

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,500
94.

127
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,700
The word survey is used an average of 4.7 times a page!

128
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,300
You would have to not read the entire study to miss this!

129
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,900
But alongside being literally factually wrong,

130
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,700
there are factors that lead me to believe that Carl didn't even read the first page of this study.

131
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,800
The only thing that is left out of these facts are the number of unreported sexual assaults and rapes.

132
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,500
What? No!

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,200
The report did document what percentage of victims never reported the incident on the first page!

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
You can even see it in Carl's video!

135
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,100
It's right there!

136
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,300
It takes up so much of the first page that missing it is practically impossible!

137
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,800
You'd have to be either illiterate or lying to make that claim!

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,100
Carl is literally showcasing how little he reads of these studies!

139
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,700
It would almost be a relief to discover that Spleiva Darunia was the only idiot

140
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,200
pretending to use sources to back up his pseudoscientific ideas.

141
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
But surprise, surprise, the guy who hung out with him for almost a year

142
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
before finally picking up on how he's a fucking crazy person does it too.

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,900
And of course, like his fellow true smarty rational,

144
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Sargon also managed to talk for 25 minutes about what he thinks of a film

145
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,500
he'd seen at most two and a half minutes of in a trailer.

146
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,100
So he'd seen about as large a portion of the actual Ghostbusters film

147
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,800
as he seems to have read of this fucking study.

148
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,700
It's a survey, unlike this survey, which was regular.

149
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,900
You can trust surveys, but you can't trust surveys!

150
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,500
So, so far, the best anti-feminist the YouTube Babyman landscape has to offer

151
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,600
has cited the wrong study, got the facts about the data in the study wrong,

152
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,000
decried that it's a survey, cited another survey as fact while not noticing it's a survey,

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,100
and then failed to understand why the data's actually different from the previous one.

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,900
Anyone out there convinced yet?

155
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,400
I leave now as the time to abandon feminism in the face of these superior reasoning skills.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,500
Now's the time to be clear I'm not being very original here.

157
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,200
Someone else, a guy called Garrett, already pointed out a lot of these issues

158
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,700
far more comprehensively in a video of his own.

159
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,200
Dude, if you're going to attempt to misrepresent studies,

160
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
at least try to not be so sloppy about it.

161
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,300
People claim that such studies are broadening the definition of rape or sexual assault

162
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,800
when they actually aren't.

163
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,100
I personally think that Sargon wouldn't be lazy enough to not even read the first page of a study.

164
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,900
But then again, there is of course a chance I'm wrong about that.

165
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,100
So, either he is intentionally misrepresenting the information he's using in his video,

166
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,300
or he is being mind-blowingly sloppy.

167
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
These are facts we can be certain of.

168
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,000
Nope. They're estimates.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Maybe you didn't realize that, but again, it is mentioned in the very image you used in your video.

170
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,700
Oops.

171
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,600
He covers everything I covered here and more,

172
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,300
and explains how to read studies in a really useful way.

173
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,900
I would highly recommend you watch it.

174
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,400
So clearly, Sargon has had the chance to defend his argument and argue his case

175
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,300
and explain how actually we're missing something,

176
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,900
or even realize his errors and admit his reading of studies could do with some improvement.

177
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, fucking hell.

178
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Can you not summarize this in under five minutes?

179
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't have the patience to sit through over half an hour of this.

180
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,900
Well, that sounds reasonable.

181
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,200
["Laughter"]

182
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,100
When I started working on this video, looking at the statistics touted by anti-feminists,

183
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,300
I was expecting to finally see the proof, evidence, reasoning, and love of critical discussion

184
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,400
anti-feminists always say they totally want to have, and finally understand their point of view.

185
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,800
I would actually really like to be shown all the sexual assault statistics I've seen are false.

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,500
It would be comforting to know it doesn't happen nearly as much as is implied.

187
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,000
But instead, all I've been shown is that to be an anti-feminist,

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
you have to have no understanding of how to read studies,

189
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,600
or what words mean, and insist on remaining that way by ignoring criticism.

190
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,500
Ironically, while he doesn't have the time to watch and respond to a genuine good-faith attempt

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
to explain the issue with his reasoning,

192
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,700
Sargon does have the time to watch my comedy video where I laugh at skull men,

193
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,600
and insist I take them more seriously, and give proper rebuttals.

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,100
So, there's plenty of time to find criticism you don't deem thoughtful enough to complain about—

195
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,900
in fact, he does this every fucking week—

196
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,800
but he somehow couldn't find the time to respond to actual, real criticism, and raise the discussion.

197
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Hmm, I wonder if this is where the bias Sargon keeps complaining about is coming from.

198
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
At the very least, he's right about one thing.

199
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,600
It is very easy to laugh at David Sorrini.

200
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I agree with that one.

201
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,800
It takes a lot of effort to take his ideas seriously for long stretches of time I won't watch,

202
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,300
because I don't look for ideas that challenge me, because that's how being rational works.

203
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,900
He also complains that the video he hasn't watched should have talked about a video someone else made,

204
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,200
which is a pretty weird fucking tactic to use to defend your claims.

205
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
Also, he did touch on it.

206
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
So, you know,

207
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
MAYBE WATCH THE VIDEO BEFORE RESPONDING TO IT!

208
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
I HAVE TO POINT THIS OUT NOW, APPARENTLY!

209
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,700
Didn't dig deeply enough is I can only assume code for was objectively wrong.

210
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,200
You know, I still don't get why he arrived at the wrong study like this.

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
How did he miss the actual CSA study and arrive at this one?

212
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,900
Even PragerU, a fake YouTube university set up by the craziest man in the fucking world,

213
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,600
correctly cites the study.

214
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Heck, even a cursory Google search of the times Joe Biden or Barack Obama have used the number

215
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,400
links to the correct study as the source.

216
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Why did he get the study wrong?

217
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,200
This made me curious, so I tried to figure out why.

218
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,100
My long and arduous search brought me to the Wikipedia page for campus sexual assault.

219
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,300
The first study listed on that page is the one he cited.

220
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,400
I'm not saying this is what happened,

221
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,300
but imagine for a moment Googling campus sexual assault,

222
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,100
and looking at the first source on a page,

223
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,100
and just assuming it's the source of the 1 in 5 statistic,

224
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,000
and just ignoring the parts in that study that cited 1 in 5 numerous times,

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,900
and even links to it.

226
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,100
If he had scrolled down just slightly to the third entry on the fucking page,

227
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,400
he would have seen the actual CSA study,

228
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,300
and also that it's described as the source of the 1 in 5 statistic.

229
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Between these two is the study he cited as facts.

230
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,800
Note how it's described numerous times to also be a fucking survey.

231
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,500
I really don't know how he missed that.

232
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,800
So maybe he didn't even read the Wikipedia page.

233
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,500
Who knows what he actually read?

234
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,400
Trying to find something he has read is quite difficult.

235
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,700
In that comment before,

236
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,800
he quotes books that he claimed in livestreams later that he hadn't read.

237
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,400
So he, like, Googles quotes or something to find his evidence?

238
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,100
I could find the quote of him saying this,

239
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
but these videos are sometimes several hours long,

240
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,900
and that's too long for my liking!

241
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Speaking of cursory research that fucking anyone can do,

242
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,800
for a long time, this picture of a statue was Carl's avatar,

243
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,100
and the logo he used in his videos when he pauses to talk over them.

244
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,700
I mean, his internet handle is Sargon of Akkad,

245
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,200
and he puts the words Sargon of Akkad next to pictures of the statue,

246
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,500
so obviously he thinks it's a statue of Sargon, right?

247
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
But is it?

248
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
SPOILERS, IT'S NOT. IT'S FUCKING NOT.

249
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
EVEN HIS FUCKING LOGO IS OF THE WRONG PERSON.

250
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,300
The Museum of Iraq, which currently holds the artifact,

251
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,200
simply refers to it as Head of King,

252
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,100
and points out that it's not known who this represents.

253
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,700
It could be a statue of his son or his grandson or another descendant

254
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,200
or even a statue representing the Akkadian lineage itself in a metaphysical way.

255
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,600
The same way, for example, Moe statues represent Polynesian ancestry

256
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,900
without being a literal portrait of anyone.

257
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,400
So, why did he assume this is Sargon?

258
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Well...

259
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,000
Wikipedia says it probably might be.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,300
Well, I mean, if Wikipedia says it!

261
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,000
Interestingly enough, the folks on the talk page of Sargon of Akkad,

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,100
the actual historical figure, not the man-baby who doesn't read studies before claiming they prove his right,

263
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
discussed how it's impossible to verify,

264
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,400
but that the little evidence we do have implies it's far more likely to be a statue of Naram-Sin,

265
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
Sargon's grandson,

266
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,000
and cite a pretty impressive source showing that this is more likely to be the case than it being Sargon,

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
because a sculpture that we know to be of Naram-Sin,

268
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
because its inscription is still intact,

269
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,500
has a very strong resemblance with the other statue.

270
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,200
They only decided to keep the statue on the Sargon page

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,000
because there isn't really any other surviving iconography of the Akkadian royalty

272
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
and because people, also known as idiots,

273
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,100
for some reason like to assume it's Sargon.

274
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,500
So by probably, the article means...

275
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,700
probably not.

276
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,100
But probably not is good enough for Karl,

277
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,500
and it was good enough for a long time until he apparently noticed this finally and changed it.

278
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,400
In conclusion, if you don't look very well for studies,

279
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,500
misread the data,

280
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
ignore the words and pictures surrounding the data,

281
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,900
and ignore people's attempts to correct you,

282
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,600
sexual assault isn't a problem on college campuses!

283
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,500
Take that, feminism!

284
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,300
It's no surprise that so few people's minds have been changed in the face of this sterling logic.

285
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Karl's only recourse was to attempt to have everyone who disagrees with him erased from academia.

286
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,500
Just kidding. Not even Karl would be stupid enough to think that would be a good idea.

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Oh, for fuck's sake!

288
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:32,200
I'd also like to say a special thanks to Aaron Salisbury, Alicia Parker Martell, Bob, Casey Schneibel, Kieran, David Rose, InstantGrat, Jack Hargraves, Jack Harvey, and Jan Anders.

289
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Thank you all very much for watching.

290
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,200
My patrons seem interested in me doing a video about the EU referendum, so that'll be out soon.

291
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,200
Hopefully before the referendum, I mean.

292
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
That would be nice.

293
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,500
The video about Sargon's petition will be out as soon as some new audio equipment arrives,

294
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,400
and I've found the exact Commodore 64 tape I want to steal music from for a thing I'm doing at the end.

295
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,200
See you all next time!

296
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, and for those of you that have already left an angry comment and downvoted this video because it's critical of Sargon,

297
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,100
thanks for helping prove the point I'm going to be making in a future video.

298
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Seriously.

299
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,800
I knew I could count on you.
