0	6600	You know, quite often I get YouTube comments, messages, askfms, and singing telegrams
6600	10700	telling me the main reason I haven't accepted the Rationals as my true lords and saviors
10700	12600	is because I'm only looking at idiots.
12600	16900	Apparently it's MY fault that the stupidest neoreactionaries and anti-feminists on YouTube
16900	21800	are also the most popular, rising to the top like the WHITEST CREAM.
21800	25700	But I'm sure that's my anti-free-speech, pro-censorship, virtue-signal, regressive-leftist,
25700	27900	white-hating, pro-Spengler bias talking.
27900	33200	There must be some... really actually smart thinkers out there with the real evidence on their side
33200	35300	to back up their beliefs, right?
35300	38200	So let's look at some studies done into supposedly feminist issues
38200	42400	and see what the best and brightest of the internet badass ultra-rationals have to offer.
49000	51000	Oh, and if for some reason you're upset by trigger warnings,
51000	54200	I invite you to grow up, you big fucking BABY!
54300	56700	♫
57700	60400	One term anti-feminism simply cannot abide is
60400	66500	one-in-five, a term referring to a study released in 2007 with data gathered from two American universities.
66500	70900	The data implies that as many as one in five women on this campus experienced something
70900	75700	that would fall under the legal criminal definition of sexual assault through their years on campus.
75700	79000	The study does have methodological caveats that are worth keeping in mind
79000	83200	if you're using it to draw a conclusion about the general state of campus society nationwide,
83200	87000	being over a short period and only conducted on two campuses, for example.
87000	89600	Two of the people who worked on the study published an article in Time
89600	94000	saying that using one-in-five as representative of campuses nationwide is inappropriate.
94000	97800	However, they do point out that the data is not inconsistent with other similar studies
97800	100900	performed before and after, and that learning what happens on campuses
100900	105200	and perhaps trying to figure out how to deal with it is obviously an issue worth looking at.
105200	110700	This study is most likely the source for Joe Biden and Barack Obama's use of the one-in-five claim in various speeches.
110700	116700	Right now, nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape.
116700	119000	We know the numbers.
119000	124500	One in five of every one of those young women who's dropped off that first day of school
124500	127200	before they finish school will be assaulted.
127200	132100	If you're going to claim that Biden and Obama's use of these figures is reductionist, I would agree with you.
132100	136900	But that is what the data implies, and it's also what the rest of the data implies.
136900	140700	While one in five is obviously an estimate based on incomplete data,
140700	143700	debunking the study is immensely important to reactionaries
143700	147500	because given how colleges do often take steps to try and prevent this behavior—
147500	151700	for example, by telling students that it's not okay to continue fucking someone if they want you to stop—
151700	154900	if they can shoot one of the central studies full of holes, they can create a narrative
154900	158300	in which feminism is using bad science to tell all men they're rapists
158300	163300	and take over campus to push an agenda and they're a cult and something something George Orwell—
163300	165100	because that's the real problem here, right?
165100	166800	That's the thing that needs to be corrected.
166800	169600	There are no other social issues that we could be discussing.
169600	173400	The real issue is, I think people are pretending there's more rape than there is,
173400	176600	and should I really have to stop if someone asks me to?
176600	180000	The real problem is the feminists want me to ask for consent.
180000	184200	Many different totally rational freethinkers have stepped up to the plate to debunk this study,
184200	186800	but to avoid accidentally picking an idiot again,
186800	191800	I picked someone vetted by Reddit and Twitter and YouTube comment sections to be a true rationalist—
191800	193200	Sargon of Akkad.
193200	196700	You can tell he's smart because his scream name is taken from a historical figure.
196700	198600	That basically makes him right already.
198600	200100	At least according to his fans—
200100	201600	and also to the EDL—
201600	204400	I'm gonna call him Carl because that's his name.
204400	208100	Carl debunks 1 in 5 by citing the study and explaining the problem he has with it.
208100	210500	I'll just let the video play and stop when I see a problem.
210500	214700	Our feminist activist will be quoting from sources like this.
214700	216700	Wait, that isn't the study.
216700	218100	That's not the 1 in 5 study.
218100	223800	The one he does cite even specifically references the 1 in 5 study in shots he uses in the video.
223800	225800	He didn't even get the study right!
225800	227600	The description of this video literally says,
227600	229800	explaining where the claim originated,
229800	233200	while citing the study that didn't originate the claim.
233200	235000	Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
235000	237400	Heck, let's see how he debunks this one.
237400	242400	A report on the Association of American Universities' campus climate survey
242400	245000	on sexual assault and sexual misconduct.
245000	246700	It's a survey.
246700	247900	Survey.
247900	250600	That makes it bad. You know it's bad because he says it like that.
250600	255600	He seems to have a problem with the fact that the only real way to find out about this stuff is to ask people.
255600	259000	Regardless, the idea that surveys are inherently unscientific is interesting, though.
259000	260500	Keep that in mind for later.
260500	262200	Took that away in your...
262200	263400	brain...
263400	264300	pockets.
264300	269000	He then goes on to claim that this survey stretched the definition of sexual assault.
269000	273900	The first two tactics generally meet legal definitions of rape and sexual battery.
273900	277500	The other two tactics are violation of student codes of conduct.
277500	283600	And it is unsurprisingly this massive inflation of what is and is not sexual assault
283600	286200	that accounts for the one in five figure.
286200	292600	Like they said, half of their categories don't even fall under the legal definition of sexual assault or rape.
292600	297600	Therefore, including that in any results is going to be inherently misleading.
297600	302800	Well, obviously, if you redefine sexual assault to be anything mean you don't like, of course it happens a lot.
302800	304600	Pack your bags, feminists.
304600	308300	Except if you actually read the study, it measures all of these things separately.
308300	313300	I let Carl off for accidentally picking the wrong study, but he could at least read the one he picked.
313300	317800	The study carefully takes pains to point out that it measured all of these things separately
317800	320300	and sorts the data into appropriate tables.
320300	325500	So, if you're looking at women whose report showed they had experienced something deemed a criminal act
325500	328500	and none of the extra stuff, this table shows it.
328500	330800	27.2%.
330800	333300	Which, by the way, is more than one in five.
333300	338300	In fact, it's slightly more than one in four, without expanding the definition.
338300	339600	Now, let's be clear.
339600	345500	Maybe some of these women misremembered or actively lied for some reason because that's something to worry about.
345500	350400	And as mentioned already, there are clear methodological reasons why it would be inappropriate to claim
350400	355700	these statistics are accurate to all universities or to the places the survey was conducted as a whole.
355700	360600	But even accounting for all of this, 27.2% is quite an alarming percentage.
360600	365700	And it's also quite important to point out that the two separate studies, conducted by separate groups,
365700	368100	both yielded rather similar results.
368100	369700	But Carlgon didn't notice this.
369700	375200	Instead, he concludes that clearly the study is biased claptrap that should be ignored and paid no heed whatsoever.
375200	377400	After all, it's a survey.
377400	380900	And finally, these surveys are not facts.
380900	385600	So, what alternative evidence does he offer to show what's really happening on campus is in reality?
385600	387100	Because I'm rational.
387100	391500	Simple. He signs a report by the Department of Justice showing that the numbers are actually lower.
391500	394500	And you can trust this one because Carl's sure it's factual.
394500	397400	Because as we've just seen, he's so good at reading studies.
397400	404000	"...rape and sexual assault victimization rates among college-age females between 1995 and 2013.
404000	410200	For young women enrolled in college, this went down to 6.1 per thousand students.
410200	413100	This is less than 1%.
413100	414800	These are facts we can be certain of."
414800	416400	Yeah, these are the facts.
416400	419700	Unlike the sur- wait, this one was a survey as well!
419700	425700	It literally says the findings are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey.
425700	429400	It shows it just beneath the section he shows in his video.
429400	436600	Did he not read any more than the first paragraph of the first page of the study he claims is the factual one?
436600	438200	What the fuck?!
438200	444700	He backs up his claim with studies using the same methods he previously decried as not worth looking at.
444700	448200	Because this time the data shows what he wants it to show.
448200	454400	Just to double-check, let's see how many times this 20-page document uses the word survey.
456200	457500	94.
457500	461700	The word survey is used an average of 4.7 times a page!
461700	465300	You would have to not read the entire study to miss this!
465300	468900	But alongside being literally factually wrong,
468900	473700	there are factors that lead me to believe that Carl didn't even read the first page of this study.
473700	480800	The only thing that is left out of these facts are the number of unreported sexual assaults and rapes.
480800	482500	What? No!
482500	489200	The report did document what percentage of victims never reported the incident on the first page!
489200	491600	You can even see it in Carl's video!
491600	493100	It's right there!
493100	497300	It takes up so much of the first page that missing it is practically impossible!
497300	500800	You'd have to be either illiterate or lying to make that claim!
500800	505100	Carl is literally showcasing how little he reads of these studies!
505100	508700	It would almost be a relief to discover that Spleiva Darunia was the only idiot
508700	512200	pretending to use sources to back up his pseudoscientific ideas.
512200	515200	But surprise, surprise, the guy who hung out with him for almost a year
515200	518800	before finally picking up on how he's a fucking crazy person does it too.
518800	521900	And of course, like his fellow true smarty rational,
521900	525700	Sargon also managed to talk for 25 minutes about what he thinks of a film
525700	528500	he'd seen at most two and a half minutes of in a trailer.
528500	532100	So he'd seen about as large a portion of the actual Ghostbusters film
532100	534800	as he seems to have read of this fucking study.
534800	537700	It's a survey, unlike this survey, which was regular.
537700	540900	You can trust surveys, but you can't trust surveys!
540900	545500	So, so far, the best anti-feminist the YouTube Babyman landscape has to offer
545500	549600	has cited the wrong study, got the facts about the data in the study wrong,
549600	555000	decried that it's a survey, cited another survey as fact while not noticing it's a survey,
555000	559100	and then failed to understand why the data's actually different from the previous one.
559600	560900	Anyone out there convinced yet?
560900	565400	I leave now as the time to abandon feminism in the face of these superior reasoning skills.
565400	568500	Now's the time to be clear I'm not being very original here.
568500	572200	Someone else, a guy called Garrett, already pointed out a lot of these issues
572200	574700	far more comprehensively in a video of his own.
574700	577200	Dude, if you're going to attempt to misrepresent studies,
577200	579200	at least try to not be so sloppy about it.
579200	583300	People claim that such studies are broadening the definition of rape or sexual assault
583300	584800	when they actually aren't.
584800	590100	I personally think that Sargon wouldn't be lazy enough to not even read the first page of a study.
590100	592900	But then again, there is of course a chance I'm wrong about that.
592900	597100	So, either he is intentionally misrepresenting the information he's using in his video,
597100	599300	or he is being mind-blowingly sloppy.
599300	601300	These are facts we can be certain of.
601300	603000	Nope. They're estimates.
603000	607800	Maybe you didn't realize that, but again, it is mentioned in the very image you used in your video.
607800	608700	Oops.
608700	610600	He covers everything I covered here and more,
610600	613300	and explains how to read studies in a really useful way.
613300	614900	I would highly recommend you watch it.
614900	618400	So clearly, Sargon has had the chance to defend his argument and argue his case
618400	620300	and explain how actually we're missing something,
620300	623900	or even realize his errors and admit his reading of studies could do with some improvement.
623900	625300	Oh, fucking hell.
625300	628300	Can you not summarize this in under five minutes?
628300	631600	I don't have the patience to sit through over half an hour of this.
632500	633900	Well, that sounds reasonable.
633900	635200	["Laughter"]
635200	639100	When I started working on this video, looking at the statistics touted by anti-feminists,
639200	644300	I was expecting to finally see the proof, evidence, reasoning, and love of critical discussion
644300	649400	anti-feminists always say they totally want to have, and finally understand their point of view.
649400	653800	I would actually really like to be shown all the sexual assault statistics I've seen are false.
653800	657500	It would be comforting to know it doesn't happen nearly as much as is implied.
657500	660000	But instead, all I've been shown is that to be an anti-feminist,
660000	662700	you have to have no understanding of how to read studies,
662700	667600	or what words mean, and insist on remaining that way by ignoring criticism.
667600	671500	Ironically, while he doesn't have the time to watch and respond to a genuine good-faith attempt
671500	673300	to explain the issue with his reasoning,
673300	677700	Sargon does have the time to watch my comedy video where I laugh at skull men,
677700	681600	and insist I take them more seriously, and give proper rebuttals.
681600	686100	So, there's plenty of time to find criticism you don't deem thoughtful enough to complain about—
686100	687900	in fact, he does this every fucking week—
687900	693800	but he somehow couldn't find the time to respond to actual, real criticism, and raise the discussion.
693900	697900	Hmm, I wonder if this is where the bias Sargon keeps complaining about is coming from.
697900	699900	At the very least, he's right about one thing.
699900	702600	It is very easy to laugh at David Sorrini.
702600	703600	I agree with that one.
703600	707800	It takes a lot of effort to take his ideas seriously for long stretches of time I won't watch,
707800	711300	because I don't look for ideas that challenge me, because that's how being rational works.
711300	715900	He also complains that the video he hasn't watched should have talked about a video someone else made,
715900	720200	which is a pretty weird fucking tactic to use to defend your claims.
720200	721800	Also, he did touch on it.
721800	722600	So, you know,
722600	725600	MAYBE WATCH THE VIDEO BEFORE RESPONDING TO IT!
725600	727800	I HAVE TO POINT THIS OUT NOW, APPARENTLY!
727800	732700	Didn't dig deeply enough is I can only assume code for was objectively wrong.
732700	737200	You know, I still don't get why he arrived at the wrong study like this.
737200	740800	How did he miss the actual CSA study and arrive at this one?
740800	746900	Even PragerU, a fake YouTube university set up by the craziest man in the fucking world,
746900	748600	correctly cites the study.
748600	753100	Heck, even a cursory Google search of the times Joe Biden or Barack Obama have used the number
753100	755400	links to the correct study as the source.
755400	757400	Why did he get the study wrong?
757400	760200	This made me curious, so I tried to figure out why.
760200	765100	My long and arduous search brought me to the Wikipedia page for campus sexual assault.
765100	768300	The first study listed on that page is the one he cited.
768300	770400	I'm not saying this is what happened,
770400	774300	but imagine for a moment Googling campus sexual assault,
774300	777100	and looking at the first source on a page,
777100	780100	and just assuming it's the source of the 1 in 5 statistic,
780100	785000	and just ignoring the parts in that study that cited 1 in 5 numerous times,
785000	786900	and even links to it.
786900	792100	If he had scrolled down just slightly to the third entry on the fucking page,
792100	794400	he would have seen the actual CSA study,
794400	798300	and also that it's described as the source of the 1 in 5 statistic.
798300	801300	Between these two is the study he cited as facts.
801300	804800	Note how it's described numerous times to also be a fucking survey.
804800	806500	I really don't know how he missed that.
806500	808800	So maybe he didn't even read the Wikipedia page.
808800	810500	Who knows what he actually read?
810500	813400	Trying to find something he has read is quite difficult.
813400	814700	In that comment before,
814700	818800	he quotes books that he claimed in livestreams later that he hadn't read.
818800	822400	So he, like, Googles quotes or something to find his evidence?
822400	824100	I could find the quote of him saying this,
824100	826200	but these videos are sometimes several hours long,
826200	827900	and that's too long for my liking!
828800	832400	Speaking of cursory research that fucking anyone can do,
832400	835800	for a long time, this picture of a statue was Carl's avatar,
835800	839100	and the logo he used in his videos when he pauses to talk over them.
839100	841700	I mean, his internet handle is Sargon of Akkad,
841700	845200	and he puts the words Sargon of Akkad next to pictures of the statue,
845200	848500	so obviously he thinks it's a statue of Sargon, right?
848500	849900	But is it?
849900	851400	SPOILERS, IT'S NOT. IT'S FUCKING NOT.
851400	853400	EVEN HIS FUCKING LOGO IS OF THE WRONG PERSON.
853400	856300	The Museum of Iraq, which currently holds the artifact,
856300	859200	simply refers to it as Head of King,
859200	862100	and points out that it's not known who this represents.
862100	865700	It could be a statue of his son or his grandson or another descendant
865700	870200	or even a statue representing the Akkadian lineage itself in a metaphysical way.
870200	873600	The same way, for example, Moe statues represent Polynesian ancestry
873600	875900	without being a literal portrait of anyone.
875900	878400	So, why did he assume this is Sargon?
878400	879400	Well...
879400	883000	Wikipedia says it probably might be.
883000	885300	Well, I mean, if Wikipedia says it!
885300	888000	Interestingly enough, the folks on the talk page of Sargon of Akkad,
888000	892100	the actual historical figure, not the man-baby who doesn't read studies before claiming they prove his right,
892100	894100	discussed how it's impossible to verify,
894100	898400	but that the little evidence we do have implies it's far more likely to be a statue of Naram-Sin,
898400	899600	Sargon's grandson,
899600	905000	and cite a pretty impressive source showing that this is more likely to be the case than it being Sargon,
905000	907300	because a sculpture that we know to be of Naram-Sin,
907300	908800	because its inscription is still intact,
908800	911500	has a very strong resemblance with the other statue.
911500	914200	They only decided to keep the statue on the Sargon page
914200	918000	because there isn't really any other surviving iconography of the Akkadian royalty
918000	920400	and because people, also known as idiots,
920400	923100	for some reason like to assume it's Sargon.
923100	925500	So by probably, the article means...
925500	926700	probably not.
926700	929100	But probably not is good enough for Karl,
929100	933500	and it was good enough for a long time until he apparently noticed this finally and changed it.
933500	936400	In conclusion, if you don't look very well for studies,
936400	938500	misread the data,
938500	942500	ignore the words and pictures surrounding the data,
942500	944900	and ignore people's attempts to correct you,
944900	947600	sexual assault isn't a problem on college campuses!
947600	949500	Take that, feminism!
949600	954300	It's no surprise that so few people's minds have been changed in the face of this sterling logic.
954300	959200	Karl's only recourse was to attempt to have everyone who disagrees with him erased from academia.
960700	964500	Just kidding. Not even Karl would be stupid enough to think that would be a good idea.
967000	968600	Oh, for fuck's sake!
968600	992200	I'd also like to say a special thanks to Aaron Salisbury, Alicia Parker Martell, Bob, Casey Schneibel, Kieran, David Rose, InstantGrat, Jack Hargraves, Jack Harvey, and Jan Anders.
992200	993800	Thank you all very much for watching.
993800	998200	My patrons seem interested in me doing a video about the EU referendum, so that'll be out soon.
998300	1000200	Hopefully before the referendum, I mean.
1000600	1001600	That would be nice.
1002000	1005500	The video about Sargon's petition will be out as soon as some new audio equipment arrives,
1005500	1010400	and I've found the exact Commodore 64 tape I want to steal music from for a thing I'm doing at the end.
1010900	1012200	See you all next time!
1016400	1022000	Oh, and for those of you that have already left an angry comment and downvoted this video because it's critical of Sargon,
1022500	1026100	thanks for helping prove the point I'm going to be making in a future video.
1026600	1027600	Seriously.
1027600	1029800	I knew I could count on you.
