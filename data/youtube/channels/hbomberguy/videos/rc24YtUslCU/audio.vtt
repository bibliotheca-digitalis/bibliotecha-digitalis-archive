00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
You know, quite often I get YouTube comments, messages, askfms, and singing telegrams

00:06.600 --> 00:10.700
telling me the main reason I haven't accepted the Rationals as my true lords and saviors

00:10.700 --> 00:12.600
is because I'm only looking at idiots.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.900
Apparently it's MY fault that the stupidest neoreactionaries and anti-feminists on YouTube

00:16.900 --> 00:21.800
are also the most popular, rising to the top like the WHITEST CREAM.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.700
But I'm sure that's my anti-free-speech, pro-censorship, virtue-signal, regressive-leftist,

00:25.700 --> 00:27.900
white-hating, pro-Spengler bias talking.

00:27.900 --> 00:33.200
There must be some... really actually smart thinkers out there with the real evidence on their side

00:33.200 --> 00:35.300
to back up their beliefs, right?

00:35.300 --> 00:38.200
So let's look at some studies done into supposedly feminist issues

00:38.200 --> 00:42.400
and see what the best and brightest of the internet badass ultra-rationals have to offer.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh, and if for some reason you're upset by trigger warnings,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.200
I invite you to grow up, you big fucking BABY!

00:54.300 --> 00:56.700
♫

00:57.700 --> 01:00.400
One term anti-feminism simply cannot abide is

01:00.400 --> 01:06.500
one-in-five, a term referring to a study released in 2007 with data gathered from two American universities.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.900
The data implies that as many as one in five women on this campus experienced something

01:10.900 --> 01:15.700
that would fall under the legal criminal definition of sexual assault through their years on campus.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.000
The study does have methodological caveats that are worth keeping in mind

01:19.000 --> 01:23.200
if you're using it to draw a conclusion about the general state of campus society nationwide,

01:23.200 --> 01:27.000
being over a short period and only conducted on two campuses, for example.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.600
Two of the people who worked on the study published an article in Time

01:29.600 --> 01:34.000
saying that using one-in-five as representative of campuses nationwide is inappropriate.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.800
However, they do point out that the data is not inconsistent with other similar studies

01:37.800 --> 01:40.900
performed before and after, and that learning what happens on campuses

01:40.900 --> 01:45.200
and perhaps trying to figure out how to deal with it is obviously an issue worth looking at.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.700
This study is most likely the source for Joe Biden and Barack Obama's use of the one-in-five claim in various speeches.

01:50.700 --> 01:56.700
Right now, nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.000
We know the numbers.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.500
One in five of every one of those young women who's dropped off that first day of school

02:04.500 --> 02:07.200
before they finish school will be assaulted.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.100
If you're going to claim that Biden and Obama's use of these figures is reductionist, I would agree with you.

02:12.100 --> 02:16.900
But that is what the data implies, and it's also what the rest of the data implies.

02:16.900 --> 02:20.700
While one in five is obviously an estimate based on incomplete data,

02:20.700 --> 02:23.700
debunking the study is immensely important to reactionaries

02:23.700 --> 02:27.500
because given how colleges do often take steps to try and prevent this behavior—

02:27.500 --> 02:31.700
for example, by telling students that it's not okay to continue fucking someone if they want you to stop—

02:31.700 --> 02:34.900
if they can shoot one of the central studies full of holes, they can create a narrative

02:34.900 --> 02:38.300
in which feminism is using bad science to tell all men they're rapists

02:38.300 --> 02:43.300
and take over campus to push an agenda and they're a cult and something something George Orwell—

02:43.300 --> 02:45.100
because that's the real problem here, right?

02:45.100 --> 02:46.800
That's the thing that needs to be corrected.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.600
There are no other social issues that we could be discussing.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.400
The real issue is, I think people are pretending there's more rape than there is,

02:53.400 --> 02:56.600
and should I really have to stop if someone asks me to?

02:56.600 --> 03:00.000
The real problem is the feminists want me to ask for consent.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.200
Many different totally rational freethinkers have stepped up to the plate to debunk this study,

03:04.200 --> 03:06.800
but to avoid accidentally picking an idiot again,

03:06.800 --> 03:11.800
I picked someone vetted by Reddit and Twitter and YouTube comment sections to be a true rationalist—

03:11.800 --> 03:13.200
Sargon of Akkad.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.700
You can tell he's smart because his scream name is taken from a historical figure.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.600
That basically makes him right already.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.100
At least according to his fans—

03:20.100 --> 03:21.600
and also to the EDL—

03:21.600 --> 03:24.400
I'm gonna call him Carl because that's his name.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.100
Carl debunks 1 in 5 by citing the study and explaining the problem he has with it.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.500
I'll just let the video play and stop when I see a problem.

03:30.500 --> 03:34.700
Our feminist activist will be quoting from sources like this.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.700
Wait, that isn't the study.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.100
That's not the 1 in 5 study.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.800
The one he does cite even specifically references the 1 in 5 study in shots he uses in the video.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
He didn't even get the study right!

03:45.800 --> 03:47.600
The description of this video literally says,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.800
explaining where the claim originated,

03:49.800 --> 03:53.200
while citing the study that didn't originate the claim.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.000
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.400
Heck, let's see how he debunks this one.

03:57.400 --> 04:02.400
A report on the Association of American Universities' campus climate survey

04:02.400 --> 04:05.000
on sexual assault and sexual misconduct.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.700
It's a survey.

04:06.700 --> 04:07.900
Survey.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.600
That makes it bad. You know it's bad because he says it like that.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.600
He seems to have a problem with the fact that the only real way to find out about this stuff is to ask people.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.000
Regardless, the idea that surveys are inherently unscientific is interesting, though.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.500
Keep that in mind for later.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.200
Took that away in your...

04:22.200 --> 04:23.400
brain...

04:23.400 --> 04:24.300
pockets.

04:24.300 --> 04:29.000
He then goes on to claim that this survey stretched the definition of sexual assault.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.900
The first two tactics generally meet legal definitions of rape and sexual battery.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.500
The other two tactics are violation of student codes of conduct.

04:37.500 --> 04:43.600
And it is unsurprisingly this massive inflation of what is and is not sexual assault

04:43.600 --> 04:46.200
that accounts for the one in five figure.

04:46.200 --> 04:52.600
Like they said, half of their categories don't even fall under the legal definition of sexual assault or rape.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.600
Therefore, including that in any results is going to be inherently misleading.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.800
Well, obviously, if you redefine sexual assault to be anything mean you don't like, of course it happens a lot.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.600
Pack your bags, feminists.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.300
Except if you actually read the study, it measures all of these things separately.

05:08.300 --> 05:13.300
I let Carl off for accidentally picking the wrong study, but he could at least read the one he picked.

05:13.300 --> 05:17.800
The study carefully takes pains to point out that it measured all of these things separately

05:17.800 --> 05:20.300
and sorts the data into appropriate tables.

05:20.300 --> 05:25.500
So, if you're looking at women whose report showed they had experienced something deemed a criminal act

05:25.500 --> 05:28.500
and none of the extra stuff, this table shows it.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.800
27.2%.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.300
Which, by the way, is more than one in five.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.300
In fact, it's slightly more than one in four, without expanding the definition.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.600
Now, let's be clear.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.500
Maybe some of these women misremembered or actively lied for some reason because that's something to worry about.

05:45.500 --> 05:50.400
And as mentioned already, there are clear methodological reasons why it would be inappropriate to claim

05:50.400 --> 05:55.700
these statistics are accurate to all universities or to the places the survey was conducted as a whole.

05:55.700 --> 06:00.600
But even accounting for all of this, 27.2% is quite an alarming percentage.

06:00.600 --> 06:05.700
And it's also quite important to point out that the two separate studies, conducted by separate groups,

06:05.700 --> 06:08.100
both yielded rather similar results.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.700
But Carlgon didn't notice this.

06:09.700 --> 06:15.200
Instead, he concludes that clearly the study is biased claptrap that should be ignored and paid no heed whatsoever.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.400
After all, it's a survey.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.900
And finally, these surveys are not facts.

06:20.900 --> 06:25.600
So, what alternative evidence does he offer to show what's really happening on campus is in reality?

06:25.600 --> 06:27.100
Because I'm rational.

06:27.100 --> 06:31.500
Simple. He signs a report by the Department of Justice showing that the numbers are actually lower.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.500
And you can trust this one because Carl's sure it's factual.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.400
Because as we've just seen, he's so good at reading studies.

06:37.400 --> 06:44.000
"...rape and sexual assault victimization rates among college-age females between 1995 and 2013.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.200
For young women enrolled in college, this went down to 6.1 per thousand students.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.100
This is less than 1%.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.800
These are facts we can be certain of."

06:54.800 --> 06:56.400
Yeah, these are the facts.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.700
Unlike the sur- wait, this one was a survey as well!

06:59.700 --> 07:05.700
It literally says the findings are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.400
It shows it just beneath the section he shows in his video.

07:09.400 --> 07:16.600
Did he not read any more than the first paragraph of the first page of the study he claims is the factual one?

07:16.600 --> 07:18.200
What the fuck?!

07:18.200 --> 07:24.700
He backs up his claim with studies using the same methods he previously decried as not worth looking at.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.200
Because this time the data shows what he wants it to show.

07:28.200 --> 07:34.400
Just to double-check, let's see how many times this 20-page document uses the word survey.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.500
94.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.700
The word survey is used an average of 4.7 times a page!

07:41.700 --> 07:45.300
You would have to not read the entire study to miss this!

07:45.300 --> 07:48.900
But alongside being literally factually wrong,

07:48.900 --> 07:53.700
there are factors that lead me to believe that Carl didn't even read the first page of this study.

07:53.700 --> 08:00.800
The only thing that is left out of these facts are the number of unreported sexual assaults and rapes.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.500
What? No!

08:02.500 --> 08:09.200
The report did document what percentage of victims never reported the incident on the first page!

08:09.200 --> 08:11.600
You can even see it in Carl's video!

08:11.600 --> 08:13.100
It's right there!

08:13.100 --> 08:17.300
It takes up so much of the first page that missing it is practically impossible!

08:17.300 --> 08:20.800
You'd have to be either illiterate or lying to make that claim!

08:20.800 --> 08:25.100
Carl is literally showcasing how little he reads of these studies!

08:25.100 --> 08:28.700
It would almost be a relief to discover that Spleiva Darunia was the only idiot

08:28.700 --> 08:32.200
pretending to use sources to back up his pseudoscientific ideas.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.200
But surprise, surprise, the guy who hung out with him for almost a year

08:35.200 --> 08:38.800
before finally picking up on how he's a fucking crazy person does it too.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.900
And of course, like his fellow true smarty rational,

08:41.900 --> 08:45.700
Sargon also managed to talk for 25 minutes about what he thinks of a film

08:45.700 --> 08:48.500
he'd seen at most two and a half minutes of in a trailer.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.100
So he'd seen about as large a portion of the actual Ghostbusters film

08:52.100 --> 08:54.800
as he seems to have read of this fucking study.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.700
It's a survey, unlike this survey, which was regular.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.900
You can trust surveys, but you can't trust surveys!

09:00.900 --> 09:05.500
So, so far, the best anti-feminist the YouTube Babyman landscape has to offer

09:05.500 --> 09:09.600
has cited the wrong study, got the facts about the data in the study wrong,

09:09.600 --> 09:15.000
decried that it's a survey, cited another survey as fact while not noticing it's a survey,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.100
and then failed to understand why the data's actually different from the previous one.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.900
Anyone out there convinced yet?

09:20.900 --> 09:25.400
I leave now as the time to abandon feminism in the face of these superior reasoning skills.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.500
Now's the time to be clear I'm not being very original here.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.200
Someone else, a guy called Garrett, already pointed out a lot of these issues

09:32.200 --> 09:34.700
far more comprehensively in a video of his own.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.200
Dude, if you're going to attempt to misrepresent studies,

09:37.200 --> 09:39.200
at least try to not be so sloppy about it.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.300
People claim that such studies are broadening the definition of rape or sexual assault

09:43.300 --> 09:44.800
when they actually aren't.

09:44.800 --> 09:50.100
I personally think that Sargon wouldn't be lazy enough to not even read the first page of a study.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.900
But then again, there is of course a chance I'm wrong about that.

09:52.900 --> 09:57.100
So, either he is intentionally misrepresenting the information he's using in his video,

09:57.100 --> 09:59.300
or he is being mind-blowingly sloppy.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.300
These are facts we can be certain of.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.000
Nope. They're estimates.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.800
Maybe you didn't realize that, but again, it is mentioned in the very image you used in your video.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.700
Oops.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.600
He covers everything I covered here and more,

10:10.600 --> 10:13.300
and explains how to read studies in a really useful way.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.900
I would highly recommend you watch it.

10:14.900 --> 10:18.400
So clearly, Sargon has had the chance to defend his argument and argue his case

10:18.400 --> 10:20.300
and explain how actually we're missing something,

10:20.300 --> 10:23.900
or even realize his errors and admit his reading of studies could do with some improvement.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.300
Oh, fucking hell.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.300
Can you not summarize this in under five minutes?

10:28.300 --> 10:31.600
I don't have the patience to sit through over half an hour of this.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.900
Well, that sounds reasonable.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.200
["Laughter"]

10:35.200 --> 10:39.100
When I started working on this video, looking at the statistics touted by anti-feminists,

10:39.200 --> 10:44.300
I was expecting to finally see the proof, evidence, reasoning, and love of critical discussion

10:44.300 --> 10:49.400
anti-feminists always say they totally want to have, and finally understand their point of view.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.800
I would actually really like to be shown all the sexual assault statistics I've seen are false.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.500
It would be comforting to know it doesn't happen nearly as much as is implied.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.000
But instead, all I've been shown is that to be an anti-feminist,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.700
you have to have no understanding of how to read studies,

11:02.700 --> 11:07.600
or what words mean, and insist on remaining that way by ignoring criticism.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.500
Ironically, while he doesn't have the time to watch and respond to a genuine good-faith attempt

11:11.500 --> 11:13.300
to explain the issue with his reasoning,

11:13.300 --> 11:17.700
Sargon does have the time to watch my comedy video where I laugh at skull men,

11:17.700 --> 11:21.600
and insist I take them more seriously, and give proper rebuttals.

11:21.600 --> 11:26.100
So, there's plenty of time to find criticism you don't deem thoughtful enough to complain about—

11:26.100 --> 11:27.900
in fact, he does this every fucking week—

11:27.900 --> 11:33.800
but he somehow couldn't find the time to respond to actual, real criticism, and raise the discussion.

11:33.900 --> 11:37.900
Hmm, I wonder if this is where the bias Sargon keeps complaining about is coming from.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.900
At the very least, he's right about one thing.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.600
It is very easy to laugh at David Sorrini.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
I agree with that one.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.800
It takes a lot of effort to take his ideas seriously for long stretches of time I won't watch,

11:47.800 --> 11:51.300
because I don't look for ideas that challenge me, because that's how being rational works.

11:51.300 --> 11:55.900
He also complains that the video he hasn't watched should have talked about a video someone else made,

11:55.900 --> 12:00.200
which is a pretty weird fucking tactic to use to defend your claims.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.800
Also, he did touch on it.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.600
So, you know,

12:02.600 --> 12:05.600
MAYBE WATCH THE VIDEO BEFORE RESPONDING TO IT!

12:05.600 --> 12:07.800
I HAVE TO POINT THIS OUT NOW, APPARENTLY!

12:07.800 --> 12:12.700
Didn't dig deeply enough is I can only assume code for was objectively wrong.

12:12.700 --> 12:17.200
You know, I still don't get why he arrived at the wrong study like this.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.800
How did he miss the actual CSA study and arrive at this one?

12:20.800 --> 12:26.900
Even PragerU, a fake YouTube university set up by the craziest man in the fucking world,

12:26.900 --> 12:28.600
correctly cites the study.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.100
Heck, even a cursory Google search of the times Joe Biden or Barack Obama have used the number

12:33.100 --> 12:35.400
links to the correct study as the source.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.400
Why did he get the study wrong?

12:37.400 --> 12:40.200
This made me curious, so I tried to figure out why.

12:40.200 --> 12:45.100
My long and arduous search brought me to the Wikipedia page for campus sexual assault.

12:45.100 --> 12:48.300
The first study listed on that page is the one he cited.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.400
I'm not saying this is what happened,

12:50.400 --> 12:54.300
but imagine for a moment Googling campus sexual assault,

12:54.300 --> 12:57.100
and looking at the first source on a page,

12:57.100 --> 13:00.100
and just assuming it's the source of the 1 in 5 statistic,

13:00.100 --> 13:05.000
and just ignoring the parts in that study that cited 1 in 5 numerous times,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.900
and even links to it.

13:06.900 --> 13:12.100
If he had scrolled down just slightly to the third entry on the fucking page,

13:12.100 --> 13:14.400
he would have seen the actual CSA study,

13:14.400 --> 13:18.300
and also that it's described as the source of the 1 in 5 statistic.

13:18.300 --> 13:21.300
Between these two is the study he cited as facts.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.800
Note how it's described numerous times to also be a fucking survey.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.500
I really don't know how he missed that.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.800
So maybe he didn't even read the Wikipedia page.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.500
Who knows what he actually read?

13:30.500 --> 13:33.400
Trying to find something he has read is quite difficult.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.700
In that comment before,

13:34.700 --> 13:38.800
he quotes books that he claimed in livestreams later that he hadn't read.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.400
So he, like, Googles quotes or something to find his evidence?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.100
I could find the quote of him saying this,

13:44.100 --> 13:46.200
but these videos are sometimes several hours long,

13:46.200 --> 13:47.900
and that's too long for my liking!

13:48.800 --> 13:52.400
Speaking of cursory research that fucking anyone can do,

13:52.400 --> 13:55.800
for a long time, this picture of a statue was Carl's avatar,

13:55.800 --> 13:59.100
and the logo he used in his videos when he pauses to talk over them.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.700
I mean, his internet handle is Sargon of Akkad,

14:01.700 --> 14:05.200
and he puts the words Sargon of Akkad next to pictures of the statue,

14:05.200 --> 14:08.500
so obviously he thinks it's a statue of Sargon, right?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.900
But is it?

14:09.900 --> 14:11.400
SPOILERS, IT'S NOT. IT'S FUCKING NOT.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.400
EVEN HIS FUCKING LOGO IS OF THE WRONG PERSON.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.300
The Museum of Iraq, which currently holds the artifact,

14:16.300 --> 14:19.200
simply refers to it as Head of King,

14:19.200 --> 14:22.100
and points out that it's not known who this represents.

14:22.100 --> 14:25.700
It could be a statue of his son or his grandson or another descendant

14:25.700 --> 14:30.200
or even a statue representing the Akkadian lineage itself in a metaphysical way.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.600
The same way, for example, Moe statues represent Polynesian ancestry

14:33.600 --> 14:35.900
without being a literal portrait of anyone.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.400
So, why did he assume this is Sargon?

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
Well...

14:39.400 --> 14:43.000
Wikipedia says it probably might be.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.300
Well, I mean, if Wikipedia says it!

14:45.300 --> 14:48.000
Interestingly enough, the folks on the talk page of Sargon of Akkad,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.100
the actual historical figure, not the man-baby who doesn't read studies before claiming they prove his right,

14:52.100 --> 14:54.100
discussed how it's impossible to verify,

14:54.100 --> 14:58.400
but that the little evidence we do have implies it's far more likely to be a statue of Naram-Sin,

14:58.400 --> 14:59.600
Sargon's grandson,

14:59.600 --> 15:05.000
and cite a pretty impressive source showing that this is more likely to be the case than it being Sargon,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.300
because a sculpture that we know to be of Naram-Sin,

15:07.300 --> 15:08.800
because its inscription is still intact,

15:08.800 --> 15:11.500
has a very strong resemblance with the other statue.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.200
They only decided to keep the statue on the Sargon page

15:14.200 --> 15:18.000
because there isn't really any other surviving iconography of the Akkadian royalty

15:18.000 --> 15:20.400
and because people, also known as idiots,

15:20.400 --> 15:23.100
for some reason like to assume it's Sargon.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.500
So by probably, the article means...

15:25.500 --> 15:26.700
probably not.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.100
But probably not is good enough for Karl,

15:29.100 --> 15:33.500
and it was good enough for a long time until he apparently noticed this finally and changed it.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.400
In conclusion, if you don't look very well for studies,

15:36.400 --> 15:38.500
misread the data,

15:38.500 --> 15:42.500
ignore the words and pictures surrounding the data,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.900
and ignore people's attempts to correct you,

15:44.900 --> 15:47.600
sexual assault isn't a problem on college campuses!

15:47.600 --> 15:49.500
Take that, feminism!

15:49.600 --> 15:54.300
It's no surprise that so few people's minds have been changed in the face of this sterling logic.

15:54.300 --> 15:59.200
Karl's only recourse was to attempt to have everyone who disagrees with him erased from academia.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.500
Just kidding. Not even Karl would be stupid enough to think that would be a good idea.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.600
Oh, for fuck's sake!

16:08.600 --> 16:32.200
I'd also like to say a special thanks to Aaron Salisbury, Alicia Parker Martell, Bob, Casey Schneibel, Kieran, David Rose, InstantGrat, Jack Hargraves, Jack Harvey, and Jan Anders.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.800
Thank you all very much for watching.

16:33.800 --> 16:38.200
My patrons seem interested in me doing a video about the EU referendum, so that'll be out soon.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.200
Hopefully before the referendum, I mean.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
That would be nice.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.500
The video about Sargon's petition will be out as soon as some new audio equipment arrives,

16:45.500 --> 16:50.400
and I've found the exact Commodore 64 tape I want to steal music from for a thing I'm doing at the end.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.200
See you all next time!

16:56.400 --> 17:02.000
Oh, and for those of you that have already left an angry comment and downvoted this video because it's critical of Sargon,

17:02.500 --> 17:06.100
thanks for helping prove the point I'm going to be making in a future video.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.600
Seriously.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.800
I knew I could count on you.
