0	16320	When he's not lecturing the left about how their awful behavior is turning people away
16320	21400	from their ideas and they have the wrong priorities, it makes the left look demented. This is the
21400	26540	reaction of a group of people who have lost all sense of perspective. Or having long-winded
26540	31100	discussions about how the Magic the Gathering feminists have ruined the card game because
31100	35820	he hasn't seen as many tits recently. Carl's busy openly tweeting gay porn at people, the
35820	40700	latest in a long line of what I believe he calls a convincing argument. Unfortunately,
40700	44760	Twitter aren't wise to these fifth-dimensional genius discourse moves and briefly suspended
44760	49260	his account, citing a violation of Twitter's rules of conduct regarding abusive behavior.
49260	54700	Wait, Twitter has those? Well, if it does, it clearly has too many. If a man with hundreds
54700	59260	of thousands of followers can't send unsolicited pornography to people, we're basically living
59260	65140	in a social studies warrior dystopia. The smart, reasonable attention-seekers on InfoWars.Facebook
65140	69700	are very sure it's because he tweeted about how immigration causes crime, which, using
69700	75180	maths, is correct. Since a non-zero percentage of all people in every country commit crimes,
75180	78900	immigration from any country theoretically puts citizens at risk. We need to block immigration
78900	83100	from every co- No, I'm just kidding. Only Muslim ones. Because you know what they're
83420	88100	And that's not racism. Islam is not a race, so it can't possibly be bigoted to assume
88100	92540	that all criminals need to be stopped. I'm rational. Don't criticize me or I'll send
92540	98340	you porn. And in Carl of Sad's defense, he only does this to Nazis and members of
98340	102100	the alt-right in an attempt to get them to stop following him, which is probably an effective
102100	106080	short-term solution. The long-term one, of course, would be to re-evaluate why his claims
106080	110460	keep attracting the agreement of neo-Nazis. It's also weird that all of a sudden having
110460	114660	weirdo fascists on your side is a bad thing. Back when the EDL announced their support
114660	119020	for him, he was all like, if I can get racists to support me, then I win. But it turns out
119020	122540	deliberately making racist homophobes your audience causes them to see you as one of
122540	127140	their own. Weird, that! Usually, the best way to stop ridiculous people from siding
127140	131940	with you is to learn how to read studies and cite facts and evidence to form your arguments.
131940	135300	And maybe refrain from telling members of parliament whether or not you'd rape them
135300	139100	in an attempt to get attention for being edgy. Considering he doesn't even like the people
139100	141980	whose attention it gets him, that would kind of seem obvious, wouldn't it?
141980	148260	Is this what Twitter is now? That's right. Yeah, they ban everyone who's not like this.
148260	152700	That's exactly what Twitter is like. Only if instead of the words in the boxes, it was,
152700	157020	uhâ€¦ I actually feel kind of sorry for the guy. The world seems to be getting worse and
157020	161060	blaming the people who aren't in power doesn't seem to be helping. And he's stuck being
161060	165700	supported by alt-right weirdos he hates despite intentionally pandering to them with videos
165700	169300	about how the leftists are corrupting your children. It might have been good for him
169300	172780	to take a break from tweeting about it all day. You know, chillax a little, maybe get
172780	176100	some good shut-eye. Based on his tweets, he's waking up in the middle of the afternoon and
176100	179900	that's just a bit sad. Instead, he used the time he could have had off from calling
179900	184660	everyone remotely to the left of him a reactionary saddo complaining about nothing to spend five
184660	190060	whole hours simpering about how Twitter hurt his feelings by punishing him for violating
190060	195140	their platform's terms of service. And he had JonTron on, fresh from advertising Ubisoft
195180	199740	games and getting very upset by some tissue paper on a bench to discuss how wrong it is
199740	201740	to get punished for breaking the rules.
225140	230340	That's right, that's right, there's protesters, they were all communists, mate, that's right, sorry, communists.
230340	238940	ðŸŽµLet us all sing together in triumph over...ðŸŽµ
238940	240940	They're fucking communists!
240940	244940	ðŸŽµWe see thee...ðŸŽµ
244940	251140	Oppression test. Can you drive to McDonald's not in hijab and get biggest Big Mac value meal?
251140	253540	If yes, not oppressed.
253580	256620	Oh, boy, that reminds me of my favorite JonTron skit.
256620	259100	Hey, do you remember? Remember the one with all the-

260300	264860	You know Ken, I was thinking about, you know, maybe taking a year off, going back to college, starting my career.
265940	269620	Nonsense, Barbie. You're staying here and having my kids.
270300	272300	Jon, what are you playing?
272660	280240	Nothing! This doesn't happen! Systemic problems aren't real! If you can purchase a Big Mac, you're not oppressed!

288780	291200	I enjoy this thumbnail use for the video also.
291200	296540	It's an attempt to recast his critics as autistic people, reacting in an over-the-top, incoherent manner to his behavior
296720	301160	But it's the thumbnail to a five-hour video where he and a hugbox of people
301440	308620	incoherently rant about how mad they are that the leftists at Twitter punished him for breaking the terms of service.
308620	311580	Oh, yeah sure, everyone else's is the screeching one. Sure.
311580	314920	First they came for Sargon of Akkad, and I said nothing,
314920	319820	because getting suspended for violating Twitter's terms of service is the system functioning like it's supposed to.
319820	324940	And also because he said nothing when one of my videos got taken down and instead expected me to decry when one of his videos
324940	328160	blaming an entire religion for a terrorist attack got demonetized.
328160	331800	Because, in his usual display of understanding of the free market,
331800	335640	no one wanting to advertise on his videos is leftist censorship.
335640	339980	I mean, like, they always got all cultural Marxisms and conspiracy theories, like, no, it's actually not.
340180	341180	No, not at all.
341180	343480	Like, the Frankfurt School is something that existed.
343980	344480	Yeah.
344480	345480	Ha ha ha ha ha!
347280	348880	The Frankfurt School existed!
349480	352880	It's not a conspiracy theory if there was a Frankfurt School!
353080	358580	Apparently, the people who think the Nazi conspiracy theory invented by literal Nazis is a Nazi conspiracy theory
358580	363080	are trying to deny the existence of a very prominent school of social theory.
363280	364580	Sure. Yeah.
365580	372080	Hey, John, I think you might have forgotten that people's right to protest is a fundamental part of American democracy.
372080	374780	They're fucking communists, Jacques!
375180	377080	They're fucking Bolsheviks!
377580	379980	Didn't you see that one guy punch a Nazi?
380180	383080	Basically, anti-fascism is fascism now!
383280	385980	I talk about video games for a living. I can do a...
385980	388380	...meritable critique of political economy.
389280	392180	Check out Far Cry Primal in stores now.
392380	396580	The Frankfurt School exists, so cultural Marxism has to be real!
396880	402180	Does it matter that no one at those protests fucking knows who any of the fucking Frankfurt School are?
402380	405880	You think that lady with the sign knows who Adorno or Horkheimer are?
406080	411680	Is wanting to continue having reproductive rights and healthcare too leftist now, really?
412080	414380	They put tissue paper on a bench!
415680	417380	Buy Far Cry, please!
417980	419980	I'm not melting down, I'm fine!
420280	420980	I'm fine!
422180	425580	Jacques, Mr. Twitter, please, free Calgon.
425880	427980	I hear washing machines live longer with him.
428180	432780	And if you don't let him send porn to people in an attempt to make using your platform unpleasant for them,
432780	435980	then that's basically communist censorship.
439380	442580	Now, it's clear from this chat, and also from a good deal of the rest of their writing,
442580	448780	that these folks think Trump won because the left are weak, whiny snowflakes who just call things racist,
448980	450780	but also because they're too violent.
453180	455980	And also all those people out on the street are fucking communists!
456380	458980	Can't even get the fucking name right, but, I mean,
459180	463580	let's not discount their political discourse just because they have no idea what they're talking about.
464380	467980	Secretly, with all these weird contradictory comments and conspiracy theories,
467980	470780	they've disclosed the actual reason why Trump won.
471580	474180	A lot of people are very stupid.
474580	478180	Carl wants to see the left reformed around what he sees as its core ideals,
478380	483780	which appears to be, uh, not-saying-feminist-no-no words and Islamophobia.
484380	488380	But luckily, his method of reforming the left appears to amount to whining on YouTube
488380	491180	and getting suspended for tweeting porn at people?
491580	493980	So he'll be saving the left in no time!
493980	498380	Imagine thinking the world was going to collapse because of Magic the Gathering feminists,
498780	503780	and deciding that the solution was to say nothing of value very loudly.
504580	509180	In ten years, when you're watching this video from the bottom of a trash can in hiding
509180	513580	because the matriarchy really did take over and are now killing all white men on sight,
513780	516980	remember that a few brave heroes saw this dystopia coming
517180	520380	and tried to prevent it by getting very mad on Twitter.
520780	523780	Also, since I'll definitely be dead by then because I'm both of those things,
524180	526180	thanks, Carl! You could have saved me!
526580	533380	And instead, you yelled the N-word at footage of mentally disabled children on YouTube.
533780	536780	It is not acceptable to call me a retard.
536980	539380	The R-word is the same as every minority slur.
539780	545780	Oh. Well, great job trivialising minority slurs, you nigger-spick-fag-chink-kike-retard.
546180	550780	How dare you tell me you don't appreciate people trivialising the word retarded.
550980	554180	Ah, this is the main priority to have, am I right?
554780	558380	No, just kidding. In the words of a certain definite smart man.
558780	562980	This is the reaction of a group of people who have lost all sense of perspective.
563380	564780	Was that supposed to convince me?
565380	569580	Because I'm a feminist. According to you, I'm the most gullible kind of person there is,
569780	571780	and you didn't even manage to convince me about it.
572180	576780	And now I'm probably dead at the hands of a gender-fluid, femino-marxo-Muslim.
576980	580380	You saw it coming and you could have saved me, but you chose to be shit.
581180	582180	Thanks!
583780	586580	If you can get a Big Mac, you're not oppressed!
587380	589380	You really fucked this one up, didn't you, John?
