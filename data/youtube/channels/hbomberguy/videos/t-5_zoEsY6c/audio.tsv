0	5700	Austin Jorgensen's series Lisa is one of those cult hits,
5700	9900	the kind where it's quite genuinely formed a cult of people who are really into it,
9900	13600	but not many people outside the in-group really know that much about it.
13600	16100	This is probably because it's hard to talk about.
16100	17900	It's got a lot of really funny moments,
17900	21900	some excellent examples of great writing or perfect comedic timing,
21900	23700	but unlike, for example, Undertale,
23700	27800	the story's content has some pretty gruesome and uncomfortable material.
27800	31400	It enters into an artistic territory where you'd need to know someone pretty well
31400	33200	to feel okay recommending it to them.
33200	36000	It explores themes that can be quite difficult to talk about
36000	38700	and which plenty of people quite justifiably don't want to,
38700	42100	and the game is too good at focusing on what it wants to be about
42100	44900	that you can't ignore it and just focus on something else.
44900	48500	There's a process in modern game discourse I like to call memification.
48500	52300	To be a little bit cynical, if you wanted to for easy clicks,
52300	55300	there are some games you can invent reasons to talk about if you need to.
55300	58900	The game's story and themes are loose and friendly and open enough
58900	61500	that you can reapply the critical lens over and over
61500	65300	and always have a new, somewhat facile element to explore for an audience.
65300	67700	You can speculate for all time about some games
67700	70100	if they have certain features that make it easy to do so.
70100	72800	You could even do a needlessly in-depth analysis
72800	76500	of one character's relationship with anime.
76500	78100	No way, that one was mine, wasn't it?
78100	80200	But when someone like that attempts to play Lisa,
80200	85100	a game whose themes are unavoidable and specific and beautiful and horrific and sad,
85100	86900	the best one could say is,
86900	88800	this reminds me of Undertale.
88800	92600	The only way to relate the experience through such a critically dysfunctional perspective
92600	96700	is by using the lens of one of the two or three games you can talk about endlessly
96700	99500	before going back to talking about them endlessly.
99500	102900	Also, um, Lisa came out quite a bit before Undertale.
102900	103700	Just saying, man.
103700	107600	This is not a criticism of Undertale or the pretend-to-think-about-games economy,
107600	110000	although I guess on some level it kind of is both of those.
110000	113100	Rather, I'm laboring to point out that Lisa doesn't get talked about too much
113100	117500	because by its nature, the reasons why it's good can be hard to talk about.
117500	119700	With that in mind, I'm going to talk about it here
119700	122600	and spoil aspects of the plots of all three of the games
122600	125800	while not specifically summarizing them in explicit detail.
125800	129700	I would highly recommend pausing the video here and playing the games for yourself.
129700	131500	They're all either cheap or free,
131500	133100	so there isn't much of an excuse not to,
133100	136000	and I don't want to preemptively ruin your experience.
136000	138400	See you in, I don't know, 20 hours?
138400	141900	♪♪
141900	145800	Most people probably at least vaguely know of Yume Nikki or Dream Diary,
145800	148400	a free game made in an early version of RPG Maker
148400	151800	in which you control a girl named Madotsuki who refuses to leave her room.
151800	154400	Instead, she can go to bed and enter her dreams.
154400	156100	The game is light on plot,
156100	160700	instead relying on exploration and curiosity about the dream worlds you visit and how they work.
160700	163000	You can collect items which have some uses,
163000	166100	but I wouldn't really say the game has puzzles, per se.
166100	169500	It functions more as a dream itself, floating from area to area
169500	172700	as interesting and sometimes random events happen at you.
172700	175500	The game's well-known largely because of some of these events,
175500	178700	like when hitting a light switch sometimes makes this face appear.
178700	181400	♪♪
181400	184800	This face probably made Yume Nikki popular,
184800	187500	and this has a 1 in 64 chance of even happening.
187500	189500	I, uh, actually had to steal this footage.
189500	191200	While the game doesn't really have a plot,
191200	195400	it has buckets of story if you feel like interpreting the ideas it throws at you.
195400	197600	Consistent imagery of car crash victims,
197600	200900	grasping hands, staring eyes, being chased,
200900	204100	the sudden outbursts of quite scary visuals and music.
204100	207000	The reasons Madotsuki doesn't want to go out into the world for real
207000	209400	are made astonishingly clear in her dreams.
209400	212800	The game is, really, an exploration of one character's psyche
212800	215700	and what they think about in their most unguarded moments.
215700	218100	People think they can escape into their dreams,
218100	220100	but you bring your mind with you,
220100	223700	and if the thing you're trying to escape from had such a big impact on you,
223700	225400	you're not getting away so easily.
225400	228600	While the game is often praised for being weird or random,
228600	231200	Yume Nikki has a good deal of clarity of purpose
231200	232600	and probably resonates with people
232600	236300	because the experiences and ideas it explores are almost universal.
236300	240400	Almost everyone knows something bad could happen to them if they went outside,
240400	242700	so playing to the paranoia that can come from that
242700	244900	reaches a lot of people in parts of themselves
244900	246400	they don't often realize are there.
246400	249500	Yume Nikki was pretty impactful for a free RPG Maker game.
249500	253400	There's several fan games and even more original but overtly inspired works,
253400	256400	and one of them is Lisa, now called Lisa the First.
262400	266900	Lisa is a story about a girl trapped in an abusive home trying to imagine her escape,
266900	270500	but even in her own imagination, her experiences follow her everywhere.
270500	273600	The similarities are already clear, but the differences are interesting.
273600	277600	Trying to find an escape does involve collecting and using various items to progress,
277600	280000	which is a little more direct than how Yume Nikki does it,
280000	282200	but the themes are also much more direct,
282200	284100	making them somewhat more impactful.
284100	287300	Almost every character is portrayed by Lisa's abusive father,
287300	291000	and trying to play to the bizarre whims of this rather singular cast
291000	293500	is in its own way kind of depressing and scary.
293500	295800	I'd recommend people play as much of the game as they can
295800	297900	until they find a puzzle they don't know how to solve
297900	300900	or get sick of dying to the spiders with the father's face on them
300900	303800	and then watch a playthrough of someone who knows what they're doing on YouTube.
303800	305500	It doesn't really hold up as a game,
305500	309000	but as a story, as an exploration of a mind, as an atmosphere,
309000	311200	it's emotionally quite an experience.
311200	313900	An idea that starts here and prevails throughout the series
313900	317400	and is one of its best features is the reuse of music from previous areas,
317400	318600	but at different speeds.
327200	329400	These stories put you in the mind of characters
329400	331800	whose psyche is damaged by their experiences,
331800	335200	and having even the music second-guess your memory of how it sounds
335200	336700	is really disconcerting.
336700	339100	It's cool getting the opportunity to see a work
339100	341200	very openly inspired by something else,
341200	343900	but also full of elements unique to itself.
343900	346400	Or should I say you-may-neek to itself?
346400	347400	What am I talking about?
347400	350600	The ending terminates disturbingly with this game over screen,
350600	353100	and this is actually the last we ever physically see of Lisa
353100	355100	in a series named for her,
355100	357000	though characters have visions of her everywhere
357000	359400	and her presence looms large in the rest of the story.
369100	373300	♪
373300	376400	Lisa, the Painful, also made in a version of RPG Maker,
376400	378800	has a very different approach entirely to storytelling
378800	380700	and more traditional RPG elements,
380700	383500	and what's surprising about it is that this doesn't distract
383500	385500	from giving the player an emotional through-line.
385500	389300	RPGs have a tendency to sharply divide their gameplay and story.
389300	392300	You level your characters and gather equipment and items and fight
392300	395300	and then reach the next story beat in the form of a cutscene.
395300	399000	Quite often you see fans of the expansive scope and story of RPGs,
399000	401800	but who aren't hugely into the parts where they have to battle monsters
401800	403600	or level grind between those bits,
403600	406100	or the opposite where they might even skip the story
406100	408000	to get to the part that engages them better,
408000	409300	the actual gameplay.
409300	412200	If you like both, you kind of have to like them separately
412200	413700	on different levels from one another
413700	416700	because they're ultimately very disparate aspects of the game.
416700	419600	The Painful's greatest quality is that it does everything it can
419600	421600	to be a synthesis of both of these elements,
421600	423700	making them complement each other so directly
423700	426100	that you can no longer really delineate them at all.
426200	428300	All the most involving story moments
428300	430700	also have direct importance on gameplay.
430700	432800	Losing all your characters or a party member
432800	434300	or having to play Russian roulette
434300	435900	and risk literally losing characters
435900	438900	to random chance to continue can be devastating
438900	440600	in the same way that in several battles
440600	442900	it's possible for a character to straight-up get killed
442900	443900	instead of KO'd.
443900	447800	♪
447800	450200	♪
450200	453300	By inflicting all the deaths and loss of the story
453300	454600	on the player mechanically,
454600	457200	by genuinely taking away everything they'd found
457200	458500	or characters they play with,
458500	460500	they're forcing the player to experience
460500	463100	the story aspects of the game on a direct level.
463100	464400	When something bad happens,
464400	466600	it's not just bad because you theoretically care
466600	467700	about these characters.
467700	470200	It's bad because you need those people
470200	471900	and you want those things.
471900	473600	Stop taking my things!
473600	476100	Speaking of things, those things are important.
476100	477400	Take, for example, firebombs.
477400	478500	They do a ton of damage
478500	480400	and inflict the fire effect on your enemies
480400	482300	and are very useful in boss battles
482300	484500	or with bigger fights against larger groups
484500	486900	or if you've already lost a lot of party members.
486900	490000	You might actually genuinely need the items you can find
490000	491400	as opposed to a lot of RPGs
491400	493200	where most of the stuff feels optional
493200	495400	or just, like, another potion or something.
495400	497200	This causes the player to invest more
497200	498700	in trying to find these things
498700	500200	which makes the game more engaging
500200	502700	and very effectively puts you into the role
502700	504900	of someone scavenging a broken wasteland
504900	506300	for anything of value.
506300	508900	I made a video last year exploring ludonarrative,
508900	511100	the idea that while games can have stories,
511100	513400	the actual story was the player's experience
513400	515300	of the game itself through its mechanics
515300	518500	and really engaging games forge an emotional perspective
518500	519600	for the player to occupy
519600	521500	through good execution of those mechanics
521500	525100	and Lisa might be the best game I've ever seen at this.
525100	527600	It's one of few games where I've had a bad outcome,
527600	529400	lost someone permanently in a hard fight
529400	530900	a long way off from my last save
530900	533700	or almost all of my party to Russian roulette
533700	535900	and continued because I'd come so far
535900	537600	and didn't want to have to go all the way back
537600	540400	or worse off, had no idea how much worse it would be
540400	541600	if I tried again.
541700	544000	I save scum like a madman in games when I can,
544000	545800	like I have a folder on my hard drive
545800	548800	full of Darkest Dungeon and XCOM saves just in case
548800	551800	but Lisa makes pressing on despite what comes by you
551800	553300	feel like the right thing to do
553300	556000	and always makes it inconvenient enough
556000	558000	that the alternative, loading a save,
558000	560700	feels like a punishment itself that you want to avoid.
560700	562700	You have to press on because the last save point
562700	563800	was way back there
563800	566500	and who knows how many people you'll lose next time.
566500	568200	There are several points where the player is told
568200	570600	to make a choice between losing everything they have
570600	572900	or a person's life or one of Brad's arms.
572900	575600	These choices aren't reversible and can't be worked around.
575600	577800	Losing one or both arms permanently alters
577800	580200	the mechanics and abilities of the one party member
580200	581400	you'll always have,
581400	583000	losing a party member whose abilities
583000	584800	you probably need to survive,
584800	587000	losing all the firebombs and equipment
587000	588300	keeping you alive.
588300	590100	These are all choices that are difficult
590100	592900	and each genuinely make the game harder.
592900	595400	You actually want, because of the game's mechanics,
595400	597200	to keep all of these people
597200	599700	because they're relevant not to the game's story
599700	602200	but to your ability to get through the game
602200	604200	and this means being forced to choose
604200	607500	is more painful than most other decisions in video games.
607500	609300	If these characters were just other characters
609300	611000	in the story that was also happening
611000	613800	while I was playing an unrelated RPG in fights,
613800	615100	this wouldn't have mattered at all,
615100	617200	but when someone threatens Terry,
617200	619700	your best friend, more on Terry later,
619700	621500	that means something.
621500	623900	These characters have mechanical value to the player
623900	626500	who might well have come to rely on them in fights.
626500	628700	Fascinatingly, most of the characters in your party
628700	631400	in Lisa don't matter to the main story whatsoever,
631400	633400	but I cared more about their survival
633400	635500	because they were important to me.
635500	637500	Having to choose to go without items to keep them
637500	639300	or learn to press on without them
639300	641200	because losing all your healing items
641200	643500	and money and firebombs just isn't manageable
643500	646100	is a real choice that you have to account for.
646100	648900	I can imagine having characters or items taken away
648900	650700	being frustrating for some players,
650700	653400	but it's absolutely fitting to this one story
653400	656700	and I do think that frustration is itself compelling.
656700	659100	The same way that having to send Simpsons hentai
659100	661000	to the brothel to keep them from losing their mind
661000	663000	completely was in Darkest Dungeon.
663000	664800	There's also a lot of random events
664800	667000	that trigger when you sleep to recover your health,
667000	668900	events like losing party members
668900	670000	and having to get them back
670000	671800	or everyone getting badly poisoned
671800	673200	or just stuff getting stolen.
673200	675800	These sorts of things create a quite genuine paranoia
675800	678800	in the player because, again, you want all that stuff.
678800	681800	You learn to only take the risk when you really need to,
681800	684300	and this paranoia puts you into the same sort of mindset
684400	686800	as Brad who sees Lisa everywhere,
686800	688400	looking down and judging him.
688400	691200	This, again, builds on a mechanic from Yume Nikki.
691200	692800	Random events happened in that game,
692800	695700	but they didn't affect the gameplay all that much
695700	697600	and they didn't even really affect the story
697600	699200	unless you're a pretentious weirdo
699200	700700	who likes to read into things.
700700	703200	Lisa builds a universe where you can randomly lose
703200	706500	someone important to you and that's scary and threatening
706500	709000	and makes you afraid to go to sleep in the game,
709000	711300	and while that's not technically a fair mechanic,
711300	713500	it's a powerful mechanic
713500	715300	and that's actually more important
715300	717200	than the game being balanced or fair.
717200	720000	The gameplay and story exist to get across the same ideas
720000	721500	and do it by affecting each other
721500	723900	in much more direct ways than most RPGs.
723900	725300	There's even a section where,
725300	727200	upon being told to choose between losing
727200	729700	what will probably be at that point your second arm
729700	731600	or losing all your items,
731600	733600	you have the third option of asking the character
733600	735100	why they're doing this to you,
735100	737300	and while you're briefly offered the chance
737300	739000	of seeing past this facade,
739000	741800	he then takes both your arm and all your items
741800	744100	as a seemingly purposeful attack on games
744100	745300	that offer easy ways out,
745300	747400	where you can sweet-talk your way past a choice
747400	748500	that it should have been hard.
748500	750100	The player is punished for believing
750100	751400	it would be so simple.
751400	754000	While it would have been easy to load a save here,
754000	755000	the first time through the game,
755000	757100	it felt so right for this to have happened,
757100	760200	to be punished for trying to avoid making a hard decision,
760200	762200	that I pressed on to the end regardless.
762200	764500	The game's use of tons of different status effects
764500	765800	with their own particular challenges
765800	767700	is also really fun, by the way.
767700	769100	They can be devastating,
769100	771000	meaning the player has to work to deal with them
771000	772400	instead of trying to muscle through it
772400	773900	by being higher leveled
773900	775700	or dealing as much damage as they can
775700	776700	and hoping that's enough,
776700	778700	so fights become engaging questions
778700	780100	that demand an answer.
780100	781900	Do I do the most highly damaging attack,
781900	784400	or do I try and stun them or knock them down?
784400	786500	I played a lot of RPGs when I was a stupid kid
786500	788300	or still more as a stupid adult
788300	791400	without ever really bothering to deal with status effects,
791400	793100	using attacks that dealt the most damage
793100	795500	and maybe using health items or phoenix downs,
795500	797300	interacting less with the mechanics
797300	799000	and having less fun because the game
799000	801100	hadn't really made me, conditioning me
801100	803300	to play it in a less fun or interesting way.
803300	805700	Being made to plan around enemies
805700	807300	which deal interesting status effects
807300	809400	and learning to have to use your own effectively
809400	810800	because otherwise you'll die
810800	813300	makes this basically the best RPG experience
813300	814600	I've ever actually had.
814600	816700	The game teaches you the importance of statuses
816700	818200	in a really straightforward way.
818200	820000	Your first party member, Terry Hintz,
820000	822700	is so poor at fighting that it's played for a joke.
822700	825100	This means one of the two moves you get every turn
825100	828100	at the start of the game is free to be wholly concerned
828100	830700	with using items and abilities that involve healing,
830700	833300	restoring TP and SP, or verbal bash
833300	836000	which can make enemies start crying and deal 50% damage
836000	838900	or get pissed and become far less likely to hit people
838900	841700	but also much more likely to hit for critical damage.
841700	844000	Oh, and sometimes they can also hit themselves
844000	845300	for massive damage too.
845300	848100	Terry Hintz might be genuinely one of the best pieces
848100	850100	of game design in the last 10 years.
850100	851800	Instead of, as in lots of RPGs,
851800	853300	handing you decent damage dealers
853300	855600	and then making the player only consider status effects
855600	857500	and healing when it's absolutely necessary
857500	860100	or when a designated healer class comes along,
860100	862000	the second half of your starting party
862000	863900	is functionally unable to hurt anyone
863900	866000	so you're handed an opportunity to figure out
866000	868200	how to make effective use of status effects
868200	869800	and items as early on as possible
869800	871700	and because of the game's difficulty,
871700	873500	if you don't, you're basically screwed
873500	875600	so you're forced to learn how to play
875600	878000	but in a subtle and suggestive way.
878000	879900	You can see that sort of consideration happening
879900	881600	in other aspects of design too.
881600	883500	One of the first key items to continue,
883500	886100	a child's bicycle because this game's great,
886200	887600	is only accessible through an enemy
887600	888800	that you'll need a full party
888800	890700	and a couple of firebombs to defeat.
890700	892300	Beating the boss means teaching you
892300	893800	the value of these items,
893800	894900	which makes scrounging for them
894900	896600	and holding onto them feel worth it
896600	898100	and deciding to use one in a fight
898100	899500	becomes a calculated risk
899500	901500	because you might have needed that later.
901500	903200	It makes managing to find some hidden
903200	904900	in the wild feel incredible
904900	907200	and, yes, it makes being forced to choose
907200	909400	between losing an arm and all of your things
909400	911600	into a genuinely nail-biting decision
911600	913600	because they're so goddamn useful.
913600	915300	I don't think I've ever felt so attached
915300	917600	to an expendable resource in a video game before.
917600	920100	This is, quite simply, genius.
920100	921700	And then when you do get the bike,
921700	923400	you'll notice that you can't move left with it
923400	924800	and drop off because your way is blocked
924800	928500	by this, uh, sports...board on a stick.
928500	931200	♪
931200	932600	You have to move right again.
932600	934100	Now, you probably already equipped it
934100	935100	because it's a new item,
935100	936800	so you pass into the other screen
936800	938700	and you naturally go too quick to see this gap
938700	941000	and you go over it thinking you'll drop down
941000	942300	but instead you hop over it
942300	944400	teaching you instantly what the bike does.
944500	946300	This little section,
946300	948300	this little section with this guy
948300	951200	and this bike is a very subtle tutorial
951200	953000	not just for how to use this item
953000	954700	but for the entire gameplay loop
954700	956000	that leads to getting it,
956000	958000	making careful use of items,
958000	959800	party members best serve using items
959800	962200	instead of attacking, building a party,
962200	965300	and gathering the resources to afford to build a party.
965300	967100	The game makes a joke about tutorials
967100	969200	having silly signs Terry left up
969200	971900	that teach basic stuff and mostly glorify Terry
971900	973400	but then it goes one further
973400	976600	and teaches you how to play it seemingly effortlessly.
976600	978900	Honestly, game designers like this
978900	980800	should be running our school system.
980800	983500	There's also almost no fluff to the game's mechanics.
983500	985500	The game's currency, dirty magazines,
985500	986900	hey, it's a world without women.
986900	988500	What else is gonna represent value?
988500	989800	is pretty rare.
989800	991300	There's not many to find in the world
991300	992200	or through side quests
992200	994100	and outside of a few specific areas,
994100	996100	there's no real way to grind them either.
996100	998700	There's a finite amount of people and mutants to fight
998700	1000900	and almost all of them are unique characters
1000900	1002900	so since outside of grinding,
1002900	1005300	there's basically a precise amount of mags,
1005300	1006900	you can't buy everything you want
1006900	1009500	and don't have easy access to infinite healing items.
1009500	1010800	You have to ration them out,
1010800	1013600	make careful use of characters with heal abilities,
1013600	1015400	occasionally risk sleeping,
1015400	1018300	use the very limited firebomb resources in tougher fights,
1018300	1020400	and somehow in the middle of all this
1020400	1022900	afford to get new items and party members.
1022900	1026400	There's basically no free or simple choices in Lisa
1026400	1027900	and this makes almost every decision
1027900	1030100	in every encounter nail-biting.
1030100	1032000	It's very rare that games come along
1032000	1034600	that invoke this kind of anxiety in players.
1034600	1037500	Design-wise, Lisa equals XCOM or Darkest Dungeon
1037500	1039600	for its mechanical tightness and deadliness
1039600	1042200	and for its emotional tautness too.
1042200	1044400	It's also incredibly thematically interesting
1044400	1045700	to have so many things threatened
1045700	1047100	to get in the way of survival.
1047100	1049000	Characters being unable to perform at their best
1049000	1051500	because they're crying or drunk or hungover
1051500	1052900	or bleeding or depressed
1052900	1054700	or going through withdrawal symptoms
1054700	1056800	ties directly into the story of the game,
1056800	1058500	a story about characters whose judgment
1058500	1060400	is poorly compromised by trauma
1060400	1062900	or bad experiences or drug abuse.
1062900	1065700	Taking a step forward always costs money or items
1065700	1067200	or often a character's life.
1067200	1069000	The Lisa games are all about this sense
1069000	1071800	of losing pieces of yourself to a traumatic world,
1071800	1073000	often literally,
1073000	1075600	and trying to escape the worst of its effects
1075600	1077100	to limited results.
1077100	1078300	Some of the characters you fight
1078300	1079700	are quite clearly manifestations
1079700	1081600	of Brad's joy-altered psyche
1081600	1083300	giving life to his imagination.
1083300	1085000	The spiders you fight quite a lot in the painful
1085000	1087100	are very similar to the ones Lisa had to face
1087100	1089500	with the same man's face on them, no less.
1089500	1092100	In a setting like this one with a story like this one,
1092100	1094700	it makes sense to be confronted very often with scenarios
1094700	1096100	where everyone's just a little bit
1096100	1097400	too out of their right mind
1097400	1099200	to deal with what's happening to them.
1099200	1100300	Speaking of trauma,
1100300	1102100	the story of the painful is fascinating
1102100	1104200	in how it tackles similar ideas to the original
1104200	1105700	but in a more active way.
1105700	1108200	The first was a very internal conflict,
1108200	1109700	the main characters trying and failing
1109700	1112200	in their own imagination to escape an abusive life
1112200	1114900	and try to at least find some peace and calm
1114900	1116100	within themselves,
1116100	1117800	but instead they're repeatedly confronted
1117800	1120600	with their abuser and horrific manifestations of them
1120600	1122000	and what they inflicted on them.
1122000	1124000	I think the painful takes a more interesting
1124000	1125400	and considered road.
1125400	1127000	While you're trapped almost completely
1127000	1128800	in Brad's perception of his world,
1128800	1130200	his actions are real
1130200	1132200	and have consequences that affect others.
1132200	1134400	His choices in how he dealt with his trauma,
1134400	1135500	how he raised Buddy,
1135500	1137500	and how he reacts when she's taken,
1137500	1139600	these are all reactions to his experiences
1139600	1141100	and how they shaped his view of the world
1141100	1142200	and how to act in it.
1142200	1144200	I've spoken about the game's difficult choices,
1144200	1145500	but what's equally informative
1145500	1147900	is the places where the game takes choice away from you
1147900	1149600	or presents you with false choices
1149600	1151800	or doesn't even point out the alternatives
1151800	1153200	that simply didn't occur to Brad
1153200	1154900	because of the person he's become,
1154900	1156600	not entirely of his own volition.
1156600	1159100	Brad blames himself for what happened to Lisa,
1159100	1162100	becomes a martial artist as a post-hoc self-defense mechanism
1162100	1163300	against the abuse he suffered,
1163300	1165700	and raises Buddy the best he can,
1165700	1167300	but the best he can is to shelter her
1167300	1169400	from a world of people that hurt him and his sister
1169400	1170500	when they were young.
1170500	1172200	This itself paves the way for Buddy
1172200	1174100	to become the person she ends up being.
1174200	1175700	When she's kidnapped from Brad's care,
1175700	1177400	or perhaps to put it a better way,
1177400	1179200	escapes from Brad's care,
1179200	1181300	Brad immediately takes this as a justification
1181300	1184200	for perhaps what he's been training for his entire life,
1184200	1186000	a rampage in which all he does
1186000	1188900	is try to protect someone he sees as vulnerable.
1188900	1191100	Many characters offer Brad other options
1191100	1193300	or question why he personally
1193300	1195100	should be the one deciding how to raise
1195100	1198600	or deal with the existence of the only girl left in the world,
1198600	1201200	and he doesn't even really consider these questions
1201200	1203400	because for him, the answer was obvious.
1203400	1204900	He pushes past these questions
1204900	1207400	all the way to what a game would normally position
1207400	1209000	as a heroic final stand
1209000	1211700	where he finally starts to quite literally transform
1211700	1214500	into a monster and enters a haze of violence
1214500	1217600	where the background is just a chaotic swirl of colors
1217600	1220500	and even an army of enemies are horrified.
1220500	1222800	Brad is unable to pursue other courses of action
1222800	1225300	because of who his experiences have made him into.
1225300	1227000	The joy that he's become addicted to
1227000	1229600	is described as making you feel nothing.
1229600	1231400	It's very clear why something like that
1231400	1234000	would become a crutch for someone who's lived Brad's life.
1234000	1235500	By doing this, the story positions
1235500	1237200	a lot of traditional heroism tropes
1237200	1239300	as the result of a warped perspective.
1239300	1240700	One of the last lines in the game
1240700	1242700	before the final battle starts is,
1242700	1245900	"'I've been dead for 35 years. Today I live.'"
1245900	1247800	This is the first time in most of Brad's life
1247800	1249300	that the world makes sense,
1249300	1251900	him against what he sees as an army of villains
1251900	1253600	preventing him from being a father.
1253600	1255900	It's the only narrative that makes sense to him,
1255900	1257300	and the game encourages the player
1257300	1258700	to think about what went wrong
1258700	1260900	and why he can't think about it.
1260900	1262300	There are also places where the player
1262300	1263600	is offered a direct choice,
1263600	1265400	such as fighting or sparing his father
1265400	1267100	once he finally encounters him again,
1267100	1268700	which is itself a false one.
1268700	1271100	While you can choose to try to spare him,
1271100	1272900	Brad cannot resist himself.
1272900	1274500	This is an important creative choice,
1274500	1275900	or at least an honest one.
1275900	1277200	Everyone wants to believe
1277200	1278900	they're in full control of themselves,
1278900	1281200	but quite simply, sometimes we aren't.
1281200	1282800	Humans aren't rational actors.
1282800	1285200	Brad's been fighting manifestations of this man
1285200	1286900	all his life already.
1286900	1287900	What's one more?
1291900	1294900	The Painful is, fittingly,
1294900	1296600	a game about pain.
1296600	1298900	It's about the suffering we can experience in our lives
1298900	1301100	and how it can stick with us whether we want it to or not
1301100	1303800	and influence us in ways we don't always want to see
1303800	1305700	and in turn go on to make us hurt others
1305700	1307500	even when we think what we're doing is right,
1307500	1309700	and the hurt we cause impacts them too.
1309700	1311500	It doesn't always offer an easy solution.
1311500	1314900	There's no magical pill that undoes childhood trauma
1314900	1317100	or allows complete control of one's actions.
1317100	1320400	It puts out the scary idea that none of us are free
1320400	1323300	because we're prisoners of the events and lives we've lived,
1323300	1325800	but there's a certain hopefulness to it too.
1325800	1329000	For all his mistakes and inabilities to make better choices
1329000	1331200	and drug or trauma-induced violence
1331200	1333200	he can't stop himself from committing,
1333200	1335200	there are still real choices to make,
1335200	1337000	and these choices still have meaning.
1337000	1339500	There are places where Brad is marginally making things better
1339500	1342000	for some people or at least tries to,
1342000	1344200	and there are often times when you can literally choose
1344200	1347400	to lose pieces of yourself to try and keep others alive.
1347400	1351700	These little choices are meaningful and valuable.
1351700	1354800	The game rightfully acknowledges this by having multiple endings.
1354800	1356500	If you manage to outside of cutscenes
1356500	1359800	never take the combat-enhancing but addictive item Joy,
1359800	1362700	an item designed to be used in harder fights
1362700	1364800	that's quite difficult to go without using,
1364800	1367200	the ending is very slightly different,
1367200	1369300	and if you manage to finish the game in pain mode
1369300	1372300	where everything is tougher and save points can only be used once,
1372300	1374700	the ending is again just a little bit different.
1374700	1376200	I think the point of these endings
1376200	1379400	is that things can be different, even a little, if we try,
1379400	1380800	and that makes trying worthwhile
1380800	1383000	even if it doesn't always amount to something.
1383000	1385300	The point isn't that Brad is a good person
1385300	1387500	but that he has the potential to do better,
1387500	1388600	as everyone does,
1388600	1391500	and start asking the right questions about himself,
1391500	1393000	and this is a hopeful thing.
1393000	1395100	The final choice in the game is buddies,
1395100	1397300	whether or not to hug Brad and empathize with him
1397300	1398800	in spite of the pain he's caused her
1398800	1401400	and the life she will live as a result of this.
1401400	1402600	This is a difficult choice
1402600	1405400	and arguably an ultimately meaningless one.
1405400	1407200	Do you hug a dying man or not?
1407200	1409400	It doesn't matter, but it's a real choice
1409400	1411100	in a world of many false ones.
1411100	1412700	Brad wasn't a good person,
1412700	1414100	but he didn't have as much of a say
1414100	1415800	in what kind of person he ended up being
1415800	1416900	as he'd have liked,
1416900	1420300	and the idea that things could maybe have turned out better
1420300	1422600	and helped him make better choices
1422600	1424400	is the real hope of the story.
1424400	1426200	It's a hard-won victory to tell a story
1426200	1428000	in which nothing good happens to anyone
1428000	1430500	and the character you play isn't a good person,
1430500	1433300	but you're left feeling like people still have the potential
1433300	1434500	to do better.
1434500	1436000	This is something the final game,
1436000	1437100	Lisa the Joyful,
1437100	1439000	does its best to call back into question
1439000	1441000	with somewhat mixed results.
1452700	1454600	Lisa the Joyful's first segments
1454600	1456600	are an excellent microcosm of the positives
1456600	1458400	and negatives of its overall story.
1458400	1460100	It opens incredibly strongly
1460100	1462100	with a revelation about what Buddy was learning
1462100	1464600	during the upbringing we only saw in fleeting glimpses
1464600	1466400	during the opening of the previous game.
1466400	1468800	Buddy is forced by Brad to kill someone
1468800	1471200	in order to begin to learn how to defend herself.
1471200	1473600	This shows us how she was able to escape capture
1473600	1475000	so easily in the previous games
1475000	1477800	and lets us a little into how she'll have come to see the world
1477800	1479800	and, of course, showcases Brad's own views
1479800	1481700	about that world in detail, too.
1481700	1484100	I always wondered who killed this guy on the counter here,
1484100	1485900	and the answer is probably Buddy.
1486400	1488400	♪♪
1488400	1491200	♪♪
1491200	1493600	But then, after a cool cut to the title,
1493600	1494600	it cuts to black,
1494600	1497000	and we get some regular expository dialogue
1497000	1500000	about what two characters were yet to really learn about are up to,
1500000	1502500	implying various things about character relationships
1502500	1504700	and the reasons why the world is the way it is.
1504700	1507400	We then cut to immediately after the ending of the previous game
1507400	1509200	where things continue in Media Res.
1509200	1511200	These twin openings are an indicator
1511200	1513600	of the two roles the Joyful has to fill.
1513600	1516500	The Joyful was a stretch goal for the Kickstarter for the Painful,
1516500	1518700	the mission statement being that you'll play as Buddy
1518700	1521500	and uncover the truth behind the world of Lisa,
1521500	1524400	but it turns out those are very separate things entirely
1524400	1526900	and actually quite jarring when done together.
1526900	1529400	The world of Lisa is interesting and mysterious,
1529400	1531000	but part of what made it those things
1531000	1533000	was that you were exploring it as a byproduct
1533000	1534700	of a much more personal story
1534700	1537200	where the apocalypse was just a way of putting these characters
1537200	1539100	into more extreme circumstances.
1539100	1541900	Exploring it in more detail or explaining it outright
1541900	1544500	would have detracted from the engaging personal story,
1544500	1546000	taken time away from it,
1546000	1548400	and, well, it would have ruined the mystery.
1548400	1550400	You can carve a really sharp divide
1550400	1552800	between the parts that are about kinda just expositing
1552800	1554900	what happened in the past involving Lisa
1554900	1557600	or implying what happened to the world and who's behind it
1557600	1560600	and retroactively explaining the events of the previous game
1560600	1563100	and the parts that make up this really interesting story
1563100	1565400	about the last girl in a world full of monsters
1565400	1566900	trying to become its new ruler
1566900	1569600	by crossing every other warlord off a giant list
1569600	1572100	and becoming a little bit of a monster herself on the way.
1572100	1575100	The latter is really new and unique and interesting
1575100	1577800	while building on the themes and story we already know,
1577800	1580400	but the former is unnecessary and explains things
1580400	1581600	that don't need explaining
1581600	1583900	because they're not really what the story was about.
1583900	1585400	This doesn't just mean half the story
1585400	1586700	isn't as good as it could be.
1586700	1589100	It also drags focus away from Buddy's story
1589100	1590900	and weakens that half a little too.
1590900	1592300	It's not the worst thing in the world,
1592300	1594700	but I think more focus on Buddy and her choices
1594700	1596500	would have resulted in a much more engaging
1596500	1598200	and tighter story overall.
1598200	1600200	That said, the story that is there for Buddy
1600200	1601300	is honestly great.
1601300	1603600	Where Brad decided that for the safety of himself
1603600	1605600	and his loved ones, he had to close his problems off
1605600	1608000	from the world and hide from the people who threatened them,
1608000	1609900	hoping to keep them a secret forever,
1609900	1612000	Buddy learned the exact opposite lesson
1612000	1614000	and concluded that the only way to be safe
1614000	1616900	was to kill everyone who could possibly pose a threat
1616900	1618100	and take control.
1618100	1620700	She's literally crossing names off a list
1620700	1623500	and slowly imagining more and more violence around her
1623500	1624500	as she does so.
1624500	1627300	The fun thing about stories with parental dynamics like this,
1627300	1629600	similar to some chapters of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,
1629600	1631500	is through one character's behavior,
1631500	1634000	you simultaneously get to learn about that character
1634000	1636100	and the people who made them that way.
1636100	1638600	A good deal of Buddy's behavior reflects back onto Brad
1638600	1639800	and the lessons she'd have learned
1639800	1641200	either through his direct teachings
1641200	1643300	or through having to live with someone like him.
1643300	1646000	You're still learning about precisely what happened to Lisa
1646000	1649300	and what she did about it through how Brad and Buddy act,
1649300	1650600	and that's fascinating.
1650600	1652800	The massive cast of party members from the Painful
1652800	1654000	is not a feature here.
1654000	1656200	You just get Buddy and temporarily Rando
1656200	1658100	while Buddy levels up and the player gets the hang
1658100	1659500	of her new gameplay style.
1659500	1660900	While I said having lots of characters
1660900	1663600	that you could choose from and risk losing was cool,
1663600	1666100	having less characters isn't specifically a bad thing.
1666100	1668100	Instead, the focus is on having one character
1668100	1669800	whose moves are more mechanically dense
1669800	1672200	than any individual character previously,
1672200	1675100	giving her both the ability to induce numerous status effects
1675100	1677300	like Flustered, Sleep, Bleed, and Poison
1677300	1679500	and a slew of generally good attacks, too.
1679500	1681700	Buddy's stronger attacks have a timing minigame
1681700	1683000	which can be quite tough to master
1683000	1685300	but are highly necessary for persevering.
1685400	1688300	Joy makes a return and the game's hallucinatory tutorials
1688300	1691600	from Buddy's psyche even quite strongly advise you to use it.
1691600	1694400	Apparently, the use joy messages were added in a patch
1694400	1696400	when players had trouble proceeding without it,
1696400	1698900	committed to not using joy the way many did in the Painful
1698900	1700100	because they knew there was an ending
1700100	1701700	specifically for not using it.
1701700	1703100	There is no such ending here,
1703100	1705400	meaning the joy mechanic can be properly used
1705400	1707600	by folks who skipped out on it before like me.
1707600	1709500	The story isn't the only thing that's divided.
1709500	1712700	The gameplay and story suffer from a much sharper divide, too.
1712700	1715400	Where the previous game had the almost magical interaction
1715400	1718100	between story choices and their gameplay consequences,
1718100	1720200	no such choices pop up for Buddy.
1720200	1721700	There are a couple of moments where you're given
1721700	1724100	the sort of typical moral choice of little consequence
1724100	1725700	you would see in inferior RPGs
1725700	1728100	like deciding whether or not to drop Rando into the pit
1728100	1730400	or whether or not to attack the pacifists.
1730400	1731800	It's a bit disappointing.
1731800	1733000	Worse, with the Rando choice,
1733000	1734600	it doesn't matter which choice you make.
1734600	1736500	It results in slightly different exposition
1736500	1738100	and maybe lets you skip a fight,
1738100	1740000	but the same things play out no matter what
1740000	1742400	with no further impact on story or gameplay.
1742400	1744700	But with the pacifists, there's this chilling aspect
1744700	1746100	showing how far Buddy has gone
1746100	1747700	where you can't even talk to them
1747700	1750100	and attempting to or even walking past them
1750100	1752700	asks you once again if you want to fight them or not.
1752700	1756400	Every few steps, Buddy has to actively choose not to murder,
1756400	1758100	which, of course, is the highlighted option
1758100	1759800	like it's her first instinct.
1759800	1762000	You're never given any really difficult choices.
1762000	1764200	You never have to risk losing any useful items.
1764200	1766400	In fact, there aren't really any of the rarer items
1766400	1768400	from the painful that would relieve harmful effects
1768400	1770700	in a pinch like the poison-curing cigarettes
1770700	1772500	you find, like, six of in the whole game
1772500	1774000	because lots of the tougher effects
1774000	1775900	have been taken out entirely to support a game
1775900	1777700	with largely only one character.
1777700	1780000	There's basically no point to the shopkeeper at all
1780000	1781200	and the main path through the game
1781200	1782800	gives you an abundance of joy,
1782800	1784800	so item management is basically gone
1784800	1787000	and all the party member reviving perfume you get
1787000	1789300	only matters for a very short period anyway
1789300	1790800	because you're on your own.
1790800	1792000	This ruins what could have been
1792000	1794300	a much more delicate balance of items.
1794300	1796100	Honestly, my expectations for the joyful
1796100	1797900	in the first hour were super high.
1797900	1799400	I was imagining all the different ways
1799500	1800900	a version of this battle system
1800900	1802500	but mechanically based around having
1802500	1804100	just one character could work.
1804100	1805700	Status effects, item management,
1805700	1807600	TP management, learning the timing
1807600	1809600	of the better attacks, making the best use
1809600	1811700	of your one turn per round in a fight
1811700	1814300	could become scalpel-sharp concentrations
1814300	1817200	of important choices and a robust inventory system
1817200	1819000	where defense and armor have to be balanced
1819000	1820700	against resistance or speed
1820700	1823600	or trying not to get stunned or tripped or poisoned.
1823600	1824900	This could have made for a really
1824900	1826500	mechanically dense game.
1826500	1828600	I was fully prepared to say that the joyful
1828600	1830600	had the best gameplay of the three games,
1830600	1833900	and while this theoretical version of Lisa
1833900	1835900	does almost rear its head in a few
1835900	1837700	of the tougher fights against larger groups
1837700	1839800	or if you commit to not taking Joy,
1839800	1842100	it never really feels like you're being challenged
1842100	1843900	in any way other than nailing the timing
1843900	1845500	on Buddy's more damaging attacks.
1845500	1847100	I think the gameplay is still overall
1847100	1848700	very fun and really challenging,
1848700	1850500	but the awareness of how much better
1850500	1852000	this approach could have been
1852000	1854300	makes it feel like a missed opportunity at times.
1854300	1856500	One of the best and sadly only examples
1856500	1858000	of gameplay and story overlapping
1858000	1860100	is that your other party member Rando's attacks
1860100	1861800	are also called Armstrong-style
1861800	1863600	because Brad trained him as a kid.
1863600	1864800	That's just really cute.
1864800	1866600	The soundtrack, in addition to containing
1866600	1869300	even more heavily distorted and speed-shifted versions
1869300	1871400	of previous tracks, has a bunch of new ones
1871400	1873000	with an increased reliance on samples
1873000	1875700	including new instruments, vocals, and even air horns.
1875700	1877800	I remember putting a playlist of Lisa music
1877800	1880000	on at a friend's house, and once it transitioned
1880000	1882800	into tracks from the joyful, he made me stop.
1882800	1884000	I really like the music,
1884000	1885700	not just because I have horrible taste,
1885700	1888500	but because its use in the game is perfect.
1888500	1890200	Tracks like the almost abominable
1890200	1893500	666 Kill Chop Deluxe play during tougher boss fights,
1893500	1895500	and it's not just fitting but complementary
1895500	1898700	to the sense of being trapped in the hellish storm
1898700	1901500	of drug-infused violence Buddy has become.
1901500	1904300	This soundtrack is the most complementary to a game
1904300	1907000	since Fallout New Vegas or even Planescape Torment.
1907000	1909400	There's something to be said about the engagement
1909400	1910700	I felt with the joyful.
1910700	1912100	In Painful, my first time through,
1912100	1914200	I was almost afraid to open it back up again
1914200	1916400	and see how much worse things could get for Brad,
1916400	1918200	find out who in my party I'd become attached to
1918200	1919800	I'd lose trying to find Buddy.
1919800	1921600	Joyful, fittingly for its title,
1921600	1923800	makes you feel like you have nothing to lose.
1923800	1925300	I took a break partway through Joyful
1925300	1927400	and couldn't wait to open it back up and finish it
1927400	1929300	and continue crossing names off the list.
1929300	1930900	There's something incredibly appealing
1930900	1933000	about Buddy's journey in spite of everything negative
1933000	1934200	I've said about the story.
1934200	1936000	Spoilers for the plot in case you somehow made it
1936000	1937200	this far without playing.
1937200	1939300	Eventually, Buddy kills everyone on the list,
1939300	1941000	but then because the ending needs to explain
1941000	1942300	the universe of Lisa,
1942400	1944500	what follows is almost completely unrelated.
1944500	1946900	Buddy suddenly meets the man who's behind everything.
1946900	1949200	We get some exposition, a fairly easy fight,
1949200	1951600	a few genuinely fantastic character-exploring
1951600	1953300	hallucinations for a bit in the middle.
1953300	1955800	Bozo explains the plot you and Buddy
1955800	1957400	didn't really need to know about,
1957400	1960200	and then Buddy gets to choose whether to mutate like Brad
1960200	1962400	or cure herself using the Joy vaccine
1962400	1963600	we just learned about
1963600	1965900	and raise the next generation of humankind.
1965900	1968400	This ending really kind of disappointed me.
1968400	1971500	Like, mutating into a monster has so far been a metaphor
1971500	1973800	for being taken over by your worst instincts.
1973800	1975800	The transformation is fueled by joy,
1975800	1977900	but wanting joy is fueled by having something
1977900	1980600	eating you up inside until the joy ate you up
1980600	1982300	and turned you into a monstrous expression
1982300	1983700	of those feelings, for example,
1983700	1986400	turning Brad into a monster obsessed with protecting Lisa
1986400	1987900	and Buddy by proxy.
1987900	1989800	I wrote the part of the script covering the painful
1989800	1992400	a year ago before I finally decided to play Joyful,
1992400	1993800	and what I liked about the problems
1993800	1995500	that appeared in that game is that they're not something
1995500	1997400	you can choose to walk away from.
1997400	1999000	You take those parts of you everywhere,
1999000	2001000	and you can't just erase them from yourself.
2001000	2003600	I literally wrote that there is no magic cure,
2003600	2006000	so having the game end with Buddy able to quickly
2006000	2008500	and easily choose to get over the traumatic life
2008500	2010200	that led her to be the person she is
2010200	2012200	instead of having to learn to deal with it
2012200	2014100	in the sort of personal human way
2014100	2016000	I'd come to expect from the series
2016000	2017600	was really jarring to me.
2017600	2019800	The skeleton of a really good story is still here,
2019800	2022100	but it's obscured by having to be all the other things
2022100	2023200	that it had to be,
2023200	2024800	and this really deprives us of the chance
2024800	2026800	to really explore Buddy and her choices
2026800	2029800	and how she would even go about moving on from all this,
2029800	2031500	but at the same time, I'm really touched
2031500	2034400	that this series about sadness and tragedy and decline
2034400	2036700	ends with a victim of abuse achieving what amounts
2036700	2039500	to some sense of closure or even a happy ending
2039500	2042000	and, earned or not, getting to put aside
2042000	2044000	their sadness and depression and self-loathing
2044000	2046400	and escape into the possibilities of the future.
2046400	2048700	I think it could have been done a lot better,
2048700	2051200	but I really, really like what it did.
2051200	2053400	In a way, playing this game as someone
2053400	2054800	who thinks a lot about design
2054800	2057300	and occasionally tries to make games of their own,
2057300	2059500	there's something inspirational about it,
2059500	2061700	like, the theoretical really good game
2061700	2063800	I wanted it to be doesn't exist now,
2063800	2066600	which means someone else gets to make that one.
2066600	2068600	That someone else could even be you,
2068600	2070700	and I think the truly fascinating power
2070700	2073100	about really good games is they leave people
2073100	2075600	with ideas about what they could do next.
2075600	2078000	They spread the ideas and concepts further
2078000	2079900	by being so good even if sometimes
2079900	2080900	they leave you wanting
2080900	2083200	or perhaps even by leaving you wanting.
2083200	2086700	Lisa owes a debt of sorts to both Yume Nikki and EarthBound,
2086700	2088700	which, of course, has inspired lots of other games,
2088700	2089900	including Undertale,
2089900	2092000	itself made by someone who also started out
2092000	2094300	making what amounts to an EarthBound fangame.
2094300	2096600	Some games are just excellent at spawning
2096600	2098100	this desire to add to them,
2098100	2100900	to create something using the ideas it leaves with you,
2100900	2104200	and, fantastically, Lisa is doing just that.
2104200	2107400	There's already at least two really fleshed-out Lisa fangames,
2107400	2109400	Lisa the Hopeful and Lisa the Pointless,
2109400	2111700	and who knows what great designers in the future
2111700	2114500	might say Lisa was the inspiration for their own projects.
2114500	2116800	In my opinion, Lisa is already doomed
2116800	2118600	to enter the stream of history.
2118600	2120600	I guarantee you 100%,
2120600	2122900	one of the future best games ever made,
2122900	2125000	one of the next indie mega-hits on Steam
2125000	2127500	or whatever platform will make it into the next decade
2127500	2131800	will be made by someone upon whom this game has left its mark.
2131800	2133100	It's kind of funny.
2133100	2135200	The games are all about trying to get over something,
2135200	2137300	move on from it, forget about it,
2137300	2139600	but we're going to see Lisa again one day
2139600	2142000	in a new form we might not even recognize,
2142000	2144500	and, personally, I can't wait.

2151700	2154000	Hey, congratulations for making it to the end.
2154000	2156000	This thing has been a really long time coming,
2156000	2158300	and I know I didn't make many jokes this time,
2158300	2161100	but I wanted to do the ideas the game presents justice.
2161100	2162900	Please let me know what you thought of this one in the comments.
2162900	2165600	I'm genuinely quite interested in how this will be received.
2165600	2167300	I'd quite like to cover Night in the Woods
2167300	2168900	with quite a similar format to this one,
2168900	2171200	but I'd like to know what people thought of this one first.
