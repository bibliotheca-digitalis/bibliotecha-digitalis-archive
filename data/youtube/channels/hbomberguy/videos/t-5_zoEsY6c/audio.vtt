00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
Austin Jorgensen's series Lisa is one of those cult hits,

00:05.700 --> 00:09.900
the kind where it's quite genuinely formed a cult of people who are really into it,

00:09.900 --> 00:13.600
but not many people outside the in-group really know that much about it.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.100
This is probably because it's hard to talk about.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.900
It's got a lot of really funny moments,

00:17.900 --> 00:21.900
some excellent examples of great writing or perfect comedic timing,

00:21.900 --> 00:23.700
but unlike, for example, Undertale,

00:23.700 --> 00:27.800
the story's content has some pretty gruesome and uncomfortable material.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.400
It enters into an artistic territory where you'd need to know someone pretty well

00:31.400 --> 00:33.200
to feel okay recommending it to them.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.000
It explores themes that can be quite difficult to talk about

00:36.000 --> 00:38.700
and which plenty of people quite justifiably don't want to,

00:38.700 --> 00:42.100
and the game is too good at focusing on what it wants to be about

00:42.100 --> 00:44.900
that you can't ignore it and just focus on something else.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.500
There's a process in modern game discourse I like to call memification.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.300
To be a little bit cynical, if you wanted to for easy clicks,

00:52.300 --> 00:55.300
there are some games you can invent reasons to talk about if you need to.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.900
The game's story and themes are loose and friendly and open enough

00:58.900 --> 01:01.500
that you can reapply the critical lens over and over

01:01.500 --> 01:05.300
and always have a new, somewhat facile element to explore for an audience.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.700
You can speculate for all time about some games

01:07.700 --> 01:10.100
if they have certain features that make it easy to do so.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.800
You could even do a needlessly in-depth analysis

01:12.800 --> 01:16.500
of one character's relationship with anime.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.100
No way, that one was mine, wasn't it?

01:18.100 --> 01:20.200
But when someone like that attempts to play Lisa,

01:20.200 --> 01:25.100
a game whose themes are unavoidable and specific and beautiful and horrific and sad,

01:25.100 --> 01:26.900
the best one could say is,

01:26.900 --> 01:28.800
this reminds me of Undertale.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.600
The only way to relate the experience through such a critically dysfunctional perspective

01:32.600 --> 01:36.700
is by using the lens of one of the two or three games you can talk about endlessly

01:36.700 --> 01:39.500
before going back to talking about them endlessly.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.900
Also, um, Lisa came out quite a bit before Undertale.

01:42.900 --> 01:43.700
Just saying, man.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.600
This is not a criticism of Undertale or the pretend-to-think-about-games economy,

01:47.600 --> 01:50.000
although I guess on some level it kind of is both of those.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.100
Rather, I'm laboring to point out that Lisa doesn't get talked about too much

01:53.100 --> 01:57.500
because by its nature, the reasons why it's good can be hard to talk about.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.700
With that in mind, I'm going to talk about it here

01:59.700 --> 02:02.600
and spoil aspects of the plots of all three of the games

02:02.600 --> 02:05.800
while not specifically summarizing them in explicit detail.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.700
I would highly recommend pausing the video here and playing the games for yourself.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.500
They're all either cheap or free,

02:11.500 --> 02:13.100
so there isn't much of an excuse not to,

02:13.100 --> 02:16.000
and I don't want to preemptively ruin your experience.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.400
See you in, I don't know, 20 hours?

02:18.400 --> 02:21.900
♪♪

02:21.900 --> 02:25.800
Most people probably at least vaguely know of Yume Nikki or Dream Diary,

02:25.800 --> 02:28.400
a free game made in an early version of RPG Maker

02:28.400 --> 02:31.800
in which you control a girl named Madotsuki who refuses to leave her room.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.400
Instead, she can go to bed and enter her dreams.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.100
The game is light on plot,

02:36.100 --> 02:40.700
instead relying on exploration and curiosity about the dream worlds you visit and how they work.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.000
You can collect items which have some uses,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.100
but I wouldn't really say the game has puzzles, per se.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.500
It functions more as a dream itself, floating from area to area

02:49.500 --> 02:52.700
as interesting and sometimes random events happen at you.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.500
The game's well-known largely because of some of these events,

02:55.500 --> 02:58.700
like when hitting a light switch sometimes makes this face appear.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.400
♪♪

03:01.400 --> 03:04.800
This face probably made Yume Nikki popular,

03:04.800 --> 03:07.500
and this has a 1 in 64 chance of even happening.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
I, uh, actually had to steal this footage.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.200
While the game doesn't really have a plot,

03:11.200 --> 03:15.400
it has buckets of story if you feel like interpreting the ideas it throws at you.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.600
Consistent imagery of car crash victims,

03:17.600 --> 03:20.900
grasping hands, staring eyes, being chased,

03:20.900 --> 03:24.100
the sudden outbursts of quite scary visuals and music.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.000
The reasons Madotsuki doesn't want to go out into the world for real

03:27.000 --> 03:29.400
are made astonishingly clear in her dreams.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.800
The game is, really, an exploration of one character's psyche

03:32.800 --> 03:35.700
and what they think about in their most unguarded moments.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.100
People think they can escape into their dreams,

03:38.100 --> 03:40.100
but you bring your mind with you,

03:40.100 --> 03:43.700
and if the thing you're trying to escape from had such a big impact on you,

03:43.700 --> 03:45.400
you're not getting away so easily.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.600
While the game is often praised for being weird or random,

03:48.600 --> 03:51.200
Yume Nikki has a good deal of clarity of purpose

03:51.200 --> 03:52.600
and probably resonates with people

03:52.600 --> 03:56.300
because the experiences and ideas it explores are almost universal.

03:56.300 --> 04:00.400
Almost everyone knows something bad could happen to them if they went outside,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.700
so playing to the paranoia that can come from that

04:02.700 --> 04:04.900
reaches a lot of people in parts of themselves

04:04.900 --> 04:06.400
they don't often realize are there.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.500
Yume Nikki was pretty impactful for a free RPG Maker game.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.400
There's several fan games and even more original but overtly inspired works,

04:13.400 --> 04:16.400
and one of them is Lisa, now called Lisa the First.

04:22.400 --> 04:26.900
Lisa is a story about a girl trapped in an abusive home trying to imagine her escape,

04:26.900 --> 04:30.500
but even in her own imagination, her experiences follow her everywhere.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.600
The similarities are already clear, but the differences are interesting.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.600
Trying to find an escape does involve collecting and using various items to progress,

04:37.600 --> 04:40.000
which is a little more direct than how Yume Nikki does it,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.200
but the themes are also much more direct,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.100
making them somewhat more impactful.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.300
Almost every character is portrayed by Lisa's abusive father,

04:47.300 --> 04:51.000
and trying to play to the bizarre whims of this rather singular cast

04:51.000 --> 04:53.500
is in its own way kind of depressing and scary.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.800
I'd recommend people play as much of the game as they can

04:55.800 --> 04:57.900
until they find a puzzle they don't know how to solve

04:57.900 --> 05:00.900
or get sick of dying to the spiders with the father's face on them

05:00.900 --> 05:03.800
and then watch a playthrough of someone who knows what they're doing on YouTube.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.500
It doesn't really hold up as a game,

05:05.500 --> 05:09.000
but as a story, as an exploration of a mind, as an atmosphere,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.200
it's emotionally quite an experience.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.900
An idea that starts here and prevails throughout the series

05:13.900 --> 05:17.400
and is one of its best features is the reuse of music from previous areas,

05:17.400 --> 05:18.600
but at different speeds.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.400
These stories put you in the mind of characters

05:29.400 --> 05:31.800
whose psyche is damaged by their experiences,

05:31.800 --> 05:35.200
and having even the music second-guess your memory of how it sounds

05:35.200 --> 05:36.700
is really disconcerting.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.100
It's cool getting the opportunity to see a work

05:39.100 --> 05:41.200
very openly inspired by something else,

05:41.200 --> 05:43.900
but also full of elements unique to itself.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.400
Or should I say you-may-neek to itself?

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
What am I talking about?

05:47.400 --> 05:50.600
The ending terminates disturbingly with this game over screen,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.100
and this is actually the last we ever physically see of Lisa

05:53.100 --> 05:55.100
in a series named for her,

05:55.100 --> 05:57.000
though characters have visions of her everywhere

05:57.000 --> 05:59.400
and her presence looms large in the rest of the story.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.300
♪

06:13.300 --> 06:16.400
Lisa, the Painful, also made in a version of RPG Maker,

06:16.400 --> 06:18.800
has a very different approach entirely to storytelling

06:18.800 --> 06:20.700
and more traditional RPG elements,

06:20.700 --> 06:23.500
and what's surprising about it is that this doesn't distract

06:23.500 --> 06:25.500
from giving the player an emotional through-line.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.300
RPGs have a tendency to sharply divide their gameplay and story.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.300
You level your characters and gather equipment and items and fight

06:32.300 --> 06:35.300
and then reach the next story beat in the form of a cutscene.

06:35.300 --> 06:39.000
Quite often you see fans of the expansive scope and story of RPGs,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.800
but who aren't hugely into the parts where they have to battle monsters

06:41.800 --> 06:43.600
or level grind between those bits,

06:43.600 --> 06:46.100
or the opposite where they might even skip the story

06:46.100 --> 06:48.000
to get to the part that engages them better,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.300
the actual gameplay.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.200
If you like both, you kind of have to like them separately

06:52.200 --> 06:53.700
on different levels from one another

06:53.700 --> 06:56.700
because they're ultimately very disparate aspects of the game.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.600
The Painful's greatest quality is that it does everything it can

06:59.600 --> 07:01.600
to be a synthesis of both of these elements,

07:01.600 --> 07:03.700
making them complement each other so directly

07:03.700 --> 07:06.100
that you can no longer really delineate them at all.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.300
All the most involving story moments

07:08.300 --> 07:10.700
also have direct importance on gameplay.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.800
Losing all your characters or a party member

07:12.800 --> 07:14.300
or having to play Russian roulette

07:14.300 --> 07:15.900
and risk literally losing characters

07:15.900 --> 07:18.900
to random chance to continue can be devastating

07:18.900 --> 07:20.600
in the same way that in several battles

07:20.600 --> 07:22.900
it's possible for a character to straight-up get killed

07:22.900 --> 07:23.900
instead of KO'd.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.800
♪

07:27.800 --> 07:30.200
♪

07:30.200 --> 07:33.300
By inflicting all the deaths and loss of the story

07:33.300 --> 07:34.600
on the player mechanically,

07:34.600 --> 07:37.200
by genuinely taking away everything they'd found

07:37.200 --> 07:38.500
or characters they play with,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
they're forcing the player to experience

07:40.500 --> 07:43.100
the story aspects of the game on a direct level.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.400
When something bad happens,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.600
it's not just bad because you theoretically care

07:46.600 --> 07:47.700
about these characters.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.200
It's bad because you need those people

07:50.200 --> 07:51.900
and you want those things.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.600
Stop taking my things!

07:53.600 --> 07:56.100
Speaking of things, those things are important.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.400
Take, for example, firebombs.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.500
They do a ton of damage

07:58.500 --> 08:00.400
and inflict the fire effect on your enemies

08:00.400 --> 08:02.300
and are very useful in boss battles

08:02.300 --> 08:04.500
or with bigger fights against larger groups

08:04.500 --> 08:06.900
or if you've already lost a lot of party members.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.000
You might actually genuinely need the items you can find

08:10.000 --> 08:11.400
as opposed to a lot of RPGs

08:11.400 --> 08:13.200
where most of the stuff feels optional

08:13.200 --> 08:15.400
or just, like, another potion or something.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.200
This causes the player to invest more

08:17.200 --> 08:18.700
in trying to find these things

08:18.700 --> 08:20.200
which makes the game more engaging

08:20.200 --> 08:22.700
and very effectively puts you into the role

08:22.700 --> 08:24.900
of someone scavenging a broken wasteland

08:24.900 --> 08:26.300
for anything of value.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.900
I made a video last year exploring ludonarrative,

08:28.900 --> 08:31.100
the idea that while games can have stories,

08:31.100 --> 08:33.400
the actual story was the player's experience

08:33.400 --> 08:35.300
of the game itself through its mechanics

08:35.300 --> 08:38.500
and really engaging games forge an emotional perspective

08:38.500 --> 08:39.600
for the player to occupy

08:39.600 --> 08:41.500
through good execution of those mechanics

08:41.500 --> 08:45.100
and Lisa might be the best game I've ever seen at this.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.600
It's one of few games where I've had a bad outcome,

08:47.600 --> 08:49.400
lost someone permanently in a hard fight

08:49.400 --> 08:50.900
a long way off from my last save

08:50.900 --> 08:53.700
or almost all of my party to Russian roulette

08:53.700 --> 08:55.900
and continued because I'd come so far

08:55.900 --> 08:57.600
and didn't want to have to go all the way back

08:57.600 --> 09:00.400
or worse off, had no idea how much worse it would be

09:00.400 --> 09:01.600
if I tried again.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.000
I save scum like a madman in games when I can,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.800
like I have a folder on my hard drive

09:05.800 --> 09:08.800
full of Darkest Dungeon and XCOM saves just in case

09:08.800 --> 09:11.800
but Lisa makes pressing on despite what comes by you

09:11.800 --> 09:13.300
feel like the right thing to do

09:13.300 --> 09:16.000
and always makes it inconvenient enough

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
that the alternative, loading a save,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.700
feels like a punishment itself that you want to avoid.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.700
You have to press on because the last save point

09:22.700 --> 09:23.800
was way back there

09:23.800 --> 09:26.500
and who knows how many people you'll lose next time.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.200
There are several points where the player is told

09:28.200 --> 09:30.600
to make a choice between losing everything they have

09:30.600 --> 09:32.900
or a person's life or one of Brad's arms.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.600
These choices aren't reversible and can't be worked around.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.800
Losing one or both arms permanently alters

09:37.800 --> 09:40.200
the mechanics and abilities of the one party member

09:40.200 --> 09:41.400
you'll always have,

09:41.400 --> 09:43.000
losing a party member whose abilities

09:43.000 --> 09:44.800
you probably need to survive,

09:44.800 --> 09:47.000
losing all the firebombs and equipment

09:47.000 --> 09:48.300
keeping you alive.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.100
These are all choices that are difficult

09:50.100 --> 09:52.900
and each genuinely make the game harder.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.400
You actually want, because of the game's mechanics,

09:55.400 --> 09:57.200
to keep all of these people

09:57.200 --> 09:59.700
because they're relevant not to the game's story

09:59.700 --> 10:02.200
but to your ability to get through the game

10:02.200 --> 10:04.200
and this means being forced to choose

10:04.200 --> 10:07.500
is more painful than most other decisions in video games.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.300
If these characters were just other characters

10:09.300 --> 10:11.000
in the story that was also happening

10:11.000 --> 10:13.800
while I was playing an unrelated RPG in fights,

10:13.800 --> 10:15.100
this wouldn't have mattered at all,

10:15.100 --> 10:17.200
but when someone threatens Terry,

10:17.200 --> 10:19.700
your best friend, more on Terry later,

10:19.700 --> 10:21.500
that means something.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.900
These characters have mechanical value to the player

10:23.900 --> 10:26.500
who might well have come to rely on them in fights.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.700
Fascinatingly, most of the characters in your party

10:28.700 --> 10:31.400
in Lisa don't matter to the main story whatsoever,

10:31.400 --> 10:33.400
but I cared more about their survival

10:33.400 --> 10:35.500
because they were important to me.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.500
Having to choose to go without items to keep them

10:37.500 --> 10:39.300
or learn to press on without them

10:39.300 --> 10:41.200
because losing all your healing items

10:41.200 --> 10:43.500
and money and firebombs just isn't manageable

10:43.500 --> 10:46.100
is a real choice that you have to account for.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.900
I can imagine having characters or items taken away

10:48.900 --> 10:50.700
being frustrating for some players,

10:50.700 --> 10:53.400
but it's absolutely fitting to this one story

10:53.400 --> 10:56.700
and I do think that frustration is itself compelling.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.100
The same way that having to send Simpsons hentai

10:59.100 --> 11:01.000
to the brothel to keep them from losing their mind

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
completely was in Darkest Dungeon.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.800
There's also a lot of random events

11:04.800 --> 11:07.000
that trigger when you sleep to recover your health,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.900
events like losing party members

11:08.900 --> 11:10.000
and having to get them back

11:10.000 --> 11:11.800
or everyone getting badly poisoned

11:11.800 --> 11:13.200
or just stuff getting stolen.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.800
These sorts of things create a quite genuine paranoia

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
in the player because, again, you want all that stuff.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.800
You learn to only take the risk when you really need to,

11:21.800 --> 11:24.300
and this paranoia puts you into the same sort of mindset

11:24.400 --> 11:26.800
as Brad who sees Lisa everywhere,

11:26.800 --> 11:28.400
looking down and judging him.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.200
This, again, builds on a mechanic from Yume Nikki.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.800
Random events happened in that game,

11:32.800 --> 11:35.700
but they didn't affect the gameplay all that much

11:35.700 --> 11:37.600
and they didn't even really affect the story

11:37.600 --> 11:39.200
unless you're a pretentious weirdo

11:39.200 --> 11:40.700
who likes to read into things.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.200
Lisa builds a universe where you can randomly lose

11:43.200 --> 11:46.500
someone important to you and that's scary and threatening

11:46.500 --> 11:49.000
and makes you afraid to go to sleep in the game,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.300
and while that's not technically a fair mechanic,

11:51.300 --> 11:53.500
it's a powerful mechanic

11:53.500 --> 11:55.300
and that's actually more important

11:55.300 --> 11:57.200
than the game being balanced or fair.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.000
The gameplay and story exist to get across the same ideas

12:00.000 --> 12:01.500
and do it by affecting each other

12:01.500 --> 12:03.900
in much more direct ways than most RPGs.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.300
There's even a section where,

12:05.300 --> 12:07.200
upon being told to choose between losing

12:07.200 --> 12:09.700
what will probably be at that point your second arm

12:09.700 --> 12:11.600
or losing all your items,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
you have the third option of asking the character

12:13.600 --> 12:15.100
why they're doing this to you,

12:15.100 --> 12:17.300
and while you're briefly offered the chance

12:17.300 --> 12:19.000
of seeing past this facade,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.800
he then takes both your arm and all your items

12:21.800 --> 12:24.100
as a seemingly purposeful attack on games

12:24.100 --> 12:25.300
that offer easy ways out,

12:25.300 --> 12:27.400
where you can sweet-talk your way past a choice

12:27.400 --> 12:28.500
that it should have been hard.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.100
The player is punished for believing

12:30.100 --> 12:31.400
it would be so simple.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.000
While it would have been easy to load a save here,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
the first time through the game,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.100
it felt so right for this to have happened,

12:37.100 --> 12:40.200
to be punished for trying to avoid making a hard decision,

12:40.200 --> 12:42.200
that I pressed on to the end regardless.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.500
The game's use of tons of different status effects

12:44.500 --> 12:45.800
with their own particular challenges

12:45.800 --> 12:47.700
is also really fun, by the way.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.100
They can be devastating,

12:49.100 --> 12:51.000
meaning the player has to work to deal with them

12:51.000 --> 12:52.400
instead of trying to muscle through it

12:52.400 --> 12:53.900
by being higher leveled

12:53.900 --> 12:55.700
or dealing as much damage as they can

12:55.700 --> 12:56.700
and hoping that's enough,

12:56.700 --> 12:58.700
so fights become engaging questions

12:58.700 --> 13:00.100
that demand an answer.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.900
Do I do the most highly damaging attack,

13:01.900 --> 13:04.400
or do I try and stun them or knock them down?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.500
I played a lot of RPGs when I was a stupid kid

13:06.500 --> 13:08.300
or still more as a stupid adult

13:08.300 --> 13:11.400
without ever really bothering to deal with status effects,

13:11.400 --> 13:13.100
using attacks that dealt the most damage

13:13.100 --> 13:15.500
and maybe using health items or phoenix downs,

13:15.500 --> 13:17.300
interacting less with the mechanics

13:17.300 --> 13:19.000
and having less fun because the game

13:19.000 --> 13:21.100
hadn't really made me, conditioning me

13:21.100 --> 13:23.300
to play it in a less fun or interesting way.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.700
Being made to plan around enemies

13:25.700 --> 13:27.300
which deal interesting status effects

13:27.300 --> 13:29.400
and learning to have to use your own effectively

13:29.400 --> 13:30.800
because otherwise you'll die

13:30.800 --> 13:33.300
makes this basically the best RPG experience

13:33.300 --> 13:34.600
I've ever actually had.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.700
The game teaches you the importance of statuses

13:36.700 --> 13:38.200
in a really straightforward way.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.000
Your first party member, Terry Hintz,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.700
is so poor at fighting that it's played for a joke.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.100
This means one of the two moves you get every turn

13:45.100 --> 13:48.100
at the start of the game is free to be wholly concerned

13:48.100 --> 13:50.700
with using items and abilities that involve healing,

13:50.700 --> 13:53.300
restoring TP and SP, or verbal bash

13:53.300 --> 13:56.000
which can make enemies start crying and deal 50% damage

13:56.000 --> 13:58.900
or get pissed and become far less likely to hit people

13:58.900 --> 14:01.700
but also much more likely to hit for critical damage.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.000
Oh, and sometimes they can also hit themselves

14:04.000 --> 14:05.300
for massive damage too.

14:05.300 --> 14:08.100
Terry Hintz might be genuinely one of the best pieces

14:08.100 --> 14:10.100
of game design in the last 10 years.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.800
Instead of, as in lots of RPGs,

14:11.800 --> 14:13.300
handing you decent damage dealers

14:13.300 --> 14:15.600
and then making the player only consider status effects

14:15.600 --> 14:17.500
and healing when it's absolutely necessary

14:17.500 --> 14:20.100
or when a designated healer class comes along,

14:20.100 --> 14:22.000
the second half of your starting party

14:22.000 --> 14:23.900
is functionally unable to hurt anyone

14:23.900 --> 14:26.000
so you're handed an opportunity to figure out

14:26.000 --> 14:28.200
how to make effective use of status effects

14:28.200 --> 14:29.800
and items as early on as possible

14:29.800 --> 14:31.700
and because of the game's difficulty,

14:31.700 --> 14:33.500
if you don't, you're basically screwed

14:33.500 --> 14:35.600
so you're forced to learn how to play

14:35.600 --> 14:38.000
but in a subtle and suggestive way.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.900
You can see that sort of consideration happening

14:39.900 --> 14:41.600
in other aspects of design too.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.500
One of the first key items to continue,

14:43.500 --> 14:46.100
a child's bicycle because this game's great,

14:46.200 --> 14:47.600
is only accessible through an enemy

14:47.600 --> 14:48.800
that you'll need a full party

14:48.800 --> 14:50.700
and a couple of firebombs to defeat.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.300
Beating the boss means teaching you

14:52.300 --> 14:53.800
the value of these items,

14:53.800 --> 14:54.900
which makes scrounging for them

14:54.900 --> 14:56.600
and holding onto them feel worth it

14:56.600 --> 14:58.100
and deciding to use one in a fight

14:58.100 --> 14:59.500
becomes a calculated risk

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
because you might have needed that later.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.200
It makes managing to find some hidden

15:03.200 --> 15:04.900
in the wild feel incredible

15:04.900 --> 15:07.200
and, yes, it makes being forced to choose

15:07.200 --> 15:09.400
between losing an arm and all of your things

15:09.400 --> 15:11.600
into a genuinely nail-biting decision

15:11.600 --> 15:13.600
because they're so goddamn useful.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.300
I don't think I've ever felt so attached

15:15.300 --> 15:17.600
to an expendable resource in a video game before.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.100
This is, quite simply, genius.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.700
And then when you do get the bike,

15:21.700 --> 15:23.400
you'll notice that you can't move left with it

15:23.400 --> 15:24.800
and drop off because your way is blocked

15:24.800 --> 15:28.500
by this, uh, sports...board on a stick.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.200
♪

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
You have to move right again.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.100
Now, you probably already equipped it

15:34.100 --> 15:35.100
because it's a new item,

15:35.100 --> 15:36.800
so you pass into the other screen

15:36.800 --> 15:38.700
and you naturally go too quick to see this gap

15:38.700 --> 15:41.000
and you go over it thinking you'll drop down

15:41.000 --> 15:42.300
but instead you hop over it

15:42.300 --> 15:44.400
teaching you instantly what the bike does.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.300
This little section,

15:46.300 --> 15:48.300
this little section with this guy

15:48.300 --> 15:51.200
and this bike is a very subtle tutorial

15:51.200 --> 15:53.000
not just for how to use this item

15:53.000 --> 15:54.700
but for the entire gameplay loop

15:54.700 --> 15:56.000
that leads to getting it,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
making careful use of items,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.800
party members best serve using items

15:59.800 --> 16:02.200
instead of attacking, building a party,

16:02.200 --> 16:05.300
and gathering the resources to afford to build a party.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.100
The game makes a joke about tutorials

16:07.100 --> 16:09.200
having silly signs Terry left up

16:09.200 --> 16:11.900
that teach basic stuff and mostly glorify Terry

16:11.900 --> 16:13.400
but then it goes one further

16:13.400 --> 16:16.600
and teaches you how to play it seemingly effortlessly.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.900
Honestly, game designers like this

16:18.900 --> 16:20.800
should be running our school system.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.500
There's also almost no fluff to the game's mechanics.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
The game's currency, dirty magazines,

16:25.500 --> 16:26.900
hey, it's a world without women.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.500
What else is gonna represent value?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.800
is pretty rare.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.300
There's not many to find in the world

16:31.300 --> 16:32.200
or through side quests

16:32.200 --> 16:34.100
and outside of a few specific areas,

16:34.100 --> 16:36.100
there's no real way to grind them either.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.700
There's a finite amount of people and mutants to fight

16:38.700 --> 16:40.900
and almost all of them are unique characters

16:40.900 --> 16:42.900
so since outside of grinding,

16:42.900 --> 16:45.300
there's basically a precise amount of mags,

16:45.300 --> 16:46.900
you can't buy everything you want

16:46.900 --> 16:49.500
and don't have easy access to infinite healing items.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.800
You have to ration them out,

16:50.800 --> 16:53.600
make careful use of characters with heal abilities,

16:53.600 --> 16:55.400
occasionally risk sleeping,

16:55.400 --> 16:58.300
use the very limited firebomb resources in tougher fights,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.400
and somehow in the middle of all this

17:00.400 --> 17:02.900
afford to get new items and party members.

17:02.900 --> 17:06.400
There's basically no free or simple choices in Lisa

17:06.400 --> 17:07.900
and this makes almost every decision

17:07.900 --> 17:10.100
in every encounter nail-biting.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.000
It's very rare that games come along

17:12.000 --> 17:14.600
that invoke this kind of anxiety in players.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.500
Design-wise, Lisa equals XCOM or Darkest Dungeon

17:17.500 --> 17:19.600
for its mechanical tightness and deadliness

17:19.600 --> 17:22.200
and for its emotional tautness too.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.400
It's also incredibly thematically interesting

17:24.400 --> 17:25.700
to have so many things threatened

17:25.700 --> 17:27.100
to get in the way of survival.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.000
Characters being unable to perform at their best

17:29.000 --> 17:31.500
because they're crying or drunk or hungover

17:31.500 --> 17:32.900
or bleeding or depressed

17:32.900 --> 17:34.700
or going through withdrawal symptoms

17:34.700 --> 17:36.800
ties directly into the story of the game,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.500
a story about characters whose judgment

17:38.500 --> 17:40.400
is poorly compromised by trauma

17:40.400 --> 17:42.900
or bad experiences or drug abuse.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.700
Taking a step forward always costs money or items

17:45.700 --> 17:47.200
or often a character's life.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.000
The Lisa games are all about this sense

17:49.000 --> 17:51.800
of losing pieces of yourself to a traumatic world,

17:51.800 --> 17:53.000
often literally,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.600
and trying to escape the worst of its effects

17:55.600 --> 17:57.100
to limited results.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.300
Some of the characters you fight

17:58.300 --> 17:59.700
are quite clearly manifestations

17:59.700 --> 18:01.600
of Brad's joy-altered psyche

18:01.600 --> 18:03.300
giving life to his imagination.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.000
The spiders you fight quite a lot in the painful

18:05.000 --> 18:07.100
are very similar to the ones Lisa had to face

18:07.100 --> 18:09.500
with the same man's face on them, no less.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.100
In a setting like this one with a story like this one,

18:12.100 --> 18:14.700
it makes sense to be confronted very often with scenarios

18:14.700 --> 18:16.100
where everyone's just a little bit

18:16.100 --> 18:17.400
too out of their right mind

18:17.400 --> 18:19.200
to deal with what's happening to them.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.300
Speaking of trauma,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.100
the story of the painful is fascinating

18:22.100 --> 18:24.200
in how it tackles similar ideas to the original

18:24.200 --> 18:25.700
but in a more active way.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.200
The first was a very internal conflict,

18:28.200 --> 18:29.700
the main characters trying and failing

18:29.700 --> 18:32.200
in their own imagination to escape an abusive life

18:32.200 --> 18:34.900
and try to at least find some peace and calm

18:34.900 --> 18:36.100
within themselves,

18:36.100 --> 18:37.800
but instead they're repeatedly confronted

18:37.800 --> 18:40.600
with their abuser and horrific manifestations of them

18:40.600 --> 18:42.000
and what they inflicted on them.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I think the painful takes a more interesting

18:44.000 --> 18:45.400
and considered road.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.000
While you're trapped almost completely

18:47.000 --> 18:48.800
in Brad's perception of his world,

18:48.800 --> 18:50.200
his actions are real

18:50.200 --> 18:52.200
and have consequences that affect others.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.400
His choices in how he dealt with his trauma,

18:54.400 --> 18:55.500
how he raised Buddy,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
and how he reacts when she's taken,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.600
these are all reactions to his experiences

18:59.600 --> 19:01.100
and how they shaped his view of the world

19:01.100 --> 19:02.200
and how to act in it.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
I've spoken about the game's difficult choices,

19:04.200 --> 19:05.500
but what's equally informative

19:05.500 --> 19:07.900
is the places where the game takes choice away from you

19:07.900 --> 19:09.600
or presents you with false choices

19:09.600 --> 19:11.800
or doesn't even point out the alternatives

19:11.800 --> 19:13.200
that simply didn't occur to Brad

19:13.200 --> 19:14.900
because of the person he's become,

19:14.900 --> 19:16.600
not entirely of his own volition.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.100
Brad blames himself for what happened to Lisa,

19:19.100 --> 19:22.100
becomes a martial artist as a post-hoc self-defense mechanism

19:22.100 --> 19:23.300
against the abuse he suffered,

19:23.300 --> 19:25.700
and raises Buddy the best he can,

19:25.700 --> 19:27.300
but the best he can is to shelter her

19:27.300 --> 19:29.400
from a world of people that hurt him and his sister

19:29.400 --> 19:30.500
when they were young.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.200
This itself paves the way for Buddy

19:32.200 --> 19:34.100
to become the person she ends up being.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.700
When she's kidnapped from Brad's care,

19:35.700 --> 19:37.400
or perhaps to put it a better way,

19:37.400 --> 19:39.200
escapes from Brad's care,

19:39.200 --> 19:41.300
Brad immediately takes this as a justification

19:41.300 --> 19:44.200
for perhaps what he's been training for his entire life,

19:44.200 --> 19:46.000
a rampage in which all he does

19:46.000 --> 19:48.900
is try to protect someone he sees as vulnerable.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.100
Many characters offer Brad other options

19:51.100 --> 19:53.300
or question why he personally

19:53.300 --> 19:55.100
should be the one deciding how to raise

19:55.100 --> 19:58.600
or deal with the existence of the only girl left in the world,

19:58.600 --> 20:01.200
and he doesn't even really consider these questions

20:01.200 --> 20:03.400
because for him, the answer was obvious.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.900
He pushes past these questions

20:04.900 --> 20:07.400
all the way to what a game would normally position

20:07.400 --> 20:09.000
as a heroic final stand

20:09.000 --> 20:11.700
where he finally starts to quite literally transform

20:11.700 --> 20:14.500
into a monster and enters a haze of violence

20:14.500 --> 20:17.600
where the background is just a chaotic swirl of colors

20:17.600 --> 20:20.500
and even an army of enemies are horrified.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.800
Brad is unable to pursue other courses of action

20:22.800 --> 20:25.300
because of who his experiences have made him into.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.000
The joy that he's become addicted to

20:27.000 --> 20:29.600
is described as making you feel nothing.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.400
It's very clear why something like that

20:31.400 --> 20:34.000
would become a crutch for someone who's lived Brad's life.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.500
By doing this, the story positions

20:35.500 --> 20:37.200
a lot of traditional heroism tropes

20:37.200 --> 20:39.300
as the result of a warped perspective.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.700
One of the last lines in the game

20:40.700 --> 20:42.700
before the final battle starts is,

20:42.700 --> 20:45.900
"'I've been dead for 35 years. Today I live.'"

20:45.900 --> 20:47.800
This is the first time in most of Brad's life

20:47.800 --> 20:49.300
that the world makes sense,

20:49.300 --> 20:51.900
him against what he sees as an army of villains

20:51.900 --> 20:53.600
preventing him from being a father.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.900
It's the only narrative that makes sense to him,

20:55.900 --> 20:57.300
and the game encourages the player

20:57.300 --> 20:58.700
to think about what went wrong

20:58.700 --> 21:00.900
and why he can't think about it.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.300
There are also places where the player

21:02.300 --> 21:03.600
is offered a direct choice,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.400
such as fighting or sparing his father

21:05.400 --> 21:07.100
once he finally encounters him again,

21:07.100 --> 21:08.700
which is itself a false one.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.100
While you can choose to try to spare him,

21:11.100 --> 21:12.900
Brad cannot resist himself.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.500
This is an important creative choice,

21:14.500 --> 21:15.900
or at least an honest one.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.200
Everyone wants to believe

21:17.200 --> 21:18.900
they're in full control of themselves,

21:18.900 --> 21:21.200
but quite simply, sometimes we aren't.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.800
Humans aren't rational actors.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.200
Brad's been fighting manifestations of this man

21:25.200 --> 21:26.900
all his life already.

21:26.900 --> 21:27.900
What's one more?

21:31.900 --> 21:34.900
The Painful is, fittingly,

21:34.900 --> 21:36.600
a game about pain.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.900
It's about the suffering we can experience in our lives

21:38.900 --> 21:41.100
and how it can stick with us whether we want it to or not

21:41.100 --> 21:43.800
and influence us in ways we don't always want to see

21:43.800 --> 21:45.700
and in turn go on to make us hurt others

21:45.700 --> 21:47.500
even when we think what we're doing is right,

21:47.500 --> 21:49.700
and the hurt we cause impacts them too.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.500
It doesn't always offer an easy solution.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.900
There's no magical pill that undoes childhood trauma

21:54.900 --> 21:57.100
or allows complete control of one's actions.

21:57.100 --> 22:00.400
It puts out the scary idea that none of us are free

22:00.400 --> 22:03.300
because we're prisoners of the events and lives we've lived,

22:03.300 --> 22:05.800
but there's a certain hopefulness to it too.

22:05.800 --> 22:09.000
For all his mistakes and inabilities to make better choices

22:09.000 --> 22:11.200
and drug or trauma-induced violence

22:11.200 --> 22:13.200
he can't stop himself from committing,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.200
there are still real choices to make,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.000
and these choices still have meaning.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.500
There are places where Brad is marginally making things better

22:19.500 --> 22:22.000
for some people or at least tries to,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.200
and there are often times when you can literally choose

22:24.200 --> 22:27.400
to lose pieces of yourself to try and keep others alive.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.700
These little choices are meaningful and valuable.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.800
The game rightfully acknowledges this by having multiple endings.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.500
If you manage to outside of cutscenes

22:36.500 --> 22:39.800
never take the combat-enhancing but addictive item Joy,

22:39.800 --> 22:42.700
an item designed to be used in harder fights

22:42.700 --> 22:44.800
that's quite difficult to go without using,

22:44.800 --> 22:47.200
the ending is very slightly different,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.300
and if you manage to finish the game in pain mode

22:49.300 --> 22:52.300
where everything is tougher and save points can only be used once,

22:52.300 --> 22:54.700
the ending is again just a little bit different.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.200
I think the point of these endings

22:56.200 --> 22:59.400
is that things can be different, even a little, if we try,

22:59.400 --> 23:00.800
and that makes trying worthwhile

23:00.800 --> 23:03.000
even if it doesn't always amount to something.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.300
The point isn't that Brad is a good person

23:05.300 --> 23:07.500
but that he has the potential to do better,

23:07.500 --> 23:08.600
as everyone does,

23:08.600 --> 23:11.500
and start asking the right questions about himself,

23:11.500 --> 23:13.000
and this is a hopeful thing.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.100
The final choice in the game is buddies,

23:15.100 --> 23:17.300
whether or not to hug Brad and empathize with him

23:17.300 --> 23:18.800
in spite of the pain he's caused her

23:18.800 --> 23:21.400
and the life she will live as a result of this.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.600
This is a difficult choice

23:22.600 --> 23:25.400
and arguably an ultimately meaningless one.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.200
Do you hug a dying man or not?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.400
It doesn't matter, but it's a real choice

23:29.400 --> 23:31.100
in a world of many false ones.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.700
Brad wasn't a good person,

23:32.700 --> 23:34.100
but he didn't have as much of a say

23:34.100 --> 23:35.800
in what kind of person he ended up being

23:35.800 --> 23:36.900
as he'd have liked,

23:36.900 --> 23:40.300
and the idea that things could maybe have turned out better

23:40.300 --> 23:42.600
and helped him make better choices

23:42.600 --> 23:44.400
is the real hope of the story.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.200
It's a hard-won victory to tell a story

23:46.200 --> 23:48.000
in which nothing good happens to anyone

23:48.000 --> 23:50.500
and the character you play isn't a good person,

23:50.500 --> 23:53.300
but you're left feeling like people still have the potential

23:53.300 --> 23:54.500
to do better.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.000
This is something the final game,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.100
Lisa the Joyful,

23:57.100 --> 23:59.000
does its best to call back into question

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
with somewhat mixed results.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.600
Lisa the Joyful's first segments

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
are an excellent microcosm of the positives

24:16.600 --> 24:18.400
and negatives of its overall story.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.100
It opens incredibly strongly

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
with a revelation about what Buddy was learning

24:22.100 --> 24:24.600
during the upbringing we only saw in fleeting glimpses

24:24.600 --> 24:26.400
during the opening of the previous game.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.800
Buddy is forced by Brad to kill someone

24:28.800 --> 24:31.200
in order to begin to learn how to defend herself.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.600
This shows us how she was able to escape capture

24:33.600 --> 24:35.000
so easily in the previous games

24:35.000 --> 24:37.800
and lets us a little into how she'll have come to see the world

24:37.800 --> 24:39.800
and, of course, showcases Brad's own views

24:39.800 --> 24:41.700
about that world in detail, too.

24:41.700 --> 24:44.100
I always wondered who killed this guy on the counter here,

24:44.100 --> 24:45.900
and the answer is probably Buddy.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.400
♪♪

24:48.400 --> 24:51.200
♪♪

24:51.200 --> 24:53.600
But then, after a cool cut to the title,

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
it cuts to black,

24:54.600 --> 24:57.000
and we get some regular expository dialogue

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
about what two characters were yet to really learn about are up to,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.500
implying various things about character relationships

25:02.500 --> 25:04.700
and the reasons why the world is the way it is.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.400
We then cut to immediately after the ending of the previous game

25:07.400 --> 25:09.200
where things continue in Media Res.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
These twin openings are an indicator

25:11.200 --> 25:13.600
of the two roles the Joyful has to fill.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.500
The Joyful was a stretch goal for the Kickstarter for the Painful,

25:16.500 --> 25:18.700
the mission statement being that you'll play as Buddy

25:18.700 --> 25:21.500
and uncover the truth behind the world of Lisa,

25:21.500 --> 25:24.400
but it turns out those are very separate things entirely

25:24.400 --> 25:26.900
and actually quite jarring when done together.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.400
The world of Lisa is interesting and mysterious,

25:29.400 --> 25:31.000
but part of what made it those things

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
was that you were exploring it as a byproduct

25:33.000 --> 25:34.700
of a much more personal story

25:34.700 --> 25:37.200
where the apocalypse was just a way of putting these characters

25:37.200 --> 25:39.100
into more extreme circumstances.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.900
Exploring it in more detail or explaining it outright

25:41.900 --> 25:44.500
would have detracted from the engaging personal story,

25:44.500 --> 25:46.000
taken time away from it,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.400
and, well, it would have ruined the mystery.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
You can carve a really sharp divide

25:50.400 --> 25:52.800
between the parts that are about kinda just expositing

25:52.800 --> 25:54.900
what happened in the past involving Lisa

25:54.900 --> 25:57.600
or implying what happened to the world and who's behind it

25:57.600 --> 26:00.600
and retroactively explaining the events of the previous game

26:00.600 --> 26:03.100
and the parts that make up this really interesting story

26:03.100 --> 26:05.400
about the last girl in a world full of monsters

26:05.400 --> 26:06.900
trying to become its new ruler

26:06.900 --> 26:09.600
by crossing every other warlord off a giant list

26:09.600 --> 26:12.100
and becoming a little bit of a monster herself on the way.

26:12.100 --> 26:15.100
The latter is really new and unique and interesting

26:15.100 --> 26:17.800
while building on the themes and story we already know,

26:17.800 --> 26:20.400
but the former is unnecessary and explains things

26:20.400 --> 26:21.600
that don't need explaining

26:21.600 --> 26:23.900
because they're not really what the story was about.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.400
This doesn't just mean half the story

26:25.400 --> 26:26.700
isn't as good as it could be.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.100
It also drags focus away from Buddy's story

26:29.100 --> 26:30.900
and weakens that half a little too.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.300
It's not the worst thing in the world,

26:32.300 --> 26:34.700
but I think more focus on Buddy and her choices

26:34.700 --> 26:36.500
would have resulted in a much more engaging

26:36.500 --> 26:38.200
and tighter story overall.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.200
That said, the story that is there for Buddy

26:40.200 --> 26:41.300
is honestly great.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.600
Where Brad decided that for the safety of himself

26:43.600 --> 26:45.600
and his loved ones, he had to close his problems off

26:45.600 --> 26:48.000
from the world and hide from the people who threatened them,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.900
hoping to keep them a secret forever,

26:49.900 --> 26:52.000
Buddy learned the exact opposite lesson

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and concluded that the only way to be safe

26:54.000 --> 26:56.900
was to kill everyone who could possibly pose a threat

26:56.900 --> 26:58.100
and take control.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.700
She's literally crossing names off a list

27:00.700 --> 27:03.500
and slowly imagining more and more violence around her

27:03.500 --> 27:04.500
as she does so.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.300
The fun thing about stories with parental dynamics like this,

27:07.300 --> 27:09.600
similar to some chapters of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

27:09.600 --> 27:11.500
is through one character's behavior,

27:11.500 --> 27:14.000
you simultaneously get to learn about that character

27:14.000 --> 27:16.100
and the people who made them that way.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.600
A good deal of Buddy's behavior reflects back onto Brad

27:18.600 --> 27:19.800
and the lessons she'd have learned

27:19.800 --> 27:21.200
either through his direct teachings

27:21.200 --> 27:23.300
or through having to live with someone like him.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.000
You're still learning about precisely what happened to Lisa

27:26.000 --> 27:29.300
and what she did about it through how Brad and Buddy act,

27:29.300 --> 27:30.600
and that's fascinating.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.800
The massive cast of party members from the Painful

27:32.800 --> 27:34.000
is not a feature here.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.200
You just get Buddy and temporarily Rando

27:36.200 --> 27:38.100
while Buddy levels up and the player gets the hang

27:38.100 --> 27:39.500
of her new gameplay style.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.900
While I said having lots of characters

27:40.900 --> 27:43.600
that you could choose from and risk losing was cool,

27:43.600 --> 27:46.100
having less characters isn't specifically a bad thing.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.100
Instead, the focus is on having one character

27:48.100 --> 27:49.800
whose moves are more mechanically dense

27:49.800 --> 27:52.200
than any individual character previously,

27:52.200 --> 27:55.100
giving her both the ability to induce numerous status effects

27:55.100 --> 27:57.300
like Flustered, Sleep, Bleed, and Poison

27:57.300 --> 27:59.500
and a slew of generally good attacks, too.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.700
Buddy's stronger attacks have a timing minigame

28:01.700 --> 28:03.000
which can be quite tough to master

28:03.000 --> 28:05.300
but are highly necessary for persevering.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.300
Joy makes a return and the game's hallucinatory tutorials

28:08.300 --> 28:11.600
from Buddy's psyche even quite strongly advise you to use it.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.400
Apparently, the use joy messages were added in a patch

28:14.400 --> 28:16.400
when players had trouble proceeding without it,

28:16.400 --> 28:18.900
committed to not using joy the way many did in the Painful

28:18.900 --> 28:20.100
because they knew there was an ending

28:20.100 --> 28:21.700
specifically for not using it.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.100
There is no such ending here,

28:23.100 --> 28:25.400
meaning the joy mechanic can be properly used

28:25.400 --> 28:27.600
by folks who skipped out on it before like me.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.500
The story isn't the only thing that's divided.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.700
The gameplay and story suffer from a much sharper divide, too.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.400
Where the previous game had the almost magical interaction

28:35.400 --> 28:38.100
between story choices and their gameplay consequences,

28:38.100 --> 28:40.200
no such choices pop up for Buddy.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.700
There are a couple of moments where you're given

28:41.700 --> 28:44.100
the sort of typical moral choice of little consequence

28:44.100 --> 28:45.700
you would see in inferior RPGs

28:45.700 --> 28:48.100
like deciding whether or not to drop Rando into the pit

28:48.100 --> 28:50.400
or whether or not to attack the pacifists.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.800
It's a bit disappointing.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.000
Worse, with the Rando choice,

28:53.000 --> 28:54.600
it doesn't matter which choice you make.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.500
It results in slightly different exposition

28:56.500 --> 28:58.100
and maybe lets you skip a fight,

28:58.100 --> 29:00.000
but the same things play out no matter what

29:00.000 --> 29:02.400
with no further impact on story or gameplay.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.700
But with the pacifists, there's this chilling aspect

29:04.700 --> 29:06.100
showing how far Buddy has gone

29:06.100 --> 29:07.700
where you can't even talk to them

29:07.700 --> 29:10.100
and attempting to or even walking past them

29:10.100 --> 29:12.700
asks you once again if you want to fight them or not.

29:12.700 --> 29:16.400
Every few steps, Buddy has to actively choose not to murder,

29:16.400 --> 29:18.100
which, of course, is the highlighted option

29:18.100 --> 29:19.800
like it's her first instinct.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.000
You're never given any really difficult choices.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.200
You never have to risk losing any useful items.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.400
In fact, there aren't really any of the rarer items

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
from the painful that would relieve harmful effects

29:28.400 --> 29:30.700
in a pinch like the poison-curing cigarettes

29:30.700 --> 29:32.500
you find, like, six of in the whole game

29:32.500 --> 29:34.000
because lots of the tougher effects

29:34.000 --> 29:35.900
have been taken out entirely to support a game

29:35.900 --> 29:37.700
with largely only one character.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.000
There's basically no point to the shopkeeper at all

29:40.000 --> 29:41.200
and the main path through the game

29:41.200 --> 29:42.800
gives you an abundance of joy,

29:42.800 --> 29:44.800
so item management is basically gone

29:44.800 --> 29:47.000
and all the party member reviving perfume you get

29:47.000 --> 29:49.300
only matters for a very short period anyway

29:49.300 --> 29:50.800
because you're on your own.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.000
This ruins what could have been

29:52.000 --> 29:54.300
a much more delicate balance of items.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.100
Honestly, my expectations for the joyful

29:56.100 --> 29:57.900
in the first hour were super high.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.400
I was imagining all the different ways

29:59.500 --> 30:00.900
a version of this battle system

30:00.900 --> 30:02.500
but mechanically based around having

30:02.500 --> 30:04.100
just one character could work.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.700
Status effects, item management,

30:05.700 --> 30:07.600
TP management, learning the timing

30:07.600 --> 30:09.600
of the better attacks, making the best use

30:09.600 --> 30:11.700
of your one turn per round in a fight

30:11.700 --> 30:14.300
could become scalpel-sharp concentrations

30:14.300 --> 30:17.200
of important choices and a robust inventory system

30:17.200 --> 30:19.000
where defense and armor have to be balanced

30:19.000 --> 30:20.700
against resistance or speed

30:20.700 --> 30:23.600
or trying not to get stunned or tripped or poisoned.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.900
This could have made for a really

30:24.900 --> 30:26.500
mechanically dense game.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.600
I was fully prepared to say that the joyful

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
had the best gameplay of the three games,

30:30.600 --> 30:33.900
and while this theoretical version of Lisa

30:33.900 --> 30:35.900
does almost rear its head in a few

30:35.900 --> 30:37.700
of the tougher fights against larger groups

30:37.700 --> 30:39.800
or if you commit to not taking Joy,

30:39.800 --> 30:42.100
it never really feels like you're being challenged

30:42.100 --> 30:43.900
in any way other than nailing the timing

30:43.900 --> 30:45.500
on Buddy's more damaging attacks.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.100
I think the gameplay is still overall

30:47.100 --> 30:48.700
very fun and really challenging,

30:48.700 --> 30:50.500
but the awareness of how much better

30:50.500 --> 30:52.000
this approach could have been

30:52.000 --> 30:54.300
makes it feel like a missed opportunity at times.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.500
One of the best and sadly only examples

30:56.500 --> 30:58.000
of gameplay and story overlapping

30:58.000 --> 31:00.100
is that your other party member Rando's attacks

31:00.100 --> 31:01.800
are also called Armstrong-style

31:01.800 --> 31:03.600
because Brad trained him as a kid.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.800
That's just really cute.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.600
The soundtrack, in addition to containing

31:06.600 --> 31:09.300
even more heavily distorted and speed-shifted versions

31:09.300 --> 31:11.400
of previous tracks, has a bunch of new ones

31:11.400 --> 31:13.000
with an increased reliance on samples

31:13.000 --> 31:15.700
including new instruments, vocals, and even air horns.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.800
I remember putting a playlist of Lisa music

31:17.800 --> 31:20.000
on at a friend's house, and once it transitioned

31:20.000 --> 31:22.800
into tracks from the joyful, he made me stop.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.000
I really like the music,

31:24.000 --> 31:25.700
not just because I have horrible taste,

31:25.700 --> 31:28.500
but because its use in the game is perfect.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.200
Tracks like the almost abominable

31:30.200 --> 31:33.500
666 Kill Chop Deluxe play during tougher boss fights,

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
and it's not just fitting but complementary

31:35.500 --> 31:38.700
to the sense of being trapped in the hellish storm

31:38.700 --> 31:41.500
of drug-infused violence Buddy has become.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.300
This soundtrack is the most complementary to a game

31:44.300 --> 31:47.000
since Fallout New Vegas or even Planescape Torment.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.400
There's something to be said about the engagement

31:49.400 --> 31:50.700
I felt with the joyful.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.100
In Painful, my first time through,

31:52.100 --> 31:54.200
I was almost afraid to open it back up again

31:54.200 --> 31:56.400
and see how much worse things could get for Brad,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.200
find out who in my party I'd become attached to

31:58.200 --> 31:59.800
I'd lose trying to find Buddy.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.600
Joyful, fittingly for its title,

32:01.600 --> 32:03.800
makes you feel like you have nothing to lose.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.300
I took a break partway through Joyful

32:05.300 --> 32:07.400
and couldn't wait to open it back up and finish it

32:07.400 --> 32:09.300
and continue crossing names off the list.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.900
There's something incredibly appealing

32:10.900 --> 32:13.000
about Buddy's journey in spite of everything negative

32:13.000 --> 32:14.200
I've said about the story.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.000
Spoilers for the plot in case you somehow made it

32:16.000 --> 32:17.200
this far without playing.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.300
Eventually, Buddy kills everyone on the list,

32:19.300 --> 32:21.000
but then because the ending needs to explain

32:21.000 --> 32:22.300
the universe of Lisa,

32:22.400 --> 32:24.500
what follows is almost completely unrelated.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.900
Buddy suddenly meets the man who's behind everything.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.200
We get some exposition, a fairly easy fight,

32:29.200 --> 32:31.600
a few genuinely fantastic character-exploring

32:31.600 --> 32:33.300
hallucinations for a bit in the middle.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.800
Bozo explains the plot you and Buddy

32:35.800 --> 32:37.400
didn't really need to know about,

32:37.400 --> 32:40.200
and then Buddy gets to choose whether to mutate like Brad

32:40.200 --> 32:42.400
or cure herself using the Joy vaccine

32:42.400 --> 32:43.600
we just learned about

32:43.600 --> 32:45.900
and raise the next generation of humankind.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.400
This ending really kind of disappointed me.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.500
Like, mutating into a monster has so far been a metaphor

32:51.500 --> 32:53.800
for being taken over by your worst instincts.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.800
The transformation is fueled by joy,

32:55.800 --> 32:57.900
but wanting joy is fueled by having something

32:57.900 --> 33:00.600
eating you up inside until the joy ate you up

33:00.600 --> 33:02.300
and turned you into a monstrous expression

33:02.300 --> 33:03.700
of those feelings, for example,

33:03.700 --> 33:06.400
turning Brad into a monster obsessed with protecting Lisa

33:06.400 --> 33:07.900
and Buddy by proxy.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.800
I wrote the part of the script covering the painful

33:09.800 --> 33:12.400
a year ago before I finally decided to play Joyful,

33:12.400 --> 33:13.800
and what I liked about the problems

33:13.800 --> 33:15.500
that appeared in that game is that they're not something

33:15.500 --> 33:17.400
you can choose to walk away from.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.000
You take those parts of you everywhere,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and you can't just erase them from yourself.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.600
I literally wrote that there is no magic cure,

33:23.600 --> 33:26.000
so having the game end with Buddy able to quickly

33:26.000 --> 33:28.500
and easily choose to get over the traumatic life

33:28.500 --> 33:30.200
that led her to be the person she is

33:30.200 --> 33:32.200
instead of having to learn to deal with it

33:32.200 --> 33:34.100
in the sort of personal human way

33:34.100 --> 33:36.000
I'd come to expect from the series

33:36.000 --> 33:37.600
was really jarring to me.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.800
The skeleton of a really good story is still here,

33:39.800 --> 33:42.100
but it's obscured by having to be all the other things

33:42.100 --> 33:43.200
that it had to be,

33:43.200 --> 33:44.800
and this really deprives us of the chance

33:44.800 --> 33:46.800
to really explore Buddy and her choices

33:46.800 --> 33:49.800
and how she would even go about moving on from all this,

33:49.800 --> 33:51.500
but at the same time, I'm really touched

33:51.500 --> 33:54.400
that this series about sadness and tragedy and decline

33:54.400 --> 33:56.700
ends with a victim of abuse achieving what amounts

33:56.700 --> 33:59.500
to some sense of closure or even a happy ending

33:59.500 --> 34:02.000
and, earned or not, getting to put aside

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
their sadness and depression and self-loathing

34:04.000 --> 34:06.400
and escape into the possibilities of the future.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.700
I think it could have been done a lot better,

34:08.700 --> 34:11.200
but I really, really like what it did.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.400
In a way, playing this game as someone

34:13.400 --> 34:14.800
who thinks a lot about design

34:14.800 --> 34:17.300
and occasionally tries to make games of their own,

34:17.300 --> 34:19.500
there's something inspirational about it,

34:19.500 --> 34:21.700
like, the theoretical really good game

34:21.700 --> 34:23.800
I wanted it to be doesn't exist now,

34:23.800 --> 34:26.600
which means someone else gets to make that one.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.600
That someone else could even be you,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.700
and I think the truly fascinating power

34:30.700 --> 34:33.100
about really good games is they leave people

34:33.100 --> 34:35.600
with ideas about what they could do next.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.000
They spread the ideas and concepts further

34:38.000 --> 34:39.900
by being so good even if sometimes

34:39.900 --> 34:40.900
they leave you wanting

34:40.900 --> 34:43.200
or perhaps even by leaving you wanting.

34:43.200 --> 34:46.700
Lisa owes a debt of sorts to both Yume Nikki and EarthBound,

34:46.700 --> 34:48.700
which, of course, has inspired lots of other games,

34:48.700 --> 34:49.900
including Undertale,

34:49.900 --> 34:52.000
itself made by someone who also started out

34:52.000 --> 34:54.300
making what amounts to an EarthBound fangame.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.600
Some games are just excellent at spawning

34:56.600 --> 34:58.100
this desire to add to them,

34:58.100 --> 35:00.900
to create something using the ideas it leaves with you,

35:00.900 --> 35:04.200
and, fantastically, Lisa is doing just that.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.400
There's already at least two really fleshed-out Lisa fangames,

35:07.400 --> 35:09.400
Lisa the Hopeful and Lisa the Pointless,

35:09.400 --> 35:11.700
and who knows what great designers in the future

35:11.700 --> 35:14.500
might say Lisa was the inspiration for their own projects.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.800
In my opinion, Lisa is already doomed

35:16.800 --> 35:18.600
to enter the stream of history.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.600
I guarantee you 100%,

35:20.600 --> 35:22.900
one of the future best games ever made,

35:22.900 --> 35:25.000
one of the next indie mega-hits on Steam

35:25.000 --> 35:27.500
or whatever platform will make it into the next decade

35:27.500 --> 35:31.800
will be made by someone upon whom this game has left its mark.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.100
It's kind of funny.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.200
The games are all about trying to get over something,
