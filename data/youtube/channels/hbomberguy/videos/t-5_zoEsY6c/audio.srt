00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Austin Jorgensen's series Lisa is one of those cult hits,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,900
the kind where it's quite genuinely formed a cult of people who are really into it,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,600
but not many people outside the in-group really know that much about it.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,100
This is probably because it's hard to talk about.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,900
It's got a lot of really funny moments,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,900
some excellent examples of great writing or perfect comedic timing,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,700
but unlike, for example, Undertale,

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,800
the story's content has some pretty gruesome and uncomfortable material.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,400
It enters into an artistic territory where you'd need to know someone pretty well

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
to feel okay recommending it to them.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
It explores themes that can be quite difficult to talk about

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,700
and which plenty of people quite justifiably don't want to,

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,100
and the game is too good at focusing on what it wants to be about

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,900
that you can't ignore it and just focus on something else.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,500
There's a process in modern game discourse I like to call memification.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,300
To be a little bit cynical, if you wanted to for easy clicks,

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,300
there are some games you can invent reasons to talk about if you need to.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,900
The game's story and themes are loose and friendly and open enough

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,500
that you can reapply the critical lens over and over

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,300
and always have a new, somewhat facile element to explore for an audience.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,700
You can speculate for all time about some games

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,100
if they have certain features that make it easy to do so.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,800
You could even do a needlessly in-depth analysis

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,500
of one character's relationship with anime.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
No way, that one was mine, wasn't it?

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
But when someone like that attempts to play Lisa,

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,100
a game whose themes are unavoidable and specific and beautiful and horrific and sad,

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,900
the best one could say is,

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,800
this reminds me of Undertale.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,600
The only way to relate the experience through such a critically dysfunctional perspective

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,700
is by using the lens of one of the two or three games you can talk about endlessly

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,500
before going back to talking about them endlessly.

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,900
Also, um, Lisa came out quite a bit before Undertale.

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
Just saying, man.

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,600
This is not a criticism of Undertale or the pretend-to-think-about-games economy,

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
although I guess on some level it kind of is both of those.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Rather, I'm laboring to point out that Lisa doesn't get talked about too much

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,500
because by its nature, the reasons why it's good can be hard to talk about.

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,700
With that in mind, I'm going to talk about it here

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,600
and spoil aspects of the plots of all three of the games

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,800
while not specifically summarizing them in explicit detail.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,700
I would highly recommend pausing the video here and playing the games for yourself.

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
They're all either cheap or free,

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,100
so there isn't much of an excuse not to,

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,000
and I don't want to preemptively ruin your experience.

Most people probably at least vaguely know of Yume Nikki or Dream Diary,

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,400
a free game made in an early version of RPG Maker

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
in which you control a girl named Madotsuki who refuses to leave her room.

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Instead, she can go to bed and enter her dreams.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,100
The game is light on plot,

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,700
instead relying on exploration and curiosity about the dream worlds you visit and how they work.

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,000
You can collect items which have some uses,

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,100
but I wouldn't really say the game has puzzles, per se.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,500
It functions more as a dream itself, floating from area to area

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,700
as interesting and sometimes random events happen at you.

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,500
The game's well-known largely because of some of these events,

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,700

and this has a 1 in 64 chance of even happening.

I, uh, actually had to steal this footage.

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
While the game doesn't really have a plot,

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,400
it has buckets of story if you feel like interpreting the ideas it throws at you.

The reasons Madotsuki doesn't want to go out into the world for real

70

are made astonishingly clear in her dreams.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
The game is, really, an exploration of one character's psyche

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,700
and what they think about in their most unguarded moments.

73
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,100
People think they can escape into their dreams,

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
but you bring your mind with you,

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,700
and if the thing you're trying to escape from had such a big impact on you,

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,400
you're not getting away so easily.

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,600
While the game is often praised for being weird or random,

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Yume Nikki has a good deal of clarity of purpose

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
and probably resonates with people

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,300
because the experiences and ideas it explores are almost universal.

81
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,400
Almost everyone knows something bad could happen to them if they went outside,

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,700
so playing to the paranoia that can come from that

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,900
reaches a lot of people in parts of themselves

84
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,400
they don't often realize are there.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,500
Yume Nikki was pretty impactful for a free RPG Maker game.

86
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,400
There's several fan games and even more original but overtly inspired works,

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,400
and one of them is Lisa, now called Lisa the First.

88
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Lisa is a story about a girl trapped in an abusive home trying to imagine her escape,

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,500
but even in her own imagination, her experiences follow her everywhere.

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,600
The similarities are already clear, but the differences are interesting.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Trying to find an escape does involve collecting and using various items to progress,

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
which is a little more direct than how Yume Nikki does it,

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
but the themes are also much more direct,

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
making them somewhat more impactful.

95
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
Almost every character is portrayed by Lisa's abusive father,

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,000
and trying to play to the bizarre whims of this rather singular cast

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
is in its own way kind of depressing and scary.

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,800
I'd recommend people play as much of the game as they can

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,900
until they find a puzzle they don't know how to solve

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,900
or get sick of dying to the spiders with the father's face on them

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,800
and then watch a playthrough of someone who knows what they're doing on YouTube.

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,500
It doesn't really hold up as a game,

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,000
but as a story, as an exploration of a mind, as an atmosphere,

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
it's emotionally quite an experience.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,900
An idea that starts here and prevails throughout the series

106
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,400
and is one of its best features is the reuse of music from previous areas,

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
but at different speeds.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
These stories put you in the mind of characters

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
whose psyche is damaged by their experiences,

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
and having even the music second-guess your memory of how it sounds

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
is really disconcerting.

112
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,100
It's cool getting the opportunity to see a work

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,900

120

121

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,000
You might actually genuinely need the items you can find

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
as opposed to a lot of RPGs

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
where most of the stuff feels optional

177
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
or just, like, another potion or something.

178
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
This causes the player to invest more

179
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
in trying to find these things

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
which makes the game more engaging

181
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,700
and very effectively puts you into the role

182
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,900
of someone scavenging a broken wasteland

183
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,300
for anything of value.

184
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,900
I made a video last year exploring ludonarrative,

185
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,100
the idea that while games can have stories,

186
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,400
the actual story was the player's experience

187
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,300
of the game itself through its mechanics

188
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,500
and really engaging games forge an emotional perspective

189
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,600
for the player to occupy

190
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
through good execution of those mechanics

191
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,100
and Lisa might be the best game I've ever seen at this.

192
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,600
It's one of few games where I've had a bad outcome,

193
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
lost someone permanently in a hard fight

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,900
a long way off from my last save

195
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,700
or almost all of my party to Russian roulette

196
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,900
and continued because I'd come so far

197
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,600
and didn't want to have to go all the way back

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
or worse off, had no idea how much worse it would be

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
if I tried again.

200
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,000
I save scum like a madman in games when I can,

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,800
like I have a folder on my hard drive

202
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
full of Darkest Dungeon and XCOM saves just in case

203
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
but Lisa makes pressing on despite what comes by you

204
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
feel like the right thing to do

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,000
and always makes it inconvenient enough

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that the alternative, loading a save,

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,700
feels like a punishment itself that you want to avoid.

208
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
You have to press on because the last save point

209
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,800
was way back there

210
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,500
and who knows how many people you'll lose next time.

211
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,200
There are several points where the player is told

212
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
to make a choice between losing everything they have

213
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,900
or a person's life or one of Brad's arms.

214
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,600
These choices aren't reversible and can't be worked around.

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
Losing one or both arms permanently alters

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
the mechanics and abilities of the one party member

217
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
you'll always have,

218
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
losing a party member whose abilities

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
you probably need to survive,

220
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
losing all the firebombs and equipment

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,300
keeping you alive.

222
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,100
These are all choices that are difficult

223
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,900
and each genuinely make the game harder.

224
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,400
You actually want, because of the game's mechanics,

225
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,200
to keep all of these people

226
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,700
because they're relevant not to the game's story

227
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,200
but to your ability to get through the game

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
and this means being forced to choose

229
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,500
is more painful than most other decisions in video games.

230
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
If these characters were just other characters

231
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,000
in the story that was also happening

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
while I was playing an unrelated RPG in fights,

233
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,100
this wouldn't have mattered at all,

234
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
but when someone threatens Terry,

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,700
your best friend, more on Terry later,

236
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
that means something.

237
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
These characters have mechanical value to the player

238
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
who might well have come to rely on them in fights.

239
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Fascinatingly, most of the characters in your party

240
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
in Lisa don't matter to the main story whatsoever,

241
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
but I cared more about their survival

242
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,500
because they were important to me.

243
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Having to choose to go without items to keep them

244
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
or learn to press on without them

245
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,200
because losing all your healing items

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,500
and money and firebombs just isn't manageable

247
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,100
is a real choice that you have to account for.

248
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,900
I can imagine having characters or items taken away

249
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
being frustrating for some players,

250
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,400
but it's absolutely fitting to this one story

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,700
and I do think that frustration is itself compelling.

252
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
The same way that having to send Simpsons hentai

253
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
to the brothel to keep them from losing their mind

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
completely was in Darkest Dungeon.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
There's also a lot of random events

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
that trigger when you sleep to recover your health,

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,900
events like losing party members

258
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,000
and having to get them back

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
or everyone getting badly poisoned

260
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
or just stuff getting stolen.

261
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
These sorts of things create a quite genuine paranoia

262
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
in the player because, again, you want all that stuff.

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
You learn to only take the risk when you really need to,

264
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,300
and this paranoia puts you into the same sort of mindset

265
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
as Brad who sees Lisa everywhere,

266
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
looking down and judging him.

267
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,200
This, again, builds on a mechanic from Yume Nikki.

268
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Random events happened in that game,

269
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,700
but they didn't affect the gameplay all that much

270
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
and they didn't even really affect the story

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
unless you're a pretentious weirdo

272
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,700
who likes to read into things.

273
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,200
Lisa builds a universe where you can randomly lose

274
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,500
someone important to you and that's scary and threatening

275
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,000
and makes you afraid to go to sleep in the game,

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
and while that's not technically a fair mechanic,

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,500
it's a powerful mechanic

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
and that's actually more important

279
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,200
than the game being balanced or fair.

280
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
The gameplay and story exist to get across the same ideas

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
and do it by affecting each other

282
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,900
in much more direct ways than most RPGs.

283
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
There's even a section where,

284
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,200
upon being told to choose between losing

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
what will probably be at that point your second arm

286
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,600
or losing all your items,

287
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
you have the third option of asking the character

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
why they're doing this to you,

289
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
and while you're briefly offered the chance

290
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,000
of seeing past this facade,

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,800
he then takes both your arm and all your items

292
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
as a seemingly purposeful attack on games

293
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,300
that offer easy ways out,

294
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,400
where you can sweet-talk your way past a choice

295
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,500
that it should have been hard.

296
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,100
The player is punished for believing

297
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,400
it would be so simple.

298
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,000
While it would have been easy to load a save here,

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the first time through the game,

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
it felt so right for this to have happened,

301
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,200
to be punished for trying to avoid making a hard decision,

302
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
that I pressed on to the end regardless.

303
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,500
The game's use of tons of different status effects

304
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,800
with their own particular challenges

305
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,700
is also really fun, by the way.

306
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
They can be devastating,

307
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,000
meaning the player has to work to deal with them

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
instead of trying to muscle through it

309
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
by being higher leveled

310
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,700
or dealing as much damage as they can

311
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
and hoping that's enough,

312
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
so fights become engaging questions

313
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
that demand an answer.

314
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,900
Do I do the most highly damaging attack,

315
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
or do I try and stun them or knock them down?

316
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,500
I played a lot of RPGs when I was a stupid kid

317
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
or still more as a stupid adult

318
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,400
without ever really bothering to deal with status effects,

319
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,100
using attacks that dealt the most damage

320
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
and maybe using health items or phoenix downs,

321
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,300
interacting less with the mechanics

322
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,000
and having less fun because the game

323
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,100
hadn't really made me, conditioning me

324
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,300
to play it in a less fun or interesting way.

325
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,700
Being made to plan around enemies

326
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
which deal interesting status effects

327
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
and learning to have to use your own effectively

328
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
because otherwise you'll die

329
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,300
makes this basically the best RPG experience

330
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,600
I've ever actually had.

331
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,700
The game teaches you the importance of statuses

332
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
in a really straightforward way.

333
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Your first party member, Terry Hintz,

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,700
is so poor at fighting that it's played for a joke.

335
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,100
This means one of the two moves you get every turn

336
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
at the start of the game is free to be wholly concerned

337
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,700
with using items and abilities that involve healing,

338
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,300
restoring TP and SP, or verbal bash

339
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,000
which can make enemies start crying and deal 50% damage

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,900
or get pissed and become far less likely to hit people

341
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,700
but also much more likely to hit for critical damage.

342
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, and sometimes they can also hit themselves

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,300
for massive damage too.

344
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,100
Terry Hintz might be genuinely one of the best pieces

345
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
of game design in the last 10 years.

346
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,800
Instead of, as in lots of RPGs,

347
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,300
handing you decent damage dealers

348
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,600
and then making the player only consider status effects

349
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,500
and healing when it's absolutely necessary

350
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,100
or when a designated healer class comes along,

351
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,000
the second half of your starting party

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,900
is functionally unable to hurt anyone

353
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
so you're handed an opportunity to figure out

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
how to make effective use of status effects

355
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
and items as early on as possible

356
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,700
and because of the game's difficulty,

357
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,500
if you don't, you're basically screwed

358
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
so you're forced to learn how to play

359
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
but in a subtle and suggestive way.

360
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,900
You can see that sort of consideration happening

361
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,600
in other aspects of design too.

362
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,500
One of the first key items to continue,

363
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,100
a child's bicycle because this game's great,

364
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
is only accessible through an enemy

365
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
that you'll need a full party

366
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
and a couple of firebombs to defeat.

367
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
Beating the boss means teaching you

368
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,800
the value of these items,

369
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,900
which makes scrounging for them

370
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
and holding onto them feel worth it

371
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
and deciding to use one in a fight

372
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
becomes a calculated risk

373
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
because you might have needed that later.

374
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,200
It makes managing to find some hidden

375
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,900
in the wild feel incredible

376
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,200
and, yes, it makes being forced to choose

377
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
between losing an arm and all of your things

378
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
into a genuinely nail-biting decision

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
because they're so goddamn useful.

380
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,300
I don't think I've ever felt so attached

381
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,600
to an expendable resource in a video game before.

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,100
This is, quite simply, genius.

383
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
And then when you do get the bike,

384
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,400
you'll notice that you can't move left with it

385
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
and drop off because your way is blocked

386
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,500
by this, uh, sports...board on a stick.

387
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
♪

388
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,600
You have to move right again.

389
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
Now, you probably already equipped it

390
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
because it's a new item,

391
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,800
so you pass into the other screen

392
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,700
and you naturally go too quick to see this gap

393
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,000
and you go over it thinking you'll drop down

394
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
but instead you hop over it

395
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,400
teaching you instantly what the bike does.

396
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
This little section,

397
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
this little section with this guy

398
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,200
and this bike is a very subtle tutorial

399
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
not just for how to use this item

400
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
but for the entire gameplay loop

401
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
that leads to getting it,

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
making careful use of items,

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
party members best serve using items

404
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
instead of attacking, building a party,

405
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,300
and gathering the resources to afford to build a party.

406
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
The game makes a joke about tutorials

407
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,200
having silly signs Terry left up

408
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,900
that teach basic stuff and mostly glorify Terry

409
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
but then it goes one further

410
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,600
and teaches you how to play it seemingly effortlessly.

411
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,900
Honestly, game designers like this

412
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
should be running our school system.

413
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,500
There's also almost no fluff to the game's mechanics.

414
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
The game's currency, dirty magazines,

415
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,900
hey, it's a world without women.

416
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,500
What else is gonna represent value?

417
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
is pretty rare.

418
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,300
There's not many to find in the world

419
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
or through side quests

420
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,100
and outside of a few specific areas,

421
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
there's no real way to grind them either.

422
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,700
There's a finite amount of people and mutants to fight

423
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,900
and almost all of them are unique characters

424
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
so since outside of grinding,

425
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,300
there's basically a precise amount of mags,

426
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,900
you can't buy everything you want

427
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,500
and don't have easy access to infinite healing items.

428
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,800
You have to ration them out,

429
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
make careful use of characters with heal abilities,

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,400
occasionally risk sleeping,

431
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,300
use the very limited firebomb resources in tougher fights,

432
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
and somehow in the middle of all this

433
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,900
afford to get new items and party members.

434
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,400
There's basically no free or simple choices in Lisa

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,900
and this makes almost every decision

436
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
in every encounter nail-biting.

437
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
It's very rare that games come along

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,600
that invoke this kind of anxiety in players.

439
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,500
Design-wise, Lisa equals XCOM or Darkest Dungeon

440
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,600
for its mechanical tightness and deadliness

441
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,200
and for its emotional tautness too.

442
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
It's also incredibly thematically interesting

443
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,700
to have so many things threatened

444
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,100
to get in the way of survival.

445
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,000
Characters being unable to perform at their best

446
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
because they're crying or drunk or hungover

447
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,900
or bleeding or depressed

448
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
or going through withdrawal symptoms

449
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,800
ties directly into the story of the game,

450
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,500
a story about characters whose judgment

451
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,400
is poorly compromised by trauma

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
or bad experiences or drug abuse.

453
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Taking a step forward always costs money or items

454
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,200
or often a character's life.

455
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
The Lisa games are all about this sense

456
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
of losing pieces of yourself to a traumatic world,

457
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
often literally,

458
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,600
and trying to escape the worst of its effects

459
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,100
to limited results.

460
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Some of the characters you fight

461
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,700
are quite clearly manifestations

462
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,600
of Brad's joy-altered psyche

463
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,300
giving life to his imagination.

464
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,000
The spiders you fight quite a lot in the painful

465
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,100
are very similar to the ones Lisa had to face

466
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
with the same man's face on them, no less.

467
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,100
In a setting like this one with a story like this one,

468
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,700
it makes sense to be confronted very often with scenarios

469
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,100
where everyone's just a little bit

470
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,400
too out of their right mind

471
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
to deal with what's happening to them.

472
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,300
Speaking of trauma,

473
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,100
the story of the painful is fascinating

474
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,200
in how it tackles similar ideas to the original

475
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,700
but in a more active way.

476
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,200
The first was a very internal conflict,

477
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,700
the main characters trying and failing

478
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,200
in their own imagination to escape an abusive life

479
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,900
and try to at least find some peace and calm

480
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
within themselves,

481
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,800
but instead they're repeatedly confronted

482
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,600
with their abuser and horrific manifestations of them

483
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
and what they inflicted on them.

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think the painful takes a more interesting

485
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
and considered road.

486
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
While you're trapped almost completely

487
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
in Brad's perception of his world,

488
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
his actions are real

489
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
and have consequences that affect others.

490
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
His choices in how he dealt with his trauma,

491
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,500
how he raised Buddy,

492
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
and how he reacts when she's taken,

493
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,600
these are all reactions to his experiences

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,100
and how they shaped his view of the world

495
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,200
and how to act in it.

496
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I've spoken about the game's difficult choices,

497
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,500
but what's equally informative

498
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,900
is the places where the game takes choice away from you

499
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,600
or presents you with false choices

500
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,800
or doesn't even point out the alternatives

501
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
that simply didn't occur to Brad

502
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,900
because of the person he's become,

503
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,600
not entirely of his own volition.

504
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,100
Brad blames himself for what happened to Lisa,

505
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
becomes a martial artist as a post-hoc self-defense mechanism

506
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,300
against the abuse he suffered,

507
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,700
and raises Buddy the best he can,

508
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,300
but the best he can is to shelter her

509
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,400
from a world of people that hurt him and his sister

510
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,500
when they were young.

511
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,200
This itself paves the way for Buddy

512
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,100
to become the person she ends up being.

513
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,700
When she's kidnapped from Brad's care,

514
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,400
or perhaps to put it a better way,

515
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,200
escapes from Brad's care,

516
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
Brad immediately takes this as a justification

517
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,200
for perhaps what he's been training for his entire life,

518
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
a rampage in which all he does

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,900
is try to protect someone he sees as vulnerable.

520
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,100
Many characters offer Brad other options

521
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,300
or question why he personally

522
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,100
should be the one deciding how to raise

523
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,600
or deal with the existence of the only girl left in the world,

524
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
and he doesn't even really consider these questions

525
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
because for him, the answer was obvious.

526
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,900
He pushes past these questions

527
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,400
all the way to what a game would normally position

528
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
as a heroic final stand

529
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
where he finally starts to quite literally transform

530
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,500
into a monster and enters a haze of violence

531
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,600
where the background is just a chaotic swirl of colors

532
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,500
and even an army of enemies are horrified.

533
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,800
Brad is unable to pursue other courses of action

534
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,300
because of who his experiences have made him into.

535
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,000
The joy that he's become addicted to

536
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,600
is described as making you feel nothing.

537
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
It's very clear why something like that

538
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
would become a crutch for someone who's lived Brad's life.

539
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
By doing this, the story positions

540
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,200
a lot of traditional heroism tropes

541
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
as the result of a warped perspective.

542
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,700
One of the last lines in the game

543
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
before the final battle starts is,

544
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,900
"'I've been dead for 35 years. Today I live.'"

545
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,800
This is the first time in most of Brad's life

546
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
that the world makes sense,

547
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,900
him against what he sees as an army of villains

548
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,600
preventing him from being a father.

549
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,900
It's the only narrative that makes sense to him,

550
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,300
and the game encourages the player

551
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,700
to think about what went wrong

552
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,900
and why he can't think about it.

553
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,300
There are also places where the player

554
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,600
is offered a direct choice,

555
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,400
such as fighting or sparing his father

556
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,100
once he finally encounters him again,

557
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,700
which is itself a false one.

558
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,100
While you can choose to try to spare him,

559
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Brad cannot resist himself.

560
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,500
This is an important creative choice,

561
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
or at least an honest one.

562
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,200
Everyone wants to believe

563
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,900
they're in full control of themselves,

564
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,200
but quite simply, sometimes we aren't.

565
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,800
Humans aren't rational actors.

566
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Brad's been fighting manifestations of this man

567
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,900
all his life already.

568
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
What's one more?

569
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,900
The Painful is, fittingly,

570
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,600
a game about pain.

571
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
It's about the suffering we can experience in our lives

572
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,100
and how it can stick with us whether we want it to or not

573
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,800
and influence us in ways we don't always want to see

574
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,700
and in turn go on to make us hurt others

575
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,500
even when we think what we're doing is right,

576
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,700
and the hurt we cause impacts them too.

577
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,500
It doesn't always offer an easy solution.

578
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,900
There's no magical pill that undoes childhood trauma

579
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,100
or allows complete control of one's actions.

580
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,400
It puts out the scary idea that none of us are free

581
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,300
because we're prisoners of the events and lives we've lived,

582
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,800
but there's a certain hopefulness to it too.

583
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,000
For all his mistakes and inabilities to make better choices

584
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
and drug or trauma-induced violence

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
he can't stop himself from committing,

586
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
there are still real choices to make,

587
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,000
and these choices still have meaning.

588
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,500
There are places where Brad is marginally making things better

589
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
for some people or at least tries to,

590
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
and there are often times when you can literally choose

591
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,400
to lose pieces of yourself to try and keep others alive.

592
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,700
These little choices are meaningful and valuable.

593
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,800
The game rightfully acknowledges this by having multiple endings.

594
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,500
If you manage to outside of cutscenes

595
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,800
never take the combat-enhancing but addictive item Joy,

596
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,700
an item designed to be used in harder fights

597
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,800
that's quite difficult to go without using,

598
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
the ending is very slightly different,

599
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,300
and if you manage to finish the game in pain mode

600
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
where everything is tougher and save points can only be used once,

601
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,700
the ending is again just a little bit different.

602
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,200
I think the point of these endings

603
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,400
is that things can be different, even a little, if we try,

604
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
and that makes trying worthwhile

605
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
even if it doesn't always amount to something.

606
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,300
The point isn't that Brad is a good person

607
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,500
but that he has the potential to do better,

608
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,600
as everyone does,

609
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,500
and start asking the right questions about himself,

610
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,000
and this is a hopeful thing.

611
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,100
The final choice in the game is buddies,

612
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,300
whether or not to hug Brad and empathize with him

613
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,800
in spite of the pain he's caused her

614
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,400
and the life she will live as a result of this.

615
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,600
This is a difficult choice

616
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,400
and arguably an ultimately meaningless one.

617
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,200
Do you hug a dying man or not?

618
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
It doesn't matter, but it's a real choice

619
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,100
in a world of many false ones.

620
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
Brad wasn't a good person,

621
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,100
but he didn't have as much of a say

622
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,800
in what kind of person he ended up being

623
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,900
as he'd have liked,

624
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,300
and the idea that things could maybe have turned out better

625
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,600
and helped him make better choices

626
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
is the real hope of the story.

627
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,200
It's a hard-won victory to tell a story

628
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
in which nothing good happens to anyone

629
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
and the character you play isn't a good person,

630
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,300
but you're left feeling like people still have the potential

631
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
to do better.

632
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
This is something the final game,

633
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,100
Lisa the Joyful,

634
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,000
does its best to call back into question

635
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
with somewhat mixed results.

636
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,600
Lisa the Joyful's first segments

637
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
are an excellent microcosm of the positives

638
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
and negatives of its overall story.

639
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,100
It opens incredibly strongly

640
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
with a revelation about what Buddy was learning

641
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,600
during the upbringing we only saw in fleeting glimpses

642
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
during the opening of the previous game.

643
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Buddy is forced by Brad to kill someone

644
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,200
in order to begin to learn how to defend herself.

645
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
This shows us how she was able to escape capture

646
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,000
so easily in the previous games

647
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,800
and lets us a little into how she'll have come to see the world

648
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
and, of course, showcases Brad's own views

649
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,700
about that world in detail, too.

650
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
I always wondered who killed this guy on the counter here,

651
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,900
and the answer is probably Buddy.

652
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
♪♪

653
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
♪♪

654
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
But then, after a cool cut to the title,

655
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
it cuts to black,

656
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,000
and we get some regular expository dialogue

657
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
about what two characters were yet to really learn about are up to,

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
implying various things about character relationships

659
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,700
and the reasons why the world is the way it is.

660
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,400
We then cut to immediately after the ending of the previous game

661
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
where things continue in Media Res.

662
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
These twin openings are an indicator

663
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
of the two roles the Joyful has to fill.

664
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,500
The Joyful was a stretch goal for the Kickstarter for the Painful,

665
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,700
the mission statement being that you'll play as Buddy

666
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,500
and uncover the truth behind the world of Lisa,

667
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,400
but it turns out those are very separate things entirely

668
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,900
and actually quite jarring when done together.

669
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,400
The world of Lisa is interesting and mysterious,

670
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
but part of what made it those things

671
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
was that you were exploring it as a byproduct

672
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,700
of a much more personal story

673
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,200
where the apocalypse was just a way of putting these characters

674
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,100
into more extreme circumstances.

675
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,900
Exploring it in more detail or explaining it outright

676
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,500
would have detracted from the engaging personal story,

677
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,000
taken time away from it,

678
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
and, well, it would have ruined the mystery.

679
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You can carve a really sharp divide

680
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,800
between the parts that are about kinda just expositing

681
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,900
what happened in the past involving Lisa

682
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,600
or implying what happened to the world and who's behind it

683
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
and retroactively explaining the events of the previous game

684
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,100
and the parts that make up this really interesting story

685
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,400
about the last girl in a world full of monsters

686
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,900
trying to become its new ruler

687
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,600
by crossing every other warlord off a giant list

688
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,100
and becoming a little bit of a monster herself on the way.

689
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,100
The latter is really new and unique and interesting

690
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,800
while building on the themes and story we already know,

691
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
but the former is unnecessary and explains things

692
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,600
that don't need explaining

693
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,900
because they're not really what the story was about.

694
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,400
This doesn't just mean half the story

695
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,700
isn't as good as it could be.

696
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,100
It also drags focus away from Buddy's story

697
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,900
and weakens that half a little too.

698
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,300
It's not the worst thing in the world,

699
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,700
but I think more focus on Buddy and her choices

700
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,500
would have resulted in a much more engaging

701
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
and tighter story overall.

702
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
That said, the story that is there for Buddy

703
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,300
is honestly great.

704
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,600
Where Brad decided that for the safety of himself

705
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
and his loved ones, he had to close his problems off

706
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
from the world and hide from the people who threatened them,

707
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,900
hoping to keep them a secret forever,

708
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,000
Buddy learned the exact opposite lesson

709
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and concluded that the only way to be safe

710
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,900
was to kill everyone who could possibly pose a threat

711
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,100
and take control.

712
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,700
She's literally crossing names off a list

713
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,500
and slowly imagining more and more violence around her

714
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
as she does so.

715
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,300
The fun thing about stories with parental dynamics like this,

716
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,600
similar to some chapters of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

717
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,500
is through one character's behavior,

718
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
you simultaneously get to learn about that character

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,100
and the people who made them that way.

720
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,600
A good deal of Buddy's behavior reflects back onto Brad

721
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
and the lessons she'd have learned

722
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
either through his direct teachings

723
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,300
or through having to live with someone like him.

724
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,000
You're still learning about precisely what happened to Lisa

725
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,300
and what she did about it through how Brad and Buddy act,

726
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,600
and that's fascinating.

727
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,800
The massive cast of party members from the Painful

728
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
is not a feature here.

729
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
You just get Buddy and temporarily Rando

730
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,100
while Buddy levels up and the player gets the hang

731
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
of her new gameplay style.

732
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,900
While I said having lots of characters

733
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,600
that you could choose from and risk losing was cool,

734
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,100
having less characters isn't specifically a bad thing.

735
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Instead, the focus is on having one character

736
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,800
whose moves are more mechanically dense

737
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
than any individual character previously,

738
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,100
giving her both the ability to induce numerous status effects

739
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
like Flustered, Sleep, Bleed, and Poison

740
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,500
and a slew of generally good attacks, too.

741
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,700
Buddy's stronger attacks have a timing minigame

742
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,000
which can be quite tough to master

743
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,300
but are highly necessary for persevering.

744
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,300
Joy makes a return and the game's hallucinatory tutorials

745
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,600
from Buddy's psyche even quite strongly advise you to use it.

746
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
Apparently, the use joy messages were added in a patch

747
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
when players had trouble proceeding without it,

748
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,900
committed to not using joy the way many did in the Painful

749
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,100
because they knew there was an ending

750
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
specifically for not using it.

751
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,100
There is no such ending here,

752
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,400
meaning the joy mechanic can be properly used

753
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,600
by folks who skipped out on it before like me.

754
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,500
The story isn't the only thing that's divided.

755
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,700
The gameplay and story suffer from a much sharper divide, too.

756
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,400
Where the previous game had the almost magical interaction

757
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,100
between story choices and their gameplay consequences,

758
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,200
no such choices pop up for Buddy.

759
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,700
There are a couple of moments where you're given

760
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,100
the sort of typical moral choice of little consequence

761
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,700
you would see in inferior RPGs

762
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,100
like deciding whether or not to drop Rando into the pit

763
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,400
or whether or not to attack the pacifists.

764
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
It's a bit disappointing.

765
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Worse, with the Rando choice,

766
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,600
it doesn't matter which choice you make.

767
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,500
It results in slightly different exposition

768
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,100
and maybe lets you skip a fight,

769
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,000
but the same things play out no matter what

770
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
with no further impact on story or gameplay.

771
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,700
But with the pacifists, there's this chilling aspect

772
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,100
showing how far Buddy has gone

773
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,700
where you can't even talk to them

774
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,100
and attempting to or even walking past them

775
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
asks you once again if you want to fight them or not.

776
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,400
Every few steps, Buddy has to actively choose not to murder,

777
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,100
which, of course, is the highlighted option

778
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,800
like it's her first instinct.

779
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,000
You're never given any really difficult choices.

780
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
You never have to risk losing any useful items.

781
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,400
In fact, there aren't really any of the rarer items

782
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
from the painful that would relieve harmful effects

783
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,700
in a pinch like the poison-curing cigarettes

784
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,500
you find, like, six of in the whole game

785
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,000
because lots of the tougher effects

786
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,900
have been taken out entirely to support a game

787
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,700
with largely only one character.

788
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,000
There's basically no point to the shopkeeper at all

789
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
and the main path through the game

790
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
gives you an abundance of joy,

791
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
so item management is basically gone

792
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,000
and all the party member reviving perfume you get

793
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
only matters for a very short period anyway

794
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,800
because you're on your own.

795
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
This ruins what could have been

796
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,300
a much more delicate balance of items.

797
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,100
Honestly, my expectations for the joyful

798
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,900
in the first hour were super high.

799
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,400
I was imagining all the different ways

800
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,900
a version of this battle system

801
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,500
but mechanically based around having

802
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,100
just one character could work.

803
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,700
Status effects, item management,

804
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,600
TP management, learning the timing

805
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
of the better attacks, making the best use

806
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
of your one turn per round in a fight

807
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,300
could become scalpel-sharp concentrations

808
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,200
of important choices and a robust inventory system

809
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
where defense and armor have to be balanced

810
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,700
against resistance or speed

811
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,600
or trying not to get stunned or tripped or poisoned.

812
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,900
This could have made for a really

813
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,500
mechanically dense game.

814
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,600
I was fully prepared to say that the joyful

815
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
had the best gameplay of the three games,

816
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,900
and while this theoretical version of Lisa

817
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
does almost rear its head in a few

818
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
of the tougher fights against larger groups

819
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,800
or if you commit to not taking Joy,

820
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,100
it never really feels like you're being challenged

821
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,900
in any way other than nailing the timing

822
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,500
on Buddy's more damaging attacks.

823
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,100
I think the gameplay is still overall

824
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,700
very fun and really challenging,

825
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
but the awareness of how much better

826
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,000
this approach could have been

827
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,300
makes it feel like a missed opportunity at times.

828
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,500
One of the best and sadly only examples

829
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
of gameplay and story overlapping

830
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,100
is that your other party member Rando's attacks

831
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,800
are also called Armstrong-style

832
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,600
because Brad trained him as a kid.

833
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
That's just really cute.

834
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
The soundtrack, in addition to containing

835
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,300
even more heavily distorted and speed-shifted versions

836
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,400
of previous tracks, has a bunch of new ones

837
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
with an increased reliance on samples

838
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,700
including new instruments, vocals, and even air horns.

839
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,800
I remember putting a playlist of Lisa music

840
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,000
on at a friend's house, and once it transitioned

841
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
into tracks from the joyful, he made me stop.

842
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
I really like the music,

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,700
not just because I have horrible taste,

844
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,500
but because its use in the game is perfect.

845
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,200
Tracks like the almost abominable

846
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,500
666 Kill Chop Deluxe play during tougher boss fights,

847
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
and it's not just fitting but complementary

848
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,700
to the sense of being trapped in the hellish storm

849
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,500
of drug-infused violence Buddy has become.

850
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,300
This soundtrack is the most complementary to a game

851
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,000
since Fallout New Vegas or even Planescape Torment.

852
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,400
There's something to be said about the engagement

853
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,700
I felt with the joyful.

854
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,100
In Painful, my first time through,

855
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,200
I was almost afraid to open it back up again

856
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,400
and see how much worse things could get for Brad,

857
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,200
find out who in my party I'd become attached to

858
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,800
I'd lose trying to find Buddy.

859
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Joyful, fittingly for its title,

860
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,800
makes you feel like you have nothing to lose.

861
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,300
I took a break partway through Joyful

862
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,400
and couldn't wait to open it back up and finish it

863
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,300
and continue crossing names off the list.

864
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,900
There's something incredibly appealing

865
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,000
about Buddy's journey in spite of everything negative

866
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
I've said about the story.

867
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Spoilers for the plot in case you somehow made it

868
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,200
this far without playing.

869
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,300
Eventually, Buddy kills everyone on the list,

870
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,000
but then because the ending needs to explain

871
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,300
the universe of Lisa,

872
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,500
what follows is almost completely unrelated.

873
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,900
Buddy suddenly meets the man who's behind everything.

874
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
We get some exposition, a fairly easy fight,

875
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
a few genuinely fantastic character-exploring

876
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,300
hallucinations for a bit in the middle.

877
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,800
Bozo explains the plot you and Buddy

878
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,400
didn't really need to know about,

879
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,200
and then Buddy gets to choose whether to mutate like Brad

880
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,400
or cure herself using the Joy vaccine

881
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,600
we just learned about

882
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,900
and raise the next generation of humankind.

883
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,400
This ending really kind of disappointed me.

884
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,500
Like, mutating into a monster has so far been a metaphor

885
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,800
for being taken over by your worst instincts.

886
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
The transformation is fueled by joy,

887
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,900
but wanting joy is fueled by having something

888
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,600
eating you up inside until the joy ate you up

889
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,300
and turned you into a monstrous expression

890
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
of those feelings, for example,

891
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,400
turning Brad into a monster obsessed with protecting Lisa

892
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,900
and Buddy by proxy.

893
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,800
I wrote the part of the script covering the painful

894
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,400
a year ago before I finally decided to play Joyful,

895
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
and what I liked about the problems

896
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
that appeared in that game is that they're not something

897
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,400
you can choose to walk away from.

898
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
You take those parts of you everywhere,

899
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and you can't just erase them from yourself.

900
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,600
I literally wrote that there is no magic cure,

901
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
so having the game end with Buddy able to quickly

902
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,500
and easily choose to get over the traumatic life

903
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,200
that led her to be the person she is

904
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
instead of having to learn to deal with it

905
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,100
in the sort of personal human way

906
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,000
I'd come to expect from the series

907
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
was really jarring to me.

908
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,800
The skeleton of a really good story is still here,

909
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,100
but it's obscured by having to be all the other things

910
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,200
that it had to be,

911
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
and this really deprives us of the chance

912
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
to really explore Buddy and her choices

913
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
and how she would even go about moving on from all this,

914
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,500
but at the same time, I'm really touched

915
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,400
that this series about sadness and tragedy and decline

916
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,700
ends with a victim of abuse achieving what amounts

917
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,500
to some sense of closure or even a happy ending

918
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,000
and, earned or not, getting to put aside

919
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
their sadness and depression and self-loathing

920
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
and escape into the possibilities of the future.

921
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,700
I think it could have been done a lot better,

922
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,200
but I really, really like what it did.

923
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,400
In a way, playing this game as someone

924
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
who thinks a lot about design

925
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,300
and occasionally tries to make games of their own,

926
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,500
there's something inspirational about it,

927
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,700
like, the theoretical really good game

928
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,800
I wanted it to be doesn't exist now,

929
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,600
which means someone else gets to make that one.

930
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
That someone else could even be you,

931
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,700
and I think the truly fascinating power

932
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,100
about really good games is they leave people

933
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,600
with ideas about what they could do next.

934
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,000
They spread the ideas and concepts further

935
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,900
by being so good even if sometimes

936
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
they leave you wanting

937
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,200
or perhaps even by leaving you wanting.

938
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,700
Lisa owes a debt of sorts to both Yume Nikki and EarthBound,

939
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
which, of course, has inspired lots of other games,

940
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,900
including Undertale,

941
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,000
itself made by someone who also started out

942
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,300
making what amounts to an EarthBound fangame.

943
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,600
Some games are just excellent at spawning

944
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,100
this desire to add to them,

945
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,900
to create something using the ideas it leaves with you,

946
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,200
and, fantastically, Lisa is doing just that.

947
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,400
There's already at least two really fleshed-out Lisa fangames,

948
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Lisa the Hopeful and Lisa the Pointless,

949
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,700
and who knows what great designers in the future

950
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,500
might say Lisa was the inspiration for their own projects.

951
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,800
In my opinion, Lisa is already doomed

952
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,600
to enter the stream of history.

953
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I guarantee you 100%,

954
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,900
one of the future best games ever made,

955
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,000
one of the next indie mega-hits on Steam

956
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,500
or whatever platform will make it into the next decade

957
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,800
will be made by someone upon whom this game has left its mark.

958
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,100
It's kind of funny.

959
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,200
The games are all about trying to get over something,

960
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
move on from it, forget about it,

961
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,600
but we're going to see Lisa again one day

962
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,000
in a new form we might not even recognize,

963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,500
and, personally, I can't wait.

This thing has been a really long time coming,

and I know I didn't make many jokes this time,

968
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,100

Please let me know what you thought of this one in the comments.
