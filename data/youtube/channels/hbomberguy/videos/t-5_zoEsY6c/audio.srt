1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Austin Jorgensen's series Lisa is one of those cult hits,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,900
the kind where it's quite genuinely formed a cult of people who are really into it,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,600
but not many people outside the in-group really know that much about it.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,100
This is probably because it's hard to talk about.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,900
It's got a lot of really funny moments,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,900
some excellent examples of great writing or perfect comedic timing,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,700
but unlike, for example, Undertale,

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,800
the story's content has some pretty gruesome and uncomfortable material.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,400
It enters into an artistic territory where you'd need to know someone pretty well

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
to feel okay recommending it to them.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
It explores themes that can be quite difficult to talk about

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,700
and which plenty of people quite justifiably don't want to,

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,100
and the game is too good at focusing on what it wants to be about

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,900
that you can't ignore it and just focus on something else.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,500
There's a process in modern game discourse I like to call memification.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,300
To be a little bit cynical, if you wanted to for easy clicks,

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,300
there are some games you can invent reasons to talk about if you need to.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,900
The game's story and themes are loose and friendly and open enough

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,500
that you can reapply the critical lens over and over

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,300
and always have a new, somewhat facile element to explore for an audience.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,700
You can speculate for all time about some games

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,100
if they have certain features that make it easy to do so.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,800
You could even do a needlessly in-depth analysis

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,500
of one character's relationship with anime.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
No way, that one was mine, wasn't it?

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
But when someone like that attempts to play Lisa,

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,100
a game whose themes are unavoidable and specific and beautiful and horrific and sad,

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,900
the best one could say is,

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,800
this reminds me of Undertale.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,600
The only way to relate the experience through such a critically dysfunctional perspective

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,700
is by using the lens of one of the two or three games you can talk about endlessly

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,500
before going back to talking about them endlessly.

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,900
Also, um, Lisa came out quite a bit before Undertale.

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
Just saying, man.

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,600
This is not a criticism of Undertale or the pretend-to-think-about-games economy,

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
although I guess on some level it kind of is both of those.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Rather, I'm laboring to point out that Lisa doesn't get talked about too much

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,500
because by its nature, the reasons why it's good can be hard to talk about.

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,700
With that in mind, I'm going to talk about it here

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,600
and spoil aspects of the plots of all three of the games

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,800
while not specifically summarizing them in explicit detail.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,700
I would highly recommend pausing the video here and playing the games for yourself.

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
They're all either cheap or free,

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,100
so there isn't much of an excuse not to,

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,000
and I don't want to preemptively ruin your experience.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
See you in, I don't know, 20 hours?

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,900
â™ªâ™ª

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,800
Most people probably at least vaguely know of Yume Nikki or Dream Diary,

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,400
a free game made in an early version of RPG Maker

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
in which you control a girl named Madotsuki who refuses to leave her room.

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Instead, she can go to bed and enter her dreams.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,100
The game is light on plot,

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,700
instead relying on exploration and curiosity about the dream worlds you visit and how they work.

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,000
You can collect items which have some uses,

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,100
but I wouldn't really say the game has puzzles, per se.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,500
It functions more as a dream itself, floating from area to area

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,700
as interesting and sometimes random events happen at you.

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,500
The game's well-known largely because of some of these events,

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,700
like when hitting a light switch sometimes makes this face appear.

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,400
â™ªâ™ª

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,800
This face probably made Yume Nikki popular,

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,500
and this has a 1 in 64 chance of even happening.

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I, uh, actually had to steal this footage.

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
While the game doesn't really have a plot,

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,400
it has buckets of story if you feel like interpreting the ideas it throws at you.

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
Consistent imagery of car crash victims,

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,900
grasping hands, staring eyes, being chased,

68
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,100
the sudden outbursts of quite scary visuals and music.

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,000
The reasons Madotsuki doesn't want to go out into the world for real

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
are made astonishingly clear in her dreams.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
The game is, really, an exploration of one character's psyche

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,700
and what they think about in their most unguarded moments.

73
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,100
People think they can escape into their dreams,

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
but you bring your mind with you,

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,700
and if the thing you're trying to escape from had such a big impact on you,

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,400
you're not getting away so easily.

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,600
While the game is often praised for being weird or random,

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Yume Nikki has a good deal of clarity of purpose

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
and probably resonates with people

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,300
because the experiences and ideas it explores are almost universal.

81
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,400
Almost everyone knows something bad could happen to them if they went outside,

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,700
so playing to the paranoia that can come from that

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,900
reaches a lot of people in parts of themselves

84
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,400
they don't often realize are there.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,500
Yume Nikki was pretty impactful for a free RPG Maker game.

86
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,400
There's several fan games and even more original but overtly inspired works,

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,400
and one of them is Lisa, now called Lisa the First.

88
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Lisa is a story about a girl trapped in an abusive home trying to imagine her escape,

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,500
but even in her own imagination, her experiences follow her everywhere.

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,600
The similarities are already clear, but the differences are interesting.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Trying to find an escape does involve collecting and using various items to progress,

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
which is a little more direct than how Yume Nikki does it,

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
but the themes are also much more direct,

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
making them somewhat more impactful.

95
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
Almost every character is portrayed by Lisa's abusive father,

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,000
and trying to play to the bizarre whims of this rather singular cast

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
is in its own way kind of depressing and scary.

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,800
I'd recommend people play as much of the game as they can

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,900
until they find a puzzle they don't know how to solve

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,900
or get sick of dying to the spiders with the father's face on them

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,800
and then watch a playthrough of someone who knows what they're doing on YouTube.

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,500
It doesn't really hold up as a game,

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,000
but as a story, as an exploration of a mind, as an atmosphere,

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
it's emotionally quite an experience.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,900
An idea that starts here and prevails throughout the series

106
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,400
and is one of its best features is the reuse of music from previous areas,

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
but at different speeds.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
These stories put you in the mind of characters

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
whose psyche is damaged by their experiences,

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
and having even the music second-guess your memory of how it sounds

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
is really disconcerting.

112
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,100
It's cool getting the opportunity to see a work

113
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,200
very openly inspired by something else,

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,900
but also full of elements unique to itself.

115
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,400
Or should I say you-may-neek to itself?

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
What am I talking about?

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,600
The ending terminates disturbingly with this game over screen,

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,100
and this is actually the last we ever physically see of Lisa

119
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
in a series named for her,

120
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
though characters have visions of her everywhere

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,400
and her presence looms large in the rest of the story.

122
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,300
â™ª

123
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,400
Lisa, the Painful, also made in a version of RPG Maker,

124
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
has a very different approach entirely to storytelling

125
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,700
and more traditional RPG elements,

126
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,500
and what's surprising about it is that this doesn't distract

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
from giving the player an emotional through-line.

128
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,300
RPGs have a tendency to sharply divide their gameplay and story.

129
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
You level your characters and gather equipment and items and fight

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,300
and then reach the next story beat in the form of a cutscene.

131
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,000
Quite often you see fans of the expansive scope and story of RPGs,

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,800
but who aren't hugely into the parts where they have to battle monsters

133
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
or level grind between those bits,

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,100
or the opposite where they might even skip the story

135
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,000
to get to the part that engages them better,

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,300
the actual gameplay.

137
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,200
If you like both, you kind of have to like them separately

138
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
on different levels from one another

139
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
because they're ultimately very disparate aspects of the game.

140
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,600
The Painful's greatest quality is that it does everything it can

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
to be a synthesis of both of these elements,

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,700
making them complement each other so directly

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,100
that you can no longer really delineate them at all.

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
All the most involving story moments

145
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
also have direct importance on gameplay.

146
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,800
Losing all your characters or a party member

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
or having to play Russian roulette

148
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,900
and risk literally losing characters

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,900
to random chance to continue can be devastating

150
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,600
in the same way that in several battles

151
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,900
it's possible for a character to straight-up get killed

152
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
instead of KO'd.

153
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,800
â™ª

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,200
â™ª

155
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,300
By inflicting all the deaths and loss of the story

156
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,600
on the player mechanically,

157
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,200
by genuinely taking away everything they'd found

158
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
or characters they play with,

159
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
they're forcing the player to experience

160
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,100
the story aspects of the game on a direct level.

161
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,400
When something bad happens,

162
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,600
it's not just bad because you theoretically care

163
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
about these characters.

164
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,200
It's bad because you need those people

165
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,900
and you want those things.

166
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,600
Stop taking my things!

167
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,100
Speaking of things, those things are important.

168
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,400
Take, for example, firebombs.

169
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,500
They do a ton of damage

170
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,400
and inflict the fire effect on your enemies

171
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,300
and are very useful in boss battles

172
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,500
or with bigger fights against larger groups

173
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,900
or if you've already lost a lot of party members.

174
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,000
You might actually genuinely need the items you can find

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
as opposed to a lot of RPGs

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
where most of the stuff feels optional

177
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
or just, like, another potion or something.

178
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
This causes the player to invest more

179
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
in trying to find these things

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
which makes the game more engaging

181
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,700
and very effectively puts you into the role

182
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,900
of someone scavenging a broken wasteland

183
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,300
for anything of value.

184
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,900
I made a video last year exploring ludonarrative,

185
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,100
the idea that while games can have stories,

186
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,400
the actual story was the player's experience

187
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,300
of the game itself through its mechanics

188
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,500
and really engaging games forge an emotional perspective

189
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,600
for the player to occupy

190
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
through good execution of those mechanics

191
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,100
and Lisa might be the best game I've ever seen at this.

192
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,600
It's one of few games where I've had a bad outcome,

193
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
lost someone permanently in a hard fight

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,900
a long way off from my last save

195
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,700
or almost all of my party to Russian roulette

196
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,900
and continued because I'd come so far

197
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,600
and didn't want to have to go all the way back

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
or worse off, had no idea how much worse it would be

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
if I tried again.

200
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,000
I save scum like a madman in games when I can,

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,800
like I have a folder on my hard drive

202
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
full of Darkest Dungeon and XCOM saves just in case

203
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
but Lisa makes pressing on despite what comes by you

204
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
feel like the right thing to do

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,000
and always makes it inconvenient enough

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that the alternative, loading a save,

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,700
feels like a punishment itself that you want to avoid.

208
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
You have to press on because the last save point

209
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,800
was way back there

210
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,500
and who knows how many people you'll lose next time.

211
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,200
There are several points where the player is told

212
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
to make a choice between losing everything they have

213
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,900
or a person's life or one of Brad's arms.

214
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,600
These choices aren't reversible and can't be worked around.

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
Losing one or both arms permanently alters

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
the mechanics and abilities of the one party member

217
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
you'll always have,

218
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
losing a party member whose abilities

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
you probably need to survive,

220
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
losing all the firebombs and equipment

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,300
keeping you alive.

222
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,100
These are all choices that are difficult

223
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,900
and each genuinely make the game harder.

224
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,400
You actually want, because of the game's mechanics,

225
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,200
to keep all of these people

226
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,700
because they're relevant not to the game's story

227
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,200
but to your ability to get through the game

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
and this means being forced to choose

229
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,500
is more painful than most other decisions in video games.

230
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
If these characters were just other characters

231
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,000
in the story that was also happening

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
while I was playing an unrelated RPG in fights,

233
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,100
this wouldn't have mattered at all,

234
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
but when someone threatens Terry,

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,700
your best friend, more on Terry later,

236
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
that means something.

237
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
These characters have mechanical value to the player

238
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
who might well have come to rely on them in fights.

239
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Fascinatingly, most of the characters in your party

240
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
in Lisa don't matter to the main story whatsoever,

241
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
but I cared more about their survival

242
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,500
because they were important to me.

243
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Having to choose to go without items to keep them

244
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
or learn to press on without them

245
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,200
because losing all your healing items

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,500
and money and firebombs just isn't manageable

247
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,100
is a real choice that you have to account for.

248
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,900
I can imagine having characters or items taken away

249
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
being frustrating for some players,

250
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,400
but it's absolutely fitting to this one story

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,700
and I do think that frustration is itself compelling.

252
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
The same way that having to send Simpsons hentai

253
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
to the brothel to keep them from losing their mind

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
completely was in Darkest Dungeon.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
There's also a lot of random events

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
that trigger when you sleep to recover your health,

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,900
events like losing party members

258
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,000
and having to get them back

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
or everyone getting badly poisoned

260
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
or just stuff getting stolen.

261
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
These sorts of things create a quite genuine paranoia

262
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
in the player because, again, you want all that stuff.

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
You learn to only take the risk when you really need to,

264
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,300
and this paranoia puts you into the same sort of mindset

265
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
as Brad who sees Lisa everywhere,

266
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
looking down and judging him.

267
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,200
This, again, builds on a mechanic from Yume Nikki.

268
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Random events happened in that game,

269
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,700
but they didn't affect the gameplay all that much

270
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
and they didn't even really affect the story

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
unless you're a pretentious weirdo

272
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,700
who likes to read into things.

273
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,200
Lisa builds a universe where you can randomly lose

274
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,500
someone important to you and that's scary and threatening

275
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,000
and makes you afraid to go to sleep in the game,

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
and while that's not technically a fair mechanic,

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,500
it's a powerful mechanic

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
and that's actually more important

279
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,200
than the game being balanced or fair.

280
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
The gameplay and story exist to get across the same ideas

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
and do it by affecting each other

282
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,900
in much more direct ways than most RPGs.

283
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
There's even a section where,

284
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,200
upon being told to choose between losing

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
what will probably be at that point your second arm

286
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,600
or losing all your items,

287
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
you have the third option of asking the character

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
why they're doing this to you,

289
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
and while you're briefly offered the chance

290
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,000
of seeing past this facade,

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,800
he then takes both your arm and all your items

292
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
as a seemingly purposeful attack on games

293
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,300
that offer easy ways out,

294
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,400
where you can sweet-talk your way past a choice

295
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,500
that it should have been hard.

296
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,100
The player is punished for believing

297
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,400
it would be so simple.

298
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,000
While it would have been easy to load a save here,

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the first time through the game,

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
it felt so right for this to have happened,

301
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,200
to be punished for trying to avoid making a hard decision,

302
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
that I pressed on to the end regardless.

303
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,500
The game's use of tons of different status effects

304
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,800
with their own particular challenges

305
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,700
is also really fun, by the way.

306
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
They can be devastating,

307
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,000
meaning the player has to work to deal with them

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
instead of trying to muscle through it

309
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
by being higher leveled

310
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,700
or dealing as much damage as they can

311
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
and hoping that's enough,

312
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
so fights become engaging questions

313
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
that demand an answer.

314
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,900
Do I do the most highly damaging attack,

315
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
or do I try and stun them or knock them down?

316
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,500
I played a lot of RPGs when I was a stupid kid

317
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
or still more as a stupid adult

318
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,400
without ever really bothering to deal with status effects,

319
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,100
using attacks that dealt the most damage

320
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
and maybe using health items or phoenix downs,

321
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,300
interacting less with the mechanics

322
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,000
and having less fun because the game

323
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,100
hadn't really made me, conditioning me

324
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,300
to play it in a less fun or interesting way.

325
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,700
Being made to plan around enemies

326
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
which deal interesting status effects

327
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
and learning to have to use your own effectively

328
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
because otherwise you'll die

329
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,300
makes this basically the best RPG experience

330
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,600
I've ever actually had.

331
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,700
The game teaches you the importance of statuses

332
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
in a really straightforward way.

333
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Your first party member, Terry Hintz,

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,700
is so poor at fighting that it's played for a joke.

335
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,100
This means one of the two moves you get every turn

336
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
at the start of the game is free to be wholly concerned

337
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,700
with using items and abilities that involve healing,

338
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,300
restoring TP and SP, or verbal bash

339
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,000
which can make enemies start crying and deal 50% damage

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,900
or get pissed and become far less likely to hit people

341
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,700
but also much more likely to hit for critical damage.

342
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, and sometimes they can also hit themselves

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,300
for massive damage too.

344
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,100
Terry Hintz might be genuinely one of the best pieces

345
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
of game design in the last 10 years.

346
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,800
Instead of, as in lots of RPGs,

347
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,300
handing you decent damage dealers

348
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,600
and then making the player only consider status effects

349
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,500
and healing when it's absolutely necessary

350
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,100
or when a designated healer class comes along,

351
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,000
the second half of your starting party

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,900
is functionally unable to hurt anyone

353
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
so you're handed an opportunity to figure out

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
how to make effective use of status effects

355
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
and items as early on as possible

356
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,700
and because of the game's difficulty,

357
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,500
if you don't, you're basically screwed

358
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
so you're forced to learn how to play

359
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
but in a subtle and suggestive way.

360
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,900
You can see that sort of consideration happening

361
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,600
in other aspects of design too.

362
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,500
One of the first key items to continue,

363
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,100
a child's bicycle because this game's great,

364
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
is only accessible through an enemy

365
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
that you'll need a full party

366
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
and a couple of firebombs to defeat.

367
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
Beating the boss means teaching you

368
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,800
the value of these items,

369
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,900
which makes scrounging for them

370
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
and holding onto them feel worth it

371
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
and deciding to use one in a fight

372
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
becomes a calculated risk

373
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
because you might have needed that later.

374
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,200
It makes managing to find some hidden

375
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,900
in the wild feel incredible

376
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,200
and, yes, it makes being forced to choose

377
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
between losing an arm and all of your things

378
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
into a genuinely nail-biting decision

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
because they're so goddamn useful.

380
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,300
I don't think I've ever felt so attached

381
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,600
to an expendable resource in a video game before.

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,100
This is, quite simply, genius.

383
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
And then when you do get the bike,

384
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,400
you'll notice that you can't move left with it

385
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
and drop off because your way is blocked

386
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,500
by this, uh, sports...board on a stick.

387
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
â™ª

388
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,600
You have to move right again.

389
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
Now, you probably already equipped it

390
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
because it's a new item,

391
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,800
so you pass into the other screen

392
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,700
and you naturally go too quick to see this gap

393
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,000
and you go over it thinking you'll drop down

394
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
but instead you hop over it

395
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,400
teaching you instantly what the bike does.

396
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
This little section,

397
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
this little section with this guy

398
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,200
and this bike is a very subtle tutorial

399
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
not just for how to use this item

400
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
but for the entire gameplay loop

401
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
that leads to getting it,

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
making careful use of items,

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
party members best serve using items

404
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
instead of attacking, building a party,

405
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,300
and gathering the resources to afford to build a party.

406
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
The game makes a joke about tutorials

407
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,200
having silly signs Terry left up

408
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,900
that teach basic stuff and mostly glorify Terry

409
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
but then it goes one further

410
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,600
and teaches you how to play it seemingly effortlessly.

411
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,900
Honestly, game designers like this

412
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
should be running our school system.

413
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,500
There's also almost no fluff to the game's mechanics.

414
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
The game's currency, dirty magazines,

415
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,900
hey, it's a world without women.

416
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,500
What else is gonna represent value?

417
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
is pretty rare.

418
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,300
There's not many to find in the world

419
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
or through side quests

420
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,100
and outside of a few specific areas,

421
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
there's no real way to grind them either.

422
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,700
There's a finite amount of people and mutants to fight

423
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,900
and almost all of them are unique characters

424
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
so since outside of grinding,

425
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,300
there's basically a precise amount of mags,

426
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,900
you can't buy everything you want

427
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,500
and don't have easy access to infinite healing items.

428
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,800
You have to ration them out,

429
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
make careful use of characters with heal abilities,

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,400
occasionally risk sleeping,

431
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,300
use the very limited firebomb resources in tougher fights,

432
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
and somehow in the middle of all this

433
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,900
afford to get new items and party members.

434
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,400
There's basically no free or simple choices in Lisa

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,900
and this makes almost every decision

436
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
in every encounter nail-biting.

437
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
It's very rare that games come along

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,600
that invoke this kind of anxiety in players.

439
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,500
Design-wise, Lisa equals XCOM or Darkest Dungeon

440
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,600
for its mechanical tightness and deadliness

441
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,200
and for its emotional tautness too.

442
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
It's also incredibly thematically interesting

443
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,700
to have so many things threatened

444
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,100
to get in the way of survival.

445
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,000
Characters being unable to perform at their best

446
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
because they're crying or drunk or hungover

447
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,900
or bleeding or depressed

448
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
or going through withdrawal symptoms

449
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,800
ties directly into the story of the game,

450
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,500
a story about characters whose judgment

451
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,400
is poorly compromised by trauma

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
or bad experiences or drug abuse.

453
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Taking a step forward always costs money or items

454
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,200
or often a character's life.

455
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
The Lisa games are all about this sense

456
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
of losing pieces of yourself to a traumatic world,

457
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
often literally,

458
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,600
and trying to escape the worst of its effects

459
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,100
to limited results.

460
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Some of the characters you fight

461
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,700
are quite clearly manifestations

462
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,600
of Brad's joy-altered psyche

463
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,300
giving life to his imagination.

464
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,000
The spiders you fight quite a lot in the painful

465
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,100
are very similar to the ones Lisa had to face

466
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
with the same man's face on them, no less.

467
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,100
In a setting like this one with a story like this one,

468
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,700
it makes sense to be confronted very often with scenarios

469
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,100
where everyone's just a little bit

470
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,400
too out of their right mind

471
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
to deal with what's happening to them.

472
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,300
Speaking of trauma,

473
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,100
the story of the painful is fascinating

474
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,200
in how it tackles similar ideas to the original

475
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,700
but in a more active way.

476
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,200
The first was a very internal conflict,

477
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,700
the main characters trying and failing

478
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,200
in their own imagination to escape an abusive life

479
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,900
and try to at least find some peace and calm

480
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
within themselves,

481
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,800
but instead they're repeatedly confronted

482
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,600
with their abuser and horrific manifestations of them

483
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
and what they inflicted on them.

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think the painful takes a more interesting

485
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
and considered road.

486
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
While you're trapped almost completely

487
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
in Brad's perception of his world,

488
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
his actions are real

489
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
and have consequences that affect others.

490
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
His choices in how he dealt with his trauma,

491
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,500
how he raised Buddy,

492
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
and how he reacts when she's taken,

493
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,600
these are all reactions to his experiences

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,100
and how they shaped his view of the world

495
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,200
and how to act in it.

496
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I've spoken about the game's difficult choices,

497
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,500
but what's equally informative

498
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,900
is the places where the game takes choice away from you

499
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,600
or presents you with false choices

500
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,800
or doesn't even point out the alternatives

501
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
that simply didn't occur to Brad

502
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,900
because of the person he's become,

503
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,600
not entirely of his own volition.

504
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,100
Brad blames himself for what happened to Lisa,

505
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
becomes a martial artist as a post-hoc self-defense mechanism

506
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,300
against the abuse he suffered,

507
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,700
and raises Buddy the best he can,

508
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,300
but the best he can is to shelter her

509
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,400
from a world of people that hurt him and his sister

510
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,500
when they were young.

511
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,200
This itself paves the way for Buddy

512
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,100
to become the person she ends up being.

513
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,700
When she's kidnapped from Brad's care,

514
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,400
or perhaps to put it a better way,

515
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,200
escapes from Brad's care,

516
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
Brad immediately takes this as a justification

517
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,200
for perhaps what he's been training for his entire life,

518
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
a rampage in which all he does

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,900
is try to protect someone he sees as vulnerable.

520
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,100
Many characters offer Brad other options

521
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,300
or question why he personally

522
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,100
should be the one deciding how to raise

523
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,600
or deal with the existence of the only girl left in the world,

524
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
and he doesn't even really consider these questions

525
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
because for him, the answer was obvious.

526
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,900
He pushes past these questions

527
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,400
all the way to what a game would normally position

528
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
as a heroic final stand

529
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
where he finally starts to quite literally transform

530
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,500
into a monster and enters a haze of violence

531
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,600
where the background is just a chaotic swirl of colors

532
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,500
and even an army of enemies are horrified.

533
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,800
Brad is unable to pursue other courses of action

534
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,300
because of who his experiences have made him into.

535
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,000
The joy that he's become addicted to

536
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,600
is described as making you feel nothing.

537
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
It's very clear why something like that

538
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
would become a crutch for someone who's lived Brad's life.

539
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
By doing this, the story positions

540
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,200
a lot of traditional heroism tropes

541
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
as the result of a warped perspective.

542
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,700
One of the last lines in the game

543
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
before the final battle starts is,

544
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,900
"'I've been dead for 35 years. Today I live.'"

545
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,800
This is the first time in most of Brad's life

546
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
that the world makes sense,

547
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,900
him against what he sees as an army of villains

548
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,600
preventing him from being a father.

549
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,900
It's the only narrative that makes sense to him,

550
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,300
and the game encourages the player

551
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,700
to think about what went wrong

552
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,900
and why he can't think about it.

553
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,300
There are also places where the player

554
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,600
is offered a direct choice,

555
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,400
such as fighting or sparing his father

556
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,100
once he finally encounters him again,

557
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,700
which is itself a false one.

558
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,100
While you can choose to try to spare him,

559
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Brad cannot resist himself.

560
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,500
This is an important creative choice,

561
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
or at least an honest one.

562
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,200
Everyone wants to believe

563
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,900
they're in full control of themselves,

564
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,200
but quite simply, sometimes we aren't.

565
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,800
Humans aren't rational actors.

566
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Brad's been fighting manifestations of this man

567
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,900
all his life already.

568
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
What's one more?

569
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,900
The Painful is, fittingly,

570
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,600
a game about pain.

571
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
It's about the suffering we can experience in our lives

572
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,100
and how it can stick with us whether we want it to or not

573
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,800
and influence us in ways we don't always want to see

574
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,700
and in turn go on to make us hurt others

575
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,500
even when we think what we're doing is right,

576
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,700
and the hurt we cause impacts them too.

577
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,500
It doesn't always offer an easy solution.

578
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,900
There's no magical pill that undoes childhood trauma

579
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,100
or allows complete control of one's actions.

580
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,400
It puts out the scary idea that none of us are free

581
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,300
because we're prisoners of the events and lives we've lived,

582
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,800
but there's a certain hopefulness to it too.

583
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,000
For all his mistakes and inabilities to make better choices

584
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
and drug or trauma-induced violence

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
he can't stop himself from committing,

586
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
there are still real choices to make,

587
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,000
and these choices still have meaning.

588
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,500
There are places where Brad is marginally making things better

589
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
for some people or at least tries to,

590
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
and there are often times when you can literally choose

591
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,400
to lose pieces of yourself to try and keep others alive.

592
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,700
These little choices are meaningful and valuable.

593
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,800
The game rightfully acknowledges this by having multiple endings.

594
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,500
If you manage to outside of cutscenes

595
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,800
never take the combat-enhancing but addictive item Joy,

596
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,700
an item designed to be used in harder fights

597
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,800
that's quite difficult to go without using,

598
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
the ending is very slightly different,

599
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,300
and if you manage to finish the game in pain mode

600
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
where everything is tougher and save points can only be used once,

601
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,700
the ending is again just a little bit different.

602
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,200
I think the point of these endings

603
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,400
is that things can be different, even a little, if we try,

604
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
and that makes trying worthwhile

605
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
even if it doesn't always amount to something.

606
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,300
The point isn't that Brad is a good person

607
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,500
but that he has the potential to do better,

608
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,600
as everyone does,

609
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,500
and start asking the right questions about himself,

610
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,000
and this is a hopeful thing.

611
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,100
The final choice in the game is buddies,

612
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,300
whether or not to hug Brad and empathize with him

613
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,800
in spite of the pain he's caused her

614
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,400
and the life she will live as a result of this.

615
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,600
This is a difficult choice

616
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,400
and arguably an ultimately meaningless one.

617
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,200
Do you hug a dying man or not?

618
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
It doesn't matter, but it's a real choice

619
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,100
in a world of many false ones.

620
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
Brad wasn't a good person,

621
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,100
but he didn't have as much of a say

622
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,800
in what kind of person he ended up being

623
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,900
as he'd have liked,

624
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,300
and the idea that things could maybe have turned out better

625
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,600
and helped him make better choices

626
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
is the real hope of the story.

627
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,200
It's a hard-won victory to tell a story

628
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
in which nothing good happens to anyone

629
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
and the character you play isn't a good person,

630
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,300
but you're left feeling like people still have the potential

631
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
to do better.

632
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
This is something the final game,

633
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,100
Lisa the Joyful,

634
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,000
does its best to call back into question

635
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
with somewhat mixed results.

636
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,600
Lisa the Joyful's first segments

637
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
are an excellent microcosm of the positives

638
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
and negatives of its overall story.

639
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,100
It opens incredibly strongly

640
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
with a revelation about what Buddy was learning

641
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,600
during the upbringing we only saw in fleeting glimpses

642
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
during the opening of the previous game.

643
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Buddy is forced by Brad to kill someone

644
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,200
in order to begin to learn how to defend herself.

645
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
This shows us how she was able to escape capture

646
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,000
so easily in the previous games

647
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,800
and lets us a little into how she'll have come to see the world

648
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
and, of course, showcases Brad's own views

649
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,700
about that world in detail, too.

650
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
I always wondered who killed this guy on the counter here,

651
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,900
and the answer is probably Buddy.

652
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
â™ªâ™ª

653
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
â™ªâ™ª

654
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
But then, after a cool cut to the title,

655
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
it cuts to black,

656
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,000
and we get some regular expository dialogue

657
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
about what two characters were yet to really learn about are up to,

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
implying various things about character relationships

659
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,700
and the reasons why the world is the way it is.

660
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,400
We then cut to immediately after the ending of the previous game

661
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
where things continue in Media Res.

662
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
These twin openings are an indicator

663
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
of the two roles the Joyful has to fill.

664
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,500
The Joyful was a stretch goal for the Kickstarter for the Painful,

665
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,700
the mission statement being that you'll play as Buddy

666
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,500
and uncover the truth behind the world of Lisa,

667
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,400
but it turns out those are very separate things entirely

668
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,900
and actually quite jarring when done together.

669
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,400
The world of Lisa is interesting and mysterious,

670
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
but part of what made it those things

671
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
was that you were exploring it as a byproduct

672
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,700
of a much more personal story

673
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,200
where the apocalypse was just a way of putting these characters

674
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,100
into more extreme circumstances.

675
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,900
Exploring it in more detail or explaining it outright

676
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,500
would have detracted from the engaging personal story,

677
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,000
taken time away from it,

678
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
and, well, it would have ruined the mystery.

679
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You can carve a really sharp divide

680
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,800
between the parts that are about kinda just expositing

681
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,900
what happened in the past involving Lisa

682
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,600
or implying what happened to the world and who's behind it

683
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
and retroactively explaining the events of the previous game

684
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,100
and the parts that make up this really interesting story

685
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,400
about the last girl in a world full of monsters

686
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,900
trying to become its new ruler

687
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,600
by crossing every other warlord off a giant list

688
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,100
and becoming a little bit of a monster herself on the way.

689
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,100
The latter is really new and unique and interesting

690
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,800
while building on the themes and story we already know,

691
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
but the former is unnecessary and explains things

692
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,600
that don't need explaining

693
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,900
because they're not really what the story was about.

694
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,400
This doesn't just mean half the story

695
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,700
isn't as good as it could be.

696
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,100
It also drags focus away from Buddy's story

697
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,900
and weakens that half a little too.

698
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,300
It's not the worst thing in the world,

699
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,700
but I think more focus on Buddy and her choices

700
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,500
would have resulted in a much more engaging

701
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
and tighter story overall.

702
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
That said, the story that is there for Buddy

703
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,300
is honestly great.

704
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,600
Where Brad decided that for the safety of himself

705
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
and his loved ones, he had to close his problems off

706
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
from the world and hide from the people who threatened them,

707
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,900
hoping to keep them a secret forever,

708
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,000
Buddy learned the exact opposite lesson

709
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and concluded that the only way to be safe

710
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,900
was to kill everyone who could possibly pose a threat

711
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,100
and take control.

712
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,700
She's literally crossing names off a list

713
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,500
and slowly imagining more and more violence around her

714
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
as she does so.

715
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,300
The fun thing about stories with parental dynamics like this,

716
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,600
similar to some chapters of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

717
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,500
is through one character's behavior,

718
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
you simultaneously get to learn about that character

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,100
and the people who made them that way.

720
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,600
A good deal of Buddy's behavior reflects back onto Brad

721
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
and the lessons she'd have learned

722
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
either through his direct teachings

723
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,300
or through having to live with someone like him.

724
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,000
You're still learning about precisely what happened to Lisa

725
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,300
and what she did about it through how Brad and Buddy act,

726
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,600
and that's fascinating.

727
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,800
The massive cast of party members from the Painful

728
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
is not a feature here.

729
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
You just get Buddy and temporarily Rando

730
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,100
while Buddy levels up and the player gets the hang

731
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
of her new gameplay style.

732
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,900
While I said having lots of characters

733
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,600
that you could choose from and risk losing was cool,

734
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,100
having less characters isn't specifically a bad thing.

735
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Instead, the focus is on having one character

736
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,800
whose moves are more mechanically dense

737
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
than any individual character previously,

738
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,100
giving her both the ability to induce numerous status effects

739
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
like Flustered, Sleep, Bleed, and Poison

740
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,500
and a slew of generally good attacks, too.

741
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,700
Buddy's stronger attacks have a timing minigame

742
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,000
which can be quite tough to master

743
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,300
but are highly necessary for persevering.

744
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,300
Joy makes a return and the game's hallucinatory tutorials

745
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,600
from Buddy's psyche even quite strongly advise you to use it.

746
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
Apparently, the use joy messages were added in a patch

747
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
when players had trouble proceeding without it,

748
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,900
committed to not using joy the way many did in the Painful

749
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,100
because they knew there was an ending

750
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
specifically for not using it.

751
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,100
There is no such ending here,

752
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,400
meaning the joy mechanic can be properly used

753
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,600
by folks who skipped out on it before like me.

754
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,500
The story isn't the only thing that's divided.

755
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,700
The gameplay and story suffer from a much sharper divide, too.

756
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,400
Where the previous game had the almost magical interaction

757
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,100
between story choices and their gameplay consequences,

758
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,200
no such choices pop up for Buddy.

759
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,700
There are a couple of moments where you're given

760
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,100
the sort of typical moral choice of little consequence

761
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,700
you would see in inferior RPGs

762
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,100
like deciding whether or not to drop Rando into the pit

763
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,400
or whether or not to attack the pacifists.

764
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
It's a bit disappointing.

765
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Worse, with the Rando choice,

766
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,600
it doesn't matter which choice you make.

767
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,500
It results in slightly different exposition

768
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,100
and maybe lets you skip a fight,

769
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,000
but the same things play out no matter what

770
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
with no further impact on story or gameplay.

771
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,700
But with the pacifists, there's this chilling aspect

772
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,100
showing how far Buddy has gone

773
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,700
where you can't even talk to them

774
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,100
and attempting to or even walking past them

775
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
asks you once again if you want to fight them or not.

776
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,400
Every few steps, Buddy has to actively choose not to murder,

777
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,100
which, of course, is the highlighted option

778
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,800
like it's her first instinct.

779
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,000
You're never given any really difficult choices.

780
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
You never have to risk losing any useful items.

781
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,400
In fact, there aren't really any of the rarer items

782
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
from the painful that would relieve harmful effects

783
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,700
in a pinch like the poison-curing cigarettes

784
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,500
you find, like, six of in the whole game

785
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,000
because lots of the tougher effects

786
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,900
have been taken out entirely to support a game

787
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,700
with largely only one character.

788
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,000
There's basically no point to the shopkeeper at all

789
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
and the main path through the game

790
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
gives you an abundance of joy,

791
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
so item management is basically gone

792
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,000
and all the party member reviving perfume you get

793
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
only matters for a very short period anyway

794
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,800
because you're on your own.

795
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
This ruins what could have been

796
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,300
a much more delicate balance of items.

797
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,100
Honestly, my expectations for the joyful

798
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,900
in the first hour were super high.

799
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,400
I was imagining all the different ways

800
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,900
a version of this battle system

801
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,500
but mechanically based around having

802
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,100
just one character could work.

803
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,700
Status effects, item management,

804
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,600
TP management, learning the timing

805
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
of the better attacks, making the best use

806
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
of your one turn per round in a fight

807
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,300
could become scalpel-sharp concentrations

808
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,200
of important choices and a robust inventory system

809
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
where defense and armor have to be balanced

810
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,700
against resistance or speed

811
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,600
or trying not to get stunned or tripped or poisoned.

812
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,900
This could have made for a really

813
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,500
mechanically dense game.

814
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,600
I was fully prepared to say that the joyful

815
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
had the best gameplay of the three games,

816
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,900
and while this theoretical version of Lisa

817
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
does almost rear its head in a few

818
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
of the tougher fights against larger groups

819
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,800
or if you commit to not taking Joy,

820
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,100
it never really feels like you're being challenged

821
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,900
in any way other than nailing the timing

822
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,500
on Buddy's more damaging attacks.

823
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,100
I think the gameplay is still overall

824
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,700
very fun and really challenging,

825
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
but the awareness of how much better

826
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,000
this approach could have been

827
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,300
makes it feel like a missed opportunity at times.

828
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,500
One of the best and sadly only examples

829
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
of gameplay and story overlapping

830
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,100
is that your other party member Rando's attacks

831
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,800
are also called Armstrong-style

832
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,600
because Brad trained him as a kid.

833
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
That's just really cute.

834
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
The soundtrack, in addition to containing

835
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,300
even more heavily distorted and speed-shifted versions

836
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,400
of previous tracks, has a bunch of new ones

837
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
with an increased reliance on samples

838
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,700
including new instruments, vocals, and even air horns.

839
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,800
I remember putting a playlist of Lisa music

840
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,000
on at a friend's house, and once it transitioned

841
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
into tracks from the joyful, he made me stop.

842
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
I really like the music,

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,700
not just because I have horrible taste,

844
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,500
but because its use in the game is perfect.

845
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,200
Tracks like the almost abominable

846
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,500
666 Kill Chop Deluxe play during tougher boss fights,

847
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
and it's not just fitting but complementary

848
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,700
to the sense of being trapped in the hellish storm

849
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,500
of drug-infused violence Buddy has become.

850
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,300
This soundtrack is the most complementary to a game

851
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,000
since Fallout New Vegas or even Planescape Torment.

852
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,400
There's something to be said about the engagement

853
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,700
I felt with the joyful.

854
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,100
In Painful, my first time through,

855
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,200
I was almost afraid to open it back up again

856
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,400
and see how much worse things could get for Brad,

857
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,200
find out who in my party I'd become attached to

858
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,800
I'd lose trying to find Buddy.

859
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Joyful, fittingly for its title,

860
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,800
makes you feel like you have nothing to lose.

861
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,300
I took a break partway through Joyful

862
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,400
and couldn't wait to open it back up and finish it

863
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,300
and continue crossing names off the list.

864
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,900
There's something incredibly appealing

865
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,000
about Buddy's journey in spite of everything negative

866
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
I've said about the story.

867
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Spoilers for the plot in case you somehow made it

868
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,200
this far without playing.

869
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,300
Eventually, Buddy kills everyone on the list,

870
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,000
but then because the ending needs to explain

871
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,300
the universe of Lisa,

872
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,500
what follows is almost completely unrelated.

873
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,900
Buddy suddenly meets the man who's behind everything.

874
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
We get some exposition, a fairly easy fight,

875
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
a few genuinely fantastic character-exploring

876
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,300
hallucinations for a bit in the middle.

877
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,800
Bozo explains the plot you and Buddy

878
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,400
didn't really need to know about,

879
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,200
and then Buddy gets to choose whether to mutate like Brad

880
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,400
or cure herself using the Joy vaccine

881
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,600
we just learned about

882
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,900
and raise the next generation of humankind.

883
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,400
This ending really kind of disappointed me.

884
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,500
Like, mutating into a monster has so far been a metaphor

885
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,800
for being taken over by your worst instincts.

886
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
The transformation is fueled by joy,

887
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,900
but wanting joy is fueled by having something

888
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,600
eating you up inside until the joy ate you up

889
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,300
and turned you into a monstrous expression

890
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
of those feelings, for example,

891
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,400
turning Brad into a monster obsessed with protecting Lisa

892
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,900
and Buddy by proxy.

893
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,800
I wrote the part of the script covering the painful

894
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,400
a year ago before I finally decided to play Joyful,

895
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
and what I liked about the problems

896
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
that appeared in that game is that they're not something

897
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,400
you can choose to walk away from.

898
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
You take those parts of you everywhere,

899
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and you can't just erase them from yourself.

900
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,600
I literally wrote that there is no magic cure,

901
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
so having the game end with Buddy able to quickly

902
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,500
and easily choose to get over the traumatic life

903
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,200
that led her to be the person she is

904
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
instead of having to learn to deal with it

905
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,100
in the sort of personal human way

906
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,000
I'd come to expect from the series

907
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
was really jarring to me.

908
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,800
The skeleton of a really good story is still here,

909
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,100
but it's obscured by having to be all the other things

910
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,200
that it had to be,

911
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
and this really deprives us of the chance

912
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
to really explore Buddy and her choices

913
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
and how she would even go about moving on from all this,

914
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,500
but at the same time, I'm really touched

915
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,400
that this series about sadness and tragedy and decline

916
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,700
ends with a victim of abuse achieving what amounts

917
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,500
to some sense of closure or even a happy ending

918
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,000
and, earned or not, getting to put aside

919
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
their sadness and depression and self-loathing

920
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
and escape into the possibilities of the future.

921
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,700
I think it could have been done a lot better,

922
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,200
but I really, really like what it did.

923
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,400
In a way, playing this game as someone

924
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
who thinks a lot about design

925
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,300
and occasionally tries to make games of their own,

926
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,500
there's something inspirational about it,

927
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,700
like, the theoretical really good game

928
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,800
I wanted it to be doesn't exist now,

929
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,600
which means someone else gets to make that one.

930
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
That someone else could even be you,

931
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,700
and I think the truly fascinating power

932
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,100
about really good games is they leave people

933
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,600
with ideas about what they could do next.

934
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,000
They spread the ideas and concepts further

935
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,900
by being so good even if sometimes

936
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
they leave you wanting

937
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,200
or perhaps even by leaving you wanting.

938
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,700
Lisa owes a debt of sorts to both Yume Nikki and EarthBound,

939
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
which, of course, has inspired lots of other games,

940
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,900
including Undertale,

941
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,000
itself made by someone who also started out

942
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,300
making what amounts to an EarthBound fangame.

943
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,600
Some games are just excellent at spawning

944
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,100
this desire to add to them,

945
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,900
to create something using the ideas it leaves with you,

946
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,200
and, fantastically, Lisa is doing just that.

947
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,400
There's already at least two really fleshed-out Lisa fangames,

948
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Lisa the Hopeful and Lisa the Pointless,

949
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,700
and who knows what great designers in the future

950
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,500
might say Lisa was the inspiration for their own projects.

951
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,800
In my opinion, Lisa is already doomed

952
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,600
to enter the stream of history.

953
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I guarantee you 100%,

954
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,900
one of the future best games ever made,

955
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,000
one of the next indie mega-hits on Steam

956
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,500
or whatever platform will make it into the next decade

957
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,800
will be made by someone upon whom this game has left its mark.

958
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,100
It's kind of funny.

959
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,200
The games are all about trying to get over something,

960
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
move on from it, forget about it,

961
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,600
but we're going to see Lisa again one day

962
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,000
in a new form we might not even recognize,

963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,500
and, personally, I can't wait.

964
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:51,700
â™ª Listen in my head â™ª

965
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,000
Hey, congratulations for making it to the end.

966
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
This thing has been a really long time coming,

967
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,300
and I know I didn't make many jokes this time,

968
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,100
but I wanted to do the ideas the game presents justice.

969
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,900
Please let me know what you thought of this one in the comments.

970
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,600
I'm genuinely quite interested in how this will be received.

971
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,300
I'd quite like to cover Night in the Woods

972
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,900
with quite a similar format to this one,

973
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,200
but I'd like to know what people thought of this one first.

974
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
My patrons over on Patreon support me making work like this.
