00:00.000 --> 00:07.660
As Britain's EU referendum enters its final days, polls show that In-N-Out are down to

00:07.660 --> 00:13.860
the wire, because polls are so fucking trustworthy. In fact, this picture I surreptitiously photographed

00:13.860 --> 00:18.300
at my local Smith's implies that it's the undecided voters who will decide. That's

00:18.300 --> 00:22.660
right, the fate of this referendum rests on the people who have no idea what the right

00:22.660 --> 00:27.100
answer is. But it's a referendum, so we already knew that, didn't we? So, which

00:27.100 --> 00:31.620
am I supposed to vote for? Let's look at the arguments and see which is more convincing.

00:31.620 --> 00:34.660
The Leave campaign have some very impressive CGI maps.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.660
"...and Turkey joined the EU."

00:36.660 --> 00:40.660
Hold on, were those dragon noises?

00:40.660 --> 00:46.740
Oh, that explains it! I was operating under the assumption that immigrants were humans

00:46.740 --> 00:51.940
who wanted to work in our country, doing stuff that we don't do to keep our farming economy

00:51.940 --> 00:56.160
alive. I didn't realise they still had dragons in Poland, I didn't realise The Witcher

00:56.220 --> 00:58.220
was a documentary!

00:58.220 --> 01:05.220
Every week, the United Kingdom sends £350 million of taxpayers' money to the EU.

01:07.220 --> 01:11.020
That's the cost of a fully staffed, brand new hospital.

01:11.020 --> 01:15.580
The Leave campaign has really liked this claim. I mean, the EU video literally shows a flock

01:15.580 --> 01:23.580
of... money... birds... literally transforming into a hospital? But would that happen? Now,

01:23.580 --> 01:28.100
I might be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure the NHS is funded by a budget made up by these

01:28.100 --> 01:33.540
things called taxes? From this thing people have called income. The net cost of our membership

01:33.540 --> 01:40.120
is around £6.3 billion a year, or 0.3% of our GDP of £1.865 trillion. I accidentally

01:40.120 --> 01:42.480
said billion when I recorded this line before.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.860
Let's say we take all of that and throw it at the NHS. Great, but if leaving impacts

01:46.860 --> 01:52.600
our GDP by more than 0.3%—and remember, we make 13% of our GDP from selling stuff

01:52.620 --> 01:58.300
to the EU—there's less tax money to go towards the NHS, or anything else for that matter.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.680
And some economists are predicting the impact may be around 6%—20 times that!

02:03.680 --> 02:07.880
This image isn't a visual metaphor. This is literally what we're gonna have to wish happens

02:07.880 --> 02:13.560
once we leave. Every morning, you wake up and pray for the money birds to save the NHS.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.600
And every day, they all fly to the Cayman Islands instead.

02:16.600 --> 02:21.200
But maybe the NHS would be better off anyway. After all, there'll be less dragons—I mean,

02:21.200 --> 02:25.440
migrants—coming to abuse the state for benefits, which would leave more money for the NHS.

02:25.440 --> 02:30.320
Oh yeah, all those young, able-bodied workers willing to travel to another country to work.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.800
Famously, people who need the NHS.

02:32.800 --> 02:37.240
But the EU has so many regulations! They even regulate cabbages!

02:37.240 --> 02:40.680
It's not like you put cabbages in your fucking mouth!

02:40.680 --> 02:45.520
They even regulate pillowcases! You know, the things that used to kill people because

02:45.520 --> 02:47.920
the chemicals they treat them with were toxic.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.520
We need to cut all this red tape before it saves too many lives.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.240
It's putting too much strain on the NHS having all these living people walking around.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.080
Also, hey, wait a second. Even if we save money by not being an EU member,

03:00.080 --> 03:03.320
don't we still have to comply with their regulations to sell things to them?

03:03.320 --> 03:06.760
And won't everything we buy from them still deal with their regulations?

03:06.760 --> 03:10.560
And don't countries that currently make deals end up spending as much on tariffs as they would

03:10.560 --> 03:15.760
on proper EU membership but without having any input whatsoever on the actual EU decisions that still affect them?

03:15.800 --> 03:19.840
But don't worry. I'm sure we can get a better deal than Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.480
The United Kingdom is just too good to be ignored.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.840
We're 3% of the EU's market, and the EU is...

03:25.840 --> 03:27.840
a lot of our market.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.960
But trust me, we have the upper hand.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.360
After all, France really wants to buy cake from us.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.200
I'm proud to say we export cake...

03:36.800 --> 03:40.720
in growing quantities of particularly dense and glutinous kind of chocolate cake.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.160
We export from...

03:43.760 --> 03:44.880
Walthamstow...

03:45.760 --> 03:46.800
to France.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.440
They love our cake in France.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.640
Well, that's settled, then.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.520
But what would make staying any better than leaving?

03:53.520 --> 03:55.120
What are the arguments for remain?

03:55.120 --> 03:58.320
Cameron promises that we can get better deals within the EU already,

03:58.320 --> 04:03.200
because this guy, who can't even answer a straight question about whether he'd veto Turkey's entry into the EU,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.000
this guy can be trusted to argue our case to the EU.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.400
—And the leader of your campaign, Lord Rose, the former head of Marks & Spencers,

04:10.400 --> 04:15.440
gave evidence and said the price of labour will frankly go up if we leave the EU.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.440
So people will be better off if we leave the EU.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.880
—Well, that is what the overwhelming majority of experts all say.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.480
—He's your leader! He's your leader!

04:22.480 --> 04:25.440
—If we leave, you see the economy suffer.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.640
Hold on, did you just see that?

04:27.440 --> 04:30.800
Cameron's chief thinky man thinks Brexit would be bad for the economy...

04:32.640 --> 04:35.600
because people would have to pay their workers more.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.760
Oh yeah, I forgot, it's the Tory party,

04:37.760 --> 04:41.440
where people having more money to spend on goods and services is a bad thing,

04:41.440 --> 04:44.960
because most of their backers are the people who would have to pay people better.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.760
Sorry, why did he say this, is it untrue?

04:47.760 --> 04:50.640
—If you actually look at the full context of what he said, it's much more complicated.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.240
—It's not. I have it here, if you want me to.

04:54.080 --> 04:54.720
I can read it to you.

04:54.720 --> 04:59.200
If free movement were to end following Brexit, is it not reasonable to suppose

04:59.200 --> 05:03.120
we could see increases in wages for low-skilled workers in the UK?

05:03.120 --> 05:07.920
Lord Rose, well, if you're short of labour, the price will, frankly, go up, so yes.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.520
—But then he goes on to say a whole lot of other things.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.000
—That's not it, he says...

05:10.960 --> 05:16.000
—Oh yeah, this guy will convince Brussels to see things our way.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.520
Yeah, great.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.200
—At my office, I sit two yards away from the cabinet room

05:21.200 --> 05:25.200
where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler,

05:25.200 --> 05:26.320
but he didn't quit.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.400
He didn't quit on Europe, he didn't quit on European...

05:28.400 --> 05:30.160
—Oh, he's just like Churchill.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.720
Oh, look at his little face.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.160
Look at his little face.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.800
In any case, I don't trust remaining under a Tory government

05:36.800 --> 05:40.480
that so far tried to privatise all schools and hamstring the NHS

05:40.480 --> 05:42.560
half of them are now pretending to want to save

05:42.560 --> 05:44.480
by altering junior doctors' contracts

05:44.480 --> 05:47.120
and going on record as wanting to privatise the whole thing.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.560
If the man who came up with this shitty budget wants us to stay in,

05:50.560 --> 05:52.880
that's definitely a bad idea.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.080
Well, a bunch of banks and economic groups have said in their estimation

05:56.080 --> 05:57.600
that leaving would be a bad idea,

05:57.600 --> 05:59.440
but we shouldn't trust experts.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.200
—I think the people in this country have had enough of experts

06:03.200 --> 06:05.600
with organisations from acronyms...

06:05.600 --> 06:08.000
—The people in this country have had enough of experts.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.720
—What do you mean by that?

06:08.720 --> 06:11.360
—Organisations with acronyms saying that they know what...

06:11.360 --> 06:13.120
—Yeah, why would you trust people who know what...

06:13.840 --> 06:15.440
Okay, no. No.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.800
I'm not going to be sarcastic here.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.960
People have made fun of that statement enough already,

06:18.960 --> 06:21.440
and I think Gove, despite being the worst man in the world

06:21.440 --> 06:24.240
and I hate him and I hate him, has a point here.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.240
—Her Majesty the Queen asked the economists,

06:26.240 --> 06:28.240
how come you guys didn't see this thing coming?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.240
And then the British Academy put forward this,

06:30.240 --> 06:31.680
got all together, all these economists

06:31.680 --> 06:33.760
and they came up with this fabulous letter to Her Majesty.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.160
It said, well, many dedicated people,

06:36.160 --> 06:38.800
intelligent, smart, spent their lives

06:38.800 --> 06:41.600
working on aspects of this thing very, very seriously,

06:41.600 --> 06:44.080
but the one thing we missed was systemic risk.

06:44.080 --> 06:44.800
And you say, what?

06:46.320 --> 06:48.000
All these groups and economists?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.920
Did they predict the financial crash?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.440
Did they see that coming?

06:51.440 --> 06:51.940
No.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.280
None of them did.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.200
None of them saw it coming.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.200
So in a way, Gove is still wrong.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.680
We haven't had enough of experts.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.640
We don't have any experts.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.200
Besides, if Cameron thinks leaving is so bad,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.680
why'd he decide to have a referendum?

07:07.680 --> 07:09.040
UKIP wouldn't have given us one.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.280
—If you support a Remain campaign so passionately...

07:13.280 --> 07:13.920
—Yeah.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.960
—...why give people an option for EU referendum?

07:16.960 --> 07:18.400
Why give them an option to leave?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.200
Well, let's be fair.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.480
Cameron isn't stupid.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.720
He must have been well aware that a good deal of his camp

07:28.720 --> 07:32.000
wanted to leave the Union and a good deal wanted to remain.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.800
If Cameron had taken a firm stance in either direction

07:34.800 --> 07:37.600
during the election, he could have torn his party in half.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.920
The promise of a referendum allowed him to pass

07:39.920 --> 07:42.720
this party-wide instability off to a later date

07:42.720 --> 07:44.560
in the hopes that it would solve itself.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.960
So now we're in a situation where the party in power,

07:46.960 --> 07:49.680
whose leaders have been best friends in secret, weird,

07:49.680 --> 07:51.840
pig-head, fucky clubs for decades,

07:51.840 --> 07:54.720
still can't agree on fundamental decisions.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.880
Cameron could have tried to sort this out years ago

07:56.880 --> 08:00.400
utilizing the leadership that our elected leaders

08:00.400 --> 08:01.520
are supposed to exhibit,

08:01.520 --> 08:04.000
but why risk solving disagreements and contradictions

08:04.000 --> 08:06.720
within his own party when he has an election to win?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.800
Under a representative democratic system,

08:08.800 --> 08:11.520
the majority of people haven't had to think about this stuff

08:11.520 --> 08:12.560
for a long time.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.560
It stands to reason that they don't know enough

08:14.560 --> 08:15.920
to make these decisions.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.520
At the very least, I don't.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.200
Have you seen my videos?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.480
I'm an idiot!

08:20.480 --> 08:24.240
But here, Cameron is admitting that he doesn't have any idea either.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.840
In a way, the greatest criticism of representative democracy,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.080
that it shelters people from having to understand

08:30.080 --> 08:32.480
economics and politics because someone else is doing

08:32.480 --> 08:35.440
the thinking for them, has come home to roost.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.960
Now even our leaders have no fucking idea.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.560
So in the face of all of this,

08:40.560 --> 08:42.320
which should I vote in the referendum?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.320
No, I'm really asking.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.680
Which should I vote?

08:45.680 --> 08:48.880
Now, personally, I would vote to dig a really big hole

08:48.880 --> 08:51.040
and just push the Tory party into it,

08:51.040 --> 08:52.800
but that wasn't on my polling card.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.040
I can only assume mine was a misprint.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.920
But in the case of there really only being these two decisions,

08:58.480 --> 09:00.400
I can't decide between them.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.560
So I've decided to be democratic.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.640
Leave a comment telling me whether to vote in or out,

09:04.640 --> 09:08.000
and I'll tally them up before I head to the voting booth on Thursday.

09:08.000 --> 09:08.720
That's right!

09:08.720 --> 09:10.320
You can vote on my vote!

09:10.320 --> 09:12.000
That's double democracy!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.920
And just like in a real democratic system,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.080
I'm open to massive anonymous donations

09:16.080 --> 09:18.480
telling me to ignore the will of the electorate.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.440
I hope having other people decide my vote for me isn't illegal.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.560
I haven't actually checked.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.320
It sounds like it should be, at least.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.800
In any case, let me know what you think in the comments.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.560
Should we answer to Brussels with their needless regulations on lawnmowers?

09:30.560 --> 09:35.040
Or is legislating giant electric monstrosities full of spinning blades

09:35.040 --> 09:37.600
a thing that probably should happen in a society?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.600
Is immigration a burden on the NHS?

09:39.600 --> 09:43.440
Or do immigrants bring more money to Britain and end up less likely to even need it?

09:43.440 --> 09:47.200
And how many hospitals are we going to build with the money we save leaving?

09:47.200 --> 09:51.120
And does France really love our cake enough to give us a good trade deal?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.720
I guess I'll let you decide.

09:57.760 --> 10:04.560
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

10:04.560 --> 10:06.720
Thanks for watching, fellow plebs.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.360
This week I'd like to thank Jason Walter,

10:09.360 --> 10:10.320
Jeffrey,

10:10.320 --> 10:14.080
Jeffrey Ladd—I hope they're not the same person and I've got this list wrong—

10:14.080 --> 10:15.200
Jenny Angel,

10:15.200 --> 10:16.320
