0	7660	As Britain's EU referendum enters its final days, polls show that In-N-Out are down to
7660	13860	the wire, because polls are so fucking trustworthy. In fact, this picture I surreptitiously photographed
13860	18300	at my local Smith's implies that it's the undecided voters who will decide. That's
18300	22660	right, the fate of this referendum rests on the people who have no idea what the right
22660	27100	answer is. But it's a referendum, so we already knew that, didn't we? So, which
27100	31620	am I supposed to vote for? Let's look at the arguments and see which is more convincing.
31620	34660	The Leave campaign have some very impressive CGI maps.
34660	36660	"...and Turkey joined the EU."
36660	40660	Hold on, were those dragon noises?
40660	46740	Oh, that explains it! I was operating under the assumption that immigrants were humans
46740	51940	who wanted to work in our country, doing stuff that we don't do to keep our farming economy
51940	56160	alive. I didn't realise they still had dragons in Poland, I didn't realise The Witcher
56220	58220	was a documentary!
58220	65220	Every week, the United Kingdom sends £350 million of taxpayers' money to the EU.
67220	71020	That's the cost of a fully staffed, brand new hospital.
71020	75580	The Leave campaign has really liked this claim. I mean, the EU video literally shows a flock
75580	83580	of... money... birds... literally transforming into a hospital? But would that happen? Now,
83580	88100	I might be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure the NHS is funded by a budget made up by these
88100	93540	things called taxes? From this thing people have called income. The net cost of our membership
93540	100120	is around £6.3 billion a year, or 0.3% of our GDP of £1.865 trillion. I accidentally
100120	102480	said billion when I recorded this line before.
102480	106860	Let's say we take all of that and throw it at the NHS. Great, but if leaving impacts
106860	112600	our GDP by more than 0.3%—and remember, we make 13% of our GDP from selling stuff
112620	118300	to the EU—there's less tax money to go towards the NHS, or anything else for that matter.
118300	123680	And some economists are predicting the impact may be around 6%—20 times that!
123680	127880	This image isn't a visual metaphor. This is literally what we're gonna have to wish happens
127880	133560	once we leave. Every morning, you wake up and pray for the money birds to save the NHS.
133560	136600	And every day, they all fly to the Cayman Islands instead.
136600	141200	But maybe the NHS would be better off anyway. After all, there'll be less dragons—I mean,
141200	145440	migrants—coming to abuse the state for benefits, which would leave more money for the NHS.
145440	150320	Oh yeah, all those young, able-bodied workers willing to travel to another country to work.
150320	152800	Famously, people who need the NHS.
152800	157240	But the EU has so many regulations! They even regulate cabbages!
157240	160680	It's not like you put cabbages in your fucking mouth!
160680	165520	They even regulate pillowcases! You know, the things that used to kill people because
165520	167920	the chemicals they treat them with were toxic.
167920	171520	We need to cut all this red tape before it saves too many lives.
171520	176240	It's putting too much strain on the NHS having all these living people walking around.
176240	180080	Also, hey, wait a second. Even if we save money by not being an EU member,
180080	183320	don't we still have to comply with their regulations to sell things to them?
183320	186760	And won't everything we buy from them still deal with their regulations?
186760	190560	And don't countries that currently make deals end up spending as much on tariffs as they would
190560	195760	on proper EU membership but without having any input whatsoever on the actual EU decisions that still affect them?
195800	199840	But don't worry. I'm sure we can get a better deal than Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland.
199840	202480	The United Kingdom is just too good to be ignored.
202480	205840	We're 3% of the EU's market, and the EU is...
205840	207840	a lot of our market.
207840	209960	But trust me, we have the upper hand.
209960	213360	After all, France really wants to buy cake from us.
213360	215200	I'm proud to say we export cake...
216800	220720	in growing quantities of particularly dense and glutinous kind of chocolate cake.
220720	222160	We export from...
223760	224880	Walthamstow...
225760	226800	to France.
227600	229440	They love our cake in France.
229440	230640	Well, that's settled, then.
230640	233520	But what would make staying any better than leaving?
233520	235120	What are the arguments for remain?
235120	238320	Cameron promises that we can get better deals within the EU already,
238320	243200	because this guy, who can't even answer a straight question about whether he'd veto Turkey's entry into the EU,
243200	246000	this guy can be trusted to argue our case to the EU.
246000	250400	—And the leader of your campaign, Lord Rose, the former head of Marks & Spencers,
250400	255440	gave evidence and said the price of labour will frankly go up if we leave the EU.
255440	257440	So people will be better off if we leave the EU.
257440	260880	—Well, that is what the overwhelming majority of experts all say.
260880	262480	—He's your leader! He's your leader!
262480	265440	—If we leave, you see the economy suffer.
265440	266640	Hold on, did you just see that?
267440	270800	Cameron's chief thinky man thinks Brexit would be bad for the economy...
272640	275600	because people would have to pay their workers more.
275600	277760	Oh yeah, I forgot, it's the Tory party,
277760	281440	where people having more money to spend on goods and services is a bad thing,
281440	284960	because most of their backers are the people who would have to pay people better.
285920	287760	Sorry, why did he say this, is it untrue?
287760	290640	—If you actually look at the full context of what he said, it's much more complicated.
290640	292240	—It's not. I have it here, if you want me to.
294080	294720	I can read it to you.
294720	299200	If free movement were to end following Brexit, is it not reasonable to suppose
299200	303120	we could see increases in wages for low-skilled workers in the UK?
303120	307920	Lord Rose, well, if you're short of labour, the price will, frankly, go up, so yes.
307920	309520	—But then he goes on to say a whole lot of other things.
309520	310000	—That's not it, he says...
310960	316000	—Oh yeah, this guy will convince Brussels to see things our way.
316000	317520	Yeah, great.
317520	321200	—At my office, I sit two yards away from the cabinet room
321200	325200	where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler,
325200	326320	but he didn't quit.
326320	328400	He didn't quit on Europe, he didn't quit on European...
328400	330160	—Oh, he's just like Churchill.
330160	332720	Oh, look at his little face.
332720	334160	Look at his little face.
334160	336800	In any case, I don't trust remaining under a Tory government
336800	340480	that so far tried to privatise all schools and hamstring the NHS
340480	342560	half of them are now pretending to want to save
342560	344480	by altering junior doctors' contracts
344480	347120	and going on record as wanting to privatise the whole thing.
347120	350560	If the man who came up with this shitty budget wants us to stay in,
350560	352880	that's definitely a bad idea.
352880	356080	Well, a bunch of banks and economic groups have said in their estimation
356080	357600	that leaving would be a bad idea,
357600	359440	but we shouldn't trust experts.
360000	363200	—I think the people in this country have had enough of experts
363200	365600	with organisations from acronyms...
365600	368000	—The people in this country have had enough of experts.
368000	368720	—What do you mean by that?
368720	371360	—Organisations with acronyms saying that they know what...
371360	373120	—Yeah, why would you trust people who know what...
373840	375440	Okay, no. No.
375440	376800	I'm not going to be sarcastic here.
376800	378960	People have made fun of that statement enough already,
378960	381440	and I think Gove, despite being the worst man in the world
381440	384240	and I hate him and I hate him, has a point here.
384240	386240	—Her Majesty the Queen asked the economists,
386240	388240	how come you guys didn't see this thing coming?
388240	390240	And then the British Academy put forward this,
390240	391680	got all together, all these economists
391680	393760	and they came up with this fabulous letter to Her Majesty.
393840	396160	It said, well, many dedicated people,
396160	398800	intelligent, smart, spent their lives
398800	401600	working on aspects of this thing very, very seriously,
401600	404080	but the one thing we missed was systemic risk.
404080	404800	And you say, what?
406320	408000	All these groups and economists?
408000	409920	Did they predict the financial crash?
409920	411440	Did they see that coming?
411440	411940	No.
412480	413280	None of them did.
413840	415200	None of them saw it coming.
415200	417200	So in a way, Gove is still wrong.
417200	419680	We haven't had enough of experts.
419680	422640	We don't have any experts.
422640	425200	Besides, if Cameron thinks leaving is so bad,
425200	427680	why'd he decide to have a referendum?
427680	429040	UKIP wouldn't have given us one.
430080	433280	—If you support a Remain campaign so passionately...
433280	433920	—Yeah.
433920	436960	—...why give people an option for EU referendum?
436960	438400	Why give them an option to leave?
443680	445200	Well, let's be fair.
445200	446480	Cameron isn't stupid.
446480	448720	He must have been well aware that a good deal of his camp
448720	452000	wanted to leave the Union and a good deal wanted to remain.
452000	454800	If Cameron had taken a firm stance in either direction
454800	457600	during the election, he could have torn his party in half.
457600	459920	The promise of a referendum allowed him to pass
459920	462720	this party-wide instability off to a later date
462720	464560	in the hopes that it would solve itself.
464560	466960	So now we're in a situation where the party in power,
466960	469680	whose leaders have been best friends in secret, weird,
469680	471840	pig-head, fucky clubs for decades,
471840	474720	still can't agree on fundamental decisions.
474720	476880	Cameron could have tried to sort this out years ago
476880	480400	utilizing the leadership that our elected leaders
480400	481520	are supposed to exhibit,
481520	484000	but why risk solving disagreements and contradictions
484000	486720	within his own party when he has an election to win?
486720	488800	Under a representative democratic system,
488800	491520	the majority of people haven't had to think about this stuff
491520	492560	for a long time.
492560	494560	It stands to reason that they don't know enough
494560	495920	to make these decisions.
495920	497520	At the very least, I don't.
497520	499200	Have you seen my videos?
499200	500480	I'm an idiot!
500480	504240	But here, Cameron is admitting that he doesn't have any idea either.
504240	507840	In a way, the greatest criticism of representative democracy,
507840	510080	that it shelters people from having to understand
510080	512480	economics and politics because someone else is doing
512480	515440	the thinking for them, has come home to roost.
515440	518960	Now even our leaders have no fucking idea.
518960	520560	So in the face of all of this,
520560	522320	which should I vote in the referendum?
523200	524320	No, I'm really asking.
524320	525680	Which should I vote?
525680	528880	Now, personally, I would vote to dig a really big hole
528880	531040	and just push the Tory party into it,
531040	532800	but that wasn't on my polling card.
532800	535040	I can only assume mine was a misprint.
535040	537920	But in the case of there really only being these two decisions,
538480	540400	I can't decide between them.
540400	542560	So I've decided to be democratic.
542560	544640	Leave a comment telling me whether to vote in or out,
544640	548000	and I'll tally them up before I head to the voting booth on Thursday.
548000	548720	That's right!
548720	550320	You can vote on my vote!
550320	552000	That's double democracy!
552000	553920	And just like in a real democratic system,
553920	556080	I'm open to massive anonymous donations
556080	558480	telling me to ignore the will of the electorate.
558480	561440	I hope having other people decide my vote for me isn't illegal.
561440	562560	I haven't actually checked.
562560	564320	It sounds like it should be, at least.
564320	566800	In any case, let me know what you think in the comments.
566800	570560	Should we answer to Brussels with their needless regulations on lawnmowers?
570560	575040	Or is legislating giant electric monstrosities full of spinning blades
575040	577600	a thing that probably should happen in a society?
577600	579600	Is immigration a burden on the NHS?
579600	583440	Or do immigrants bring more money to Britain and end up less likely to even need it?
583440	587200	And how many hospitals are we going to build with the money we save leaving?
587200	591120	And does France really love our cake enough to give us a good trade deal?
591120	592720	I guess I'll let you decide.
