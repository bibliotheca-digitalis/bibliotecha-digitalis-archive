1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,660
As Britain's EU referendum enters its final days, polls show that In-N-Out are down to

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,860
the wire, because polls are so fucking trustworthy. In fact, this picture I surreptitiously photographed

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,300
at my local Smith's implies that it's the undecided voters who will decide. That's

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,660
right, the fate of this referendum rests on the people who have no idea what the right

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,100
answer is. But it's a referendum, so we already knew that, didn't we? So, which

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,620
am I supposed to vote for? Let's look at the arguments and see which is more convincing.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,660
The Leave campaign have some very impressive CGI maps.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,660
"...and Turkey joined the EU."

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,660
Hold on, were those dragon noises?

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,740
Oh, that explains it! I was operating under the assumption that immigrants were humans

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,940
who wanted to work in our country, doing stuff that we don't do to keep our farming economy

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,160
alive. I didn't realise they still had dragons in Poland, I didn't realise The Witcher

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,220
was a documentary!

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:05,220
Every week, the United Kingdom sends £350 million of taxpayers' money to the EU.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,020
That's the cost of a fully staffed, brand new hospital.

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,580
The Leave campaign has really liked this claim. I mean, the EU video literally shows a flock

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:23,580
of... money... birds... literally transforming into a hospital? But would that happen? Now,

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,100
I might be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure the NHS is funded by a budget made up by these

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,540
things called taxes? From this thing people have called income. The net cost of our membership

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,120
is around £6.3 billion a year, or 0.3% of our GDP of £1.865 trillion. I accidentally

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,480
said billion when I recorded this line before.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,860
Let's say we take all of that and throw it at the NHS. Great, but if leaving impacts

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,600
our GDP by more than 0.3%—and remember, we make 13% of our GDP from selling stuff

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,300
to the EU—there's less tax money to go towards the NHS, or anything else for that matter.

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,680
And some economists are predicting the impact may be around 6%—20 times that!

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,880
This image isn't a visual metaphor. This is literally what we're gonna have to wish happens

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,560
once we leave. Every morning, you wake up and pray for the money birds to save the NHS.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,600
And every day, they all fly to the Cayman Islands instead.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,200
But maybe the NHS would be better off anyway. After all, there'll be less dragons—I mean,

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
migrants—coming to abuse the state for benefits, which would leave more money for the NHS.

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,320
Oh yeah, all those young, able-bodied workers willing to travel to another country to work.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,800
Famously, people who need the NHS.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,240
But the EU has so many regulations! They even regulate cabbages!

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,680
It's not like you put cabbages in your fucking mouth!

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,520
They even regulate pillowcases! You know, the things that used to kill people because

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,920
the chemicals they treat them with were toxic.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,520
We need to cut all this red tape before it saves too many lives.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,240
It's putting too much strain on the NHS having all these living people walking around.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Also, hey, wait a second. Even if we save money by not being an EU member,

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,320
don't we still have to comply with their regulations to sell things to them?

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,760
And won't everything we buy from them still deal with their regulations?

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,560
And don't countries that currently make deals end up spending as much on tariffs as they would

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
on proper EU membership but without having any input whatsoever on the actual EU decisions that still affect them?

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,840
But don't worry. I'm sure we can get a better deal than Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
The United Kingdom is just too good to be ignored.

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
We're 3% of the EU's market, and the EU is...

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
a lot of our market.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,960
But trust me, we have the upper hand.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,360
After all, France really wants to buy cake from us.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm proud to say we export cake...

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,720
in growing quantities of particularly dense and glutinous kind of chocolate cake.

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,160
We export from...

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Walthamstow...

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
to France.

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,440
They love our cake in France.

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
Well, that's settled, then.

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,520
But what would make staying any better than leaving?

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
What are the arguments for remain?

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,320
Cameron promises that we can get better deals within the EU already,

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,200
because this guy, who can't even answer a straight question about whether he'd veto Turkey's entry into the EU,

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
this guy can be trusted to argue our case to the EU.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
—And the leader of your campaign, Lord Rose, the former head of Marks & Spencers,

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,440
gave evidence and said the price of labour will frankly go up if we leave the EU.

64
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
So people will be better off if we leave the EU.

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,880
—Well, that is what the overwhelming majority of experts all say.

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,480
—He's your leader! He's your leader!

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,440
—If we leave, you see the economy suffer.

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Hold on, did you just see that?

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,800
Cameron's chief thinky man thinks Brexit would be bad for the economy...

70
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,600
because people would have to pay their workers more.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,760
Oh yeah, I forgot, it's the Tory party,

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,440
where people having more money to spend on goods and services is a bad thing,

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,960
because most of their backers are the people who would have to pay people better.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,760
Sorry, why did he say this, is it untrue?

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,640
—If you actually look at the full context of what he said, it's much more complicated.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
—It's not. I have it here, if you want me to.

77
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,720
I can read it to you.

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,200
If free movement were to end following Brexit, is it not reasonable to suppose

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,120
we could see increases in wages for low-skilled workers in the UK?

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Lord Rose, well, if you're short of labour, the price will, frankly, go up, so yes.

81
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,520
—But then he goes on to say a whole lot of other things.

82
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,000
—That's not it, he says...

83
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,000
—Oh yeah, this guy will convince Brussels to see things our way.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
Yeah, great.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,200
—At my office, I sit two yards away from the cabinet room

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,200
where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler,

87
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
but he didn't quit.

88
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
He didn't quit on Europe, he didn't quit on European...

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
—Oh, he's just like Churchill.

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
Oh, look at his little face.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
Look at his little face.

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
In any case, I don't trust remaining under a Tory government

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,480
that so far tried to privatise all schools and hamstring the NHS

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
half of them are now pretending to want to save

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,480
by altering junior doctors' contracts

96
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,120
and going on record as wanting to privatise the whole thing.

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
If the man who came up with this shitty budget wants us to stay in,

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,880
that's definitely a bad idea.

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
Well, a bunch of banks and economic groups have said in their estimation

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
that leaving would be a bad idea,

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
but we shouldn't trust experts.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,200
—I think the people in this country have had enough of experts

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,600
with organisations from acronyms...

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
—The people in this country have had enough of experts.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
—What do you mean by that?

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
—Organisations with acronyms saying that they know what...

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,120
—Yeah, why would you trust people who know what...

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
Okay, no. No.

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm not going to be sarcastic here.

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
People have made fun of that statement enough already,

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
and I think Gove, despite being the worst man in the world

112
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
and I hate him and I hate him, has a point here.

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
—Her Majesty the Queen asked the economists,

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
how come you guys didn't see this thing coming?

115
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
And then the British Academy put forward this,

116
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
got all together, all these economists

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,760
and they came up with this fabulous letter to Her Majesty.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
It said, well, many dedicated people,

119
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,800
intelligent, smart, spent their lives

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
working on aspects of this thing very, very seriously,

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
but the one thing we missed was systemic risk.

122
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,800
And you say, what?

123
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
All these groups and economists?

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
Did they predict the financial crash?

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
Did they see that coming?

126
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,940
No.

127
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,280
None of them did.

128
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
None of them saw it coming.

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
So in a way, Gove is still wrong.

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,680
We haven't had enough of experts.

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,640
We don't have any experts.

132
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,200
Besides, if Cameron thinks leaving is so bad,

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,680
why'd he decide to have a referendum?

134
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
UKIP wouldn't have given us one.

135
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
—If you support a Remain campaign so passionately...

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,920
—Yeah.

137
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,960
—...why give people an option for EU referendum?

138
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
Why give them an option to leave?

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
Well, let's be fair.

140
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
Cameron isn't stupid.

141
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,720
He must have been well aware that a good deal of his camp

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
wanted to leave the Union and a good deal wanted to remain.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
If Cameron had taken a firm stance in either direction

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,600
during the election, he could have torn his party in half.

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,920
The promise of a referendum allowed him to pass

146
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,720
this party-wide instability off to a later date

147
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
in the hopes that it would solve itself.

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,960
So now we're in a situation where the party in power,

149
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,680
whose leaders have been best friends in secret, weird,

150
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
pig-head, fucky clubs for decades,

151
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,720
still can't agree on fundamental decisions.

152
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,880
Cameron could have tried to sort this out years ago

153
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,400
utilizing the leadership that our elected leaders

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
are supposed to exhibit,

155
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
but why risk solving disagreements and contradictions

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
within his own party when he has an election to win?

157
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
Under a representative democratic system,

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
the majority of people haven't had to think about this stuff

159
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,560
for a long time.

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
It stands to reason that they don't know enough

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,920
to make these decisions.

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,520
At the very least, I don't.

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
Have you seen my videos?

164
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm an idiot!

165
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,240
But here, Cameron is admitting that he doesn't have any idea either.

166
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
In a way, the greatest criticism of representative democracy,

167
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
that it shelters people from having to understand

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,480
economics and politics because someone else is doing

169
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,440
the thinking for them, has come home to roost.

170
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,960
Now even our leaders have no fucking idea.

171
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,560
So in the face of all of this,

172
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,320
which should I vote in the referendum?

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
No, I'm really asking.

174
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
Which should I vote?

175
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
Now, personally, I would vote to dig a really big hole

176
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
and just push the Tory party into it,

177
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,800
but that wasn't on my polling card.

178
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
I can only assume mine was a misprint.

179
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
But in the case of there really only being these two decisions,

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,400
I can't decide between them.

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,560
So I've decided to be democratic.

182
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
Leave a comment telling me whether to vote in or out,

183
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
and I'll tally them up before I head to the voting booth on Thursday.

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
That's right!

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
You can vote on my vote!

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
That's double democracy!

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
And just like in a real democratic system,

188
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm open to massive anonymous donations

189
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
telling me to ignore the will of the electorate.

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,440
I hope having other people decide my vote for me isn't illegal.

191
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
I haven't actually checked.

192
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
It sounds like it should be, at least.

193
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
In any case, let me know what you think in the comments.

194
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
Should we answer to Brussels with their needless regulations on lawnmowers?

195
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,040
Or is legislating giant electric monstrosities full of spinning blades

196
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
a thing that probably should happen in a society?

197
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Is immigration a burden on the NHS?

198
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
Or do immigrants bring more money to Britain and end up less likely to even need it?

199
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
And how many hospitals are we going to build with the money we save leaving?

200
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
And does France really love our cake enough to give us a good trade deal?

201
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
I guess I'll let you decide.

202
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,560
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

203
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
Thanks for watching, fellow plebs.

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,360
