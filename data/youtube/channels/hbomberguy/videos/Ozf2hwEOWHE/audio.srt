1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Oh, no!

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, no!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
â™ª

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,880
How dare you!

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,380
How dare you alter your unreleased game that's still in open beta, Blizzard!

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,940
Don't you know you're censoring...your...self?

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,820
Alongside this incredibly convincing argument, of course,

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,820
is the far more hilarious complaint that male characters are being treated exactly the same way and sexualized just as much.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,800
But what about muscular or topless male characters?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,500
They're sexualized, too!

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,600
Why does nobody complain about that, and they only whine when it's female characters?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,300
S-Jews are ruining games!

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,900
Save Tracer's butt!

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,500
Sign the petition!

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,500
How many times have you heard this one?

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,800
The claim that a muscular man is automatically sexualized.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,200
Is it a good argument against censoring female characters?

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,400
Have you even...looked at video games?

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,300
How is this even comparable to this?

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,000
Is this supposed to be sexually appealing because he's almost naked?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,300
I guess this man must be the most sexually attractive because he has the biggest muscles,

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,700
and muscles are always sexy, right?

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,900
It's almost as if sexualization is more than just nudity.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,000
Maybe for something to be sexy, there has to be deliberate posing, framing, and attitude instead of plain nudity.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,100
There's something that pushes it beyond that and makes it erotic.

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,900
And maybe part of the issue is straight men really have no idea what women and gay men find attractive in men.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:32,900
It's pretty obvious when this is considered more sexual and attractive than what people actually attracted to men think is sexy.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,700
Oh, Fabio.

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,200
Oh, ex-Benedict Cucumber Patch.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, Brad Pitt.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,700
But no, it's Feminazi Diss-Jews Conspiracy, I tell you!

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,000
They're taking all our butts away!

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hahahaha!

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Hahahaha!

00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:06,600
