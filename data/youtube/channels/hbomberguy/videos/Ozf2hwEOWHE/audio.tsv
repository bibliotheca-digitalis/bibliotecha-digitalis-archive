0	1240	Oh, no!
1940	4000	Oh, no!

7680	8880	How dare you!
8880	13380	How dare you alter your unreleased game that's still in open beta, Blizzard!
13380	16940	Don't you know you're censoring...your...self?
17220	19820	Alongside this incredibly convincing argument, of course,
19820	25820	is the far more hilarious complaint that male characters are being treated exactly the same way and sexualized just as much.
26020	28800	But what about muscular or topless male characters?
28800	30500	They're sexualized, too!
30500	34600	Why does nobody complain about that, and they only whine when it's female characters?
34800	37300	S-Jews are ruining games!
37300	38900	Save Tracer's butt!
38900	40500	Sign the petition!
40800	42500	How many times have you heard this one?
42500	45800	The claim that a muscular man is automatically sexualized.
45800	49200	Is it a good argument against censoring female characters?
51200	54400	Have you even...looked at video games?
54400	57300	How is this even comparable to this?
57300	61000	Is this supposed to be sexually appealing because he's almost naked?
61000	65300	I guess this man must be the most sexually attractive because he has the biggest muscles,
65300	67700	and muscles are always sexy, right?
67700	70900	It's almost as if sexualization is more than just nudity.
71100	77000	Maybe for something to be sexy, there has to be deliberate posing, framing, and attitude instead of plain nudity.
77000	80100	There's something that pushes it beyond that and makes it erotic.
80100	85900	And maybe part of the issue is straight men really have no idea what women and gay men find attractive in men.
85900	92900	It's pretty obvious when this is considered more sexual and attractive than what people actually attracted to men think is sexy.
93400	94700	Oh, Fabio.
94700	97200	Oh, ex-Benedict Cucumber Patch.
97200	99200	Oh, Brad Pitt.
100400	104700	But no, it's Feminazi Diss-Jews Conspiracy, I tell you!
104700	107000	They're taking all our butts away!
107000	109000	Hahahaha!
109600	111100	Hahahaha!
