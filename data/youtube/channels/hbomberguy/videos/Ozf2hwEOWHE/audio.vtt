00:00.000 --> 00:01.240
Oh, no!

00:01.940 --> 00:04.000
Oh, no!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.240
â™ª

00:07.680 --> 00:08.880
How dare you!

00:08.880 --> 00:13.380
How dare you alter your unreleased game that's still in open beta, Blizzard!

00:13.380 --> 00:16.940
Don't you know you're censoring...your...self?

00:17.220 --> 00:19.820
Alongside this incredibly convincing argument, of course,

00:19.820 --> 00:25.820
is the far more hilarious complaint that male characters are being treated exactly the same way and sexualized just as much.

00:26.020 --> 00:28.800
But what about muscular or topless male characters?

00:28.800 --> 00:30.500
They're sexualized, too!

00:30.500 --> 00:34.600
Why does nobody complain about that, and they only whine when it's female characters?

00:34.800 --> 00:37.300
S-Jews are ruining games!

00:37.300 --> 00:38.900
Save Tracer's butt!

00:38.900 --> 00:40.500
Sign the petition!

00:40.800 --> 00:42.500
How many times have you heard this one?

00:42.500 --> 00:45.800
The claim that a muscular man is automatically sexualized.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.200
Is it a good argument against censoring female characters?

00:51.200 --> 00:54.400
Have you even...looked at video games?

00:54.400 --> 00:57.300
How is this even comparable to this?

00:57.300 --> 01:01.000
Is this supposed to be sexually appealing because he's almost naked?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.300
I guess this man must be the most sexually attractive because he has the biggest muscles,

01:05.300 --> 01:07.700
and muscles are always sexy, right?

01:07.700 --> 01:10.900
It's almost as if sexualization is more than just nudity.

01:11.100 --> 01:17.000
Maybe for something to be sexy, there has to be deliberate posing, framing, and attitude instead of plain nudity.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.100
There's something that pushes it beyond that and makes it erotic.

01:20.100 --> 01:25.900
And maybe part of the issue is straight men really have no idea what women and gay men find attractive in men.

01:25.900 --> 01:32.900
It's pretty obvious when this is considered more sexual and attractive than what people actually attracted to men think is sexy.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.700
Oh, Fabio.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.200
Oh, ex-Benedict Cucumber Patch.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.200
Oh, Brad Pitt.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.700
But no, it's Feminazi Diss-Jews Conspiracy, I tell you!

01:44.700 --> 01:47.000
They're taking all our butts away!

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Hahahaha!

01:49.600 --> 01:51.100
Hahahaha!

01:55.900 --> 02:06.600
