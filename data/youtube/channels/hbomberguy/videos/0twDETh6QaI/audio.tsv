0	2760	If you've consumed any media in the last 70 years,
2760	4760	there's a good chance you've heard this voice.
4760	8880	This sound, man being eaten by alligator,
8880	11640	was recorded for distant drums in 1951
11640	14560	for a scene where a guy randomly drowns all by himself.
14560	17940	This recording then became part of the library
17940	20600	of sound effects people at Super Warnio Brothers used.
20600	22900	Another scream from that recording then appeared
22900	25440	in 1953's The Charge at Feather River
25440	28400	where a certain Private Wilhelm gets shot by an arrow.
29260	32720	They also use it, like, two more times in the same movie.
32720	37720	Sound designer Ben Burtt noticed this reuse
37720	40020	and started reusing it himself in student films
40020	41280	because he thought it was funny.
41280	43480	As a silly little joke, he hid it in the background
43480	45860	of a B-movie he was hired to work on.
45860	49820	Oops, looks like culture's been changed forever.
49820	55700	Burtt had accidentally started a career-long running joke.
56060	57880	-'Help me!'-
57880	59380	-'Help!'-
59380	61380	-'Help!'-
61380	63380	-'Help!'-
63380	65380	-'Help!'-
65380	67600	In his big cameo in Jedi, he does an impression
67600	69260	of the scream when he gets killed
69260	71320	by an OSHA-violating guardrail.
71320	72820	-'Help!'-
72820	74600	Then other people started using it too,
74600	75940	and now it's everywhere.
75940	76940	-'Help!'-
76940	78940	-'Help!'-
78940	80940	-'Help!'-
80940	82940	-'Help!'-
82940	84940	-'Help!'-
84940	86940	-'Help!'-
86940	88940	-'Help!'-
88940	90940	-'Help!'-
90940	91940	Getting in on someone else's in-joke
91940	93440	kind of risks ruining it,
93440	94940	but I wouldn't know anything about that.
94940	95940	-'Help!'-
95940	97940	And there's a bunch of other iconic screams like this.
97940	99940	-'Help!'-
99940	101940	-'Help!'-
101940	103940	-'Help!'-
103940	105940	-'Help!'-
105940	107940	-'Help!'-
107940	109940	-'Help!'-
109940	110940	Oh, Jesus Christ!
110940	112940	Like with Wilhelm, the source of these sounds
112940	114440	are usually well-documented.
114440	116940	That scream comes from a popular sound effects library,
116940	118440	and while we're ruining things,
118440	119940	those sheep-slash-goat-
119940	121940	screaming-like-a-human videos
121940	123440	you love so much?
123440	124440	-'Help!'-
124440	125440	Yeah, they're all fake.
125440	127440	That's just a sound that comes free with Apple software.
127440	129440	-'Help!'-
129440	131440	You're welcome, but for over a decade,
131440	134440	one sound's original source was unknown.
134440	135440	This one.
135440	136440	-'Help!'-
136440	138440	This is all over Internet video nowadays,
138440	139940	but where's it from?
139940	141440	Most people under a certain age
141440	143440	are yelling Roblox at the screen right now.
143440	146440	Roblox is a free online game-slash-platform
146440	148440	people can make additional content and games for,
148440	150440	and they can even monetize what they make
150440	151940	for, uh, uh, pittance.
151940	153440	According to YouTube journalist's
153440	154440	People Make Games,
154440	157440	Roblox developers receive less than 25%
157440	160440	of the money from sales of content they make.
160440	162440	This has led to the Roblox Corporation
162440	166440	attaining a net worth of roughly $7 quadspillion,
166440	168940	and one of, if not the, most iconic things
168940	170940	about this game is its death sound effect,
170940	172940	also known as the Roblox oof.
172940	174940	Videos of just this sound get millions
174940	176440	upon millions of views.
176440	178440	It has its own separate existence as a meme
178440	179940	across thousands of videos,
179940	181940	and one video claiming to be its origin
181940	184440	has 117 million views,
184440	186440	shockingly close to the lifetime views
186440	187940	of my entire channel.
187940	190440	This sound effect is a phenomenon,
190440	192440	but it's not from Roblox,
192440	194940	and this child is a liar.
195440	196440	Mmm.
196440	198940	Ah! Ah!
201940	202940	Now, I—
202940	203440	Ah!
203440	205440	I haven't played Roblox.
205440	206940	I play mature games for grownups,
206940	207940	like Fortnite.
209940	210940	Oh!
210940	212440	When I was the age Roblox would have
212440	213940	definitely controlled my life,
213940	215440	it was instead being controlled
215440	216940	by stop-motion animation
216940	218440	and then later by Garry's Mod,
218440	220940	a game which did not monetize its content
220940	222940	in increasingly horrifying ways,
222940	225440	transforming its community into a digital sweatshop,
225440	227440	but I'm sure the new way is fine too,
227440	229440	so no, I haven't played Roblox,
229440	230940	but I have played Messiah.
230940	233940	["Messiah"]
233940	236940	♪♪
236940	238440	Oh, for Christ's sake!
238440	239440	Oh!
239440	241440	Messiah was released in the year 2000
241440	243440	and developed by Shiny Entertainment.
243440	244940	They made Path of Neo,
244940	246440	so they're insane and I love them.
246440	248440	You play as a cute little cherub named Bob
248440	250940	who gets blasted down to Earth to help out.
250940	252940	This is the best opening cutscene ever.
252940	255440	Bob has no combat abilities whatsoever.
255440	257940	Instead, though, he can possess other people.
257940	259940	I'm a cop.
259940	261440	You know, in real life, a huge portion
261440	262940	of the angels who come to Earth
262940	264940	end up in the bodies of police officers.
264940	266940	It's true. Google 40% cops.
266940	268940	Bob can possess basically any living thing,
268940	270440	including rats when the developers
270440	271940	feel like making you save scum.
271940	273940	The player is constantly switching bodies
273940	276440	using their different abilities, credentials, and weapons.
276440	277940	The pacing is breakneck
277940	279940	because doing so doesn't slow you down.
279940	281940	I played Messiah in the mid-2000s
281940	283940	when I found it in a Christian charity shop.
283940	285440	I assume they didn't see the words
285440	287940	sex, religion, possession, death on the cover,
287940	289940	and then I threw it away.
289940	292440	I bought this copy on eBay to use as a prop.
292440	294440	I have to get this out for the rest of the video now.
294440	296940	Then a decade passes, and in a random YouTube video,
296940	298440	I hear a familiar sound.
298440	300940	Ooh! People tell me it's from Roblox,
300940	302940	but I swear I've heard it somewhere else.
302940	304940	Obviously, I immediately forgot about it
304940	306940	and moved on with my life until 2019
306940	308440	when someone else figured it out.
308440	310440	User PlasmaNode on Reddit
310440	312440	was watching the ending cinematic on YouTube
312440	315440	for some reason and noticed a very familiar sound.
315440	316440	Ah!
316440	317440	Boo!
317440	318440	Ah!
318440	319940	He posted his discovery on Reddit
319940	321440	along with a clip from the ending.
321440	323440	Someone stole and reposted his clip on Twitter.
323440	326440	A large Roblox YouTuber made a video about that tweet,
326440	328440	and then journalists started picking up on it,
328440	330440	although the articles do credit the wrong person
330440	332440	with the discovery because their one source
332440	333940	is a video that got it wrong.
333940	335940	Why did the sound get so popular anyway?
335940	338940	Well, if TV has taught me anything,
338940	341440	children being injured is just universally funny.
341440	343440	Let's not think about what that says about us.
343440	344940	Here's an interesting fact,
344940	347940	which I hope justifies me playing the entire game
347940	349440	in preparation for this video.
349440	351440	Everyone involved seems to think the sound effect
351440	353440	is specifically in the ending,
353440	354940	but it's actually all over the game.
354940	357440	You can fly around and flap your little wings to float,
357440	359940	and whenever you slam into a wall, Bob makes a noise,
359940	361440	and that's one of the noises.
361440	363940	It's also in the opening cutscene too.
364440	366440	Whoa!
366440	368940	It's kind of funny it was discovered in the ending,
368940	370940	the last possible place you would hear it
370940	372440	if you played the game.
372440	374940	Interestingly enough, there was proof in Roblox
374940	376940	the sound was from Messiah all along,
376940	378940	and no one thought to check.
378940	380940	You see, sound files have this thing in them
380940	382440	called metadata.
382440	384440	It's extra information that comes with a file.
384440	386940	You know, album art, list of the artists
386940	388440	and people who worked on it and so on.
388440	390440	You know those pirated Weird Al Yankovic albums
390440	391940	your friend gave you when you were 14?
391940	393940	Uh, that's why the album art was in there.
393940	395440	It was in the metadata.
395440	396940	I think that anecdote might be a bit too specific.
396940	398940	The oof sound in Roblox's game files,
398940	403440	ur.wav, has metadata in it saying it was made in 1999
403440	405440	while Messiah was being made
405440	407940	with the engineer listed as Joey Kouros.
407940	410440	Joey Kouros is an extremely prolific
410440	411940	video game sound designer.
411940	413940	He's worked on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,
413940	415940	Spider-Man, Gears of War,
415940	417440	and even Fortnite.
417440	418940	That clip I showed earlier,
418940	420940	that wasn't just me showing off my sick skills.
420940	422940	That was a clever setup for this bit.
422940	424940	No, it wasn't actually. I wrote a Fortnite joke
424940	426940	and then it turned out he'd worked on Fortnite, but still.
426940	430940	And here's Joey on page XXXVI of Messiah's manual
430940	432940	as one of the sound effects guys.
432940	434440	See? Look? See?
434440	435940	I don't have a camera person this time,
435940	438940	so I'll have to cut to a close-up that I shot later.
438940	440440	Uh, Rachel stopped responding
440440	441940	when she found out what the video was about.
441940	442940	So there we go.
442940	444440	We know where the sound effect was from.
444440	446440	We even have a good idea who might have made it.
446440	447940	Mystery solved.
447940	449940	We can all go home to our families.
449940	451440	I'm just kidding. There's more.
451440	453940	That's only the beginning of the story, you worm.
453940	456940	I can't say that.
456940	459940	We haven't even talked about who owns the sound effect yet.
459940	461440	It doesn't belong to Joey.
461440	463440	It belongs to the company he was working for
463440	466440	when it was made, Tommy Tallarico Studios,
466440	468440	along with its owner, Tommy T...
468440	469940	I don't need to say his name.
469940	471940	He named his studio after himself.
471940	472940	Are you ready?
472940	475940	Yeah!
475940	476940	Ooh!
476940	480440	Tommy Tallarico is a veritable video game industry icon
480440	483440	according to the first line of his biography on his website.
483440	484940	I wouldn't personally go that far,
484940	487440	but he was a fairly well-known musician and composer
487440	489440	for video games in the 90s and 2000s.
489440	491440	His most notable soundtracks include
491440	493940	Earthworm Jim, MDK, and Advent Rising.
493940	495940	His company was involved with the sound effects
495940	497940	on lots of other games from this period too.
497940	499940	That's why if you're my age or older,
499940	502940	this is burned into your brain.
502940	504940	Tommy Tallarico Studios.
504940	507940	He was also on TV on the show's electric playground
507940	508940	and Judgment Day,
508940	510940	some of the earliest shows about video games,
510940	513440	reviewing new releases and interviewing developers.
513440	516440	If you were around for a certain era of game history,
516440	517940	you remember Tommy from TV
517940	519940	or played something his company worked on.
519940	521940	He also co-founded Video Games Live
521940	523440	which produced symphony performances
523440	525440	of popular video game soundtracks.
525440	527940	VGL is universally recognized among gamers
527940	530440	as a thing they think they remember hearing about
530440	531440	that seems nice.
531440	532940	Through royalties from his company's work
532940	533940	over the years,
533940	535440	Tommy's doing pretty well for himself
535440	536940	and he's spent his money on living
536940	538440	in a very interesting house.
538440	540940	It has themed rooms, a Spider-Man room
540940	541940	full of all the original comics.
541940	544440	Probably have about $50,000
544440	545440	in your hands right there.
545440	546940	Giant statues of Lara Croft
546940	548440	and the Fifth Element Lady,
548440	550940	an ancient Egypt-themed dining room.
550940	551940	The list goes on.
551940	554440	The first thing I built in my house
554440	556440	when I bought this was a seven-foot waterfall,
556440	559440	but it kind of sucks because at night sometimes
559440	560940	I have to go to the bathroom.
560940	562440	Tommy is proud of his insane mansion.
562440	564440	That's why I've got so much footage of it.
564440	566440	He's given numerous tours of the place over the years
566440	568940	and it was even on MTV's Cribs.
568940	570940	He's so proud of that he re-uploaded it
570940	572940	to his own YouTube channel years later.
572940	574440	He's very happy about the fact
574440	576940	he was specifically on MTV's Cribs.
576940	578940	He says it a lot in interviews
578940	580940	and that's what he calls the video
580940	582940	he uploaded onto his own channel
582940	585940	and there's no way he would tell an obvious lie like that.
585940	587940	Would he?
587940	589940	Foreshadowing is a literary device
589940	592440	in which he also re-uploaded an old UK show
592440	594940	where the presenter clearly hates his house.
594940	596440	This is absolutely hideous.
596440	598440	You've got to sort yourself out, Tommy.
598440	599940	You've got too much money.
599940	601940	This is silly.
601940	602940	It's not right, Tommy.
602940	603940	No, but it is.
603940	605940	There's children starving.
605940	607940	And if you're the sort of person who's impressed
607940	608940	by Guinness World Records,
608940	610440	Tommy has a huge stack of them
610440	611940	leaning up against a cabinet
611940	615440	in the corner of his awards slash Indiana Jones nook.
615440	617440	The big one is person who has worked
617440	619440	on the most video games in their lifetime.
619440	621940	I actually have the Guinness World Record
621940	624940	for the person who's worked on the most video games
624940	625940	in their lifetime.
625940	627940	He's such a big deal he was handpicked
627940	630940	by Shigeru Miyamoto to work on Metroid Prime.
630940	633440	Metroid Prime with Shigeru Miyamoto.
633440	636440	I worked with him for, uh, many years.
636440	637940	And he was also the first American
637940	640440	to work on the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.
640440	642940	I was the first American ever hired, uh,
642940	644940	to work on the Sonic franchise.
644940	647440	Can you believe that?
647440	649940	Can you believe that?
649940	651440	Do you really believe that?
651440	653440	Tommy's been kind of resting on his laurels
653440	655440	doing video games live for a while now.
655440	657440	He hasn't done much new music for games
657440	658940	since the late 2000s.
658940	660940	One of the last things he did was donate music
660940	663940	to Super Tofu Boy, a game made by PETA.
663940	665940	It's a really bad Super Meat Boy clone
665940	668440	interspersed with quite good music
668440	670440	and interesting meat facts.
670440	672440	Listen, PETA, I've eaten a lot of tofu,
672440	674440	but meat doesn't scream either.
674440	676940	If it did, people would probably stop eating it.
676940	678940	Tommy is a vocal PETA supporter,
678940	680940	doing an interview for them in the Egyptian wing
680940	682940	of his house about cruelty to animals
682940	684440	and put out a statement on Facebook
684440	686940	responding to criticism of his involvement with Tofu Boy.
686940	688940	It's the only press release I've ever read
688940	690440	that has emoticons in it.
690440	693440	We can't really talk about Tommy
693440	695440	without talking about what he was doing
695440	697440	while the OOF was being discovered.
697440	698940	Tommy is most well-known nowadays
698940	701940	for what has become known as the Amico disaster.
701940	704440	In 2018, Tommy acquired the rights to Intellivision,
704440	706440	a game company from the 70s and 80s,
706440	708940	and announced he was making a brand new console,
708940	710440	the Intellivision Amico.
710440	713940	Amico aimed to be a truly family-friendly games console
713940	715940	with low age ratings on its games
715940	718440	and the bonus selling point of, uh,
718440	720440	not having online play.
720440	723440	Apparently to get people playing in the same room together?
723440	724940	Together again. Aw.
724940	726440	Some people would tell you online play
726440	728440	is one of the best features of modern gaming
728440	730440	and a nice option for people who can't easily
730440	731940	be physically next to each other,
731940	734440	and to that, Tommy's reply was no.
734440	736940	When I was growing up in the 70s, 80s,
736940	738940	and even when I was working in the game industries
738940	742440	in the 90s, you know, we didn't have the Internet, right?
742440	744940	With this pitch in hand, how did the Amico do?
744940	746440	It didn't.
746440	748940	It was delayed, supposedly due to the global pandemic,
748940	750940	but then it was delayed many more times,
750940	754440	and it still isn't out two years after the intended launch.
754440	756940	It seems less like unfortunate supply chain issues
756940	759440	and more like management underestimated
759440	762440	how hard it is to make a new game console from scratch.
762440	764440	As CEO, Tommy made the decision
764440	767440	to open two company offices in Irvine, California,
767440	768940	and Salt Lake City, Utah,
768940	771440	two really expensive places to open offices
771440	773440	in the middle of the pandemic.
773440	776440	In his video tours, the large, expensive spaces
776440	778440	are mostly empty and unused,
778440	780440	with the money guy in the back looking like
780440	782940	he's working overtime trying to keep this operation afloat
782940	784440	without a finished product.
784440	786440	This is where the magic happens.
786440	787940	Tommy wants money.
787940	790440	This is, this is, and this box is where it all happens.
790440	791940	As the money started to run out,
791940	794940	they turned to crowdfunding investment website Fig.
794940	797440	Tommy produced a video in his Spider-Man room
797440	799940	with other company leadership in his Egypt room
799940	801940	and Tomb Raider-themed movie theater room
801940	804440	claiming the console just needs a bit more money
804440	807440	to get going and release is just around the corner.
807440	809940	The rocket ship has been built.
809940	811940	We are on the launch pad,
811940	815440	and we just need the fuel to take off,
815440	817440	so strap yourself in because it's gonna be
817440	818940	one hell of a ride.
818940	820940	They raised $7 million more
820940	822440	and the Amico still didn't come out,
822440	823940	so they tried again,
823940	826940	turning to second crowdfunding investment website Republic.
826940	828940	They even used the same pitch video.
828940	830440	Come on, guys, the rocket ship just needs
830440	831940	a couple more million dollars.
831940	833440	Strap yourself in.
833440	836440	They raised over $11.5 million more
836440	839440	so they could continue to not release a console.
839440	840940	They tried a third time on a weird,
840940	843940	shady investor website that pretends to be a livestream
843940	845440	but is clearly prerecorded.
845440	847440	The rocket ship is built, folks.
847440	849440	We are on the launch pad.
849440	851440	We just need a little more fuel.
851440	852940	And then they turned to yet another
852940	854440	crowdfunding website for more
854440	856940	and canceled it partway through when it became clear
856940	858440	there's no one left to invest.
858440	860440	When internal documents leaked
860440	862440	revealing the console's internal hardware
862440	864440	was cheap, old, and rubbish,
864440	866440	Tommy threatened people who reported on it
866440	868440	with legal action, and when another journalist
868440	870440	asked what the reporters had done wrong
870440	872440	reporting publicly available information,
872440	873940	he deleted all the tweets.
873940	876440	The Amico's difficult non-launch,
876440	877940	fearful tossing of investor money
877940	879440	into two large holes...
879440	882940	There's not too many people here in the office yet.
882940	885440	...and its CEO's increasingly aggressive behavior
885440	887940	towards people trying to report what was happening
887940	890940	netted the company and Tommy some criticisms.
890940	892440	Tommy did the responsible thing
892440	894440	and started messaging people to call them names.
894440	896440	He defended the Amico on internet forums
896440	898440	calling detractors morons, idiots,
898440	901440	mentally unstable, narcissists, and cowards,
901440	903440	comparing criticism of his business decisions
903440	905440	to racism, eventually settling
905440	907440	on calling his detractors gaming racists,
907440	909440	the funniest term I've ever heard.
909440	912440	But these elitists, they're racists.
912440	914940	They're literally gaming racists.
914940	917940	He did this while following a bunch of actual racists,
917940	920440	white supremacists, and far-right personalities
920440	922440	on Twitter. This caused people to check
922440	924440	for his other hot takes and discover his opinion
924440	926440	on people who kneel for the national anthem.
926440	928440	Apparently racism is bad,
928440	930440	but protesting it is for douchebags.
930440	933940	Somebody just said I sound like a social justice warrior.
933940	936440	Uh, you couldn't be farther from the truth,
936440	938940	and I'm the most un-politically correct person
938940	939940	on the planet.
939940	941940	Don't call me an SJW.
941940	943940	You have no idea how racist I am.
943940	944940	People are saying I got triggered.
944940	947440	No, I'm just having fun and being passionate.
947440	949440	The folks in there that are, that are,
949440	951440	that are peeing their pants right now.
951440	952940	Things just got worse from there.
952940	954440	It hit the point where Tommy,
954440	957940	the CEO of a family-friendly games console company
957940	959940	in desperate need of investment,
959940	961940	would only give interviews with an ever-dwindling group
961940	964940	of diehard fans who completely agreed with this behavior.
964940	966940	The kind of normal person who wear a serial killer mask
966940	968440	while they interview you.
968440	970940	My wife told me to cancel my amigo,
970940	972440	and I still did not.
972440	973940	This is one of the last people
973940	975940	Tommy was willing to speak to.
975940	978940	And then if you want to hear me, um, uh,
978940	982940	pwn some noobs and, um, and, and punch back
982940	986940	at some haters, follow me on Twitter,
986940	989940	TommyTellerico, and, uh, you know,
989940	992940	I don't mind punching back to some of these losers.
992940	995940	He has since stepped down as CEO
995940	997940	with his replacement announcing the company
997940	999940	is entering a quiet period,
999940	1001940	which is a hell of a subtweet if I've ever seen one.
1001940	1003440	The amigo still isn't out,
1003440	1005940	and a lot of people want their money back.
1005940	1009940	In the middle of all this,
1009940	1011440	right before the first big delay,
1011440	1012940	before things got super bad,
1012940	1015940	back when Tommy had a reputation to burn,
1015940	1017940	the oof discovery was made.
1017940	1019940	Due to his contract with Shiny Entertainment,
1019940	1022940	TommyTellerico Studios owns all the sound effects
1022940	1024940	he and his employees made for the game.
1024940	1026440	Shiny could use them in Messiah,
1026440	1027940	but they belong to Tommy,
1027940	1030440	and he can use them again or sell them if he wishes.
1030440	1032940	And when Tommy found out a sound effect he owned
1032940	1034940	was being used in Roblox,
1034940	1037440	oh, boy, did the butter begin to churn.
1037440	1038940	Tommy stepped up to the plate
1038940	1040440	and did a stream on YouTube called
1040440	1042940	Talking About the Roblox Oof Sound and Controversy.
1042940	1044440	It's hard going back to this stream
1044440	1046440	because he spends a good chunk of it
1046440	1048940	pitching a soon-to-be-released game console
1048940	1050940	that still doesn't exist.
1050940	1054940	We're actually coming out with a brand-new video game machine.
1054940	1057440	It's called the Intellivision Amico.
1057440	1059440	We actually don't allow online play.
1059440	1061440	It's weirdly anxiety-inducing
1061440	1063940	watching a man in January 2020,
1063940	1065940	right before a global pandemic,
1065940	1067940	pitching a console whose central feature
1067940	1069940	is trapping people in a room together.
1069940	1071940	Everybody can kind of come together
1071940	1075440	and play in the same room together.
1076440	1078940	But when he wasn't pitching
1078940	1081940	his scam-adjacent business venture,
1081940	1086940	Tommy was demanding Roblox give him $100 million.
1086940	1089940	Tommy wants money.
1091940	1093940	Okay, for legal reasons, I'd like to specify
1093940	1096940	that was a joke. He didn't ask for that much.
1096940	1098440	Probably.
1098440	1100940	He didn't say how much he wanted.
1100940	1103440	Almost like he was embarrassed to.
1103440	1105440	Tommy made it clear he didn't want Roblox
1105440	1106940	to remove the sound.
1106940	1109940	He wanted them to keep using it but to pay him for it,
1109940	1112440	and if they didn't, things were going to court.
1112440	1114440	They may think that, you know,
1114440	1117940	I'm trying to get the sound taken out of the game.
1117940	1119440	I'm not.
1119440	1122440	They may think that I'm currently suing Roblox.
1122440	1124940	I'm not currently.
1124940	1126440	But it's also not fair to me
1126440	1128940	that I don't get compensated for this.
1128940	1132440	This situation is, legally speaking, very funny.
1132440	1134940	Allow me to pretend I understand it for a few minutes.
1134940	1137440	A key point here is, at least as far as I can tell,
1137440	1138940	so probably wrong,
1138940	1141940	Tommy isn't owed any compensation.
1141940	1143940	According to Roblox, the oeuvre came on a CD
1143940	1145940	of sound effects the original creators purchased
1145940	1148440	when they were making the game in the mid-2000s.
1148440	1150440	If this is true, they used the sound
1150440	1152440	with the reasonable belief they had the right
1152440	1153940	to do so at the time.
1153940	1155940	Whoever took the sound out of Messiah
1155940	1158440	and sold it on a CD could be in trouble,
1158440	1161440	but the two guys who started Roblox in 2006
1161440	1164940	didn't do anything wrong apart from create Roblox.
1164940	1166940	Okay, I've spoken to a couple of lawyers
1166940	1167940	after filming this bit.
1167940	1169440	Should have done beforehand, really,
1169440	1171440	and they clarified something I think I should add here
1171440	1173440	about them not doing anything wrong.
1173440	1175940	They did still technically do copyright infringement.
1175940	1178440	If you use a sound effect you bought from someone
1178440	1180440	and it turns out they stole it and lied to you,
1180440	1182440	you're still guilty of copyright infringement.
1182440	1184440	However, if this actually went to court,
1184440	1187440	there is something called the innocent infringer defense.
1187440	1189940	If an infringer can demonstrate they had no reason
1189940	1192440	to believe they had committed copyright infringement
1192440	1194440	and it looks like Roblox might be able to do that,
1194440	1196440	the court can reduce the statutory damages
1196440	1198940	to as low as $200 per infringement.
1198940	1201440	There are other types of damages like actual damages,
1201440	1202940	the losses suffered by the owner
1202940	1204440	as a result of the infringement,
1204440	1205940	but that's something that could only be answered
1205940	1206940	in a courtroom.
1206940	1207940	As you're about to see, however,
1207940	1209440	Roblox directly told Tommy
1209440	1211440	they don't think they owe him anything,
1211440	1213940	so it sounds like they think they have a good defense
1213940	1215440	if things go to court.
1215440	1217440	In these tweets a few days before the stream,
1217440	1219940	Tommy seems a bit annoyed that no one owes him money,
1219940	1222440	although in his version, Roblox feel like
1222440	1223940	they don't owe him anything,
1223940	1227440	which is a strange way of describing a large corporation.
1227440	1229940	I think what Tommy means is Roblox's lawyers
1229940	1231440	know what the law is,
1231440	1233940	but he still would like to have some money.
1233940	1236440	All Roblox are required to do in this situation
1236440	1237940	is remove the sound,
1237940	1239940	and Tommy could send a cease and desist
1239940	1242440	and trigger that happening whenever he wanted.
1242440	1244440	I could have sent a letter very easy.
1244440	1247940	Cease and desist. Stop using the sound.
1247940	1250940	It's mine. You don't have permission to use it.
1250940	1252440	Take it out of your game.
1252440	1253940	But Tommy isn't doing that
1253940	1256440	because he doesn't want it taken out.
1256440	1257940	Tommy wants money.
1257940	1259440	If he can get them to keep it in
1259440	1261940	and pay him a license fee to use it
1261940	1263440	or just buy the sound off him outright,
1263440	1265440	he could make a lot of money.
1265440	1268440	I'd rather them just, uh, pay me
1268440	1270440	and them own the sound forever
1270440	1271940	so that it stays in the game.
1271940	1273440	Tommy cannot stress enough
1273440	1275940	how much he doesn't want Roblox to remove the sound
1275940	1278440	because that's how he makes money from this.
1278440	1281440	Uh, I never asked Roblox to remove the sound.
1281440	1283440	I don't want it to be removed.
1283440	1286940	I haven't told them to take the sound out of the game.
1286940	1289440	I want to keep the sound in the game, so...
1289440	1291440	And Roblox probably want to keep
1291440	1293940	the immensely popular sound in their game.
1293940	1296440	However, they are a business.
1296440	1298440	Their ultimate goal is to keep
1298440	1300440	as much of their money as possible.
1300440	1301940	A majority of Roblox's income
1301940	1303440	comes from underpaying the people
1303440	1305440	who actually make the game's content.
1305440	1307440	How much do you think they're willing to pay
1307440	1310440	for .3 seconds of a child saying ow,
1310440	1312440	especially when they could replace it for free?
1312440	1314940	Uh, Roblox could remove the sound tomorrow
1314940	1316440	if they wanted to.
1316440	1318440	So when Tommy approached them asking for money,
1318440	1320440	Roblox offered him less.
1320440	1321940	We approached Roblox.
1321940	1323940	We said, hey, there's a situation,
1323940	1326940	and we're gonna ask for this much.
1326940	1329940	Roblox said, eh,
1329940	1331940	we think you should get this much.
1331940	1336440	So, so, you know, this much is what we think.
1336440	1337940	Just to put it in plain English,
1337940	1339940	the purpose of this stream is for Tommy
1339940	1341940	to complain that Roblox will not offer him
1341940	1344940	enough money to buy a sound effect they don't need.
1344940	1349940	I think they're, they're nuts and disrespectful to me.
1349940	1352940	This is an all-time classic Tallarico moment right here.
1352940	1356940	Complaining about respect while calling someone nuts
1356940	1359440	and asking them for more money.
1359440	1360940	It's just incredible.
1360940	1363940	I'm hoping that we can come together,
1363940	1366440	I don't know, maybe somewhere in the middle,
1366440	1368440	uh, to make everyone happy.
1368440	1370440	One question really starts to stand out
1370440	1372440	in this 90-minute stream.
1372440	1373940	How much money does he want?
1373940	1376440	He's very careful to never say how much he thinks
1376440	1378940	the sound effect is worth, how much he asked for,
1378940	1380440	or how much they offered him.
1380440	1382440	And I can't tell you, people are gonna say,
1382440	1383440	well, how much did you ask for?
1383440	1385440	Look, you have to understand
1386440	1389440	that it is not professional of me
1389440	1393440	to go around stating how much money I'm asking
1393440	1395440	and how much they are offering.
1395440	1396940	Just to be clear, unless there's some kind
1396940	1398440	of non-disclosure agreement,
1398440	1400440	which he probably would have said if there was,
1400440	1402440	there isn't anything actually stopping Tommy
1402440	1404940	from saying how much he wants for the sound effect.
1404940	1407940	The Amico saga has proven irrefutably
1407940	1410440	that Tommy does not care in the slightest
1410440	1411440	about appearing professional.
1411440	1413440	That excuse doesn't work.
1413440	1415440	He's choosing not to say it
1415440	1417440	and getting increasingly defensive
1417440	1420940	as viewers keep asking and he runs out of explanations.
1420940	1422940	To be honest, none of your damn business.
1422940	1423940	No, no.
1423940	1426440	How much did you say for them to pay for the oof sound?
1426440	1428940	Okay, well, I've already gone over that,
1428940	1430440	that I can't talk about that.
1430440	1432440	To an outside observer and the chat
1432440	1433940	whose questions he was dodging,
1433940	1435940	it started to feel like Tommy just wanted
1435940	1438440	a embarrassingly large amount of money
1438440	1440440	for a single sound effect
1440440	1442940	and knew that it would make him look
1442940	1444440	really greedy if he said it.
1444440	1446940	People are never gonna know, you know, what it is
1446940	1450440	and there doesn't need to be that knowledge.
1450440	1452440	He's in the fascinatingly awkward position
1452440	1455440	of not being able to say how much he wants
1455440	1457940	even though that's what the stream is about.
1457940	1460440	It would be unprofessional to talk about that,
1460440	1463940	um, but I think I did describe that it's,
1463940	1467440	um, a lot more than what, you know,
1467440	1471940	they were offering which was barely anything at all.
1471940	1474940	I think it's worth asking how much barely anything is
1474940	1477940	to a millionaire with a dedicated Spider-Man room
1477940	1480440	and an indoor waterfall in his mansion.
1480440	1482440	Everyone should have a seven-foot waterfall,
1482440	1483940	I think, installed in your room,
1483940	1485940	but the thing that's kind of bad about it
1485940	1487440	is that at night,
1487440	1488940	I always have to go to the bathroom.
1488940	1490940	Wait a minute. Didn't he already make that joke?
1490940	1492940	Later in the stream, he started taking questions
1492940	1494940	and someone asked him to give the ratio
1494940	1496440	how different the counteroffer was.
1496440	1500440	Tommy, percentage-wise, how far is Roblox offer
1500440	1501940	compared to what you ask for?
1501940	1505940	At least 100 times...
1505940	1506940	less.
1506940	1511440	So that, you know, if they offered me $1,
1511440	1512940	I'm asking for $100.
1512940	1517440	So, you know, if they offered me $1,000,
1517440	1520440	that means I'm asking for $100,000, right?
1520440	1523440	So that's how far it is off.
1523940	1525440	I find it very curious that he will say
1525440	1526940	how much he asked for,
1526940	1528940	but only in the form of a riddle.
1528940	1531940	Even more curiously, he uses very small amounts
1531940	1533440	of money as examples.
1533440	1535440	He chooses not to say, for example,
1535440	1536940	if they offered me $50,000,
1536940	1539440	that means I asked for $5,000,000,
1539440	1541440	or if they offered me $100,000, okay,
1541440	1542440	I can see why he didn't.
1542440	1544440	And I hope they come to their senses.
1544440	1546440	And I know they're probably watching.
1546440	1547440	I don't know. Maybe they're not.
1547440	1548940	It's Saturday morning.
1548940	1551440	So that was the situation in January 2020.
1551440	1553440	Roblox were offering to buy the sound.
1553440	1556440	Tommy wanted 100 times more money
1556440	1557440	than they were offering,
1557440	1558940	and if things didn't go his way,
1558940	1560940	he was threatening to take things to court.
1560940	1565440	You know, I have attorneys that I have teams of attorneys.
1565440	1568940	I usually have about 20 different lawyers.
1568940	1571440	It's just a difference of opinion
1571440	1575940	on whether or not I helped to bring millions of people
1575940	1579440	to their game or not and what that is worth.
1579440	1580940	That last thing is, I think,
1580940	1582440	why Tommy thinks he can ask
1582440	1584440	for whatever massive amount of money he won't say.
1584440	1586940	In his mind, this one sound effect
1586940	1590440	single-handedly launched the Roblox franchise.
1590440	1593940	But the idea is that this is a sound
1593940	1597440	that helped to create the franchise, right?
1597440	1600940	Some may say even that the reason Roblox
1600940	1603940	is as popular as it is now
1603940	1607940	may be because of the fact
1607940	1610440	that so many people share this oof sound.
1610440	1612940	So, some may say,
1612940	1615440	Tommy, you don't need to launder your arguments like that.
1615440	1618440	You are the one saying that right now.
1618440	1620440	This is something that helped
1620440	1622940	to create the franchise itself.
1622940	1627440	It's made the game Roblox go supersonic.
1627440	1628440	It was part of the reason.
1628440	1631440	How many millions of people found out
1631440	1634440	about the game Roblox because of a meme
1634440	1637440	that used because of the sound, right?
1637440	1640440	We think we're asking for something extremely fair
1640440	1643940	considering what it has done for the franchise.
1643940	1646440	These claims are hilarious, exaggerated,
1646440	1648440	but most of all, wrong.
1648440	1649940	Take the sound effects from Minecraft
1649940	1652940	that are really popular and people use a lot in videos too.
1652940	1654940	They have a huge presence online as well,
1654940	1657440	but they didn't make Minecraft popular.
1657440	1659440	They're popular because they're in a game
1659440	1661440	millions of children have played.
1661440	1663940	The Roblox oof took off in mid-2017
1663940	1666940	when Roblox was already a pretty mainstream thing.
1666940	1669440	The cause and effect is completely backwards here.
1669440	1671440	While it might not be entirely impossible
1671440	1674440	for a single sound effect to make a game very popular,
1674440	1676440	I would like to remind everyone
1676440	1678440	that this sound effect was already in a game,
1678440	1680440	and that game was such a massive critical
1680440	1682940	and commercial failure that no one noticed
1682940	1686440	the sound effect had been stolen for 20 fucking years.
1686440	1687440	Come on, bud.
1687440	1689440	Roblox didn't become a multi-billion dollar company
1689440	1690940	because of a sound effect.
1690940	1692440	They got there by being evil.
1692440	1695440	Speaking of evil, Roblox eventually worked with Tommy
1695440	1697940	to turn all of this into a whole new way
1697940	1700440	of monetizing their empire of nightmares.
1700440	1702440	Instead of paying Tommy for the sound,
1702440	1704440	they're making the players pay for it.
1704440	1706440	In November 2020, Roblox announced
1706440	1708440	the oof sound was going to be removed,
1708440	1710440	but they were updating their developer marketplace
1710440	1712940	so players could purchase sounds to use in their games,
1712940	1714940	and once this update was complete,
1714940	1717440	the oof sound could be purchased and used through there.
1717440	1719440	I assume Tommy would get a cut from this.
1719440	1721940	Simultaneously, Tommy announced he had produced
1721940	1723440	a sound effects pack for creators
1723440	1725940	to use in their Roblox games, including the oof.
1725940	1730940	I have done a brand new sound design library
1730940	1732940	just for Roblox.
1732940	1735440	Creators could buy a range of sound effects packs
1735440	1737940	costing from $10 to $250
1737940	1739940	and use these in the games they make.
1739940	1742940	Roblox and Tommy agreed to keep the sound in the game
1742940	1744940	as is for a while so the sound marketplace
1744940	1746440	had time to get up and running
1746440	1748940	and no one had to go oof-less in the meantime.
1748940	1750440	But this functionality still hasn't been added
1750440	1751940	a year and a half later.
1751940	1753440	Eventually, in July this year,
1753440	1756440	Roblox, citing a licensing issue,
1756440	1758940	removed the sound and replaced it with this one.
1758940	1761940	Gah! Which is rubbish, frankly,
1761940	1764440	but it might be bad on purpose to incentivize paying
1764440	1766940	to replace it once they get the marketplace up.
1766940	1769940	So clever move, I guess.
1769940	1771940	You bags of scum!
1771940	1774440	Tommy also got to make some official oof merch,
1774440	1775940	so that was nice for him, I suppose.
1775940	1779440	I've created an oof T-shirt.
1779440	1781940	It doesn't look like he got the massive payday he wanted,
1781940	1783940	especially since the audio marketplace
1783940	1785440	hasn't manifested yet,
1785440	1786940	but at least he got something out of it.
1786940	1788440	So there we go.
1788440	1790440	Wasn't that an interesting story?
1790440	1792440	That's the end of the video essay.
1792440	1793940	Don't look at the run time.
1793940	1795440	Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
1795440	1798440	If you came here to find the origins of a sound effect,
1798440	1799440	you can go.
1799440	1800940	Subscribe on the way out if you'd like,
1800940	1802440	but take care.
1802440	1804440	Go play Roblox or something.
1804440	1806940	And, uh, Tommy, I know you're watching.
1806940	1808440	I've seen you arguing with people in the comments
1808440	1810440	of videos with 100 views.
1810440	1811440	You can go as well.
1811440	1814440	Go do whatever it is you do in your fun house.
1814440	1816440	I'm just chilling out.
1816440	1817440	See ya.
1817440	1823440	♪
1823440	1825440	Okay, I think they're gone.
1825440	1829440	♪
1829440	1831940	This video is being filmed at an undisclosed location
1831940	1833440	to avoid being traced.
1833440	1835940	Also, Mom went on holiday and she locked the garage
1835940	1836940	so I can't get to my set.
1836940	1839440	And no, I have no idea why the back wall
1839440	1841440	of this room is also green.
1841440	1843940	The last guy who lived here had terrible taste.
1843940	1847440	Anyway, I think he's gone.
1847440	1850440	Okay, we need to talk about Tommy.
1850440	1852940	This is where the video was supposed to finish.
1852940	1855440	So I was writing up the script and doing a bit more research,
1855440	1858940	and then I re-watched Tommy's E3 2021 pitch
1858940	1861440	for the Amico, and I realized something.
1861440	1864440	He takes credit for creating the oomph
1864440	1866940	in a very particular way.
1866940	1870940	I'm even the guy who did the oomph sound for Roblox.
1870940	1873940	He made the sound for Roblox?
1873940	1876440	I thought I misheard him or maybe he misspoke,
1876440	1877940	but no, that's how he says it.
1877940	1880440	The thing that you might know me the most from
1880440	1883440	is the guy who created
1883440	1886940	the beloved oomph sound for Roblox.
1886940	1887940	That's right.
1887940	1889440	The sound wasn't made for Roblox.
1889440	1891940	It was made for another game and reused by mistake.
1891940	1893940	That's what this whole thing was about, Tommy.
1893940	1895440	He said that one in the commercial
1895440	1897440	for his sound design kits he's selling
1897440	1898940	to put it back in the game.
1898940	1900440	Why is he saying it like that?
1900440	1903940	Well, obviously the idea he made it for Roblox,
1903940	1905940	this massive, important corporation,
1905940	1908940	is slightly more prestigious than the truth, isn't it?
1908940	1910940	So he's slightly altering the story
1910940	1912440	to give himself a bit more credit,
1912440	1914440	and that's fine. Like, whatever. Who cares?
1914440	1915940	But then I thought, you know,
1915940	1918440	for a sound with another guy's name on it,
1918440	1921940	he seems pretty happy to say he personally made it
1921940	1923440	for Roblox.
1923440	1924940	From an outsider's perspective,
1924940	1927440	it looks a bit like Tommy is taking credit
1927440	1929940	for something someone who worked for him did
1929940	1931440	decades later.
1931440	1933940	And yeah, sure, my script was almost done,
1933940	1936940	but I couldn't let that possibility sit unexplored.
1936940	1940940	So I tried to figure out who actually made the sound,
1940940	1942940	and what I discovered was...
1942940	1944440	interesting.
1944440	1945940	And then a bunch more other shit happened,
1945940	1947940	and now the video is this long.
1947940	1949440	I'm so sorry.
1949440	1953940	♪
1953940	1955940	Yes, Joey's name is on the file,
1955940	1958940	but that doesn't necessarily mean he created it.
1958940	1960940	If he did the final exporting of the sounds
1960940	1962940	Tallarico Studios made for Messiah,
1962940	1965440	his audio program would put his name on them
1965440	1967940	regardless of who recorded, edited, or mastered them.
1967940	1971940	Instead, let's look at how Tommy talks about who made it.
1971940	1974440	Let's rewind the clock a little.
1974440	1977440	Back in 2019, Tommy quote-tweeted that one video
1977440	1979940	that was a repost of the thing PlasmaNode put on Reddit.
1979940	1982440	He indicates that his company created
1982440	1984440	and owns the sounds used for Messiah
1984440	1986940	and that the sound effects was created
1986940	1989440	by my lead sound designer Joey Kouros.
1989440	1992940	Notice that he specifically doesn't say that he made it.
1992940	1994940	He says his company created and owns it
1994940	1996940	and then specifically credits Joey,
1996940	1999940	implying little to no direct personal involvement.
1999940	2003440	I believe this version of Tommy's story is true.
2003440	2005440	However, soon after writing this,
2005940	2008440	to put it bluntly, it looks like Tommy realized
2008440	2009940	how popular the sound was.
2009940	2011940	He's said in many places, including the livestream,
2011940	2014440	that he didn't really know that much about Roblox
2014440	2016440	until he found out one of his sounds was in it.
2016440	2019440	So on a timeline, it looks like he wrote that tweet
2019440	2022440	and then started looking at the sound's presence online.
2022440	2024940	In his next tweet, he says he's surprised
2024940	2028440	to discover the sound has tens of millions of views online
2028440	2032440	and then all of a sudden it's a sound we created
2032440	2034440	and then, and he adds this in parenthesis
2034440	2036440	like he's trying to sneak it into the story
2036440	2037440	at the last minute,
2037440	2039940	and I myself recorded.
2039940	2041440	This is a bit of a change, isn't it?
2041440	2043440	It's also just a weird way of talking
2043440	2044940	about something you created.
2044940	2047440	Like, if you found out something you had made,
2047440	2050440	you, was in a huge game, you would go,
2050440	2051440	hey, I made that.
2051440	2052940	You wouldn't go, as you can see,
2052940	2055440	my company created and owns that.
2055440	2057940	It was made by someone who worked for me decades ago.
2057940	2059440	Oh, wait, the sound's really popular.
2059440	2062440	I mean, we made it and I myself recorded it.
2062440	2063440	And to his credit,
2063440	2065440	I think Tommy noticed how this sounds too
2065440	2068440	because 30 minutes later, he tried again.
2068440	2070440	He started a second thread where this time
2070440	2074440	it's a sound he created, Joey edited, and he owns.
2074440	2077440	Note that he specifically used the word created again.
2077440	2079440	So he got his story straight in the end at least.
2079440	2080440	Good for him.
2080440	2082440	But that does mean this first tweet
2082440	2084440	is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?
2084440	2086440	Now, you tell me,
2086440	2089440	what one thing would make Tommy look more like
2089440	2093440	he was trying to rewrite the history after the fact here?
2093440	2095440	Deleting the tweet, right?
2095440	2096440	From my perspective,
2096440	2098440	that would be a very stupid thing to do.
2098440	2100440	But I must be missing something because he did delete it.
2100440	2101440	It's gone.
2101440	2104440	I am not accusing famous industry veteran
2104440	2107440	Tommy Tallarico of lying about who made a sound here.
2107440	2110440	I don't know for sure who did what on this sound.
2110440	2113440	But Tommy should.
2113440	2115440	And if he's telling the truth,
2115440	2117440	why did the truth change
2117440	2120440	when he was surprised by how popular the sound was?
2120440	2122440	In a very short span of time,
2122440	2124440	Tommy's version of history went from
2124440	2127440	Joey created it to we created it
2127440	2129440	to I created it,
2129440	2131440	and then later an attempt to delete the fact
2131440	2133440	he said Joey created it.
2133440	2134440	I know how it sounds.
2134440	2136440	It would be weird to assume someone just wants to brag
2136440	2139440	about making this one sound effect this badly.
2139440	2141440	But he does brag about it.
2141440	2143440	He put it in his Twitter handle.
2143440	2145440	It's part of his pitch for the Amico.
2145440	2147440	It seems very important to Tommy
2147440	2149440	that he doesn't just own the sound,
2149440	2151440	that he personally created it.
2151440	2153440	To most people younger than me,
2153440	2155440	that sound effect could be the most well-known thing
2155440	2158440	on his resume, which is a bit depressing, really.
2158440	2160440	And when he tries to describe the process
2160440	2163440	of creating the sound, things get even weirder.
2163440	2165440	In the OOF livestream,
2165440	2167440	Tommy's happy to say he made the sound,
2167440	2170440	but then he tries to go into detail about how it was made.
2170440	2172440	I thought what first I would do
2172440	2177440	is talk about how the OOF sound was created.
2177440	2179440	When he talks about the work
2179440	2180440	that went into making the sound,
2180440	2182440	he doesn't say he did anything.
2182440	2184440	He says we.
2184440	2187440	Then what we did is we went through,
2187440	2188440	you know, all the different lines.
2188440	2192440	We did a whole bunch of other stuff to it as well.
2192440	2194440	So after we pitch shifted it down and then...
2194440	2197440	Sometimes he accidentally says I and then corrects himself.
2197440	2201440	I wanted to let folks know how I created the sound,
2201440	2202440	how we created the sound,
2202440	2206440	myself and my sound designer Joey Kuras.
2206440	2207440	It just keeps going like this.
2207440	2210440	We start to tweak the sound, each individual sound.
2210440	2213440	So again, in OOF, we might have spent, you know,
2213440	2216440	a half hour trying to figure out exactly
2216440	2218440	which way we should have pitched it down
2218440	2221440	and what thing we would have taken and this and that.
2222440	2223440	OOF!
2223440	2227440	This is a strange way to describe something you did.
2227440	2230440	Far from being a sound he created and Joey merely edited,
2230440	2232440	whenever he has to describe any specifics,
2232440	2235440	all of a sudden it was done by committee.
2235440	2237440	Tommy isn't lying about who did what here.
2237440	2238440	Quite the opposite, really.
2238440	2240440	He's specifically avoiding lying
2240440	2242440	by being as vague as possible about something
2242440	2244440	it would be easy to talk about
2244440	2246440	if he actually made the sound himself.
2246440	2250440	So I took this little girl's, uh,
2250440	2252440	we took the clip, right,
2252440	2256440	and then what we did is we edited it
2256440	2260440	and we kept the length of the sound.
2260440	2264440	He struggles to come up with anything he actually did.
2264440	2267440	Like, his knowledge helped?
2267440	2271440	And, um, we'll say, uh...
2272440	2273440	I want to say this right.
2273440	2279440	I mean, it took a lot of my knowledge of audio
2279440	2283440	to create this sound and make it sound unique.
2283440	2285440	Now that people know about me,
2285440	2288440	they know about how I created the Roblox sound.
2288440	2291440	After seeing a guy specifically avoid saying I
2291440	2293440	and say we dozens of times
2293440	2295440	and then finish the story by saying,
2295440	2297440	so that's how I made the sound,
2297440	2299440	it just comes off really disingenuous.
2299440	2302440	One quick indicator of what he could mean by we is
2302440	2305440	at one point he uses it to describe the act
2305440	2307440	of exporting the sound out of the program.
2307440	2310440	You know, compressing it and making it all,
2310440	2312440	EQing it and doing all these crazy things to it.
2312440	2315440	Uh, before we ended up saving it out, so...
2315440	2318440	When he says we here, he just means Joey.
2318440	2321440	It only takes one person to hit save on a file,
2321440	2325440	and that's the one thing we know for sure Joey did.
2325440	2326440	Like with the money situation,
2326440	2329440	it's hard not to read into why Tommy is talking strangely.
2329440	2332440	It starts to sound like Joey did most of the work,
2332440	2334440	but then that would mean someone else
2334440	2336440	deserves the credit for creating the sound,
2336440	2340440	so all of a sudden this .3 second sound effect
2340440	2341440	becomes a team effort.
2341440	2344440	That's Tommy's version of how the sound was made.
2344440	2346440	He says we, but sometimes when he says we,
2346440	2349440	he just means Joey, so what's Joey's version?
2349440	2352440	Joey's been pretty quiet about all this,
2352440	2353440	and good for him.
2353440	2355440	His career's still going strong,
2355440	2356440	unlike some people's,
2356440	2358440	and I'm sure he has better things to do
2358440	2360440	than litigate who made an ancient sound effect,
2360440	2362440	unlike me who apparently has plenty of time for that shit.
2362440	2364440	However, Kuras does have a website
2364440	2366440	where he maintains credits for every game
2366440	2368440	he's worked on since 1993,
2368440	2370440	and he's still updating it today.
2370440	2372440	Next to Messiah, Joey puts,
2372440	2374440	design of all sound effects.
2374440	2377440	After witnessing someone claim Joey did it,
2377440	2379440	change their mind, delete the story,
2379440	2381440	and then talk in very vague terms
2381440	2382440	about who did what,
2382440	2384440	seeing someone just say,
2384440	2385440	I designed all the sound effects
2385440	2387440	is like a breath of fresh air.
2387440	2389440	This is another reason why I find Tommy's first version
2389440	2391440	of the story more believable.
2391440	2393440	Not only is it untainted by his later discovery
2393440	2394440	how popular the sound was,
2394440	2396440	it's also what the other person
2396440	2397440	who worked on the game said,
2397440	2399440	but this really makes it look like
2399440	2401440	Tommy's stealing credit from someone else
2401440	2402440	who worked for him now.
2402440	2403440	It was just a hunch before,
2403440	2405440	but now, I dunno.
2405440	2407440	And here's when the fun, easy video
2407440	2410440	about the Roblox oof I was trying to make ended
2410440	2412440	and the horror of my new life began
2412440	2414440	because while I was on Joey's page,
2414440	2415440	I noticed something else.
2415440	2417440	Design of all sound effects
2417440	2419440	for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
2419440	2421440	This was very confusing to read
2421440	2423440	because Tommy spent the last several decades
2423440	2425440	saying he worked on Pro Skater.
2425440	2426440	Tony Hawk Pro Skater.
2426440	2428440	Tony Hawk Pro Skater.
2428440	2429440	Tony Hawk Pro Skater.
2429440	2430440	Uh, I was on the original
2430440	2433440	Tony Hawk Pro Skater, uh, team.
2433440	2435440	I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team.
2435440	2437440	I'm not saying Tommy didn't work on it.
2437440	2440440	It's just some places seem to disagree with him.
2440440	2443440	Places like the credits of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
2443440	2445440	According to them,
2445440	2447440	someone else did the in-game sound effects.
2447440	2449440	I'll give you three guesses.
2449440	2450440	It was, it was Joey. It was Joey.
2450440	2452440	Although the company he was at is credited as well.
2452440	2454440	It's like they're saying sound effects
2454440	2456440	done by this guy from this company.
2456440	2459440	But Tommy's acting like he personally did it again.
2459440	2461440	I'm starting to feel a bit bad for Joey.
2461440	2462440	Just to kind of add to the mystery,
2462440	2464440	he talks about how small
2464440	2465440	the development team was at the time.
2465440	2468440	To kind of add to the exclusivity of it, I guess.
2468440	2471440	You know, being a part of the original,
2471440	2473440	uh, Tony Hawk Pro Skater team,
2473440	2476440	you know, there's only about maybe 10 or 12 of us.
2476440	2478440	This means very few people exist
2478440	2480440	who could possibly contradict him.
2480440	2481440	How convenient.
2481440	2483440	It does make it even weirder though
2483440	2485440	for such a small team to leave his name
2485440	2487440	out of the credits.
2487440	2489440	I guess Tommy could say his name is in there
2489440	2490440	but only because his company is named
2490440	2492440	Tommy Tallarico Studios.
2492440	2495440	So who is responsible for the sounds in Pro Skater?
2495440	2497440	The guy credited for it or his boss
2497440	2499440	who says he did it now?
2499440	2501440	In an older interview slash house tour,
2501440	2503440	Tommy got a bit more specific.
2503440	2504440	He said he'd buy skateboards.
2504440	2505440	Oh, sorry.
2505440	2507440	I mean we'd buy skateboards.
2507440	2508440	We'd buy skateboards.
2508440	2510440	And then Tommy would help
2510440	2512440	this mysterious other person record the sounds.
2512440	2514440	He says one of the pain sound effects,
2514440	2516440	ironically also a kind of oof,
2516440	2517440	is his actual voice.
2517440	2519440	The actual sound in Tony Hawk
2519440	2522440	that you hear when the guy falls off the skateboard
2522440	2523440	and cracks his head open.
2523440	2524440	Uh, pfft.
2524440	2525440	Ugh.
2525440	2527440	That's me falling off, cracking my head.
2527440	2530440	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
2530440	2532440	So Tommy might have helped with some of the sounds
2532440	2534440	or at least at some point Joey recorded him
2534440	2536440	falling off a skateboard.
2536440	2537440	Strangely though, while he says he was
2537440	2539440	on the Pro Skater team nowadays,
2539440	2541440	at the time things were very different.
2541440	2543440	You see, as I mentioned earlier,
2543440	2545440	Tommy was on a TV show about games
2545440	2547440	while Pro Skater was being made.
2547440	2550440	The thing about journalism is it's usually frowned upon
2550440	2552440	to cover or review a product you helped create
2552440	2554440	without disclosing you worked on it
2554440	2557440	and to his credit, Tommy's very good at this.
2557440	2559440	When he and co-host Victor cover games
2559440	2561440	he was involved with, they make sure to say it.
2561440	2562440	Take Advent Rising,
2562440	2564440	a game he composed a ton of music for.
2564440	2565440	Advent Rising.
2565440	2567440	I'm not gonna comment on any of the music
2567440	2569440	in the game because I am completely biased.
2570440	2572440	This is, and I mean this unironically,
2572440	2574440	ethical gaming journalism.
2574440	2576440	Also, you might have noticed,
2576440	2579440	but Tommy kind of likes to brag about games he's worked on.
2579440	2581440	One time they reviewed an Aladdin game
2581440	2583440	and they brought up that Tommy worked on
2583440	2586440	a different Aladdin games music eight years before.
2586440	2589440	It was a great throwback to the 16-bit platformer days
2589440	2591440	and I know you worked on the original Aladdin game
2591440	2593440	so you must have felt like you were coming home.
2593440	2594440	Deja vu!
2594440	2595440	Yeah.
2595440	2597440	Tommy not only understands disclosure,
2597440	2598440	he loves doing it.
2598440	2600440	If Tommy worked on a game
2600440	2602440	or a game similar to the one being reviewed,
2602440	2604440	you hear about it on this show.
2604440	2606440	So what does it mean when Tommy doesn't say
2606440	2608440	he worked on a game?
2608440	2610440	While Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was being made,
2610440	2612440	it was featured on the show.
2612440	2614440	Tommy interviewed one of the developers.
2614440	2616440	Later, when it came out, Tommy and Victor reviewed it
2616440	2619440	and both gave it a 9.5 out of 10.
2619440	2621440	If Tommy worked on this game's sound effects,
2621440	2623440	he would have said so, wouldn't he?
2623440	2624440	Well, he doesn't.
2624440	2626440	At no point whatsoever in the coverage
2626440	2629440	does Tommy disclose he worked on the game.
2629440	2631440	Tommy behaves like a TV guy
2631440	2633440	interviewing a game developer,
2633440	2635440	which would be a bit weird if he was also
2635440	2636440	on that development team, right?
2636440	2638440	I can only think of a few reasons
2638440	2640440	why Tommy wouldn't mention he worked on the game
2640440	2642440	when he goes out of his way to do so normally.
2642440	2645440	One is he randomly decided not to take credit
2645440	2647440	for something which seems out of character
2647440	2649440	and pretty dishonest considering how hard
2649440	2650440	he promoted the game
2650440	2652440	and he seems to know better than that.
2652440	2653440	The alternative is,
2653440	2655440	while he had helped Joey out a little,
2655440	2656440	Tommy, at the time,
2656440	2658440	didn't consider whatever input he gave
2658440	2660440	big enough to justify telling people
2660440	2661440	he was involved,
2661440	2663440	which is fascinating to me.
2663440	2665440	There is potentially a past version of Tommy
2665440	2667440	who, if he honestly thought about it,
2667440	2670440	would choose not to say he worked on Pro Skater,
2670440	2671440	which is cool of him.
2671440	2673440	However, then Pro Skater went on
2673440	2675440	to be a really famous franchise
2675440	2677440	and it became very cool to say you worked on it.
2677440	2681440	I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team.
2681440	2682440	And over the years,
2682440	2683440	Tommy's story has grown a bit
2684440	2686440	from helping with some of the sounds
2686440	2688440	to, uh, doing all of them.
2688440	2691440	I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team
2691440	2693440	so I did all those, uh, sounds.
2693440	2695440	I was audio director on that.
2695440	2696440	Uh...
2696440	2698440	Wait, now he's saying he was the audio director?
2698440	2700440	He's not even in the credit!
2700440	2702440	Let's quickly look at who did what
2702440	2704440	on games Tallarico Studios worked on.
2704440	2705440	On the vast majority,
2705440	2707440	Tommy is often credited for music
2707440	2709440	but he doesn't do sound effects much.
2709440	2712440	Sound effects, or sound design as it was later called,
2712440	2714440	is usually done by Joey.
2714440	2716440	A game Tallarico Studios worked on
2716440	2718440	almost always has music by Tommy,
2718440	2720440	sound effects by Joey in the credits.
2720440	2722440	Basically, when Tommy and Joey work on games together,
2722440	2724440	it's pretty clear who did what.
2724440	2726440	In fact, in the early 2000s,
2726440	2728440	Tallarico Studios put out a sound effects library
2728440	2730440	you could buy and use in your own projects
2730440	2733440	with over 19,500 sound effects in it.
2733440	2735440	Tommy's the executive producer
2735440	2738440	so I'm sure he was involved in some capacity
2738440	2740440	but three other recorders and editors are credited
2740440	2742440	along with the sound designer.
2742440	2743440	I wonder who it could be.
2743440	2745440	It's Joey. It's always Joey.
2745440	2747440	Joey credits himself as the lead sound designer
2747440	2749440	at Tallarico Studios for 13 years.
2749440	2751440	The thing he did was sound effects.
2751440	2754440	Even on electric playground, Tommy's show,
2754440	2756440	Joey is credited for additional sound effects
2756440	2758440	so maybe Tommy didn't say he did the sound effects
2758440	2761440	on Pro Skater because he knew Joey would see it.
2761440	2763440	Given Tommy's tendency to take games
2763440	2765440	his sound effects guy is credited for
2765440	2767440	and say he did all the sounds,
2767440	2768440	what does that sort of thing mean
2768440	2771440	for his later claims about Messiah and Making the OOF?
2771440	2773440	Well, wouldn't it be funny
2773440	2776440	if Tommy also reviewed Messiah on TV
2776440	2778440	and when he did, he again did not mention
2778440	2780440	he worked on the game?
2780440	2783440	Wouldn't that be very, very funny?
2783440	2785440	Yeah, it is funny. That is what happened.
2785440	2787440	Even funnier, on that same episode,
2787440	2790440	they also reviewed the Dreamcast version of Pro Skater
2790440	2793440	giving Tommy yet another opportunity
2793440	2795440	to say he worked on it, which he didn't.
2795440	2797440	There's starting to be a precedent
2797440	2800440	for Joey doing things, being the one credited for it,
2800440	2803440	Tommy reviewing it and not mentioning he worked on it,
2803440	2805440	and then years later deciding he did.
2805440	2807440	Coming back to how he talks on the stream,
2807440	2810440	we could mean we both worked on this sound,
2810440	2813440	but to be cynical, it can also mean
2813440	2816440	Joey did it while working for me.
2816440	2818440	Messiah is one of the two or so games
2818440	2820440	I could find that Tallarico Studios made
2820440	2823440	where they are both credited for the sound effects at once
2823440	2825440	so potentially Tommy might have been more involved
2825440	2827440	with the sound effects on this than normal.
2827440	2830440	So our candidates are a guy who mostly did music
2830440	2833440	and not sound effects, reviewed the game on television
2833440	2835440	and chose not to say he worked on it,
2835440	2838440	and when he later decided he did and he made this sound,
2838440	2841440	carefully avoided taking credit for anything specific.
2841440	2843440	Um...or the guy credited for sound effects
2843440	2846440	on almost every other game who says he did it,
2846440	2848440	who Tommy said did it before he changed his mind
2848440	2851440	the first time, and whose name is on the file.
2852440	2856440	In conclusion, who knows?
2856440	2858440	Could have been either of them.
2858440	2859440	Maybe it was both.
2859440	2861440	Art is really a collaborative process.
2861440	2863440	Okay, that was written as a joke
2863440	2865440	about how heavily the deck is stacked here,
2865440	2866440	but let's be serious.
2866440	2869440	I haven't found any definitive proof here.
2869440	2872440	I think it's interesting just how much Joey is credited
2872440	2874440	for sound effects everywhere else,
2874440	2876440	and I think it's weird that Tommy didn't really have
2876440	2879440	any specifics to say about what he did on the sound,
2879440	2881440	and I think if he did work on the game that closely,
2881440	2883440	he should have said so when he reviewed
2883440	2884440	the game on television,
2884440	2886440	but none of that is specific proof
2886440	2889440	of who recorded or mastered a specific sound effect.
2889440	2891440	However, given all of this additional context
2891440	2894440	and information, I can say at least for myself
2894440	2896440	that I have some trouble believing Tommy
2896440	2898440	when he says he made the sound,
2898440	2901440	but when you decide something a well-known industry figure
2901440	2903440	like him has said is suspect,
2903440	2907440	you start to ask, well, what else has he said?
2908440	2909440	This guy's been around for decades,
2909440	2911440	and he's said a lot of things.
2911440	2913440	I started investigating some of his other claims.
2913440	2915440	I did it mostly to prove to myself
2915440	2917440	I was just being silly so I could believe him
2917440	2919440	when he said that he made the sound.
2919440	2921440	I wanted to be able to put this to bed
2921440	2922440	and move on with my life.
2922440	2925440	I just couldn't accept that the first American
2925440	2928440	to ever work on Sonic would lie like that.
2928440	2930440	Hey, wait a second!
2930440	2934440	♪♪
2934440	2936440	Yes, Tommy has repeatedly said
2936440	2939440	he's the first American to ever work on Sonic.
2939440	2942440	In fact, I was the very first American
2942440	2946440	to ever be hired by the Sonic team back in the day.
2946440	2947440	Are you serious?
2947440	2948440	Very first American.
2948440	2951440	Yeah, very first American to be hired.
2951440	2956440	One of the first Americans to ever be hired
2956440	2959440	by Sega of Japan for the Sonic team.
2959440	2962440	I was the first American to ever be hired
2962440	2965440	to work on the Sonic the Hedgehog series.
2965440	2967440	But if you don't take Tommy's word for it
2967440	2968440	and do your own research,
2968440	2970440	by which I mean basically Google Sonic for two seconds,
2970440	2972440	you start to see red flags.
2972440	2975440	Sonic was being developed in America as early as 1992
2975440	2978440	when Sonic 2 was being made in California.
2978440	2980440	Americans are all over Sonic's game development
2980440	2981440	since almost the beginning.
2981440	2983440	Which game did Tommy work on anyway?
2983440	2986440	Sonic, uh, some of the, uh,
2986440	2988440	or one of the Sonic games, Black Knight.
2988440	2990440	That might have been in the 2000s.
2990440	2992440	So Tommy was about 20 years late
2992440	2994440	to the party of Americans working on Sonic.
2994440	2996440	Okay, let's be charitable.
2996440	2999440	Maybe he means first American to do music for the series?
2999440	3000440	But if he thinks that,
3000440	3002440	Tommy's been crushing too many 40s.
3002440	3003440	That was terrible.
3003440	3004440	I promise to live and learn from this.
3004440	3005440	Oh, fu-
3005440	3008440	But this first American stuff gets even deeper.
3008440	3010440	There are layers to this shit.
3010440	3012440	One particular American musician,
3012440	3014440	Michael Jackson, was rumored for decades
3014440	3016440	to have worked on Sonic 3.
3016440	3018440	This was seemingly confirmed
3018440	3020440	by Yuji Naka earlier this year, actually.
3020440	3022440	This would make Jackson the first American
3022440	3024440	to do a Sonic soundtrack.
3024440	3027440	Maybe there are some Americans who worked on one earlier?
3027440	3028440	I'm not sure.
3028440	3029440	I'm not deep into Sonic lore.
3029440	3031440	I'm no Heriton Splimby.
3031440	3033440	Now, you could say, well, sure.
3033440	3034440	Maybe that means Tommy is wrong
3034440	3036440	about being the first American.
3036440	3038440	But there's no way he could have known that.
3038440	3039440	We only found out for sure recently.
3039440	3044440	And yeah, to be fair, that would be true.
3044440	3046440	Were it not for the fact Tommy has also been bragging
3046440	3049440	about knowing back in the 90s that Jackson worked on Sonic.
3049440	3051440	So I was really close with the, uh,
3051440	3054440	the Sega folks back in the early 90s.
3054440	3056440	I don't know if it was ever confirmed or not,
3056440	3057440	but, uh, but I can tell you
3057440	3060440	that he did do the music for Sonic 3.
3060440	3062440	This was at a con in 2014
3062440	3065440	before he started saying he was the first American.
3065440	3068440	So either he knew he was lying when he started saying that
3068440	3070440	or he made this shit up too.
3070440	3072440	Which one is the lie?
3072440	3073440	At this point, why not both?
3073440	3075440	I don't trust this story about knowing
3075440	3077440	about Jackson either, frankly.
3077440	3080440	I think he just made up a story to seem involved
3080440	3082440	with another important piece of history.
3082440	3084440	That seems to be his M.O. at this point.
3084440	3086440	This is just one example of what we could
3086440	3088440	charitably call exaggeration,
3088440	3090440	but realistically we call lies.
3090440	3092440	The more I tried to check things Tommy said
3092440	3094440	to prove to myself that any of it was true,
3094440	3096440	the more it all came apart.
3096440	3098440	Okay, so what about the Metroid Prime thing?
3098440	3101440	He said in a bunch of places, including the OOF stream,
3101440	3103440	that he worked on Metroid Prime.
3103440	3106440	Uh, Metroid Prime with Shigeru Miyamoto,
3106440	3109440	uh, worked on that for, uh, for a couple of years.
3109440	3111440	And I worked with him on Metroid Prime,
3111440	3114440	the first one, and we worked together for about,
3114440	3116440	gosh, I wanna say four or five years.
3116440	3118440	Metroid Prime, I worked with that
3118440	3120440	with Shigeru Miyamoto for five years.
3120440	3122440	I worked with Shigeru Miyamoto,
3122440	3124440	the creator of Mario and Zelda,
3124440	3128440	worked with him for five years on, uh, Metroid Prime.
3128440	3130440	He doesn't just say he worked on it, actually.
3130440	3133440	He says Shigeru Miyamoto was a personal huge fan of his work
3133440	3135440	and always wanted to work on a game with him.
3135440	3137440	We always talked about working together.
3137440	3140440	Like, oh, man, I really love all your Mario stuff,
3140440	3143440	and he'd say, oh, man, I love all your stuff that you do.
3143440	3146440	Like, oh, we gotta work together sometime, you know?
3146440	3148440	I don't know if that part of the story is true,
3148440	3151440	but Tallarico Studios was contracted to work on Prime.
3151440	3153440	Not music, by the way. Prime already had a composer.
3153440	3155440	They just did sound effects.
3155440	3157440	That might turn out to be important later.
3157440	3159440	But early in development, Retro cancelled
3159440	3161440	all their other projects to focus on Prime
3161440	3163440	and suddenly didn't need outside help to get the audio done
3163440	3165440	and his contract wasn't renewed.
3165440	3167440	Tommy will confirm this part of the story himself.
3167440	3169440	My contract was coming to an end
3169440	3173440	was around the same time that Retro's projects
3173440	3175440	were all getting cancelled except for Metroid,
3175440	3178440	and they had an internal audio department.
3178440	3180440	So he did work on it, briefly,
3180440	3182440	but again with the exaggeration.
3182440	3184440	For him to be dropped so easily implies Miyamoto
3184440	3187440	wasn't as invested in working with Tommy as he says.
3187440	3189440	Tommy doesn't just say he worked
3189440	3191440	on Prime's sound effects for a bit
3191440	3193440	and Miyamoto was a huge fan though.
3193440	3195440	His story gets way more exotic.
3195440	3197440	He tells people Miyamoto didn't give him
3197440	3199440	any direction or visuals or animations
3199440	3201440	to make sound effects to.
3201440	3203440	He told him to just make what he thought was cool
3203440	3205440	and the development team designed the weapons
3205440	3207440	and animations around his sounds.
3207440	3211440	Give us a bunch of epic weapon sounds
3211440	3213440	and then what we're gonna do
3213440	3215440	is I'm gonna give those to my artists
3215440	3219440	and then they are gonna be inspired
3219440	3222440	by the sounds that you make
3222440	3225440	and we're gonna inspire the art and the thing.
3225440	3227440	Wow, so cool.
3227440	3229440	This is an unprecedented amount of control
3229440	3231440	for an external audio contractor
3231440	3233440	to have over a project.
3233440	3235440	Plus it just doesn't mix very well with the fact
3235440	3237440	he left really early in development.
3237440	3239440	Did Miyamoto change his mind?
3239440	3241440	Why didn't he make Retro keep him on board
3241440	3243440	if he had such an important job?
3243440	3245440	It also doesn't mix with other stories
3245440	3247440	from Retro Studios' actual audio department.
3247440	3249440	He did an interview for ShineSparkers
3249440	3251440	where he told this story about Miyamoto
3251440	3253440	letting him design the weapon sounds first.
3253440	3255440	However, ShineSparkers then went on
3255440	3257440	to interview Clark Wen, Prime's audio lead,
3257440	3259440	who came on board after the other games
3259440	3261440	were canceled and Tommy was gone.
3261440	3263440	Wen is well-respected in the game audio industry.
3263440	3265440	He's worked on a bunch of stuff,
3265440	3267440	including Tony Hawk games, interestingly enough.
3267440	3269440	According to him, they did sound effects
3269440	3271440	the normal way, basing their work off the art
3271440	3273440	and animations. There's something amazing
3273440	3275440	about reading an interview with Tommy
3275440	3277440	where he's blessed to the project
3277440	3279440	with a radical new technique where the sound designer
3279440	3281440	had massive creative control over the game
3281440	3283440	and then going to the interview with Wen
3283440	3285440	where they say, we interviewed Tommy
3285440	3287440	and he said you did this and he goes,
3287440	3289440	that sounds cool but no.
3289440	3291440	Wen says one or two weapon sound effects
3291440	3293440	were done when he got there and he left them
3293440	3295440	mostly untouched, so a few of the sounds
3295440	3297440	in the game are done by Tallarico Studios
3297440	3299440	and they might have been done the way Tommy said
3299440	3301440	but his overall involvement with the game
3301440	3303440	was very small. How small?
3303440	3305440	He left so early in development
3305440	3307440	they forgot he had worked on it
3307440	3309440	by the time the game was done and forgot
3309440	3311440	to put his name in the credits.
3311440	3313440	A bunch of other audio contractors made it in though.
3313440	3315440	They must have kept contracting people
3315440	3317440	after he left and not got him back.
3317440	3319440	Weird. I wonder why. After seeing Tommy
3319440	3321440	repeatedly take credit for the work
3321440	3323440	of people under him, it's kind of cathartic
3323440	3325440	seeing a bunch of other people get credited
3325440	3327440	and for him to be forgotten.
3327440	3329440	However, he's not the only one.
3329440	3331440	Someone's missing from Tommy's version
3331440	3333440	of the story again. Can you guess?
3333440	3335440	In a now-deleted page on his website
3335440	3337440	accessible via the Internet Archive,
3337440	3339440	Tommy wrote about leaving early in development
3339440	3341440	although he still claims he did a lot
3341440	3343440	of the main sound design somehow.
3343440	3345440	Funnily enough, he doesn't say
3345440	3347440	I too much. He says we.
3347440	3349440	I wonder who the other per-
3349440	3351440	It's Joey! It's always Joey!
3351440	3353440	He shared a recent email from Retro's
3353440	3355440	new audio manager to prove he worked
3355440	3357440	on it and he compliments the work
3357440	3359440	Tallarico Studios did but he says
3359440	3361440	it like this.
3361440	3363440	My hat is off to you, Tommy and Joey!
3363440	3365440	It's always Joey!
3365440	3367440	What makes the story even funnier is how,
3367440	3369440	you know, Tommy was on a TV show that reviewed
3369440	3371440	games when Prime came out. Tommy didn't
3371440	3373440	mention he worked on it, which makes sense.
3373440	3375440	He was barely involved but one fascinating
3375440	3377440	thing that hasn't come up yet is Tommy
3377440	3379440	just has terrible taste.
3379440	3381440	JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
3381440	3383440	The characters are incredibly stupid.
3383440	3385440	He complained about Prime's backtracking
3385440	3387440	and scanning system, stuff people
3387440	3389440	love about the game, and absolutely refused
3389440	3391440	to let Victor get a word in edgewise.
3391440	3393440	I had to scan every little thing.
3393440	3395440	There's a great story in there as well.
3395440	3397440	And that's a problem for me. I enjoyed all of that.
3397440	3399440	The worst problem about this game is that-
3399440	3401440	He gave it a 7.5, which
3401440	3403440	according to Metacritic would be the absolute
3403440	3405440	lowest score any remotely professional
3405440	3407440	critic gave it at the time.
3407440	3409440	Even less than the 8 the guy who wrote the text
3409440	3411440	reviews for EP gave it. Tommy was
3411440	3413440	not the biggest fan of this game
3413440	3415440	but now it's universally recognized as a
3415440	3417440	masterpiece, he can't wait to tell you
3417440	3419440	he was a huge part of it. It's kind of
3419440	3421440	fascinating how these two supposed
3421440	3423440	industry professionals each talk about
3423440	3425440	their work. Joey doesn't mention Prime
3425440	3427440	at all on his site. Presumably
3427440	3429440	he doesn't consider his work a large enough part
3429440	3431440	of the finished game to go on a resume.
3431440	3433440	Meanwhile, Tommy talks like he worked
3433440	3435440	hand-in-hand with Shigeru Miyamoto
3435440	3437440	for five years on Metroid Prime.
3437440	3439440	Oh, come on, H1. Be reasonable. He doesn't say
3439440	3441440	it like that. No, he says it like that.
3441440	3443440	I worked hand-in-hand with Shigeru
3443440	3445440	Miyamoto for five years on Metroid
3445440	3447440	Prime. But he said on his own
3447440	3449440	website he left early. He left
3449440	3451440	so early they forgot to put him in
3451440	3453440	the credits. He knows he's not telling
3453440	3455440	the truth when he says this. Okay, look,
3455440	3457440	maybe I'm just a gaming racist
3457440	3459440	but is it okay at this point to
3459440	3461440	call this an obvious lie? It must
3461440	3463440	be very difficult to work hand-in-hand
3463440	3465440	with someone on a game they famously did
3465440	3467440	not work on very much. Retro Studios
3467440	3469440	is based in Texas. Miyamoto
3469440	3471440	was a distant producer who occasionally
3471440	3473440	gave notes. Several former
3473440	3475440	retro employees have even suggested he
3475440	3477440	gave Metroid to a new company in America
3477440	3479440	that hadn't made any games yet because he didn't
3479440	3481440	like Metroid that much. Some insinuating
3481440	3483440	he didn't really get Metroid's
3483440	3485440	type of gameplay. Miyamoto pawned off
3485440	3487440	IPs like this repeatedly, actually.
3487440	3489440	He visited Rare one day and made them turn
3489440	3491440	a game they were making into a Star Fox game
3491440	3493440	because he had no idea what else to do
3493440	3495440	with Star Fox and we all know how that
3495440	3497440	turned out. It's actually pretty good. People are
3497440	3499440	just mean. Prime is great but it happened
3499440	3501440	because Miyamoto outsourced an IP he didn't
3501440	3503440	like to a bunch of Americans so he didn't
3503440	3505440	have to think about it, which gives very different
3505440	3507440	implications to Miyamoto asking
3507440	3509440	Tommy to do the sound effects. So now
3509440	3511440	almost every game he's bragged about working on
3511440	3513440	has turned out to be a gross exaggeration.
3513440	3515440	The only other games he talks about are
3515440	3517440	Earthworm Jim and Aladdin. I guess
3517440	3519440	there's one more. Uh, Guitar Hero.
3519440	3521440	Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero,
3521440	3523440	uh, franchise.
3523440	3525440	Uh, did some work on
3525440	3527440	some of the, uh, the first three
3527440	3529440	Guitar Hero games? You know, like some
3529440	3531440	of the games I've worked on. Disney's Aladdin,
3531440	3533440	Earthworm Jim, Guitar Hero.
3533440	3535440	Any of his songs on the soundtrack?
3535440	3537440	Uh, no. Did he do sound effects?
3537440	3539440	It doesn't look like it. Is he credited
3539440	3541440	on any of the games? On one of them,
3541440	3543440	yeah. According to a Joystick interview,
3543440	3545440	rest in peace comrade, he helped them
3545440	3547440	get an Aerosmith song on too because
3547440	3549440	his cousin is Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.
3549440	3551440	He's in the credits of Guitar Hero
3551440	3553440	too in the industry thanks section.
3553440	3555440	His involvement seems, I don't know,
3555440	3557440	kind of small. It's mostly people who
3557440	3559440	championed the first Guitar Hero when it came
3559440	3561440	out. You know, game journalists and celebrities
3561440	3563440	and Wil Wheaton. Interestingly,
3563440	3565440	alongside Brad Shoemaker, Ryan Davis,
3565440	3567440	and of course Jeff Gershman, also in these credits
3567440	3569440	is Patrick Klepek who 15 years
3569440	3571440	later would go on to make him delete a legal
3571440	3573440	threat by asking him a basic question.
3573440	3575440	This is the total extent I can find
3575440	3577440	of Tommy's involvement with the Guitar Hero
3577440	3579440	games, but I must be missing something.
3579440	3581440	The way he brings it up, you'd think he was massively
3581440	3583440	involved. I've worked on the Guitar Hero
3583440	3585440	games, the first
3585440	3587440	three, um,
3587440	3589440	the third one was Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
3589440	3591440	Um, now you know
3591440	3593440	why. I want to assume Tommy was
3593440	3595440	joking there, but at this point I
3595440	3597440	don't know. The more you look at Tommy's weird
3597440	3599440	exaggerations, overstatements
3599440	3601440	of credit, his use of we to
3601440	3603440	mean Joey, the more you see it.
3603440	3605440	It starts to take over your mind.
3605440	3607440	You start to ask yourself if even the stuff he couldn't
3607440	3609440	possibly be lying about is a lie.
3609440	3611440	Like, okay, are those
3611440	3613440	Guinness World Records real?
3613440	3615440	I assumed even if everything else was fake,
3615440	3617440	they would be real at least. There's no way
3617440	3619440	anyone could get away with such an obvious
3619440	3621440	lie. It would be too easy to check, but it turns
3621440	3623440	out if something is easy to check,
3623440	3625440	no one actually does.
3625440	3627440	["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
3627440	3629440	["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
3629440	3631440	["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
3631440	3633440	["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
3633440	3635440	Let's start with the big one. The person
3635440	3637440	who has worked on the most video games in their
3637440	3639440	lifetime.
3639440	3641440	That's what he calls it, at least.
3641440	3643440	I hold the Guinness world record for the
3643440	3645440	person who's worked on the most video games in their
3645440	3647440	life. My mother's very proud.
3647440	3649440	The person who's worked on the most video
3649440	3651440	games in their lifetime. My mother
3651440	3653440	is very proud for the person who's worked on
3653440	3655440	for the person who's worked on the most video games in their lifetime.
3655440	3657440	So that was pretty cool. My mother's very
3657440	3659440	proud for the person who's worked on
3659440	3661440	the most video games in their
3661440	3663440	lifetime, which is kinda, kinda crazy.
3663440	3665440	Kind of a cool honor. My mother
3665440	3667440	is very proud. The person who's worked
3667440	3669440	on the most video games in their life.
3669440	3671440	Yeah, my, uh...
3671440	3676440	My mother is very proud.
3676440	3678440	There's several problems
3678440	3680440	with this one. Let's start with how the number
3680440	3682440	of games he's worked on keeps expanding
3682440	3684440	and not in the sexy way.
3684440	3686440	By the time of his first Guinness world record in
3686440	3688440	2008, he'd worked on the production of
3688440	3690440	272 games. Around
3690440	3692440	this time, he stopped doing music for games
3692440	3694440	and started focusing on Video Games Live.
3694440	3696440	Video Games Live takes up such a huge
3696440	3698440	part of your time and your career,
3698440	3700440	so have you ever considered going
3700440	3702440	back to, like, full-time video game composing?
3702440	3704440	No. There was this period
3704440	3706440	in the early 2010s where the last game
3706440	3708440	he'd officially worked on outside of
3708440	3710440	Super Tofu Boy was Sonic and the Black Knight.
3710440	3712440	The last game I composed for was
3712440	3714440	actually a Sonic game, and that was a couple
3714440	3716440	years ago, but yeah. But somehow, two years
3716440	3718440	later, he had a record with over 300
3718440	3720440	games on it. In October 2017,
3720440	3722440	he said he'd worked on over 300 games.
3722440	3724440	In fact, I have a Guinness world record
3724440	3726440	for the person who's worked on the most video
3726440	3728440	games in their lifetime. Over 300 games.
3728440	3730440	But by the time of the OOF stream in January
3730440	3732440	2020, just over two
3732440	3734440	years later, it was over 350.
3734440	3736440	And, uh, I've worked on
3736440	3738440	over 350
3738440	3740440	video games. He had a busy
3740440	3742440	couple of years there. I read today
3742440	3744440	300 video
3744440	3746440	games you've had your hands in.
3746440	3748440	That can't be a real number. That's actually
3748440	3750440	350. Yeah, it's up to
3750440	3752440	350 now. That I know a lot
3752440	3754440	of people in the industry.
3754440	3756440	I've worked on 200, uh, 350
3756440	3758440	games in my career. Okay, Tommy
3758440	3760440	seems a little confused himself how many
3760440	3762440	he's done, so, you know, just for his
3762440	3764440	sake, we should probably double check how
3764440	3766440	many. So, uh,
3766440	3768440	is there a list somewhere? His Wikipedia
3768440	3770440	page lists far less games than
3770440	3772440	he says he's worked on. Fewer.
3772440	3774440	God damn it. I used Wikipedia for that visual
3774440	3776440	earlier showing the games he'd worked on in the early
3776440	3778440	2010s. Let's show everything else he did
3778440	3780440	afterwards. Nothing. He cameoed
3780440	3782440	in Retro City Rampage and that's it according
3782440	3784440	to Wikipedia. His IMDB splits
3784440	3786440	his credits into a dozen different
3786440	3788440	categories but not games, television
3788440	3790440	and movies because it's a horrible website,
3790440	3792440	and the composer and sound department credits have
3792440	3794440	a bunch of games repeated in both.
3794440	3796440	Wow.
3796440	3798440	He's credited for some of them three times.
3798440	3800440	Even Messiah's in there twice.
3800440	3802440	Earthworm Jim 2's in there
3802440	3804440	four times? But even adding literally
3804440	3806440	all the video game credits together
3806440	3808440	including all the duplicates, you get
3808440	3810440	less than half the number he said he'd done
3810440	3812440	15 years ago. What
3812440	3814440	the fuck is happening? His Moby Games page
3814440	3816440	lists about 100? Uh,
3816440	3818440	it's 6.13 AM right now
3818440	3820440	and my eyes went a bit blurry while I was counting.
3820440	3822440	It could be like 98. Either way,
3822440	3824440	it's a lot less than 350 and I'm not
3824440	3826440	recounting this shit. And that's counting a bunch
3826440	3828440	he's just in the thanks for like Guitar Hero 2.
3828440	3830440	He doesn't list Pro Skater because
3830440	3832440	he's not in the credits for that even though Moby
3832440	3834440	Games appear to have copy-pasted the official
3834440	3836440	biography from his website which claims he
3836440	3838440	did. They somehow managed to get Pro Skater
3838440	3840440	to link to the correct game page
3840440	3842440	but not to get the spelling right.
3842440	3844440	Okay, none of these websites can be trusted.
3844440	3846440	Thankfully, Tommy has taken it upon himself
3846440	3848440	to make his own list of games on his website.
3848440	3850440	This list is larger and I mean
3850440	3852440	a lot larger than the others
3852440	3854440	and since Tommy wrote it, there's some
3854440	3856440	dubious names on here. Pro Skater
3856440	3858440	and Guitar Hero are on there and so is Metroid
3858440	3860440	Prime. Obviously, he personally held
3860440	3862440	hands with the development team while they made it
3862440	3864440	but so is Prime 2, a game I've never
3864440	3866440	seen any mention of him touching anyone's
3866440	3868440	hands on. Did they reuse some sounds
3868440	3870440	him slash Joey made?
3870440	3872440	So that counts as working on both?
3872440	3874440	And I guess I can now add Roblox
3874440	3876440	to that list of games.
3876440	3878440	If Tommy thinks he can put Roblox
3878440	3880440	on the list of games he has worked
3880440	3882440	on...
3882440	3884440	imagine what justifications other
3884440	3886440	games are on this list for. One of Tommy's
3886440	3888440	actually interesting contributions to game
3888440	3890440	history is early PlayStation 1
3890440	3892440	models came with a demo disc to show what the
3892440	3894440	console could do and some of his music
3894440	3896440	is in the menus and titles. The first
3896440	3898440	sounds ever made by some early
3898440	3900440	PlayStations would be music made by Tommy.
3900440	3902440	This is kind of neat and cool
3902440	3904440	and it's also weird seeing
3904440	3906440	PlayStation demo disc in a list
3906440	3908440	of games composed for. In general,
3908440	3910440	this list has quite a bit of what we
3910440	3912440	call padding. Tallarico Studios
3912440	3914440	did additional music for the first
3914440	3916440	Blood Rain so that's one game
3916440	3918440	worked on, right? Well, it's on Tommy's list
3918440	3920440	five times as each console version
3920440	3922440	along with PC and Mac.
3922440	3924440	I'm not sure why you'd wanna give Blood Rain such a
3924440	3926440	strong presence on your resume but
3926440	3928440	each to their own. He also did the music for
3928440	3930440	Earthworm Jim 1 and 2.
3930440	3932440	An Earthworm Jim game is on his list
3932440	3934440	18 times!
3934440	3936440	Super Tofu Boy, a free Flash game
3936440	3938440	Peter made he donated music to
3938440	3940440	is on here twice! You can run
3940440	3942440	Flash games on the Mac too? Wow,
3942440	3944440	that's an extra game worked on.
3944440	3946440	Fuck you, Tommy! But even counting
3946440	3948440	all of this, all the games he wasn't credited
3948440	3950440	for but still puts on his list,
3950440	3952440	the multiple times the same game is counted
3952440	3954440	across many different consoles or
3954440	3956440	computers or demo discs
3956440	3958440	as specific games worked on,
3958440	3960440	it's still a lot less than
3960440	3962440	the number he says. If you decide
3962440	3964440	to be a bit mean and remove all the repeat
3964440	3966440	games, you get around 175.
3966440	3968440	Almost 100 less than his
3968440	3970440	first Guinness World Record said
3970440	3972440	15 years ago. So either
3972440	3974440	he stopped updating his website and
3974440	3976440	IMDB, MobyGames, Wikipedia
3976440	3978440	and everywhere else also stopped tracking
3978440	3980440	the games he worked on or
3980440	3982440	Bob, forgive me, the first American
3982440	3984440	to ever work on Sonic is
3984440	3986440	exaggerating again. In an interview in 2010,
3986440	3988440	he said he worked on
3988440	3990440	280 video games, which is a Guinness
3990440	3992440	World Record. Actually inside
3992440	3994440	the Guinness Book as the person who worked
3994440	3996440	on the most video games in their life.
3996440	3998440	This sentence almost
3998440	4000440	made me cut my fucking head off.
4000440	4002440	Tommy isn't actually inside
4002440	4004440	the Guinness Book of World Records he's talking about
4004440	4006440	here. Trust me, I checked.
4006440	4008440	He is, however, inside that year's
4008440	4010440	Guinness Book of World Records
4010440	4012440	Gamer's Edition. The Gamer's Edition
4012440	4014440	is full of more game-centric records.
4014440	4016440	Notice that it's also much smaller
4016440	4018440	and the print quality is much worse and
4018440	4020440	generally it's a lot less prestigious than being in
4020440	4022440	the actual book. My producer,
4022440	4024440	Kat, left a comment on that line in the
4024440	4026440	script saying, it's a bit like saying you gave a
4026440	4028440	TED talk when really you just gave a TEDx
4028440	4030440	talk, not realizing how fucking
4030440	4032440	funny she was being because
4032440	4034440	Tommy has done a TEDx talk.
4034440	4036440	My mother's very proud. When his biography
4036440	4038440	on his website calls it a TED
4038440	4040440	talk. He is exactly that guy.
4040440	4042440	She is so cool. I
4042440	4044440	love her. Tommy is at least featured
4044440	4046440	in the Gamer's Edition. It's a two-page interview
4046440	4048440	about his career and video games live.
4048440	4050440	At the beginning of the interview, the author
4050440	4052440	claims Tommy has worked on more
4052440	4054440	game soundtracks than anyone else.
4054440	4056440	They don't say how they verified this
4056440	4058440	or provide the list of games.
4058440	4060440	It seems a bit like Tommy just told
4060440	4062440	the interviewer this in the interview
4062440	4064440	and they repeated it as a factoid assuming
4064440	4066440	it was true because why would
4066440	4068440	someone tell such an obvious lie?
4068440	4070440	Whatever evidence he has backing up his claim
4070440	4072440	is becoming difficult to find. Luckily
4072440	4074440	this wasn't too expensive on eBay.
4074440	4076440	Uh, supplies are quite low but
4076440	4078440	the demand...it's just me
4078440	4080440	basically. I mentioned how surprisingly cheap these
4080440	4082440	were to Mandalore Gaming and he started bulk
4082440	4084440	buying them to leave in Airbnbs he
4084440	4086440	stays in, like a sort of gamer-dian
4086440	4088440	Bible. So if they seem
4088440	4090440	more expensive now it's because he's artificially
4090440	4092440	inflated the price. Speaking of
4092440	4094440	artificial inflation, even if the amount
4094440	4096440	of games Tommy says he's worked on
4096440	4098440	was completely true, there are
4098440	4100440	still people who've worked on way more games.
4100440	4102440	The record is just wrong.
4102440	4104440	Even Guinness at some point recognized
4104440	4106440	this. They actually changed the
4106440	4108440	wording of the record at some point after
4108440	4110440	he first got it. It's not person who
4110440	4112440	has worked on the most games in a lifetime
4112440	4114440	anymore. It's most prolific
4114440	4116440	composer of game soundtracks.
4116440	4118440	The Guinness website says that now and
4118440	4120440	the updated versions of Tommy's plaque
4120440	4122440	say that too. So Guinness have done their
4122440	4124440	best to correct this mistake.
4124440	4126440	Tommy, however, has continued using the original
4126440	4128440	name anyway for over a decade.
4128440	4130440	In fact, I own the Guinness
4130440	4132440	world record for the person who's worked on
4132440	4134440	the most video games in their lifetime.
4134440	4136440	My mother's very proud.
4136440	4138440	Another one of those sweet little lies we've
4138440	4140440	become accustomed to Tommy using.
4140440	4142440	Although I can kind of understand this one
4142440	4144440	because the new name is even more
4144440	4146440	obviously a lie. I know for a fact
4146440	4148440	Tommy has not made 280
4148440	4150440	video game soundtracks.
4150440	4152440	We need to acknowledge just how bonkers this clip is.
4152440	4154440	He's saying most video games in a
4154440	4156440	lifetime while showing footage of
4156440	4158440	the new record with a different name.
4158440	4160440	Bonus points for the fact the record says more
4160440	4162440	than 300 games but then it cuts to
4162440	4164440	a list he wrote with less than 300
4164440	4166440	games on it. And just in case it needs to
4166440	4168440	be said, no, Guinness are not a real record
4168440	4170440	keeping organization. They're a novelty
4170440	4172440	book company. It's already a pretty
4172440	4174440	common joke that most of their records
4174440	4176440	are just silly stuff someone made up so
4176440	4178440	they can have a record. Like,
4178440	4180440	most baseball bats broken
4180440	4182440	in one minute. That's a silly one
4182440	4184440	I just made up now. Just kidding. It's real.
4184440	4186440	I don't really mind if Guinness track a bunch of
4186440	4188440	silly records. It's just a
4188440	4190440	bit of fun really, but they are an utterly
4190440	4192440	for-profit organization.
4192440	4194440	Not just in terms of sales of books
4194440	4196440	but also sales of records.
4196440	4198440	Guinness has an entire subsection on their
4198440	4200440	website dedicated to business marketing
4200440	4202440	solutions, promising they can help with
4202440	4204440	PR and marketing campaigns, complete
4204440	4206440	with a case studies section showing over a
4206440	4208440	dozen pages of companies they got attention
4208440	4210440	for by helping them come up with a new record
4210440	4212440	to break, like Canon with its
4212440	4214440	longest digitally printed photograph.
4214440	4216440	If you have the money, you can pay them
4216440	4218440	to help you break a record. I have my
4218440	4220440	suspicions a lot of the silly record holders
4220440	4222440	are independently wealthy people. You know,
4222440	4224440	some people just want a record to call their own
4224440	4226440	to give their empty lives a sense
4226440	4228440	of meaning. Guinness aren't purposefully keeping
4228440	4230440	track of who's broken the most bats
4230440	4232440	or wasted the most money on a Pokemon
4232440	4234440	card. Having a Guinness adjudicator
4234440	4236440	on site to verify and give out the
4236440	4238440	award on the day is super expensive.
4238440	4240440	At minimum, $10,000
4240440	4242440	plus transport and hotel costs.
4242440	4244440	This stuff gets expensive fast.
4244440	4246440	They aren't a neutral party tracking human
4246440	4248440	achievements. They are a paid service
4248440	4250440	and many of their record holders are basically
4250440	4252440	just customers. You'll notice
4252440	4254440	that when it became clear someone else
4254440	4256440	should have the record for most games made in a
4256440	4258440	lifetime, they didn't give someone else
4258440	4260440	the record. They changed it to one
4260440	4262440	Tommy was more likely to have. I'm
4262440	4264440	curious how much they charge for this service.
4264440	4266440	Guinness' record search function claims
4266440	4268440	Tommy is involved with two more. These are
4268440	4270440	for video games live. What great marketing
4270440	4272440	these must have been. They are most video
4272440	4274440	game concerts performed and
4274440	4276440	largest audience for a live video game
4276440	4278440	music concert. Let's quickly appreciate
4278440	4280440	how sneaky these records are.
4280440	4282440	VGL haven't come close to
4282440	4284440	performing the most concerts, but
4284440	4286440	for most video game concerts,
4286440	4288440	now that's a record, and it's highly
4288440	4290440	specific so no one can challenge it.
4290440	4292440	In fact, you literally can't challenge it.
4292440	4294440	The Guinness website says these records are not
4294440	4296440	accepting active submissions. This is
4296440	4298440	a special record only Tommy
4298440	4300440	can get. And wouldn't you believe it?
4300440	4302440	At his 357th concert, one of
4302440	4304440	those prohibitively expensive adjudicators
4304440	4306440	turned up to hand him the latest version
4306440	4308440	of these two records, but let's look
4308440	4310440	closer at largest audience for a live
4310440	4312440	video game music concert for a second.
4312440	4314440	Uh, the biggest symphony show
4314440	4316440	ever seen live. Over
4316440	4318440	752,000
4318440	4320440	people watching us
4320440	4322440	live in Beijing, China. This
4322440	4324440	would be pretty impressive.
4324440	4326440	Would you be shocked
4326440	4328440	if I told you Tommy's story is inaccurate?
4328440	4330440	Not all of those 752,000
4330440	4332440	people were watching in person
4332440	4334440	in Beijing. Some of them were watching it
4334440	4336440	digitally on a live stream on a Chinese
4336440	4338440	video website. Biggest symphony show
4338440	4340440	ever seen live. 752,000
4340440	4342440	people
4342440	4344440	watching me live on stage.
4344440	4346440	That was in Beijing. It's a bit deceptive
4346440	4348440	to say they were watching you live
4348440	4350440	on stage when they were nowhere
4350440	4352440	near the stage. How many people were actually
4352440	4354440	there? Uh, the famous
4354440	4356440	um, uh,
4356440	4358440	Bird's Nest National Olympic Stadium.
4358440	4360440	We played there. 130,000 people
4360440	4362440	inside. 600,000
4362440	4364440	people outside. I love that he says
4364440	4366440	outside when he means we're watching
4366440	4368440	a live stream. Like, is he trying to imply
4368440	4370440	that hundreds of thousands of people stood
4370440	4372440	outside just to hear his show?
4372440	4374440	But 100K people attending a concert
4374440	4376440	is still a lot.
4376440	4378440	Still alive-o! You know, I couldn't help
4378440	4380440	but overhear what venue he said
4380440	4382440	this took place at. Bird's Nest
4382440	4384440	National Olympic Stadium. The Bird's Nest is
4384440	4386440	a beautiful stadium, and it must be amazing
4386440	4388440	to play in front of 130,000
4388440	4390440	people there. In case you're not familiar
4390440	4392440	with the Bird's Nest, allow me to read you
4392440	4394440	the beginning of its Wikipedia page.
4394440	4396440	You're an hour deep into a video about the Roblox oof.
4396440	4398440	I don't have anything better to do.
4398440	4400440	The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest,
4400440	4402440	is an 80,000 capacity
4402440	4404440	stadium in Beijing.
4404440	4406440	I think I might have noticed
4406440	4408440	a very small discrepancy.
4408440	4410440	During the 2008 Olympics, it hit its record
4410440	4412440	attendance of 89,000 people.
4412440	4414440	Tommy is claiming he got better
4414440	4416440	attendance than the Olympics and can
4416440	4418440	fold space, but because it's Tommy,
4418440	4420440	there are layers of mistruth happening here.
4420440	4422440	You see, Tommy has the name of the venue
4422440	4424440	wrong. Guinness has an article about
4424440	4426440	his record, and they say it was set at the
4426440	4428440	Beijing Exhibition Theater, which is a
4428440	4430440	different place. At first, I thought this
4430440	4432440	was just a one-off mistake. VGL
4432440	4434440	have played both venues, but the thing
4434440	4436440	is, though, he always says it's the
4436440	4438440	Bird's Nest. Uh, there was the Bird's Nest
4438440	4440440	in China, Beijing National
4440440	4442440	Olympic Stadium, 750,000
4442440	4444440	people. Now, maybe he just has
4444440	4446440	the names really mixed up in his head. They are
4446440	4448440	both in Beijing, after all, although it is
4448440	4450440	a bit weird to forget where you set
4450440	4452440	your Guinness world record, but whatever.
4452440	4454440	But is there maybe a reason he
4454440	4456440	says the name of this theater while claiming
4456440	4458440	he played to hundreds of thousands of people?
4458440	4460440	Well, there's one.
4460440	4462440	It would be even more impossible to play to
4462440	4464440	130,000 people at a theater
4464440	4466440	with only 2,700 seats.
4466440	4468440	The Guinness article also
4468440	4470440	happens to mention the actual number
4470440	4472440	of people physically at the concert.
4472440	4474440	2,086 people.
4474440	4476440	So even when Guinness has the numbers,
4476440	4478440	he still makes shit up.
4478440	4480440	Tommy, anyone can check this.
4480440	4482440	What are you doing? I don't trust that many
4482440	4484440	people were watching the live stream either.
4484440	4486440	There's no easily obtainable record of the live
4486440	4488440	viewership from the Chinese streaming platform
4488440	4490440	this appeared on, so we, and apparently
4490440	4492440	also Guinness, just have to take Tommy's
4492440	4494440	word for it that almost exactly 750,000
4494440	4496440	people watched this live.
4496440	4498440	And considering we just caught him
4498440	4500440	lying about this exact thing,
4500440	4502440	I have my doubts. Even though
4502440	4504440	he has a record with a specific
4504440	4506440	number written on it,
4506440	4508440	the number keeps changing. In an interview
4508440	4510440	in the 2017 Guinness Book
4510440	4512440	of World Records, the gamers edition
4512440	4514440	of course, he directly claims over
4514440	4516440	a million people saw that show live.
4518440	4520440	I cannot stress this enough.
4520440	4522440	He is literally lying
4522440	4524440	to Guinness
4524440	4526440	about a record Guinness just
4526440	4528440	gave him.
4528440	4530440	I just can't fucking believe
4530440	4532440	it.
4532440	4534440	I can't fucking
4534440	4536440	believe it. That's all three
4536440	4538440	of the records Guinness appears to have on file
4538440	4540440	for Tommy Tallarico. Tommy seems
4540440	4542440	to know better though. His list of awards
4542440	4544440	on his website says he has four,
4544440	4546440	the fourth one being most video
4546440	4548440	game concerts in a year, a record
4548440	4550440	I cannot find anywhere other than
4550440	4552440	his list of awards and other interviews
4552440	4554440	with Tommy, so I don't know. Maybe
4554440	4556440	he has four. Well, his biography says
4556440	4558440	he currently holds five, so I don't know.
4558440	4560440	The numbers just keep going up.
4560440	4562440	Can he at least get the record straight
4562440	4564440	on the number of records?
4564440	4566440	Okay, to be fair, he has recently
4566440	4568440	updated it. Lately, he started
4568440	4570440	saying he has...
4570440	4572440	seven.
4572440	4574440	Um, I have seven. Seven Guinness world
4574440	4576440	records for different things.
4576440	4578440	So what are all the others? You know, for a guy
4578440	4580440	who, let's be frank, fucking
4580440	4582440	loves bragging about all the shit he's done...
4582440	4584440	I've worked with everybody.
4584440	4586440	I was the first American...
4586440	4588440	Tommy is uncharacteristically modest about
4588440	4590440	saying what these other four records are.
4590440	4592440	In a Reddit AMA a few years back,
4592440	4594440	he said he has seven, but just to avoid
4594440	4596440	wasting people's time, he only listed three of them.
4596440	4598440	Would you like to guess which three?
4598440	4600440	When someone directly asks him to list
4600440	4602440	the records, he sheepishly adds
4602440	4604440	most game concerts in a year, but that's it.
4604440	4606440	The others are like ghosts.
4606440	4608440	Tommy, how many Guinness world
4608440	4610440	records do you have?
4610440	4612440	Um, that's... so I have seven.
4612440	4614440	Um...
4614440	4616440	one of the ones I have is
4616440	4618440	the most symphony
4618440	4620440	shows in a
4620440	4622440	single year, but I would say there's
4622440	4624440	three big ones. The three big ones are
4624440	4626440	most shows,
4626440	4628440	biggest live show ever
4628440	4630440	seen, and then the, um,
4630440	4632440	the most video games. So I have
4632440	4634440	a total of seven, but there's three big ones.
4634440	4636440	He doesn't even have a riddle prepared for this one.
4636440	4638440	He just refuses to tell people.
4638440	4640440	He's so shy all of a sudden.
4640440	4642440	Luckily for us in Tommy's investor
4642440	4644440	videos for the Amico, we can see at least
4644440	4646440	five of them, so let's just take a look and find
4646440	4648440	out for ourselves. In the center we have
4648440	4650440	most prolific composer of soundtracks.
4650440	4652440	Okay, can't verify he's done that many
4652440	4654440	games, but we at least know that one. The two either
4654440	4656440	sides say most video game concerts
4656440	4658440	and largest audience. Those are the three we
4658440	4660440	know he has. Now for the mystery ones.
4660440	4662440	To the right we have the record
4662440	4664440	for the most video game concerts perfo...
4664440	4666440	This is the same record.
4666440	4668440	This is the previous version. This one's from 2014
4668440	4670440	with 293 shows.
4670440	4672440	What about the one on the left? The longest
4672440	4674440	video game concert video
4674440	4676440	games live which has performed 260...
4676440	4678440	These are the same three records!
4678440	4680440	It's starting to look like there's a good reason
4680440	4682440	the other four records don't get mentioned much.
4682440	4684440	In one house tour he gave in 2017
4684440	4686440	he has them all laid out on the floor
4686440	4688440	where they appear to have sat for five years now.
4688440	4690440	Look at that dust bunny. And Tommy calls them
4690440	4692440	seven different Guinness World Records.
4692440	4694440	There's seven of them.
4694440	4696440	Uh, seven different Guinness World Records,
4696440	4698440	so... I'm not sure how these can be
4698440	4700440	seven different records if when you pause
4700440	4702440	the video and look, several of them are the same
4702440	4704440	and I think when people get too up close
4704440	4706440	and personal with his records they start
4706440	4708440	to notice this too. In this clip
4708440	4710440	he talks about two of them, ones we know,
4710440	4712440	and then this weird cut happens.
4712440	4714440	That was the first one. That was the first one. Yep.
4714440	4716440	And then, uh, and then the... for the shows
4716440	4718440	and then the... Where is he?
4718440	4720440	I didn't edit that in, I swear.
4720440	4722440	I'd love to know what happened between
4722440	4724440	these two clips. Here's yet another
4724440	4726440	fun fact. Guinness charges separately
4726440	4728440	for the award certificate and the plaque it
4728440	4730440	comes in. They have a unique design they don't
4730440	4732440	change very often and they're pretty expensive.
4732440	4734440	When Tommy got these two in 2014
4734440	4736440	it looks like he just bought two picture
4736440	4738440	frames from a store. I guess when you
4738440	4740440	have so many versions of the same record
4740440	4742440	already you get sick of paying full price
4742440	4744440	for them. I'm not just bringing this up
4744440	4746440	to make fun of him, although I am, but it's
4746440	4748440	actually really useful data. You know how
4748440	4750440	I mentioned Guinness renamed his most
4750440	4752440	games record? In this one tour with the
4752440	4754440	Super Awkward Edit, another funny thing
4754440	4756440	happens. Tommy reads out that record,
4756440	4758440	right? This is, uh, the Guinness
4758440	4760440	World Record for the person who's worked on the
4760440	4762440	most video games in a lifetime.
4762440	4764440	Wow. But because he got a
4764440	4766440	shitty frame for this one, we can
4766440	4768440	check and see the record
4768440	4770440	he's reading from says something else.
4770440	4772440	For the person who's worked on the most
4772440	4774440	video games in a lifetime. Wow.
4774440	4776440	Tommy refuses to acknowledge
4776440	4778440	the new title and pretends it has
4778440	4780440	the old wrong name because it's a
4780440	4782440	bit more prestigious. He's lying
4782440	4784440	about the text of a record he is
4784440	4786440	literally holding in his hands and
4786440	4788440	pretending to read from. This guy's
4788440	4790440	a fucking genius. How has he
4790440	4792440	never been caught? I feel like I'm going
4792440	4794440	crazy. You know how the concert records
4794440	4796440	say video game concerts?
4796440	4798440	If you've been paying attention, you'll notice Tommy
4798440	4800440	always says it's for symphony concerts
4800440	4802440	or symphonic concerts.
4802440	4804440	Biggest symphony show ever seen live.
4804440	4806440	The most symphony shows ever
4806440	4808440	done. Uh, the biggest symphony
4808440	4810440	show ever seen live.
4810440	4812440	Biggest symphony show ever seen live.
4812440	4814440	Tommy knows his video game concert
4814440	4816440	record is extremely stupid and out
4816440	4818440	of embarrassment he calls it something else.
4818440	4820440	Oh, maybe it's not deliberate. Maybe he just got the
4820440	4822440	name wrong. No, I can prove it. Here's a time
4822440	4824440	he does that while pointing at it and
4824440	4826440	pretending to read it. Here's one.
4826440	4828440	Largest audience. Largest audience
4828440	4830440	ever to see a
4830440	4832440	symphonic concert live.
4832440	4834440	752,000 people.
4834440	4836440	We can see what the record says in the
4836440	4838440	previous shot, Tommy. Okay, let's wrap this up.
4838440	4840440	How many records does
4840440	4842440	Tommy have? Through a list of games
4842440	4844440	that cannot be found but keeps exploding
4844440	4846440	and by making up new definitions of
4846440	4848440	concert, it looks like Tommy has about
4848440	4850440	three but he owns seven plaques of them
4850440	4852440	so he tells people he has seven
4852440	4854440	different Guinness World Records and
4854440	4856440	maybe he does have a most video game
4856440	4858440	concerts in a year one and it's just
4858440	4860440	never visible in shots of his records.
4860440	4862440	Guinness only has three records in their search
4862440	4864440	though. Well, had.
4864440	4866440	Um, I was gonna move on from Guinness
4866440	4868440	at this point but then there was a new development
4868440	4870440	in the search for Tommy's list of games.
4870440	4872440	After looking everywhere for the list
4872440	4874440	of 350 plus games
4874440	4876440	Tommy supposedly worked on or I guess
4876440	4878440	composed for now, we realized
4878440	4880440	there was one place that would definitely
4880440	4882440	have one. Guinness themselves.
4882440	4884440	So, we emailed them
4884440	4886440	and by we I mean Kat did it
4886440	4888440	for me, she did all the work.
4888440	4890440	That's what people mean when they say we.
4890440	4892440	They mean someone else did it for me.
4892440	4894440	We worked on the oof sound. Yeah, right.
4894440	4896440	I know this trick, Tommy. We,
4896440	4898440	Kat, asked them what evidence was
4898440	4900440	provided for the record and how it was verified.
4900440	4902440	Guinness were really polite and got back
4902440	4904440	to us very quickly. Here was their response.
4904440	4906440	The record title in question is one of our
4906440	4908440	consultant records which are not
4908440	4910440	open to standard applications.
4910440	4912440	They are confirmed by specialist consultants
4912440	4914440	that we approve.
4914440	4916440	Our expert external consultants that
4916440	4918440	we use for records of this kind often have
4918440	4920440	professional links to the field in question,
4920440	4922440	i.e. video games.
4922440	4924440	These titles are research based rather than
4924440	4926440	evidence based. Thanks.
4926440	4928440	First off, this email provides me the incredible
4928440	4930440	quote that the record is not evidence
4930440	4932440	based, which is just fantastic.
4932440	4934440	Thank you very much for that. This is one of the
4934440	4936440	situations where if you did the research,
4936440	4938440	you would have the evidence. This doesn't
4938440	4940440	require specialist consultation.
4940440	4942440	It's a list of games. On top of that,
4942440	4944440	this implies Guinness have never seen a list
4944440	4946440	either. The record was verified
4946440	4948440	by a consultant, so someone
4948440	4950440	somewhere says
4950440	4952440	Tommy has worked on this many games
4952440	4954440	and Guinness believes them.
4954440	4956440	But then, something even
4956440	4958440	stranger happened. Previously, when
4958440	4960440	you typed Tommy's name into Guinness' record
4960440	4962440	search, that record came up.
4962440	4964440	One of the other VGL records came up because
4964440	4966440	he's mentioned by name on that record. The other
4966440	4968440	one doesn't. So those are the ones that came up.
4968440	4970440	This is a screenshot I took in
4970440	4972440	early September. Anyway,
4972440	4974440	after we emailed them asking how they verified
4974440	4976440	it, I realized I needed to take another
4976440	4978440	screenshot because I'd scribbled all over one of them,
4978440	4980440	so I went back
4980440	4982440	and the record didn't come up.
4982440	4984440	Just the other one did.
4984440	4986440	Right after we emailed them asking
4986440	4988440	them where their evidence was
4988440	4990440	and they said they didn't have it,
4990440	4992440	the record disappeared.
4992440	4994440	Did we...did we
4994440	4996440	just get one of Tommy's records deleted?
4996440	4998440	Oh, no!
4998440	5000440	I didn't mean to do this.
5000440	5002440	I just wanted to see a list of games.
5002440	5004440	Tommy, if you're watching this, it wasn't me.
5004440	5006440	It was Cat. Please don't...
5008440	5010440	So now the brakes have come off and this video
5010440	5012440	is spiraling out of my control.
5012440	5014440	We've lost all hope of figuring out
5014440	5016440	what Tommy is doing or why.
5016440	5018440	Doing the early research before
5018440	5020440	this all happened, it got kind of
5020440	5022440	nostalgic going back and re-watching ancient
5022440	5024440	episodes of Electric Playground and
5024440	5026440	reviews on the run and watching Tommy do his
5026440	5028440	wacky boobery and yell at Victor when
5028440	5030440	he says normal things like,
5030440	5032440	Metroid Prime is fun. I was trying to remember
5032440	5034440	if I ever found Tommy funny or if I
5034440	5036440	was always just laughing at him,
5036440	5037440	you know?
5037440	5039440	You know what I gotta say to you?
5039440	5041440	I don't care what you think!
5041440	5043440	After doing that level of research,
5043440	5045440	I fell back into an ancient drama I saw
5045440	5047440	unfold as a kid and completely forgot about.
5047440	5049440	Tommy's awful opinions used to be a running joke
5049440	5051440	on forums discussing his show's reviews.
5051440	5053440	People would bring up he gave Smash Bros. Melee,
5053440	5055440	one of the most beloved games in human history,
5055440	5057440	a 2.5 out of 10.
5057440	5059440	It was a huge running joke.
5059440	5061440	I learned about this because I was a pretty big
5061440	5063440	Mega64 fan as a teenager and they shot some videos
5063440	5065440	at his house and even did an episode
5065440	5067440	of their podcast there. I remember watching this
5067440	5069440	on my iPod Nano on the bus.
5069440	5071440	This was shot just as Smash Bros. Brawl
5071440	5073440	had come out and the gang made fun of his
5073440	5075440	old review as well.
5099440	5101440	Tommy is pointing to the giant model dinosaur
5101440	5103440	he has in his garden.
5103440	5105440	Anyway, it's clear this rumor really gets to him.
5105440	5107440	In an IGN thread about his Mario Galaxy review,
5107440	5109440	this comes up and Tommy T.
5109440	5111440	shows up to defend himself
5111440	5113440	because he Googles his name and has nothing
5113440	5115440	better to do. He claims it's not true
5115440	5117440	but refuses to say what the real score was
5117440	5119440	because he thinks it's fun watching people
5119440	5121440	spout nonsense, so Tommy never
5121440	5123440	gave Melee a 2.5. That's just a rumor.
5123440	5125440	Leave him alone.
5125440	5127440	Here's Tommy's review of Smash Bros. Melee.
5127440	5129440	What do you think about Super Smash Bros. Melee
5129440	5131440	for the Nintendo GameCube?
5131440	5133440	Well, you know, I gotta tell you, it's another GameCube
5133440	5135440	letdown, another GameCube
5135440	5137440	disappointment in my book. 3 out of 10.
5137440	5139440	I give it a 2.5.
5139440	5141440	He said this on TV. People saw him.
5141440	5143440	The footage exists. This isn't speculation.
5143440	5145440	When Tommy does something people criticize
5145440	5147440	him for, even something dumb that doesn't
5147440	5149440	need defending like a video game opinion,
5149440	5151440	he just lies and says he never did it.
5151440	5153440	Like, why would you lie about
5153440	5155440	something so stupid and easy
5155440	5157440	to check? I'm reaching the point where if Tommy
5157440	5159440	says something, it's easier to
5159440	5161440	assume he made it up. His website
5161440	5163440	used to have a page of famous people seen
5163440	5165440	wearing Tallarico Studios T-shirts
5165440	5167440	which is a weird thing to document in the first
5167440	5169440	place but the thing is though, every
5169440	5171440	single picture on it is photoshopped.
5171440	5173440	Like, what was his goal here?
5173440	5175440	What is he even trying to do?
5175440	5177440	Tommy's stratospheric levels of clout
5177440	5179440	chasing have hit a point where I literally
5179440	5181440	can't tell if he's joking. He has a
5181440	5183440	gallery page with pictures of him performing
5183440	5185440	and in magazines and so on and there's a
5185440	5187440	celebrities section showing off all the cool people
5187440	5189440	he's stood next to. Wow.
5189440	5191440	He's really proud of some of them because he keeps
5191440	5193440	reposting them. This Jamie Lee Curtis
5193440	5195440	picture pops up on his Twitter when she's in the
5195440	5197440	news or it's her birthday. She's a wonderful,
5197440	5199440	kind, and talented human being and
5199440	5201440	a fan of my video games live show
5201440	5203440	but one of the pictures on here is really strange.
5203440	5205440	This one is of the Dalai Lama apparently.
5205440	5207440	Before the Amico situation deteriorated
5207440	5209440	to the point he stepped down, he used
5209440	5211440	to post on the Atari Age forums and people
5211440	5213440	were discussing the Amico's Karma gaming
5213440	5215440	engine, a feature Tommy later
5215440	5217440	admitted he made up by the way.
5217440	5219440	During the conversation about Karma, someone
5219440	5221440	referenced the Dalai Lama so of course
5221440	5223440	he reposted that picture and said he met him
5223440	5225440	in London and he liked his music.
5225440	5227440	The issue here is this later turned out to be
5227440	5229440	a wax statue of the Dalai Lama
5229440	5231440	from the Madame Tussauds in London.
5231440	5233440	This is an example of what I've decided to call
5233440	5235440	the Tallarico event horizon.
5235440	5237440	Tommy has lied so much
5237440	5239440	about so many things, I can't
5239440	5241440	even tell if this is meant to be a joke.
5241440	5243440	Is he doing a bit?
5243440	5245440	Is Tommy Tallarico a CIA experiment
5245440	5247440	to see how far you can get in the liberal
5247440	5249440	games industry by just making shit
5249440	5251440	up? Is Tommy Tallarico just
5251440	5253440	a shadow on the wall of a cave?
5253440	5255440	I...I started making
5255440	5257440	this video because I thought a sound effect
5257440	5259440	was funny! I can't tell if he's joking
5259440	5261440	or if he genuinely wants to convince
5261440	5263440	people he met the Dalai Lama. Like I
5263440	5265440	said, this was in a conversation about an Amico
5265440	5267440	feature it turned out he made up.
5267440	5269440	We have something that's called a
5269440	5271440	karma gaming engine
5271440	5273440	and what that means is that
5273440	5275440	everybody, no matter what your
5275440	5277440	skill level, can feel
5277440	5279440	like you have a chance and that you're
5279440	5281440	in the game. I'm interested
5281440	5283440	in the fact that you're using the karma gaming
5283440	5285440	engine. Uh, where, where did that come
5285440	5287440	from? Okay, so the karma gaming
5287440	5289440	engine is just some shit we made up.
5289440	5291440	Okay! Like he literally
5291440	5293440	made it up to get people to invest
5293440	5295440	and admitted it later. Everywhere
5295440	5297440	you look, Tommy is trying to build
5297440	5299440	more prestige in ways that make no
5299440	5301440	sense. Once Tommy had fled the
5301440	5303440	Atari Age forums after calling everyone
5303440	5305440	a gaming racist and stepping down,
5305440	5307440	people started posting about how weird
5307440	5309440	he was being and a guy told a story there
5309440	5311440	about how he ran a display at the Houston Arcade
5311440	5313440	Expo in 2018 showing off old
5313440	5315440	Intellivision stuff right when the Amico
5315440	5317440	had just been announced, so he asked Tommy
5317440	5319440	if he wanted him to put out some business cards
5319440	5321440	advertising the Amico, which he did.
5321440	5323440	His display won an award at the show and
5323440	5325440	mentioned this to Tommy. He allegedly asked
5325440	5327440	him to mail him the award. If this
5327440	5329440	story is true, Tommy just assumed
5329440	5331440	that this award belonged to him.
5331440	5333440	This is just an allegation. Normally
5333440	5335440	I wouldn't bother putting this in the video,
5335440	5337440	but the problem is it tracks so well with a
5337440	5339440	lifetime of taking credit for things he didn't
5339440	5341440	do and making up awards.
5341440	5343440	I find this story too believable
5343440	5345440	not to mention. Still, this doesn't
5345440	5347440	mean Tommy hasn't done good work
5347440	5349440	in the industry or had any legitimate
5349440	5351440	achievements. To properly recognize the good
5351440	5353440	work he's done, we ought to talk about
5353440	5355440	GANG. The Game Audio Network
5355440	5357440	Guild is a group of industry professionals
5357440	5359440	dedicated to improving the craft,
5359440	5361440	helping people network, and recognizing
5361440	5363440	people's achievements with awards.
5363440	5365440	Tommy has won a lot of awards from
5365440	5367440	the Guild over the years, at least 16
5367440	5369440	by my count, and he's clearly very proud
5369440	5371440	of them because he puts them all up next to his
5371440	5373440	Guinness World Records.
5373440	5375440	Tommy Tallarico
5375440	5377440	is also the founder of GANG.
5377440	5379440	Recently, uh, I founded a non-profit
5379440	5381440	organization called the Game
5381440	5383440	Audio Network Guild or
5383440	5385440	GANG. It's really funny seeing
5385440	5387440	Tommy give tours of his house in his GANG
5387440	5389440	t-shirt and of his office with his GANG
5389440	5391440	desktop background and then going to his
5391440	5393440	website and seeing 16 awards from
5393440	5395440	the group he founded and was on the board of directors
5395440	5397440	of at the time. Tommy Tallarico,
5397440	5399440	composer and sound designer
5399440	5401440	for video games, also the
5401440	5403440	president of the Game Audio Network Guild
5403440	5405440	also known as GANG.
5405440	5407440	GANG even gave an award for best
5407440	5409440	sound library to that sound pack he
5409440	5411440	made with Joey's help. They've only given
5411440	5413440	out that award four times in their 20
5413440	5414940	year existence by the way.
5414940	5416940	And again, these are award
5416940	5418940	winning sound effects.
5418940	5420940	At least we know the sounds in the Roblox kit
5420940	5422940	really are award winning. Like, at this
5422940	5424940	point, research for a video that was
5424940	5426940	supposed to be about the Roblox oof
5426940	5428940	has gone so far off course
5428940	5430940	that I needed, like,
5430940	5432940	something that was baseline obviously
5432940	5434940	true to hang on to so I could
5434940	5436940	return to sanity. So
5436940	5438940	I asked myself what I thought
5438940	5440940	would be the most obvious question.
5440940	5442940	Was Tommy even on
5442940	5443940	Cribs?
5443940	5445940	On YouTube, like I said, there's a lot, there's videos
5445940	5447940	of your house and MTV
5447940	5449940	Cribs I was on. It's awesome,
5449940	5451940	right? You did an MTV Cribs?
5451940	5453940	Yeah.
5453940	5455940	Yeah, they were my house. Didn't you have
5455940	5457940	an episode of MTV Cribs back in the day?
5457940	5459940	Yeah! Like he tells
5459940	5461940	people it was Cribs, he uploaded a video
5461940	5463940	to his YouTube channel saying it
5463940	5465940	was Cribs.
5465940	5467940	So was it?
5467940	5469940	No!
5469940	5471940	Cribs is, you know, a TV
5471940	5473940	show. It has lists of
5473940	5475940	episodes. You can just check.
5475940	5477940	It was obviously a lie the
5477940	5479940	entire time. I don't know how no one
5479940	5481940	called him on it. Do gamers just not know
5481940	5483940	what Cribs is? Cribs went
5483940	5485940	to the home of massively successful
5485940	5487940	musicians like Snoop Dogg and Maroon 5
5487940	5489940	or other really big celebrities
5489940	5491940	like Tony fucking Hawk.
5491940	5493940	They did not go to the home of the guy
5493940	5495940	who might have made some of the
5495940	5497940	skateboard sounds for his game.
5497940	5499940	Absolutely no normal person
5499940	5501940	watching MTV in the mid-2000s
5501940	5503940	is gonna know who Thomas the Tallarico
5503940	5505940	engine even is. He did the soundtrack
5505940	5507940	to Earthworm Jim. He's not
5507940	5509940	a celebrity. Nobody gives a shit
5509940	5511940	about his fucking fountain.
5511940	5513940	Waterfall here.
5513940	5515940	Which makes me wanna
5515940	5517940	pee at night, oddly enough.
5517940	5519940	My mother's very proud. Cribs
5519940	5521940	had very specific motion graphics and they
5521940	5523940	always showed the same factoids at the beginning
5523940	5525940	every time, using the same visual.
5525940	5527940	This video just has a wall of text.
5527940	5529940	MTV had a very specific vibe
5529940	5531940	with its backing tracks. This thing uses
5531940	5533940	easily identifiable stock music.
5533940	5535940	So identifiable, YouTube flagged it.
5535940	5537940	But if it wasn't Cribs, then
5537940	5539940	what was it? Someone in the comments says they saw
5539940	5541940	this on a disc that came with a gaming magazine
5541940	5543940	back in the day, but I think they're thinking
5543940	5545940	of the other times he did that. Because
5545940	5547940	Tommy's a massive narcissist, his website
5547940	5549940	has a video section with a meticulous
5549940	5551940	collection of his appearances and links to them
5551940	5553940	on YouTube, some of which he uploaded himself.
5553940	5555940	He links this one and calls it MTV
5555940	5557940	Cribs Here Too, along with two of his
5557940	5559940	PlayStation Magazine appearances. But here's
5559940	5561940	the thing. Tommy's website is ancient
5561940	5563940	and has several much older versions preserved
5563940	5565940	on the Internet Archive. On the version
5565940	5567940	from 2004, before YouTube was a
5567940	5569940	thing, he would just put the videos on his own
5569940	5571940	site. Many of the videos on the old site
5571940	5573940	ended up as links to YouTube videos on the
5573940	5575940	new one. The PlayStation Magazine house tour
5575940	5577940	and interviews are here, along with this around
5577940	5579940	the world in 80 games thing. There doesn't
5579940	5581940	seem to be a Cribs video on the old version
5581940	5583940	of the site, which is a bit of a red flag.
5583940	5585940	Additionally, there's one house tour that didn't
5585940	5587940	seem to make it to the new one, done by
5587940	5589940	GamerTV. The video itself
5589940	5591940	on Tommy's site wasn't archived,
5591940	5593940	but Gamer.TV was a show from the UK
5593940	5595940	about gaming hosted by Sam Delaney.
5595940	5597940	One episode had a feature on ways to make
5597940	5599940	money in the game industry, professional gamers,
5599940	5601940	voice actors, and of course,
5601940	5602940	a certain composer.
5602940	5604940	Hey, I'm Tommy Tallarico, composer
5604940	5606940	and sound designer for video games.
5606940	5608940	Hey, wait a second!
5608940	5610940	Hey, I'm Tommy Tallarico, composer
5610940	5612940	and sound designer for video games.
5612940	5614940	So this episode is using a cut-down
5614940	5616940	version of the footage we saw in Tommy's video.
5616940	5618940	So now we know who really shot
5618940	5620940	this footage. Gamer.TV used
5620940	5622940	to have a website, Gamer.TV.
5622940	5624940	Oh, that's clever. It's down now, but in
5624940	5626940	archives, it's clear the site used to have a video
5626940	5628940	section with extra stuff. One of the extra
5628940	5630940	videos appears to be about a gamer
5630940	5632940	with a Ferrari and a luxury home.
5632940	5634940	I think Gamer.TV met
5634940	5636940	Tommy and toured his house, used
5636940	5638940	clips from this in their show, and uploaded
5638940	5640940	the entire house tour as a bonus feature
5640940	5642940	to their website. The video linked here
5642940	5644940	is sadly not archived either. At least
5644940	5646940	not directly. It was preserved
5646940	5648940	if, say, Tommy downloaded
5648940	5650940	it and put it on his own website and then later
5650940	5652940	moved his video archive to YouTube.
5652940	5654940	This is a kind of cool act of video
5654940	5656940	preservation except for the part where it
5656940	5658940	somehow ended up being called MTV
5658940	5660940	Cribs. How did that happen?
5660940	5662940	I mean, the file on his website
5662940	5664940	was named correctly. This would be
5664940	5666940	a difficult thing to get wrong unless
5666940	5668940	he did it on purpose.
5668940	5670940	It's awesome, right?
5670940	5672940	Is Tommy just, like, a
5672940	5674940	pathological liar? Does he have to
5674940	5676940	lie to sound more interesting no matter
5676940	5678940	what? Like how he went from saying he did
5678940	5680940	some sounds for Prime to saying he worked
5680940	5682940	on it with Miyamoto for five years or how
5682940	5684940	he went from being one of the voices in
5684940	5686940	Pro Skater to the audio director or
5686940	5688940	how he went from doing three songs for Sonic
5688940	5690940	and the Black Knight in 2009 to
5690940	5692940	being the first American to ever get to kiss
5692940	5694940	Sonic on his little mouth? Every time
5694940	5696940	something comes up again, the lie has to get bigger.
5696940	5698940	In that newer house tour I showed,
5698940	5700940	the guy asks Tommy about if it was featured
5700940	5702940	on Cribs and he says it was on there more than
5702940	5704940	once. Tommy Tallarica
5704940	5706940	has invited me to his
5706940	5708940	MTV Crib. This hasn't been on
5708940	5710940	the MTV Crib, right? Uh, a couple times.
5710940	5712940	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why is he like this?
5712940	5714940	Why are you like
5714940	5716940	this? I know you're still watching,
5716940	5718940	Tommy. Explain yourself.
5718940	5720940	What are you doing? What are you
5720940	5722940	fucking doing?
5726940	5728940	So...
5728940	5730940	yeah. Maybe
5730940	5732940	every single thing Tommy
5732940	5734940	has ever said is a lie. Maybe
5734940	5736940	some of it is true, but bear in mind
5736940	5738940	that even if Tommy has
5738940	5740940	lied, that isn't, like,
5740940	5742940	a crime. You can just lie to people.
5742940	5744940	Watch. I am a trained
5744940	5746940	helicopter pilot. See? You can
5746940	5748940	just say things. No one can stop you.
5748940	5750940	However, there are times when lying
5750940	5752940	does become a crime, and Tommy
5752940	5754940	would know this intimately because it cost him
5754940	5756940	$100,000. In 2009,
5756940	5758940	after putting on a video games live event
5758940	5760940	in Brazil, Tommy returned to America
5760940	5762940	with over $100,000
5762940	5764940	in cash on his person. When you
5764940	5766940	enter America with more than $10,000,
5766940	5768940	you have to declare it for money laundering
5768940	5770940	and trafficking reasons. Tommy knew
5770940	5772940	he had to do this, but for some reason,
5772940	5774940	he didn't. His business associate,
5774940	5776940	who was also his brother, filed a customs
5776940	5778940	declaration on their common behalf, denying
5778940	5780940	they were bringing that much money into the country.
5780940	5782940	Tommy knew this was false. When he
5782940	5784940	was caught at a TSA checkpoint with a bag
5784940	5786940	with $100,000 in it, there were some
5786940	5788940	serious questions. He quickly made up
5788940	5790940	a story to explain himself. He told them he
5790940	5792940	didn't need to declare the money because he had
5792940	5794940	distributed it among his band members during
5794940	5796940	the flight in amounts less than $10,000
5796940	5798940	and then took the money back once they
5798940	5800940	were through customs, so no one needed to declare
5800940	5802940	anything. Tommy thought he was being clever,
5802940	5804940	but he had just accidentally confessed
5804940	5806940	to the crime of structuring, where you
5806940	5808940	deliberately avoid regulations by pulling
5808940	5810940	stunts like this. Structuring is a
5810940	5812940	federal felony with huge fines and
5812940	5814940	up to five years in prison attached to it.
5814940	5816940	Later, he came clean and told investigators
5816940	5818940	he lied and made up that story,
5818940	5820940	and actually he just took the money over the border
5820940	5822940	himself, so when I call Tommy a liar,
5822940	5824940	that's not just my opinion. There is
5824940	5826940	also a legal document signed by him
5826940	5828940	admitting to it. Looking deeper into
5828940	5830940	United States v. Tallarico,
5830940	5832940	that's its name. Tommy pled guilty,
5832940	5834940	was placed on probation for a year,
5834940	5836940	forfeited the $102,000 seized
5836940	5838940	by customs, and had to pay a $1,000
5838940	5840940	fine, plus a $25
5840940	5842940	assessment fee.
5842940	5844940	America! There's a really interesting lesson
5844940	5846940	here. In the game industry, you can just
5846940	5848940	lie about what games you worked on,
5848940	5850940	what sounds you made, and whether you worked
5850940	5852940	on cribs, and the only real repercussion
5852940	5854940	is people finding you unpleasant,
5854940	5856940	but if you try that with the TSA while carrying
5856940	5858940	a large, unexplained bag of money,
5858940	5860940	there can be consequences.
5860940	5862940	There are other ways lying can be a crime
5862940	5864940	too. For example,
5864940	5866940	if you lie to potential investors
5866940	5868940	to get their money. During one of Tommy's many
5868940	5870940	attempts to find investors for the Amico,
5870940	5872940	he told the exact kind of Tommy-esque
5872940	5874940	tall tales you would expect from him
5874940	5876940	but in a situation where doing so can get
5876940	5878940	you in serious trouble. In February
5878940	5880940	2021, he recorded this video
5880940	5882940	for potential investors and lists the team
5882940	5884940	of so-called Avengers working at
5884940	5886940	Intellivision, one of whom was Kara Acker,
5886940	5888940	a former marketing manager at Mattel
5888940	5890940	on Disney Princesses and especially Frozen,
5890940	5892940	which would be a great find for the company
5892940	5894940	and thinking she was on board might
5894940	5896940	well have helped convince investors to part
5896940	5898940	with their money. If we scroll slightly higher
5898940	5900940	on her LinkedIn though, we can see she actually
5900940	5902940	left Intellivision...
5902940	5904940	in 2020. But here's Tommy
5904940	5906940	telling people in 2021
5906940	5908940	after she was gone, he has
5908940	5910940	her on board, so you should definitely
5910940	5911940	invest.
5911940	5913940	Our VP of global
5913940	5915940	marketing used to work at Mattel
5915940	5917940	as one of the global
5917940	5919940	brand managers over there, right?
5919940	5921940	And she was in charge of the Disney
5921940	5923940	brand within Mattel, so
5923940	5925940	that's a double bonus there.
5925940	5927940	Um, is there a word for
5927940	5929940	lying to people? For money?
5929940	5931940	If this convinced people to invest,
5931940	5933940	they have grounds to say they were lied to
5933940	5935940	about the status of the company. You can't
5935940	5937940	just pretend people still work for
5937940	5939940	you. On their Republic crowdfunding campaign,
5939940	5941940	which raised $11.5 million,
5941940	5943940	the pitch video for these investors
5943940	5945940	featured Aka heavily in Tommy's
5945940	5947940	disgusting Egypt room as VP of
5947940	5949940	global marketing. She was front and center
5949940	5951940	as one of the intended draws to investors.
5951940	5953940	She was basically the company's pharaoh.
5953940	5955940	She's also still shown on
5955940	5957940	the list of team members, including,
5957940	5959940	ironically, a link to her LinkedIn, which
5959940	5961940	will tell you she's actually gone. This
5961940	5963940	crowdfunding campaign ended in 2021.
5963940	5965940	There was a period of four
5965940	5967940	months minimum where people were investing
5967940	5969940	based on a video and information
5969940	5971940	which was not accurate at the time and
5971940	5973940	never corrected. The Intellivision website
5973940	5975940	listed Aka as VP of global marketing
5975940	5977940	as late as July 2021
5977940	5979940	according to the Internet Archive. Did the
5979940	5981940	guy who ran the website quit too?
5981940	5983940	Investors using this website as a source
5983940	5985940	of information would have a hard time confirming
5985940	5987940	who was actually at the company.
5987940	5989940	People don't give, investors don't give
5989940	5991940	you millions of dollars unless you have hard,
5991940	5993940	cold facts. I certainly hope
5993940	5995940	there's some facts I missed here. People gave
5995940	5997940	this company millions of dollars.
5997940	5999940	Like, seriously, I hope for Intellivision's sake
5999940	6001940	Aka just put the wrong date on her LinkedIn.
6001940	6003940	Well, there's gonna be some questions.
6003940	6005940	In fact, if you click the invest button
6005940	6007940	on the Intellivision website, it takes you
6007940	6009940	to the same video with Aka still in it.
6009940	6011940	You know the Avengers, right? Marvel Avengers.
6011940	6013940	You know, they're the super team of superheroes
6013940	6015940	ready to save the world. Also on
6015940	6017940	Tommy's list of Avengers was Jay Allard,
6017940	6019940	the co-founder of the Xbox and Xbox Live.
6019940	6021940	This would make the company look like
6021940	6023940	it was on the right track and had some really
6023940	6025940	good minds attached to it. However,
6025940	6027940	Allard decided he wasn't a good fit
6027940	6029940	and left the company.
6029940	6031940	In 2020. Here's another one.
6031940	6033940	How about the guy who co-founded
6033940	6035940	and co-created
6035940	6037940	the Xbox, right? When Tommy
6037940	6039940	was saying Allard was on the team in this
6039940	6041940	footage, to get people's money,
6041940	6043940	Allard was already gone.
6043940	6045940	He was gone to such an extent
6045940	6047940	he didn't just change his LinkedIn to say he wasn't
6047940	6049940	at the company anymore. He removed
6049940	6051940	it from his page completely. Allard
6051940	6053940	unworked at Intellivision
6053940	6055940	and after this happened, Tommy
6055940	6057940	was shooting a new video telling people
6057940	6059940	he was in the Amico Avengers.
6059940	6061940	I mean, this guy doesn't even need to work anymore,
6061940	6063940	but he loves our idea
6063940	6065940	and concept so much that
6065940	6067940	he joined the team and has been making
6067940	6069940	huge, huge contributions.
6069940	6071940	This particular comment
6071940	6073940	is incredible because on another
6073940	6075940	investment platform, remember Fig? Tommy
6075940	6077940	had previously bragged about Allard's involvement
6077940	6079940	in that investor video too. He was actually
6079940	6081940	at the company when this one was made
6081940	6083940	at least and Intellivision's share offering
6083940	6085940	documents on Fig also claimed Allard
6085940	6087940	was involved and that he was the global
6087940	6089940	managing director. A while after Allard
6089940	6091940	had left, the SEC noticed
6091940	6093940	Intellivision's Fig was still advertising
6093940	6095940	he was there. Investors were technically
6095940	6097940	being deceived. Also, a major
6097940	6099940	member of staff like the global managing
6099940	6101940	director leaving could be causing
6101940	6103940	problems with making the product they were
6103940	6105940	promising to investors, you know? So
6105940	6107940	they asked Fig what was going on.
6107940	6109940	Orally, someone at a government
6109940	6111940	agency physically asked
6111940	6113940	someone at Fig what the hell was happening
6113940	6115940	at Intellivision. Fig asked Intellivision
6115940	6117940	to clarify. Intellivision panicked
6117940	6119940	and said they would change the documents
6119940	6121940	and product development was unaffected by his
6121940	6123940	leaving because, to quote Fig quoting
6123940	6125940	Intellivision, he has not played a material
6125940	6127940	role in product development
6127940	6129940	considering his contributions.
6129940	6131940	He joined the team and has been making
6131940	6133940	huge, huge contributions.
6133940	6135940	Uh... This is footage
6135940	6137940	of a CEO right before his company
6137940	6139940	tells a major government agency
6139940	6141940	Allard is gone and hadn't made meaningful
6141940	6143940	contributions telling people he's
6143940	6145940	on the team and has been making huge,
6145940	6147940	huge contributions to get
6147940	6149940	their money. I'm not a lawyer.
6149940	6151940	I'm just a helicopter pilot,
6151940	6153940	but I don't think it gets worse
6153940	6155940	than this. You know, this is the kind
6155940	6157940	of thing that's like, really? I mean,
6157940	6159940	talk about a slam dunk. The people
6159940	6161940	working at the company are the main pitch
6161940	6163940	for the Amico. Invest in me.
6163940	6165940	I don't lose. I have the best team.
6165940	6167940	I've been a winner in this industry
6167940	6169940	my whole career. I
6169940	6171940	don't lose, and what
6171940	6173940	I've done is packed our team
6173940	6175940	with other people who are winners.
6175940	6177940	Several of his key team members weren't
6177940	6179940	working there anymore when he recorded
6179940	6181940	this. One of them had even scrubbed it from his
6181940	6183940	LinkedIn. I don't think this is giving potential
6183940	6185940	investors an accurate impression of what they're
6185940	6187940	buying into. This is the exact kind of thing
6187940	6189940	Tommy normally does, but in this context
6189940	6191940	it's really bad, and this brings
6191940	6193940	us to the real question at the center
6193940	6195940	of all this. The big thing we've been avoiding
6195940	6197940	for the last hour while we circle
6197940	6199940	the drain, but we can't avoid it
6199940	6201940	anymore. Did Tommy make
6201940	6203940	the funny baby sound effect?
6203940	6205940	Remember when that was the point of the video?
6205940	6207940	When we look at the sum collective of all
6207940	6209940	of his claims, the Tallarico
6209940	6211940	totality if you will, and we put
6211940	6213940	it in context with, uh,
6213940	6215940	reality, when Tommy says he
6215940	6217940	created the oof, this might just
6217940	6219940	be me, but I don't believe
6219940	6221940	him. Although at this point, if Tommy confessed to
6221940	6223940	a murder, I would assume he was just trying to
6223940	6225940	be cool. I'm sure if I was a more reasonable person
6225940	6227940	I could say the evidence is all inconclusive
6227940	6229940	and Tommy could have worked on the sound
6229940	6231940	maybe, but right now all I
6231940	6233940	know is Tommy is a huge liar, and
6233940	6235940	I hate him, and he made me forget what this
6235940	6237940	video is about!
6239940	6241940	I promise you when I started making
6241940	6243940	this video, my goal was to make something
6243940	6245940	short for once. Take a break from
6245940	6247940	my longer projects to make a quick video
6247940	6249940	quickly so people knew I was
6249940	6251940	alive. I did not expect while I was
6251940	6253940	doing research for a rabbit hole to open
6253940	6255940	beneath my feet and to fall Wile E.
6255940	6257940	Coyote style into an abyss of lies
6257940	6259940	and madness and seemingly getting one of
6259940	6261940	his Guinness World Records sent to the fucking
6261940	6263940	Shadow Realm. I didn't choose this!
6263940	6265940	This happened to me,
6265940	6267940	and I'm not happy about it. I wanted this
6267940	6269940	to be a story about how in our modern age
6269940	6271940	we don't take ownership of artists' work
6271940	6273940	seriously enough through the lens of
6273940	6275940	a sound effect that had been reused without
6275940	6277940	credit for over a decade, but
6277940	6279940	the people not being credited in this story are
6279940	6281940	hard-working folks under Tommy who he
6281940	6283940	has taken credit from over the years
6283940	6285940	and the original voice actor, none
6285940	6287940	of whom will see any of the money Tommy makes
6287940	6289940	from selling their sound today.
6289940	6291940	It is incredibly easy for hard work
6291940	6293940	to be exploited by corporations,
6293940	6295940	and one of those corporations happens to
6295940	6297940	be called Tommy Tallarico Studios
6297940	6299940	Incorporated, but that's really a
6299940	6301940	structural problem, and we already all know
6301940	6303940	capitalism is bad. Statistically, your
6303940	6305940	most formative memories are of a global financial
6305940	6307940	crisis. You don't need that lecture from
6307940	6309940	me. I think the unique lesson of this story
6309940	6311940	is about, well, records
6311940	6313940	in multiple senses of the word.
6313940	6315940	What's really at stake here is history,
6315940	6317940	how these events and people
6317940	6319940	will be remembered. Tommy has cultivated
6319940	6321940	such a reputation that when I asked about
6321940	6323940	the origins of a famous punch sound effect
6323940	6325940	on Twitter, someone independently
6325940	6327940	brought him up and said they assume he
6327940	6329940	must have done it. He seems to have done everything.
6329940	6331940	At least he says he has.
6331940	6333940	The man has successfully inserted himself into
6333940	6335940	conversations about sound effects he didn't even
6335940	6337940	make, while the people who did the work
6337940	6339940	attributed to him evaporate into
6339940	6341940	namelessness. No one knows who Joey
6341940	6343940	Kouros is, and he made the sound effects
6343940	6345940	people think Tommy did. He worked on
6345940	6347940	fucking Fortnite. I've heard his
6347940	6349940	sound effects as they blast my silver
6349940	6351940	surfer into dust. It's not
6351940	6353940	right for him and people like him to be
6353940	6355940	forgotten. Games have always had problems
6355940	6357940	crediting authors correctly. Early
6357940	6359940	games were seen as products first and
6359940	6361940	creative work second, so credit wasn't
6361940	6363940	taken seriously. Creators used
6363940	6365940	to not be allowed to put their name on the game
6365940	6367940	and had to hide them in Easter eggs.
6367940	6369940	Mark Cerny, ironically another good candidate
6369940	6371940	for first American to work on Sonic,
6371940	6373940	wasn't allowed to keep any of his work or design
6373940	6375940	documents when he was working at Atari,
6375940	6377940	and his games were considered Atari creations,
6377940	6379940	not his. His source code,
6379940	6381940	notes, and documentation were only
6381940	6383940	preserved because someone got them out of a dumpster
6383940	6385940	when Atari closed the office and threw
6385940	6387940	it all out. This problem has especially
6387940	6389940	contributed to the perception of women working
6389940	6391940	in games. Yoko Shimomura, one of the
6391940	6393940	most well-known video game music composers
6393940	6395940	today, a veritable industry icon
6395940	6397940	one might say, composed all but
6397940	6399940	three of the tracks on the original arcade
6399940	6401940	version of Street Fighter II, but due to
6401940	6403940	Capcom's crediting policy at the time,
6403940	6405940	she was credited via a pseudonym. For her
6405940	6407940	music's appearance on console releases and
6407940	6409940	updated versions of the game, she was not credited
6409940	6411940	for her compositions at all. All credit
6411940	6413940	was given to the people who translated them to the
6413940	6415940	new formats. Her contributions to game
6415940	6417940	music history are only recognized
6417940	6419940	properly decades afterwards because
6419940	6421940	her early career was rendered invisible,
6421940	6423940	music she wrote often being credited to
6423940	6425940	someone else. This was widespread at
6425940	6427940	the company. The Capcom sound team throughout
6427940	6429940	the 80s and early 90s was almost
6429940	6431940	entirely women. Just think about
6431940	6433940	that for a second. An extremely influential
6433940	6435940	group of female early game
6435940	6437940	composers, all credited through pseudonyms
6437940	6439940	or sometimes not at all, and with the
6439940	6441940	ports of music they composed credited
6441940	6443940	to someone else. Maybe one of the reasons
6443940	6445940	game development is perceived as a male
6445940	6447940	dominated industry is because all the women
6447940	6449940	who've always been here keep getting
6449940	6451940	left out of the history they wrote.
6451940	6453940	If you're interested in the topic, I recommend
6453940	6455940	the Street Fighter Lady and Female Credit
6455940	6457940	by Andy Lemon and Hillegonda Rietveld.
6457940	6459940	I've linked them in the description and plagiarized
6459940	6461940	them heavily in this section of the video,
6461940	6463940	but even when people are credited, the recognition
6463940	6465940	can easily be minimized. Joey did
6465940	6467940	some of the music for the Terminator Sega
6467940	6469940	CD game, but as you can imagine, this
6469940	6471940	information has been rendered obscure thanks to
6471940	6473940	a much larger musician making sure his name
6473940	6475940	is remembered first. The official
6475940	6477940	CD release of the soundtrack has
6477940	6479940	Tommy V. Tallarico stamped on the
6479940	6481940	front. Its booklet says composed,
6481940	6483940	produced, and performed by Tommy Tallarico
6483940	6485940	and calls Tommy a veritable video game
6485940	6487940	industry icon, of course. The half a
6487940	6489940	dozen people who collaborated with him and
6489940	6491940	wrote the other half of the songs only
6491940	6493940	appear on the back of the case at the bottom
6493940	6495940	as footnotes with stars corresponding
6495940	6497940	to which songs they actually made,
6497940	6499940	so their names don't get noticed quite as much.
6499940	6501940	Joey's song was so good, Tommy saw
6501940	6503940	fit to put it on another album with his name
6503940	6505940	and face on it. Tommy Tallarico, Virgin
6505940	6507940	Games' greatest hits. Joey's name
6507940	6509940	is even smaller on the back of this one.
6509940	6511940	It's not difficult to see
6511940	6513940	why Joey's contributions to game history
6513940	6515940	are being forgotten. Reuploads
6515940	6517940	of the full Terminator CD soundtrack onto
6517940	6519940	YouTube just say composed by Tommy.
6519940	6521940	There's a reupload of specifically Joey's
6521940	6523940	song too. The uploader who understandably
6523940	6525940	missed the tiny note on the back
6525940	6527940	of the CD case credits it to Tommy.
6527940	6529940	The top comment is a guy called
6529940	6531940	Joey Kouros explaining that he
6531940	6533940	actually made it, but also thanking people
6533940	6535940	for their kind words. We're at the point
6535940	6537940	the actual composers have to
6537940	6539940	explain they made the song in the
6539940	6541940	comments of reuploads of their work
6541940	6543940	misattributed to their old boss.
6543940	6545940	This extends back into the regular music
6545940	6547940	industry as a whole, of course, but also
6547940	6549940	into material we covered here. Michael Jackson's
6549940	6551940	long-rumored, now semi-confirmed
6551940	6553940	work on Sonic 3 isn't all it's
6553940	6555940	cracked up to be either. Like a certain other
6555940	6557940	composer, Michael had people who worked
6557940	6559940	for him. According to Brad Buxer,
6559940	6561940	an American keyboardist and composer who did
6561940	6563940	a lot of work with Jackson and actually is
6563940	6565940	credited on Sonic 3, Jackson basically
6565940	6567940	made him do most of it. Once you're well
6567940	6569940	enough established, it only gets easier to exploit
6569940	6571940	the talents of people working for you
6571940	6573940	and build up your own status on the back
6573940	6575940	of something you made someone else do.
6575940	6577940	The industry is still constructed
6577940	6579940	in a way that treats individual creators,
6579940	6581940	usually the biggest names on the project,
6581940	6583940	as the true authors, attributing a game's
6583940	6585940	success to them and not the many
6585940	6587940	people who did the work. Things are
6587940	6589940	so bad even the recipients of this
6589940	6591940	praise have called it out. To quote one of
6591940	6593940	the worst articles ever written,
6593940	6595940	there's a tendency among the press to attribute
6595940	6597940	the creation of a game to a single person,
6597940	6599940	says Warren Spector,
6599940	6601940	creator of Thief and Deus Ex.
6601940	6603940	The journalistic attitude to credit in gaming
6603940	6605940	used to be so awful it's not even
6605940	6607940	clear who wrote this. The article
6607940	6609940	is credited to IGN staff.
6609940	6611940	Basically all success and
6611940	6613940	appreciation pours directly into
6613940	6615940	selected industry figureheads even
6615940	6617940	they're actively trying to stop it from
6617940	6619940	happening and a lot of them aren't because
6619940	6621940	even if it's a problem, it's a problem that
6621940	6623940	benefits them. You can tell a lot about
6623940	6625940	an industry by how it treats the people
6625940	6627940	who actually do the work. In terms
6627940	6629940	of the scope of time, the average
6629940	6631940	game developer is...fucked.
6631940	6633940	The hundreds and sometimes thousands
6633940	6635940	of people who work on games now throw
6635940	6637940	away years of their lives and so many
6637940	6639940	of them go completely unappreciated.
6639940	6641940	Meanwhile, the most asshole-ish men
6641940	6643940	in the industry continue to promote themselves
6643940	6645940	off the back of the efforts of the people working
6645940	6647940	for them. Imagine making great sound effects
6647940	6649940	for years and years only for your boss
6649940	6651940	to tell some guy in a Halloween
6651940	6653940	mask on a live stream with a hundred views
6653940	6655940	that he did it. We don't recognize
6655940	6657940	the work and achievements of people who
6657940	6659940	make games. We recognize the people
6659940	6661940	who exploited that work the best.
6661940	6663940	It's so easy for history and
6663940	6665940	credit to get wiped away. Case in
6665940	6667940	point, we could have never learned
6667940	6669940	that the oof was from Messiah and assumed
6669940	6671940	Roblox made it forever.
6671940	6673940	But it's not even the Roblox oof.
6673940	6675940	In my household, we call it the Messiah
6675940	6677940	oof. There are thousands of people whose
6677940	6679940	good work on games will never be properly credited
6679940	6681940	who we might have already forgotten
6681940	6683940	about. Gaming is still a young medium
6683940	6685940	but already the sands of our
6685940	6687940	history are spilling through our monster
6687940	6689940	energy sodden fingers. Entire
6689940	6691940	games are at risk of being forgotten
6691940	6693940	never mind the human beings who created
6693940	6695940	them. The most valuable contribution
6695940	6697940	Tommy has made to the story is mentioning
6697940	6699940	that the voice actress was the daughter of someone
6699940	6701940	who worked at Shiny Entertainment at the time.
6701940	6703940	Her father
6703940	6705940	worked at
6705940	6707940	Shiny Entertainment. The girl
6707940	6709940	whose voice was the oof would be close to
6709940	6711940	30 now. She might even have heard it
6711940	6713940	and not even known it was her. She might not
6713940	6715940	even remember recording it. The people who know
6715940	6717940	who this was and the parent who worked
6717940	6719940	on the game, those people aren't gonna be around
6719940	6721940	forever. We have a limited time
6721940	6723940	to learn who this was. The thing
6723940	6725940	about history is it happens
6725940	6727940	and then it's gone. If we don't
6727940	6729940	work to preserve it, eventually
6729940	6731940	it becomes impossible. To quote a famous
6731940	6733940	Nintendo quitscreen,
6733940	6735940	everything not saved will be lost.
6735940	6737940	And just as a kicker how hard it is to remember
6737940	6739940	things accurately, the popularized
6739940	6741940	version of the quote is wrong. It's actually
6741940	6743940	anything not saved. I'm not trying
6743940	6745940	to be a pedant for once. It's kind of
6745940	6747940	poignant how easy it is for things to shift
6747940	6749940	like that. If we don't set a precedent
6749940	6751940	of taking people's work and the accuracy
6751940	6753940	of records of who did what seriously,
6753940	6755940	we leave it to the liars and opportunists
6755940	6757940	of the world to make up
6757940	6759940	that history to the spin-off of a
6759940	6761940	beer company to tell us who did what
6761940	6763940	and it honestly, on a spiritual
6763940	6765940	level, fills me with immense
6765940	6767940	grief thinking about the people who made
6767940	6769940	the things I care about dying
6769940	6771940	unrecognized for what they did and being
6771940	6773940	forgotten. Gaming is just old
6773940	6775940	enough that we're losing that first generation.
6775940	6777940	Tommy got the rights to
6777940	6779940	Intellivision because he bought them from the estate
6779940	6781940	of its last president when he passed away.
6781940	6783940	The name, the branding, it's his
6783940	6785940	now. The original Intellivision
6785940	6787940	YouTube channel with some of the final appearances
6787940	6789940	of its former president, one of
6789940	6791940	the world's first ever game designers
6791940	6793940	along with the original Intellivision website
6793940	6795940	with its beautiful web 1.0 history
6795940	6797940	of the company are now relegated
6797940	6799940	to obscurity under another name
6799940	6801940	while Tommy continues to use
6801940	6803940	that name to advertise a product that
6803940	6805940	doesn't even exist. The damage
6805940	6807940	to a history people are at real risk of forgetting
6807940	6809940	whose main characters
6809940	6811940	are dying might already
6811940	6813940	have been done. What history will look
6813940	6815940	like 20, 30, 100 years
6815940	6817940	in the future is being decided
6817940	6819940	now. Now is the time to
6819940	6821940	decide if Tommy Tallarico
6821940	6823940	made the oomph for Roblox
6823940	6825940	or if Joey Kuras made it for Messiah
6825940	6827940	and Tommy has already put his finger on the
6827940	6829940	scale, decided how he wants all this
6829940	6831940	to be remembered. If you buy his new
6831940	6833940	sound pack, the metadata in the
6833940	6835940	Roblox oomph has been changed to say
6835940	6837940	Tommy Tallarico. Those who fail
6837940	6839940	to learn from history are doomed to
6839940	6841940	repeat it. That's a quote commonly
6841940	6843940	attributed to Winston Churchill, but he
6843940	6845940	was actually probably paraphrasing George Santayana.
6845940	6847940	That was me being a pedant.
6847940	6849940	Old habits die hard, but here's a corollary
6849940	6851940	I came up with all by myself.
6851940	6853940	Those who let hucksters write
6853940	6855940	the history they're trying to learn from
6855940	6857940	are doomed in some other horrible
6857940	6859940	way, and for one, I
6859940	6861940	don't think history gets to be written by
6861940	6863940	a guy who wasn't even on Cribs.
6863940	6865940	It wasn't even Cribs!
6865940	6867940	Oh, hello there!
6867940	6869940	Thank you for watching this
6869940	6871940	30-minute video and a couple of
6871940	6873940	other videos.
6873940	6875940	I hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you
6875940	6877940	in the next one.
6877940	6879940	Bye!
6895940	6897940	...accompanying feature-length meltdown.
6897940	6899940	The boom mic is slowly, uh,
6899940	6901940	peeking into frame.
6901940	6903940	Anyway, thank you all so much
6903940	6905940	for watching all of this, and, uh,
6905940	6907940	I hope you had a good time, and
6907940	6909940	I hope to see you again soon...

7019940	7021940	When I bought this, uh,
7021940	7023940	gamers edition on eBay, you know, when I was
7023940	7025940	flipping through it, a bookmark fell out.
7027940	7029940	This is a bookmark for Alexander.
7029940	7031940	Well done for all your hard work
7031940	7033940	in year two this year from Miss Dunn.
7033940	7035940	Goodbye. So,
7035940	7037940	Alexander, uh, I've no
7037940	7039940	idea who you are or where you are
7039940	7041940	now or if you'll ever watch
7041940	7043940	this video. Um...
7043940	7045940	I hope you made Miss Dunn proud.
7045940	7047940	I've no idea how old you are now. This book came out in, like,
7047940	7049940	2008. I'm not gonna do the maths on that.
7049940	7051940	Um, but if you want your
7051940	7053940	bookmark back, email me,
7053940	7055940	and I'll happily send it to you.
7055940	7057940	Please do email me, in fact, because
7057940	7059940	I can't throw this out
7059940	7061940	like that would be wrong.
7061940	7063940	So this is just gonna be in my life
7063940	7065940	forever until someone claims it, so
7065940	7067940	please take this back.
